{"text":"Just so you know, I really want to love Skillet. Ive really enjoyed much of their work including their last release Rise but theres something brewing that I don't like and Unleashed displays it: John Coopers singing is dominating all the songs. The band doesnt take long enough to let any of these songs breathe and develop so they all end up sounding really, really similar; really formulaic. And its sounding old. I realize that Skillet is a modern rock band who has always placed a lot of emphasis on a lot of vocals and I like Coopers voice (most of the time) but too much sometimes is just thattoo much. I think that this album is an example of that and it reminds me of Creeds last release (Full Circle) where pretty early on I wanted Scott Stapp to stop singing so I could listen to the music (mind you, I like Stapps vocals). While Unleashed doesnt sink down to quite that level it gets close and I wish the songs were more interesting, more musically developed, and that Cooper would hold back and let the music sit on its own more or that he and drummer Jen Ledger would share vocals more than they do. This at least helps change up the dynamics between songs and helps make the album as a whole more listenable. As such I Want To Live is one of the albums better songs IMO both for the male\/female vocals and for the symphonic music. Stars and Lions may be my favorite songs off this release and they are more synth dance songs than rock songs. Meanwhile songs like Feel Invincible, Back From the Dead, Undefeated, and especially tracks Out of Hell and Burn It Down generate the my main criticisms. So all Im saying is that I want to see them break away from the mold (stadium anthems) and play around an album throughout its track list. Their last great album was Collide. I think they have one more great album in them. Heres hoping.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"Singer Chante Moore arrived in the music industry as a 24 year old unknown on the soundtrack to \"House Party II\". Her duet with Keith Washington \"Candlelight & You\" was put in regular rotation in the Quiet Storm format and had everyone's attention focused on her. In 1992, she delivered her debut \"Precious\"- which was mostly produced by George Duke and Tricky Stewart's older brother Laney Stewart. She followed it up with her second effort- the jazz inspired \"A Love Supreme\". For all of the respect she's gotten for her music, unfortunately she was relegated to the adult contemporary market despite being the around the same age as her peers in R&B. She sought to rectify that situation after taking a five year hiatus and released \"This Moment Is Mine\" in 1999. The album was mostly produced by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis with additional help from Rodney Jerkins and Jermaine Dupri. The following year, she decided to take things a step further by making the dance record \"Exposed\". While it was a Chante Moore album, it sounded like she was following trends instead of staying true to herself.\n\nShe recorded two albums with her then-husband Kenny Lattimore (\"Things That Lovers Do\" and \"Uncovered\/Covered\"), before recording another album. She resurfaced after another five years with \"Love The Woman\" in 2008 and laid low yet another five years until 2013's \"Moore Is More\". On this new album, she has a few songs that reminiscent of her earlier works. However, most of the songs are geared toward reaching a younger and wider demographic. She starts the album off with the sultry ballad \"Baby Can I Touch Your Body\". She teams up with Louis Biancaniello & Sam Watters (Best known for Jessica Simpson's song \"I Wanna Love Your Forever\") on the single about infidelity \"Talking In My Sleep\". She also works with rapper\/producer Kwame on the songs \"Alone\" and \"Doctor Doctor\". The production team Midi Mafia (Known for 50 Cent's \"21 Questions\" and Fantasia's \"When I See U\") produce the techno inspired \"On And On\", which features Da Brat working with Chante for the second time. She sings of being broken on the song \"Miss Under Stood\", which could be an unofficial sequel to her controversial song \"Bitter\", and delivers a gospel song on \"Jesus I Want You\". Overall, \"Moore Is More\" is a decent effort from Chante Moore. The album suffers from her trying to appeal to a different audience- which makes her sound horribly out of place. While it's far from being her best work, it's nice to have her back after an extended hiatus.","classification":3,"fold":5}

It is definitely a good song, but not great in regards to her style of music, a step ahead of the cheapness of Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna who've made themselves idiots in voice and song. I found the song to have a really somber and intimate mood from Christina, but more could've been added to match into the song. Still, it is a good download for your music library.

However, on this new album the band has given up what made them The 1975 I was originally drawn to. On this new album the band dives head first into Pop territory that sounds pretty close to One Direction if it weren't for the occasional guitar note. If you're hoping to hear what you heard on their first album then you may be disappointed. The lyrics are slightly odd, drums have been replaced with electronic beats, and guitar melodies are replaced with synthesizers. This change just doesn't work well throughout the entire album, but every now and again a track will stand out to me and will become slightly tolerable. Only buy this album if you can accept a more mainstream approach.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"Now...I'm a die-hard Streisand fan and have been since back in the early 60's.  Like so many others, I was looking forward to this new effort from Barbra.  I've downloaded half of the album.  The rest you can keep.  I think, and I feel this way about Frank and Tony's duet albums, what's reinforced here is that Barbra, almost without exception, sounds so much better than anyone she might pair up with.  At age 72, her voice is still matchless.  But she has to sing with those who can really hold their own with her, and fifty percent of those featured on this album just cannot.  I was almost reluctant to download \"New York State of Mind,\" for Billy Joel's voice today isn't what it was when his song first came to our attention.  But download it I did.  And I was hesitant about her duet with her son, but there's something very easy about that pairing.  It's the duet with Michael Buble which had me asking, \"Why didn't she do a whole album with him?\"  Their voices were made for duets!  I think the purpose of the album is for Barbra's efforts to say, \"Hey, I'm hip, I'm with it.\"  But, Barbra, music today is in such a horrid state of mediocrity that your choices for partnership must be from a very small pool of men who can hold their own; half of the fellows here really come out on the short end of the stick, through no fault of your own, other than you chose to sing with them and display their shortcomings.  09\/17\/14 Have decided I'm not crazy about \"New York State of Mind\" either.  However, I did catch Barbra on The Tonight Show and she and Jimmy Fallon were wonderful together!  He seemed to put her at ease and she and he had great fun.  And her performance at show's end?  Perfection!  Barbra doesn't need to sing with ANYONE!  And there are so many wonderful songs she might cover in, say, her next album.

{"text":"Arcade Fire, the alternative rock act from Montreal, Province of Quebec, Canada, released, what probably is one of the most celebrated albums of their short-time career since Funeral  and, at the same time, the most awarded of all, since they won the 2010 Grammy Awards as Best International Album. Unlike Funeral, The Suburbs seems to have a very optimistic, happy mood. On the other hand, Win Butler, Arcade Fire's bandleader said : the album itself is not aimed to be regarded as a love letter, nor an indictment of the suburbs. It is a letter from the suburbs. According to Butler, the album is a mix of Depche Mode and Neil Young. So, bearing these comments in mind, this album is certainly weird and original, not the usual disc you may find out somewhere at any record store. Highlights to consider on this album:  the title track, Ready to Start, Modern Man, Rococo, Empty Room, City With No Children, Half Light I and II, Month of May, Sprawl I and II and Suburban War. So, there you go: an excellent, unusual album from beginning to end. Don`t miss it out!","classification":5,"fold":5}

I purchased this along with about thirty others from the period because I was sitting around feeling nostalgic for my youth and the days I shared with some friends in a band in Detroit (EVERYone in Detroit in the sixties was in a band).  Gloria, Midnight hour, old Stones favorites -- these were the elements of our playlists.  The three-chord simplicity of these old tunes seemed a refreshing reshaping of the blues that gave birth to them. It's been great listening to this and the others I purchased along with it.

{"text":"Tame Impala, the in-studio one-man band of Australian Kevin Parker, issued an outstanding second album in 2012 called Lonerism, which I had as my No. 2 ranked album of the year. The album became an unexpected critical success, and on the road, Tame Impala quickly became a fan and festival favorite. After endless touring, now finally comes Tame Impalas highly anticipated third album.\n\nCurrents (13 tracks; 51 min.) starts with the lead-off single, the 8 min. Let It Happen, which is a slow-burner which eventually becomes a monster jam. Nangs is a quick intermezzo, and next up is Moment, an easily accessible and upbeat track which feels like this shouldve been the lead-off single. Yes, Im Changing simply affirms what we already discerned: Kevin Parker keeps evolving (Yes I'm changing, yes I'm gone\/Yes I'm older, yes I'm moving on). Eventually is another mid-tempo song, with lots of textured synthesizers. After another quick intermezzo (Gossip), we crash into The Less I Know The Better, a great upbeat track, reminding me of Elephant. Past Life is a delicious dreamy tune. It all leads up to Cause Im a Man (2nd single), already celebrated as the musical statement of Currents, due to its Prince-reminding vibe. Yes, THAT Prince. Its not my favorite moment of the album, but thats just me. For example, I like the track that follows, the harder charging Reality In Motion, a lot better. The album closes with New Person, Same Old Mistakes, which captures the album perfectly: slightly slower, yet more extraverted. Welcome to the new Tame Impala!\n\nJust last month I saw Tame impala in concert again, at the rapidly growing Bunbury Music Festival here in Cincinnati. Toward the end of an epic day 1 of the festival,  Kevin Parker & Co. started their set just as a huge thunderstorm ravaged through the fest. The guys soldiered on for about 5 or 6 tracks (including an epic Let It Happen) before they literally had no choice but to stop playing out of safety concerns. A shame but it was fantastic while it lasted, even in the pouring rain. It surely will not be the last time I catch these guys in concert. Meanwhile, Currents is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"I was initially happy to get such a big collection for such a low price.  Listening in the background, while I did office work, didn't seem to contradict that.\n\nBut then when I got to Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, I took a break and turned up the volume to listen more closely.  Aargh!  My first impression was:  muddy sound.  Then I thought I heard more problems, so I loaded the file into an audio editing program to analyze what was going on.  The basic recording is in MONO.  Not only that, but when I paid attention, I could hear surface noise from a phonograph record playback!  Clearly, this was dubbed from an old LP.  Indeed, there seems to be a bit of stereophonic reverberation added, which probably accounts for some (if not all) of the muddiness I hear.\n\nWhat's more, as another reviewer points out, this does not sound like a mere quartet (it's listed as The Griller Quartet, which was active from 1931 until about 1963)... it seems to be a much larger ensemble.\n\nI note that there are several other tracks from the Griller Quartet; I haven't had time to analyze them all.  Hopefully some of them are better quality than this, especially because some feature William Primrose who was a notably excellent violist.\n\nAnother reviewer has noted disappointing audio in the Symphony nr. 40 and I concur.  Again, close listening and analysis shows that it's an original mono recording.  Again, there's a small amount of stereophonic \"muddiness\" which seems to be fake reverb.\n\n(For anyone who has the means to do so, I strongly recommend you decode the relevant tracks, make a full mono (L+R) mix to get rid of the background garble, then re-encode them at 320kbps to prevent further degradation.  But even so, the result will certainly not be nearly as good as current recordings should sound.)\n\nIf I were to rate just the above mentioned selections, they would get just one star.  Part of that is because the quality could be a lot better, and part of that is because Amazon has not  warned us anywhere about how bad they sound.  Since I have not had time to analyze all 131 tracks, I will hope that most of the rest are much better, and I'll just knock the rating down to four stars, at this point in time.  Hopefully I won't find any more glaring problems like these.","classification":4,"fold":5}

There is not a track on the album that I don't like, and Workin' Woman Blues is a standout.  Hope music lovers sit up and take notice of her.  She's so original and her music is very rich and organic, which should appeal to even purists.  Download this single now and take a listen while it's free on here.  She plays several instruments and has talent and style galore.  Watch for her to become a huge mover and shaker on the music scene directly.

{"text":"The quest to acquire all of \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's music continues... and brings me to his fourth studio album and one of the admitted \"low points\" of Al's career.  After the phenomenal success of his first three albums, it must have been a shock for Al's fans (as well as himself) for his fourth album to be a flop in comparison.  In fact, many critics and even Al himself believed \"Polka Party\" would be his swan song and mark the end of his career.  Nearly thirty years later, of course, we know that's not true, but all the same, this album is often highlighted as a \"valley\" in his career, and most of its songs have been largely forgotten (with at least one outrageous exception).\n\nAfter listening to this album, I'm inclined to agree with the critics -- while still fun, it's not Al's best, and while I enjoy a few of the songs, others are largely forgettable.\n\nAl is best known for his parodies, and they make up about half of this album.  Of said parodies, my favorite would have to be \"Addicted to Spuds,\" his parody of Robert Palmer's \"Addicted to Love.\"  Food songs are practically a tradition for him by now, and this number takes Palmer's energetic original and turns it into an ode to the tuber.  \"Living With a Hernia,\" a parody of James Brown's \"Living In America,\" isn't quite as fun in my opinion, but it's a nice tribute to the original and shows that Al's capable of taking on a wide variety of musical styles.  The other parodies include \"Here's Johnny\" (El DeBarge's \"Who's Johnny\"), a tribute to Ed McMahon of the Johnny Carson Show; \"Toothless People\" (Mick Jagger's \"Ruthless People\"), which sounds curiously uninspired and without much effort put into the lyrics; and his by-now-customary polka mix in the titular \"Polka Party,\" which includes samples from various hits such as \"Harlem Shuffle,\" \"Venus,\" \"Sussidio,\" \"Rock Me Amadeus,\" and \"Papa Don't Preach.\"\n\nThe originals are a mixed bag as well.  I didn't particularly care for \"Dog Eat Dog\" or \"Don't Wear Those Shoes,\" but I enjoyed the twangy country-western style of \"Good Enough For Now,\" as well as its hilarious lyrics that pay tribute to a \"just about average\" love interest.  \"One Of Those Days\" would have to be my favorite of the originals, as Al gripes about the various minor and major accidents and disasters that have befallen him today, ranging from losing a sock in the dryer to angry mobs burning crosses on his lawn -- and yes, it's the juxtaposition of the ridiculously major and hilariously minor disasters that make this song funny.\n\nThe most infamous number from this album would have to be \"Christmas At Ground Zero,\" the result of his record label requesting that he write a Christmas song -- you would really think that they would have learned their lesson about telling Al what to do from \"Girls Just Wanna Have Lunch.\"  A merry and jingly tune carries some of the most disturbing lyrics of all time, detailing a Christmas celebrated after the nuclear bombs drop and reduce the world to a radioactive wasteland... and to top it off, the song ends with an air raid siren.  Even before 9\/11 gave the term \"Ground Zero\" its far more tragic second meaning, it's a disturbing song... and yet weirdly hilarious at the same time.  Al may be goofy, but he also excels at black comedy.\n\nDefinitely not Al's best album, though a few hits do keep it from being a total wash.  If you're an Al completionist, go ahead and buy the album, but if you just want his best songs, I recommend you simply buy downloads of \"Addicted To Spuds\" and \"One Of Those Days,\" and maybe \"Christmas At Ground Zero\" if you don't mind some morbid humor.  Otherwise, save a full album purchase for \"Dare To Be Stupid\" or \"Mandatory Fun.\"","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"\"Shine your light, Shine your light on me\"\n\nOn November 17, 1978, Bob Dylan picked up a silver cross that was tossed on stage by a fan at a concert in San Diego, California, that was nearly marking the end of a year-long tour. He then had a vision of Christ while in a Tuscon, Arizona, hotel room, and - at the final tour date in Miami, Florida - debuted a new song, Do Right to Me Baby (Do Unto Others), which began the merging of Dylan's new personal faith as a born-again Christian with his music to produce his greatest studio effort ever.\n\nReleased in August 1979, Dylan's trek into Christian teachings and philosophy are heard in the nine songs, that clock in at about 47 minutes, with the album reaching number three on the U.S. and number two on the U.K. album charts.\n\n\"I just can't make it by myself\"\n\nThough most of the instrumental focus is rightfully on the Muscle Shoals Horns and Mark Knopfler (g) & Pick Withers (d) of Dire Straits, the powerful background vocals of Carolyn Dennis, Helena Springs and Regina Havis place exclamation points on the powerful gospel numbers.\n\nGotta Serve Somebody does not skirt the stark consequences when a person willfully elects to pursue the avenues of evil. Precious Angel has an utterly beautiful melody and you will not hear as powerful a sermon from any pulpit as found in Gonna Change My Way Of Thinking. The guitar solos by Knopfler on Slow Train compliments the classic Dylan lyrics and America 2007 is found in When You Gonna Wake Up, as provocative a protest song - written for 1970s America - ever penned by Dylan.\n\n\"I'm a little too blind to see\"\n\nBut the song, I Believe in You, which concerns being cast out due to unpopular religious beliefs, seemingly set the stage for a six-month tour - starting on November 1, 1979 - to promote the album. Dylan would not play older compositions - radio ads and other media material informed fans of the tour structure - and he oftentimes spent portions of the concerts lecturing hecklers who yelled out song requests or derided him for his Christian beliefs.\n\nBut what was lost in much of the critical noise then is Dylan's powerful messages of protest\/patriotism, fellowship, friendship and love - themes that he had written about in the past - were given additional meaning when a rainbow of promise & hope appeared in his life. That he wanted to share his faith with others made his personal mission to spread the gospel even more wondrous.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"When it has came down to Michael Jackson, he was arguably one of the most remarkable artists that had ever lived in our modern times. But honestly, it has nearly been seven years since his tragic death occurred, and the world mourned at once because his passing from drugs, sedatives and abuse he had suffered for years. I definitely do not think Michael Jackson had ever forgotten how much he was accused of a pedophile and how so many of the things he was accused of hurt him at the very end of his own life back in 2009. He had very few good songs though that Michael recorded before he passed away that really showed a lot of heart when he was going through a lot of strife. Cry from his failed Invincible album actually was a good and somber ballad, but never got the recognition Michael wanted from the album. The song is very somber and shows just how dark the world could be with so much hatred going on the world. It is a beautiful song, but more could've been done to make sure this song had the success overall. It is a very underrated song worth listening to, for die hard Michael Jackson fans, and new ones alike.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"It is said that imitation is the best form of flattery. If this is true, the fact that several years after its release, the opening \"Angel\" continues to appear on Original Soundtracks should speak volumes. From the first chord, the third album by the band that brought trip-hop to us along with Portishead and Morcheeba is yet another classic. At several points, it feels like a precedent to some of the chillout acts to come in later years (remember this was released in 1998). With a tight bass sound streaming from song to song, a sexy beat and a hypnotic keyboard frame to it all, this album lacks nothing, and raises the bar above their previous 'Protection' where the main thing I miss is the participation of Everything But The Girl's vocalist, Tracy Horn.

{"text":"Mumford & Sons banjo\/accordion-driven sound sold them millions of albums worldwide. For album number three, the banjo gets replaced with electric guitars and synths, inspired they say by Radiohead and Led Zeppelin.\n\nMore like U2 or Coldplay, if you ask me. Upbeat rocker \"Tompkins Square Park\" opens the album, catchy and anthemic with shimmery synths and chiming guitars, and the line \"I only ever told you one lie, but it could have been a thousand, It might as well have been a thousand\". Like that? There's a few more; the chugging \"The Wolf\", \"Just Smoke\" (with the line \"I'm not strong enough to cradle the weight of your love\"), and \"Ditmas\" (which retains a bit of their folky sensibilities in its chorus).\n\nThe mood is melancholic for the most part, and this includes the best moments. Lead single \"Believe\" begins with gentle synths and Marcus Mumford's vocals pushed to the fore before a squeal of guitars heralds rattling percussion and a stadium-sized chorus. The title track is a highlight, a haunting piece on which Marcus discovers his inner Bono, while the anthemic bluesy \"Monster\" must have been nicked from Chris Martin - you know, the same drawer that held \"Fix You\".\n\n\"Snake Eyes\" is another highlight, gently pulsing with harrowing effects swirling in the background and a trilling guitar coda. The Beatles-esque \"Broad-Shouldered Beasts\" is hymnal, as are the similar \"Cold Arms\" and \"Hot Gates\", while \"Only Love\" picks up its pace for a driving climax.\n\nIt could easily had ended up an anodyne affair but the lads put just enough of that extra something to take things to another level. It's not such a radical change in direction as one can still imagine most of these songs done with Banjos and acoustic guitars. Not so wild after all.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"It turns out the old saying is true: The family that plays together, stays together. Four siblings and their best pal make up indiepop group Eisley, whose debut EPs hinted at what they could do. And \"Room Noises\" certainly proves that their airy, whimsical pop was worth the long wait for.\n\nSome of the songs are from those EPs, although they sound a bit tighter and smoother. For example, the heartbreaking ode to the bullied, \"Telescope Eyes,\" or the prettily whimsical \"Marvelous Things.\" Despite the airy poesy of the songs, there's a distinctly melancholy streak through the album, which peaks at the very beginning: \"Memories,\" a haunting song about a woman mourning her husband's suicide.\n\nDespite a few EP songs, they also have quite a few new songs, like the enchantingly sunny \"Golly Sandra,\" which has echoes of the Beach Boys. But the sparkling pop vibe continues in other songs, carried over in piano melodies and smooth guitar riffs. \"Still floating soft\/I am dreaming and I'm glad I lost\/And still with my fingers\/I'm drawing circles in the water,\" the song goes, as fluid as the water it talks about.\n\nThat mixture of bittersweetness and innocent optimism is what makes Eisley so darn appealing. Nowhere are the stereotypical I-just-wanna-have-fun or my-boy\/girlfriend-dumped-me-and-now-I-wanna-swim-with-the-toaster music for THIS pop band. While they have some love songs, the emphasis is on their enchanting kind of whimsy.\n\nThat whimsy carries over into just about whatever they sing about, whether it's Sherri and Staci singing about dragons in the woods, sunlight and butterflies, or metal teeth and \"telescope eyes.\" Some of the lyrics seem to stray into Flaming Lips-type surrealism, but are also grounded by simple sentiments like, \"You have shining eyes, yes like those forest lights, and it makes me want to cry.\"\n\nAfter the past few years, with the group rapidly moving out of the teen bracket, one would wonder if Stacy and Sherri Dupree's angelic vocals would have gotten... well, not so pretty. No problem with that -- they sound a bit like younger versions of Beth Gibbons or perhaps Hope Sandoval. The two girls even interplay their vocals in on song, with remarkable skill and spine-tingling results.\n\nAt the start of one song, the line \"Congratulations, we've finally made it\" is sung. And so Eisley has -- and this promising band only shows signs of getting even better in albums to come.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"ALL MY FAVORITE SONGS FROM THE FOLK DAYS IN SCHOOL LUV THE ARTISTS AND THEIR MUSIC.  IT WAS GOOD IN THE 80'S AND IT IS GOOD NOW","classification":5,"fold":5}
{"text":"I was really excited for this album.  After the self titled album I thought they'd found their way, but I was wrong. this sounds like a more piano driven version of something Geoff Tate would do except his vocals would be awful.  It has all the trademarks of his work over the past decade and a half; a bunch of ballads, slow uninteresting and forgettable music, no hooks, no particular tone nor emotional connection to the listener, no consideration as to what the fans would want to hear, bad lyrics.  I may be forgetting something but you get the idea.\n\nOk so what's wrong with this album?  Well for starters there's NOTHING memorable about this album.  It's seriously painful to try to listen to front to back when there's absolutely nothing catching my attention.  There are a bleep ton of ballads.  The album has to be a minimum of half ballads if not more.  Now look Dream Theater has some amazing ballads in their catalog, usually an exception rather than the rule especially once Kevin More left but still they've had some amazing ones, but none of these are on the same level as any of those classic songs and frankly they haven't written a great ballad in a long time, a couple decent ones over the past decade but none have been great.  Then there's the whole rock opera thing.  I guess that's a genre some people like but I absolutely hate it, though in fairness this is my first and it's exactly what I think of when I hear the term.  Another reviewer already stated some of this music sounds like Disney music and it so does especially the overly bubbly happy chorus to one of the few semi better constructed songs on disc 1, towards the end but I forget its name.\n\nWhat happened to the song structures?  Dream Theater use to be a band that would give you an album of 7 to 9 songs clocking in at about 75 minutes.  I'll admit some of those songs could use some trimming especially on Train of Thought, but that's the style most fans have gotten use to, and there'd be something incredible on every album.  Not here.  We get a bunch of 3 and 4 minute, at most, songs with several 1 and 2 minute tracks thrown in there, and they don't even construct them properly.  Take a 3 1\/2 minute song they'll have a 1 1\/2 minute intro and leave about 2 minutes to dedicate to the actual song, if it ever gets going.\n\nThis album is also a heavily Jordan featured album.  I've said it before he's the worst thing to ever happen to Dream Theater.  I hate the man as a musician with everything that I am.  I'm tired of his circus music, boring piano pieces and nonsensical and unnecessary contributions to the band.  He was fine on Scenes from a Memory and hit and miss on 6 Degrees but he's been awful ever since.  I really hope these guys don't become the new 1999-2012 Queensryche cause while I enjoyed making fun of them it really came from a place of sadness, witnessing a once great band become a waste of anything involved in the making, producing and listening to  of any of their albums. I don't want that to become these guys.\n\nAlready this is the worst album of 2016 for me.  I don't care what else is released.  Already this year we've had albums by Megadeth-a good album, and Primal Fear-so so but better than this.  This thing is seriously so bad I listened to Kiss after, mother you know what KISS!!  That's how terible this is that anything Kiss has ever done, even their most silly cheesy uninteresting or over the top song is still better than this trash.  I would rather listen to In Flames's Siren Charms.  Yes it's an awful attempt at mainstream radio rock from a band that shouldn't attempt it but it had 2 good songs and wasn't 2 discs and over 30 tracks.  heck the bonus tracks were even ok.  Heck I'd rather listen to Q2k, Mindcrime 2, and American Soldier many times over before hearing this again.  Heck even Dedicated to chaos had 1 ok song.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing on here that's any good.  3 songs; A Better Life, A Life Left Behind and Moment Of Betrayal are ok as in if they were the weakest songs on an album of actual good songs they'd be worth listening enough that you wouldn't need to skip them.\n\nOh and this is really a John Petrucci solo album not a Dream Theater album, much like Q2k-Dedicated to chaos are Geoff Tate solo albums.  this isn't good and no one should ever have this in their collection for nay reason EVER.  But listen to it before you buy it. If you like it then by all means get it but be sure to listen to the whole thing first.\n\nOh and Def Leppard's self titled album is also better which is just sad.  If you want a good prog metal album pick up anything by Symphony X especially their 2 most recent albums.  Now that's a band that can show off their talent and write good songs.\n\nIn closing this album makes me angry.  It shouldn't I suppose but it does.  This is one of the worst albums I've ever heard a band I like put out and I won't support this garbage.","classification":1,"fold":5}

{"text":"Slaughterhouse is a rap group comprised of Royce Da 5'9\", Crooked I, Joe Budden, and Joel Ortiz. Signed on Eminem's Shady label, Eminem serves as executive producer, featured artist, songwriter, and producer throughout.  Overall, well crafted,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Welcome-To-Our-House-Explicit\/dp\/B008Y0X1MM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Welcome To: Our House [Explicit<\/a>] never quite reaches `valedictory.'\n\nThe album opens with the intro \"The Slaughter,\" which is produced by Eminem and features rap vocals by Marv Won; Chainsaw sound effects represent `the slaughter' while moody piano enters towards the end, foreshadowing \"Our House.\"\n\n\"Our House\" features Eminem as well as frequent hip-hop collaborative go-to Skylar Grey.  Produced by Alex Da Kid. the drums are gargantuan in sound, buttressing this mysterious opener. Eminem sings one of two hooks propelling \"Our House\": \"I wanna be the best who ever did it\/Don't know if that goal is feasible, or it isn't\/but if it is then God, if your listenin'\/please give the strength to crush all the competition...\" Grey also has her own significant moment: \"So welcome, to our house\/where no one, comes back out\/ you won't find, comfort\/in here, in here, in here.\" Despite its lengthiness, \"Our House\" is epic.\n\n\"Coffin\" features Busta Rhymes (hook). Produced by Hit-Boy, the production is solid, particularly the drum programming.  The cut comes off clunky and less satisfying compared to \"Our House.\" \"Coffin\" misses the `elite' of Welcome.\n\n\"Throw That,\" featuring\/co-produced by Eminem, and produced by T-Minus, contains elements from \"Throw the D\" (2 Live Crew) and \"It Takes Two.\" Eminem rips through the NSFW hook.  Royce Da 5'9 handles the first verse, followed by Crooked I, Budden, and Ortiz on respective verses.  Add a sound bridge and Slaughterhouse delivers another strong track. \n\"Hammer Dance\" is more appealing here than as its was upon its promo issue.  Featuring elements of  \"Falling Away From Me,\" Royce anchors it down with his hook: \"I'm in the club, bottle in my hand doing my two step\/while I got my gun in my pants, call it the hammer dance...\"  The remaining members of Slaughterhouse handle verses (Ortiz, Crooked I, and Budden).\n\n\"Get Up,\" produced by NO I.D delivers a cut with a sound described as old-school in quality.  The biggest drawback of \"Get Up\" is its five minute duration.  It eclipses The Cee Lo Green assisted \"My Life,\" which feels ever so slightly generic.  Produced by STREETRUNNERS, Cee Lo's overt, somewhat brash hook that is a bit off-putting. A bridge by Green runs by, taking further away from his usual soulfulness.  All members of Slaughterhouse rap here, but none of the verses necessarily `stand out.'\n\n\"We Did It (Skit)\" precedes the captivating \"Flip A Bird,\" which contains a sample from \"Little Bird\" written and performed by Imogen Heap.  The hook is catchy by all means. All members of Slaughterhouse receive a verse, though Crooked I gets a lyrical highlight: \"Let me get it now\/on Twitter, they murder my mentions, cause they heard I was served by a circle of henchmen...\"\n\n\"Throw It Away\" is arguably the best cut. Produced by Mr. Porter and featuring an energized Swizz Beatz, \"Throw It Away\" has hit written all over it.  All of the verses by Slaughterhouse are solid, but it just may be Swizz Beatz's moments that steal the show: \"You know I ain't Bill Gates honey\/but I'mma act like I ain't never had money and throw it away... you know I ain't Jay-Z honey\/but I'mma act like I ain't never had money...\" Well produced and conceived, \"Throw It Away\" is amongst the elite.\n\n\"Rescue Me\" gives Skylar Grey another guest spot though does not eclipse her showing on \"Our House.\" The rhymes aren't individually noteworthy, but the track as a whole yields some solid moments. \"Frat House\" is another B-level cut, featuring sound production work by T-Minus, though doesn't live up to the same hype lyrically.  The hook is true to the connotation given to a frat house, evidenced by its hook.  Royce handles verse 1, Crooked I verse two (\"LBC, we them beach boys\/we don't need your education\/we Pink Floyd), while Joe Budden and Joell Ortiz duel on verse 4 (\"...Bend over, take her to church now she in U-Mass...\")\n\n\"Goodbye,\" produced by Boi-1da opts for piano as opposed to the rawer sounds exhibited in cuts \"Frat House.\" The hook is sung by Ming, who is only credited in the credits within the jacket. Royce fails to appear here, letting the other members hold down the cut.\n\n\"Park It Sideways,\" produced by Kane Beatz, features a catchy hook and works well over the bright production.  All four members have their say here, with the verses segued into pairs (Royce\/Budden and Crooked I\/Ortiz).\n\n\"Die,\" produced by Mr. Porter gives Slaughterhouse another top-notch cut. Joell Ortiz sits out, but Joe Budden wins the rap battle here: \"...New bodies on old heaters\/we ain't rapped too tight\/starving, they thought Jeffrey Dahmer had an appetite...\" \"Our Way (Outro)\" closes the effort.  It is not really notable unfortunately, making the top-rate \"Die\" seem the true closing cut.\n\nOverall,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Welcome-To-Our-House-Explicit\/dp\/B008Y0X1MM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Welcome To: Our House [Explicit<\/a>] is another solid rap album. Its flaws here don't take much away from the good thing that Em and Slaughterhouse have going on here.  My top 3 favorites:  (1) \"Throw It Away,\" featuring Swizz Beatz (2) \"Our House,\" featuring Eminem & Skylar Grey, (3) \"Throw That,\" featuring Eminem.  Solid overall.","classification":3,"fold":5}

When I listen to his own music, I continue to think of why so many singers do not continue to grow and adapt with their sound at heart. When he had announced earlier this year that he was retiring from touring, I was not at all very shocked with his decision. He has been well advanced with his own heart, and his work continues to inspire. His song Where Are You Now?, which originally appeared on his last album The Next Day is classic Bowie at heart, and shows it by the simplicity of his own voice. He really shows it very nobly, and shows that he has not changed after all this time with his most deepest of songs. If you have loved Let's Dance or Heroes, than you'll absolutely love this song a lot. He still is here now, and will never go away.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"I have a few grips (see below) however I cannot bring myself to give this any less than 5 stars due to the bargain that it is.  It's such a tragedy that more people aren't as familiar with Haydn as they are with Mozart.  Haydn was such a wonderful man both personally and professionally.  The amount of music he put out almost seemed supernatural, and most of it was later in life!  Even relative to today's life expectancy he was pretty old when he wrote some of his best works!\n\nOK, here are my gripes (and I hope Bach Guild will take them under consideration):\n\n1. Track 6 - Symphony No. 75 in D Major, (Hob. I\/75): iii. is cut off at the beginning...a few counts are missing.\n2. The Haydn Symphonies referred to in Bach Guild's description is not available anymore.  I want to buy them.  Take my money, Bach Guild!!!\n3. Please provide FLAC copies, not just MP3s.

He is a prime example that everyone's sophomore album can be just as good as the debut.  The album's tracklisting is all around great, from the order of the songs to the lyrics and instruments.\n\n \"Still Ghetto\" is about love and relationships for the most part.  Jaheim seduces and croons his female listeners practically the entire album.  \"Put that Woman First\" is the mid-tempo track that was released and went on to be a hit for 2003.  Jaheim explains that if a man does not make a woman feel that she is at the top of his list, she may leave him for another man who will.  A lot of women and even men like this song.  Jaheim showcases his seduction skills on the song \"Special Day\".  In this song Jaheim tells his woman it is her day and asks her what she would like to do.  It is a slow song with a beautiful message and melody.  \"Everywhere I Am is Jaheim's dedication to his late mother, Julie.  In the song he lets his mom know that whatever he does, he feels her presence, even in the biggest events of his life.  This song is truly heartfelt to anyone has either lost their mother or has a close bond with her.  Another favorite on \"Still Ghetto\" is Jaheim's duet with Mary J. Blige called \"Beauty and a Thug\"  This song is about a man and a woman from different walks of life who attract each other. This is a lovely song.\n\n \"Still Ghetto\" is one of those CD's that anyone who gives it a complete listen is sure to love.  Jaheim takes being ghetto to a whole new level!

{"text":"March 4, 2009\n\nAs a young man finding my way in New York City there were what the residents called public baths. This was a very long time ago but as a music fan even then, I remember a young, explosive female entertainer named Bette Midler who would entertain at these baths accompanied by her pianist, Barry Manilow. Of course they would later break away from each other to become each outrageously loved and successful show business personalities. There were definitive differences with Barry Manilow becoming a much more  conservative recording artist whereas Bette is the nouveau Lucille Ball with a comedic lasciviousness that generations have enjoyed immensely. My wife and I waited in an endless, serpentine line to see Barry Manilow do a show at the Garden back in 1981. Once inside, we immediately noticed his engaging smile and friendly persona which is nothing short of contagious. His material, as evidenced by the classic Weekend in New England ranks amongst the finest songwriting in American music. In Barry's case, whether another classic of his I Write the Songs classifies him as a 100% singer songwriter is irrelevant. We appreciate him as a captivating singer who is an authentic charmer. That is exactly how Barry Manilow can credit his gargantuan success since the days of playing the piano and appearing with Bette Midler in New York's public baths. I would have to say that his vocals and keyboard playing are indeed highly professional. His strength is to light up any room he walks into and then you have have to add one of the most highly regarded song catalogs music fans have ever appreciated.\n\nJay Adler, Music Critic","classification":5,"fold":5}

Sure it starts out strong with the three tracks they released prior to the album coming out, which isn't unusual. \"The Threat Is Real\" being the best, imo. Dystopia (the track) starts off kind of weak but then goes off into a pretty good hook and chorus, with Chris Adler behind the kit, kicking away. Where the album starts to dissipate is somewhere near the middle. With songs like \"Bullet To The Brain\" an obvious hard look at child molestation, \"Post American World\"  which is one of Daves usual political tracks that sounds like something from The System Has Failed. And \"Poisonous Shadows\" which to me has one of the worst choruses I've ever heard Dave write. Even after several spins of the track it's just not there. The passion seems to be forced.\n\nI know a lot of people will hate me, or think yeah this guy is just some wiener who knows nothing about music. Which is far from the truth, after listening to this band for about 25 out of the 30 years or so they have been around, they have had their ups and downs. Well to me this has both, but more down then up. I think most of that is due to the various member changes in the last 15 years, which I can't even count. Some bands it helps, others not so much. Megadeth's most solid and successful lineup were Mustaine, Friedman, Ellefson (of course) and Menza. And I think Chris Adler has to much talent as a drummer to play some of the mainstream, \"straight forward\" music of MD. He's so great at blast beats, cymbal accents and double bass. This is just below him. This coming form a drummer (from two bands) of 30+ years, starting at about 6. None of the Big Four really have it anymore. So it may be that I'm use to the good old thrash that never sold their souls to the music industry.\n\nThat would include, Overkill, Testament, Forbidden (R.I.P), Kreator, SODOM, Soulfly from 2005 till now, Sepultura (Max) and many others. They are the real deal. Megadeth have some good tracks here, but nothing that just blows you away. They just sound so tired and worn out. Especially Daves riffs, where are the technical progressions, diverse choruses, and speed? I mean a song like The Emperor (who has no clothes, as Dave says) just doesn't cut it. Nor does the FEAR covers of Foreign Policy. So pass on this one. I haven't been a Dream Theater fan for over 12 years,but at least it sounds like they are going back to the \"Images and Words\"days, which is great. And I'm actually finally psyched for an album. Lets hope they don't let me down, like this one did. It doesn't down right \"suck\" but it's not worth more than one listen. Actually I think United Abominations and Endgame were much better. :)","classification":3,"fold":5}

I picked this up when I saw it in a store because I figured a \"Best of\" album was a good way to get all of his good songs that I remembered. In addition to \"I Want Her\", I remembered \"Don't Stop Your Love\", \"Twisted\", the collaboration with Snoop Dogg, \"There You Go Telling Me No Again\", the LSG song \"My Body\" and \"Nobody\".

{"text":"With KISS Paul Stanley proved to be somewhat of a musical chameleon. In the late 70s it was disco-pop, in the 80s it was pop-metal and there was even a grunge inspired album (1997's \"Carnival of Souls\"). Through it all, however, KISS's albums were usually pretty solid, as Stanley is a fine (and certainly underrated) songwriter. \"Live to Win,\" (2006) Paul Stanley's first solo album in nearly thirty-years is a return to 80s sounding melodic-hard-rock. However, because the album has a crisp, modern production, it avoids sounded dated.\n\nAlthough I usually despise Desmond Child and feel he has wussafied many a hard-rock band, his contributions actually work really well here. \"Live to Win\" is a fine collection of pop-metal, with each song sounding tight with an infectious groove and good hook. In fact, \"Live to Win\" is probably the best album Stanley has churned out since KISS's \"Animalize\" (1984). Clocking in at just over a half hour, \"Live to Win\" avoids being clotted with filler. Guest guitarists Bruce Kullick and John 5's solos are as tasty as anything from KISS\"s glory days making \"Live to Win\" a sure winner with the KISS ARMY.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"I first heard of Shovels and Rope through publicity of shows featuring The Lumineers, becoming acquainted with their live work before their studio recordings.\n\nThis is their second recording as a husband-wife group, and there is no sophomore slump here.  The atmosphere and expert lyric writing that made their first record enjoyable and provocative in their first self-titled album is present here.  The production value of O' Be Joyful is noticeably higher.  There is added instrumentation here and there, and other audio effects, but the album remains that simple, organic Americana that made the first album so appealing.  These are musicians that are not afraid to grow, but who know what their musical roots are.\n\nIt's hard to believe sometimes that they started out as solo artists; their voices blend so naturally.  Sometimes Mr. Trent takes lead, and sometimes Ms. Hearst does.  They support each other at times while allowing the other to shine.  Supplementing the tuneful melodies is harmonic composition that is so expertly done, that you wish more music was still made this way.  Both voices are strong and memorable; her voice is refreshingly more Dolly, less Taylor, if you know what I mean.\n\nListen to the progression of the first track, \"Birmingham\", and in particular how their voices in unison over an acoustic guitar breaks out into harmony while layers of instrumentation are added.  What a great way to start the album, and a lesson in good songwriting.\n\nAtmosphere is what appealed to me in their first album, and there is much of that here.  The last track \"This Means War\" is a real standout, and makes for such a personal artistic statement: the mark of a true artist is the ability to convey his or her vulnerability.  The song takes the form of a triple time 'marche funebre'\/passacaglia in classical tradition, appropriately fitting the lyrics which are based on the timeless theme of death and loss.  Cary Ann's resonant harmonics and an added fiddle over a low, droning bass (an organ?) make for an atmospheric musical experience.  The addition of sound clips of Cary Ann as a little girl having a conversation with her grandfather, in which her grandfather imparts some important advice, is part of what makes this album, and this song in particular, a really special project.  Shovels and Rope, after all, is technically their \"family band.\"\n\nAnother mark of good artistry is contrast.  Take, for example, \"Kemba's Got the Cabbage Moth Blues,\" a short, fast-paced, rollicking piece with a memorable sing-along-inducing chorus.  Their ability to write a short piece with economical means that resonates with the listener is something I can only attribute to The Lumineers and Shovels and Rope, as far as current artists are concerned.\n\nIn short, there is much to recommend to this album.  They convey fun, seriousness, pain, and happiness effectively and honestly.  If you are looking for a current artist of group of artists who still practice that lost art of storytelling through songwriting, you've found them.  That's rare these days.  Cary and Michael also grow as artists, but stay true to their musical foundations.","classification":5,"fold":5}

This one falls under the more poppy category, and is indeed very catchy but she still provides a great variety of music-writing that I've come to enjoy from her.

{"text":"The first few times I heard this album, I thought it was a bit disappointing. However, They Want My Soul has really grown on me. In past reviews, I have referred to Spoon as the most consistently strong band out there. All of their albums are very good, a few even great. This is in the very good category. Once again, they've added a little more to their sound while keeping their identity.  \"Inside Out\" shows the band using mood very well with its dreamy keyboards and textures, similar to some of Radiohead's work. \"Outliner\" is pure dance rock and its beat is infectious. \"Rainy Taxi\" shows the band going back to their tried and true indie rock sound and is the first very strong track here. \"Do You\" is the song getting the airplay and with good reason. Containing a sunny melody and its vocal hook, it is one of their catchiest songs period. Spoon's lyrics are still a strong suit as shown on the cerebral \"I Just Don't Understand\" and \"Knock Knock Knock\" and the musical backdrop fits these songs perfectly. The closing track, \"New York Kiss\", along with the aforementioned \"Do You\" are the best songs here and all of the other songs not mentioned are at least decent. So if you like Spoon's other albums, you'll like this one. Just let it grow on you before you form an opinion.","classification":4,"fold":5}

If you like Country\n\nRock, Country Blues, Honky Tonk, genuine Rock 'n Roll and mix all this\n\ntogether with a few ballads, you'll have this CD to experience some\n\nincredible music. OK, it's dedicated to Christmas and the lyrics do\n\ninclude these seasonal holidays but that's all. The first two songs\n\nare absolutely a knock-out and the rest is pure pleasure as well.\n\nIt's comparable to their firts CD, by far the best, called \"The Tractors\"\n\nfrom 1994. Not one minor song out of the 12 presented here. Even the\n\nsole piano version of White Christmas is a \"different\" approach to this\n\nmostly recorded Xmas song ever.

{"text":"\"See You in September\" is an excellent song by Sid Wayne and Sherman Edwards. It was first recorded by The Tempos in 1959 but I think this rendition by The Happenings is superior. The Happenings perform this with much more energy than The Tempos ever did and just one listen tells you their hearts were truly in it! Indeed, \"See You in September\" was a major number 1 breakout hit for The Happenings in 1966, so much so that their version even reached R.I.A.A. gold disc status!\n\nThe original members of The Happenings performing here include Bob Miranda, David Libert, Tom Giuliano and Ralph DiVito; and they do a superb job on \"See You in September.\" These guys never miss a note and they make this a most passionate ballad. The music fits in perfectly with the vocals and the band makes this catchy and memorable at once. It brings back good memories, too.\n\nI highly recommend \"See You in September\" by The Happenings. This is The Happenings at their very best!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"When it has came down to Michelle Williams, she has showcased her music more in the gospel pop anthems, rather than trying to stay as a mainstay into the pop world. She showed some songs well, but others have not really sounded as strong as was her days when she was a part of Destiny's Child. Her latest solo attempt is sort of a Destiny's Child reunion, teaming up with Beyonce' Knowles and Kelly Rowland on the song Say Yes. I really didn't find the song to deliver with gospel hearts in the way other songs have like Erica Cambell's solo song Help, or the way that others have delivered like Kirk Franklin showed in so many songs like I Smile. While it isn't a bad song for Michelle, it absolutely isn't one of her best to download. If you've loved her work with Destiny's Child, you'll like this song, but just say no to this one otherwise.\n\nSong: C 1\/2-","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"I grew up in a house listening to almost any kind of music you can think of for various reasons. One being that there is an age divide between me,my 11month younger brother AND my 2 older brothers by 10 years. WE owe it to the USA NAVY, as my Dad was in the Navy for 23 years and out to seas across the world. Well anyway I think one of the only music genres I am lacking but slowly but slowly ,catching up is Classical Music in ALL forms. We did not have that in my home cause it was Motown for me, \"do whoop\" for my older brothers, then Broadway for me...and my Dad & Mom..they were the first to give me the sound of beautiful music and that was with the Big Band Era,the Blues,Peggy Lee,Ella & my fav Pearl Bailey...so we had history of music in my family and when it came to meld this in one house..you should have been there...one floor playing the Shirelles, one floor playing James Brown,Respect by Aretha, then my parents were listening to Peggy Lee or The Andrew Sisters....it was a very musical house...BUT no classical...so last year I decided to start and I did it with subscriptions to ABT(The AMerican Ballet) and to the MET for Opera....HOLY COW I was really missing allot in my life...but now I have the time to really \"digest\" all the new music in my life...and this collection, as soon as you put it on..I hear myself saying...THEY DO NOT WRITE MUSIC LIKE THIS ANYMORE...but I did look up his BIO and he was born with a gift that strangely my friend across the street had the same exact gift. My friend at 3 years old, he sat in front of a toy piano & you say a song and if he had heard it ONCE, he knew it(never in his life taken one lesson and can also play a major Cathedral Organ like St Patrick's Cathedral ..he sat down & knew how to play...I was there)....well the difference is he was not as popular as Mozart in later years...he has also written music but memories of sitting around his baby grand, when we grew up in our Teens ,was always to take a walk across the street to my friend's bedroom where the piano was...was a very special time in my life....\n\nOK some songs did not download and in no way do I crucify Mozart\/Amazon...THEY WILL GIVE IT TO YOU, just send off an email\n\nCheers..\n\nTony(NYC)","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"'Spider-man : Turn Off The Dark's CD release by Broadway musical cast is composed under the direction of Bono & The Edge (U2 frontman\/singer-songwriter & guitarist respectively). It's produced by legendary Steve Lillywhite. This CD (14 tracks) has some highs & lows despite what one could call 'heavyweight production' (Bono, The Edge & the legendary rock producer Steve Lillywhite). There is a great U2 sound in \"NY Debut(Instrumental)\" (great guitar & orchestral sound. The first part of the song is reminiscent of U2's \"Pride(In The Name Of Love)\" sound), \"Boy Falls From The Sky\" (great guitar, featuring Reeve Carney) & \"Picture This\" (great melody & vocals by Bono). Stand-out track is \"Turn Off The Dark\" : well fitting closing title track, wonderful jazz piano & melody featuring T.V.Carpio. Great tracks include \"Rise Above 1\" (melody & vocals featuring Reeve Carney), \"I Just Can't Walk Away(Say It Now)\" (great music & vocals featuring Reeve Carney), \"No More\", \"DIY World\" (great harmonies on this 'cabaret' song featuring Patrick Page), \"If The World Should End\" (jazz track with great violin\/piano\/guitar combination featuring Jennifer Damiano) & \"A Freak Like Me Need Company\". Okay tracks include \"Bouncing Off The Walls\", \"Pull The Trigger\" (indie track with some 'rapping' vocals featuring Patrick Page), \"Sinistereo\" (featuring The Edge) & \"Rise Above 2\". I'm a U2 fan, my expectation may have been very high for this CD. Writing songs for Broadway can be challenging at several levels especially trying to fit into the theme as well as the specific part\/s. And one can appreciate the music more after watching the Broadway musical (was launched yesterday despite some controversies including the firing of a director). On overall, this is a good CD release (but not great or fantastic) from Broaday musical 'Spider-man : Turn Off The Dark', a recommended CD listening & a must for Spider-man & U2 fans.","classification":4,"fold":5}

I find it more polished, (by that I mean a more mature and well thought out record) than their first. For vinyl lovers, we get clear vinyl and for all lovers of great music, we get much better sonics on \"Beneath The Skin\". (While I really liked \"My Head Is An Animal\", it didn't see a lot of playing time on my TT because of the sonics, which I found to be grating).\n\nThere's something about OMAM that has always reminded me of Sinead O'Connor in that I feel a positive sense of urgency along with a certain intensity this music brings in that same positive manner. I'm saying that after listening to (BTS), I want to go out and conquer the world or at the very least do very good things for my fellow man.  I find it to be most enjoyable and I'm left wanting more!\n\nAs of now, for my top picks in 2015, this lp and Death Cab's \"Kintsugi\" are my two favorites for music and sonics.\n\nArtist 5 stars\nContent 5 stars\nSonics 4.75 stars","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Blowing off enough steam to trounce a dozen Don Juan wanna-be's - Alicia Bridges power punches her way through the classic 'disco dancing' ballad \"I Love The Nightlife\"; with no more than an original set of vocals, wildly emotive inflections & intonations (that easily set fire to the 'serious self-stature' themes in the song), a dizzying display of 'unrelenting feminine' provocativeness, and commanding control of her deeply emotional crescendos.\n\nWe take in her message to unfaithful boyfriends, how they line up in her perception of romance, and how she deals with their galavanting all over town - thinking she would stay home and stitch their socks. More couples danced way into the night in wild excitement with this one song - than anyone could imagine - from Moscow to Manhattan - from Paris to Omaha. There is so much life, vigor, and honesty in this song with the trumpets blaring their triumphant salute to her 'stand your ground if he messes around' anthem for women throughout the world. A truly remarkable accomplishment for the artists involved. Written by Bridges and Susan Hutcheson; produced by Steve Buckingham.\n\n\"Please don't talk about love tonight.\nYour sweet talking won't make it right.\nLove and lies just bring me down\nwhen you've got women all over town.\nYou can love them all and when you're through,\nmaybe that'll make, huh, a man out of you.\nI got to go where the people dance.\nI want some action ... I want to live!\n\nAction ... I got so much to give.\nI want to give it. I want to get some too.\n\nOh, I ... Ohhh I ...

{"text":"Bobby Vee was a pop singer from Fargo, ND.  Bobby formed a group called The Shadows with his brother and a friend in 1959.  After Buddy Holly's death in a plane crash on 2\/3\/59 (a\/k\/a \"The Day The Music Died\") it was The Shadows who filled in on Buddy's next scheduled show in Fargo. On Bobby's debut single later on in 1959 the artist was listed as Bobby Vee and the Shadows. All future releases listed Bobby Vee as a solo act.  During the first half of the 1960's singles by Bobby Vee were a fixture on the Billboard Hot 100 pop charts and on Top 40 radio.  Who can forget pop classics like \"The Night Has A Thousand Eyes\", \"Run To Him\", \"Rubber Ball\" and \"Take Good Care of My Baby\" to name but a few.  With the emergence of the British Invasion Bobby Vee's popularity would wane in the mid 1960's.  Then in 1967 Bobby Vee would make one final splash on the pop charts with his comeback hit \"Come Back When You Grow Up\".  The song would spend an impressive 16 weeks on the charts and peak at #3 in September of 1967.  Nice tune!","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"I've been listening to Whitechapel for 3 or 4 years now. I got started with the \"Possession\" video and have been a fan ever since. I picked up This Is Exile and really enjoyed it for a while. I really love a few of the songs on the album but many of the tracks gathered dust in my collection. Then came A New Era Of Corruption...and while this album does have a few stand out tracks, on the whole the album sounds a bit rushed. Maybe rushed isn't the right word but it almost sounds like there wasn't enough time to really work on the sound that defines this band. If you're a fan of Whitechapel then you'll know what I mean by that and why I can't really describe it other than to say...that Whitechapel sound. While there are so many bands emerging in the death metal\/deathcore world now I truly feel that Whitechapel stands out as one of the best. I've been a fan of these genres for over 20 years and it really takes something special to stand out in my ears. Nile, Cannibal Corpse, and Messhugah always impress me with their new albums and now Whitechapel has done it. Their self-titled album Whitechapel is quite simply amazing! There is not a single track I can criticize on this album. I have listened to this album from beginning to end countless times and will continue to do so until their next album comes out. There are so many words that one can use to describe the songs on this album...slamming, thrashy, many-times technical, always brutal, and always Whitechapel. I feel that this band has fully defined itself here and has actually created a sound that can only be called Whitechapel. This album takes the best of their previous releases and throws it all in your face in one 10-song package. The only complaint I have about this album is that I wish there were 5 or 10 more tracks on it with this kind of intensity. Each song leaves you waiting for the next one and the last track leaves you hanging like the twist at the end of a great horror or suspense movie when you find yourself saying, \"Is that really the end? It's too good to end there. I want to see what happens next!\" Pick this up...you will not regret it.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I've kind of got mixed feelings about the Pistol Annies' powerhouse debut, HELL ON HEELS. Yes, this is an incredibly strong release, full of killer harmonies, smart songs and lively arrangements.\n  However, I can't help but feel that the disc also cribbed a lot of it's best material away from co-founder Miranda Lambert's latest solo effort FOUR THE RECORD, resulting in her weakest release to date. As much as I love the Annies, this is something I do NOT want to see happen again.\n  But let's start off by talking about those harmonies! While Lambert is definitely the heart and soul of both the group and the disc, co-founders Ashley Monroe and Angaleena Presley more than hold their own. (Monroe, in particular, is a revelation, often sounding like a young Dolly).\n  Things kick off (no pun intended!) with the sultry title track. This tale of female empowerment (and maybe just a LITTLE bit of gold digging!) has it all...a hypnotic arrangement, sharp lyrics (\"I done made the devil a deal\/He made me pretty\/He made me smart\/And I'm gonna break me a million hearts\"), tons of attitude. But it's the vocals that really shine...each lady stands out, but they also manage to blend beautifully together. A nice way to get things going.\n  Presley takes center stage on \"Lemon Drop.\" There's a whistful quality to both the song and her vocal that both tugs at your heartstrings AND has you rooting for her, all at the same time. Toss in little extras like Lambert's whistle, the sweet lyrics (\"My life is like a lemon drop\/I'm sucking on the bitter to get to the sweet part\") and the closing \"Thaaaank God!\", and you have a track that's an absolute joy!\n  The same can be said about \"Beige\", one of my absolute favorite cuts off of HOH. There's no denying that there's a forlorn quality to the song, but in it's saddness comes a stunning beauty. There's just such a real, honest, organic vibe going on....I don't know if the track is powerful in it's simplicity or simple in it's power, but it works....boiy, does it work! And Monroe's lead vocal? WOW!!!\n  \"Bad Example\" is fun enough, what with it's toe-tapping groove and wink-and-a-nudge lyrics, but the girls will have to be careful in the future....Lambert has danced across this musical floor often enough in the past...they don't want to tread the same territory too frequently. Still, a fun little stomp!\n  I'm not a big fan of \"The Housewife's Prayer\"....I'm sure there are some women ~ and men! ~ who feel this way (\"I've been thinking about all these pills I'm taking\/I wash them down with an ice cold beer\/And the love I ain't been making\"), but what about all of those women who didn't? Women (like my Mom) who soldiered on, knowing this is what they wanted, knowing this is what they signed on for,  knowing there would be ups and downs. I don't know, maybe I'm reading too much into the song, but there's just something....disrespectful....about the track for me. (The downbeat arrangement doesn't help any either!). By far, my least favorite track off of the disc.\n  \"Takin' Pills\" is a total country rave-up...with it's energetic arrangement and spirited vocals, this is often what's called \"good time music.\" But it's the lyrics that really bring it on home....lines like \"She's got a Tennessee mountain point of view\/If you're gonna have one, might as well have two\" and \"No filter on her mouth or her cigarette\" just pop! Love, love, LOVE this song! One of HELL ON HEELS' best moments!\n  There's nothing terribly profound about \"Boys From The South\"....back in the 60's and 70's, this would have been considered a nice \"album track.\"  The arrangement and instrumentation is relaxed and evenly paced ~ sort of like a Summer night on the back porch ~ while Lambert's lead vocal is dreamy, coy and assured, all at the same time. Yep, nothing special, but a nice little album track!\n  The same can be said about \"The Hunter's Wife\"....is it deep? No. Is it songwriting at it's best? No. Is it fun? Without a doubt! Presley's lively vocal skates over the animated lyrics, resulting in an almost giddy groove. Proof positive that sometimes \"fun\" is much more important than \"profound!\"\n  \"Trailer For Rent\" is classic Lambert (if there can be such a thing after less than ten years in the business!)....the cut could have easily fit on any of her solo discs (particularly KEROSENE).Great instrumentation, great vocal, great lyrics..it's got it all! But the song's TRUE power lies in it's overall vibe...that feeling you get of wanting to be on this gal's side, to really have her back....or be sad for her....or help her torch the place! In other words, it touches you...and that's all you can expect music to do. VERY nice.\n  Things wrap up with another favorite of mine, the stinging \"Family Feud.\" Poppy and peppy on the surface, you don't have to dig down too deep to hit the anger, frustration and resentment. Each of the ladies once again shine on their respective lead vocals on the verses, coming together in pitch perfect harmony for the choruses. Another stellar moment!\n  And I can't help but believe that there are plenty more of those moments to come. Much like the members of, say, Fleetwood Mac, each of the members of the Pistol Annies is an amazing artist in her own right who just gets better when combined with the other members, resulting in something magical. Here's hoping that that magic doesn't take away from their individual solo careers, but that it does result in more moments like HELL ON HEELS! (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics).","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Some of the greatest music today is being written for movies and this album showcases 12 wonderful themes.\n\nJackie Evancho shows that her artistry is growing by leaps and bounds. Coupled with her gorgeous soprano voice and her innate ability to discover and evoke the emotional content of the songs, she makes them her own. Some were orginally recorded more than 50 years before she was born and some much more recently, but, in her hands, each is made new again.\n\nEven light fare, such as the themes from Disney movies, Reflection (Mulan), Can You Feel the Love Tonight (The Lion King), and I See the Light (Tangled), become songs with profound messages when Jackie applies her talents to them.\n\nThe orchestrations are extremely well done and support rather than drown her out. Guest artists, Chris Botti, Joshua Bell, and the 2Cellos add wonderful individual, supporting performances to The Summer Knows, My Heart Will Go On, and Se (Cinema Paradiso).\n\nThe duet of Come What May (Moulan Rouge) with The Tenors is an awesome blend of voices, and the performance of I See the Light with her brother, Jacob Evancho, again gives her a chance to show her ability harmonize as well as sing lead.\n\nHer performances of Music of the Night and My Heart Will Go On are, by themselves, reason enough to buy the entire CD.\n\nI was amazed and delighted by this follow up album. Who would think that her incredible, full length debut album, Dream With Me, released last year, would just be a prelude to introduce us to the beauty yet to come? Exquisite!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Instant Classic.  Robert Plant has had a long storied career and could be sailing into his golden years, resting on his laurels. Instead he continues to push his boundries as an artist and has come up with a work that can stand with his work with Led Zeppelin so may decades ago.\n\nPlant has always looked to other cultures for inspiration over he years, be it the blues, early rock 'n roll, North African music, folk (both English and American) and even country.  Here he creates a smoothie of all of these influeces that works on a high level.  Mixing electronics and exotic acoustic instruments, Plant and his fine group of instrumental associates create new hybrids that take the songs to exiting places.  The opening LITTLE MAGGIE,  a traditional tune, adds African stringed instruments and an off kilter electronic rhythm to elevate it from just a mere roots reworking.  The closing Abaden (Maggie's Baby) sounds like prime Massive Attack.  The beautifully sung HOUSE OF LOVE sounds on the surface like a lost tune from the Byrds, until you notice the tribal drums, droning bridge and keening keyboard harmonies.  The etheral POCKETFULL OF GOLDEN even tips a hand towards Plants legenday band's song THANK YOU with it's opening line \"And if the sun refused to shine\".  TURN IT UP, one of the loudest tracks here, sounds like a U2 of acHTUNG BABY! vintage and Led Zeppelin jam session.\n\nZeppelin die hards may resist this as it comes nowhere near the fire and brimsote of the bands classic rock, and Plant's vocals no longer have the edgy piercing tone of a dive bombing plane, but if you take a sip, you can taste various elements of that bands classic catalog.  One cup of GALLOW'S POLE here, a pinch of KASHMIR there, a taste of  ALL OF MY LOVE and an echo of WHEN THE LEVEE BREAKS thundering bottom.  Overall this is a collection that plays strongly as a whole and is both fresh sounding and timeless.  This is a true testiment to the genius of Robert Plant and the collection of desperate, but talented musicians who fear no boundries in the making of transcendant music.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"With a title like \"Fast Car,\" one would probably expect an upbeat, blood-pounding song in the vein of \"Shut Up and Drive\" or even \"Life Is a Highway.\"  One certainly wouldn't expect a poignant, even melancholy ballad about escaping the drudgery of life... only to find oneself back where they started in the end.  And when I stopped and listened to the lyrics I was shocked at just how sad this song was... and yet was captivated by the unflinching portrait Tracy Chapman had painted of a young woman seeking the trap of her old life but finding herself reliving it anyhow.\n\nIt's not a happy song... yet Tracy Chapman sings it so beautifully.  Her wistful voice is never overwrought or melodramatic, conveying just the right amount of emotion to fit the theme of the song.  And the simple instrumentation keeps the song appropriately low-key.  Sometimes a beautiful song is spoiled by being overproduced or oversung, and it was nice to see the singer and producers resist that temptation here.\n\nWhile a melancholy song, \"Fast Car\" is still lovely to listen to, and certainly more thoughtful than the endless parade of love songs that make up popular music nowadays.  If you like James Taylor, you might also enjoy \"Fast Car.\"","classification":5,"fold":5}

They're kind of different, and they grab your attention. They're not stunning in the least bit, but it's different. And some might consider the song a nice change. However, wiser heads would look at the song and say, yeah, it's alright.\n\nOverall, the song doesn't break much ground, and seems in the mold of a thousand before.

{"text":"How can you not like this song?  Okay, it's borderline satanic, but other than that though?  To be honest I think \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\" has gotten a bum rap.  I don't think it's satanic at all.  In fact, I think most critics read too much into the lyrics.  Perhaps the narrator was simply waxing poetic.\n\nRegardless, it's a fun track that rocks like an old school record.  Crank it up and shake a tailfeather.

I actually went to Rat Pak records, after receiving an e-mail ad, and got the CD that comes with a bonus disc of 8 tracks, 5 of which are new songs, including the re-recording of Badlands, which is killer, as well.  This album is totally 5 stars and probably 9 out of 10, if I could rate it on a 10 scale.  I would bet any Metal Fan would love this release.  There are at least 7 out of 11 gems on here and a few tracks that are very good on this disc.  The 'Bonus Disc' includes 5 new tracks and a demo and 2 alt. versions of 2 others, and they're all incredibly terrific.  Don't miss this release.  Mike Howe sounds, frankly, better than ever.  I don't know what they're feeding him, but I want to be on that diet!  Great record from one of my all-time favorite bands!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Although there are several greatest hits packages available for Earth Wind & Fire, most notably the Best of EWF Volumes 1 & 2, their Greatest Hits compliation which was released by Columbia Records in 1998 is easily the best one available. Containing most of the band's hits as well as lesser known tracks that are just as strong, Greatest Hits is the perfect introduction to this talented band's music.\n\n Simply put, every track here is top notch with most of them hitting the Top Ten on both the pop singles and black singles charts. The tracks \"Mighty Mighty\", \"Saturday Nite\", and their only #1 pop single \"Shining Star\" are excellent funk songs punctuated by their trademark snappy horn lines. The tracks \"September\", \"Serpentine Fire\", and \"Sing A Song\" are near perfect pop songs with soaring harmonies and melodies that stay in your head immediately upon first listen. Their late-70's hits \"Let's Groove\" and \"Boogie Wonderland\" are very strong disco tracks with the former track aging wonderfully compared to most of the music from that genre. While the harmonies are strong on all of their material, harmonizing doesn't get much better than on \"Getaway\", arguably the finest song they've ever recorded. The ballads here are all fantastic with \"After The Love Has Gone\", \"That's The Way Of The World\", and \"Reasons\" being not only among the best recorded in the '70s, but of any era. Other great tracks here include their cover of the Beatles' \"Got To Get You Into My Life\", \"Fantasy\", and \"Kalimba's Story.\" This is a phenomenal greatest hits album that should be part of every music fan's collection. Highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Prime Cuts:  Little Wood Guitar, City of Silver Dreams, Nuttin' for Christmas\n\nChristmas CDs are a knotty affair:  almost every successful artist is mandated to release one yuletide offering nowadays whether or not the set is birthed from the heart.  With 5 number 1 hits, 3 multi-platinum albums, and a prime time TV special, success certainly has been a close relative of Sugarland.  And like many country superstars, they have been lobbied by their record company to cut a seasonal effort as a stop-gap album in lieu of a brand new studio CD this year.  Yet, this duo has not treated this as a contractual CD.  Rather, on this hybrid effort, they have invested 5 original tunes, some of which are among their most heartfelt compositions.  Even when they tackle the seasonal chestnuts, they have endorsed their interpretations with innovative creativity.  Bursting the seams of genre classifications, these 10 cuts are made so much more interesting with doses of r & b, jazz, pop, country rock as well as even some traces of bluegrass.\n\nThe set's opener \"City of Silver Dreams\" is an instant heart grabber--a polished country pop ballad about a wide-eyed country girl's first Christmas in the urban jungle of New York City.  Jennifer Nettles' heartfelt delivery emotes in convincing ways the loneliness of being homesick that truly staggers the heart.  \"Little Wood Guitar,\" written by Ellis Paul and Kristian Bush, is a finely honed narrative piece telling the story of how a girl's life changed since she received a guitar as her only gift one Christmas.  Yet not is syrupy sentimental; Sugarland shows that they know how to have fun with \"Nuttin' for Christmas.\"  Cute, fun, and definitely catchy--Nettles truly sounds like she's having fun and easily \"Nuttin' for Christmas\" would rock well in the ranks of classics such as \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\" and \"Jingle Bells.\"  However, not all the originals are of that lofty in standard:  \"Maybe Baby\" sounds like a track from their standard album with \"Christmasy\" references tagged on.  While \"Coming Home\" is pretty average this time finding the duo in r&b territory with a light touch of Gospel.\n\nAs for the seasonal favourites, Sugarland does step out of the tried and tested box.  This duo gives \"Winter Wonderland\" a country boogie makeover that is infectious.  While most renditions of \"O Come O Come Emanuel\" are dirge-like slow, Sugarland offers a bluegrassy take of this hymn making it sound like a rootsy Southern Gospel revival number.  Never to be restrained by the language barrier, \"Silent Night\" is sung bilingually in both English and Spanish.  This time \"Silent Night\" finds Jennifer Nettles trading lines with Kristian Bush making one wish they would sing more duets together.  Kristian Bush again returns to the microphone to sing lead on \"Holly Jolly Christmas\" which is quite jovial without being exceptional.\n\nRelative to most Christmas CDs out there, \"Gold and Green\" shows personality.  More than just a holiday album, this is very much a Sugarland record.  They have left their patented mark all over.  Even the traditional old favourites have been re-vamped.  However, like their studio albums, with the originals coming mostly from their own pens, some of them become pretty average pop country efforts.  Other than that, \"Gold and Green\" is much more than your average sonic ornament.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"The Beatles' dizzying pace continues with their fifth UK album in two short years. [It was their ninth U.S. album!] Unlike the previous BEATLES FOR SALE, this album contains only two covers:  the Larry Williams rocker \"Dizzy Miss Lizzie\" and the song Buck Owens had a country hit with \"Act Naturally\" sung by Lennon and Ringo respectively.  These covers and the other five tracks the cromprise the second half of this album were not used in the movie. However, it includes what is probably the most universally recognized song in the Beatles' catalog, McCartney's lovely ballad \"Yesterday.\"\nLennon's soul-searching songs like the title track and especially \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\" clearly show the influence Dylan was having on his songwriting.  Harrison also gets a couple of his songs onto the album:  The lovely \"I Need You\" and the infectious \"You Like Me Too Much.\" McCartney also offers the standout tracks \"The Night Before\" and \"Another Girl.\"\nWhile not as good as the two albums to follow, this is nonetheless a terrific album in its own right.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Forget everything you knew about Coldplay, \"Speed of Sound,\" \"Clocks,\" all have been turned upside-down in amazing and glorious fashion. Coldplay drops their trademark sound for something completely different, and the world of music might never be the same again.\n\nThe sound is possibly indie, definitely something out of the U.K., and certainly something new we've never heard before. It's surreal, it's art, it's a new breed of rock. The lyrics are not as cryptic as previous efforts, but still not a spelled out song, with the only chorus making a shred of sense, \"If you love me, won't you let me know?\" A haunting picture is painted of winter, and the song certainly paints and fits the mood.\n\nChris Martin never sounded better vocally, and they go perfectly with the song. As for catchiness, I don't think this is one you'll be singing in the grocery store, but you'll remember the general feel of the song.\nAs for negatives, there isn't any. Take the song, or leave it. It certainly won't appeal to everyone.\n\nOverall, not the first thing you'd think of when it comes to summer music, but I see a world in which this song becomes a big hit. Certainly over the pond. The song is a haunting painting of ole', with originality, and the element that really makes the song, the mood. You might not find another thing like it, and you're certainly not going to confuse it with something else. Let more U2 comparisons come in, they're as good, and should be as successful. Take it or leave it, Coldplay never ceases to amaze.","classification":5,"fold":5}

The song is a look at a Vietnam vet who returns home to find that his country has forgotten all about him.  The song's dark lyrics are masked by a stirring, anthemic backing track that embodied a patriotic sound that caused confusion over the real meaning of the song.  All the misunderstanding aside, the song is both pro and anti America.  It takes on the yin and yang that is this country by on one hand, celebrating the majestic and glory of the flag and then the dark underbelly where we send the less fortunate to keep them out of sight.  It is a perfect song and one of, if not, the greatest single of all time.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Nickelback churn out release after release of poor derived pop rock dribble. There is nothing new from the band, no new angle, no change. It's precisely the same monotonous punchy chord guitar playing, grainy whiney vocals and horribly clichd lyrics that featured on previous albums.\n\nWhat makes Nickelback all the more insulting is the undeserved popularity. I was over in Canada a little while ago and on one of their rock stations a poll took place, their `rock world cup', this match up was Nickelback vs Pearl Jam, and you guessed it, Nickelback stormed it. Such an insult to Pearl Jam, an original band that Nickelback completely rip the sh*t off.\n\nQuite simply Nickelback's music is mediocre, there's nothing worth listening to. Do yourself a favour and listen to some original guitar driven rock, par example `Soundgarden', `Alice In Chains' or `Pearl Jam'.","classification":1,"fold":5}

{"text":"I confess that I haven't heard the original Vicki Lawrence version of this song -- indeed, I didn't even know this song was a remake until I looked it up out of curiosity.  So I have no idea how Reba McEntire's version compares to Lawrence's.  Normally I prefer the original version of a song over a remake (unless it's a Weird Al \"remake\"), and I suppose one of these days I should look up the Lawrence version as a comparison\/contrast to McEntire's.\n\nBut as of now, this version of \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\" is one of my favorite songs of all time.  It's a dark ballad with a complex but compelling storyline, and a surprisingly shocking ending.\n\nThe song is played in an eerie, almost menacing key, quite befitting the building dread of the story as a man tries to track down his unfaithful wife's lover and gets far more trouble than he bargained for in the process.  The piano and electric guitar track mesh well, and the drum track is appropriately intense without overpowering the song.  And Reba's vocals carry the song well -- she doesn't scream or holler, but lets the lyrics convey the song's emotions on their own.  This song could easily have played out as melodramatic in the hands of another singer, but Reba doesn't overdo it, and so the song hits the right balance.\n\nBy now I'm sure the song's twist ending is well-known, but it can still be shocking to first-time listeners.  I won't spoil it further.\n\nOne of Reba's best songs, and one of the best country songs I've heard.  If you don't mind your music dark and with a complex storyline, give this a listen.","classification":5,"fold":5}

If anything, \"Breakfast At Tiffany's\" (the song) was a mainstay of my childhood, a nostalgic hit that reminds me of a less complicated time of my life and brings back fond memories.  And while the song is ostensibly about a couple on the verge of breaking up and struggling to find something in common (with both of them liking the titular film being the only common ground they seem to have), the song itself is surprisingly upbeat and warm.\n\nI may not know anything else Deep Blue Something has released, and I still need to watch \"Breakfast At Tiffany's\" (the movie) at some point in my life.  But in the meantime, this song still evokes strong memories of my childhood and early teens, and for that I love it.","classification":5,"fold":5}
{"text":"KISS is a rock n roll band. In the 1970-80s era, they embodied an aspect of rock alongside the Who, the Stones and the others. Most of their music is high testosterone, like \"Strutter,\" \"Hard Luck Woman,\" and \"I Was Made for Loving You,\" bordering on self-parody. They were and are fun.\n\nThen there's \"Beth.\" It is a quiet song, but is gritty in its message. It isn't a metal ballad, but could have just easily been performed by Bread. There is depth, passion, and love. It is poetic, melodic, and, in my opinion, has earned its spot as one of rock music's greatest songs.\n\nIf the rest of KISS' songwriting was on par with \"Beth,\" KISS could've been more than a fun band stuck its era, but had a legacy to last until the end of rock n roll.\n\nIt begins:\n\nBeth, I hear you callin'\nBut I can't come home right now\nMe and the boys are playin'\nAnd we just can't find the sound\n\nIt ends:\nBeth, I know you're lonely\nAnd I hope you'll be alright\n'Cause me and the boys will be playin'\nAll night\n\nLook, if you are reading this review, you already know the song.

{"text":"Strange enough, you don't hear many songs on rock radio, that actually know how to rock. \"Psycho\" however rocks the house down with its almost Nirvana alt hard rockin'. Nope, this song isn't afraid to let out a yell or two, or three, but their not screaming through the whole song either. Nope, it's a perfect blend sure to please a real rock radio listener.\n\nThe verses work very nicely, and keep the song moving toward the main show of the chorus. And the chorus really rocks. Sure, it might be a little too familiar for rock radio in its short burst of the 1st round, but it saves all its energy for the rest of the song, when it brings the house down with its catchy and infectious energy that sounds right out of the 90's.\n\nOverall, with its loaded gun of energy, and familiar, but still rockin' elements driving it, if you listen to rock radio, you're going to love it. This song really took me back to that 90's alt rock movement with bands like Collective Soul and Nirvana, and \"Psycho\" certainly does the greats justice.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Seriously what can I say, Iron Maiden are simply one of my favorite metal bands ever. I've even had the pleasure of seeing them live down in Cadott at Rock Fest on their Maiden England North American Tour in July of last year, and they were just flat out amazing live, I felt my breath was literally taken away. These guys have always brought so much to their table other than just catchy, killer rock\/metal anthems, they've brought sheer epicness, brilliantly complexed musicianship, and masterful songwriting and lyrics dealing with History, Literature, Mythology, War, Space, and Fantasy, and \"Somewhere in Time\" proves all of that. This album is truly one of Iron Maiden's best releases, it is simply a true juggernaut of a classic album in all seriousness. \"Somewhere in Time\" also introduces the use of guitar synthesizers as well, giving the album a strong progressive feel and atmosphere especially in the opening title track and \"Heaven Can Wait\", and among other tracks on here. Everything that all fans of Maiden cherish and love is definitely all on here. Bruce Dickinson's vocals as always soar so high and mighty, and dueling guitarists Adrian Smith and Dave Murray both dazzle and delight with their incredible riffs and solos. Bassist Steve Harris as usual shines throughout with his incredible bass lines that are almost strong enough to crush your ribcage, and drummer Nicko McBrain shows his awesome talents behind the kit as always. Every song on here is a masterpiece, so there's really no skipping required here.\n\nThe opening track \"Caught Somewhere in Time\" is an excellent fast 7 minute piece of pure Maiden Madness. The intro is just infectious and pure bliss. The second track \"Wasted Years\" is another one of Maiden's best known songs. This song is filled with more great riffs throughout including a killer opening riff, and the chorus is also very memorable, plus the solo section is just pure bliss as well. Track three \"Sea of Madness\" is no doubt the heaviest song on the album which is highlighted by dominating guitars, hard pounding drums and bass lines, and soaring vocals from Bruce especially in the chorus, while \"Heaven Can Wait\" is an excellent, catchy sing along number with a great bass intro, along with more amazing vocals and guitar work, and of course a catchy middle choral section that you just can't resist singing along to. Next, we have \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\" which is another awesome fast galloper featuring fast hammering drum beats from Nicko. \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" is probably the album's best song in my opinion. The guitar solo always sends chills down my spine every time I hear it, just listen to it for yourself. \"Deja Vu\" is a great melodic, yet fast paced number, and of course \"Alexander the Great\" is an amazingly masterful 8 minute epic closer that will take your breath away. As I mentioned earlier, each song on here is a masterpiece, there is not one single bad song on here whatsoever.\n\nOverall, \"Somewhere in Time\" is another classic juggernaut of pure Maiden Madness from beginning to end. If you're already a fan of Iron Maiden, then by all means this masterpiece is definitely for you...\n\nUP THE IRONS!!!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"This is a beautifully packaged set. I chose the Lp's because visually the thing is siply stunning. A whole lot has been written about the consistency of the sound and it is true: tehre are recordings from the early 80's when the band was in its prime that really hold up to the rest. The approach taken was to assemble a set with some of the best songs Petty has produced over  the last 4 decades. It is clear that it can never contain all the songs everyone would want. however since it starts with my favourite \"Nightwatcher\", I personanly cannot complain. Then on the same disc there is also \"I need to know\". Both these are rfom what I consider Petty's best period. I had personally lost Petty from view I would say in the 90's because I found he had lost some of the bite that his first 5 records contained. This live set serves as a reappraisal even for me because the consistency of the songs is incredible. I used to think he had kind of lost it after Free Fallin' especially when he started doing the Travelling Wiburys. Anyway here we get to hear what a spectacular band he and the Heartbreakers were and are. The sound is also incredible if zou consider the age of some of the recordings. There is also a very well done booklet that gives you some personal glimpses into the babd's career as well as some informatio on the restoring process involved. Even if it is not cheap it is a wonderful box set.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"There's no getting around it. Most of those who will be curious about this album miss the full-fledged Ben& Tracey team of Everything But The Girl. But EBTG certainly had a lot of different flavors to it. My favorite period was their last, the electronic\/house period -- the final three albums. Much of their earlier work was more intimate, spare, maybe more personal in a way.\n\nMost of the material on Tracey's Love and Its Opposite probably compare to that early work. It's softer, less beat-oriented. There is a dance song here, as I recall. And Kentish Town -- not a dance piece by any means -- still has a hypnotic rhythm. It's probably my favorite song on the album. A bit dark, mysterious, ethereal.\n\nSo, if you like the spare and acoustic EBTG, you'll probably enjoy this album more than I did. I'm not a good judge of lyrics, so I won't comment on them, except to say they didn't sound bad or clunky. I focused on the music. Though it was pretty, I can't say the songs really grabbed me. I did enjoy Kentish Town and Swimming most of all. Perhaps I'm not in the situation in my life to appreciate the topical subject matter.\n\nI hope some day we can see another group effort. Until then, this album should satisfy at least part of the EBTG fan base.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Most-Relaxing-Classical-Music-in-the-Universe\/dp\/B005GLRTPM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Most Relaxing Classical Music in the Universe<\/a>&nbsp;is one of many MP3 classical music compilations being featured on the site.  The clicking noise that was formerly audible in the background of most of the tracks has indeed been removed from the MP3s.  It still  has not been repaired in the sample tracks.  But I was curious enough to download it anyway, and the tracks have indeed been fixed.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\nI own a large library of classical music.  There are two primary reasons to purchase a compilation like this.  It can either be used an introduction to a variety of classical music or out of the laziness of not wanting to make it yourself by picking the more relaxing movements from your collection.  I gave in for the second reason.  The music is excellently selected.  It's always nice to listen to complete works in their entirety.  But sometimes it is nice to have a relaxing playlist that won't surprise you with the occasional loud or fast movement.  Then again, this compilation does have a few that could fit that category, such as \"Sylvia\" which is track 11 on disk 2.\n\nFor some reason, half the tracks list the performers and the other half list the composers.  Here are the composers for all.\n\nDisk 1\n\nTrack 1 - J.S. Bach\nTrack 2 - Debussy\nTrack 3 - Beethoven\nTrack 4 - Janacek\nTrack 5 - Handel\nTrack 6 - J.S. Bach\nTrack 7 - Saint-Saens\nTrack 8 - Saint-Saens\nTrack 9 - Saint-Saens\nTrack 10 - Paillard\nTrack 11 - Chopin\nTrack 12 - Sibelius\nTrack 13 - Tchaikovsky\nTrack 14 - Mozart\n\nDisk 2\n\nTrack 1 - Brahms\nTrack 2 - Beethoven\nTrack 3 - J.S. Bach\nTrack 4 - Boccherini\nTrack 5 - Johann Strauss II\nTrack 6 - Mozart\nTrack 7 - Mascagni\nTrack 8 - Mussorgsky\nTrack 9 - Tchaikovsky\nTrack 10 - Johann Strauss II\nTrack 11 - Delibes\nTrack 12 - Carl Off\nTrack 13 - Shostakovich\nTrack 14 - Mendelssohn\nTrack 15 - Rimsky-Korsakov\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe performances are good quality and the sound quality is acceptable.  The title is absurd.  But maybe they were going for irony.  Maybe they meant this was the most relaxing classical music in the entire multi-verse.  One or two track changes might be necessary for that claim.\n\nEnjoy.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"When it had came down to Lady Gaga, she had so much in the way of noise with Born This Way, and sadly she didn't actually ignite for awhile, with hip surgery derailing her tour, but she still has thrived with triumph and with sadness, losing her influence last year who inspired her to sing, Whitney Houston. But with Lady Gaga, the question is does she ignite fire with her fans again, the answer is not really. Applause, the lead single from her upcoming third album Artpop is not really anything exciting. It feels like she doesn't thrive in the song, and instead feels like she is robotic to the rhythm. I really didn't find her song to really give it her all in the song. I think for Lady Gaga, she really needs to bring more to the voice into the upcoming record, because if Artpop is going to be another poor record, I will definitely want to boo.\n\nSong: C 1\/2-","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"I've heard it said that when Trent Reznor, who wrote this song and performed it in solo and\/or with Nine Inch Nails, he was very much opposed to Johnny Cash covering this song.  Yet, when Trent heard JC's version, he was truly impressed.  So am I.  This was recorded by Cash just after the death of his wife June Carter Cash, and shortly before he himself died.  I can hear the heartbreak in his voice.  He sounds old and weary, yet that works so well for him in this song.  This was truly his last iconic hit, in my opinion.  I love performing this song at karaoke, since I have a deep voice.  But it is incredibly challenging and difficult to achieve his style.  I've done it before, but it seems only by accident.  Cash is truly a master songwriter and performer, and this track is truly an exclamation mark on his entire repertoire.","classification":5,"fold":5}

But in this case, repetition surprisingly works well in the singer's favor. In his fifth studio album, appropriately titled Chapter V, Trey effortlessly switches from anger to sadness with Heart Attack to dancing and drinking in 2 Reasons (feat. T.I.) [Explicit].\n\nGuest verses from T.I., Jeezy and Lil Wayne aren't that bad either. Even if many can argue that this is not the best album in the R&B genre of the year (there is a lot of competition), it is still a good album that mixes genuine emotion, strong lyrics and catchy beats with definite style and swagger.

{"text":"It's kind of hard to expound on Weezer's classic debut. In the aftermath of grunge and the death of Kurt Cobain, along came four noisy geeks who made the world safe for noisy hook laden songs about loudmouthed girlfriends (\"No One Else\"), the joys of high-school love (\"Buddy Holly\") and a great metaphor about an unraveling relationship (\"Undone - The Sweater Song\"). Along with seven other great songs, this was a first album that yielded some perennial material, and founded the cult that Rivers Coumo rides today.\nSo why should you pony up the extra dough for the \"expanded\" edition? Is the second disc really worth it? For a change, the answer is yes. You get four great live tracks, complete with some funny self depreciating comments, one song from a various artists rarities album that the band wrote about their lawyer (\"Jamie\"), and a handful of demos. The best of the bunch is an a cappella quickie titled \"My Evaline\" that highlights Weezer's uncanny harmony abilities, something occasionally lost in the din.\nIf you're reading this, you're probably already inclined towards buying this. Go ahead. Maybe we'll get lucky and \"Pinkerton\" will get the same royal treatment.","classification":5,"fold":5}

So this is about a 95% discount !!!!! And as seems all too common for these kinds of deals, it has been obfuscated to disguise the value. My guess is that it must be for the purpose of market segmentation between normal shoppers and us bargain hunters. And as also often seems to be the case, pianist Dubravka Tomsic is part of the conspiracy. As far as I can tell, she has absolutely nothing to do with the music on this set. This appears to be entirely the work of Jean-Pierre Armengaud, as indicated by the credits on the individual tracks. The other thing they've done to slightly cloud the issue is to mix up the order of the Etudes, Preludes and Images so they aren't quite as Debussy intended. This can be easily corrected. The sound quality here is gorgeous, with possibly a bit more ambiance than I would normally prefer for piano recordings, but the performances also tend to be on the slow dreamy side compared to what I am used to and prefer for Debussy, so the performances suit the venue. So go ahead and accuse me of nitpicking - this is great !!!!!!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Prime Cuts: Be (My Heart, My Hands, My Voice), Nearing Home, At the Cross\n\nHave you ever bought an entire CD or downloaded an entire album at the impulse of hearing a single off the radio?  You are so enamored by this one song that you hope the single is a prolepsis of more sonic greatness to come.  But after giving the CD five or six spins, save for the lead single, none of songs seem to have any melodic velcrose to stick to your memory bank.  Even after the umpteenth listening, these songs still remain distant, aloof and unrecognizable; they are like complete strangers dearth of any social skills.  This is not the case with Selah's \"You Amaze Us.\"  Todd Smith, Allan Hall and Amy Perry have hospitably eased their latest release with a sense of congeniality, familiarity and cordiality that makes you feel like you are listening to an old friend you have not seen for years.  And each song they sing sounds like a fresh episode of conversational piece you wish it would never end.\n\nPart of the reason why \"You Amaze Us\" has this refreshing familiarity is because Selah has recorded their new tunes conterminously with hymns and familiar worship songs.  In this case, they have included four hymns, namely \"Victory in Jesus,\" \"In the Garden,\" \"I'd Rather Have Jesus\" and \"Just as I Am.\"  But they have not woodenly phoned in their recordings.  Rather, the hymn \"Just as I Am\" not only features Amy Perry's powerhouse melisma but it also shows how Selah has contemporized the hymn by augmenting the hymn with a pre-chorus to it.  Not only are hymns included, but the trio have also included a couple of covers, namely Gateway Worship's \"O the Blood\" and Andre Crouch's \"Soon and Very Soon.\"  With regards to the latter, Todd Smith sings the African-flavored \"Soon and Very Soon\" in both English and Kituba.  Having grown up as a missionary kid in the Congo, \"Soon and Very Soon\" was the song they would sing over and over again whenever life was challenging.\n\nHowever, \"You Amaze Us\" is more than just a nostalgic trip back to the past.  The title cut and lead single \"You Amaze Us\" is a slick pop worship piece that celebrates an array of God's encompassing attributes.  And those who are into triviality may be delighted to know that \"You Amaze Us\" is the only song to ever debut at #1 on Billboard's Christian Soft AC chart since the chart's inception in 2006.  \"Nearing Home,\" which also appears on Allan Smith's brand new solo album, is a treasured gem.  After being invited by Dr. Billy Graham's daughter Anne Graham Lotz to sing at a pastor's retreat, Allan Hall has decided to write a song in honor of Dr. Graham.  Nestled within the homely sounds of fiddle and guitar, this gentle ballad chronicles the legacy of one of America's towering evangelist in ways that are heartfelt and challenging.\n\nA couple of songs were driven by the trio's passion for missions with \"Be (My Heart, My Hands, My Voice)\" being a standout.  While Amy Perry puts her soaring soprano on full display on the power worship ballad \"At the Cross.\"  With a hymn-like structure that could work wonderfully in congregational singing, \"At the Cross\" spells out the heart of the Gospel in its gorgeous splendor without a iota of compromise.  \"You Amaze Us,\" at the end of the day, is an amazing record.  Brimming with a broad range of themes, styles and stories, there is hardly room for any soporific moment.  And with a familiarity that comes with some of the songs, this is an album that will get you worshipping along in no time.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Facedown Records released this sampler in time for their April 8 & 9 Facedown Fest in Pomona, California. According to Wikipedia 'Facedown is a Christian Record Label featuring Christian & Secular Bands'. Many sound pretty good.\n\nTrack 1 Gideon playing Virtue. Cool music behind metal vocal grinding and peaking on this opening track. Nice.\n\nYour Memorial play Surface next. Similar vocal sound to Gideon better harmonies & better sound behind the real singer. Song breaks out into excellent rock track as the singer and band overwhelm the metal vocal. This is a great song.\n\nTrack 3 is My Epic with Lower Still. Neat opening to great song. This is a very cool metal song neat vocal harmonies over 'wall of noise' and some intelligible lyrics.\n\nTranscend by Hope For The Dying. Another song that overcomes the metal vocals and soars featuring nice guitar work great singing drums and sound. 7+ minute track gives you time for mellow and harsh moments. Like it.\n\nTrack 5 is Devastator by For Today. Early neat clean guitar sound over metal vocal descends into metal and metal that is disjointed and raw. Vocals with a obvious message don't help.\n\nMessengers play Anthems next. Starts w\/frantic playing over jerky singer. The track slows and dies along with the singers groaning. Shame.\n\nThe War Within Us from Onward To Olympas. In your face metal vocal partners w\/strong band. Metal vocal was nearly too much for me until soaring singer joins in and competes with that voice. Song wins.\n\nTrack 8 War Of Ages w\/Collapse. Neat opening then metal vocal immediately at war with true singing. Lively band some neat in your face voice great harmonies strong playing, lyrics probably have a message song outweighs all. Great track.\n\nA Hope For Home play The Overman. Nothin' fancy then non metal singer joins in (again). More cool vocal over metal vocal and bashing band. I am detecting a pattern here start with classic metal vocal then bring in cool rock vocalist on some of these tracks.\n\nTrack 10 Empty Promises by Call To Preserve. Classic 2+ minutes of Metal.\n\nThe Hands play 6 minutes of Resistance. Slow lightweight metal over deliberate lyrics. Band wakes up slows down singer keeps speaking. Song restarts at 3 minutes, the second half sounds the same.\n\nOvercome with Alone in a Crowd. Vicious vocal over punchy band becomes drain vocal over same band.\n\nTrack 13 And Weep by A Plea For Purging. More of an intestinal vocal than previous tracks. Active band. Not for me.\n\nNext up Defamator by Take It Back. Fast punkish sound 97 seconds of metal action great song.\n\nIn The Midst Of Lions play The Machine. Nothing special here. Metal vocal same sound.\n\nTrack 16 Burial playing Demons Never Sleep. Could the song title be a warning to us w\/rapid metal playing behind metal vocals sounding the same, perhaps Demons never sleep?\n\nLast track All, But The Archer by Saving Grace. Throat clearing intro by the vocalist leading to more of the same. Band zooms along but can't redeem the track even with weird chorus spoken words and pauses later in the song.\n\nThis is a good sampler. Started better faded at the end. Some neat songs couple of great tracks. From what I could understand much of the content suffers usual tendency of this genre of limited lyrical imagination.

I tried out some\nsongs on \"the previous listen button\" provided by Amazon of this CD and since I\nliked the first 4 songs I decided to buy it. I must say that I was immediately\ncaught by his baritone voice and great songs. There's a lot of Texas shuffle and\nHonky Tonk which happen to be my favorite types of country music. The song that I\nlike most, though, is really the only ballad available on this CD called \"For A\nLittle While\".

{"text":"Cyndi Lauper's \"Detour\" has some great gems.  Her cover of the Wanda Jackson record \"Funnel of Love\" that opens the disc bounces joyfully with Cyndi's voice full of swagger as her band rocks, \"It's such a crazy crazy feeling, weak in the knees as my head goes reeling.\"  I also warm to her covers of two tracks associated with Patsy Cline.  \"Walkin' After Midnight\" has been covered by so many singers from Wanda Jackson to Kellie Pickler to Loretta Lynn.  In Cyndi's hands it has a pulsing beat with Cyndi massaging the melody playfully, \"I walk for miles along the highway, that's just my way of saying 'I love you.'\"  \"I Fall to Pieces\" has been recorded by so many including ex-Monkee Michael Nesmith, Linda Ronstadt, and yes, Loretta Lynn.  Cyndi goes a little deeper into her register to milk the sadness out of the vocals, \"You want me to act like we've never kissed; You want me to forget, pretend we've never met; And I've tried and I've tried, though I haven't yet.\"  Other tracks like \"Misty Blue,\" \"Night Life\" in duet with its most famous singer and songwriter Willie Nelson, and the closer \"Hard Candy Christmas\" also charm.  While not every track here makes me jump for joy, there is enough to warrant strong listening and play.  Enjoy!","classification":4,"fold":5}

Pay $4 to download these, and put the other $5 toward the full Czarface album. Or use them to download DTD, It's What It Is, ENY House, and East MC's from his other albums.\n\nAs an album, I think it's MK's weakest. I have no problem w\/ the fact that he's pursuing a different sound and doesn't have any Wu features. I think MK can stand on his own two feet, and I like his style. He really shines on those 4 tracks I mentioned.\n\nThe problem is that there are only a couple other actual songs, and those didn't do much for me, and once you subtract a couple of skit-type tracks and a few forgettable spoken word tracks, there's really not enough on here to justify calling it an album. Compare to the number of actual songs (i.e., with rap verses) on, say, Wu-Block or, again, Czarface.\n\nI'm saying, if Killa's gonna call this an album and expect my $10 (which he got), he needs to deliver at least 10-15 actual rap songs.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"First off, what is the point of this \"duet?\" Because from my viewpoint it is at best a vehicle for Beyonce, and a god-awful one at that. How bad is this song? In the original version, where the song was treated like art, not a marketing tool, Justin Timberlake gave his best vocal performance yet with a 5-star croon. Here, with the shoving of Timberlake, and the addition of Beyonce, she sounds more like the cat whose tail has just been stepped on. To put it mildly, Beyonce is a horrible singer here, and she ruins a perfectly good song. Also, it's not a \"duet,\" but rather, insert Beyonce over the original track, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nOverall, please don't buy this pathetic excuse for a song. It's one of the flat-out worst quality of song in 2007, Period.","classification":1,"fold":5}

{"text":"There was some initial buzz surrounding the release of this album that went something like this...\"This sounds like Hsker D, could this be Bob's warm-up for the inevitable Hsker reunion?\"\n\nWell...maybe it is, maybe it isn't. This is a prime example of what's wrong with \"rock journalism.\" It can never be about what IS, right NOW. It's always about being the literate and witty Sherlock Holmes that uncovers the artist's ulterior motive, their hidden agenda.\n\nLet me tell you everything you need to know about this album in a couple of words, then I'll get more specific. It's PRIME Bob, he rocks harder than anyone you can name who's half his age, the songs are tight, the performances and production are red hot, and this is basically 38 minutes of sonic napalm packed into a jewel box.\n\nThe opener, \"Star Machine,\" features some signature low-boil chord strumming and laid-back Mould vocals before he steps on the gas at the 45 second mark. It features the well-known ping-ponging of loud \/ quiet dynamics and an excruciatingly hook-laden chorus:\n\n\"You say you want it, you say you need it\nYou say it's everything, never wanna leave it\nThe star machine is coming down on you...\"\n\nAt the 2:16, Bob lets loose with one of his \"fire in the hole\" solos before staggering back into the chorus. This is mighty, mighty music that will put hair on your chest and a spring in your step.\n\nWithout taking a breath, \"Star Machine\" segues directly into the title track, and it features Bob's ongoing quest for the clouds wrapped around life's silver lining:\n\n\"This is how I'm gonna spend my days\nGonna fight, gonna ****, gonna feed\nGonna walk away...\"\n\nI cannot imagine ANY music fan who likes Neil Young & Crazy Horse and the electric, feedback-driven, p*ss*d-off Lou Reed who doesn't also like Bob Mould. I just don't see how that could be possible. He's just as good, just as original, and he's still crazy after all these years. If you've followed the ups and downs of his solo career and found yourself scratching your head over experiments like the electronica of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Modulate\/dp\/B00005YWG0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Modulate<\/a>, this is a triumphant, full-bore return to what Bob does best. The thick, fat, meaty wall of sound that propels \"Steam of Hercules\" is just Bob in the ZONE, calling down the thunder.\n\nThis is late-period Hsker D-style music...when the band dialed back the amphetamine rocket sled speedcore a few notches to make room for melody (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Flip-Your-Wig\/dp\/B000000M0N\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Flip Your Wig<\/a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Candy-Apple-Grey\/dp\/B000005JAK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Candy Apple Grey<\/a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Warehouse-Songs-Stories\/dp\/B000005JAM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Warehouse: Songs & Stories<\/a>). That said, it doesn't have to be anything more than an album of killer Bob songs.\n\nStop reading this review and buy this CD NOW.\n\n:-)","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I'm one of those that really did not give MCR a chance because they were emo or punk or I don't know; I was just judging I admit. Then out of the blue, when this album came out, I just happened to turn to MTV2 and saw the music video for Na Na Na, and it literally blue me away. Not just the song, but the visual style of the music video.\n\nAnd then Sing is an even better song and a better music video.\n\nBut, here's the thing. It's a Post-Apocalyptic concept album--the same with Linkin Park's A Thousand Suns. And they both came out around the same time. It was like when The Prestige and The Illusionist were in theaters. Most people saw The Prestige (A Thousand Suns--and with very mixed results, but I loved it), and not enough people saw the Illusionist (MCR TTLOTFK). It's a shame too many people were fussing about how they hate Linkin Park's experimental career instead of giving MCR a chance. In other words, ATS sort of cast a shadow over MCR since they both had similiar albums and ATS was a little bit more contraversial.\n\nI have listened to Black Parade; it's been in my CD for a while back a year ago. And I can truthfully saw that this album is better (and I have no reason to be bias toward one or the other, but I can say that Linkin Park's ATS may have helped me like this album more).\n\nIf you liked this album, you would probably like Linkin Park's A Thousand Suns, and vice versa.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Poor Cyndi, she'll always be remembered for that song where girls want to have fun, and she didn't even write it. Sad? Not really, she still rakes in the big bucks. But this little song was her crowning jewel, and showed that she just might be a real artist after all... those thoughts quickly faded though. And even though that song is considered underrated, it's been covered this way and that way, from Spoken to Rob Thomas, to a plethora of other artists. However, while all great, none of them take it to this level. Nope, Quietdrive hit gold here. What sad is the fact that this is their biggest song, and they didn't even write it. Ironic, no?\n\nThe first thing that grabs me is the modern feel they add to the song, more pop\/punk ballad, just more updatedness. Then the lyrics will grab you, with those appropriate vocals that don't over do it, but don't under do it either. It's just perfect here. Then the chorus really takes off into a total emotional experience, making the song the band's own, and taking it to new heights.\n\nThe picture I get in my mind when I think of this song, is two lovers holding hands, trying to hang on while on a spinning carousel. Pretty cool image, but that's what this song conveys. The joy and wonderfulness of love a such a great emotional level.\n\nThen the part right after the 2nd chorus just comes to an emotional climax, and if that couldn't get any better, it unleashes it all in the 3rd round of choruses. Pretty awesome and well-done to say the least. Although it probably ends too fast. They could have gone about 30-seconds longer.\n\nSo overall, Quietdrive really puts their heart into this underrated pop\/punk ballad that works in amazing ways to say the least. I just loved hearing it on its few short months on radio. And I'll probably never forget it. It's a wonderful song, and if you loved the original, you should probably check this out.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"This is an epic rock opera. It is not a formula for all future Dream Theater albums, and it should be applauded that they had the guts to create something bigger and more challenging. I give them a lot credit since the risk is much higher in 2016 than it was in the 70s because the internet is a platform for people to destroy a band at lightning speed. With all that being said, you can expect excellent musicianship and vocals in a long concept album wrapper.  I am enjoying this album immensely, and while some may state it is cheesy, I have no issues with the content. How many albums do we need about love, religion, and politics?  Each listen is more and more exciting as it grows on me further. I cannot at this point see my Progressive rock collection without it. Any Dream Theater fan, Progressive Rock or metal fan, should add it to their collection.  It is nothing like the classic Dream Theater albums, so your expectation is what can control your appreciation for The Astonishing.\n\nUPDATE:  12\/24\/2016.  I wrote this review in January, and 11 months later, my opinion has not changed.  The Astonishing is an excellent album and should be in every progressive rock collection.  The main complaints that I hear is that it is not metal enough and it is too long.  To address both of those issues, they are true to an extent.  This is not a heavy Dream Theater release, but there are some passages that flat out rock.  However, as a rock opera, it does have a Dream Theater signature sound that oozes the quality that made them into the premiere Progressive Metal group.  People will be disappointed if they are not in the mood for a dramatic rock opera.  If they want classic Dream Theater, it is still available...so the variety in their catalog is warranted.  What I can say about the length is that this will not likely ever be something to listen to in one sitting.  It is too long if that is a desired expectation.  I cannot begin to tell you how often I listened to The Wall in bits and pieces.  I rarely listened to The Wall in one sitting, because a double album has so much music in it.  The Astonishing is like a triple disc release since the first CD is maxed out, so it is 50 minutes or one extra CD longer than The Wall in that respect.  I do not know why anyone would complain about more music from a legendary band, and I am very good about continuing where I left off in the album progress for the full linear story.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Friday, October 22, 1971 found the Dead performing their second show, of a two night stand, at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago, Illinois. The band had been introducing new songs into the set lists as well as a new piano player. This would be Keith Godchaux's third show with the band. Pigpen was sitting out after August but would be back by December.\n\nThe first set opens with Bertha, a song introduced in February, and already feels like a classic. As was common at the time, a hot Me And My uncle is next. The next two songs Tennessee Jed and Jack Straw were introduced at Keith's first show on October 19th at Northrup Auditorium in Minneapolis. The band then play a couple of more songs broken out in February with hot versions of Playing In The Band and Sugaree. Beat It One Down The Line is a nice upbeat version. The version of Black Peter on here is one of my favorites ever since the tape started circulating a couple of years ago. Mexicali Blues is another song that made it's live debut with Keith. Cold, Rain And Snow has the band returning to it's \"folk\" roots and is a keeper. Kris' Me And Bobby McGee had only been in the band's play lists about a year but it sounds as if the band has been playing it for years. The first set ends with two more song premiered at Keith's first show, Comes A Time with an extra verse soon to be dropped and One More Saturday Night. Ramble On Rose and Cumberland Blues start the second set in fine fashion. The That's It For The Other One->Deal is amazing and the set is rounded out with cool versions of Sugar Magnolia, Casey Jones->Johnny B. Goode.\n\nThe third disc is a somewhat \"short\" compilation of the great show from the first night. The first night is a standout show but the disc here is under an hour and, unfortunately, doesn't include the cool sound check of Get Back that was performed before the show and is missing quite a lot of good songs from the show. They could've easily rounded out the disc to it's maximum playing time. That's not to say what's here is bad, it most certainly isn't but an extra three songs would've made it a bit nicer hence 4 stars and not 5. 5 stars for performance!","classification":4,"fold":5}

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.

{"text":"Bailamos (Enrique Iglesias) \/ B000WLQKQ0\n\nI hadn't heard of Enrique Iglesias until he showed up on my Pandora radio play list, but this song is a truly lovely dance song. The instrumentals are stunning, and Iglesias' smooth and deep strains complement the style perfectly. There's nothing terribly *new* in this song - it's a very standard dance-and-romance song - but a song doesn't need to be innovative to be beautiful, raw, and real. Listen to the sample and you may love it.\n\nLike all Amazon MP3 downloads, this MP3 is DRM-free and plays beautifully, without fuss on my MP3 player.\n\n~ Ana Mardoll","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Mercurial, innovative and indulgent buggers - CREAM were all of it. And that's not even factoring in the fluffy haircuts and equally colourful shirts. And yet after all these decades they still get name-checked amongst the legends of the Decade - and after hearing this extensive and brilliant retrospective - it's easy to hear why \"Clapton Is God\" got painted on London West End walls towards the end of the Sixties. Here are the White Rooms and Strange Brews...\n\nReleased September 2005 - \"Gold\" is a 2CD 'Definitive Collection' on Universal\/Polydor 0602498801468 (Barcode 602498801468) and breaks down as follows:\n\nDisc 1 - IN THE STUDIO - (73:19 minutes):\n1. I Feel Free (A-side of their second UK 7\" single released December 1966 on Reaction 591 011)\n2. N.S.U.\n3. Sweet Wine\n4. I'm So Glad (tracks 2, 3 and 4 from their UK debut album \"Fresh Cream\", released December 1966 on Reaction 593 001 (Mono) and 594 001 (Stereo). Note: \"I Feel Free\" wasn't on the UK LP but was included as Track 1 on the US Atco issue and as this is an American based compilation - hence the liner notes list Tracks 1 to 4 as being from \"Fresh Cream\". Stereo Mix used)\n5. Strange Brew\n6. Sunshine Of Your Love\n7. World Of Pain\n8. Tales Of Brave Ulysses\n9. Swlabr\n10. We're Going Wrong (tracks 5 to 10 from their 2nd UK album \"Disraeli Gears\" released November 1967 on Reaction 593 003 (Mono) and 594 003 (Stereo) - Stereo mix used. FELIX PAPPALARDI (of Mountain) plays many instruments on the album and Produced the record too)\n11. White Room\n12. Sitting On Top Of The World\n13. Passing The Time\n14. Politician\n15. Those Were The Days\n16. Born Under A Bad Sign\n17. Deserted Cities Of The Sky (tracks 11 to 17 from their 3rd UK album \"Wheels Of Fire\" released August 1968 on Polydor 582 033 (Mono) and 583 033 (Stereo). It was a double album with Record 1 being Studio whilst Record 2 was Live. All tracks here are Studio Stereo mixes)\n18. Anyone For Tennis (A-side of a May 1968 UK 7\" single on Polydor 56258, non-album track at the time)\n19. Badge\n20. Doing That Scrapyard Thing\n21. What A Bringdown (tracks 19 to 21 from their final UK studio\/live album \"Goodbye\" released March 1969 on Polydor 583 053. \"Badge\" is written by Eric Clapton and George Harrison - features George Harrison on Guitar)\n\nDisc 2 - LIVE (77:32 minutes):\n1. N.S.U. (Live) - 10:17 minutes\n2. Sleepy Time Time (Live) - 6:50 minutes\n3. Rollin' And Tumblin' (Live) - 6:34 minutes (tracks 1 to 3 from \"Live Cream\" released June 1970 in the UK on Polydor 2383 016)\n4. Spoonful (Live) - 16:46 minutes\n5. Crossroads (Live) - 4:14 minutes\n6. Sunshine Of Your Love (Live) - 7:24 minutes (from the UK album \"Live Cream Volume II\" released June 1972 on Polydor 2383 119)\n7. I'm So Glad (Live) - 9:12 minutes (from their final UK studio\/live album \"Goodbye\" released March 1969 on Polydor 583 053)\n8. Toad (Live) - 16:16 minutes (tracks 4, 5 and 8 from the double-album \"Wheels Of Fire\" released August 1968 on Polydor 582 033 (Mono) and 583 033 (Stereo). It was a double album with Record 1 being Studio whilst Record 2 was Live. All tracks here are Live Stereo mixes)\n\nThe 16-page booklet is a pleasingly comprehensive affair for a 'Best Of' - nice photos of the band live and in-the-studio, decent liner notes from SCOTT SCHNIDER and full reissue credits on all songs. But the big news here is a name I always look out for - SUHA GUR. He's mastered the set and the sound quality (for their notoriously rough and ready recordings) is superb - full of power and presence yet not too amped up for the sake of it. Even the crudely recorded 'live' tracks have a great feel to them.\n\nWhat's kind of remarkable about CREAM is how well 'all' of this stuff stands up - the almost Vocal Group Pop of \"I Feel Free\" and \"Anyone For Tennis\", the 'so' Sixties lyrics of \"Swlabr\" (She Walks Like A Bearded Rainbow) right through the wailing harmonica and cool guitar Rock Blues of \"Rollin' And Tumblin'\" (Muddy Waters) and \"Crossroads\" (Robert Johnson). And who else made that \"White Room\" sound Cream made - the surprising whimsy of \"Passing The Time\" - the brilliant speed rock of \"Deserted Cities Of The Heart\" - that unbelievably hooky guitar in \"Badge\". We get \"Moby Dick making out with Captain Blyth...\" in \"What A Bringdown\" while the piano-boogie\/treated guitar of \"Doing That Scrapyard Thing\" makes them sound like a more rocked-up Badfinger on Apple or The Beatles circa Mystery Tour. There is hiss on tracks like \"Those Were The Days\", \"We Were Going\" and the wicked \"Tales Of Brave Ulysses\" which is more audible than you might want - but this was the mid Sixties - and Cream weren't going to a quiet set of lads.\n\nThe clever part of this 'definitive collection' is putting all the 'live' stuff on Disc 2 - an arena where the band really comes into its own. Although ten minutes of \"N.S.U.\" is probably indulgent - you get to hear the sheer power of the band on their cover of Willie Dixon's \"Spoonful\" (a Howlin' Wolf hit) where Clapton lets rip in a medium he loves. \"Toad\" is the same - you'd swear there was four in the band and not three - and Baker's solo is still awesome stuff.\n\nHeavy Rock practically arrived with this British band - and this cheap-as-chips 2CD gem puts that Bentley-driving guru firmly in its place...(wouldn't that be nice)...","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Aching with the beauty and mystery of a Sarah McLachlan masterpiece, `Gravity' is the perfect showcase for the haunting vocal ability possessed by Barnaby Bright; both Rachel and Nathanial complementing each other flawlessly.  The way these two vocal wonders play off one another (perfect harmony and vocal dueling alike) is mystifying.  The track really has an otherworldly feel to it, evoking a time and place far from here.  Even the lyrical content is far from phoned in, despite the use of the overused word `gravity' (why do so many singers love to use that metaphor?).  The verses are beautifully full of rich meaning, and the elaboration of that word, gravity, is executed with such lyrical depth throughout the chorus.  I love the new wave of interesting folk singers, and these guys certainly rank up there with the likes of Damien Rice, Lisa Hannigan and Gypsy Tailwind.  The acoustic guitar plays out a simple yet intricate plucking of strings while the vocals shine and take the song to new heights.  Rachel is particularly effective here.  She has such a classic beauty to her voice; soft yet sharply delicate.\n\nI'm buying their album like yesterday!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"With the surprise double-platinum success of 2001's Acoustic Soul, India. Arie became that rare bird -- particularly in contemporary R&B -- who straddles the line between artistic innovation and schmaltz. Certainly a talented guitar-playing songstress, she also takes her lyrical cues from Hallmark cards, a mix at once comfortable and off-putting -- and difficult to put one's finger on.\nThis follow-up, seemingly rushed into stores, doesn't clear up the confusion; as with Alicia Keys, it's almost impossible to criticize a contemporary urban artist who writes life-affirming, organic songs, yet this journey ends as unconvincingly as Soul or Songs in A Minor. What's more, it lacks any sort of knockout number -- Soul had two, \"Video\" and \"Brown Skin\" -- leaving us to wonder just where Arie intended on taking us.\nWhich is not to say that the potential isn't there, only that balance is not. Is she the younger visage of Tracy Chapman (\"The One,\" \"Power of Words\")? Channeling Chaka Khan on two gleefully old school steppin' tracks, \"Interested\" and \"Slow Down\"? When she takes her own advice to \"live for the moment,\" she gets better results: \"Get it Together\" is a swirling slam-dunk of a love song, and \"Good Man,\" an overlooked track off the We Were Soldiers soundtrack, makes a nice fit here. When she comes off preachy, it's with treacly results: \"God is Real\" and \"Little Things\" are cloying bits of armchair philosophy.\nVoyage is at its most interesting, and often its best, when Arie tries to come from out of the shadows of her influences and chart her own path. Though she stumbles on \"The Truth\" trying to incorporate slicker R&B-style beats into the mix, the titular Spanish folk tinges of \"Headed in the Right Direction\" says it all, as does \"India's Song,\" which could have been the album's most overwrought track but instead perfectly mixes Chapman's subdued introspection with Woody Guthrie's wide-eyed folk. These are the tracks suggest the voyage isn't over; it may have only just begun.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Casablanca Records founder Neil Bogart was at the heart of the music movement in the 1970's. He had a knack for discovering talent that was different from what was out there in the music scene. Among his discoveries were Donna Summer, Parliament and KISS- to name a few. After the dissolution of the label, he started another label named Boardwalk Records. His biggest discovery at the label was the former member of The Runaways Joan Jett. The success of the label would be short lived, as Bogart would succumb to cancer two years after founding Boardwalk. Carrying on tradition- as well as the label's name- is his son Evan \"Kidd\" Bogart. A pop songwriter, he wrote songs for the likes of Big Time Rush, Sean Kingston and Britney Spears. His discovery is the Arlington, Pennsylvania singer Zsuzsanna Eva Ward- or simply, ZZ Ward. She released the EP \"Criminal\" before releasing her major label debut \"Til The Casket Drops\" in Fall 2012.\n\nHer album was produced mostly by former Dr. Dre session musician Theron \"Neff-U\" Feemster and the production team Blended Babies. Although she's been compared to British singer Adele, Ward really sounds like a more accessible KT Tunstall. Her album starts off with the title track \"Til The Casket Drops\", a song about staying by her lover's side even during the rough times. On the bluesy first single \"Put The Gun Down\", Ward confronts the other woman responsible for taking off with her man. She's falls helplessly in love on \"Blue Eyes Blind\", while loving a man to accept her who she is on \"Home\". Rapper Kendrick Lamar guests on the song \"Cryin' Wolf\", where she deals with an inebriated boyfriend who's out on a drunken stupor. Fitz & The Tantrums lead singer Michael Fitzpatrick produces the radio friendly \"Save My Life\", while OneRepublic members Ryan Tedder and Brent Kutzle produce the lament over a failed relationship \"Last Love Song\". Former A Tribe Called Quest member Ali Shaheed Muhammad produces the acoustic track about infidelity \"Charlie Ain't Home\", while Indiana rapper Freddie Gibbs guests on the song \"Criminal\". \"Til The Casket Drops\" is a great pop record from ZZ Ward. Despite her youthful presence, her music is very mature for the music in her field. It's only a matter of time before she makes her name in the industry.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"5th album from Savannah, Georgia bandhard-charging, epic metal rock with big, rumbling guitar chords, swirling keyboards and stadium-style rock-star vocal harmonies.  Baroness inject every song with a full load of passionate effort, a wide range of instruments, and a fearless approach to arrangement (which, unfortunately, is a bit undermined here by a somewhat muddled production).  They have no fear of melody.  Theyll incorporate prog-rock elements and psychedelic riffs into the songs without a second thought.  Their twin-guitar leads carry a brazen and classy Thin Lizzy\/Wishbone Ash flow.  The vocals are clean and decipherable, even yearning sometimes.  The songs can be complex, with multiple time signature changes.  But mostly, they rocklike Mastodon, Led Zeppelin, Big Elf, Muse, Torche, Hypnos 69, The Cult & Solstafir.  Purple trades the depth of character and diversity that fed into the magnificence of their 2013 opus, Yellow & Green, for the privilege to punish its own beauty and power with an incessant heavy metal heart.  Its what the band needs to do.  And it (mostly) works.  Strong.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"For those of you who have read my previous reviews of Mushroomhead, you'd see that this is the first time I've awarded an album of theirs less than five stars. Four out of five is still very respectable, and if a half star were possible, I'd give it 4.5, but let me explain my position.\n\nThis is a very solid album if it weren't for a few tracks and few hiccups here and there. The album starts out with \"Come oN\", which is also their first released single, and ironically, the worst track on the album. The music is fair though a tad predictable, but that's not where it falls short. Here is an (edited) snippet of lyrics;\n\nCome on\nDo you really wanna **** with me?\nCome on\nDo you really wanna\n\nMH's lyrics have traditionally been poignant and meaningful so I question their motivation to write a top-40 sounding song that is graphic just to be graphic. Being a fan of Mudvayne and Korn, I'm not one to take offense to controversial lyrics so long as they're artistic in nature and expression. Lyrics like those I pointed out are entirely A-typical of anything they've ever written in the past.\n\nMy second complaint is with the guitar solos sprinkled throughout the album. They sound out of place and apologetic as if the band is asking permission to place them where they did.\n\nBut enough with the bad. Here are the high points: Beginning with \"I'll Be HerE\", the album kicks into high-gear and starts to sound like the Mushroomhead we have grown to love. I'll never fault a band for trying something new, and while this album has a definitive MH sound, it is a broad departure from their first three albums. Some are going to criticize this experiment, but it's still a very solid release.\n\nWhen a band releases their third or fourth album, one of two things usually happens. 1.) They begin to talk down to the average masses in order to spruce up their album sales or 2.) They grow up and begin writing more mature material. Mushroomhead actually did a bit of both on \"Beautiful Stories\". I'm disappointed that some of the tracks sound like radio \"singles\", but overall, the music has grown while retaining the elements that made them a stand-out act in the first place.\n\nSome of my favorites include \"Burn The BridgE\", \"The Feel\", \"Harvest The GardeN\" and \"Do I Know You?\" If you've liked MH in the past, you'll like \"Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children\". If you haven't enjoyed their previous works, you won't like this one either. Pretty simple formula, folks.","classification":4,"fold":5}

My therapist introduced me to meditation and, after I commented on how well it worked during our sessions, suggested that I try it before bed to help clear my mind. These work great for this. I especially like the ones with the birds and\/or wind sounds, it's so peaceful and not obnoxious like some of the others I've heard with excess sounds. They help me visualize that I'm in a field or something in the middle of nowhere.

{"text":"I'd heard a few of their songs, and was impressed, so I bought this CD. I am pleasantly surprised to say that I like every single song on the CD!\nWow, what a great group. Such a blessing! I have so much respect for their lyrical talent, faith and music, praise God for this group. It's one of the few Christian groups I've listened to (granted there are more and more each day) that REALLY is so good I'd listen to it for its musical quality alone. There are a few others on my list but this group is at the top. The fact that it's Christian music just really is amazing ... thank you Third Day! PLEASE keep it up!!!!! In my opinion, this CD hit it out of the park. I can't remember the last CD I bought - Christian or secular - that I liked EVERY SONG. Wow. I am so loving this CD!!!! And another thing, sometimes Christian artists try to blur the message of their songs, in order to be able to be played in other categories. I get it, I understand. But I LOVE that Third Day has kept this to a minimum. It's real, Christian music with a real, Christian message about calling out to Jesus. Super awesome! And, this man's voice is unreal. The whole group is completely talented. It's so good I'm actually surprised it hasn't been allowed to cross over to regular radio.\nAlso, some have griped about their cover art, these people have obviously never actually bought the CD, which is unfair I think ... The cover art is completely unrelated to Radiohead. It's a real place, a real mountain, called Salvation Mountain. Here's the link. [...]\nIf you actually buy the CD, you'd open it up to find lots of actual photographs of Salvation Mountain, and see that the cover art looks pretty much just like it. It's such an inspirational place, I think it's perfect for Third Day to use it for their art ... to help people find SALVATION! Salvation Mountain \/ Salvation ... see the theme here? If anything, perhaps Radiohead's cover art artist was inspired by the art done on the mountain! Buy the CD, read the inside, listen to the music - you'll have nothing negative to say. :)","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"For those of you who are familiar with the music of The Bangles, they have been called the female equivalent of the Beatles.  Their bright, sweet choral harmonies are enough to capture any listener's attention.  This was one of the bands that I had grown up with alongside Madonna, The Go Go's, and other 80's artists.  After three albums of mega smash after smash, they unfortunately imploded and took a 13 year absence.  Susanna Hoffs would create 2 solo albums, and Vicki\/Debbi Peterson would create their own records under the pseudonym Continental Drifters.\n\nSo once they reunited in 2003 and released this then-new LP, it was as if The Bangles had never left.  Although their voices sounded a bit older, so has their sound matured.  This CD starts off with a fiery one-two punch of the title track sung by Susanna.  Other songs would be very energetic as well -- Debbi's \"Stealing Rosemary\", Vicki's \"Mixed Messages\", and Michael Steele's 2 very important songs (and my personal favorites as well):  \"Nickel Romeo\" and \"Between The Two\".  Check out the lyric \"a Cheshire Cat in yellow Beatle boots...\"  Hint hint, anyone??\n\nThe only 2 songs I did not like were Susanna's \"I Will Take Care Of You\" and Debbi's \"Lost At Sea.\"  But that is only from my personal taste and bears absolutely NO reflection on the band itself!  I was very saddened\/disheartened when Michael Steele eventually left The Bangles permanently, before this decade even started.  So, in other words, you won't hear any of her tracks on the band's 2011 LP, \"Sweetheart Of The Sun.\"  I am somehow okay with that, because in all fairness, each one of the four female members DO have a very unique, distinctive voice and incredible instrumental talent that attracted droves of fans in the first place.\n\nOther than Susanna's recent 2012 solo release, \"Someday\", I'm still betting that The Bangles have some more songs left in them for the rest of this decade to follow!!  :)","classification":4,"fold":5}

Not only with I Am Sasha Fierce, but when you release too many singles from an album, it gets kind of annoying and you want to go to somewhere else. Her lastest single Why Don't You Love Me from the extended version of I Am Sahsa Fierce isn't honestly a very strong song at all. When I truthfully saw the video, I thought it was weak as a mouse. But the song really isn't Beyonce' at her best nor is it a good song. I think she should truthfully take a break, find a new creative source for her music and her sound and come back in a while to find something better to give to her fans. Why Don't You Love Me, the answer is very simple. It is a bit of overexposure to what Beyonce' has given. She really didn't give her best this time around.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":5}

You've heard about Christmas trees, Christmas presents, Christmas breakups, Christmas chaos, and in fact, you've heard just about everything, until now. A charity single, and Rob Thomas' first solo work (a whole lot better than most of his later stuff), this song sings a hymn for peace and goodwill toward men, that's not up in your face, unlike Mr. Lennon, and also unlike Lennon, there's no anti-war message! Nope, this song is a sincere piece of work, and one of Thomas' best. And unlike his later work, it builds toward something grand, and when it comes to the chorus, it soars in a magical fashion that can only happen at Christmas.\n\nOverall, one of the best modern Christmas songs I've ever heard.

{"text":"After Roadrunner decided to re-release Sepultura's Roots album for their 25th anniversary, I knew right off the bat, that they would re-release the Soulfly album as well, since it is considered to be Roots Part 2.  I was disappointed somewhat with the Roots Re-release, seeing very little new bonus material and deciding there wasn't enough information in the booklet.  I got a hold of this new edition with the aid of a gift card.  If you don't have this album yet, this is the version to buy.  If you already have had this album (such as myself), then you should hunt down a used copy or get it for a cheaper price than the $20 that Roadrunner is asking for.\n\nThere are 3 versions of this album available (not including the imports).  The original version, the original 2 disc re-release (I have that one) and now this one.  The only thing that is missing from this version is the remixes and Eye for an Eye (Live at Indigo Ranch) from the original re-release.  It's no secret that Roadrunner is re-releasing these albums as a quick cash grab from the fan.  This was Soulfly's best album by far, had Roadrunner chosen to re-release Primitive or the even worse 3, I wouldn't have bothered to take a glance.  Honestly I feel that there are better and older records that Roadrunner needs to re-release instead.  Malevolent Creation fans have been demanding for some time that Roadrunner re-releases their first three albums, but it seems that Roadrunner is taking no interest as many Soulfly, Slipknot, Trivium and Killswitch Engage fans probably haven't even heard of Malevolent Creation and it wouldn't sell as much as those, despite them being way better.  Anyways, back to this record.\n\nWe have the original album as disc one, plus the song Cangaceiro and a Discharge cover (both of which previously available on the first re-release), another Discharge cover and a rough mix of Quilambo titled Blow Away that first made an appearance on their DVD.  On disc two we have an entire concert.  Most of these songs were previously available on the original re-release and the digipak version of Primitive.  It's nice to finally have the concert in its entirety because the qualities of these songs are magnificent.  Most of the unreleased live songs are Sepultura covers though they still do not top the versions found upon the Sepultura's Under A Pale Grey Sky.  What is then followed is a Spoken word from Max Cavalera in 1997 where he talks about everything from his childhood to the Sepultura split to where he is just about to enter the studio to record the first Soulfly album.  This is very similar to a spoken word that was on the roadrunner website where Max did the exact same thing except it was just after the release of Primitive.*  Then there is a little jam at the end of the spoken word.  The disc is then closed with a 4-track demo of Eye for an Eye.\n\nThe 23 page booklet is definitely superior to that of the Roots re-release (though the music is not).  There are plenty of pictures found within, they discuss the recording process, the Soulfly name, the first demos, the hilarious skunk incident with short time guitarist Jackson \"Lucio\" Bandeira, and the meanings and ideas behind each song (something that they failed to do with the Roots re-release).  It answers a lot of questions as to the recording process of this album.\n\nThe music found on this release (and every Soulfly album) is definitely inferior to most Max era Sepultura albums, however, the original re-release was one of the first albums that I bought and it ended up having an effect upon me as to what I looked for in my music.  I discovered Sepultura because of this album and Sepultura has become one my favorite bands.  I haven't listened to Soulfly in what seemed like a year until this was released, probably because every release got worse and worse and more religious.  Yes this album is weaker than Sepultura, yes this barely has any double bass, and yes it is a little nu-metal.  But it's not that bad.  This album is well done, the only Soulfly album I can listen to from start to finish without pressing the skip button and one of the few good instances of Nu-Metal.  The amount of guests present is not nearly as bad as later albums and according to Max in the booklet, the inclusion of Fred Durst was more of an idea of Ross Robinson than of Soulfly's.\n\nAre there any problems found within?  Throughout the booklet Max speaks of his original 4-track demos.  A large paragraph discusses the original lyrics for the 4-track demo of the song No.  However, the only 4-track demo we get is for Eye for an Eye.  Where are the rest?  Buried deep within Roadrunners Vault.\n\nRoadrunner records didn't have to re-release this album.  They could have made a 2 disc collection of the material from here, other rare songs from Max's journey with Soulfly plus the bonus songs on Imports and tributes.  Basically they could have made a Soulfly version of Sepultura's Blood Rooted.\n\nI apologize for the length of this review however I felt that I needed to say all that is to be said, so that Soulfly\/Sepultura\/Max fans can expect what to find on this re-release.  If you already have one of the original two versions of this record, I suggest that you get a copy of this cheap and\/or used because this whole 25th anniversary thing that roadrunner has going is just a cash grab from the fans.  I will state that this re-release is done excellently and therefore earns five stars because of how well it's done and the music is the best that Soulfly has made.  Hoped this helped.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"What happens when one of the greatest composers of R&B\/Funk discovers a woman who would go on to become one of the greatest singers of R&B\/Funk is Tell Me Something Good. Stevie Wonder was deep into his Funk classics like You Haven't Done Nothin' and Boogie On Reggae Woman when he first heard Chaka Khan & Rufus and the word is, virtually on-the-spot, wrote Tell Me Something Good for her. It's one of his best songs, one of her best songs and one of the best early 70's songs, period.\n\nIt's stripped down, too, right to the essentials. It doesn't have the multiple rhythms of a typical Wonder song of the time, it doesn't have the elaborate vocals of Earth, wind & Fire or Kool & the Gang, or the smooth horn section of the Ohio Players. But it doesn't need all that because it has Chaka Khan singing her heart out. This song tore up the airwaves in 1974 and is just as good today.","classification":5,"fold":5}

This is mostly an instrumental recording of songs that were produced in 1993 and worked on in the past year or so by the surviving members minus Roger Waters.\nI was impressed with the opening track sounding quite like a song from Wish You Were Here. Then it gets interesting, very trippy, experimental and the trademark Gilmour guitar sound. The track featuring Nick Mason on drums is a favourite of mine 'Skins'.\nThe BluRay has a lot of great video footage of the band in action from 1993. The 5.1 mix sounds a bit conservative to me but still enjoyable.\nOverall this is a very worthy album but I will say is not for everyone's taste.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Maybe the time has come to reconcile with Barbra's music. After years of refusing to listen to her albums, I thought I should give this new one a try. So, I asked a friend to burn me a copy of \"Partners\" just before its official release. After reluctantly playing the entire album once, 3 days later I am secretly enjoying it. In fact, I think that spin after spin it sounds better and better. Streisand's dominating voice is unmatched, to the point of often paying more attention to her delivery technique, instead of focusing on the actual songs. Nevermind that the material overall is a little too lacklustre, some of it is pretty good. The opening duet with the velvety-voiced Michael Buble, \"It had to be you\", is just wonderful, and so is the gorgeous reindition of \"Somewhere\" with Josh Groban. And the duets with Lionel Richie, Andrea Bocelli, and Elvis, are very enjoyable, too. Some of the other tracks are helplessly lukewarm, but, if I can develop a liking for some of this material, then dedicated fans will most probably love this record. It is a great idea to introduce old songs to a younger audience, so maybe a \"Partners\" version with female duets could follow? With such a powerful throat at 72, she sure is able to keep recording for years to come. I may have been ignoring her music, but she is a living legend. And, though she may not be my cup of tea, I am certainly enjoying a few Barbra sips!","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"Let me state upfront that I am a Gary Numan fan from the early days (starting with Tubeway Army in the late 70s), and it's been a wild ride over the years. After seemingly running out of ideas, Numan released a brilliant album in 2000 called \"Pure\", one of his very best ever. But subsequent albums like \"Hybrid\" and \"Jagged\" didn't really do it for me. Now comes Numan's latest studio album.\n\n\"Splinter (Songs From a Broken Mind)\" (12 tracks; 55 min.) starts with a brilliant \"I Am Dust\" and it immediately feels like this album connects to \"Pure\" in many ways. \"Everything Comes Down To This\" comes straight out of the NIN playbook: dark, hard, yet it transfixes you. \"The Calling\" sounds just eerie (and that is meant as a compliment). The best track of the album for me is \"Love Hurt Bleed\" (UK single), which romps and reminds me of Numan's \"Telekon\" album. Yet deeper into the album, another highlight is \"We're The Unforgiven\", with even some danceable beats in it. There are a couple of 'naked' ballads, including \"Lost\" (just Gary and piano for the most part), and the album closer \"My Last Day\". At 55 min. the album runs a bit too long and it is a lot to take it all in at first. But that doesn't take away from the fact that this is clearly Numan's best album since \"Pure\".\n\nNot to date myself, but the first time I saw Gary Numan in concert was in September 28, 1979 at the Hammersmith Odeon in London, on the Pleasure Principle Tour (which would give us the Living Ornaments 1979 live album, still the essential Gary Numan album for me, period). It's a shame that Numan doesn't tour the US more often, the most recent time I saw him live was here in Cincinnati in 2006, already 7 years ago. If you have a chance to see Numan in concert, do not miss him! Meanwhile, \"Splinter (Songs From a Broken Mind\") is a nice addition to the rich and ever-growing catalog of Gary Numan studio albums. A must have for any Numan fan!","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\" is one of the definitive songs of the 1980's.  Although they didn't write the song and were the fourth choice to record it,  Simple Minds transformed it into an anthem.  They perfectly captured the angst and self-absortion of the middle to upper class teen.  The opening riff and hey hey hey hey, ooh ooo start are instantly recognizable and iconic.  The song meshes seamlessly into what John Hughes was trying to capture on screen with The Breakfast Club and they permanently intertwined.  It is impossible to think of one without the other.  The song was a monster hit in the spring of 1985, going all the way to number one.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Trina's 'Still Da Baddest' may be part of the rap genre but the music on this release isn't as hardcore and 'rap' as one would expect, which I actually think is part of this release's strength. My main criticism that makes this average is that even after a few listens, a lot of the songs blend in together and fail to stand out. The sound, production and lyrics are rather bland and aren't exciting. A positive thing about these songs is that, to me, it's more of a blend of pop and rap than straight forward rapping. Even with the 'explicit' label, there's only one or two songs that are from start to finish explicit as we'd come to expect from Trina. She does manage to dabble with a rap-ballad in 'I Got a Thang For You' and full-blown pop in 'Single Again.' The title track 'Still Da Baddest' is another rather pop-sound with Trina proclaiming and listing reasons why she's at the top of her game. Other stand-out tracks are 'Killing You Hoes' and 'Hot Commodity'.\n\nAs a whole, 'Still Da Baddest' is just average. It's good, but I wish there was more variety and that the songs stood out more from one another. She's at her best when she's trying out new sounds and genres like on songs 'Single Again' and 'I Got A Thang For You' but falls flat when she's intentionally trying to shock the audience with something dirty and explicit, like on 'Look Back at Me'. I also wish she had dug deeper lyrically because on many tracks she's simply rapping about her body and how she's better than others out there; it's good on one song but sounds tired after two or three. A decent release though with some really good tracks and the some that could have been left off due to a lack of creativity and production.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"This is an album the Blue Oyster Cult fans will really get into, a concept album that showcases the bands unique song stylings. For the casual listener, or sometime BOC fan, stick with \"Agents of Fortune\" or \"Fire of Unknown Origin\". \"Imaginos\" is a heavy album and features a great remake of \"Astronomy\", the best song on the CD. But unless you are prepared to invest some time, deciphering the story, and songs you won't get much out of the album. I picked up \"Imaginos\" on CD after hearing \"Astronomy\" late at night (the best time to play the CD), and there was a narrative about the \"Imaginos\" myth read by Stephen King as the song opened. I heard this only two times on the radio, and picked up the CD because I was a huge Stephen King fan, and enjoyed some of BOC's earlier albums. Needless to say, the Stephen King narrative is not on the album. I was disappointed, but played the disk a few times. I enjoyed \"I Am The One You Warned Me Of\", a pretty straight ahead rocker, and \"In The Presence of Another World\" which is a more down-tempo song. Actually most of the songs are good, and you will find yourself humming the chorus for hours after listening. The only track that I found lacking, was the title track \"Imaginos\". For some reason, most likely the background singers: \"Oooohhhh Imaginos, Ooooohhh Imaginos, Oooooohhhh, ooooohhh, ooohhhh Imaginos\" the song sounds like fanfare for a two bit magician about to perform in Vegas or something. Once I got that image stuck in my head, I just kept picturing Imaginos The Great performing card tricks and turning newspaper into doves. If you see a copy of this disk used for under $10 pick it up, but I don't think it's worth the $20 used price I see here.","classification":3,"fold":5}

The melody, along with John Rzeznik's gravely, almost desperate vocals, makes for a hauntingly beautiful song of forbidden love.

{"text":"Months after the release I have to say this cd ain't as good to me now as it was then and Nas's cd N**** is better and so is T.I's recent release. I rarely play this cd now and actually am more likely to play Da Drought 3, Like Father Like Son, or Tha Carter 2 before I put this one in. Below is the review I wrote on the week this was released. I still stand by what I said as far as those four songs now not 13 that were creative; the rest are good, good songs but nothing classical.\nPeople hated Kobe too, but the best will shine. Hardest part for me was determining is this a classic or not since three songs on this cd are not good (Got Money, Comfortable, Mrs. Officer), but when I had to think about how many times I rewound like 13 songs over and over just out of sheer enjoyment I had to say yeah when most classics consist of 10songs or 13. This is true melodious art and lyrical gymnastics,& not something you've heard on your typical assembly line rap.\nMost folk that don't like Weezy aren't from the South...well too bad for u suck it up and swallow deez in ya' mouth. And due to what I've heard over the years I have to say it's a classic for these times and yes for these times Weezy is artistically the best at rappping while flipping styles and riding beats with his voice and vocally catching singer's notes while rapping (he's sick when it comes to this).This really is his niche and because he's so much better at it than any, any other rapper it makes people that like this style of rapping (rapping while switching your voice, melodious tones, vocal creativity, intriguing choruses, punch line raps built on the flow riding the beat instead of first doing a rap and then attaching a beat behind it) think he is the best rapper out now. This talent makes his other deficiencies seem not so apparent to those who like him and those who are too young to know raps history. The biggest critique is when it comes to lyrics and content and probably word for word rhyming he is not even in the top 10. This is why when people like Jay or Andre3000 or even BunB feature with him he doesn't out shine them like Nas, Eminem, and Pac used to. Lyrically not in the same conversation as Chino XL, Immortal, Ghostface, Genius, Cube,Big Daddy Kane, Rakim,the list goes on. Some of these artists had weaknesses too, so like them he has his but quit the hating on true talent. It's like listening to Thriller and asking \"where's the political content\" like Marvin Gaye's What's Goin On.  Bottom line to New Yorkers who basically don't like anything not N.Y. and only tolerate other rappers if you can say Method Man's Tical is a classic (which I consider it to be) where he basically doesn't talk about nothing then you should be able to see where Wayne's coming from artistically. Musically, he's like a young Method Man before he sold out and became lame.\nHow many artists sound like something you've already heard?Wayne is original for the most part, he has adopted some of his 10 styles to rapand Wayne does his own choruses and they sound like...music. If you can't respect the lack of meaningful lyrics you have to respect the artist and what he's doing musically--cause straight up it is rare. Just cause you don't like him doesn't mean he isn't doing something creative. I didn't like Jordan, but he is the undisputed GOAT.Wayne ain't near a GOAT, but when it comes to flow and riding beats he his probably number one or two.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"It is honestly and absolutely so sad that when someone young and talented, really has thrown their own career away. For Nicki Minaj, she has really made more music that has been mediocre and lacking real drive as a rapper. The list of songs she has put out for her Pink Print album has definitely wasted her own talent away, than a real sense of what real talent is suppose to be. Her collaborations with others on the album have really dragged her talent down, Only for example with Chris Brown and Drake among others, just really was one of her worst songs in her own career. Feeling Myself is another example. Her collaboration with Beyonce' doesn't actually ignite any heart by bringing in the so-called queen bee into the mix. I really found the song to be less than striking at all. Nicki and Beyonce' have absolutely no chemistry together. I think Nicki really has made some very poor songs from her Pink Print album, and this is honestly one of her weakest.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":5}

{"text":"You may remember Crossfade, as coming out from nowhere with their big hit single in 2004 with \"Cold.\" Since that song faded out on the airwaves, it's been a pretty low-profile for the band. Well, here we are in 2006, the band has ditched their turntablist\/backing vocalist and have emerged with a new album, \"Falling Away\" that promises more and more radio-play, with each and every song seemingly tailor-made for mainstream rock stations.\n\nDoes anything live up to the catchiness and effect of their one big hit? Well, like their debut, the answer is pretty much \"no.\" There are a few songs that show true growth and improvement, such as \"Breathing Slowly\" \"Never Coming Home\" and \"Washing The World Away.\" Songs like \"Invincible\" and \"Someday,\" however, come across as feeble attempts to recapture that magic. For those who dug the rap-rock vibes of the first CD, you'll be disappointed to find that element is missing (thanks to a missing member, I presume). Personally, I think they're the better for it, but if \"Death Trend Setta\" was your thing, you'll probably hate this album.\n\nI'm not gonna say this album is all bad. The three tracks I mentioned are definitely worth looking into this album for, and catchy rock-filler like \"Anchor\" and \"Falling Away\" help make it a more appealing listen. It's a better album than the first one, but still a far cry from greatness. The sad fact is that Crossfade's sound is nothing overly original or inspiring. Just simple modern-rock for the masses -- not that there's anything wrong with that...","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"Cher's follow-up release to her blockbuster album \"Believe\" was \"Living Proof.\"  It is another album in the dance\/club music vein, though it is a darker and much more cynical collection than \"Believe.\"  Cher pulls it off beautifully though.\n\nRight before this album came out, 9\/11 happened.  Cher dedicates the tribute song \"A Song For the Lonely\" to the \"Courageous People of New York\" who endured through the horrible event. When I last saw her in concert (Farewell Tour, 2005, Glendale AZ) and this video was shown in the ampitheater, I was struck by the WTC symbolism and how moving the song was.  This CD has a link to the video and it is definitely worth watching.\n\nI think \"Believe\" was a much-more commercially viable disc than \"Living Proof,\" though I think that \"Living Proof\" is a more powerful recording. It also took me a few listenings for me to really start to like it.  It's packed with great songs.  I always thought that Diane Warren's \"Body to Body, Heart to Heart\" should have been released as a single.\n\nThe record company antics of releasing different versions of the disc in the U.S. and Europe are a bit tiresome: the European versions contained additional songs and short-changed U.S. fans.  The same company did the same thing with the \"It's A Man's World\" disc in the mid-90s.  It's all about the bucks, I know, but enough is enough.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"If you want my opinion, the idea that this was held back for use as a FIFTH single is INSANE. A much stronger track than anything previously dropped to radio (from Born This Way, I mean here), MARRY sounds more like something from The Fame -- this sounds like a Springsteen-Jovi combo that got written on keys (instead of guitar -- note that the track is in C Major throughout) and kept slow (is this thing really only clocked at 64 BPM...?!!) -- this strikes me as an old Pat Benatar tune that might have been re-made by Donna Summer. It's all kinds of massive; the record EXPLODES from your speakers.\n\nI swear I hear a vox double just beneath the top vocal here; if you listen, you can barely discern a second vocal track that Gaga recorded into the red. This sounds, to me, as if it were then re-mixed in such a way that the two vox tracks are melded together. The buzzy, almost-in-the-red synth contrasts nicely with the church bells, although the funk breakdown going into the final earworm-shove strikes me as being of utterly no value whatsoever (I'll be the first to admit here that I have no better idea(s) for the break -- a guitar\/sax solo simply doesn't fit, here). Gaga does hit a legit & clean E5 in MARRY; I think it's time to admit that Gaga actually does have a voice... I honestly suspect that one day, she's gonna release something with a MAJOR display of vocal power; I'm kinda curious if she's been sitting on a powder-keg of vocal force that she intends to shock everybody with (at some point). That would be cool to see; doing it live is the obvious crux.\n\nI'm gonna say once again here that MARRY really should have been the lead-off single, dropped directly to radio before the release of the album -- and then I'm going to shut-up about it. It's an exceptionally strong record that I actually don't hear a ton of ringtones within (re-mix potential here is huge, of course); what we have here is simply a song, that, to me, sounds as if it came straight out of 1977; perhaps a throw-away from Pat Benatar that got dug out of the Jovi vault and wound-up being re-made by some old random disco queen. Bonnie Tyler could have done this 30-odd years ago, you know it...?\n\nYeah.\n\n4 stars.\n\nA solid effort.","classification":4,"fold":5}

Many of the songs should remain as such, unable to stand on their own as solid songs.\n\n'Good Life' is not one of these songs.

Ryan Tedder's delivery is so whimsical that it lends to the spirit of the song without for a moment taking away from the emotions being projected. 'Good Life' is one of those pop songs that almost impossible to dislike; it's so simple and yet so infectious that it could be blasted from speakers just as easily as it could be softly played while reading a novel.

{"text":"BACK TO BLACK, the latest album by British singer Amy Winehouse, is a stunning exhibit of what passes these days as Neo-Soul.  Winehouse has delivered an album that is both contemporary and nostalgic at the same time.\n\nTo my ears, there are four solid classics included in this collection, REHAB, YOU KNOW I'M NO GOOD, TEARS DRY ON THEIR OWN and BACK TO BLACK, with ME AND MR. JONES close behind.  Each of these songs mines a 60's Motown\/Phil Spector vein, but is made current by Winehouse's strong vocals and cunning, detail-oriented, love gone wrong lyrics. Amy's voice brings to mind jazz singers such a Billie Holliday and Cassandra Wilson as well as the full gamut of 60's singers from the Shangri-Las to Dusty Springfield.  The album tends to cool off towards the second half, but overall is very strong.\n\nBACK TO BLACK is a solid album that seems to have struck a chord and could be the soundtrack to the summer of 2008.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Al Stewart (had a big radio hit with the song Year of the Cat) said recently that he still has a great fondness for \"jangle-y bands\" -- guitar-based good time pop music that rocks, but not too hard.  What the Bangles have produced on Doll Revolution is a classic of the jangle-y genre.\nWhen a band takes a break of over a decade and then re-forms for a new project, there is always justifiable worry that the old magic can't be captured again. The Bangles proved an exception to the rule by producing the strongest work of their career on this long-awaited new album. Granted, not every tune on Doll Revolution is a solid gold gem, but there are at least ten well-turned songs on this record, which is about the most anyone can reasonably ask.\nIf you liked the old Bangles, there is no reason you shouldn't be happy with the new Bangles. They can still rock, and sing beautifully produced and sincere love songs. If anything, their harmonies are sweeter and more perfect than ever. The recording does not have state-of-the-art clarity, which is a bit of a disappointment, but the fidelity is at least equivalent to their previous records from the eighties.\nThere is one sour note, not in the music, but in the fact that if you want the lyrics, you won't get them in the booklet. They are found only on the limited edition DVD version -- on the DVD. So you are supposed to run to your DVD player every time you want to check out the song lyrics? Not cool.\nThe Bangles have shown that you *can* go home again. They recorded this album on their own terms, took their time, and carefully crafted something they could be proud of. And they should be proud. This is good stuff. It isn't revolutionary, despite the title. They sing of love, loss, confusion, frustration, and loneliness. They make it rhyme, and they make us tap our feet and smile. I can't ask for more than that.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I am a Yes fan caught between two factions. I entered the Yes world at age 11 in 1984, buying a cassette of \"90125\" after liking \"Owner Of A Lonely Heart\", \"Leave It\" and \"It Can Happen\"--all Trevor Rabin penned songs. This might cause anger and disgust with older Yes fans as I am sure many of them did not\/do not enjoy the Rabin-era Yes (1983-1994). I sure do, but I also liked \"Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe\". I think it's fair to say that most 11 year old kids were not listening to Yes, even if they were more marketable in the 1980's. Since that time I have embraced progressive rock: King Crimson, ELP, Genesis, Rush, but Yes win the title of best progressive rock band of all time in my book. I now own all of their albums, and I listened to all of them in sequential order leading up to \"Fly From Here\".\n\nMy first listen was jarring. Benoit David's vocals are not Jon Anderson. Trevor Horn, Chris Squire and Steve Howe cleverly mimicked Jon Anderson on 1980's \"Drama\", but the same is not true here. Benoit David is serviceable, but he does not have the range or depth of Jon Anderson's one-of-a-kind vocals. He also is not a primary songwriter here. This means he is singing what the band has given him. That must have been difficult. It is much harder to sing something that you did not write, and you might not feel committed to. Still, with repeated listening, Benoit David's vocals end up being fine, but in no way does it change my preference for Jon Anderson whether he has asthma or other respiratory issues or not. Whether his voice isn't the same now that he is in his late 60's or not. Jon Anderson is Jon Anderson, founding member of Yes.\n\nI'm tired of all the talk about Trevor Horn and Geoffrey Downes resurrecting old Buggles tracks for this album. I don't care. I liked The Buggles, and I like Yes. The problem I have with the suite of \"Fly From Here\" that opens the album is why did the band feel they needed to make six separate parts? There was a time when Yes would boldly make 20+ minute songs, heck, they'd even make a double album of four long tracks. What happened here? Personally, I think they should have ditched the overture, \"Bumpy Ride\" and the reprise and just stuck with the three main tracks: \"We Can Fly\", \"Sad Night At The Airfield\" and \"Madman At The Screens\". These three songs combined, without any stupid segues, would have made a great singular opening track--re-asserting that Yes is back with a vengeance. But no, they divide the song up into six parts that lose focus.\n\nThe second half of \"Fly From Here\" is a total mess. Chris Squire's \"The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be\" is one of the weakest Yes songs ever made and reeks of vanity project. \"Life On A Film Set\" is okay, but nothing special. Surprisingly, it is Steve Howe who saves the album's second half with \"Hour Of Need\" which sounds like a classic Yes ballad, not unlike something Jon Anderson might come up with. Then there's Howe's instrumental \"Solitaire\". Much has been said about this track as being one of his finest ever. Really? I dare say that I like \"Sketches In The Sun\" from Howe's side project \"GTR\" from 1986 (I actually own it on cd, and I bought it on cassette originally in May 1986 when it was released at the tender age of 13). Lastly, \"Into The Storm\" finishes off the album pretty nicely. I have to admit that I didn't really notice Oliver Wakeman's input on the keyboards. I'm sure he's there, but his playing blends seamlessly like a session musician's rather than standing out. I mean, Rick Wakeman's contributions stood out. I knew he was playing. Not so for Oliver, and that may be no fault of his own, but more Horn and Squire's doing.\n\nAs other reviewers have said here, this isn't Yes' best work or worst. The guys are old now, not just older. They chose to not have Jon Anderson this time out. It's been a decade between albums (that's several generations of music listeners who are just now finding out about Yes for the first time). \"Fly From Here\" is passable, and does seem to get better with repeated listening. So three stars for being above average Yes.\n\nHere's how \"Fly From Here\" compares with Yes' previous works:\n\n1969 Yes: Three and a Half Stars\n1970 Time And A Word: Three and a Half Stars\n1971 The Yes Album: Four Stars\n1971 Fragile: Five Stars\n1972 Close To The Edge: Five Stars\n1973 Tales From Topographic Oceans: Three and a Half Stars\n1974 Relayer: Four Stars\n1977 Going For The One: Three and a Half Stars\n1978 Tormato: Four Stars\n1980 Drama: Three and a Half Stars\n1983 90125: Five Stars\n1987 Big Generator: Three and a Half Stars\n1989 Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe: Five Stars\n1991 Union: Three Stars\n1994 Talk: Four Stars\n1996-1997 Keystudio: Four Stars\n1997 Open Your Eyes: Two and a Half Stars\n1999 The Ladder: Three and a Half Stars\n2001 Magnification: Four Stars\n2011 Fly From Here: Three Stars","classification":3,"fold":5}

Today's artists have raised the bar though and so Eiffel 65's originality has been a little bit lost in the crowd.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"When this song was released in the late 90s it was like a breath of fresh air for me.  In one sense, it was a typical rock song from that era but this song incorporated a melodic intro (I believe it is a heavily processed guitar arpeggio), an odd base line, and the unique vocals from the lead singer of the group that just jumped out.  Great song that brings back great memories.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"\"New Constellation\" marks a strong return by Toad the Wet Sprocket.  The title track is catchy and memorable. Favorite tracks include \"California Wasted\" and \"The Moment.\"\n\nIf you loved Toad back in the 90's, you'll enjoy this album. It's a bit lighter in tone and feel than some of their late 90's fare, but still keeps the Toad sound. They're not trying to be something they're not.  Glen Phillips' recent forays into more electronic music (via Remote Tree Children, Plover) is reflected here only in a bit more focus on catchy hooks, a little less 90's angst.\n\nMost of the tracks are co-written by Glen Phillips and lead guitarist Todd Nichols or bassist Dean Dinning, so this remains a cohesive band. Todd Nichols takes the lead on a few tracks and works well within the band's sound, one of the underappreciated elements of the band's albums in the 90's. Too often bands reunite, but only end up reflecting the current musical tastes of their lead singer. It's nice to see this album as a true band effort.\n\nOnly disappointment is that the liner notes are a bit sparse (no lyrics included).","classification":5,"fold":5}

It's sophisticated enough that it transcends its 1986 birth era, its beat and sax solo elevating it above its concurrent dark synth-glop.  It holds up very well 25 years down the road.\n\nBut the unwise choice of band name has tied this song--all BM songs--to awkward DJ attempts at explanation and sometimes direct repudiation of a cutesy youthful band name choice that also happens to be a racial epithet against aboriginal Australians.  I'm hearing less and less of this song--any BM song--on the Sirius\/XM 80s or new wave channels, and I have to wonder if this is the reason.  The need to satisfy listeners' natural curiosity about a divergent band name I believe has lead to uncomfortable storytelling, and a great little pop song suffers for it.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"If you need to fill holes in your Schubert  collection, or you're looking to replace that lost or broken CD.  Or, if you've never bought a Schubert CD or MP3, then this is the collection for you - at $1.99 you can hardly go wrong.  You can't beat the price with a stick and you get hours and hours of quality music by one of the greatest Romantic  composers of all time.  This includes standards such as Moments Musicaux, and Marche Militaire, as well as the Unfinished Symphony No. 8.  In fact it includes symphonies 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 & 9, plus chamber music, a Winter Jouney song cycle, impromptus, piano pieces, a full Mass, and Music to Rosamunde amongst others.  This is music at it's best!  Shubert was clearly a genius, and it shows on the tracks on this MP3 download.  Use it for enjoying, listening, or as the background for your life.  It's strong and beautiful!\n\nFOR THE MUSIC PURISTS:  Use this to fill holes in your collection - it's so cheap, it's almost like stealing.  There's so much here that you can't go wrong, even if some aren't perfectly executed.\n\nFOR EVERYONE ELSE: Use this to build your collection.  There are at least 8 other MP3 downloads like this one which would start the basis for a lovely classical music library. If you get to the point where a piece doesn't sound right, or bothers you in any way, go out and explore alternatives.  There are tons out there.  What I like, you may not, and vice versa.  For example, the only people I like play Rachmaninoff are Rachmaninoff and Mischa Dikter.  Yet, I'm told a lot of people play him well - I just don't agree.  It's all personal taste.  Take recommendations, but figure out what you like yourself.\n\n At $1.99 each, that makes it under $18.00 to have 1800 tracks of 9 classical masters, ranging from Bach to Debussy. You can't even buy a family of 4 fastfood for that little.  Or you could buy 18 tracks on i-tunes, not 1800.  I can tell you, I did it, and it's been the soundtrack to the greater part of my life since I did so.  It especially makes wonderful background music while reading anything from fiction to nonfiction - and of course making dinner.  You can't beat this deal - just buy this!  Buy all of them!

{"text":"Jamie Foxx is such a talented fellow; he acts, plays the piano, sings, and makes you laugh.  Although he started his career as a comedian, he was always serious and passionate about singing.  I appreciate anyone who is serious about their craft, but I think he sounds very whiny when he sings.  His voice never appealed to me much, but I tolerate it because I like him and he's extremely popular.  He does have a decent voice and good vocal control, but the actual sound of his singing voice is what I don't care for.\n\n \"Intuition\" is his third musical installment.  As with his second LP, \"Unpredictable\", there are a heap amount of guest appearances, but that's fine because in this instance, that actually helped improve the album.  \"Just Like Me\" is the first single and it features the ubiquitous T.I.  These two men do a fine job together.  All of the songs that were released, I either don't like them, or they took awhile to get into and \"Just Like Me\" is no exception.  \"Blame It\" is a bit more catchy than the aforementioned track, but both tracks are highlights.  The video for \"Blame It\" features lots of celebrities like Samuel L. Jackson and Forest Whitiker.  This song is simply saying that whatever happens tonight at the club, blame it on the alcohol.  Obviously, he is talking about having a one night stand more so than anything else.  \"Slow\" is one of the ballads found here.  Sexy is the tone of this song because of the fashion in which it is sung and the production.  \"She Got Her Own\" is one of the worse songs I have heard in a long time.  Though this song features the incredible Neyo and the wonderful Fabolous, it is annoying and Neyo should have not continued creating songs that have the same gist as \"Miss Independent\" because we got the point.\n\n  This is a cool album for the moment, but by no means is it timeless or a classic.  After 2009, you'll probably be ready to deep six it, honestly.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"Just Like Me\"\n2. \"Freak'in Me\"\n3. \"Blame It\"\n4. \"Why\"\n5. \"Number One\"","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"So Jackson, who was clearly listening to a lot of Bob Dylan records at the time, decided he wanted to be like a certain critically acclaimed, commercially successful living legend\/cynical street poet with a really bad voice - only with a considerably better voice (technically speaking, anyway) and soft-rock instrumentation. Really, he only blew it on one count. Too bad that count was he didn't have the talent of Dylan's elbow. He tackles weighty topics - depression, suicide, drug addiction, apocalypse - but he doesn't say anything too revealing about any of them, and we wind up with several spare piano and acoustic guitar ballads that are lifeless and unoriginal, if earnest (\"For Adam\", \"My Opening Farewell\", \"A Child in These Hills\", et al). But he doe nail a couple of these: \"Jamaica Say You Will\" is a lovely ballad that's been covered by just about everybody; the piano-driven, pessimistic \"Doctor My Eyes\" is probably my favorite of Jackson's songs, and actually is pretty good as far as Dylan knock-offs go; and \"Rock Me on the Water\" is enjoyably apocalyptic. Now if the rest weren't so turgid, we'd have a classic on our hands.","classification":2,"fold":5}

That's why I went looking for it, and I assume many other people as well.\n\nSecondly, compared to the original pop version, this take on In For The Kill delivers a much deeper soul and feel that penetrates down to your very core. That said, this song is most assuredly NOT representative La Roux's sound. I know because I initially bought the full regular album and was a bit surprised by their kind of vanilla upbeat pop sound. I wish La Roux would do more songs like this alternate version here, but so far this appears to be a unique gem in their otherwise dance-happy catalog.","classification":4,"fold":5}

In the backdrop of the times These Boots Are Made For Walkin' was one of the rallying cries of women fed up with the traditional roles of homemaker and mommy.  These Boots Are Made For Walkin' was more than a song it was a metaphor that spoke to empowerment of the so called weaker sex.  More than just a woman's rallying cry this was a darn good song too.  This song like so many others is a joyful part of my 1960's era childhood.  In 2014 its fun to look back into the world now long gone.  Sometimes when I listen to these songs like These Boots Are Made For Walkin' I remember listening to the car radio, the memory is sometimes so vivid can almost smell the Ford Fairlane 500 that was our family car.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Whoa. I was used to hearing Brecker in your average funk-fusion (a bit smoother than I like sometimes), and straight-ahead blowing sessions, so this one really took me by surprise. Here he assembled a unique combination of instruments - among them strings, guitar and a somewhat unique (including French horn and Baritone) brass section - which gives the music a kind of heft and richness that is just a joy to hear. The arrangements are great - interesting horn\/string lines underneath Brecker's usual masterful and fiery soloing. My faves are \"Night Jessamine\", and \"Modus Operandi\" which are two of the grooviest and funkinest jazz songs I've heard in quite a while. The only tiny complaint I have is that Brecker is virtually the only soloist. He gives bassist Pattituci a few spots, as well as a couple for the guitarist and trumpeter, but most of the time it is him wailing on and on. Mind you, he is an awesome soloist, I love his playing, but sometimes you need to break it up a bit and let the other guys shine for a while, too - that is what Jazz is about, individual expression, while still serving the collective. Not even the great Coltrane had a problem letting Eric Dolphy, Don Cherry, or his own McCoy Tyner shine for a while. But, aside from that, this is a superb effort from one of the most important saxophonists since Coltrane. Keep it up, Mike.","classification":5,"fold":5}

He's a very popular artist but that album had fans a bit divided. I think it's his most underrated work in his discography and to me lyrically it's untouched by any of his other albums (as of 7\/28\/13). It really speaks to me.\n\nThis album is really close lyrically though. I might even go as far as saying this is his second best album behind&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Heavier-Things\/dp\/B0000ALSDR\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Heavier Things<\/a>&nbsp;and a PINCH better than 2006's amazing release&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Continuum\/dp\/B0014VPFTA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Continuum<\/a>&nbsp;(sorry guys!). This album is very country and supposedly has genres in it like Americana too (I don't normally listen to that so I'm unsure). So in that way it's very different from most of the material he has done beforehand. But the pinnacle of the record is its mood. There are a couple of tracks that are more upbeat like \"Queen Of California\" and \"Something Like Olivia\" and those tracks are good. But the meat of the record comes from the more melancholy tracks that breathe life into it. \"If I Ever Get Around To Living\" is by far my favorite selection and has this very relaxing vibe about it. The guitar work isn't crazy intense like what we heard on \"Continuum\" but it is nonetheless still very effective. The second half of the album seems to be the moodiest and brings out the best songs.\n\nI love every single song here. I wasn't so sure about the route he was taking when I first heard \"Shadow Days\" but I eventually did like the tune. After getting the record home some time soon after its release and spinning it a couple of times I really loved it. And if I recall correctly it has remained the only John Mayer record that has made me shed tears over thinking about an ex.

She has shown real beauty & soul from the voice within with each note she has sung. But it is surprising that it has been over 15 years since she broke out with Songs In A Minor. The album had launched her soulful reign as one of the most premiere artists of the 2000 decade & beyond. Whenever I listen to Songs In A Minor, I do enjoy each track from start to finish. Fallin' is absolutely one of my favorites & her third single A Woman's Worth is also one song that shows real beauty from the eyes of a lady, into what a man wants at the heart from someone to stand by him. I really love how deep the soul is from Alicia, but a lot of people have forgotten about this song after awhile. Still, when you listen to Alicia Keys, you know she is in the pantheon of the greatest songstresses in the world, whether it is Whitney Houston, Roberta Flack or Nina Simone.

Written by Stevie Nicks, it became the only U.S. number one hit for the group, and even today, so many years later, it remains one of their best known songs. That first LP went it's own way years later, but was replaced with a CD copy. That one still surfaces in my untidy collection now and then, but when I saw the MP3 version here, it was an instant no brainer to grab it.\n\nThat classic classic disc was the number-one album on the charts for over 30 weeks, and Rolling Stone named \"Rumours\" as the 25th greatest album of all time. Today it ranks as the 10th best-selling album ever, with more than 40 million copies sold to date, and it features four top 10 singles. \"Rumors\" won the 1977 best album Grammy, and even 35 years later, it today remains remains the band's most successful effort, and ready to be shared with yet another generation.\n\nThese are the album tracks on the MP3 version here:\n\n1. Second Hand News (LP Version); 2:53\n2. Dreams (LP Version); 4:13\n3. Never Going Back Again (LP Version); 2:15\n4. Don't Stop (LP Version); 3:13\n5. Go Your Own Way (LP Version); 3:35\n6. Songbird (LP Version); 3:23\n7. The Chain (LP Version); 4:31\n8. You Make Loving Fun (LP Version); 3:29\n9. I Don't Want To Know (LP Version); 3:15\n10. Oh Daddy (LP Version); 3:57\n11.

The quality of the recordings in this MP3 version are excellent, and the carryover from the LP versions are excellent. Listen to the vocals and instrumentation and you'll see for yourself.\n\nFor newcomers to Fleetwood Mac, the group consisted of guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Buckingham, drummer Mick Fleetwood, keyboardist and vocalist Christine McVie, bassist John McVie, and vocalist Stevie Nicks. This was their eleventh studio album, and the recording sessions were marked by quite a bit of interpersonal strife between members of the group; and these experiences showed up in some of the album's lyrics. There are plenty of postings out there on the 'Net about the background behind this album, so I won't add to them here. Needless to say, \"Rumors\"  remains the group's most successful effort, and for many it's the best album they made.\n\nAs a side note, the front cover of album featured a stylized shot of drummer Mick Fleetwood and vocalist Stevie Nicks dressed in her \"Rhiannon\" stage persona. The photograph was taken by Herbert Worthington, a friend of Stevie Nicks for over 30 years, and he and Stevie have collaborated on thousands of her best photographs over the years.\n\nDiehard fans may want to check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Making-Rumours-The-Inside-Story-of-the-Classic-Fleetwood-Mac-Album\/dp\/B007AKBINQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Making Rumours: The Inside Story of the Classic Fleetwood Mac Album<\/a>&nbsp;by Ken Caillat, the album's co-producer.

And I was not disappointed at all. Though the tracks are not performed by the most famous orchestras still the performances are of fine quality and I enjoyed every track. there are a few songs I don't understand why they are considered creepy like mozart's requiem or the beethoven symphonies while others like the works by bach especially and most of the other tracks but musicwise they are all equal.

{"text":"Good question.  For starters, she isn't black and American. Old news. I know. But, unbelievably, I have been reading comments, here and there, asserting that this cannot be \"soul\" precisely because Amy isn't either. It is hard to fathom why some people cannot listen to and appreciate music for what emanates from the disc. Anyway, to the music.\n\nThere is so much that is positive about this record. The sound is crisp. The production is first-rate without ever getting in the way. The lyrics are sharp, funny and, at first listening, full of unexpected surprises. Winehouse's voice is vaguely familiar and is reminiscent of several others. However, when all is said and done, the voice is hers. It is undoubtedly one of the most impressive voices to come down the pike in several decades. Kate Bush, Elvis Costello, Dylan and the other Elvis come to mind. When you hear it you recognize it.  This is not just a copycat job. First, there was the jazzy Frank.  Now this soulful masterpiece.  What's up next, I wonder. The songs are just the right length. Not one song overstays its welcome, as is so often the case. Why is it that perfect little three minute songs have to run to over four and lose a lot in the process? This cd is comes in at the length of a longer LP. One side, flip, and then side two which ends appropriately after about forty-three minutes. Although there is a consistency that allows the cd to flow there is also sufficient variety to keep one's attention. The best cd's demand your attention. As one song concludes you await the commencement of the next one with excited anticipation. These records refuse to be background music. When those who are unfamiliar with the cd are in the room and the music is playing they invariably ask, somewhat embarrassed at their ignorance, \"who's this?\"  This is a special recording. If you ever liked soul music you need to get this.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I think Emanuel Ax has settled into routine playing as he's aged, but these are premiere Chopin interpretations from two decades ago. Now that Sony and BMG have merged their classical divisions, it's possible to issue Ax's excellent 1985 reading of the four Ballades--the best ever done by an American--with a 1988 recital of Mazurkas and the four Scherzi. The first recital was originally on RCA, the second on Sony. But just to confuse things a bit more, the readings here of Scherzos #2 and #4 are dropped in from an even earlier RCA recording.\n\nThe provenance won't matter that much to the general listener, who will be happy with the budget price for probably the best Chopin two-fer on the market. Begin listening with the four Ballades, where Ax is at his most impassioned and inspired. Even three years later, when he got to Scherzos #1 and #3, he had become more refined and relaxed, less a romantic risk-taker. He's remained that way ever since, but here at least we can hear Ax in his glory.  Faithful as I am to Pollini and Kisin in this repertoire, this collection often rises to their heights.\n\nP.S. 2011 - I returned to this CD recently, wondering if the rather uninspired music-making of Ax in later years indicated that I was mistaken about him early on. But I must say that his set of Ballades holds up next to the greatest I've ever heard. they are the definition of charismatic.","classification":5,"fold":5}
{"text":"It has honestly been very sad, whenever someone who is talented as a songstress, becomes so severely overexposed, that they are unfortunately a manufactured product than a real person. Sadly, Beyonce' Knowles is one of those singers who has been so severely overplayed, that her own voice has passed away in the process. Her music used to be popular, but now it has just became annoying. Her own work used to be popular in the 2000 decade when she released songs like Single Ladies and Crazy In Love. But honestly, the songs do not ignite, even when she made herself overflooded. Ego has been one of those songs that lags spirit, soul and voice badly. Beyonce' Knowles does not even come close from the heart. It feels more jaded, than any of the songs she did when she was a part of Destiny's Child. I think because Beyonce' Knowles has made so many bad and poorly made songs, that it is just time for her to retire.\n\nSong: F+","classification":1,"fold":5}

{"text":"Darlene sings a variety of genres on this album.  This album is enjoyable because of her ability to sing in different musical styles  She sings gospel songs like \"Marvelous\" and \"Jesus Is The Rock That Keeps Me Rolling\"  I am not a religious person, but these songs are very upbeat.  Darlene's voice has so much power on these two songs.  The piano playing sounds great on these tunes.  Darlene can also sing a rock song equally well. \"Little Liar\" is a rock song with  gritty guitar licks.  Darlene sounds strong vocally on \"Little Liar\" \"Sweet Freedom\" is not a rock or a gospel song, but I enjoy it very much. \"Sweet Freedom\" celebrates the freedom of a person after spending time in prison for a crime.  \"Sweet Freedom\" is a song that reminds me that redemption is possible for everyone.  \"Love Kept Us Fooling Around\" is just a sweet feel  good R and B love song.  I love the retro sixties tone of this song.  I really enjoy the duet that Darlene sings with Bill Medley on this album.  It is entitled \"Still Too Soon Too Know\".  I would classify this song as an easy listening song.  Bill Medley still has a smooth deep voice.  He accompanies Darlene nicely on this song.  I like the sax playing on this song. \"River Deep, Mountain High\" and \"Among The Believers\" are two songs that makes me believe that I can achieve anything.  Darlene has the kind of voice that motivates me to reach higher and try harder.  These two songs are proof of the power of her vocals.  \"Just Another Lonely Mile\" is a song that reaffirms my belief that true love exists. \"Night Closing In\" is a song that I can slow dance to with a special woman.  The sax and drums are played beautifully on this track.  I really enjoy this album.  I hope other listeners enjoy it too.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I always make this delineation when I listen to and review Gil Scott Heron, which is admittedly never enough: he had three distinct periods. His solo poetry proto-rap on albums like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Small-Talk-at-125th-and-Lenox\/dp\/B000005MLX\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Small Talk at 125th and Lenox<\/a>, the jazzy funk with jazz musician backing on early Flying Dutchman albums like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Pieces-of-a-Man\/dp\/B000005MLZ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pieces of a Man<\/a>, and the Midnight Band albums, which I feel is Heron's best work.\n\nI need look no further than First Moments Of A New Day to explain why I am Midnight partial. The Flying Dutchman material has many charms, but you always got the sense listening it was a poet backed by a band.\n\nTechnically, this is also true here. But like all the Midnight Band material, Heron's concepts are fully realized with a band that has jazz chops, but is more informed by rock and 1970s funk. The added backing vocals do not hurt---they give more of a musical backdrop to the poetry, and Heron here seems liberated to work as both a reciter AND singer.\n\nThis album works not because of the downplaying of the literary piece, but how it becomes a color in a funk jazz poetry protest painting.\n\nObviously, most of what Heron writes about is either outdated or does not now appear in the same way it did in the 1970s. But the fact that we are still buying ALL these albums show how well constructed they musically were.\n\nForget the poetry and the protest and the 1970s. As funk, right at  this 2010 second, you can't and won't beat this.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"This is a very fine Richard Thompson album. The man's a genius who has been writing great songs and playing superb music for decades now and this is a great addition to his already stellar canon.\n\nThompson's music is it's usual excellent self: good melodies, harmonically interesting and lyrically full of that carefree joi de vivre that always characterises Thompson's songs. :o) Seriously, a glance at the titles will give you a pretty strong clue that he's not deviating much from the sadness and anger which runs through so much of his work: Broken Doll; No Peace, No End; Where's Your Heart...you get the idea. And yet it never becomes depressing or over-bitter. The quality of the songwriting keeps it well above that level, and it's a fine album.\n\nThe performances and production are top-class, I think. Thompson is one of the great guitarists of our age and he's on fine form here - some fine guitar work while being quite understated and often quite far back in the mix. This works very well indeed, I think, and the band are all excellent.\n\nI loved Electric but I wasn't quite so taken with Acoustic Classics, although I can't quite put my finger on why. This is Thompson back to the peak of his form, I think: a classic Thompson album of fine songs, exceptionally well performed. It's always hard to tell for a while whether an album will turn out to be truly great as opposed to very good, but I think this may well be up there with Richard Thompson's very best - which is really saying something. Warmly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":5}

But when I heard the guy on the chorus I was thinking \"omg who is that?\" When you have it you have it and Bruno has it. I think this guy could sing about water and people would buy it just because of his voice. There are a select amount of artists who have such uniqeness like Keyshia Cole, Aretha Franklin, Tyrese, and Mary J Blige for example (off the top of my head). You know artists that you can identify just by their singin' voice. I think Bruno Mars is definitely one of those unique artists. What I love most is its actually him singin', no auto-tune, no enhancements. I just hope he doesn't become a victim of what they call fame. I've seen so many artists get completely destroyed by it.

{"text":"This is one of the best albums of Stevie Nicks career and that includes her work with Fleetwood Mac. It's excellent. However, Stevie Nicks is having several problems getting this album heard.\n\nFirst. Stevie is 66 years old. She has several singles on the album but they aren't going to get played because ageism is alive and well in the music industry. MTV and VH1 do not play videos from female singer songwriters over 45 on their stations. CMT won't play her videos because they think she is a witch, even though of couple of tunes on this album sound like country hits. She has no outlet for her music. Radio will not give these songs the attention they deserve. She is guilty of growing old.\n\nSecond, some fans are upset because they have spent years listening to the demos and can't get over them. I can't tell you how many fans have said she should of just had the demos remastered or they are upset because she decided to remake some demos and not others. Hence, they are downgrading the album based on that pettiness. They are also downgrading the album because critics who don't even like Stevie Nicks reluctantly like this album, but they didn't like the albums these so called fans liked. So they are trying to downgrade it based on that. Taste is also a factor and some of these whacked out people don't have any.\n\nThird, some critics and fans want her back with Fleetwood Mac ASAP and she has been reluctant to record a new record with them. So this record is getting downgraded for that reason, also, to teach her lesson.\n\nThere are more reasons.... However, none of them really have to do with the music.\n\nLike I said before - this album is excellent! There is not a bad song on the album and the album flows. It's not just a collection of singles. It's a real album that covers a lot of musical ground. It's the REAL DEAL. If you like good, classic rock music, then you will like this album. This is Stevie Nicks in her Hay Day!!!!!!! And keep in mind reviews with hidden agendas.","classification":5,"fold":5}

Previous finale song lyrics have been similar (\"Flying Without Wings\", \"magic rainbow\" from \"The Time Of My Life\", for example).\n\nAnd even though there wasn't a chance to pick from several contending songs this year (again, no surprise considering A.I.'s desire to promote new judge and songwriter Kara DioGuardi), \"No Boundaries\" is a surprisingly good fit for Kris Allen.  The producers of this recording made some wise decisions...keeping the arrangement simple with acoustic guitar being the focus, and including just enough strings and electric guitar to spice things up and give the song some power.  The harmony vocals really work to accentuate Kris' lead vocal, and the way Kris slides down to lower notes while holding out the 'boundaries' lyric sounds great and adds emotional impact.  All in all, a more-than-decent effort, especially considering the circumstances.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Papa Bell is cool. Its named after a Negro baseball player from nearly a century ago, led by bouncy island strings and like something from Graceland. The rest of the album is like something from Wasteland. That is to say that the decline of Paul Simon as a songwriter, which began after The Capeman; his best album as far as Im concerned; continues. Its as if hes forgotten how to make good songs, let alone more classics.\n\nHes still one of my favorite songers, but Id rather him retire than tarnish his legacy any further. Wristband is conceptually akin to The Afterlife from his last album and just as silly. Street Angel brings some interesting hip-hop effects, but structurally the song is a mess. The Werewolf is a grower, but In A Parade never stops sounding stupid. Two short interludes on an album barely over a half-hour long reek of laziness.\n\nHe sings of words and melody, but its the latter thats the problem. Paul Simon is still a wordsmith. Its the way he sings those words that, more than anything else, make his new songs mundane. The Capeman mustve robbed him. I can almost count on one hand the good songs hes released since then. Cool Papa Bell is one of them, yes, but good songs on a Paul Simon album are supposed to be the rule, not the exception.\n\nmarcellee.com","classification":2,"fold":5}

{"text":"My argument with the retro soul movement has always been somewhat the same: is it really necessary for R&B,soul and funk to remain living in the past? Well sometimes you can't fight a feeling so it's not important if the music reminds you of \"real instruments\" or \"something you grew up with\". Some types of sounds just effect you in a place that's beyond nostalgiac sentimentality. And that's definately the case with Sharon Jones & The Dap Kings. Apparently the now very much in limbo Amy Winehouse's backing band..well yes The Dap-Kings do rely very heavily on a very live and oriened sound and the in their case even the very sound of the PRODUCTION is retro,relying on at least the flavor of old sounding analog tape without any flattened digital quality. Lucky for us Sharon and the band are absolutely KICKING! Sharon herself has powerful,strong and soulful confidence that can at once be gentle and assured by a turn of note. She's focused very much on the nuances and tones of what she's singing as opposed to just loudly belting every note of a song because she can. I don't know anything about him but the bass player Bosco Mann is a KILLER! One important thing you'll notice about him especially on songs such as the title song,\"Better Things\",\"Give It Back\" and the lyrically potent \"Money (reminding us how much the state of the economy now echoes that of this music's past) is that aside from the fact these songs blend the distinct soul\/funk styles of Philly,Chicago and Memphis into a new mixture of flavors that Bosco's playing serves as a potent reminder to contemporary listeners the potentcy of a higher toned bass line,an element of the music usually associated now with a low,often aggresive tone. Curtis Mayfield used to use this a lot and so does Bosco and it really makes many of these songs. The stories this music tells from the spicy,mildly comedic \"lovers tale\" of \"Window Shopping\",the experiences of one person in a scary situation in \"She Ain't A Child No More\" and the blues styled lyric of \"Mama Don't Like My Man\" are again important reminders of,even though these lyrics could have easily fit into any soul tune from the 60's and early 70's they're still a vital part of the contemporary ideoms. So again have times really changed?Or is it more that they've had such an appearance of changing that we forget how similar things remain? Well the fact that everything hear from music,lyrics to the feeling expressed around those itself sounds both familiar and contemporary should provide at least....reference to an answer to that question.","classification":5,"fold":5}
{"text":"Oct 20, 2012\nAfter the last MK album - which I found to be sleep inducing - however many times times I tried to get involved with it, I thought long and hard about buying Privateering. The samples on Amazon held promise but now I have these two discs and have listened to them- I wished I 'd thought harder.  For the most part these are beautifully played and recorded and technically proficient songs - that lack any of the spark of a \"Donegan's Gone\" or \"Cannibals\".  Closest to anything with joy and feeling is \"Beanstalk\".  I should after 25 years shake off my conviction (? hope) that MK is ever going to do better than his output with Dire Straits. Sure artists have to grow - at least I didn't spring for the deluxe set.\nNov 8, 2012 - okay I retract most of the above review.

{"text":"Things got a little more upbeat following the downbeat For Sale. Also, the Beatles songcrafting improved and would set the pace for things to come. The title track has the same frantic quick-paced sound that made the title track to their first movie a hit. The theme of age reducing the cocksure assertive of one's younger years and the need for that helping hand is universal. And who can forget these lyrics: \"Help me if you can--I'm feeling down\/cause I do appreciate you being around\/Help me get my feet back on the ground\/Won't you pleeeeaaaase please help me?\" John gets good backing vocal help from Paul and George.\n\"The Night Before\" has a faint Chuck Berry influence. Paul sings here and it's a song of puzzlement, concerning a girl's nice and sincere behaviour and why she has done an about-face in attitude. That's John on electric piano.\nJohn sports a strained and sometimes roughened voice in the acoustic ballad \"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\". There's a flute solo by session musician Johnnie Scott in two places.\nThe distorted pedal guitar is cool in George Harrison's \"I Need You\". A similar effect was used in the song \"Yes It Is\", which is on Past Masters Volume 1. The theme of mistreatment explored in \"The Night Before\" is revisited here as well. He also sings the engaging \"You Like Me Too Much\", the first time he sings two songs on one album. This was a nominee for the movie, and understandbly so. He gets piano help from Paul, John, and producer George Martin.\nThe engaging \"Another Girl\" has Paul on lead vocals and lead guitar and might be a response to either of the two mistreatment songs: \"I have got another girl who will love me to the end, through thick and thin\/She will always be my friend.\" Well, that's a relief.\nIn the mid-paced \"You're Going To Lose That Girl\", John challenges another man that if he doesn't start treat her right, he himself will \"make a point of taking her away from you. Watch what you do. The way you treat her, what else can I do?\"\n\"Ticket To Ride\" opens with a nice Rickenbacker guitar by Paul before John launches into another breakup song. \"The girl's that'd driving me mad is going away. She's got a ticket to ride (X3) and she don't care.\" The first single from Help! and my second favourite here.\n\"Tell Me What You See\" has John and Paul on lead vocals, and when they sing, \"open up your eyes now\" Paul's lower register voice is clearly discernible.  \"I Have just Seen A Face\" has a racing guitar and sounds like something Simon and Garfunkel might do later, particular \"The Boxer\".\nThe reflective \"Yesterday\" is one of my all-time Beatles song and why Paul is my favourite vocalist of the quartet. It is the classic Paul McCartney ballad. Paul's use of a string quartet instead of what he called that \"Mahavishnu rubbish\" was a good move. Unforgettable lyrics: \"Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away, now it looks as if they're here to stay. Oh I believe in yesterday.\"\nThis the last album where they do cover tunes. Ringo does Buck Owen's \"Act Naturally\", a nice country-flavoured track. I often compare this to the similarly-sounding but production-laced \"Don't Pass Me By\" from the White album. John rips into the frantic Larry Williams number \"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\" in the same way he did \"Twist and Shout\". Nice mean guitar from George.\nIf the Beatles needed help on this album, I'd be hard-pressed to find it, because it's another bang-on job for them.","classification":5,"fold":5}

Until now, all these sets have just slapped together stray movements of pieces out of order. This one offers cohesive works in their entirety, from beginning to end.\n\nIf they could now go back to Beethoven and start over using this Vivaldi set as a model, that would be fantastic.\n\nAt the $2.99 \"Deal of the Day\" price on Oct 30, 2009, this is a great bargain. I think it would still be pretty good at the normal price too, and I don't usually say that. Highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Enough with the negative reviews on this cd. It's too different for the hardcore fans, etc., etc. It's too much like Christina Aguilera or Britany Spears, which is inaccurrate. You know, there was a time when a female artist could jump genres of music and receive accolades instead of dismissals. Olivia Newton-John, Tina Turner, Cher, Madonna, Annie Lennox, Sinead O'Connor--all were able to shift gears musically, and to me that's a sign of talent, not selling out. Sure, Jewel is finely airbrushed on the cover, the titles are written like Prince tunes (U & Me= Love, Run 2 U, Yes U Can), and the songs are polished to fine pop bliss. I, for one, find this cd to be one of Jewel's finest. She forgoes all the pseudo-serious folk preaching and gets down to business with a cd filled with upbeat tracks instead of her serious ballads. However, she is still writing about serious topics such as social issues in \"Stand\" and \"America\" along with other familiar themes of love such as \"Run 2 U\", \"Fragile Heart\" and \"2 Become 1\". She also deals with letting go and trying new things such as the first single \"Intuition\", which probably flew over most Jewel fans' heads. She even deals with lust on \"Sweet Temptation\", \"U & Me= Love\" and \"Yes U Can\". In fact, there are a number of hits on this disc: \"Stand\", \"Run 2 U\", \"Intuition\", \"Leave The Lights On\", \"2 Find U\", \"Fragile Heart\", \"Sweet Temptation\", \"Yes U Can\", \"America\" & \"Becoming\". The only true miss is the overlong \"Haunted\", which seemed out of place. This new direction is great--a breath of fresh air for Jewel. She sounds like she's having fun and the music represents that spirit. Too many reviewers are taking this cd too seriously. This could be Jewel's \"Thriller\" or \"Hysteria\" or \"No Jacket Required\". If you're looking for intelligent pop (which Aguilera and Spears are not), then pick this up (also if you like the 80's).","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"When I saw that Sony had made Michael Jackson the latest artist to be anthologized in their \"The Essential...\" series, I really was surprised to be honest, since the series never actually covers of this magnitude. I am compelled to say that they only compiled this collection because they wanted to cash in on the revived interest in his music after his \"not guilty\" verdict.\n\nIf this is indeed, the case, then it shouldn't really matter, since the two disc \"The Essential Michael Jackson\" is actually an affordabel and, for the mosr part, comprehensive collection for a person who only wants to own one Michael Jackson cd. Now, I do not have this cd. I already own the four disc boxed set and \"Thriller\" (all a fan needs, really), but I already own must of the songs, so I feel that I am qualified to write a review for it.\n\nIf you're the casual Jackson fan, you pretty much get all the stuff you need: the Jackson 5 hits (though \"I'll Be There\" and \"Dancing Machine\" are strangely omitted), early solo hits, later Jacksons recoridngs, and all the hits from his trifecta of best selling albums: \"Off The Wall\", \"Thriller\", \"Bad\" and \"Dangerous\". The hits from those album make up well over half the collection. You will also get two post 1992 recordings, the 1995 megahit \"You Are Not Alone\" and the 2001 Top Ten single \"You Rock My World\".\n\nAs with most if not all entries in the \"Essential\" series (as with most compilations), there are some problems. Judging by how many songs are on each discs, some tracks are bound to be edited. Most of these songs are the single versions that we're used to hearing, so we shouldn't really be bothered buy this, except that \"Thriller\" loses its magic without the long intro of the footsteps approaching the door, etc. Also, there are some tracks left off, such as \"I'll Be There\", \"I Wanna Be Where You Are\", \"Dancing Machine\", \"Ease On Down The Road\", the Paul McCartney \"Say, Say, Say\" (the only one of Michael's solo number ones to be omitted, though it may be because it was originally released on a Paul McCartney solo album rather than one of Michael's), \"State Of Shock\" (The Jacksons' collaboration with Mick Jagger) and the Janet Jackson duet scream. However as a whole, this collection will not disappoint, and is highly recommended for casual fans.","classification":4,"fold":5}

What really makes this all the more enjoyable now to listen to is the remastered 2015 version that has been released. It brings a whole new dimension to the sound and mood of \"Space Oddity\". You got to download and listen for yourself to see what I mean. I highly recommend adding this to your playlist.","classification":5,"fold":5}
{"text":"Of course I was drawn in to this album by the ear worm that is All About That Bass and I wanted to hear more from Meghan Trainor. After a couple of listens I was ho-hum about this album. There was not a track that I thought, \"Boy I can wait to hear that again,\" and there was not a track that I wouldn't listen to again. It is not going to be on any album of the year lists or win to many awards but as a just fun pop album it is an enjoyable listen. I could not listen to the album every day but once in a while it provides a good happiness boast. I am more interested to see what Trainor does as a follow up to this album. I do not think she will be a one album wonder by any means but I think she needs to be really pushed to write some more riveting music and leave the retro sound behind. Maybe she needs to seek out KatyPerry's management and see how, besides hard work, did she get out of under a possible career killer one hit like \"I Kissed A Girl\" to create the career she is enjoying currently.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"This is my favorite of Amy Winehouse's all-too-scant body of work. Watching her in the gossip columns was like watching the light of an oncoming train heading right for her. And her addiction was the train.  Of course, she was doomed. But we are doomed to having too little of her music, now and forever.\n\nHer edgy mix of Billie Holiday style growling blues, doo-wop and girl group bounce, along with her own modern twist is retro and yet completely modern. Like her sailor tattoos, you've seen them before, only--not Amy's way. I think my favorite song on the album is the title track \"Back to Black\"-- a song about rejection in a love affair that had no hope to begin with. For a month, I think I listened to it every night.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Strangely, this song seems to generate strong feelings of like\/dislike in people.  There were a number of people I knew who sort of wrinkled their nose at this particular recording, but it was some that  I read by Stephen King, of all people, lamenting (in absentia) to Marc Bolan - of \"T Rex\" (original recording artist) fame - that \"they\" were going to re-record his song, and that \"they\" were going to ruin it!  Well, I love most of Stephen King's writings, and have been a big fan since my teen years, but have to disagree with the other \"Stevie\" here.  \"They\" were \"Power Station,\" and \"They\" rocked the socks off of this tune, which, in my opinion, was originally a bit wimpy.\n\nThe cracking\/\"quacking,\" flat-out rockin' guitar work of Andy Taylor (yes, formerly of Duran Duran), and pounding, catchy rhythm of Tony Thompson (formerly of Chic) on drums, combined with John Taylor's (also formerly of Duran Duran) driving bass and Robert Palmer's soulful vocals, make for just plain good, hard, rock-and-roll!\n\nI remember being surprised at how much this song rocked, mainly because the guitarist and bassist came from a VERY pop-oriented (not rock really) band, the drummer from a former disco act, and the lead vocalist from what I considered to be mostly an \"Adult Contemporary\" set.  Pleasant surprise, if you like to open the sunroof, drop the top, or just roll down the windows on a warm sunny day and test out your ride's sound system!\n\nSadly, like Marc Bolan of T Rex, both Tony Thompson and Robert Palmer are since passed, but the tune lives on, whether you like the original (Stephen) or the re-make from the 80's (Steven).","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"California native Tyrese Gibson made his debut on, of all places, a Coca-Cola commercial. Oddly enough, that advertisement was the same thing that got him a recording contract. He signed with RCA Records to release his 1998 self-titled debut \"Tyrese\". While sales were slow initially, by the beginning of 1999, he had two huge hits under his belt: \"Sweet Lady\" (which was composed by a then-unknown Johnta Austin) and \"Lately\", which has since been covered by Anita Baker. 2001 saw the release of his second effort \"2000 Watts\" as well as a starring role in John Singleton's film \"Baby Boy\". That role led to another starring role in the franchise \"2 Fast 2 Furious\", while he also released another recording \"I Wanna Go There\". Despite his singing chops, he became in demand as an actor- appearing in films such as the military drama \"Annapolis\", the remake of \"Flight Of The Phoenix\" and another John Singleton film \"Four Brothers\". By the time he released the 2006 double disc \"Alter Ego\", he lost his passion for music and swore that it would be his last album. However, that turned out to be untrue- as he was constantly bombarded with questions of recording another album. In 2011, he returned with the underrated \"Open Invitation\" followed by the long-talked about TGT album \"Three Kings\" with Tank and Ginuwine.\n\nEven though his comeback did respectable numbers, in the end Tyrese just lost the passion and desire to record. Taking a cue from Kanye West on the recording of \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\", he wanted to make a bold artistic statement. Ironically, his best album would also turn out to be his last album \"Black Rose\". He is joined with longtime producer Brandon \"B.A.M.\" Alexander- who produced much of the album, as he previously did with \"Open Invitation\". Also along for the ride are Busta Rhymes protege Seige Monstracity (who produced the lamenting first single \"Dumb S**t\"), Tim & Bob, Rockwilder, Eric Hudson and Warryn Campbell, who produced the Jennifer Hudson backing \"Shame\". He sticks to being committed despite detractions from naysayers on \"Picture Perfect\" and duets with Chrisette Michele on \"Don't Wanna Be Alone\". Tank contributes background vocals on the ballad \"Prior To You\", while dealing with an abrupt breakup on \"Without My Heart\". He throws in a few sensual ballads for good measure (See: \"When We Make Love\", \"Gonna Give You What You Need\" and \"Body Language\")  before teaming up with Brandy on the song \"The Rest Of Our Lives\". Lastly, he closes the recording with the song about dealing with relationship troubles \"I Still Do\". \"Black Rose\" is a great album from Tyrese. It shows that he put his heart and soul into this album- sadly, we may never get another one like this from him.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"The quest to acquire all of \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's music continues... and brings me to his fourth studio album and one of the admitted \"low points\" of Al's career.  After the phenomenal success of his first three albums, it must have been a shock for Al's fans (as well as himself) for his fourth album to be a flop in comparison.  In fact, many critics and even Al himself believed \"Polka Party\" would be his swan song and mark the end of his career.  Nearly thirty years later, of course, we know that's not true, but all the same, this album is often highlighted as a \"valley\" in his career, and most of its songs have been largely forgotten (with at least one outrageous exception).\n\nAfter listening to this album, I'm inclined to agree with the critics -- while still fun, it's not Al's best, and while I enjoy a few of the songs, others are largely forgettable.\n\nAl is best known for his parodies, and they make up about half of this album.  Of said parodies, my favorite would have to be \"Addicted to Spuds,\" his parody of Robert Palmer's \"Addicted to Love.\"  Food songs are practically a tradition for him by now, and this number takes Palmer's energetic original and turns it into an ode to the tuber.  \"Living With a Hernia,\" a parody of James Brown's \"Living In America,\" isn't quite as fun in my opinion, but it's a nice tribute to the original and shows that Al's capable of taking on a wide variety of musical styles.  The other parodies include \"Here's Johnny\" (El DeBarge's \"Who's Johnny\"), a tribute to Ed McMahon of the Johnny Carson Show; \"Toothless People\" (Mick Jagger's \"Ruthless People\"), which sounds curiously uninspired and without much effort put into the lyrics; and his by-now-customary polka mix in the titular \"Polka Party,\" which includes samples from various hits such as \"Harlem Shuffle,\" \"Venus,\" \"Sussidio,\" \"Rock Me Amadeus,\" and \"Papa Don't Preach.\"\n\nThe originals are a mixed bag as well.  I didn't particularly care for \"Dog Eat Dog\" or \"Don't Wear Those Shoes,\" but I enjoyed the twangy country-western style of \"Good Enough For Now,\" as well as its hilarious lyrics that pay tribute to a \"just about average\" love interest.  \"One Of Those Days\" would have to be my favorite of the originals, as Al gripes about the various minor and major accidents and disasters that have befallen him today, ranging from losing a sock in the dryer to angry mobs burning crosses on his lawn -- and yes, it's the juxtaposition of the ridiculously major and hilariously minor disasters that make this song funny.\n\nThe most infamous number from this album would have to be \"Christmas At Ground Zero,\" the result of his record label requesting that he write a Christmas song -- you would really think that they would have learned their lesson about telling Al what to do from \"Girls Just Wanna Have Lunch.\"  A merry and jingly tune carries some of the most disturbing lyrics of all time, detailing a Christmas celebrated after the nuclear bombs drop and reduce the world to a radioactive wasteland... and to top it off, the song ends with an air raid siren.  Even before 9\/11 gave the term \"Ground Zero\" its far more tragic second meaning, it's a disturbing song... and yet weirdly hilarious at the same time.  Al may be goofy, but he also excels at black comedy.\n\nDefinitely not Al's best album, though a few hits do keep it from being a total wash.  If you're an Al completionist, go ahead and buy the album, but if you just want his best songs, I recommend you simply buy downloads of \"Addicted To Spuds\" and \"One Of Those Days,\" and maybe \"Christmas At Ground Zero\" if you don't mind some morbid humor.  Otherwise, save a full album purchase for \"Dare To Be Stupid\" or \"Mandatory Fun.\"","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"The title was taken from the bumping track \"Front, Back, & Side To Side\". I purchased an old The Source magazine from December 1994 and saw that was a track for one of their Sure Hot Singles back in the day. Thing was I never paid too much attention to UGK, except for a few songs here and there. Then ended up being the laughing stock at my job, because I told them that I'm from the A, their recent album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Underground-Kingz\/dp\/B000K7UFL2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Underground Kingz<\/a>&nbsp;was the only album I owned. So I ended up buying this the very next day.\n\nSuper Tight is a very southern style album. Both Bun B and Pimp C sound way different back in '94, than they do today. A lot of tracks would bump today as they did back then. \"It's Supposed To Bubble\" is one of them. Bun B drops a solo track \"Feds In Town\" which sounds real good. \"Pocket Full Of Stones 2\" and \"Protect & Serve\" are other good songs. \"Stoned Junkee\" is a very laid back and easy song to smoke to and features 3-2. The final track \"Three Sixteens\" featuring DJ DMD is a very good way to close out the album.\n\nSuper Tight is an excellent album. Some of the production sounds dated (although I have to give mad props to Pimp C for his production), but it still bumps here today. It's very unfortunate that this flew under the radar, especially when other albums from the south such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik\/dp\/B0000013GB\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Diary\/dp\/B000000W6Z\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Diary<\/a>&nbsp;dropped the same year. But if you're a fan of 90's southern rap (mainly groups like E.S.G., UGK, or anyone from Rap-A-Lot), don't hesitate to get this album.

{"text":"I was introduced to Amy Winehouse when her song, \"You Know I'm No Good\" was included on Ghostface's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/More-Fish\/dp\/B000JYWF6O\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">More Fish<\/a>&nbsp;CD, which was the 2nd CD Ghostface released in the year 2006, with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Fishscale\/dp\/B000E97HB2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fishscale<\/a>&nbsp;being the other.  The song had an old school feel to it and Ghostface was able to add his flavor to the track as well.  Now when I say old school, I don't mean 80s and 70s old school, but 60s old school.  I mean back when Diana Ross & The Supremes were standing strong on Motown with Holland, Dozier, Holland writing the songs.  Although, I liked the track, I hadn't heard anything else from Amy so I decided not to buy \"Back In Black\" when it was released earlier this year.  Once I heard the track \"Rehab\", which meant that I heard 2 tracks that I liked, I decided to change my way of thinking.  However, once I bought \"Back To Black\" the CD stayed in the wrapper for atleast 2 months.  Finally, once I was tired of just hearing \"Rehab\" on the radio and watching the video on VH1 Soul.  I decided to put the CD in my stereo to see what the rest of Amy's CD sounds like.  I am glad that I finally made that decision.\n\nSince I had already heard \"Rehab\" and \"You Know I'm No Good\" a combined total of 239 times, I decided to start at track 3, which is \"Me And Mr. Jones\".  Amy wastes no time letting you know that she is unhappy with what her man did to her as she is highly upset that she missed the Slick Rick concert.  While she is mad, she also informs her man that should this continue that there will be no reason for her and Mr. Jones to carry on whatever they were doing.  Just as her 2 singles did, Amy brings back a sound that I am sure that my parents heard before I was even thought about being created.  (I was born in '75)  On \"Just Friends\" Amy does the same but this time there's a reggae feel to the track as well.  Amy seems to be involved with a man that already has someone else, but she is being considerate this time around, unlike the way she was on \"You Know I'm No Good\".  The title track is simply phenominal.  I don't even know what to label this song or how to come up with the type of words to tell you how good this song is.  I am not sure what her state of mind was when Amy and Mark Ronson came up with the ideas for this track but it works.  Amy starts the song off with her and her lover doing what they do best and him starting to have regrets about it.  They obviously had more in common than just being with each other because they also had similar \"hobbies\" as she states how he had his favorite drug of choice and she had hers.  The courtship gets to a point where he realizes that he has to go back to Woman #1 which means Amy will no longer be Woman #2.  The song has Amy thinking about what she will be going back to if he really means that the courtship is over.  Amy may never pass a code of ethics exam, but the formula for the track works.  \"Love Is A Losing Game\" finds Amy at a point where she is talking about being disappointed about being in love and the situation not working out in the end.  Whether it was a boyfriend, a forbidden lover or a friend she is just tired of falling in love with someone and the situation not working out.  \"Tears Dry Out On Their Own\" falls right along those lines as well.  However, in this case it appears to be a relationship that was atleast substantial in some way, form or fashion.  This track is actually the current single and the video is nice as well.  \"Wake Up Alone\" seems to take place where Amy would be if the man in her substantial relationship actually did leave and what she would be doing.  You get a sense of that because she mentions that she isn't drinking, which was the reason why he left since she didn't want to go to \"Rehab\".  \"Some Unholy War\" has Amy telling us how she would feel if her man was fighting in a war for an unworthy cause such as the war in Iraq.  She would stand by him, but she finds herself defeated in some ways because she feels he is basically fighting for no reason.  \"He Can Only Hold Her\" sounds familiar to me only because John Legend used the same sample on a track entitled \"Slow Dance\" that appears on his 2nd CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Once-Again\/dp\/B000HCPWZO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Once Again<\/a>.  Although, the track appears to be upbeat, it seems to hold a deeper meaning.  It seems as if the woman in question went through a traumatic experience and although her man is trying to be in her life and to have her heart that isn't possible because of this bad experience that she had in the past.  Track 11 is \"You Know I'n No Good\" with Ghostface's verse included in the track, where track 2 doesn't include Ghostface's rap.\n\nClocking in at barely over 36 minutes, I would normally be discouraged by the length of the CD.  However, Amy Winehouse, Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi definitely have a good thing going here and I am not disappointed at all.  Some people will be discouraged because of Amy's subject matter and the events that she usually talks about in her songs but good music is good music.  One good thing about old school music is that the artist isn't afraid to tackle serious issues whether it's something that they are going through personally or if it's something that's happening in the world.  Amy isn't afraid to say what's on her mind and the musical arrangements and production behind those words are outstanding.  I will definitely grab&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Frank\/dp\/B000PKG7I4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Frank<\/a>&nbsp;on the day it is supposed to be released, which is November 13th, 2007.  If you are into any form of old school music and you can stomatch the subject matter then \"Back To Black\" should be a welcome addition to your collection.\n\nJames' Top 5\n\n1) Back To Black\n2) Rehab\n3) Tears Dry On Their Own\n4) You Know I'm No Good\n5) Love Is A Losing Game\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\nThe Rest Of The CD (All the songs are nice)","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I knew this was RedOne behind the board here, man... I just KNEW it. It's getting to seem like everything truly excellent (and new) in production these days is coming from RedOne -- and his creativity behind the board is on full display, here. RedOne isn't playing around anymore, that much is for sure: he's hunting for some monumentally massive numbers within the industry, and by the sound of this, he's going to get them.\n\nRandom thoughts:\n\n1. I love the atmospherics \"pushing\" the song here. Long a feature in Euro-trance, I have wondered for ages when somebody would grab the concept and knock a single out of the ballpark with it on the US chart. Call this \"propulsive house\" if you like, but there's a bit of \"propulsive mariachi\" at work here as well, if you ask me. I don't know if there's even such a thing as \"propulsive mariachi,\" but if there is, then THIS is what it sounds like; I honestly thought this might break into 9\/10th's time and go into a \"flamenco house\" at the break (there's no such thing as THAT either, but hey, feel free to sue me if it makes you feel any better). Using the synths as practically a separate drum track is LONG-overdue for use in a mass-market US single; this really should have preceded ON THE FLOOR in the initial push at radio for the album (it is slower, though... my ears have it at 120 BPM, while ON THE FLOOR strikes me as 130-ish (BPM)). I can kinda tell that you wanted to use higher-pitched tones for the bass-line here, while using the low end for traditionally higher-pitched melodic elements -- but I'll be damned if I can point to just where I think I hear that. One of these days you're gonna reverse them for real, and it's gonna be a MONSTER in club-land.\n\n2. Lopez's voice here is in fine form -- she sounds, to me, sharper... almost as if she's naturally in F (which she ain't). A part of that, of course, comes from the contrast against the key used here: my ears have this in E (minor), so Lopez here sounds sharper (by comparison); still, what I think I hear from her does sound true -- i.e., it wasn't done electronically... she does, simply, sound better... is what I'm trying to say. The vox here are sharp, energetic, and focused. RedOne is not only an Einstein behind the board, but he also gets the best, vocally, from Lopez (in my opinion, anyhow) in a good long while.\n\n3. All the usual good stuff applies, here: it's totally club-ready as-is, ringtones galore can be heard within it, and the re-mix potential is BEYOND massive. The (rapidly growing) Latin market is properly nailed (singing a few lines in Spanish towards the end feels absolutely correct), while the record still maintains a solidly mainstream US focii. I love the mariachi-sounding keys... and yeah, I know I already said that. The hook is ROYAL, man... the chorus is an instant earworm. The final result is MAJESTIC.\n\nProps, RedOne.\n\nYou brought out the best from the talent in front of you, and it's really a truly exceptional record. This is what a producer is supposed to be, folks: RedOne, YOU TOOK LOPEZ TO A PLACE WHERE SHE EXCEEDED HERSELF.\n\n5 stars, all around.\n\nSimply beyond massive.","classification":5,"fold":5}

After listening to each song on this album the soothing vocals, music and lyrics he has establish a following with me along with other fans because is breath of Fresh Air from the  Music Mainstream.  If you like new comer John Legend, Kem is Several notch better than John Legend.  Just vocally and lyrically, Kem is a fore runner and his record company should spend lots more money marketing him. His life story Kem should be a Movie.  It amazing what God when you let him put his destiny for you and how when you tapped into your God Destiny and Purpose what Radiants witnin a person talent and abilities.  This album is a good showcase.\n\nMy  Personal Favorite song is Love Calls,  this by itself establish his prescence in the music industry.  I have rated each song. Other favorites\n\n1.

I also remember first hearing this song back in 2005 when I was waking up to my alarm clock radio for work and was still getting familiar with the local radio stations as it was less than a month after I started living in Florida (via the navy). Anyhow, from my modest perspective, Come Sail Away by Styx is a classic rock song that embodies a positive sense of getting away from the challenges and dramas of life via a healthy sense of fun (such as an outdoor outing, taking a walk outside, going out somewhere fun and\/or therapeutic with someone you enjoy hanging out with etc. Im guessing Sail Away by Styx could also obviously point to the recreational sense of sailing.

{"text":"I'm going to start my review off by saying I didn't get my copy through Amazon.  When I went to preorder, it wasn't available for preorder on Amazon at that time.  As I have already reviewed We are Love on Amazon, I'm only going to review the five amazing new songs.  Angel, that Sarah MacLaughlan had originally sung, was so beautiful and it brought tears to my eyes.  Little Things, a One Direction song, was a pleasant surprise.  I am not a fan of boy band music at all but the boys brought power and passion to the song and made me love it.  Can You Feel the Love Tonight, the famous song from the movie The Lion King, lyrics by Tim Rice, music by Elton John, has always been one of my favorite movie songs.  The boys brought their trademark passion and power to it and made it magical.  Surrender (Torna a Surriento), a brilliant blend of Elvis' Surrender and the Italian Torna a Surriento, is my favorite song of the new songs.  Right away, Gianluca, the baritone, blew me away with his impeccable vocal that gets better every time I hear him sing.  You can just feel the emotion and passion emanating from him when he sings.  Piero also blew me away with his classical\/operatic voice that gets better and better every time he sings.  Ignazio was incredible as well.  Maria, from West Side Story, is usually sung as a solo.  Gianluca had sung it during their last tour as a solo song.  The boys each had a solo part in the song as well as singing together.  It was an interesting arrangement that surprisingly worked and quite effectively.  Il Volo, with these five new brilliant tracks, have proved to all of us that they can sing anything and sing it with the utmost passion, and, of course, with the utmost power.  Congratulations, guys!  Keep the great songs coming!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I love this song too, I found an interesting article about the song's title.  The Japanese title \"Ue o muite arukou\" means \"I look up when I walk\", a Japanese saying that means, roughly, though I'm sad I'm NOT defeated, I'm smiling through my tears.  Record company officials thought that wouldn't compute with English speakers, so they picked a Japanese dish popular in the Western world, no connection to the song!\n\nI found another version of this song I like VERY much:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ue-o-muite-aruko-sukiyaki\/dp\/B0049XJMRQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ue o muite aruko (sukiyaki)<\/a>&nbsp;, by Sweet Sister Pain.  It's WAY different, so purists won't like it, but those who thrive on variety\/variation may.  I think it's lush, beautiful, complements the original.\n\nThe lyrics:\n\nI look up when I walk\nSo that the tears won't fall\nRemembering those spring days\nBut I am all alone tonight\n\nI look up when I walk\nCounting the stars with tearful eyes\nRemembering those summer days\nBut I am all alone tonight\n\nHappiness lies beyond the clouds\nHappiness lies above the sky\n\nI look up when I walk\nSo that the tears won't fall\nThough the tears well up as I walk\nFor tonight I am all alone\n(Whistling)\n\nRemembering those autumn days\nBut I am all alone tonight\n\nSadness lies in the shadow of the stars\nSadness lurks in the shadow of the moon\n\nI look up as I walk\nSo that the tears won't fall\nThough the tears well up as I walk\nFor tonight I am all alone\n(Whistling)\n\n[Translated by Namiko Abe on About dot com.]","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Its rare that I review a soundtrack without having seen the underlying film. The Ghostbusters remake\/reboot (featuring the all-female lead cast) came out in theaters yesterday (technically on Thursday, as it is the new Friday), and I am on the fence whether I will go see it. But also today is the release of the new movies soundtrack, and on that I can tell you that I am ALL IN.\n\nGhostbusters  Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (14 tracks; 46 min.) opens with the 2016 remake of the original theme song, brought by none other than Walk the Moon. The remake is updated just enough that it sounds fresh and contemporary, yet isn't so far removed that it becomes unrecognizable. In other words: a great job by WTM (plus singer Nicholas Petricca sounds uncannily like Ray Parker Jr.) . The same cant be said of the interpretation called Ghostbusters (Im Not Afraid), by Fall Aout Boy (feat. Missy Elliot). I find this version just off-putting. Much better is the beautiful and light-hearted and mostly a-cappella version by Pentatonix. And just to make sure that you remember which movie soundtrack you are listening to, the album closes with the original 1985 version from Ray Parker Jr. Yes! that makes in total 4 versions of the same song on here. As to the other songs, for me by far the best is Ghoster, a new track by up-and-coming indie UK band Wolf Alice. The song is short, but packs a wallop, courtesy of lead singer Ellie Rowsells powerful vocals. Short and sweet indeed. Another choice addition is Good Girls, a new track from Elle King, here in top ;girl empowerment form! (I saw her in concert last month, and she blew me awayin the best possible way.) Another truly noteworthy contribution is Get Ghost, also new and written specifically for the movie, by Mark Ronson, Passion Pit & A$AP Ferg, an irresistible dance-along tune. Since I haven't seen the movie, I have no idea how all these songs are used, whether they appear extensively or just in snippets, etc. But here it all sounds quite good, and this collection of mostly fun and upbeat songs is perfect for the summer. (Please note that separately from this, Amazon also has the original motion picture score, by veteran Hollywood composer Theodore Shapiro.)\n\nBottom line: whether the movie remake\/reboot is any good is almost beside the point, certainly as it relates to this soundtrack. Sure, not all the songs are masterpieces and some even misfire (FOB), but there is enough new and original music on here that works great, and several of remakes (by WTM and Pentatonix) work very nicely. Bottom line: the jury may still be out on Ghostbusters the movie, but Ghostbusters the soundtrack is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":5}

This is the one to own however since it captures all of his big hits and well represents my two favorite albums \"Off The Wall\" and \"Thriller\". His best songs are all here\" Rock With You, Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, Beat It, Billie Jean,The Girl Is Mine, Human Nature, etc. as well as his early hits with the Jackson Five and the great later albums like \"Bad\" and \"Dangerous\". THIS IS THE BEST SOUNDING representation of these hits I have ever heard. There are 37 cuts. Michael was indeed an American tragedy and a pop music icon. If you can only own one CD, this is the most logical choice. My only quibble is the omission of \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" which was my favorite Jackson Five song. At one time, he was selling over one million albums-CD's a day (1983-84). He changed the course of pop music history and his legacy will live on despite the cynics.

Her debut single, I Kissed A Girl from her debut album One Of The Boys, is one of the most displeasing songs I've ever heard this past year. She really feels like she is trying to be more like flavor of the moment, and sadly she wrecks her chance at the beginning. I really think she needs to really reinvent herself, if she wants to as good as acts like K.T. Tunstall, or even the tabloid drama Queen, Amy Winehouse.

His pianist stylists are somewhere between Bill Evans and a quiet dive bar's lonely player.

{"text":"Slaughterhouse releases their second album \"Welcome To: Our House\" on shady Records. Their first album was self titled (slaughterhouse)was released in 2009 and it received good reviews from fans and critics, even though they said it was recorded in a week. So everybody is wondering will their Shady debut be better than the first one, well lets see...\n\nI'll give a quick track by track breakdown of the standard edition\n\n1. \"The Slaughter\" (Intro)\n\n2. \"Our House\" (featuring Eminem and Skylar Grey) Here we go, slaughterhouses first track to the mainstream world and Joe budden isn't on the track but Em is? Matter of fact Joe does have two lines.. the loud Skylar Grey hook was very annoying but the verses was dope.\n\n3. \"Coffin\" (featuring Busta Rhymes)Bussa Bus does a good job on the high energy hook, and Slaughterhouse does what they do best and that spit fire! This one of the songs you can outwork to.\n\n4. \"Throw That\" (featuring Eminem)This song sounds so awkward and forced, as this is for the strip clubs... The hook is atrocious as Em says \"I'll throw this d*** on you girl\" and \"This whole building is probably filled with lil ding-a-lings\".\n\n5. \"Hammer Dance\" The first single produced by AraabMuzik, y'all should already know about this song. One of my fav songs on here.\n\n6. \"Get Up\" No I.D. supplies a dope beat while Slaughterhouse tells you how they won't lose. They were trying to make a statement with this song and they did.\n\n7. \"My Life\" (featuring Cee Lo Green) I'm not gonna lie I hated this song at first, it felt like leftover track from Ems recovery album..but after giving it a few more listens it definitely grew on me. This was the their crossover song that should of been as big as Bad Meets Evils \"Lighters\" song, but nonetheless lyrically they are still on point. Great song\n\n8. \"We Did It\" (Skit)\n\n9. \"Flip a Bird\" The title explains the track perfectly, basically the song is about drugs. If rap don't work they will sell drugs if they have to.\n\n10. \"Throw It Away\" (featuring Swizz Beatz)The third single, I hated this track the first time I heard it but after seeing the video and giving it more listens I actually like it now.\n\n11. \"Rescue Me\" (featuring Skylar Grey) Skylar shows up for a second time I like this better than the other song shes on, this track is dope and Alex Da Kid supplies a sick head nodding beat. One thing I noticed was Crooked I was rapping exactly like em, he even altered his voice to sound like him...that was kinda weird\n\n12. \"Frat House\"  Royce & Crooked I have their own verse while Joe & Joell share the third as they use College refenrces which was cool. This is another on my fav tracks on here.\n\n13. \"Goodbye\" Heartfelt track where they talk about family members they lost. Joe talks about his twins, Crooked talks about his Uncle and Joell talks about his Grandmother. This is a song to check for.\n\n14. \"Park It Sideways\"  This track is produced by Kane Beatz, and its obviously aimed for the radio.... when the beat gets to the hook it sounds similar to Lil Waynes \"Right Above It\" beat. The crazy thing about this song is on the hook they say \"we got this b**** bumpin like a bug bite\" I wasn't really feeling this track\n\n15. \"Die\" Joell is absent on this track, Joe Buddens definitely had the standout verse, but Royce & Crook are still spitting dope verses. This song is cool.\n\n16. \"Our Way\" (Outro)Basically a celebrating track, to sum it all up they made it. This song was ok, nothing special\n\nOverall the album solid but I still feel it didn't meet expectations... you have Slaughterhouse and Eminem, that's 5 lyrical giants right there and the songs they collaborated together on was underwhelming. The problem with this album is the pop singles and  hooks, which are really cheesy. I don't even care that they made radio songs cause some of my fav songs are mainstream, its just the fact that the \"Pop\" songs they made were not good. Other than a few songs, it seems like they had no creative control over this album whatsoever. The same thing happened to Yelawolf when he released \"Radioactive\". Hopefully the next album they release is more focused and less forced. I think the first album is better than this one, but you should atleast check the album out. The album isn't terrible by any means, but it isn't great either. I give it a 3.5 out of 5 its a solid album","classification":4,"fold":5}

This came at the right time, it was one of the flavors that fit my musical appetite this time last year. \"Swing Thing\" became part of a playlist that I played to death. This track provided a counterbalance to the core of the playlist, things like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Beats-Antique\/dp\/B0014ZL0LS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Beats Antique<\/a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Del-Reys\/dp\/B003BSAQ4I\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Del-Reys<\/a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Parov-Stelar\/dp\/B000QWY9JA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Parov Stelar<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Oojami\/dp\/B000QLDANM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Oojami<\/a>.\n\nListening to the samples across the album's tracks there are some interesting things going on, some enjoyable percussion, some modern incarnations of swing music. The obstacle for me was that the heavily produced sweetness of this track and the act's sound overall remind me of recordings like Roman Holliday's \"Stand By\", Oxo's \"Whirly Girl\" or even Wham. I'm hoping they take this foundation and on the next album roughen things up a bit, and lighten the heavy production on the vocals. I don't mean mimic the ragged harmonies of the Stones, but I'm looking forward to hearing development that expands beyond the automated sound. I really like what Joe Jackson has done with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Duke-Ellington-s-standard-Caravan\/dp\/B008BHGOGI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Duke Ellington's standard, \"Caravan\"<\/a>, that's one you can really crank up in the car.\n\nIf you like what you hear, Amazon has another free promotional track from 11 Acorn Lane,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mazinka\/dp\/B003XIVVK4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mazinka<\/a>.\n\nUpdate: Check out this album's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Let-It-All-Hang-Out\/dp\/B005OK0J9S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Let It All Hang Out<\/a>.

It almost looks as though the \"Swing Thing\" album may be a compilation of tracks from these earlier sources. On these other albums the group delves into gypsy, French lounge and a broader array of swing era styles. I'm happy to say that apart from a song or two, none of it sounds like Roman Holliday, and there are quite a number of candidates for the next playlist.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"We do not really think of Simon & Garfunkel as being a folk group, mainly because when \"The Sounds of Silence\" became a big hit and a signature song of the 1960s it had been electrified. But when you listen to their first album, \"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.,\" it becomes clear from the opening track, \"You Can Tell the World,\" that they were a folk duo. Of course there is the obligatory Dylan song, \"The Times They Are-A Changin',\" Sixties songs like \"Last Night I had the Strangest Dream,\" and traditional songs like \"Go Tell It On the Mountain\" to add to the folk song bona fides of the album.\n\nIn retrospect what is interesting is Paul Simon's attempt to write folk songs, a category into which \"The Sounds of Silence\" does not fall. Of those original songs, \"He Was My Brother\" is the one most in keeping with the spirit of the Sixties, while \"Bleecker Street\" evinces the delicate music he could write. But Simon is still learning his craft, as evidenced by \"Sparrow,\" which tends to be a bit pretentious. Then there is Simon & Garfunkle's rendition of the traditional song \"Benedictus,\" which gets a bit electrified as well. There is a real sense that the duo are still learning their craft and just beginning to find the sound that would define them.\n\nIn addition to be digitally remastered, this version of \"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. includes a trio of bonus tracks, which consist of bare boned demo version of Simon's \"Bleecker Street\" and alternate takes of his \"He Was My Brother\" and the cover of \"The Sun is Burning.\" But even with those additions this remains an interesting but not great debut album by a duo that would continue to improve with each and every album they put out until they reached the pinnacle with \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" and then called it quits when they were literally on top of the music world.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"It has been 5 years since Dido Armstrong put out her 3rd studio album Safe Trip Home(2008). During that term, Dido took a rest from the public eye and constant touring; she took advantage of this sabbatical to get married and become a mother. Yes, she has been away for a while trying to search for some good inspiration. Now, in 2013, Dido returns with this album produced with her brother Rollo Armstrong, Brian Eno and Dido herself that put her back on the spotlight. Girl Who Got Away is probably her most mature album ever, which reflects her new role as a housewife and mother. However, the album follows the same formula as on No Angel, Life for Rent and Safe Trip Home, which makes me think that musically speaking, Dido got stuck somewhere in between 1999 and 2008. Lyrically speaking, she has matured very much, inspired by her recent marriage and birth of her daughter. The major strengths on this CD: No Freedom, Girl Who Got Away, Let Us Move On, Blackbird, End of The Night , Love To Blame, Go Dreaming. The slightly weak tracks: Sitting In The Roof of The World, Happy New Year and Loveless Heart. The CD is a Limited Edition that includes 7 extra tracks with the Alternate version of Let Us Move On, All I See and Everything To Lose as highlights. Overall, it is a good CD with a few weak moments. Dido is slightly back and we all hope to listen from her very often. She needs to make a much improved album. So, this CD is a nice return to her songwriting and composing duties.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"With the press release for her latest album, \"600 Years In A Moment,\" heralding it as \"her most epic and significant album,\" I was of course very much looking forward to it. And after hearing it in detail, I have to say that it definitely lives up to that lofty accolade. \"600 Years in a Moment\" was recorded using a unique contemporary piano crafted in Australia along with ancient instruments from around the world.  Fiona's concept is to bring instruments and their distinctive sounds from villages across the globe to explore the hidden musical treasures of cultures in a modern musical setting. The album is eclectic, acoustic, beautifully produced, and spans genres with influences of new age, jazz, classical, and world music, with the distinctly Celtic flavor of her ancestors. In addition to piano, Fiona also adds vocals on the album and has often been told that she sounds like an \"Australian Enya.\" A number of the songs begin with solo piano before being joined by other instruments and I appreciated that it provided a contrast and an opportunity to experience Fiona's playing and melodic sensibilities on their own before flowing into a collective musical pool.\n\nReading the list of accompanists and instruments on the various songs, it might seem like the tracks could be rather busy, but everything is expertly mixed with just the right amount of subtlety to allow Fiona's graceful piano to shine, while still providing melodic and textural support. \"600 Years In A Moment\" is a masterful mlange of superlative musical performance, stunning contemporary composition, and widely diversified cultural influences. Preceded by a string of award winning and critically acclaimed recordings, Fiona Joy Hawkins has outdone herself with this release and continues to set the bar ever higher in the unfolding of her creative potential.","classification":5,"fold":5}
{"text":"Bypassing the illusion of distance\nCome back into your house\nIt was expecting you always\n\n\"600 Years in a Moment\" is a musical prayer. This music is a return to the past and a look into the future. The new album of Fiona Joy Hawkins is a real treasure.\n\nThe nature of her music is very feminine. It is filled with the celtic flavor of her ancestors. And it brings a special charm to Fiona's music. But the artist goes deeper and includes musical traditions and ancient instruments from around the world.\n\nThe album \"600 Years in a Moment\" was recorded using a unique Australian Stuart & Sons piano. Its perfect and heartfelt sounding helps to unite all parts of the various instruments into a single whole.\n\n\"600 Years in a Moment\" is an endless ocean of pure emotions. The tunes easily flow and all of them are full of the passion of artist's heart.  All arrangements are perfect. And this is not accidental because two musical sorcerers William Ackerman and Corin Nelsen helped Fiona produce this album.\n\nThe time flies swiftly when listening to this album. Many ages and musical traditions are carried out before your eyes merging into one divine melody. When all sounds subside, only infinite love and beauty remain. And your heart will be open and receptive, and therefore alive.\n\nBut all of the above mentioned features of the album \"600 Years in a Moment\" are insignificant compared to one. You will understand this music without fail because Fiona Joy Hawkins speaks the most understandable language - the language of love.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Silver-toned Ed Brown's 50 year news reporting career included stints at WMCA-570 AM and WNEW-1130 AM in NYC and for the RKO and NBC radio networks. He retired in 1997 after some years at WCHL-1360, in Chapel Hill, NC.\n\nFounded in 1925 as a 5,000 watt station at the top of the AM dial, by 1960 WMCA adopted their successful \"Good Guys\" Top 40 format. Despite competition from 50,000 watt clear channel WABC-770, 'MCA was NYC's ratings champ from 1963 through '66. By 1970, they transitioned to an all talk format called \"Dial-Log Radio.\"\n\nNYC's PREMIER ALBUMS was founded in 1959 as a budget operation with such labels as CORONET and SPIN-O-RAMA. In 1965, Premier bought out Philly-based CAMEO\/PARKWAY. Their JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY - A MEMORIAL ALBUM (#2099) is fine-quality: a substantial disc with good audio. The record reproduces in full a one-hour show narrated by Brown and broadcast over WMCA on the day of JFK's murder, 11\/22\/63. All but two speeches selected are excerpts.\n\nThe LP's back cover has the memorial service eulogy given by Cardinal Richard Cushing of Massachusetts, and the lying in state remarks of House Speaker John McCormack (of Boston), Chief Justice Earl Warren (former Gov. of CA.) and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (of MT.). Mansfield's comments were briefest, but also the most moving:\n\n\"There was a sound of laughter; in a moment, it\nwas no more. And so she took a ring from her finger\nand placed it in his hands.\nThere was a husband who asked much and gave much,\nand out of the giving and the asking wove with a\nwoman what could not be broken in life, and in a\nmoment it was no more. And so she took a ring from\nher finger and placed it in his hands, and kissed him\nand closed the lid of a coffin.\nA piece of each of us died at that moment. Yet, in\ndeath he gave of himself to us. He gave us of a good\nheart from which the laughter came. He gave us of a\nprofound wit, from which a great leadership emerged.\"\n\nSIDE ONE\n[21:20] Oath of Office (1\/20\/61); Campaign speech on being Catholic; \"New Frontier\" acceptance speech, 1960  Democratic Convention, L.A.; First Nixon-Kennedy Debate; Inaugural Address, unedited (1\/20\/61)\n\nSIDE TWO\n[27:10] West Berlin and the dangers of Communism's expansion (Alliance For Progress); U.S. Steel price increases (spring '62); Cuban Missile Crisis TV speech, conclusion (Oct.

There wasn't a pop, soul, or even jazz station that was not playing it in regular rotation.  It rocketed Robert to instant stardom and her voice became one of the most recognizable ballad singers of the 70's.  One listen and you know there was a subtle and beautiful power there.  Modern soul\/R&B singers have not a clue as to how to command a vocal like this.  Now it is all about \"runs\" and unrestrained power.  Take a lesson everone, this is how you deliver a beautiful ballad.  If you want more, lay your ears on her cover of The Three Degrees \"Trade Winds\" another Roberta Flack hit that utilizes gorgeous vocal delivery, subtle jazz and soul instrumentation, and a slow burn to building crescendo.

{"text":"A great number of the instrumentalists I write about, and pianists in particular, tell of years of study, private lessons, music academies and conservatories, and the like. It's not as often that I hear a pianist who has reached an extremely high level of proficiency with no formal training and being completely self-taught. However, Michele McLaughlin is one of them. In her words: \"I just learned to play by listening to other musicians, and it wasn't long before I was composing my own songs.\" Now 15 albums later, Michele is a well-recognized artist in the new age solo piano world and has become an in-demand performer.\n\nSpeaking about being a prolific performer, the opening track, \"11,000 Miles,\" about her 30 shows in 26 states tour, over a period of two months is a perfect example. This song makes a wonderful opening piece for the album and totally captures the sense of fun and adventure that Michele described in the liner notes. It is lively and upbeat with a rolling-down-the-highway feel to it. This being the first song of Michele's that I heard, I must say that my response was a big \"wow!\" The thought that kept coming up for me was: \"I cant' believe this person is self-taught!\" Her dexterity is notable and I was quite impressed with the composition itself, and particularly with some of unusual and unexpected chord changes she used.\n\nI greatly appreciated that Michele included liner notes, which gave a brief description of the inspiration behind each song. A good example was \"Changing Skies.\" That imagery came to life in my mind's eye as I listened to the composition in peaceful reverie. Another remarkable aspect of Michele's playing is emotional spectrum she is capable of revealing in her music from one piece to the next. A case in point was the effortless shift from the gentle warm-hearted \"Full Of Love\" to the more pensive and wistful \"The Space Between,\" which follows it.\n\nMichele enters some deep and thoughtful emotional terrain on the album's title track. This piece digs deep below the surface to uncover subterranean emotions, sometimes quite intense, as in the middle section. While it doesn't reflect the sunny ambience of some of her other music, it truly highlights Michele's talents as a composer and pianist. \"Undercurrent\" provides a rich and rewarding listening experience from a stellar artist who truly deserves all the acclaim she has been receiving. I have no doubt that Michele McLaughlin is someone we will be hearing more about as she builds a legacy with each successive release.","classification":5,"fold":5}

After a few dissapointing songs from I Am Sasha Fierce, it is hard to tell if she can really pull it off. That unfortunately is not the case with her latest single, Sweet Dreams, the 6th single from the album. The song tries going into a more dance rhythmic R&B style, but the feeling of the song just honestly hit the nail on the head. It just really wasn't a very strong song, and felt like it was just a bit too much of the same from her music as was the case with the lackluster Diva. I really hope Beyonce's next record doesn't have a song like this one that felt like it was a crash and burn.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":5}

{"text":"The truth is, I don't own this particular CD, but several reviewers are mistaken about the facts of this material.  First, it has been available in very high quality form since Joe Pope released it on a series of 45s on his own Deccagone label in approximately 1974.  It then appeared on several LPs, two of which I own, in the 80s.  These were not \"bootlegs\" in the traditional sense.  They were excellent quality and were probably legal recordings at that time.  I don't know if there has ever been a legal release of this material on CD, but there are at least two (probably many  more) really good quality bootleg CDs that contain this material, in true studio quality, with no hiss or surface noise.\n\nFinally, there are 3 original Lennon\/McCartney songs: Loved of the Loved, Hello Little Girl and Like Dreamers Do.  While not lost classics by any means, they provide a valuable glimpse into their really early writing style.","classification":3,"fold":5}

Yes, she is unapologetically blunt (when it comes to sex, drugs and everything in between), yes, she dabbles with drugs in real life, and yes, her sound is authentic and DAMN good. I think I'm in love with that voice. I'll tell you why.....\n\nAmy's voice is at once sexy, sensuous, expressive and seductive, and her band is seamless (great horn and percussive section!). What's more, her lyrics are fantastic and unabashedly honest (at times lewd, yes, and allude to her addiction to blow AKA cocaine). She is probably best known for \"ReHab,\" \"You Know I'm No Good\" and \"Back to Black.\" I feel like I am back in 1960, listening to soul, and then the expletives come pouring out....but, smooth as silk. You can't blame the girl for being angry. I don't know if Amy has just had some tough luck with men, or whether they just take delight in treating her like trash. At any rate, this woman totally channels the rush of emotions that comes with broken relationships, as well as the rush of drug addiction. If you want to hear a good example of the broken-ness, I reccomend \"Me & Mr. Jones.\" (or most of the other tracks!)\n\nThis woman is amazing. I just hope (and I say this with sincerity), that she doesn't overdose before her remarkable career truly fluorishes worldwide. Note: As I said before, this album is explicit and has references to sex and drugs (quite graphic sex, at times). Still, this is one of the best soul albums I have heard.

After dropping out of college Bob moved to Denver and began working the local folk clubs. Shortly thereafter he made a demo tape. The folks at Liberty records were duly impressed and signed Lind to their World Pacific subsidiary. Among the tunes on that demo was \"Elusive Butterfly\" which became his first and only hit single peaking at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1966. Much was expected of the follow-up record \"Truly Julie's Blues\" but it proved to be a major disappointment.

{"text":"I'm a big Mark Knophler fan and routinely buy each album he makes. This is a two disk set with one being a bit more quiet, the other more rocky - bluesy. Mark has his various styles of songs that crop up on every album, and this album seems a little less structured thematically, compared to others. At first listen it seemed a little more subtle, more becoming apparent in repeated listening - I usually think that's an indication of  really good stuff.  Considering the album is called \"Privateering\" it may have been intended to be a bit looser and easy-going. I love it - I'm never disappointed - just amazed that such a musician can be so talented and prolific, yet running a bit out of the mainstream. He's still got the \"Dire Straits\" licks but has a much more varied repetoire. Still, I must admit to loving it when he rocks out. What a great unique style of playing!

{"text":"Jeffrey Osborne the ultimate lead singer of LTD sang this Ballad and it was the Song of our High School Prom 1967.  I did not have a boyfriend back in the days because I valued music more than most of the boys I knew and they were too shy to want to dance.  This song came on and one of my high school crushes came and asked me to dance.  It did not matter that he could not dance very well, I was just on top of the world that I was dancing to one of my favorite groups singing my favorite song at the time.  LTD was not the same for me once Jeffrey Osborne left the group but I still listen to his music.  It was and is still soothing, I play it when I am studying or when I am having trouble falling asleep or when I want to go back to sweet memories.\n\nJust take your time and listen to the meaning of the words and you will love it to.

{"text":"Lovely music!\n\nThis beautiful album was RECORDED on September 16 and 17 (not originally released as the data on the amazon claimed at the time I wrote this review)- Kenny Burrell, a true giant of mainstream and moderately modern jazz guitar really shines here in the illustrious company of Richard Davis on bass and Roy Haynes on drums.\n\nSome of the songs are really swinging, some are beautifully sad, some are pretty darn modern, but the general feeling of the album would be - in my interpretation - warm. The cozy tone of the leader's guitar really enriches his fanciful solo flights as well as the numbers where the rest of the trio has a larger role.\n\nInitially issued on LP in 1960, the album was re-released in 1966 under the title \"Man at Work\", with really beautiful photo by Don Brownstein reproduced inside the CD's package (the cover photo of Burrell, taken from the original edition, is by Chuck Stewart). Actually, my only problem with this lovely CD is that the original liner notes - printed twice, are too small even for a reasonably young fellow with a normal eye-sight... Keeping the cover art was smart, but the backside of LP is not visually interesting enough to compensate for too small letters.\n\nIf you like jazz-guitar or mainstream jazz, you should get this album, to hear fresh and convincing versions of various standards (f. i. Ellington-Strayhorn's \"Just a sittin' and a-rockin'\", Monk's \"Well, You Needn't\") as well as some less often performed songs.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"So, what is the sound and soul of this intriguingly titled album? Ill start our by saying that the sound quality is as exquisite as you could expect being produced by GRAMMY wining producer and Windham Hill Records founder Will Ackerman and engineer Tom Eaton along with pianist\/ composer Kori Linae Carothers. The highly modified Steinway piano at Wills Imaginary Road Studios is legendary and has provided the instrumental voice of numerous outstanding pianists over the years. The opening track, A Day Like No Other, touched me emotionally right from the start with its dreamy and slightly wistful melody. I appreciated the sense of dynamics in Koris playing  knowing when to lean into it and when to lay back, as well as finding the balance between notes and space. This blend of technique and feeling, for me, is one of the hallmarks of a great musician.\n\nI was curious as to what the title track would sound like given its enigmatic name. It turns out to be quite descriptive as the notes in the opening movement fall from her fingers like the first drops of rain in a summer shower. As the composition evolves, the flames are fanned about two thirds of the way through. However, again, the sense of dynamics I spoke of earlier is evident, and just as a fire needs oxygen to exist, there is breath within the blaze as she pulls back momentarily to provide some air and a release from the buildup. The maturity and level of expression in Koris playing are impressive.\n\nThe ability to communicate stories and emotions in her music is a gift that she is eager to share with the world. Kori Carothers is truly an inspiration, both as a recording artist\/ performer as well as in the example she has set in her life becoming a professional musician in spite of being deaf in one ear. She encourages others not let anything deter one from following their dreams and pursuing their passion in life. Fire In The Rainstorm is an eloquent artistic statement from a highly regarded pianist\/composer whose music resonates with heart and soul.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"During the mid to late 70's Robert Palmer was far from the household name he became during the mid 80's. At the same time at this point in the 70's one of the more fasionable things for a lot of white rock musicians was to record in the Crescent City with many of the local musicians from Dr. John,Allen Toussaint,Little Feat and The Meters. None of these projects were bad at all but strangly enough many of them were one or two off genre excersises that the said artist(s) never again returned to. This was not one of those efforts. Throughout even the 80's the core of Robert Palmers music was always soul and funk so it was only fitting he would make his first solo album in New Orleans with of course all the best people in town on board. Two of the most remarkable things about this are related to Palmer himself. He wrote or co-wrote almost all the music on this album and had a very keen understanding of how to create great funk music,from the honeyed nuances (as opposed to loud bellowing) of his vocal style. Now he does a great job for sure in interpreting Big Easy styled funk here from the rolling clavinets on Allen Toussaint's title track and \"From A Whisper To A Scream\" which Palmer also delivers with his great soulful understatement. There's more of an obvious Mardi Gras-style hump to the grooves of Lowell George's \"Sailin' Shoes\" and \"Blackmail\" but some of the most impressive songs on the album are the ones Palmer wrote himself. \"Hey Julia\" is an excellent song-a great rhythm box percussion led have jive\/funk sort of groove with a really deep Carribean rhythm under the service;not so obvious it's emmediately detectable but it's there if you recognize it. \"Get Close\" and \"How Much Fun\" both illustrate an understanding of the elegance of funk and elegance is a quality that Palmer himself always possessed very strong. Of course for a SERIOUS represenation of that there's the twelve minute closer \"Through It All There's You\" where Palmer really works a hardcore jam to death with his wonderfully jazzily phrased licks and how the song builds up and down from a full band sound back to it's lower key tones from the beginning. It was only fitting that his 70's sound was built very strongly on the type of music presented on this album and it's a credit to his integrity that maintained a strong connection to this particular element of his sound throughout his career as opposed to totally disgarding them when they were no longer trendy in mass culture.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Wolfmother arrived on the scene about 10 years ago with a Zeppelin sounding classic called \"Woman\" and it was awesome and that song kind of carried the debut album to a lot of sales.  Cosmic Egg was another solid album and in 2014 an album called \"NEW CROWN\" was released and hardly anyone has heard of it because it was very limited in copies released.  New Crown had a very distorted guitar sound in every song but a very good album.  Now to VICTORIOUS.  WOW.... Andrew Stockdale is the driving force behind Wolfmother to the same extent that Jeff Lynne is to ELO.  Stockdale has written his best batch of music and lyrics on this hard rocking Masterpiece called Victorious.  It starts out rockin' with the track \"The Love That You Give\" and the song quality never let's up.  This could be the best hard rock album released this year that not many people know about.  The title track \"VICTORIOUS\" is awesome and should be a big hit but with the music played on the radio in the USA, who knows??? If you are a fan of Wolfmother then there's no doubt that you have to get this, but if you like straight forward hard rock with great guitar riffs and super vocals and a tight rhythm section, then you are in for a treat with this album.  This is a perfect 10.  This is the kind of music I think Led Zep would be playing if they were still a band today!!!!! THIS IS TRULY A VICTORIOUS PIECE OF MUSIC!!!!!!!!!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"England Dan & John Ford Coley \"were an American pop rock duo composed of Danny Wayland `England Dan' Seals and John Edward `John Ford' Coley. Native Texans, the duo released eleven albums and nine singles in their career and are best known for their 1976 single, `I'd Really Love to See You Tonight,' a number 2 pop hit and number 1 Adult Contemporary hit. After they disbanded, Seals began performing as Dan Seals and launched a country music career through the 1980s which produced 11 No. 1 hits.\" Another reviewer writes that England Dan & John Ford Coley's music was along the lines of \"light pop\" with \"a touch of folk;\" and I agree!\n\nThese five tracks are some of their very best music; I love the way they performed so well! England Dan & John Ford Coley could harmonize flawlessly and their melodies were easy on the ear and memorable as well. \"I'd Really Love to See You Tonight\" got lots of airplay when it was originally released and it still sounds great in our time! \"Nights Are Forever Without You\" is a little masterpiece that is timeless; it has great electric guitar work and the arrangement overall is very strong. They cover Todd Rundgren's \"Love Is the Answer\" so well that Todd would surely approve and \"It's Sad to Belong\" is very poignant. The track set ends with England Dan & John Ford Coley performing their awesome \"We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again;\" this is yet another evergreen classic that I could never tire of hearing!\n\nBig fans of England Dan & John Ford Coley will probably have most if not all of these songs already, so I think this music is best geared toward more casual fans and people just discovering their artistry. True, it's very sad that Dan Seals passed away all too young; but he does live on through his music. I highly recommend the beautiful songs of England Dan & John Ford Coley.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"\"Black and Blue\" is the rock-music equivalent of a quickie, an album on which the Rolling Stones were motivated not by love or excitement so much as a simple need to do it, to get it out of their system.  They're slightly funkier and noticeably more relaxed, like addicts finally finding release (more accurately like randy guys getting laid): one can hear it on \"Hot Stuff\" or \"Hand of Fate,\" even on the lackadaisical reggae \"Cherry Oh Baby.\"  The Billy Preston-inspired \"Melody\" is memorable, because it's odd, but it's the album's emotional centerpieces, the designed centerpiece, \"Memory Motel,\" and the real thing, \"Fool to Cry,\" that stand out.  The music of \"Memory Motel\" shamelessly reaches for sentiment--shame on it--but Jagger's rawhide vocal and the honesty it adds to the lyrics save the song.  \"Fool to Cry\" is less appreciated than the album itself: it's straightforward, emotionally true, and sweet as the whisper of the song's little girl.

{"text":"\"Call Me Maybe\" is an incredible song by Carly Rae Jepsen, Tavish Crowe and Josh Ramsay. And wow, how this song gets the royal treatment when Carly sings it! She does this with lots of energy and just one listen proves it! The music fits in perfectly with those clever lyrics, too; Carly never skips a beat and this upbeat tune just couldn't have been done any better.\n\nCarly sings about a young woman who is instantly smitten with a guy, so much so that she gives him her number and hopes that he'll call her for a date.

{"text":"There is sincerely no question that Whitney Houston was a one-of-a-kind diva that really hit the nail on the head whether it was the poise, the charity work she had done for AIDS and cancer, or her having a school named after her in New Jersey back in 1997. But when she passed away in 2012, the entertainment industry lost one of its most beautiful treasures at the soul. When she passed on right before the Grammy Awards, it hit the world like a sledgehammer at the soul of the heart. I definitely know Whitney had never forgot how people treated her more like she personally was a mistake, and not a soulful and simplistic songstress. When Whitney passed on in 2012, right before Sparkle was released to the public, it felt like the world lost its voice. Arista chose to release a posthumous hits album to celebrate Whitney's legacy, and one of her last songs, I Look To You was recorded as a duet with R. Kelly. The newer version of I Look To You didn't even ignite with R. Kelly, whom wrote the song for Whitney over a decade earlier, but it didn't get to Whitney, until she decided to get back in the music industry, after she was mocked by the populace as the \"Crack Is Whack\" girl. When the song originally came out in 2009 from Whitney alone for her final album, it was beautiful and sincere at the soul, because the world was mourning the death of Michael Jackson, and it was truly beautiful beyond words. But posthumously with R. Kelly, it sincerely was no where near the \"Unforgettable\" intimacy in posthumous duets. It isn't a bad download for new Whitney fans and die hard fans of \"The Voice.\" But new fans and others, should just listen to her final album in 2009, I Look To You, and then judge for themselves.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"This brilliant showpiece CD brings together two separate LPs, the Pines and Fountains of Rome from 1978, the Ancient airs and Dances, along with the Albinoni and Boccherini form 1973. The Albinoni Adagio foretells the immense success of the Karajan Adagio series, which have earned DG millions of dollars. But these fillers are simply lush show-offs for the famous Berlin string sound.\n\nthe main attraction is Karajan's sumptuous yet refined way with the Pines and Fountains. Frankly, Respighi survives largely because of Toscanini's advocacy, and it would be hard to beat his electrifying accounts of both works, despsite outdated mono sound. The Berlin Phil. is incomparably more viruosic than the NBC Sym., and Karajan's sophisticated way with this second-rate, splashy music may not please everyone. He's out to civilize it, and for many that's exactly the wrong approach. Without its vulgar energy, Respighi's music has little else to offer. (Collectors of the Pines also complain that the nightingale recording used here is too drab. Okay.)\n\nFor me, owning one version of the Pines and Fountains is more than enough, and I nominate Reiner's famous version in Living Stereo on RCA, an all-out blockbuster. But Karajan's worldly approach is certainly worth a listen for its power and musicality.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"After recently watching a special on VH-1 about the life and career of Weird Al Yankovic, I remembered how much I love the guy. Hes been recording musical spoofs for over 35 years now, and no one in music history, I think, has had such a long string of spot-on musical parodies. His latest album, Mandatory Fun, proves that hes still got it. (Word Crimes is an instant classic.)  This compilation, though, covers his career from his self-titled first album through 2006s Straight Outta Lynwood, and as a whole its an excellent collection, with about 2  hours of music. All but the first of those twelve albums is well-represented, from Another One Rides the Bus (the only song from his debut) through White and Nerdy.  Of course, since Weird Al is so prolific and so often on the mark, some of your personal favorites may not be here.  One of mine is Mr. Popeil (from the album In 3-D), a hilarious send-up of both the B-52s and those special TV offers.  Im not a fan of the two long tracks included here, Albuquerque and Trapped in the Drive-Thru, which together comprise about 22 minutes of the two-CD set.  I would rather have substituted five or six shorter classics like My Bologna, I Love Rocky Road, Ricky (all from the first album), I Want a New Duck, Addicted to Spuds, Money for Nothing\/Beverly Hillbillies, Living in the Fridge, or Christmas at Ground Zero,  a Phil-Spectoresque style parody which I think is superior to The Night Santa Went Crazy. So to remedy that, in addition to downloading this collection, I cherry-picked another CDs worth of favorites that weren't included. Now Im bopping to over 3  hours of Weird Al and loving just about every minute of it.","classification":4,"fold":5}

What I love about this one is his rhythm section (especially Roy Haynes on drums) and the spontaneity of each track. Bassist Richard Davis is also spot on in the rhythm section.\n\nRun through the sound samples to get a sense of the flow and how telepathically connected the trio is. Haynes sometimes seems a little busy, but it somehow fits. Davis lays a solid foundation and Burrell just seems to float over the whole thing. I have an instructional video from Burrell that explains his approach to music and guitar and this album epitomizes the advice. Clearly he emphasizes the music using his guitar as a conduit for his deep knowledge of how music should fit together. Of course, he is a master of the instrument as well as a musical genius.\n\nThis album is possibly from the September 16, 1959 performance. There is an extended version that is called 'Complete Edition' that contains four additional tracks that I believe are from the September 17 performance causing confusion as to whether the original release covered both days. Frankly I do not think it matters, but I am always trying to be as accurate as possible regarding discographies and related information. If you know for certain please comment.\n\nOne final note: the album captures audience interaction, but not mid song. This adds to the ambiance without detracting from enjoying each note.

{"text":"I've been a fan of Bright Eyes since \"Wide Awake\" and \"Digital Ash\" and was really looking forward to this album, but after listening to it I find myself looking forward instead to the next Conor Oberst album.  What's the difference (other than the record label)?  Only time will tell, I suppose, but whereas \"Conor Oberst\" sounded like a guy playing with a band and with real instruments, \"The People's Key\" is a step backwards to the lo-fi sounds of a guy using Pro Tools in his home studio, layering and looping instruments and sound effects and sounding like he's singing in a well.  I liked it in \"Digital Ash\" but I guess now I want to hear more of Conor Oberst rather than Bright Eyes.  The lyrics also seem more obtuse, and combined with the sonics the record seems distant and opaque in contrast to the highly personal and warm \"Conor Oberst\".  So why did I give it four stars?  Because it is still a very good record by a talented musician who is always worth listening to, with inventive arrangements and lyrics and perhaps more hooks than any previous Bright Eyes record.  It's too good for three stars.  I can understand why some fans love this album and why some are disappointed.

My only complaint is that this collection omits the Top 20 hit \"I'm Coming Home.\" [It should have been included in place of \"How Could I Let You Get Away,\" which was the Spinners' debut single release on Atlantic, but was replaced by the b-side:  \"I'll Be Around.\"] While not as comprehensive as some other anthologies, this is a hit-packed collection of the Spinners' essential hits.

{"text":"March 4, 2009\n\nAs a young man finding my way in New York City there were what the residents called public baths. This was a very long time ago but as a music fan even then, I remember a young, explosive female entertainer named Bette Midler who would entertain at these baths accompanied by her pianist, Barry Manilow. Of course they would later break away from each other to become each outrageously loved and successful show business personalities. There were definitive differences with Barry Manilow becoming a much more  conservative recording artist whereas Bette is the nouveau Lucille Ball with a comedic lasciviousness that generations have enjoyed immensely. My wife and I waited in an endless, serpentine line to see Barry Manilow do a show at the Garden back in 1981. Once inside, we immediately noticed his engaging smile and friendly persona which is nothing short of contagious. His material, as evidenced by the classic Weekend in New England ranks amongst the finest songwriting in American music. In Barry's case, whether another classic of his I Write the Songs classifies him as a 100% singer songwriter is irrelevant. We appreciate him as a captivating singer who is an authentic charmer. That is exactly how Barry Manilow can credit his gargantuan success since the days of playing the piano and appearing with Bette Midler in New York's public baths. I would have to say that his vocals and keyboard playing are indeed highly professional. His strength is to light up any room he walks into and then you have have to add one of the most highly regarded song catalogs music fans have ever appreciated.\n\nJay Adler, Music Critic","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"The BLUE and RED ALBUMS make more sense to me now than they did in when they were first compiled in 1973.  At the time, it just seemed like a blatant marketing move, but that was when many of us were immersed in Beatles albums, and would not settle for a \"superficial greatest hits.\"  In reality they were always indispensable because they included so many great singles that were not on the regular albums.\n\nCDs changed the way we listen to music (you don't have to get up and change sides every 20 or 30 minutes, and you can program out cuts you don't want to hear), and while you can of course create your own collection, this is pretty close to perfection as a hit singles highlights gets for the late Beatles.  Perfect for driving!  These discs only contain about 60 minutes of music, and it could be 80, but by the 1990s the 1973 collections were classics themselves.  I can't give the set less than 5 stars considering the music that it DOES include!\n\nPersonally, one of my gripes was always that REVOLVER should have been in the BLUE ALBUM so that all the late psychedelic music would be together.  Some other ideas to make what is nearly perfect even better --\n\n1) Substitute George's \"It's All Too Much\" for \"Lucy In the Sky.\"  George's great song ended up stuck on YELLOW SUBMARINE, but it was part of the SGT. PEPPER'S sessions, and is a much better song than LSD.  2) Move \"A Day in the Life\" so that it follows \"With a Little Help From My Friends\".  3) In the animal department, substitute Paul's \"Blackbird\" from the WHITE ALBUM for \"Octopus's Garden.\"  4) Substitute John's \"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\" from the WHITE ALBUM for John's \"The Ballad of John & Yoko,\" a non-album single which I never liked.  The former is Lennon at his subversive best, and the song works just as well with Iraq as the backdrop as it did with Vietnam.  5) Substitute Paul's \"Two of Us\" from LET IT BE for George's \"Old Brown Shoe,\" a non-album single.  6) Substitute John's \"Rain,\" a non-album single (B-side to \"Paperback Writer\" from 1966, currently available only on PAST MASTERS, Vol. 2), for Paul's reggae-influenced \"Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da.\"\n\nThe late Beatles worked on multiple levels, and what was just immaculate pop to some represented emerging higher consciousness to others.

Highlights include the awesome electronic infused opening track \"Dead Inside\", the bombastic shuffle groove of \"Psycho\", the killer guitar riffs and effect filled chorus of \"Reapers\" which also has a mad guitar solo, the big half time groove and huge production of \"The Handler\", the massively Queen influenced call to revolt of \"Defector\", and the emotional vocal delivery of the cinematic ballad \"Aftermath\" which builds to a warm crescendo. Despite the fact that Muse have played it a little safe by adhering closely to the style they're known for, Drones is a good modern rock album that will satisfy fans of this band and certainly lead to another entertaining live concert from this stylish three piece.","classification":4,"fold":5}

The blend of the softly stated electric guitar played by John Gnossis and the unusual voice of Katie Bernstein transform this song from a good song to a great one.  Katie Bernstein's voice has a bit of a twang, but not in an even remotely country and western style.  Instead, her voice is filled with expression, as are the guitar lines, which are played in quite an expressive and emotive manner.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"From a US-centric view... I didn't recognize any track as being a tango one could really tango to (the rhythms are too variable), but track 2 came closest to my concept of a tango, a couple others seemed to be tango-based. None of them evoked the Pampas for me or felt like 'folklore' music (though the ballads were really quite good).  However, my experience with Argentinian music is severely lacking.  Perhaps these are tangos for those tired of the rest of the tangos, and 'modern' takes on timeless classics?\n\nThere are 3 sung ballads (5, 9, 10), and the rest are instrumental.  A few are guitar-based, a few piano-based, some with concertina and\/or violin.  Sounds most like easy classical jazz to me.  2 and 8 felt \"dance-able\" to me.  7 is a bit \"spanish guitar\"-ish plus flutes.\n\nThe musicianship and production are excellent, and the vocals are very fine.  I did enjoy most of the selections.  If you like gentle jazz as well as latin music, this is likely right up your alley.  However... if you're hoping to bite a rose and get your feet moving, you might be disappointed.","classification":4,"fold":5}

He has been referred to as Canada's greatest songwriter and internationally as a folk-rock legend...Gordon Lightfoot's music career has spanned more than 5 decades, producing more than 200 recordings. He helped define the folk-pop sound of the 1960s and 1970s, with his songs recorded by artists such as Bob Dylan, Gene Clark, Dan Fogelberg, Jimmy Buffett, and Jim Croce.\"\n\nThe five songs we get here truly are among the very best from Gordon Lightfoot; and this is excellent music that stands the test of time. \"Sundown\" is brilliantly done; Gordon does this so well and I really like \"Sundown.\" As another reviewer notes, \"Sundown\" really sticks in your mind after you've listened to it! There's also \"If You Could Read My Mind;\" I could never tire of hearing this ballad. Gordon sings this with true passion, heart and soul; it's a little masterpiece. \"Beautiful\" is very well done; and \"Carefree Highway\" is yet another classic Lightfoot tune. The track set ends with Gordon Lightfoot's \"Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.\" \"Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" just like the other songs here, got a lot of airplay when it was first released and it will never sound stale.\n\nGordon Lightfoot fans can download these songs to enjoy them again and again.

It will (mostly likely) pull you out of your trance, since It is literally \"bigger\" & bolder than other songs, but it's well worth it; it is such a SPECTARULAR Song!! - The one I first heard that led me to listen to the samples, read some customer reviews & to the purchase of THE WATERFALL in the first place!\n\nThe cover artwork (& inside) is also absolutely striking!  Whoever purchased the lp version can appreciate it even more!  The only other time I've heard music this pretty is from Mazzy Star (Hope Sandoval).

{"text":"In my opinion, Megadeth is by far one of the most consistent metal acts there is.  Ever.  Plain and simple.  Even with the myriad of players that have come and gone through Dave Mustaine's revolving band door.  With that said, and with the drudgery of 2013's Super Collider far out of sight in our rearview mirror, we are bestowed with Dystopia.  Megadeth's 15th studio album.  Gone are drummer Shawn Drover and guitarist Chris Broderick from the previous release and perhaps that's a good thing since I wasn't impressed with Super Collider very much.  Musically it was strong, but lyrically it was fecal and that made me hate it.  Enter Lamb Of God drummer Chris Adler and Angra guitarist Kiko Loureiro into the Megadeth fold and these additions seemed to breathe new life into the thrash metal lungs of one of the steadiest bands around.  Dystopia will be compared to any number of previous albums from Megadeth.  Some recall the long-lost days of Rust In Peace when Marty Friedman was shredding alongside Dave, others look to Coundown or the more-recent System Has Failed.  Subjective.  That's music.  In the ear of the beholder.  To me it just sounds like another chapter in the already vast catalog of rocking from Dave and Co.  Dystopia has licks and shred and gripping, growling Dave Mustaine commentary and that's why we came here, right.  Politics and paranoia.  Death and destruction.  Like I said, if nothing else, Megadeth is very consistent.  Sure. I will forgive the hiccup that was Super Collider (it was nowhere near the vicinity of St. Anger and it wasn't recorded with Lou Reed so Dave is still one up on his ex bandmates).  Let's take a look at the songs.\n\nThe Threat Is Real - The haunting middle-eastern opening is awesome!  Straight-ahead shredder album opener.  Lyrics are Dave Mustaine sarcasm laced with doom.  Licks all over the place.  Is this 1990?  The vultures have come home to nest.\n\nDystopia - Speedy intro.  Fall right into this song.  The cohesion is definitely back.  This sounds like something off The World Needs A Hero, which isn't a bad thing.  Shred fest all around.  If you only want to live and die in a cage...\n\nFatal Illusion - The riff for this song is something definitely different than the usual Megadeth shred.  Bendy vibrato.  Sleazy in texture.  Ellefson has taken bass lessons finally.  Starts melodic then shifts into full gear.  This was the 1st song to be released from the album.  Harmonized lick fest.  This is what we came to hear.  Great dark lumbering gore-splashed  lyrics.  Dave certainly took some time to get back to his usual clarity and bite.  Like whistling past the graveyard, when walking by at night, it's a fatal illusion to think that evil never dies...\n\nDeath From Within - This sounds like vintage Megadeth.  This sounds like it could have been on Rust.  Industrial almost.  Grinding.  Pulsing.  Lyrically concise and catchy. No one is safe...\n\nBullet To The Brain - The acoustic intro slides into a thrashing frenzy.  Is this Devil's Island?  Dave has a time machine stashed somewhere, because this is yet another solid song.  One after another.  Perhaps the infusion of new blood year after year is the secret to Megadeth's success?  Blistering solo.  Chanting chorus. Hooks galore.  Hot lead was penetrating deeper..\n\nPost American World - This far in and no fake newscast?  I'm shocked.  Here Dave gives us his State Of The Union Address.  It's dark, it's dreadful, it's filled with anger and hate and disillusion.  Epic!  Another catchy, rocking jam!  Six songs in and no stumble??? Wow!  Dave is calling the shots but these guys sound like they've been playing together for a decade and that's a rare thing.\n\nPoisonous Shadows - Eerie acoustic-lace intro.  Settles into a chrunchy cadence veined with licks.  Musically stunning.  Sounds a bit like Reckoning Day in the background, but this sounds like another layover from The World Needs A Hero.  Another Dave wants to kill his ex girlfriend song.  It's tight and dark and filled with venom.\n\nConquer Or Die - Some flamenco sounding acoustic guitar assaults us in the intro.  Wow!  Someone's been practicing.  Seriously.  When the shred kicks in its all over the place.  Stand-alone instrumental to show off the prowess of the band.  Creepy voices take us out.  Is that Spanish or Romanian?  Sounds like Vlad speaking from the grave.\n\nLying In State - When you delve 9 songs into any album, you usually discover the monsters.  Not here.  Still fresh.  Not filler as expected.  Another churning gem.  Is it as tight as the first few songs?  Yeah.  Dave speaks the lyrics and it reminds me of Megadeths Past.  Something like Dawn Patrol off Rust, perhaps.\n\nThe Emperor - Even the filler on this album isn't bad.  This song isn't EVER going to be your favorite Megadeth song.  Ever!  But it still rocks pretty hard.  If your lips are moving then I know that you're lying...\n\nForeign Policy - Sounds like something off Peace Sells.  Almost punk in its luster.  Thumping.  Stabbing lyrics.  Feels like getting jumped.  Good album ender.  Just something to show you that they can still thrash it out with the new kids.  Jamming!  Bludgeoning!\n\nOverall,  Megadeth gives us a very cohesive, grinding shred-fest of an album that will wash away all the remnants of Super Collider.  This album is a gem.  Dave shows new life and perhaps it the new players in the band that have helped him along.  One of the most promising metal albums of 2016.  Pick up Dystopia, you won't be disappointed.  Thrash is still alive and well and...\n\nDig it!","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"With a Mercury Prize nominated debut, Amy Winehouse changed direction completely for her sophomore effort \"Back To Black\". A more focused effort with a slicker, glossier production this album far eclipses her debut's tenacious innocence. The production gives this album the quality of commercial accessibility yet it still doesn't compromise the tough, angsty attitude that she is synonymous with.\n\nOnly Lauryn Hill has created a more soulful effort in recent years, and decades. A saviour for a country whose music scene is dominated by indie NME flavour of the month starlets, \"Back To Black\" is as refreshing as it is addictive. She is in the tabloids for all the wrong reasons: her chronic alcohol abuse, quasi-anorexic size and supposed self-harm. It seems that Amy Winehouse has become the new Janis Joplin of music. While these antics may paint a negative picture of her, they certainly don't detract from this, an excellent album.\n\nLead single \"Rehab\" gives the career boost Amy needs, but that song is by far the best on the album. Album standout is \"Tears Dry On Their Own\", sampling the classic Motown hit \"Ain't No Mountain\" it simply eclipses the original.\n\nThroughout the listener is confronted with incredibly honest lyrics, rarely do R&B, soul singers have the talent or ability to fathom such heartfelt lyrics, for this reason alone a folk injection can be sensed in this album.\n\nThe album veers between radio-friendly gems and bar jazz, yet all maintain the same high quality. The production courtesy of Mark Ronson is immaculate and slick. It maintains the perfect balance of contemplating slickness yet while not making it too saccharine.\n\nMany critics have compared this albums distinctive style to that of 50's and 60's gril groups, I find that rather silly as most girl groups of that time honed the same sound. \"Back To Back\" is far more distinctive to the point of being innovative and original.","classification":5,"fold":5}

I wasn't too familiar with Led Zeppelin yet, so I was later surprised at how poppy this song was compared to stuff like Whole Lotta Love. The middle samba section is fun, but the best part of the song is the awesome drum fill that comes out of it at 3:44. I get fixated on it sometimes and have to rewind and listen to it multiple times. Jimmy's guitar solo after the break is also one I like a lot. It's a bit sloppy, but so is standing in the rain.\n\nFool in the Rain is Robert Plant channeling his inner Elvis Presley and Bill Murray's Nick the Lounge Singer. He sings like he's suavely strolling on a Vegas stage with a glass in his hand...Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shinin' (thayouverymuch), like an ol star that can't wait for the night (you know what I'm talkin about), somebody get me a scotch and tonic, it's gonna be a long night, hrumph.\n\nAnd I stand in the rain on the corner (with no umbrella mind you) just watchin people go shuffling on down-town-uh. Look at those crazy ol people, they gonna turn it aroun, roun roun. (hey where's Charlie Hodge with my scarf, I'm sweatin like a pig here, ladies and gentlemen). I'm a fool in the rain, I'm just a fool in the rain. I'm all wet and I'm cold and don't you know that I'm a fool in the rain, (scats: 'see I was on the wrong corner all along and so all this worryin was really unnecessary'). Hit it, Ron.

But, when they become more like a robot than a real singer, than you know it is honestly time to throw them away. Unfortunately, with all of that that Rihanna has shown, she has been more like a wasted and manufactured product, than a real songstress, and sadly most of her songs have really been severely overplayed, to where she is more annoying than brilliant. Yet, I was not appealed with her recent set of songs from her life, because they, like her have been overdone. Four Five Seconds, didn't ignite with my heart, to what there could've been done with Paul McCartney and Kanye West. Her latest song, American Oxygen really continues that lagging path that she has been known for, by not listening to herself. She really sounds more like a robot, than really flexes her own voice. If Rihanna is going to have another record, she really has to listen to herself, than what American Oxygen has brought in for her, a wasted tank of gas.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":5}

{"text":"I have been a Melissa Etheridge fan for years and seen her in concert several times. It has been so amazing to watch her evolve and this album expresses where she is today. It kicks off with the rollicking fun \"I Won't Be Alone Tonight\", with it's positive refrain that the darkness will end and the tinkling xylophone that gets in your head as early as first listen. The second track is another toe-tapper \"Take my Number\", about being there for a friend and how things can change over the years. \"A Little Hard Hearted\" is a very modern-sounding tune (think Ellie Goulding or Sia). She slows the pace for \"Do It Again\" about that person you can't help but love, even if they are a little bad for you. People are always scared of what they don't understand on \"Monster\", which is super funky. \"Ain't That Bad\" kind of reminds me of 90s Nine Inch Nails, it is really rocking about getting over someone. \"All the Way Home\" starts out a little bluesy with the resonator intro but turns into a radio-friendly pop song. I could do without \"Like a Preacher\", filled with religious analogies about saving someone. I like the music, but not the lyrics. \"Stranger Road\" is more country than half the songs on country radio today, one of my favorites on the CD. The uplifting, fun \"A Little Bit of Me\" keeps the country vibe going. I did not see \"Who Are You Waiting For\" coming and it was a total gut-check. An amazing ballad to close out one of the best CDs of this year!","classification":5,"fold":5}

Mayer may be controversial at times in his life to the point of being a bit of an a-hole but there's no doubt that Mayer is one of the most gifted musicians on the music scene today.

{"text":"The Confessor was the title song from Joe Walsh's seventh solo album, released in 1985. It's also the most interesting single recording he has ever released as a solo artist. A two-part acoustic\/electric guitar showpiece, the song is a reflection on perceiving reality and the certainty of having to pay a price for treachery and evil.\n\nThe futuristic synthesizer intro is augmented\/contrasted by Joe's bluesy electric and haunting acoustic slide guitars. You can actually hear Joe's bottleneck scraping the brass-wound guitar strings as it eerily slides over them. Slow blues from the dark realm of another universe.\n\n Minor and major seventh chords complement Joe singing the murky philosophical lyrics of the first, and slower, half of the song.\n\nThe second half of the song features a ferocious electric guitar solo and one of Joe's most compelling vocal performances.\n\nThe Confessor:\n\nIf you look at your reflection in the bottom of a well\nWhat you see is only on the surface\nWhen you try to see the meaning hidden underneath\nThe measure of the depth can be deceiving\nThe bottom has a rocky reputation\n\nYou can feel it in the distance the deeper that you stare\nFrom up above it's hard to see but you know when you're there\nOn the bottom words are shallow\nOn the surface talk is cheap\nYou can only judge the distance by the company you keep\nIn the eyes of The Confessor\n\nIn the eyes of The Confessor\nThere's nowhere you can hide\nYou can't hide from the eyes (of The Confessor)\nDon't you even try\n\nIn the eyes of The Confessor\nYou can't tell a lie\nYou cannot tell a lie (to The Confessor)\nStrip you down to size\n\nNaked as the day that you were born\nNaked as the day that you were born\n\nTake all the trauma, drama, comments\nThe guilt and doubt and shame\nThe what if's and if only's\nThe shackles and the chains\nThe violence and aggression\nThe pettiness and scorn\nThe jealousy and hatred\nThe tempest and discord...\n\nAND GIVE IT UP!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"And I'm not talking about instrumentals either, I'm talking about lyrical themes to movies that have to embody the movie, and really set the tone for it the movie. However, there is a rarer quality of a movie song, one that if you have not seen said movie, but you here the song first, and you love the song so much that you actually want to see the movie. That is what this song does. While watching these past Oscars they played the nominees for best movie song of the year, and I thought to myself, it all seems so fake. The song from \"August Rush\" completely missed the mark it was trying to achieve, and \"Enchanted\" with the exception of \"So Close,\" sounded like typical Disney type fair.\n\nHowever, then came, \"Falling Slowly,\" a song from a widely unknown film, I was like, \"Wow, this is really different, this is beautiful!\" And it was all that and more, and the studio version only improved on these precious elements. It's a moving, gentle song that really touches your heart. And like I said, I liked the song so much, I now want to see the actual movie, \"Once.\"\n\nOverall, the surprise song of the year, and a feel-good story that these unknown musicians are finally getting the credit and recognition they deserve. Buy this song, and you won't be disappointed.\n\nBy the way, get this version, there's a longer version that was put out, and it's not as good, because the song seems a little bit too spontaneous and drawn out, and it also loses some of the elements that makes the soundtrack version so great.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"After twenty years on the scene, the artist wants to come out with something experimental. For most bands this is a signal that they're out of ideas and are about to collapse into radio nostalgia on way-back-weekends.\n\nNot Trent Reznor. The Ghosts are truly something very new on a long-known but previously underdeveloped foundation. Consider \"A Warm Place\" off Downward Spiral or the opening to \"Something I could never have\" off Pretty Hate Machine. These were reminders that beneath (and even coexisting with) the screams and mechanistic vicissitudes that define industrial music, Trent Reznor is a consummate musician.\n\n\"Ghosts\" is fully a harmonic successor to the atmospheric movements on the very underappreciated \"The Fragile\". Consider the 1999 album's \"La Mer\" or \"Pilgrimage\" as opposed to \"Where is Everybody?\" or \"The Wretched\". Not to say that NIN isn't atmospheric, but rather that there are definitely tracks with an intentional message as opposed to tracks that are more meant for the listener to get lost in. Ghosts is clearly the latter.\n\nThis is not an album you'll \"get\" in one sitting. It would fail miserably if it were so simplistic. Let it grow on you as you meditate through it.","classification":4,"fold":5}

I've played it quite a few times since then.  It's different from other songs by either artist but does them both proud IMHO.  If you watch The Voice on TV you'll notice that they are both judges on the show--possibly how they met and then chose to collaborate on this song.  Hopefully, it's the first of many future collaborations by The Voice judges (which also presently include Adam Levine from Maroon 5 and Usher but on alternate seasons include Christina Aguilera & Ceelo Greene).","classification":5,"fold":5}

Well, there's also my friend Jeff, Willie Nelson, Hank Hill, Freddie King, Buddy Holly, etc.\n\nCheap Sunglasses rocks, and it's hilariously ridiculous too. A humorous ode to eyewear. The first verse is about acquiring cheap sunglasses, the second verse is about stalking a woman who is wearing cheap sunglasses, and the third verse is also about acquiring cheap sunglasses. If there is a chorus, it's Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah.\n\nInstrumentally, there is the prominent use of a Planet N keyboard, heard in the halting breaks at 0:37, 1:05 and 3:21, at the end of each verse\/chorus. At 1:06 and 1:50, you get the keyboard and this funny woo-woo-woo alarm sound. Perhaps that's the police coming after the stalker, or a signal that if you currently are not wearing your sunglasses, now is the time to don them and keep your head down. There are some great guitar solos as well, starting at 1:26 and again at 2:10, displaying some excellent distortion and harmonics. Billy Gibbons rocks! Finally, at 3:23, they slow things down for a nice bluesy outro. In 1979, while disco was still prominent, ZZ Top were keeping rock n roll alive, baby.","classification":5,"fold":5}

I wasn't the biggest fan of The King Of Limbs. After an album like In Rainbows, it seemed like a step backwards. I quite liked a few tracks on it but I didn't care for the aggressive use of loops and the not so subtle use of electronics. I'm happy to see that with A Moon Shaped Pool there's a heavier focus on strings and piano, it's amazing. The songwriting and Thom Yorke's vocals take center stage. The instrumentation here is strong. The guitars are brought back much more than on the last album and the electronics are thankfully scaled back. It's a much more subtle and nuanced record. I can see this album being a grower and taking multiple listens to fully appreciate. A Moon Shaped Pool successfully brings together the enjoyable aspects of both In Rainbows and The King Of Limbs.

{"text":"Trans-Siberian Orchestra's latest release, \"Night Castle,\" has been highly anticipated by TSO fans for years now. Almost a decade since \"Beethoven's Last Night\" (their last non-Christmas release) and five years after their last new album (2004's \"The Lost Christmas Eve\"), the band has been playing tracks - usually their interpretation of \"Carmina Burana\" - from this album for the past several years during their winter tour shows.\n\nNow that the album's out, I personally found it to be nothing special. It reminded me a lot of the rather forgettable \"The Christmas Attic\" album that came out in 1998 - while not bad, you knew it could have been better. Constructed as a concept album a la \"Beethoven's Last Night\" or \"Christmas Eve and Other Stories,\" the story, while moving and powerful as read in the liner notes, does not come through well in the music.\n\nThe addition of four \"Bonus Tracks\" at the end of disc 2 also completely ruins the mood, and the track \"Nutrocker\" reeks of holiday music; ironically, this may be the best instrumental track on the album and serves as a glaring reminder that what you were expecting was not what you got. Even the tracks they had been previewing at their concerts sound stripped-down here; \"Carmina Burana\" is laden with mediocre choirs vocals backed up by a drum, a bass and a guitar, completely not doing justice to one of the most epic works ever penned.\n\nThe music also moves away from TSO's roots, relying more on lyrics, but this unfortunately comes at the expense of instrumental quality more times than not - I swore I heard MIDI in the background of some songs. The tracklist lacks the punch of a \"Christmas Eve Sarajevo\" or \"What is Eternal?\" kind of moment. There are some quality tracks, to be sure, but none that really that knock you off your feet.\n\nAt $3.99 for an MP3 download and $7.99 for the actual CD, it's not a bad buy at all, but it's not at the level of TSO's other works. After five years and awesome live performances, I was hoping for much better.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"Something Else Was Happening in Vienna\n\nHappy New Year from The Bach Guild  sorry we didn't post this sooner, but we were all off celebrating and listening to music and dancing into 2014 so heres our Big Waltz Box blog.\n\nAs some of you have already pointed out, theres more to the Big Waltz Box than just waltzes. But this box really named itself  its also not a Strauss box, and what in the world would a Big Vienna Box mean (Mozart, Haydn, Mahler, Beethoven, Strauss). But the thread that runs through this box is the waltz and a passionate group of musicians attempts to elaborate on the evolution of a grand Viennese tradition.\n\nVanguards co-founder, Seymour Solomon, loved Vienna, and his letters and diaries show that his summer-long trips to Europe for classical music recording sessions were centered around spending as much time in Vienna as possible. Postcards and personal letters show that he observed the Viennese like an anthropologist, slightly removed, always keenly noting behaviors and social customs.\n\nAlthough we go on and on about the role of Vienna as one of the cradles of the early music movement, there was still plenty of other music-making going on, and many hours of recording sessions for Seymour Solomon to fill. So it wasn't just the hunt for the new performance practice, and the latest thoughts on Haydns symphonies or Bachs cantatas. As The Bach Guild morphed into Vanguard, there was plenty of room to explore the rest of Viennas reviving music scene.\n\nAnd much of this box also answers the question of what the first chair musicians were doing while Vanguard and other labels were recording the Vienna State Opera Orchestra. For those not aware, the VSOO was essentially the Vienna Philharmonic, without the first chair musicians. And The Bach Guild\/Vanguard never made a recording with the Vienna Philharmonic (at that time the Vienna Phil was a Decca orchestra).\n\nBut The Bach Guild has hundreds of recordings with the Vienna State Opera Orchestra. This is where Seymour Solomons love of Viennese culture met another group of musicians determined to resurrect some music from the past that was misunderstood. Only this time it wasn't Bach, or Biber, it was the history of the waltz, from its origins with Mozart through Schubert to the entire Strauss family, and uncovering the music of composers like Lanner whose contributions prove essential to understanding the music DNA of the waltz.\n\nAnd those missing first chair Vienna Philharmonic musicians? Led by first chair violinist Willi Boskovsky, the rest of the first chair musicians were assembled and performed as Boskovsky Ensemble. That group recorded three of Vanguard\/Bach Guilds most memorable and beautifully crafted albums, and they are the heart of the Big Waltz Box.","classification":5,"fold":5}

It's simply hours and hours of beautiful!\n\nFOR THE MUSIC PURISTS:  Use this to fill holes in your collection - it's so cheap, it's almost like stealing.  There's so much here that you can't go wrong.\n\nFOR EVERYONE ELSE: Use this to build your collection.  There are at least 8 other MP3 downloads like this one which would start the basis for a lovely classical music library. If you get to the point where a piece doesn't sound right, or bothers you in any way, go out and explore alternatives.  There are tons out there.  What I like, you may not, and vice versa.  For example, the only people I like play Rachmaninoff are Rachmaninoff and Mischa Dikter.  Yet, I'm told a lot of people play him well - I just don't agree.  It's all personal taste.  Take recommendations, but figure out what you like yourself.\n\n At $1.99 each, that makes it under $18.00 to have 1800 tracks of 9 classical masters, ranging from Bach to Debussy. You can't even buy a family of 4 fastfood for that little.  Or you could buy 18 tracks on i-tunes, not 1800.  I can tell you, I did it, and it's been the soundtrack to the greater part of my life since I did so.  It especially makes wonderful background music while reading anything from fiction to nonfiction - and of course making dinner.  You can't beat this deal - just buy this!  Buy all of them!  Bach, Chopin, Debussy, Beethoven, Grieg, Mozart, Schubert, Schumann, Tchaikovsky, Composer Compilation","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"THIS IS AWESOME! It's the first thought that came to mind while I listened to this new OCMS release. I have to admit I was bracing for dissapointment after suffering through their last release 'Tennessee Pusher'. There was a few honorable mentions on that release, but overall it was a huge let down to me. I couldn't understand why they decided to reinvent the wheel after they had released their most sucessful album 'Big Iron World' to critical acclaim. However, 'Carry Me Back' finds Ketch and the crew back on track with a fervor that I have not really seen before. The writing and performances are excellent and show a lazer point focus. It's almost overblown - their way of saying sorry to the fans? Only time will tell.\n\nCarry Me Back isn't really meant to be theme driven, but yet I do find a reoccuring theme in the beginning of the album. It's seems to point at the degradation of classic southern culture and the old way of life. It also shows that a country boy can survive by any means necessary, especially if that's all he has left. The first five songs echo this idea. Then we shift gears and start burning it up. 'Mississippi Saturday Night' and 'Steppin' Out' are definite barn burners. It's a hyper active ho-down. Then they slow it down a bit with 'Genevieve' so our heads don't explode. This is an interesting song from newer memeber Gill Landry and it's good to hear a new voice in the band. I have a feeling we'll be hearing more from Gill now that Willie Watson has left the band - Willie's leaving is very unfortunate. Next is a Kevin Hayes song 'Country Gal'. I always look forward to Kevin's songs because he's got a unique way of spinning a tune. He always delivers a fun and memorable sing-a-long and this time around is no different. 'Country Gal' harkens back to Big Iron World and I love it. The rest of the album is good but it starts to gradually wind down and have no problem with that. All in all, this new release is a fun ride and it demonstrates a higher level of skill from the OCMS. It's good to see them grow in their abilities and yet hold on to the old timey sound of their earlier releases. I higly recommend this record.\n\nUnfortuantely this album brings forth yet more line-up changes for the band. Cris 'Critter' Fuqua left after they toured for Big Iron World (glad I got to see that tour) leaving a sizable hole to fill. Gill Landry was brought in to fill the position and he's done a really good job. However, filling Willie Watson's shoes is not going to be so easy. Critter was always more of a background guy where as Willie is a frontman with a big and unique voice. It's going to be tough to find someone of his caliber\/talent and have the diehard fans accept it. Also, Cory Younts, the extra hand that does a little bit of everything in the band has parted ways too. This maybe very noticible during live performances. We will have to wait and see if Ketch Secor has any aces up his sleeve. For the band's and fan's sake, I sure hope that he does.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"As I think many Whitney fans around the world probably feel, the title track from \"I Look to You\" and \"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\" both eerily reflected the experience and transitioning of the beloved megastar. Whereas \"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\" seem to autobiographically reveal what the last 15 years of her time on earth. Those 15 years were \"the dark years\" filled with wreckless events and perplexing choices that violently tore apart the delicate image of an innocent young ingenue.\nWhitney herself shared that R. Kelly had penned the title cut, \"I Look to You\" well over a decade before it was released. It proved to be a companion song to the previously discussed \"I Didn't Know My Strength\". After several multi-platinum albums, fans looking for a more personal project that revealed more of her solo and just who was Whitney.\nHer \"My Love is Your Love\" album was rhythmically exciting if not Whitney at her strongest vocal prowess. Songs like that title cut, \"I Look to You\" portrayed a Whitney stripped of her material wealth with only her love for one Bobby Brown and possibly Bobbi Kristina left. It didn't feel as authentic because of how impossible Wyclef's lyrics seemed at the time. But sure enough, before her sad transitioning, the yellow journalistic press began reporting stories of a Whitney begging friends and mentor, Clive Davis, for fiscal redemption. Even to the point that her 1997-98 celebrated $100 million contract, had become a debt that her two albums without Davis' guiding hands would sorely underperformed.\nNow RCA\/Sony her final label imprint wisely released a more critical mass greatest hits compilation with one new unreleased song, \"Never Give Up\" and \"I Look to You\" as a duet with its writer\/producer. It is unclear if that was the original intention or some technologically enhanced effort. The track is slowed and Whitney's vocals are noticeably different from the single\/album version. It is a must have collector's treasure, but, does not replace the power of that \"original\" mix. It is not bad, just not as personal. And that comes as a bit of a disappointment. Still, since this is her second greatest hits in the states (internationally Arista U.K. released \"The Whitney Houston Collection\" and \"We Love Whitney\"), maybe Davis wanted it to have the spirit of a Whitney that he and millions of other arduous fans prefer to remember. As opposed the more tragic aura of the previous studio release(s).","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"I wanted to review one of Cubes last 3 records, and I decided to do this one even tho its my least favorite of them... but I feel its still a good Cube album and a great album when viewed against almost every other rap album that came out in 2010.\n\nOf the 3, Raw Footage was definitely my favorite. It might even be in my top 5 Cube records. The lyrics were so on point, between it and Laugh Now Cry Later, it really seemed like hed found that spark he had when writing stories back between 90-93.\n\nThe music and beaten on I Am The West is probably my favorite since Lethal Injection because it was modern AND extremely unique, not just piggybacking off whatever sound is popular the minut he was writing the song... because if you write a song to be popular right then, chances are, in 6 months when its released, its gonna sound played out, let alone a year or two from now when you're looking for something to listen to... bottom line, musically, this is top 5 of his to me.\n\nBut now the problem... the reason this album only gets 3 stars is because this is the FIRST album hes put out in his (at the time) 24 year career containing ALL but one song (Hood Robbin) is essentially just emceeing the whole time... in other words, just bragging about himself and his skills\/rep. Gone are the stories and descriptions of life in that way that only he does.\n\nThe whole reason Cube has stood above the rest is because hes always balanced the emceeing with the storytelling (with a strong majority on each album leaning towards the latter) because Cube was supposed to be ABOVE that petty garbage and all the rappers that based their entire careers off doing just that.\n\nBOTTOM LINE, any Cube album is a great rap album because no one does it like him. The music is great, his lyrics are still great, its just the subject matter is weak, and unfortunately, subject matter makes up about 51% of the reason that an album great, and about 80% of the reason an album is worth listening to more than once.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"Dwight Yoakam is the reason I'm not embarrased to say I like country music.  When he broke onto the national scene with his debut album GUITARS, CADILLACS, ETC., ETC., he gave the country music establishment a much needed kick in the butt.  This twenty track collection hits most of the highlights of Yoakam's nearly two decades as a performer.  Starting with the Johnny Horton cover of \"Honky Tonk Man\" from his debut through two tracks from his 2003 release POPULATION: ME, Yoakam has had a major impact on country music.  If you're looking for a cheaper alternative to Rhino's 2002 box set REPRISE PLEASE BABY, this is a winner from beginning to end.  The only disappointment is that with a running time of just under 70 minutes, they could have added the only two top 10 singles missing from this set: \"Always Late With Your Kisses (from 1987's HILLBILLY DELUXE) and \"I Got You\" (from 1988's BUENAS NOCHES FROM A LONELY ROOM).

{"text":"I have to say like most Chicago fans that I am happy that hey have released a studio album with new material cause it was long overdue, but I have listened critically to this album numerous times and my first impression was right. Now this is not a comparison about old 70's chicago versus current chicago cause that is a matter of taste, but for the format that they were going for this album it did not work smoothly. If you are into the more ballad oriented Chicago, you might want to check this out, but I was dissapointed. There are some beautiful melodies sung with Jason Scheff and the writing material is not bad on this album, but I would have liked to see more imput writing wise from Bill Champlin and Robert Lamm since Scheff had the most input with seven songs.  There was too many ballads in the beginning of the cd.  I felt some more Chicago presence from track 7 and on, but not that much.  I did not like the producer on this album.  Chicago allowed over a dozen other musicians to play keyboards, drums, guitar, vocals etc that I felt cheated. I did not know who played on what track.  My biggest beef with this album is the way it was produced.  It had Pro Tools(digital recording tool)written all over and it was obvious.  I don't care that they are recording digital cause that is the norm, but it was way over the top!  The lead & back vocals(not to mention the brass)went through some kind of pitch correcting machine that is made the whole album plastic in the department of soul deliverance.  The back vocals on the song \"Caroline\" sounded like a straight keyboard sample.  Why do the these great singers Of Chicago have to go though that pop-machine?  They sounded like those country pop boy bands that have these pristine vocals and it's painfully obvious.  I do not mind effects on the voice but I still want to hear the human essence of a person's voice.  Not some voice pitch corrector that was invented for most millinium pop artists who could not sing to begin with.  These veterans have honed their craft so much that they should be proud to avoid such gadgets.  I do not mind the loops, midi, sequencing, samples etc, cause chicago was always in the forefront of using technology in the days of producer Foster, and not to mention Chicago 18 when the drummer programmed all of his playing into a drum machine, but this album is so overly produced that they would have to counter the next Chicago 31 with some organic sounds to balance for what they allowed.","classification":2,"fold":5}

Love & War, the lead single from her solo debut record is definitely a good starter. Her voice on the song flows nicely, it really is a better song than all the wasted songs that are on radio today from so-called divas like Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna, whom have made more trash than treasure.

I listened to Sara's song and thought what is this, Jazz?\nChris Cornell is rock and WAY off for me.\nThe majority of the album has a serious pop beat and does nothing for me.  I always thought of ZBB as one of the stead-fast modern times true country bands. I also miss a lot of the harmonies they have had in the previous albums\n1) Beautiful Drug- Pop\n2) Loving You Easy- more country with a pop beat\n3) Remedy- more true to the ZBB sound\n4) Homegrown- this is the first country single off the album and is more rock to me than country\n5) Mango Tree- feat Sara Bareilles- Jazzy- starts with heavy horns in the begining\n6) Heavy is the Head- feat. Chris Cornell- Rock.\n7) Bittersweet- slower paced more country feel\n8) Castaway- are we trying to be Jimmy Buffett and Kenny Chesney?\n9) Tomorrow Never Comes- does have a country feel to it.\n10) One Day- more Buffett\n11) Dress Blues- more of a country pace.  This is actually a lyrically great song.\n12) Young and Wild- synthetic rock beat.\n13) Junkyard- I am not sure what this is but I cannot stomach more than 15 seconds of it. and its over 7 minutes long.\n14) I'll be your man (Song for a Daughter)- I love the lyrics in this song, its beautiful.  Set more to an islandy beat but great ZBB harmonies\n15) Wildfire- more synthetic stuff.  Good beat though.\n16) Tomorrow Never Comes-Acoustic- and an acoustic version of song above.\nThis is just one music lovers opinion.

Absolutely buy the Deluxe version, the extra songs not on the American release are worth the extra money. And Take Me Home blows Adele's Hello out of the ballpark. The passionate lyrics and melody captured me immediately and ripped a hole open in my heart. I also recommend watching the official music video for Take Me Home, it is brilliant and very moving. Jess Glynne said it was done all in one take and I believe that added to the raw, true emotion she was able to convey.\n\nEvery song, for me, is a 5\/5. This woman can do absolutely no wrong in my book. When you listen to the album, let your mind strip away the music and listen to the lyrics. This album tells a complete story. Feeling alone in the world. Finding someone that gets you. Falling in love. Doing everything possible to keep that love even though the other person wants more than you can give. Having your heart broken as your relationship, one you thought was with your soulmate, crumbles until you have no choice but to break up. Not falling out of love. Feeling angry because you gave your all to something that didn't work. Being able to pick yourself back up and breath again. It truly is wonderful. Jess Glynne is a powerhouse vocalist, emotional lyricist, and soulful person that is beautiful inside and out. Anything Jess Glynne touches will end up in my music library. Once I'm committed to an artist, any artist, I stick with them though all their growths and slumps. Something tells me, there will be no slumps in Jess Glynne's future.

{"text":"Nada Surf is one of those groups that, much like Foo Fighters, Spoon and Weezer, hasn't drastically changed their sound over the years. When you pick up one of their records you know exactly what you're getting, which is perhaps the band's biggest draw. With every new LP you're guaranteed bright melodies, thoughtful lyrics, sweet harmonies and tight musicianship. The hardcore music snobs may frown upon that but at this point Nada Surf has gained my trust and when they release something new I'm always quick to jump on it as soon as possible. In that regard, You Know Who You Are is exactly what you think it is: another Nada Surf album, complete with all of the ingredients I mentioned earlier.\n\nRight out of the gate we're treated to \"Cold to See Clear\", which is not only one of the album's best tracks but also immediately identifiable as vintage Nada Surf. It's catchy and sweet in all the right places, as are tracks like \"New Bird\" and the closer \"Victory's Yours\". \"Out of the Dark\" manages to work in some brass the elevates the song to a new level with excellent results. The album's title track is one of the best and equally frustrating moments on the entire album, with a driving pace and layered vocals that instantly grab you. Just when you're getting into it the track suddenly ends, clocking in around 2:20. Another 30 to 45 seconds would have made all the difference but it's hard to argue with what's there.\n\nThe band manages to work ballads into the mix in equal measure, with \"Believe You're Mine\", \"Rushing\" and \"Friend Hospital\" standing out the most. \"Animal\" is decent but it's \"Gold Sounds\" that manages to be the only truly forgettable track here. It's not bad, per se, but it goes nowhere and never builds to anything during its nearly five minute duration. It's the only truly weak spot on the album.\n\nIn the end it's great to see these guys still around after 20 years. It may lack some of the energy that previous releases had but it makes up for it with effervescent melodies and a sense of peace and optimism that makes it hard to ignore. If you've enjoyed anything the band has previously done then you'll most likely dig this. Nada Surf has never set out to be U2 or Radiohead, constantly experimenting and changing genres with each release. They have their own comfortable niche and as long as they keep producing quality work then I can live with that.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"To begin, I must say that I loved the first Sixx A.M. album The Heroin Diaries which accompanied Nikki Sixx's book of the same name.  It didn't take more than a single listen of \"Life is Beautiful\" to become a fan of the band. At the time the concept of a soundtrack to a book was different and was a new concept to me, looking back I have to say it worked. Almost four years latter Sixx A.M.'s second album This Is Gonna Hurt is released, once again a book by the same name has been released shortly before. I really anticipated this second album as The Heroin Diaries was my favorite out of Nikki Sixx's side projects. The first Sixx A.M. album was fantastic; it was very honest, dark and twisted. I felt that it was reflective of Nikki's life and I could relate to that (and so did many other fans).\n\nThe title track kick starts the album with a bang, this is an anthem and fist-pumping track, it has a \"you and me against the world\" type of feeling to it. Unfortunately, the title track is a heavy and rocking as the album gets, everything that follows it is slower or softer, not heavier. When I first heard the single, \"Lies of the Beautiful People\" I admit that I was slightly disappointed but the song grew on me and gets better with each listen.  \"Are You With me\" is I feel, one of the strongest songs of the album, I love the chorus the song just works. When James sings the chorus with the \"come back from the dead\" part I get chills, it's such a great vocal performance and so passionate. \"Deadlihood\" was another song I really liked. \"Help Is On the Way\" has a great message and it rocks, nice build-up to the chorus. \"Skin\" is a lyrical highlight for the band, the lyrics are so personal, honest and touching which was probably the point. It's also very simple with James singing, a piano and orchestra in the background. It closes the album nicely.\n\nThis Is Gonna Hurt is overall a softer album and a bit less intense which is not necessarily a bad thing but I expected more rockers I suppose. This time around it feels somewhat less original; I don't have that special feeling, that connection with the lyrics from the first album. On its own This Is Gonna Hurt is a good album that has more of a modern feel to it. If you're a fan of the first I think this album is worth it as there are definitely some great songs worth listening to. I just wasn't blown away like I was with the first Sixx A.M. album, maybe if I never heard the debut I'd like this one much more. TIGH is a strong sophomore release from Sixx A.M., the band sounds tight. James Michaels proves himself once more as a vocalist and delivers a terrific performance. DJ Ashba is killer on guitar and Nikki is well...Nikki!\n\nThis Is Gonna Hurt is very much a continuation of TIHD, it's similar in many ways and it has a depth and beautiful lyrics but I feel that this time around while it works, it doesn't work as well as it did with the first album. It's a good follow up to the band's first album and it has its moments, I wouldn't say that it's as good but the ride is still enjoyable this time around.  I don't know, perhaps it was the point I was at in my life when the album was released or maybe I identified more with The Heroin Diaries for some reason. I realize that I've made a lot of comparisons to the first album but that's just me, on its own body of work this is a very good album with once again some excellent lyrics, great guitar work and some solid vocals, it works.  I wouldn't say This Is Gonna Hurt amazed me and I can't say it's a disappointment either because there is a lot of enjoyable music here, I just feel some reviewers are rating it a little higher than it perhaps deserves. It sounds a lot like what the bands of today are coming up with, maybe a little too much. For me I'd say this is a 3 stars out of 5, enough to keep fans coming back.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"In recent years the trilogy of records produced by a completely rejuvenated Emmylou Harris, which starts with the wonders of \"Wrecking Ball,\" climaxes with the brilliant \"Red Dirt Girl\", and gently lands with the lovely \"Stumble into grace\" amounted to a peak in Americana music. Harris could barely put a foot wrong and the awards flowed like wine. There have since been a couple of missteps on the way since this reviewer is not a huge fan of her collaboration with Mark Knoplfer yet particularly enjoyed the fine covers on \"All I intended to be\" (although not all the originals).\n\nMany have questioned whether Emmylou Harris is an artist who sings other people's songs better than she writes her own? In a recent interview with NPR she admitted that songwriting doesn't come easy for her: \"It's the fear of writing that's still there with me,\" Consequently with the majority of tracks on \"Hard Bargain\" self penned does Harris conquer her fear. The answer is yes in most cases but with a couple of songs that absolutely stand out. Her heartbreaking requiem for her dear departed friend the great folk singer Kate Anna McGarrigle is one example and possibly one of the finest tunes she has written. When \"she sings that you are sailing now\/ free from the pain\" it would take a very cold heart not to be deeply moved by its sentiment. Another even closer friend Gram Parsons is again the key subject of the opener \"The Road\". She has been here before of course not least in \"Boulder to Birmingham\" her poignant ode capturing the depth of her shock and pain at losing Parsons. While \"The Road\" is perhaps not in that class, her unique breathy vocals combined with a rock steady beat is a joy and the song's bridge takes it to new levels.\n\nOther noteworthy songs include the shuffling earthy blues of \"Six white Cadillac's\", the atmospheric country of \"Lonely girl\", the rocky \"New Orleans\" and the excellent cover of Ron Sexmith's \"Hard Bargain\". That said the straightforward country homage to a \"Big black dog\" has a novelty value but little else and while the waltz like \"Goodnight old world\" is fine it does drag. On the basis of concluding with a strong finish the final two tracks \"Nobody\" and \"Cross Yourself\" are excellent. They echo a Daniel Lanois style production except that album producer Jay Joyce writes \"Cross Yourself\" and his pop-related song is a splendid ending. One gripe is quite why her cover of the Low Anthem's alt country classic \"To Ohio\" sung together with the bands maestro Ben Knox Miller is confined to the deluxe album. This is a outright mystery since it is the best duet that Harris has done since her seminal vocal on Ryan Adams glorious \"My Sweet Carolina\" and you must promise to seek this out.\n\nThroughout the musicianship is \"best in class\" and \"Hard Bargain\" represents a fine collection of songs. In the last analysis its probably not as good as either \"Wrecking ball\" or \"Red Dirt Girl' but frankly there aren't many albums that could come within a hundred miles of their brilliance. Thus \"Hard Bargain\" is another fine contribution from Emmylou Harris a singer we should cherish and give thanks that unlike many of her contemporaries she remains a constant source of deeply moving music.","classification":4,"fold":5}

Ms. Blige puts so much of herself into her music, you feel her power and the feeling that yeah, I may be rich now, but i didn't forget where I came from, and im still a work in progress; I love that about her, she is no sale out.

{"text":"The 2001 album Ten New Songs is quite subdued and at first listen all the songs have the same slow gentle sound. But the old magic's still there on classics like In My Secret Life, Love Itself, The Land of Plenty and the elegant Alexandra Leaving.\n\nCohen covers familiar themes and one even recognizes lines from earlier songs, e.g. \"I do what I am told,\" (That Don't Make It Junk), while the mood of The Land Of Plenty reminds me of Heart With No Companion from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Various-Positions\/dp\/B0012GMW7A\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Various Positions<\/a>&nbsp;album, a devotional with a sentiment of complete resignation and acceptance.\n\nBy The Rivers Dark refers to Psalm 137 about remembering Zion and singing a song to the Lord by the rivers of Babylon.

{"text":"This album is the soundtrack to the movie Bjork made called \"Dancer in the Dark\". The movie was styled like a musical and was extremely emotional and sad.\n\nThe music on this album however is a joy! From the beginning which starts with an instrumental, \"Overture\", which is a wonderful combination of stringed instruments, wood winds, and a little brass. There really is not one bad song on this album (the rest all have vocals by the way). Only 2 positive points I'd like to make:\n\n- Bjork fuses her own unique style with strings and horns to create this broadway musical feel in the majority of the songs without ever losing the essence of Bjork's signature style.\n\n- The duet with Thom Yorke on \"I've Seen It All\" is legendary and amazing in that these 2 talented people got the chance to create a beautiful ballad.\n\nAny fan of Bjork will like this, it doesn't matter if you're into her earlier or later stuff.\n\nHighly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":5}

It is not only a great song to dance to but when you get on that skating rink you do moves you didn't think you had. I would recommend this song to anyone who loved those early 80's bands.

{"text":"Fergie's Best Isn't That Great, March 19, 2008\n\nLast summer had its share of good music as always, and we at least had a little variety on the radio. Enter, Fergie, the seemingly sex-crazed double-entree singer who sung about her humps, and London Bridge, and a myriad of other metaphors. But this time, instead of doing that stuff, it's a breakup song, with acoustic guitar, and only the hint of a beat.\n\nThe lyrics aren't too bad, pretty simple, with hints of 'where did that come from?' Such as, \"We'll play jacks and uno cards.\" The verses are overall OK, nothing to brag about, and the vocals lack in some parts. However, the chorus comes out strong, and it and the acoustic guitar really make this a good song.\n\nSo overall, a good song, not a great one. A great change for Fergie, and definitely her best song by far, Black Eyed Peas or not. But in terms of getting this song, I wouldn't buy it, but I'd get it by other means if you know what I mean.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"When I heard Yes was coming out with a new album I was excited and couldn't wait to get it. They are, in my opinion, one of the most influential rock bands of all time. But then I heard Jon Anderson, their vocalist for much of their career, would not be singing, and I was disappointed... Almost reluctant to listen. Though I was very skeptical at first, I'm so glad that I gave it shot. The band, consisting of Benoit David on vocals, along with Chris Squire (bass), Steve Howe (guitar), Alan White (drums) and Geoff Downes (keyboards) sounds amazing. The production is crisp and fresh, and, most importantly, the songs are awesome. \"Fly From Here\" gets things going and is a 5 part, more then 20 minute long song that includes \"Overture\" as well as \"Fly From Here\" parts I - V. This isn't really something Yes has done before: It has a darker, more atmospheric feel then typical Yes songs. The main chorus is phenomenal, and Steve Howe's playing will blow your mind! He shows his true nature as a virtuoso as he alternates between an astral slide guitar, a straight ahead attack, and the perfect blend of melody, Spanish-influenced guitars, and scorching solos. As is typical of his style, his playing enhances each and every song, adding dramatic textures and harmonies that only he is capable of. The result is a fresh sounding masterpiece that even long time, diehard fans of the band will love.  \"The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be\" is a Squire-penned ballad with more amazing guitars and bass. And while he'll never be Jon Anderson, Benoit David's vocals are spot on and he can really deliver! \"Life on a Film Set\" starts off slow and mellow but gains energy and intensity; I was sucked in and couldn't help playing it over and over to catch every nuance. \"Into the Storm\" closes out the CD with a bang. It has some cool analog synth guitars in which Howe shows off his wide repertoire of licks and features some of the best multi layered vocal harmonies I've heard in a long time. From start to finish this is an incredible album that leaves you wanting more. I would highly recommend it to anyone!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I purchased this album for my husband, as he has been walking around for the past few months singing snippets of Lydia.\nI admit, once I read the reviews, I had ulterior motives for purchasing this for my husband, because if I bought the cd for him, I would be able to put it on the computer and he could take the cd with him to work. :D\nSo I am 30, mom of 4, and I love all genres of music, but rock and classical are tied at my number 1 favorites. Classic country is a close second. (Don't judge me ;) )\nNow this cd is definitely explicit. I cannot really listen to most of the songs with the kids around (bummer, because the guitar is freakin' awesome.)\nI have found myself listening more and more to my own purchased music, as most rock bands out there just suck and all sound the same nowadays. Even Foo Fighters (I love them to death) are getting boring. I had begun to lose all faith and originality in \"Rock 'n' Roll.\"\n\nI just love the instrumentals on this cd. Highly Suspect is a very talented trio. I liked seeing that they write their own music. It's hard for me to respect a musician who doesn't write their own songs. I would say I would love to hear just an instrumental cd of these songs, but then I would miss out on Mr. Stevens' raspy, soulful voice.\nThe lyrics, as I said, are explicit, but it does warn you of that on the cover! I would have liked some more \"peppiness\" or \"cheerfulness\" is maybe a better word, in some of the lyrics. (The beats are plenty peppy.) A majority of the songs are just a little more angst-ridden than I prefer, but then again, I am past that part of my life, and my husband quite agrees.\n\nAll in all, I would buy this cd again in a heartbeat, just for the guitar and the voice of the singer. (But I really wish I could listen to this with the kids around!!) Nothing is repetitive, it all sounds fresh.\n\nI hate to compare them to any other band, because they are unique in their own way, if that makes sense. Yes, you could compare the singer's voice to that of the guy from Kings of Leon, or even the dude from The Black Keys, but his execution and stresses on different notes is better than both, in my opinion. And really, it would be a disservice to this great band to compare them to anyone else. I really feel the pain coming through in a lot of the songs, and feel that this guy is a real person who has gone through hard times, and is very passionate about getting his story out, whereas I just don't get that same feeling from a lot of other singers.","classification":4,"fold":5}

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band<\/a>. There was orchestral rock before this masterpiece, and most rock albums using strings and horns from 1967 or 1968 sound nothing like Sgt. Pepper.\n\nOdessa sure doesn't. Where Pepper was really, on one level, about applying any type of music to rock--making it a limitless expanse, Odessa is extremely consistent in sound.\n\nOdessa shoots for an almost Spectorian, Wagnerian sense of orchestral pop. Huge strings, huge echo on the voices. Listen and the Beegees seem to sing out of the funnel center of the bigness they crate.\n\nYou'd better get used to this  sound if planning to sit through Odessa, because it runs through what was a double album. (Young? Call mom and she'll explain.) If you like this sound, it is like being stuck in orchestral mud honey. Just surrender and drown in it for the next seventy minutes. There are deviations: some silly sixties light pop, and some country tinged experiments that really work.\n\nBut what there is not is a grinding guitar like on Pepper's \"Getting Better,\" rock and roll stomp like\"Good Morning.\" You would barley know guitars plugged into amplifiers listening to Odessa.\n\nI understand why Pepper is used as a bench mark, and in the sense that rock bands were more free to \"experiment,\" after Pepper, this is accurate. But if Odessa does not actually sound like the Fabs benchmark, that is ok. This massive red string thing sounds fine on it's own","classification":4,"fold":5}

This cover song was Ike and Tina's best selling single, winning them a Grammy Award. I have always been hard pressed to decide which version I like better. Both have their own charm. I think Tina put a bit more power, soul and meaning to it than John F. I like how Tina's version starts up slow and easy but builds up to a fast paced rhythmic crescendo. Well done.

{"text":"If you are looking for hip hop sound, scripture, tight lyrics, sound doctrine then this is the album to get. Great job with the lyrics and scripture was presented and then broken down into a song. This is a great album for those who are still trying to learn the word. This is the perfect witness album to give to people who are seeking to surround their life with the word. You can say this album is in a form of an audio bible as for as the story telling of scripture. Awesome Awesome work. However, there are two songs that I have to meditate on. False Teachers and The Millennium. He took a strong stance in these songs. I do agree against false teachers and calling them out if their ministry does not lead people to Christ, Enhance the walk of Christians, Provide Sound doctrine that is Bibically Correct,Allow Christians to discover who there talents and of course That Christ is the Only Way. If they don't provide this in there ministry then I believe they are false. But God's wod is God's word and those people that were called out are bibically based ministers. Everyone has there opinion and thought process and I believe we should all be alert. But at the same time those ministers have provided those things listed above no matter who they are. Meaning, we all are someone behind close doors which is what makes us Human and Sinners. We have to die daily right and examine ourselves and test spirits to stay in order. So do they. So I am so so about that song. Money...well they also write books, movies, albums, etc which gives them a certain income. I believe large ministries have to depend on Cheerful Givers to support the staff they have and means to promote, publish and broadcast. Christians should focus on the word of God being spoken rather than the money aspect. The Millennium song was pretty much on point and Revelations can't be taken literal and is very prophetic. But it is basic enough for Christians to know the victory that is at hand and Jesus is forever. I believe we should unite as the Church and be there for one another till victory day. This is must buy. Lets keep spreading the word using our talents to the ends of the earth!!!!!!","classification":5,"fold":5}
{"text":"I'm going to be very short and blunt -- in the first week of hearing this album I had some pretty nasty things to say (as many seem to) but upon further listens it has grown on me quite a bit. There is a most definitely Fleetwood Mac vibe to much of the album and that is NOT a bad thing and certainly is an understandable evolution of their sound. Many complain it is over-produced and to me that isn't the problem - the arrangements and production is excellent, yes, but I'm not of the opinion that it is by any means a bad thing. What does it for me is simply the lyrical content... while listening the past couple times all the way through the album, I was really really enjoying some of the songs I initially did not care for, but what kept it from working for me was the shallow songwriting, in many cases quite syrupy sweet, predictably rhymed, sentimental and melodramatic. It just becomes a bit boring and feels as if in some ways they have little to really say in these songs. Again, it's not a bad album - certainly not as bad as some make it out to be and there are elements to it I really love - but it isn't one I can imagine coming back to again and again over time. But then, of course, we'll see.","classification":3,"fold":5}

Beyonce' Knowles has became the most oversaturated product in the music industry and sadly the feeling of her songs has died, and not even worth listening to. Her remix of Flawless with Nicki MInaj is absolutely pathetic and awful. They have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. The song alone is awful for Beyonce', and just like what Jennifer Lopez did with Booty, remixing it with Iggy Azalea, she really made a song that was already poorly done, into a song that was even worse. It was actually done in regards to heartbreaks with her marriage with Jay-Z ending.

{"text":"The Watts, LA-raised, lyrical virtuoso Ras Kass, now over 18 years strong in the game, has banded with underground, boom-bap style producer Apollo Brown (Mello Music Group) for the Blasphemy LP. The Michigan-bred beat maker Brown has constructed a great set of productions that are just as complex and interesting as Ras Kass' lyrics are. As the title suggests, Blasphemy starts with Ras Kass making critical arguments against popular religions, especially Christianity, in \"How To Kill God.\" He will continue in this questioning fashion for other tracks, like \"Deliver Us From Evil,\" where he discusses various historical violations of The Golden Rule. Although proclaiming himself a fallen angel, he boasts wisdom all over Blasphemy by preaching clean living (\"Please Don't Let Me\"), racial equality (\"Strawberry\") and moral rules (\"48 Laws Pt. 1\"). As always though, Ras Kass still finds time to brag, strut and celebrate his gifts. His lyrical game is still sharp after all these years and so is his storytelling, as evidenced by \"Too Much Of A Good Thing\" and \"Francine,\" two songs about demons coming back to haunt mischievous women. Making the perfect beats to match the high caliber lyricism of Kass is no easy task. That's why Apollo Brown has combined eclectic samples, elegant instruments and East Coast style drum beats for a super nice audio event that can claim bits of orchestra, soul and r&b music within its mix.\n\nBlasphemy contains three power-packed posse cuts, but with all the mighty guest verses on the album, they never seem to outshine Kass and his enormous lyrical prominence. Apollo Brown and Ras Kass are both respectful of the hip hop culture and the rap game, even if Kass is picking on industry giants one moment (\"Humble Pi\") and saluting deceased legends the next (\"Bon Voyage\"). They make for a very compelling duo on the risky yet entertaining Blasphemy.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"Call this Drama II if you will, well, maybe not, but because it's another lead singer and doing another album I figured that's a good title. Well, the bashing has already begun as I knew it would from rabid Yes fans who just can't do without Jon Anderson on vocals. To be honest, not everything he has sung with Yes is five star either so to give this a bomb of a review based on that is totally unfair. How many bands have enlisted other lead singers over the years and based on that these groups wouldn't have been - Asia without John Wetton, Bad Company without Paul Rodgers, Foreigner without Lou Gramm, Genesis without Peter Gabriel, Journey without Steve Perry, Marillion without Fish, Spock's Beard without Neal Morse, Van Halen without David Lee Roth. You get my point, bands change over the years, band members come and they go. So, the morbid fascination with one particular member and not letting it go - boring. For this album, great release. You have to go into this open minded and not expect a Jon Anderson release, period. If you can past that and just listen to it on its own merits then it's a great listen. Benoit David does a great job and although he doesn't hit the high notes like Anderson (much like every lead singer after Steve Perry can't hit them either) he still delivers a great album. Everyone is going to pick this album apart and want to hear 'Tales' or 'Relayer' or 'Fragile'. Well, if that's what you're looking for don't bother with this release and pop those others into your player and keep listening to them over and over and over, again. Being familiar with Benoit David from his other group 'Mystery' I can say I enjoy this album. The opening track is great (although I wish they would have made it one track instead of several - but I Tunes lets you join the tracks so I can listen to it in its entirety in my mix) and I find nothing wrong with it and it's the centerpiece to the album. If you like this release check out Benoit David's other releases with 'Mystery' entitled 'Beneath the Veil of Winter's Face' and their latest 'One Among the Living'. With so much garbage out there today in the music industry how can anyone complain about this and there isn't any way it deserves a one star rating. I give it between 4 and 5 stars and do really wish they would have clocked it up to the 80 minute mark which shouldn't have been difficult to do, especially after having to wait 10 years for new music from this supergroup.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"It has been awhile since the guys from Matchbox Twenty have came out with a good song. It has been over 15 years since their debut stole the spotlight with Yourself Or Someone Like You. But even with Rob Thomas and his solo work, many have wondered if the group still has it after all this time. Their latest song, She's So Mean from their upcoming album North is definitely a good example. The song definitely isn't a bad song, while it still isn't as classic as Unwell or Push has been with the group, it definitely still is a better song than what has been coming out on radio lately. Hopefully, there will be more great music from Matchbox Twenty coming around soon. That wouldn't be too mean to ask.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":5}

Many reviewers reference a return to the sound of Sugar's Copper Blue.

She has definitely shown a sweetness in her voice that still ignites all of these years, after she went on her own. But nevertheless, many people do not know her well with cover songs. But No More \"I Love You's\" honestly remains one of my favorite cover songs of her career that is a sweet, haunting, somber but beautiful song that still ignites from the soul of her voice. She definitely made a cover work even better, and it is honestly one of my favorite tracks Annie had recorded back in the 90's, that really is worth listening too. If you have honestly loved her recent cover of I Put A Spell On You, than you absolutely will love this classic cover she did from her Medusa album. I sincerely recommend this classic song.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":5}

It includes his first single released in 1991 the calypso tinged May Christmas Bring You Happiness and traditional ballad At Christmas Time. May Christmas...was issued on CD with 2 remixes which is sought after by many fans. A Very Special Christmas 2 was released in 1992 and included The Christmas Song. Finally in 1995 he released This Is Christmas with 10 songs including the single Every Year, Every Christmas. Other highlights include My Favorite Things, The Mistletoe Jam and Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas. He combines originals like I Listen To The Bells (with Darlene Love) and classics like O Come All Ye Faithful. The new addition here is a live version of Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas (with Chaka Khan).\nThe lyrics are not included though it is a budget CD and complete!

{"text":"Contrary to just about everyone else saying \"Master of Puppets\" is Metallica's best album, I have always felt \"Ride the Lightning\" was Metallica's finest, and my all time favorite album.  The album starts off with \"Fight Fire With Fire\", a song starting with a classical acoustic guitar riff followed by an extreme pulse pounding rhythm section courtesy of James Hetfield, and lyrics about the aftermath of nuclear warfare.  The title track deals with whats on the cover, awaiting execution in the electric chair.  The track also showcases Lars Ulrich's double bass drums.  \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\", one of Metallica's most recognized songs, showcases every band member's talents, especially Cliff Burton's sonic bass assault.  Up next is \"Fade to Black\", a haunting seven minute opus dealing with suicide, and this as well has become one of Metallica's most popular songs.  The song has a special meaning to me personally, it was the first Metallica song I had ever heard, and it helped me through some bad times.  \"Trapped Under Ice\" is about, of all things, being frozen suffocating under ice.  The lyrics give a chilling (no pun intended) feel to it, and the song has a great chorus.  \"Escape\" is hte only song that could be classified as \"filler material\", but it is a solid track in itself.  Next up is \"Creeping Death\", which is a concert staple to this day, and contains biblical references as lyrics.  This is another song that showcases every bandmembers talents.  The final track, the instrumental \"Call of Ktulu\" is very well done and we get to hear Cliff's bass talents put to the test and we hear Kirk Hammett shine on guitar.  The only complaint I can even think of is that the album is too short and it leaves you wanting more, but that's not really much of a complaint.  All in all, \"Ride the Lightning\" is one of the finest albums ever crafted, and the second of the first five Metallica albums that are essential to every metal fan's collection.","classification":5,"fold":5}

But there are a good number of quality songs, and a few very good ones, including \"Spin\", \"Wash\", \"Am I Ever Gonna Find Out\", and \"Just Another Name\".\nThe only major problem I have with this album is track number 7, called \"Out of Breath\".  This song sounds identical to \"Hanging by a Moment\" in every way.  The music is almost karaoke.  I can't understand why Lifehouse would make a song sound identical to their only smash hit song.\nAll in all, a good effort from Lifehouse, but something was missing here.

{"text":"A Great Big World released \"Say Something\" in early 2013, with band member Ian Axel providing the only vocals in the song.  It had minor success until it reached the attention of Christina Aguilera, who decided she wanted to perform the song with the band.  So, the did a performance together at the American Music Awards and then released in September of this year.  While Christina does not take away from this version (she does a remarkable job at keeping her vocal histrionics under control), she does not add anything to song.  So, needless to say, there was no reason to make this version.  However, given that it only achieved minor success early on, having Christina's name attached is probably the only way it has a chance at significant mainstream success.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"This very British band is just an amazing mix of driving beats, vocals filled with whatever emotion is required of them, and lyrics that take on a number of subjects that usually require a more mature voice to be this good. I think it will take a few years before these guys hit their stride, but this debut has enough diversity and quality to leave you very satisfied. They might end up being too \"English\" for American tastes, but for me they really nailed it. Starting out with high energy numbers like \"I Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor\" and \"Fake Tales of San Francisco\" set you up for a completely up tempo CD and then comes the quiet thoughtful reading of \"Riot Van,\" where the tune totally belies the lyrics. Either the humor is spot on, in titles like \"Perhaps Vampires is a bit Strong...\" which is definitely not the sentiment in the song; or wicked social commentary is clearly expressed on songs like \"When The Sun Goes Down.\"  The band does a good job on both types. The only drawback is the music can occasionally get a bit repetitive with the same pounding guitars and drums for a few too many songs, but that's a minor complaint compared to what this band brings to the table; a fresh approach.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"One of the problems that arises in trying to review Taking Back Sunday's \"Faith\" is that the lyrics (\"You might lose your faith in science\/You might lose your faith in wealth\/You might lose your faith in Jesus, oh\/Or lose faith in yourself . . . Just please (please)\/Don't lose your faith in me\") so obviously invite comparison to Sting's vastly superior \"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You.\"  It wouldn't surprise me to learn that Taking Back Sunday actually meant \"Faith\" as an answer song, though if they did, they don't seem to have said anything about it that I could find.  Whatever their intent, \"Faith\" emerges onto the music scene in the shadow of one of the best solo recordings by a truly amazing songwriter.\n\nIn spite of, or more likely owing to, their derivative nature, the lyrics are the best part of this song.  The musical setting consists of some pretty intense guitar slamming that comes out louder and more prominent than the vocals for much of the song.  The vocals aren't anything special either; the singing often gives way to arguably tuneful shouting at times of greater intensity.\n\nIt's not a bad song, and it's worth a listen, especially if you like your music with a hard-rock edge.  I'll be keeping this one in my music collection, but \"Ten Summoner's Tales\" is going to get a lot more play.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"Been into this band since they released alive or just breathing. Always stayed  with them, buying their albums through Jesse leaving and Howard taking over then Jesse coming back with the last record. Just love their style of crushing metal riffs with death metal growls through the rhythm and infectious melodies and chorus in the middle creating something fresh and only Killswitch can do. Their sound has pretty much started a whole metal genre. But they always remain the best and sound fresh and new with each release. I never thought they ever phone it in on any album with Howard which Howard said he did with the 2nd self titled album. Still loved it anyways. But with Jesse coming back into the fold on disarm the descent. It's like a new energy has been tapped back into the band that I didn't think was missing but glad it's there. Disarm the descent was probably their best album since alive or just breathing in my opinion. So I had high hopes and expectations for Incarnate. And it delivers on every level even adding progressive elements into their music. Jesse is singing more on this album then screaming which I kinda like. I feel like his voice keeps getting better with every album. He's got sort of this punk rock vibe he brings with him to the table. On top of that he sings these amazing melodies. Adam D and co. Always bring these amazing metal riffs that are brutal and catchy at the same time. Sometimes they even get a little heavier on this album if you can believe it. Check it out if your a Killswitch fan or metal fan. It's metal ear candy.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"UK Indie band Alt-J's debut \"An Awesome Wave\" won the 2012 Mercury Music Prize with their inimitable style, a folky electronic rock blend. Their sophomore album \"This Is All Yours\" opens with \"Intro\", a theatrical instrumental garnished with choral flourishes. \"Arrival In Nara\" has a lovely piano intro that takes up almost half the song before transforming into a cinematic acoustic ballad, while the brilliant ballad \"Nara\" about a Japanese city with roaming deer has a magical timbre and builds to an incredible crescendo. The last part of the trilogy \"Leaving Nara\" is a beautiful Sigur Rs-style warble, with a trippy and delightful cover of Bill Withers' \"Lovely Day\" tacked on as a hidden track.\n\n\"Left Hand Free\" is a Bluesy rocker with vocalist Joe Newman slipping (as he often does) into what sounds like an extra terrestrial language at times, while the tender falsetto-sung \"Choice Kingdom\" has an other-worldly aura. The acoustic \"Hunger Of The Pine\" features a sample of Miley Cyrus repeating \"I'm a female rebel\", whimsical and absolutely enchanting. The Bon Iver-like \"Warm Foothills\" features Conor Oberst, Lianne La Havas and Sivu sharply alternating vocals and adding whistles to the folky ballad. \"Bloodflood Pt II\" is the sequel to \"Bloodflood\" from their debut, a mysterious ballad with haunting synths and guitar and gently clattering percussion, swelling and ebbing to dramatic effect, an absolute highlight!\n\nWith the bar raised this high, it will be interesting to see how Alt-J can follow this up.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Although he is best known for his extensive body of work in film and TV soundtracks, composer\/ pianist Peter Calandra steps into the spotlight in his other role as a recording artist of his own music with the release of his imaginative new CD, \"Inner Circle.\" The album sparkles, reflecting a rainbow spectrum of his musical influences ranging from classical to new age, jazz, Latin, and more. While Peter wrote, arranged, and recorded the music, and did all the digital sequencing and programming, as well as playing piano, keyboards, percussion he also enlisted some top-notch accompanists on bass, violin, viola, oboe, flute, piccolo, cello, and vocals.\n\nThe opening track knocked my socks off right from the start. The arrangement of this tune was impressive as it morphed in and out of different sounds and spaces. And speaking of different spaces, the next track, \"Dine's Waltz,\" is an elegant and cinematic composition that features some harmonic string writing that is influenced by Debussy. A classical element that I appreciate in this piece, as well as in Peter's music in general, is the way the music is presented in distinct movements - something he uses to great dramatic effect. . In addition to his dramatic orchestrated style, the album also includes a number of more understated solo piano pieces. Peter's arpeggiated piano motif is richly accented by sonorous strings on the album's title track, which again draws influence from Debussy, although a hint of jazz finds its way into the mix in certain sections. The album draws to a heavenly conclusion, with the appropriately titled \"Chorale.\" As the only track without piano, this one features strings and layered voices.\n\nWith the level of skill and creativity he reveals as a composer, arranger, and performer, it's easy to see why Peter Calandra has been so successful in his professional career. I was entranced from the album's opening track, and continued to be impressed as each new piece unfolded. It's rare to find an artist this adept at so many genres, and able to remarkably blend them together into a cohesive and continuously captivating listening experience.","classification":5,"fold":5}

You know where you sit down and listen to an album and you can't tell the difference from track 1 to 12 because they all sound the same? Yea that kind of played out.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"My great luck in finding large, outstanding compilations of classical music at bargain prices continued earlier this week when I acquired The Bach Guild's Big Haydn Box from Amazon.com for only 99 cents. This is the fourth of The Bach Guilds Big Box albums that I have added to my digital music collection, and I think I made another inspired choice.\n\nBig Haydn Box (not to be confused with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Haydn-Symphonies-Box\/dp\/B013THM8PA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Haydn Symphonies Box<\/a>, which I have already reviewed), features over 14 hours of Franz Joseph Haydns wonderful music. It is an extraordinarily impressive array from a variety of sub-genres within Haydns oeuvre. Haydn is known to have composed over 500 works across a large spectrum of sub-genres during his lifetime. By my count, 40 of his vocal and instrumental works appear in their entirety in Big Haydn Box. They include divertimenti, symphonies, string quartets, piano sonatas, overtures, fantasies, concertos for a variety of solo instruments, masses, and an oratorio. Each clearly shows the depth and breadth of Haydns incredibly inventive musical genius.\n\nThese recordings from the mid-20th century feature various lesser-known but world-class orchestras, conductors, chamber ensembles, choirs, and solo instrumentalists and vocalists who hail mostly from eastern Europe. All of them demonstrate the highest degree of artistry and musicianship in each of their performances. They do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama that Haydn infused into his music. I have now listened to well over half of this album and I think the audio quality of these mostly older stereophonic recordings is clean, crisp, and well-balanced.\n\nOf the four Big Box albums I have acquired thus far, I rank Big Haydn Box right alongside&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Mozart-Box\/dp\/B00B5Q7M90\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Mozart Box<\/a>&nbsp;as one of the best in my digital music library. I listen to it frequently, and I am always both highly entertained and inspired by it. Most highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I am what you would call the biggest NON-fan of Taylor Swift.  Not a fan of her singing voice (or lack thereof), musical creativity (ditto), lyrics, personality, etc etc etc.  With that said, a friend of mine told me about this album and being a Ryan Adams fan, I gave it a try with an open-mind.  The only songs I knew going into the album were Shake It Off (one of the most annoying songs I had ever heard in my life besides Call Me Maybe and that Friday song) and the Bad Blood song (which was catchy but ruined by all things Taylor Swift).  So not sure if the lack of original song background helped\/hindered what I was hearing but I was immediately impressed by the Tom Petty\/Bruce Springsteen musical stylings to these songs along with Ryan's incredible voice.  Yes, there are some really bad lyrics in the songs that Ryan covers here (which did draw some out loud laughs) but the music and his vocals made these songs actually really good.  Just goes to show you that some talented people can make the blandest or non-musically creative songs (i.e. 90% of pop music today) into something special.  There is a Youtube version of Brian Fallon (of Gaslight Anthem) with his side project band The Horrible Crowes doing a cover of Katy Perry's \"Teenage Dream\" that is pure magic!  Anyway, my favorite songs are Welcome To New York, All You Had To Do Was Stay, Wildest Dreams, and This Love...not sure if these would be a Taylor Swift fan's favorite or not, but there you go.  Team Ryan all the way.","classification":5,"fold":5}

We can hear Mary's own happiness and strength all through this album. This album gives us straight up Mary letting the public share her world, and delivering a message that says, Love yourself. Believe in yourself and kick negativity to the curb. Throughout this album, we can hear Mary pushing herself in ways she never has: especially vocally. There are jazzy inflections, girl group coquettishness, nuanced phrasing: a full range of tones and textures. She also continues to mature in the studio: taking control of the total recording and creative process and doing so with confidence and chops. This album is going to go MULTI-PLATINUM.","classification":5,"fold":5}

As a matter Dylans vocal performance is near the best of his career.\n\nSlow Train Comming stands strong as compared to Saved in its diverse musical arrangements.

The only difference is that Marilyn Mansons version is a grittier\/darker remake.  Im guessing-from reading online meanings of the song-that the basic summary behind Marilyn Mansons version is the controversial notion of a person witnessing both people being abused and those that are the abusers themselves (which Im guessing can apply to either personal or professional\/career settings).  I myself am lucky to have a loving husband so fortunately this song is not life imitates art for me.

Suga Free's verse on \"LIFE JACKET\" along with a tight verse from DOM KENNEDY make that one of the best songs on the album. But tracks 9, 10, 11, & 13 are nothing special and a lil disappointing considering its a QUIK album. I was let down by \"QUIK'S GROOVE 9\" as well. It's by far!, his only subpar QUIK'S groove. I wonder if QUIK rushed this album. I still bought it and will continue to support QUIK but he needs to get 2ND II NONE back in his circle asap. That is when he's at his best when he has them and SUGA FREE around him. It's worth a purchase but not nearly on the mark QUIK has set throughout his career.\nUPDATE!

{"text":"THE SOPRANOS-VARIOUS ARTISTS: A dark, sizzling sampler that's all over the map musically, THE SOPRANOS is every bit as invigorating and innovative as the mega-hit HBO series itself. Several superstar icons who don't normally appear on compilations leave their mark here...FRANK SINATRA's soul searching IT WAS A VERY GOOD YEAR, BOB DYLAN's born again outing GOTTA SERVE SOMEBODY and BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN's stark narrative STATE TROOPER. Lesser known artists such as the Boss' E STREET crony LITTLE STEVEN VAN ZANDT (aka Silvio on the show), earthy Mississippi blooze man R. L. BURNSIDE and electronic Brits A3 (whose rhythmic earworm WOKE UP THIS MORNING served as the show's theme) also make solid contributions, interspersed with \"can't miss\" BO DIDDLEY, CREAM and VAN MORRISON chestnuts. Rapper WYCLEF JEAN turns in an undisputed highlight in an album crammed full of 'em, fusing his own BLOOD IS THICKER THAN WATER to SLY STONE's slink funk-fest FAMILY AFFAIR. An all too rare example of a soundtrack that can be thoroughly enjoyed even by those who have never tuned in, THE SOPRANOS is a platter you really can't refuse.\n\nRATING: FIVE SLUGS","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"\"Come With Me Now\" by the South African band Kongos was independently released back in 2012 on their Lunatic but was re-released in 2014 when they signed a major record deal.  First off, the song has an incredible sound that incorporates an accordion and a hammering guitar lick. There is a killer steel guitar solo in the middle that slides and slithers.  The song is slightly undone by the chanting, auto tuned vocals where the whole band sound like they are screaming underwater.  Slightly less annoying vocals would have elevated the song to five star status.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"Queens rapper Cormega seemed to have it all. Despite a co-sign from Nas, a recording contract from Def Jam and being an original member of supergroup The Firm, it looked like things were finally going his way. However, a series of fallouts plagued the rapper's career. First he fell out with manager Steve Stoute over being replaced at the last minute in The Firm. His disagreements with Stoute led to his falling out with Nas- as Stoute was also Nas' manager at the time. Lastly, Def Jam shelved what was supposed to be his debut album \"The Testament\"- and making matters worse, they blocked him from recording for nearly five years. After 2000 rolled around, he was let out of his contract with Def Jam and decided to go the independent route. What was supposed to be the end for him actually turned out to be the beginning. As fate would have it, going indie would be the best thing to happen to him- as he would release some of his best work on the underground circuit. After trading barbs with his former friend Nas, he established his own imprint Legal Hustle Records to release his 2001 formal debut \"The Realness\". He then followed it up with the sophomore set \"The True Meaning\" followed by the 2004 compilation album \"Legal Hustle\". The following year, he ended his feud with Nas and released the shelved album he recorded for Def Jam \"The Testament\".\n\nAfter releasing his next recording \"Born And Raised\" in 2009, Cormega decided to take a break- one that would last nearly five years. When he did emerge in 2014, he did so with a new album \"Mega Philosophy\". The entire album was produced by Large Professor- recalling a fairly recent period where artists chose one producer for an entire album (See: Rah Digga's \"Classic\" and most of Murs and Buckshot's albums with 9th Wonder). On \"Mega Philosophy\", Cormega is opinionated and uncompromising- as he speaks on various issues that are near and dear to him. He starts the album off with \"MARS\", in which he's alongside some of the most respected emcees (AZ, Redman and Styles P). On the first single \"Industry\", he pulls no punches in telling the ugly side of the music business. Newcomer Chantelle Nandi guests on \"More\" where Cormega desires to uplift and enlighten the Black community. After the issues surrounding The Firm, Cormega has put the past behind him by duetting with Nature on \"Reflection\". Raekwon appears on \"Honorable\", while former Bad Boy signee Black Rob guests on \"Home\". \"Mega Philosophy\" is a great album from Cormega. Despite the album being brief at 32 minutes, he proves that so much can be said in so little time. It's safe to say this album could very well be the best of the year.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Already have the DVD from PBS, now that the new CD has arrived from Amazon, here are my impressions.\n\nCompare and contrast - What this latest CD 'Songs From The Silver Screen' and DVD 'Music of the Movies' offer, and what they don't.\n\nAlthough these latest offerings from Jackie Evancho never falter, or drop below the bar of very well done, they are not the type of fare which should be expected to appeal to the teenage crowd. At least not those teens who aren't already into show-tunes or classical music.\n\nFirst, the CD 'Songs From The Silver Screen'-\nThis album has more in common with her holiday CD last year 'Heavenly Christmas' than 'Dream with Me'. Even with Jackie's beautiful voice, most of the tunes don't rise above what one would expect for an very good easy listening CD. Two show-tunes she does manage to raise considerably above what one might expect are the opening an closing songs, 'Pure Imagination' and 'When I Fall in Love'. 'Music of the Night' and 'Se' do however have the emotional impact  for which Jackie is famous. While 'Come What May' is an valiant attempt, technically perfect, it does not quite capture the emotional energy of the live performance.\n\nNext, the DVD 'Music of the Movies'-\nAs is to be expected from Jackie's live performances, this exceeds the studio CD all around in energy and emotion. All of the show-tunes are raised above their station, and her best songs impact the heart full force. In addition to, and above what the CD performance offers, 'The Summer Knows' and 'Some Enchanted Evening' are raised to the level of fine art. Already powerful in the CD version 'Music of the Night' and 'Se' , joined by 'Come What May', become an emotional 'tour de force'.\n\nBoth are recommended for Jackie fans, CC aficionados, and anyone into the golden age of show-tunes. But if you must choose, the DVD version is the one.","classification":4,"fold":5}

Her latest set of songs just haven't set the benchmark as a real songstress. Bitch Better Have My Money or BBHMM, her latest song is absolutely pathetic and poorly done. She tries and changes her game and be more street, and instead her spirit in voice has diminished at the heart of the matter. Just like some of her recent songs like Four Five Seconds with Kanye West and Paul McCartney, she absolutely doesn't ignite at all. I think when Rihanna's next album, she had better for her career.

{"text":"One of my favorite independent artists has a new CD out. Ryan Farish was in high demand when the old MP3.com website was alive, receiving more downloads than any other independent artist. The Norfolk, Virginia area resident's music is a mix of New Age and Acid Jazz, blended together into a great source of listening pleasure. If you've never heard of Ryan Farish, you might want to check out the Weather Channel during the local forecasts as they give his music plenty of airplay. His new CD, \"Beautiful\" is bursting at the seams with life. It contains several tracks from previous CD releases. \"Secret Garden\" and \"Letting Go\" are two songs that get a second listen as well as new recordings such as \"Sunshine in the Rain\" and \"Adoration\".

{"text":"As a longtime fan of Muse, Ive been disappointed by the bands recent output. Its not that the past couple albums are bad per se, but they haven't resonated as much with me as Absolution, Origin of Symmetry, or Showbiz. Ive come to terms with the fact that they will never release another Origin of Symmetry, which is fine by me. After all, we already have that album and don't really need another version.\n\nThis was one of my most anticipated albums of the year. Early reports about Drones indicated it was going to be back to basics. I really enjoyed the singles (other than the silly drill sergeant bit from Psycho). Listening to this album, its obviously a long way from Origin of Symmetry or Absolution, but those albums were far from basic.\n\nOn the surface, theres plenty about this album thats laughable. From the awful cover art to the ridiculous Drill Sergeant track to the autotune to the cheesey drone theme thats overplayed throughout the album. Its clearly a concept album, and Im not sure the concept is compelling enough in this presentation. The lyrics are far from subtle, and the message feels a bit like juvenile politics. But somehow, this album works.\n\nMusically, theres no doubt this is the best the band has done since Absolution (or at least since Black Holes). There are big riffs and bold sounds, and its obvious that Muse was pulling from some of that old magic when writing and recording these songs. Some fans might be a bit turned off by the seemingly excessive falsetto on the album, but it actually plays well with the music.\n\nI didn't really expect to love this album, but its grown on me rather quickly. Id put it just above Black Holes and Revelations. Its not a perfect album by any means, but its the best Muse has done in quite some time. I suspect that fans will be torn on this record. If youve been disappointed by the last couple, theres at least a decent chance youll like this one. If you love everything Muse has done, you'll definitely love this album. But if all you want is another Origin of Symmetry, then why not just listen to the copy you already have and be content?","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Katy Perry had her taste of fluffy pop success with \"Teenage Dream,\" which was an insubstantial album, but loaded with inescapable pop hooks. It was a flirty, teasing album filled with songs of coming into your own (\"Firework,\" the title track) and goofy songs about being teenaged and irresponsible (\"Last Friday Night\"). There was also obvious filler (\"E.T.\"). but enough good material to compensate. Not so \"Prism.\" Every song is synth laden and seems to ditch the goofy fun of \"Teenage Dream\" for songs about empowerment and being more grown-up about life.\n\nSomeone should have warned her. The girl who danced around with fruit bowls on her head is not the lady making \"Prism.\" Only \"Roar,\" \"Walking On Air\" and the lovely \"By The Grace Of God\" pull this CD out from the ranks of a total dud. Perry is still a gifted enough songwriter that even the filler is catchy, but unlike \"Teenage Dream,\" the filler is quickly forgettable. Perry is holding back here. Where is the personality? She sounds restrained, the kind of pop that plenty of other pop-tarts come up with on a regular basis, where \"Teenage Dream\" and her debut \"One of The Boys\" often came of as flirty and fiery, now she just sounds like she wants to be taken seriously. \"Unconditionally\" calls out for love that lasts forever, but not with any spark.\n\nThe obligatory guest shot comes from Juicy J, who doesn't have the spike of Snoop Dog on the summer anthem \"California Gurls.\" \"Dark Horse\" again suffers from a lack of a sense of fun. Perry just isn't a gifted enough singer to convey the kind of emotional depth that \"Prism\" demands of the songs. \"Roar\" made for high expectations, but \"Prism\" just doesn't measure up. It's an average album from a woman who suggested that she may have had more to offer than platitudes and easy cliches. It just sounds like she's not trying very hard.","classification":3,"fold":5}

It is basically infusing us with what we need in order to walk faithfully with God.  Thus, it is about *trust*, *patience*, and *endurance*, though the latter two words are not pronounced within the lyrics.  It is also about not making major, life decisions without God's input.\n\nLYRIC HIGHLIGHTS: \"In the silence, in the waiting...still, we can know you are good.\"<<--[this is what made me buy this song]...\"Promised Maker, promised Keeper, you finish what you begin.\"...\"From this darkness, you will lead us, and forever we will say, 'You're the Lord, our God.' \"\n\nABOUT THE BAND: The band is top-notch band, in my opinion.

The song \"Promise\" could be sung by Mariah Carey, and almost no one would notice that it was written by Tori. It's a safe-as-can-be pop ballad. I literally groaned in disgust as it played.\n\nSorry, Tori.

{"text":"There was certainly a lot to praise about Parlet's debut&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Pleasure-Principle\/dp\/B00D6ZCTX2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pleasure Principle<\/a>. On the other hand it certainly didn't gain as much recognition as a lot of recognition that the somewhat more popularly focused P-Funk girl group Brides Of Funkenstein would. This entire idea of intense competition among the many satellite groups coming out from under the P-funk banner took an enormous toll on George Clinton's entire concept. And by the time Parlet were about to unleash it's second album in 1979, this became more than obvious. In addition to that newcomers Shirly Hayden and Janice Evans were just breaking into this chaotically conceived group. On the other hand,with further help from Ron Dunbar and a rather larger group of musicians playing on this album Parlet did gain a new and vital musical focus on this album that more than had the potential to push their momentum forward.\n\n  \"Ridin' High\"is actually my favorite Parlet number. It has one of the strongest dance-funk beats around,right on time horns and bass lines and a great hook exploring the songs themes of \"disco highs and disco lows\". \"No Rump To Bump\" continues the concept with a heavier Parliament type funk groove again-working a classic school yard taunt into the intro and refrains. \"Don't Ever Stop (Lovin' Me,Needin' Me)\" blends the vulnerable side of the sexual revolution that stands as an interesting contrast to the \"free from the need to be free\" Clinton attitude through a well arranged dance\/funk ballad. \"Booty Snatchers\" makes it clear P-Funk's outlook on the disco scene-to a stomping 4\/4 beat the albums concept is illustrated through a perception of disco dancers as \"body's who need bootys\". \"You're Leaving\" gets into some deep bluesy flavored funk-again exploring need in context of a human journey. \"Huff-N-Puff\" is a rocked out funk epic-using the Three Little Pigs concept of the liberated women dealing with hirsute male figures.\n\n  In a lot of ways this album betters Parlet's debut. Not only is the vocal mix quite a lot tougher, but the music-even the disco friendly aspects, are much higher on the funky groove quotient compared to the sleeker jazz influences of the previous album. Mojo magazine once proclaimed this to be Parlet at their best. And since they only recorded three albums in as many years, that is saying a lot. At that time anything from the P-Funk satellite groups were only to be found on vinyl and extremely difficult to locate. Luckily Real Gone Music has made this renowned and Iconic P-Funk album available for those in the digital age. And its worth hearing especially now. This album caught P-Funk and the funk era in general in an interesting transition as the 70's were about to spill over into the 80's. This was a time when many felt they would have no choice but to pimp the pleasure principle to gain creative and commercial recognition. And even at this point,both musically and lyrically,this album seemingly seeks out to try resolving these temporal conflicts within its own context.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"*Deep sigh* This is exactly what I knew would happen. Once I heard Yelawolf's album last year I told everyone the Slaughterhouse album would be just as messed up as \"Radioactive\" was, and I was right. This is not the same Slaughterhouse we heard three years ago. I guess I can start with the petty things like the cover art. It looks like a stoned toddler went and had fun on Photoshop for the first time. That cover is awful. Ok, time for the music.\n\nWhen \"The Slaughter\" starts it gets you real hyped. By the time it ends you expect the next song to come and hit hard, but it doesn't. It's some wannabe introspective track, and Royce couldn't even get through the first verse on the album without mentioning Eminem. It disgusts me. I had the same issue with their mixtape \"On The House.\" They can't stop themselves from bringing this dude's name up as much as possible. The man is washed up, stop acting like he's still on top.\n\nThroughout the album it's one song after the next and they all feel lifeless. Each one feels longer than the one before it, and it's just boring. It's obvious they tried to take the commercial route with songs like \"Throw That,\" \"My Life,\" \"Throw It Away\" & \"Park It Sideways.\" Those are hands down the worst songs on the album. There are some songs like \"Rescue Me\" that could have been dope, but it wasn't necessary to have all four of them spit a verse. That song would've been fantastic with just Crooked I and Joe Budden because they both spit amazing verses.\n\nOverall Joell Ortiz surprised me the most. Lately it's felt like his heart wasn't fully in it, but a good chunk of his verses on here aren't bad. Royce had to be the most annoying. And I hate to say something like that because I love Royce, but he just sounds so full of himself now. Crooked I did what Crooked I does best and was definitely the most consistent with his verses. Joe Budden's presence felt almost nonexistent and the verses he did drop were very bland.\n\nThe guest artists weren't anything special either. On the main album Eminem appears on two songs and appears on one of the bonus cuts. Skylar Grey appears on two songs and Busta Rhymes, Swizz Beatz, and Cee Lo Green each make an appearance. Luckily most of the guests only provided hook support except Em on track two and B.o. B on one of the bonus songs.\n\nAs far as the bonus tracks go they really don't lend anything to the main album. All they really do is drag the album on longer. They could have stopped the album after \"Goodbye\" and it probably would've been fine. \"Asylum\" has a really dope concept and the verses are pretty dope, but they all did a whisper flow which brought it down. For the most part the production is nice, but there were some beats that were really annoying.\n\nStandout Songs: \"Hammer Dance,\" \"Flip A Bird\" & \"Goodbye\"\n\nOverall Score: 4\/10 - This is disappointing. Even though I was expecting this to happen, I didn't want to believe it. I used to run around screaming \"SLLLLAAAAAUUUGHTERHOUSSSEEE!\" but I guess that's over now. Hopefully they get their act together on the next album. Stop trying to appeal to the masses and make a real follow up album.","classification":2,"fold":5}

{"text":"Debut release from Ohio based duo led by Dan Auerbach (The Black Keys) and Leon Michels (Lee Fields & the Expressions, Lana Del Rey):  The album takes a mellow approach that often hearkens back to the loose, fun soulful\/bluesy pop feel of the Keys 2011 album, El Camino.  Auerbachs songwriting skills are consistently sharp & on full display here.  Even as he moves through smooth & funky pop (think a more rootsy Prince), laid back reggae beats and breezy psychedelic blues, every song has an undeniably catchy appeal.  The overall feel is one of easygoing soul\/pop with a swampy melodic core thats packed with irresistible rhythms and hooks.  Guest musicians have played in The Phenomenal Handclap Band, The Mighty Imperials, McBride & the Ride, more.  Yours, Dreamily is not an album that really calls out to be played, but the kind of thing that your re-discover on your shelf (or in your files) after a few months, give a listen to and smile with the recognition of how friendly & comfortable the songs are.  Its a dependable, pleasant experience that you won't regret.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Around 16 days ago,I admit that I felt an indescribable joy wash over me when my husband started spontaneously singing parts of the I Swear by All-4-One  to me when we were relaxing together. My husband singing this song out of the blue was special to me because he has actually been there for me through both the good and challenging times for me (since we met in August 2002 and our marriage on January 22, 2004), especially with a career change that was unexpectedly forced on me over five and a half months ago. However, much to my relief our marriage has only grown stronger and closer since then and I found it heartwarming that my husband decided to sing I Swear to me out of the blue to me first thing that morning (16 days ago). Additionally, I first heard I Swear by All-4-One during my teenage years via local radio and it had been a while since I last heard it. Anyhow, I Swear by All-4-One is a beautiful pop song about loving someone and being there for someone throughout both good fortune and tribulations in life (with the lyrics till death do us part). Obviously,Im glad that this song is available to listen to online (as well as the video of I Swear by All-4-One).","classification":5,"fold":5}

Sadly, Beyonce' Knowles has really been more of a product than a strong songstress, and sadly the quality of her has withered slowly to death where she has been more tiring than exciting, and sadly that has shown in her songs. 7\/11, the lead single from Beyonce' Knowles, Beyonce' (Platinum Edition,) is actually a wasted dance song that definitely has shown she has honestly lost all of her voice. The song definitely is a wasted dance song that shows that she has lost her spirit. The song is honestly one of her worst songs in years. The song is definitely worse than, and below the stamina of other dance songs that she had done before like Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It,) Get Me Bodied, and Crazy In Love. I think it is definitely time for Beyonce' Knowles to retire if she keeps making poor choices in her music, and throws her heart away.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":5}

{"text":"It has been a long time since Chrisette Michele made new music that really delivered with both a young and old audience. While the past decade has brought her some ups and downs, with her own work, she is still holding steadily in her crafts. She has had some excellent albums with I Am and her second album Epiphany. But the later albums haven't been able to ignite in sales with Better and Let Freedom Reign, which had some songs that weren't up to par like The Goodbye Game and the haunting Charade, which was a real departure from her past works. She did come back soulfully with Together last year, but she is still trying to get back into the R&B game. Unbreakable, is definitely a good stepping stone, and shows a more edgier sound from Chrisette that mostly works to her own craft in song.

{"text":"Like many others, I became acquainted with many of Bach's organ works through Kraft's six volume Vox Box series in the 1970s. Given that those 3 LP sets sold for about $10 each in my university's student stores, no one can complain about about the price of the present digitization. Even then, the performances didn't stand up well to the likes of Helmut Walcha (DG\/Archiv). Walcha's more limited survey on Schnitger and Silbermann organs was more incisively interpreted even when tempos were similarly on the slow side. Kraft comes across as a very good provincial organist who is always technically acceptable and who allows the polyphony of the music to be heard. He is helped in that regard by colorful and varied registrations of several historic instruments (Leufsta Bruks, Haarlam, Lubeck, etc.). He is also consistent in bringing out the character of the numerous chorale based compositions. It is in the \"free\" works that Kraft can become a bit stolid. If there is anythng in the set that strikes me as an out and out failure, it is Kraft's sleep inducing performance of the \"Dorian\" toccata. It comes across as a finger exercise. An organist friend characterizes that performance and the one of the great Toccata in F Major as \"cheesy,\" giving the power of the music short shrift.\n\nFor the price, it is a good introduction to the organ works, even though Walcha in the same era wins the prize. More recent traversals include the Ton Koopman originally on Telefunken (now WEA) and Hans Faguis on BIS but at a much higher price.\n\nThe recordings capture the sound of the instruments well (including the clatter of the antique tracker actions) without being the last word in fidelity. The MP3 files played through my Musical Fidelity DAC connected to my audio system sound quite well - certainly better than my 40 something year old VOX LPs that were full of ticks and pops even when new.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"I've been a fan of the \"Oi Boys\" since the early 90's and when I heard Furler was stepping out I knew the newsboy I had known and loved were essentially leaving with him. Then when I discovered that the band was not quitting and that Tait was taking the helm I was extremely skeptical but a little excited to see and hear what the \"new\" Newsboys would sound like. I was scared that the CD would essentially be Tait's third release (which I wouldn't have minded if it were actually titled Tait). One bit of news that kept me ever hopeful was that Peter Furler would be heavily involved in the writing and producing of the album to help keep their sound distinctly Newsboys.\n Now that the CD is out I am both pleased and disappointed (but mostly pleased). The biggest disappointment for me was not the bands sound, its good rock with definitely some Newsboys flavor, it is the total lack of Furler even behind the scenes. This absence is clearly felt and while this CD does indeed have a Newsboys \"flavor\" its definitely its own entity and feels more like a new Tait CD.\n This disappoint aside the CD itself is very good. The original songs are catchy and fun and MOST of the lyrics are solid (facebook\/twitter references notwithstanding). The two cover songs that close out the CD aren't bad but aren't very innovative. The \"Jesus Freak\" cover could have been so much better if Tait and the guys had actually made it their own. KJ-52 is no Toby but his rap is as solid anyone could have done. It will certainly be interesting to see what the future holds for this group but I know I will certainly grab their next release.","classification":4,"fold":5}

For anyone whom samples a Elton John song, they have to really deliver a classic sound to compliment what made Elton John a definitive legend from start to finish. For Aloe Blacc who had a hit with I Need A Dollar a few years ago, he still has yet to find a song to reach the universal appeal. But  he decided to give it a shot with The Man, the lead single from his sophomore record Lift Your Spirit. His sample from the classic Elton John standard Your Song isn't a bad sample. It is definitely a much better than all the wasted samples and jokes that singers like Rihanna and Beyonce' have tried, but haven't ignited at all. I like the song because it is a good song to listen too. It is starting to show that when something good comes around, you might say Aloe could be the man.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":5}

The works are placed in chronological order by their assigned K&ouml;chel (K) number, quartets first, followed by quintets. This allows listeners to hear the progression of Mozarts musical thinking and development over the years of composing in this genre.  Without question, each of these chamber works is a Mozartean masterpiece.\n\nThe Barchet Quartet was a German ensemble founded by violinist Reinhold Barchet. Other members of the ensemble were violinist Will Beh, violist Hermann Hirschfelder, and cellist Helmut Reimann. Violist Emil Kessinger joined the Barchets as a second viola for the string quintets. The musicianship of these players is generally excellent, although on occasion the violins sound a trifle over-bright, and display a bit more vibrato than my ears prefer. The audio quality is certainly crisp, clean, and precise, but the recordings thin string timbre and lack of fine detail make it obvious that these are older recordings that date from the 1950s and 1960s. However, this in no way detracts from my overall listening pleasure.\n\nWhen Mozart: The Complete String Quartets and Quintets first came out at Amazon.com in 2014, it apparently sold for 99 cents  an extraordinary bargain. Now, even at nearly ten times that price ($9.49) I think it remains an excellent classical music value. With its low price, very fine performances, and good audio quality, it is certainly recommendable for any digital music library.","classification":4,"fold":5}

I recall a friend introducing me to the band on MySpace back around 2005 or 2006. My GF around that time and her group of friends were also into their music. The band had a 5 track sampler free on their page, which would later be published in this debut album. I'm not even a rap fan, but I can certainly dig Swan Songs.

{"text":"Cher's newest offering is 2001's LIVING PROOF, this is the version that was released in the UK before the US got a copy. The UK version features \"You Take It All\", which in my opinion, is the best track of the album. Instead the US version has \"When You Walk Away\", which is not available on this UK version. Cher once again provides some songs with inspiration and strength, like \"Alive Again\", \"Song For The Lonely\", \"Love One Another\", which all have messages of love and acceptance and moving on. Another favorite track of mine is the dark techno sounding \"Love Is A Lonely Place Without You\". The only songs I couldn't get into are the latin influenced \"Body To Body, Heart To Heart\", and \"Rain, Rain\". The rest of the tracks are winners, however I feel there could have been a better choice for a single than \"When The Money's Gone\". I love her version of \"The Music's No Good Without You\", which was the first UK single, a nice dark trance type track. \"Real Love\" stands out, it has a nice Daft Punk-ish sound to it. Overall LIVING PROOF is living proof, that Cher still has the goods!","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"The first Blue Ridge Rangers album was in 1973.  That effort covered such greats as \"Jambalaya\", \"Today I started loving you again\" and \"Blue Ridge Mountain Blues.\"\n\nFans of the first project have waited mostly patiently for the past thirty-six years.  I don't think they're going to be disappointed.  The line-up for this redux includes such greats as Buddy Miller (Universal United House of Prayer) on the guitar.\n\nThe latest version includes twelve country gems, including \"Haunted House\" the tale of a poor soul who's just bought a home which includes a pre-existing tenant, \"Garden Party\" a remake of the song Ricky Nelson got his fame from, and \"Heaven's Just a Sin Away\" just to name a few.\n\nAs you'd expect, the production values are excellent and so's the musicianship. I can't say this is a collection for Fogerty fans, because there are a lot of CCR people who aren't going to make the shift from rock to country, but if you enjoy country music done well, I think this collection is going to be one you'll enjoy.\n\nRebecca Kyle, December 2009","classification":4,"fold":5}
{"text":"Amy Winehouse is gone. The news is sad for many reasons, but it does drive us back to our CD collection to reevaluate her gifts - and they were extraordinary. This 2 CD album is probably her best known and certainly the number of Grammy Awards would indicate that. Just the lead song 'Rehab' is worth the price of the recording.\n\nWinehouse created a sensation both in the musical world with what was indelibly her own style. Many of us felt at first like this was another Janis Joplin, not only in her committed delivery but also in her drug abusive life. It seems like every generation has a wounded sparrow - Edith Piaf, Billie Holiday, Janis Joplin. And like those who came before her she was as much a star off stage as she was on stage. Now at age 27 she is gone, but with songs such as Rehab, You Know I'm No Good, Just Friends, Back To Black, Love Is A Losing Game and Tears Dry On Their Own her memory will live on. She was a one of a kind for this generation and it is difficult to say goodbye. Grady Harp, July 11","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Really. I've been into them since \"So Jealous!\" came out, and I've bought everything they've done since then. I saw them in 2007 on The Con tour- I still have the ticket stub from that gig. I myself have something to say to quite a few people instantly dismissing this album for being \"pop\" or too much of a departure: they've stopped making \"If It Was You\" a LONG TIME AGO!!! Really, they've made every album sound different since then, and you can hear it in the songs.\n\nI expect you guys would have figured that out with \"The Con\", but come on, guys. Tegan & Sara have been transitioning into a more pop sound for a long time and even though there's a noticeable difference between this album and the rest, they're still Tegan And Sara. They're still the cute girls from Calgary with great voices and the ability to make us smile every time they show their faces. The point I'm trying to make is that difference is in the eye of the beholder- Artists have to change some time and if they keep going on with the same sound their whole careers, the formula is tiresome very quickly.\n\nI'm giving Heartthrob 4\/5 as opposed to 5 because I've only listened to it a few times and although imlike it, I'm still not \"used to it\". I mean, I know my opinion will change over time, and already it's growing on me, but it's an album that requires multiple listens to for the listener to really catch the charm. There really isn't a weak track at all- theynall sound like they could be future classics. I Couldnt Be Your Friend is the closest sounding to T&S of old, yet it still has their perky, upbeat pop sound. It's an enjoyable track that really stands out. Even the single \"Closer\" great too, and the closing tune \"Shock to Your System\" is one of the best closers they've had in a long time.\n\nSo overall, if you can look past that they'll never make The Con Part 2 or So Jealous! Part 2, this album should be as enjoyable to you as the others. Sure it isn't as good, but it's enjoyable enough on its own right and it will grow on you. Recommended, for sure.","classification":4,"fold":5}

Maybe it\nwill grow on me, but right now it seems like Clive Davis used the same\nformula he employed on Fantasia's debut a few years ago. There are a FEW\nnice songs, but I expected so much more. The BEST song on 'Jennifer Hudson' is titled 'Stand Up', which is only available on CDs sold @ Target. 'Spotlight' is nice, and I skip over the songs featuring T-Pain & Ludacris....CRAP!! The song with Fantasia....nice idea, but I heard it all before! 'And I'm Telling You...' is great, but WHY is it on this CD ??? 'Leaving Tonight' by Ne-Yo & Jennifer would've been a better choice (I remastered the CD and included it....HA!). All n all, 'Jennifer Hudson' sounds like producer driven crap that floods urban & pop radio for the most part, while there are tracks that aren't well suited to Hudson's voice. Personally, I think this CD was a bad attempt to reach every possible demographic. Bad move Jennifer...next time, insist on recording a CD with more 'focus'!! Too bad today's legitimate artists (like Ms. Hudson) aren't allowed to show integrity on CDs while obvious attempts at getting 'hits' takes center stage. Oh well, let's see how the upcoming Re-Release of 'Jennifer Hudson' fares....you KNOW Arista is gonna add some extra tracks next time for more loot!

{"text":"Jaheim- Still Ghetto\nG H E T T O! What a word. We all know where the word is derived but what does it mean today? Jaheim seems to know exactly how to relate\"ghetto\" to everyday life. His first CD was great and this one picks up right from there. Jaheim captures the feeling of soul music. He is what NEO SOUL is supposed to be. I think the music we label as Neo Soul really isn't that. It's a new, fresh approach, reminiscent of the Langston Hughes age in Black America. Jaheim is the 70's revisited, not just in sound but in feelin. His lead single \"Fabulous\" is a great song. Some might tire of the kids participation in the song, but the real strength is the message. It highlights the up's and downs of \"ghetto life\" and how this community accepts it, shakes it off and keeps going. In listening to this song you are aware that it's really not talkin about white America but about our own community. For some reason we've developed a split in the black community, where affluent blacks look down on the \"ghetto\" life. As Ja put's it \"We've got love for yall but yall don't love us\". Good song. It's not being taken as seriously as it should. Jaheim really is a classic balladeer though, making true love music. Music we grew up too. that's where this CD shines. Track 5, \"Put That Woman First\" is reminiscent of Rrah's \"A Woman's Threat\" and uses the same sample that Ludacris used on \"Growing Pains\" from his Word Of Mouf CD. Great song. MJB makes and appearance on \"Beauty and The Thug\". Great song  and this duet was destiny from the moment Ja came on the same. they both embody the soul of the \"ghetto\". My favorite song on this CD has to be track 7 \"Me and My B*tch\". Now before you say anything I know that title might be offensive to some but MANNNNNNNNNN! Dude pulls this off! He makes this work. It has a smooth OJAY's ring to it. Great song. My favorite songs on this CD are 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,13,14...This CD works because Jaheim reminds us the beauty in the ghetto, the love and the life. Too many of us have forgot that the ghetto is more than just gunshots and teen pregnancy.","classification":4,"fold":5}

It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.

{"text":"I bet no one in 1998 would predict that Cher would release a dance album that would not only instigate possibly the biggest musical comeback since Tina Turner, but provide her with the biggest hit of her career(and the #1 song of 1999).  Well it happened, and though it should have been ignited by her grossly underrated '96 gem IT'S A MAN'S WORLD, as they say, better late than never.  BELIEVE, on the whole, is a pleasant enough album, with some very strong tracks, but also padded with an abundance of filler.  The title track is her best record in ages, and 'All or Nothing'follows very closely in this vein.  'Strong Enough' and 'Love is the Groove' also enhance the festivities.  On the downside, 'Runaway' is utterly generic, as is 'Taxi Taxi' and 'Takin'Back My Heart'.  And the dance reprise of her previous hit 'We All Sleep Alone' was completely unnecessary, particularly since that wasn't one of her better singles.  Overall, I'm glad she got back some of her commercial glory, I just wish it had been with a stronger effort.","classification":3,"fold":5}

Can I blame Mark and Travis for wanting to find a guy that is willing to show up to their gigs and actually carry the band forward? No, I can't. However, that means this band is always going to get flak for not having Tom til the end of time and all their records are going to sound like +44 albums under the Blink-182 name. There is fun to be had on this album but it only comes in small doses. I wouldn't say this is a true representation of Blink-182's work as a music group.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"Do you remember when Metallica used to rock? I mean, they still rock(well, sort of), but do you remember when they used to ROCK? If you don't, I suggest you get Ride The Lightning ,not now, but right now! If you aren't convinced, check out this imaginary conversation between me and a potential customer:\nhiphopforlife(ME): Welcome to my review of Metallica's second album, Ride The Lightning. before I start, let me give you some background on the band......\nAverage Joe:Whoa, hold on. If your name is hiphopforlife, what are you doing reviewing a Metallica album?\nhiphopforlife: Be patient, homeboy. Yes I am black and the biggest lover of hip hop alive, but I am no joke as far as hard rock and metal go, since my taste ranges from Tool(LOVE EM!), Dream Theater(very underrated),Creed(very overrated),Limp Bizkit, Testament,Nirvana,Pantera,Slayer, Korn and Metallica;my first album was And Justice For All ten years ago\n(anotheralbum you should pick up). I am more than qualified to\nreview this album. Now on to buisness. Ride The Lightning is the second album from the artists formerly known as Metallica. While their first album, Kill 'Em All, was raw and off the wall as you can get, the guys calmed down(somewhat calmed down) and created one of the most brilliant and inventive rock albums ever; and the scary part is that the album after this one, Master Of Puppets(a legend in it's own time) is BETTER! It starts off with Fight Fire With Fire, arguably Metallica's fastest song. Ride The Lightning is up next, which brilliantly looks into the final thoughts of a man about to meet his end in an elecrtic chair. For Whom The Bell Tools relaxes on the speed, but cranks up the heaviness with a great foundation riff from the late great bass player Cliff Burton. Fade to Black is next, which is Metallica's attempt and sucess at a \"power ballad\"...\nAverage Joe:Hold on ,hiphop;this has a ballad? Don't tell me that Metallica's gone Barbra Striesand or worse,Bon Jovi on us?\nhiphopforlife:To quote one of my rap idols, Ice Cube, KILL THAT NOISE! They have not wimped out by any means(the wimping out will be in 7 years).This is the second best metal ballad of all time(Sanitarium on Master Of Puppets is of course, number one. It is excellently written and sung by James Hetfield(the greatest metal vocalist of all time; sorry Ozzy).Trapped Under Ice and Escape are next; and to be honest, these two songs are just okay, in my opinion,which is why most people rank Master Of Puppets higher than Ride The Lightning; they aren't horrible, just okay. But the pace definitely picks up with the next two songs; DO NOT SKIP THEM! Creeping Death expounds on James' Christian scientist upbringing with a story on how Moses frees the Isrealites; it has a great middle part which makes the whole song worthwhile. Now it all comes down to the final song; the Call OF Ktulu, a superbly constructed instrumental which showcases all four members of the band's talents, especially the aforementioned Cliff Burton, who wraps up his title of the greatest bass player of all time.  That's Ride The Lightning, one of the most influential records from metal's most influential band. I would advise you to pick this up YESTERDAY, if not sooner.\nAverage Joe: Thanks hiphop; you sold me. You are the greatest reviewer ever.\nAnd you, dear reader, will be sold as well on the past greatness of the band once known as Metallica. Get Ride The Lightning, as well as their whole 80's catalog(and the Black album ,if you must).","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"The early reviews of this album are a bit harsh IMO.  First off, its true that the lead vocals are not that strong but they are not exactly garbage either.  I mean, the leader singer definitely has his shortcomings and I cant imagine him producing a strong live performance but at least on the album its ok. If you expected a Bruce Dicksinson like singer here then you will be disappointed.  They just don't have Bruce Dickinson like singers growing on trees.  Steve should have done Blaze Bayley a proper here and let him sing lead on this project.\n\nPersonally I'm just going to assume that maybe Steve Harris just wanted to make a 70s\/80s style hard rock album and get away from making a Maiden like project.  Some good rock tunes on this album.  A World Without Heaven sticks out as a strong, almost progressive rock type song.  Us Against the World is a solid ballad.  Eyes of the Young definitely has a bit of an 80s vibe to it.\n\nMy major complaint is the production of the album.  It just sounds muddy and bland.\n\nNow while this album doesn't break any new ground I find it an enjoyable hard rock album.  Better production and maybe stronger vocals would have made it even more enjoyable.  Personally I see this album as something that grows on you as you get past the Maiden expectation.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"\"A Star Danced\" is the exciting follow-up to David Wahler's award-winning 2009 debut, \"Antiquus.\" Wahler was recently named \"Best New Artist\" in Zone Music Reporter's annual awards, and his new release firmly establishes him in the forefront of the new age, ambient, and contemporary instrumental genres. A variety of moods and emotions are expressed in the thirteen instrumental tracks which Wahler performed on keyboards (sampled instruments just keep getting better. I was sure the horn on tracks 1 and 13 was \"real\"!); the only other musician is guitarist Brent Gunter, who appears on track 3. Where \"Antiquus\" was inspired by ancient myths and oracles, \"A Star Danced\" goes inward to reflect on the personal experiences of the composer. Graceful, dreamy, and beautifully recorded, the music is very personal yet easily accessible through common life experience and the universal language of music.\n\n\"A Star Danced\" begins and ends with \"Quest,\" a musical tale that starts with the ethereal sounds of a dream. A short time later, much of the lead is played on horn (flugelhorn or trumpet), which gives the piece a colorful, cinematic sound. The tone of the piece suggests that the quest is ongoing, without a distinct conclusion in sight, but that the journey itself is the most important part of a quest. The title track is much more ethereal and ambient, creating a vision of dark deep space, slow movement, and twinkling stars - a massage for the mind. I love \"The Seeds of Time,\" which features Brent Gunter on guitar. Ambient sounds, haunting flute, and gentle voices provide an atmospheric backdrop for the beautiful guitar work. \"Come Gentle Night\" is an invocation to dream in blissful tranquility. I have a strong feeling that Debussy would be very pleased with Wahler's electronic arrangement of his \"Reverie.\" The spirit of the original piece is very much intact, updated with contemporary instrumentation and sensibility. \"Sigh Away Sunday\" is pure rapture set to music, putting the weekday cares and worries a million miles away. \"Vespera\" is my favorite track, reminding me of George Skaroulis at his evocative best. Magic and mystery blended with a touch of melancholy create a mood of passion and deep longing. Wow! \"Missing You\" was composed and performed for Wahler's father's funeral - a beautiful tribute that overflows with tenderness and love. I also really like \"A Rose Distilled,\" an ambient piece with guitar, flute, harp, oboe and chimes that floats on a cloud of soothing sound. This is another fantastic album from David Wahler!\n\nIt looks like we're in the midst of another awesome year for new music, and \"A Star Danced\" is likely to be near the top of the pile of great albums! Very highly recommended!","classification":5,"fold":5}

Rapsody performs nicely with beautiful direction, positive content, and a solid flow but she is not particularly interesting to listen to.

{"text":"The cover of this album shows Rob Zombie with no makeup, no painted background, and no vibrant red and hellish colors.  This album properly reflects the nature of this album.  Rob takes away the theatrical he's known for, the movie clips, the crazy circus feel, and creates a smarter and darker album.  This was a risky move, and in many ways is more of a chance than most musicians take.  Luckily, Rob, knowing his career in movies is going well, doesn't have to play by the rules to make something he's interested in.  The trouble is that most music fans like the same thing, again and again, and want the old rob. Which is a shame as this album has a lot to like, but its something that requires a little understanding and a little more patience.  What is ultimately found is an excellent album, with some great music.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Prime Cuts: Beautiful Offerings, Come Sit Down, Good Good Father\n\nWhen Big Daddy Weave named their much anticipated seventh studio album \"Beautiful Offerings,\" it's not hyperbole. These songs are truly \"beautiful\" in the sense that they are contemplative, reflective, and deftly crafted with lyrics that scratches behind the superficial veneer.  And they are \"offerings,\" in the sense that they are paeans of our heartfelt struggles and praises offered as worship to the Almighty God.  Rather than going the steely EDM gauze route, they have opted to let the acoustics of warmer instruments such as the acoustic guitar, banjos, and the gentle pull of strings pave a more tepid feel for what is Big Daddy Weave's most reflective record.  This is not to say that this album has no feet moving moments, it's just that ballads are at fore this time round.\n\nBig Daddy Weave is one of the top artists in Christian music: they are one of the genre's biggest headlining artists, the second most played artist at Christian AC-Monitored radio in 2014 and the recipient of multiple industry awards and nominations, including: Dove Awards, K-LOVE Fan Awards, Billboard Music Awards and ASCAP Awards. With a brand-new studio album, entitled Beautiful Offerings, coming September 18, 2015, the band's latest and career best-selling album, Love Come To Life, celebrated four consecutive No. 1 singles along with recent news that \"Redeemed\" has been certified gold by the RIAA. Big Daddy Weave has career album sales of more than one million units. Formed in 2002, Big Daddy Weave is: Mike Weaver, Jay Weaver, Jeremy Redmon, Joe Shirk, and Brian Beihl.\n\nWith an orchestrated grandeur of strings leading the way, the title cut \"Beautiful Offerings\" is worship at its best.  Rather than coming to God with a puff-up chest, \"Beautiful Offerings\" finds a broken protagonist coming with his tatters to God for healing again.  \"My Story,\" co-written by Mike Weaver and uber songwriter Jason Ingram, is a powerhouse testimony of God's transformative grace wrapped in the fabric of a true-to-life narrative.  \"Lion and the Lamb\" is perhaps this record's theological heavyweight.  It wrestles with the Biblical image of how the Savior is both the lion as well as the lamb; a thought that can blow our minds to nothing but worship.  Mike Weaver gets the most intimate with his emotionally nuanced rasp on the piano-led \"Come Sit Down.\"\n\nHowever, tedium does make a cameo two thirds into the record.  The predominance of overwrought ballads coming perhaps from a small cluster of songwriters has a way of making some of the songs sound similar especially when you are listening to the record for the first few times.  The songs are not ropey; it's just that some of the songs are easy for our concentration to slide.  However, if you do purchase the deluxe version the to-be classic \"Good Good Father\" gives some traction as it gets us singing along with the guys.  And deluxe version's penultimate track \"Jesus I Believe\" is a not-to-be-missed: it is honest, gripping, and so Christ-focused.  \"Beautiful Offerings\" may have its weak spots, but at least it lives up to its titular.  The majority of the songs are beautiful and a pleasing offering to Jesus.","classification":4,"fold":5}

Originally from their certified gold-selling album \"As The Band Turns\" and here from the album \"Ultimate Collection, Atlantic Starr\", this is the R&B, soul supergroup \"Atlantic Starr\", which was a hot group on soul and quiet storm radio stations in the 1980s, featuring the Lewis brothers: David on vocal\/guitar, Wayne on vocals\/keyboards, and Jonathan on trombone\/percussion; Joseph Phillips on flute\/ percussion, and Barbara Weathers on vocals.\n\nThis is a \"specially-remixed\", extended-time version of the hit song \"Silver Shadow\", written by David and Wayne Lewis who also co-produced it with brother Jonathan. The song is built on a latin-tinged beat and a recurring 4-note riff with driving, elastic bass and drum beats, with lyrics sung by the clear, sweet, soft, and supple voice of Weathers who really turns up the heat on the final verse as she delivers the message starting with \"since I was chosen among the rest\". Then the song goes into a series of vamps to the end that are not on the original album or radio versions. Highly Recommended. Five DETERMINED Stars. (A&M records. 1-MP3 track.

{"text":"I've been sorting through boxes of old Christmas albums and commenting on most that are listed here at Amazon, lamenting the fact that many have never been re-mastered for conversion to CD, since these were the ones us old duffers recall most fondly. But my surprise at some of the ones overlooked now has a Number 1 in my book: Christmas Carols by Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra which first came out in 1958 as mono Dot 3148 containing: White Christmas; It Came Upon A Midnight Clear; O Holy Night; Deck The Halls; The First Noel; Joy To The World; Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful); Silent Night; God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen; O Tannenbaum (O Christmas Tree); Hark! The Herald Angels Sing; Faith Of Our Fathers; Jingle Bells; O Little Town Of Bethlehem.\n\nThat original album had the yellow cover seen here with a stylized drawing of a sleigh ride inside a large red oval (which made it a bit odd that Sleigh Ride itself was not among the tracks). In 1959 the same album came out in stereo (Dot 3148\/25148), and when re-issued a few years later with new covers, it made it to # 145 on Billboard's Christmas charts in 1962, and # 101 in 1967.\n\nSome of these tracks have appeared on these CDs: Christmas With Billy Vaughn & His Yuletide Orchestra - 9 of the same tracks in a 10-track 2006 release that includes Auld Lang Syne (not part of the original); Christmas Classics, a 1996 release from Chicago Music Company that contains the same 10 sides; and Christmas Song, a 2012 release from Essential Media Group containing the same line-up. None of these include God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen or White Christmas, nor can I say with any certainty that they are all the same original 1958 renditions.\n\nWhy that has never been re-mastered for CD is a puzzle since Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra wasn't just some run-of-the-mill band back then. After being part of the highly-successful Dot quartet known as The Hilltoppers, who had 15 hit singles for the label from 1952 to 1954, he left to form the in-house Dot orchestra in 1954 that would go on to back the vast majority of Dot artists on so many hit singles and albums (e.g. Pat Boone, Gail Storm, The Fontane Sisters, Tab Hunter, Nick Todd (Pat Boone's brother), and many more for years to come.\n\nIn the midst of all that, he and his orchestra would rack up some 31 hit singles of their own for Dot from their first, Melody Of Love in late 1954\/early 1955, to their last in 1967, I Love You (And You Love Me), while selling albums in the millions. Four of those went Gold: The Golden Instrumentals (1956); Sail Along Silv'ry Moon (1958); Blue Hawaii (1959); and Theme From A Summer Place (1960).\n\nA great deal of his music is available on CD, so why are they dragging their heels with his premier Christmas album?","classification":4,"fold":5}
{"text":"This is probably John Lennon's best and most remembered song.  Granted, there have been many outstanding lyrics written by him as a Beatle either individually or in partnership with Paul - both ballads like 'If I Fell' to the deep lyrics of 'A Day In The Life', etc, but Imagine seems to say so much in so easy to understand words ...... thoughts about mankind, sharing, love, harmony, life the way John may have wished it could be and should be...... Imagine has been copied by many other artists and is probably the most 'popular' or 'covered' songs done during 'Beatle Week' on American Idol.  Just about every year one of the Idol hopefuls is singing Imagine - the best, in my opinion, by David Archuletta.  Outside of Idol, I've heard even Charlotte Church sing it during a charity concert - she did it in her usual high soprano voice but the lyrics and meaning came out powerful and clear, just the way John wrote them.  A classic song by one of music's lyrical genuises......","classification":5,"fold":5}

She mostly recorded cover versions of recent pop hits.  She often went off-pitch, and sometimes she fell behind (or got ahead of) the beat.  She sang with more vibrato than Tiny Tim, and occasionally she would perform bird whistles.  Of course, the whole thing was a joke by the record company.  It's pretty funny, although it wears a bit thin after a while.  I don't think too many people can take 21 songs by Mrs. Miller!

{"text":"1973 was a banner year for the dead; with many high points well documented in official and bootleg releases;; that summer was the legendary watkins glen concert. more great shows followed through the fall with the winterland run being perhaps the crowning glory. yet here we are just days later ready to enjoy a show that's been revered for years by dead heads.. u.c.l.a. this wasn't their first show at pauley pavilion nor would it be their last.tonight the band is featuring several songs off their newest album,,, wake of the flood,,one of the sweetest, thoughtful, dare i say, spiritual albums the band ever released..liner notes are written by famous dead head and ucla basketball player ,, bill walton. he does a good job describing the vibe around this dead show and the bands history at this venue, as well as touching on life around the band and california at the time. as he was personal friends with the band,,it is very insightful.. this show has been on archives for a long time for fans to enjoy; but the sound on this new cd is way better than one would imagine. dave and his friends have done a great job cleaning everything up.  jerry and bobby take turns leading us through a nice first set. special mention to a well played deal,tennessee jed, and a very sweet, china\/rider at almost 15 minutes is a cool 1st set jam. the real special moment is the , here comes sunshine..jerry reaches out his hand and leads us down this magic  trail, into an adventure land of music wonder..a beautiful song.. disc 2 highlights a massive playing in the band jam which is one of only three times they ever played this song sandwich..jerry gets that guitar sound going like only he can, during a playing jam, and off we go to uncle johns band, morning dew and back again... 50 minutes of a great dead jam. disc 3. stella blue is played so soft and sweet, and the eyes of the world is wonderful  with large doses of sweet jerry guitar , beautiful piano , keith sounds great throughout;; as usual the phil\/bill duo is holding down the rhythm section with great style and precision.  what a great concert !! i am so glad dave put this out,,in his intro. on dead.net he says this could be a top 25 show for all time. i would say there is enough high points to at least give it consideration. if you like the sound the band discovered this year with a softer,jazzy texture to it that defined there style during 1973, i think you will love adding this show to your collection...","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Fantastic album by Kevin Parker. I remember the first time I heard it... The year 2013... I had a shed in my backyard that was commonly known as the birdhouse (my last name is Bird) so I was in there a lot with friends, or my sister, or just by myself chilling with a bag of Jane. It was summer, I had just walked home from school and got this album on my phone, so I went in my room and got my speakers and all the \"stuff\" went to the shed and got down to business. Then I put this album on and sat back to just fly with the music, a lovely journey it was. Great album, lots of memories with it in that summer hiking and driving around. It was also probably the first modern album I was into since like 7th grade.... I was only into 60s-70s music at the time so this album changed my opinion on modern music and forced me to delve into all kinds of newer music. Good stuff","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Though not a true concept album like Operation: Mindcrime, Promised Land is an engaging conceptual-esque song cycle unified by simarily themed songs and myriad sound effects. From the opening collage of 9:28 AM we get right into the \"story\" with I Am I, which, along with The Bridge, was a minor album rock radio hit. Other standout tracks include Out of Mind, the epic title track, One More Time, and the personal, moving closing track Someone Else? which is made all the more poignant as it's arrangement consists solely of piano and Geoff Tate's world-class vocals. This is possibly the band's best set of lyrics ever, they are, for the most part, intensely personal, moving, and, at times, uplifting. Out of Mind, with it's conveyings of guilt and the sense of perspective it gives you, and the all too typical father\/son story in The Bridge are the standouts in the lyrical department. The music and overall arrangements are also the best and most dense that Queensryche has ever put together. Though not their top album (that honor still belings to Mindcrime) this is one of their most interesting, and certainly one of their best.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Cleaning their sound up a bit while still maintaining their status as one of our best jam bands, \"The Waterfall\" finds My Morning Jacket relaxing into a great groove. There are plenty of Jim James' soaring falsetto and guitar hero chops, like on \"Spring (Among The Living).\" (I've seen MMJ three times now and can attest that he's a monster live.) From the bubbly synth that opens \"Believe (Nobody Knows)\" to the extended play out of \"Only Memories Remain,\" this is the My Morning Jacket album that takes the experiments aside and concentrates on the band's strengths, much like \"Circuital\" did. And since they decided to stretch out of their comfort zone and record in the sunny spaces of California instead of the hallowed grain silo, it seems like a little California sunshine and polish made its mark on the boys.\n\nThey ponder nature (\"In Its Infancy\"), flirt with folk rock (\"Tropics\") and even commit to a relatively straightforward break up song (\"Get The Point\"). There is still a wall of sound aspect to the band, yet this time their seems to be a buffing away of some of the rougher edges. But it's always been the cascades of sound that has been the main attraction of My Morning Jacket. Their combination of folk, psychedelia, and instrumental prowess is one of many reasons that MMJ are one of the most interesting American bands currently making music. It's also soulful; the inspiring \"Thin Line\" and \"Only Memories Remain\" are cases in point. The band still keeps to their path of eclecticism and we're all the richer for it.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"I love Jackyl as a band. Great swagger, good riffs, and a monster sound with the trademark country sarcasm. Always liked them and will continue to. That said this is not a terrible CD at all, but has definitely has a few duds.\n\nQuick Breakdown:\n\nLove the first 3 tracks. The title song is an excellent blend of Aerosmith riffs meets Jackyl with a memorable chorus. Great opening song. Track 2, (Encore) is the sing-a-long, catchy, 'stripper' style tracks works well, even with its cheesy lyrics. Can see it being a fun crowd interaction song live. 'Screwdriver' is great until the last minute where it seems to drag a bit. Then the water gets murkier. 'Horns Up' is decent except for the stupid chorus. But its ok. 'Golden Spookytooth' is, again, ok.\n\nThere is a solid cover version of 'Cover of The Rolling Stone' done with solid Jackyl swagger while still true to the original. \"Walk My Mile' has a sincere Vocal delivery by JJD, but ultimately comes up flat in the chorus department and 'Favorite Sin' is pretty cliche. Sounds like you heard it before.\n'Better than Chicken' is about as good as the title suggests, but is a typical JJD spoof track from a rant he always liked saying. Its fun. 'Don't Lay Down on Me' is 'When Moonshine and Dynamite Collides' baby brother. Same vibe, chord style and chorus structure, just not quite as good. 'Eleven' starts just exactly like 'Push Comes to Shove', its ok, but the chorus of 'everything goes to eleven' is pretty... well, i don't know. Lyrically the track is challenged we will just say that. I feel stupider when listening to it.\n\nIf you are thinking of going out of your way to get the bonus version, as I did, track 12 is a slow paced track that isn't bad, but falls kind of flat. sounds like a song that had potential but never reached its peak. But track 14, 'Its Tricky' is a remake of that frigging rap song with the Jackyl treatment, just leaves me wondering 'WHY!!!\". Very bad and unnecessary. Ends the CD badly.\nAgain, thats only if you get the bonus track version. But I really wouldn't go out of my way for these tracks. Get the bonus version only if you want the DVD that's included (that I have not viewed yet). In fact, this is a good example of a CD to buy certain tracks. Buy 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 10.\n\n60% of the CD is good, but some of it just doesn't work. Its definitely not as good as 'When Moonlight and Dynamite Collide', but still has some great, spirited Jackyl moments and some catchy songs. Just be prepared to hit the skip button.\n\nBUT, still love this band.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"You might say that Tommy Roe was ahead of the curve. He recorded \"bubblegum\" music before the term was even coined. After his wildly successful debut single, 1962's \"Sheila\", Tommy Roe went on to make 21 more appearances on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart over the next decade. A strong argument can be made that his 1966 Top Ten smash \"Sweet Pea\" was really the very first \"bubblegum\" hit. Recall that the term \"bubblegum\" did not appear until the heyday of Buddah records in 1968-1969 with groups like Ohio Express and the 1910 Fruitgum Co. At least one reviewer has complained that this is NOT the original recording.  I think he is correct but it really does not vary all that much from the original.

{"text":"Watching BET's Midnight Love one night, I was introduced to a r&b singer named Jaheim.  As I was watching his video, I wasn't too impressed with \"Could It Be\" at first.  I saw the song as just another new cat jumping into the r&b game.  However, as I heard the song more often, I began to like the song more and Jaheim's voice wasn't that bad, as it reminded me of the infamous Teddy P singing \"Love TKO\", \"Turn Off The Lights\", or \"Come Go With Me\".  I was still hesitant in buying \"Ghetto Love\" but everyone that had purchased the CD gave me rave reviews so I decided to purchase my own copy.  \"Ghetto Love\" turned out to be one of my favorite r&b CDs of 2001.  I liked how Jaheim used his sharp \"street\" edge to his songs.  My favorites included \"Looking For Love\", \"Ghetto Love\", \"Remarkable\" w\/Terry Dexter, \"Ready, Willing & Able\", as well as the rest of his singles:  \"Just In Case\" and \"Anything\" w\/Next.  With a title of \"Still Ghetto\" you would expect the same thing from his sophomore CD and ladies and gentlemen that is what you will get.  \"Still Ghetto\" starts off with Jaheim and Duganz doing what they did on a few tracks on \"Ghetto Love\" by rappin' and singin' straight from the streets.  From there, Jaheim does what he does best by lacing his fans with the street anthems and romantic melodies that he is known for now.  His 1st single, \"Fabolous\" is dedicated to the children coming up in the world today.  As Jaheim can tell you, he knows how rough it was growing up and being a hardhead so he is trying to motivate children of today to not walk in the same path that he did.  While the song may not hit you like \"Could It Be\", \"Fabolous\" gets a strong point across and was definintely the right pick for the 1st single.  The majority of the rest of the songs deal with relationships and trying to find the right woman.  The ladies will definitely be impressed with this CD.  \"Diamond In Da Ruff\" deals with a woman that Jaheim wish he would have treated better and now he realizes how much they could have had if he would have swallowed his pride and been a man about their relationship.  \"Let's Talk About It\" follows the same line as Jaheim wants to talk to someone that he dealt with in the past and try to realize where they went wrong.  He was in trouble so much that he couldn't be focused in the relationship.  \"Put That Woman First\" covers territory that has been covered by R Kelly, \"When A Woman's Fed Up\" and Joe, \"Treat Her Like A Lady\".  However, with the old school feel to the song, this will still be one of your favorites.  \"Beauty & Thug\" features the queen of r&b\/hip hop, Mary J Blige and brings pleasant results.  Both singers sound very well together and Malik Pendleton, who produced Mary J. Blige's \"Seven Days\" from her \"Share My World\" CD does the production.  The fellas will be able to relate to \"Tight Jeans\", as Jaheim tells a tale about one of his good female friends always coming around him wearing tight jeans.  While he may have intentions of being a platonic friend, she is tempting him to think of her in other ways.  Jaheim also displays the same sentimental side that he showed on \"Ghetto Love\" with songs like \"Backtight\", \"Special Day\", \"Long As I Live\" and \"Everywhere I Am\".  The latter, is a powerful dedication to his mom who passed away when he was a teenager . On another song, \"Me And My B****\", Jaheim professes his loyalty for his lady, but at the same time he is saying if you try to \"get at her\", that might be the last move you make.  This may be too much for some r&b fans, but if you understand the concept, you will understand that he isn't trying to offend women, this is just his way of expressing his thoughts on this particular song.  If Jaheim would have ended \"Still Ghetto\" at track 13, I believe that he would have a 5 star CD on his hands.  However, tracks 14-16, turn out to be nothing but filler.  Especially, \"Whut You Want\", which puts a damper on 13 straight tight songs.  The majority of the production is handled by Kay Gee, formerly of Naughty By Nature and Eddie F and Darren Lighty, which provides primarily the same sound as his debut CD displayed.  Overall, Jaheim has a nice sophomore CD on his hands.

Cheap music that I could surpass in artistic and equality in twenty minutes and dumb, childish lyrics are a testament to the continuing decline of American intelligence today. This isn't punk or metal at all. This is a horrible travesty to both genres. Metal is ultraheavy guitar riffs with extremenly loud melody and pounding drums. Punk is real rebelism against trends in society. Sum 41 aren't that either. They are nothing but a bunch if talentless clowns who are cashing in on TRL to make a buck [...].\nDon't call me an old fogie who listens to Frank Sinatra or Mozart because I am 19 years old but I have stuck with the moral values that garbage like this encourages youth to dismiss.\nI feel ashamed that people in my age group are more worried about being cool by cussing that than being intelligent.

{"text":"Diiv, like a few other purveyors of everything alternative 80s, are sipping from the cup that runneth over poured by great bands like the Cure, Echo and the Bunneymen, Modern English and Joy Division.  If a band was signed to Sire or 4AD, then more than likely Diiv is echoing their sentiment. But unlike a lot of bands that attempt to capture the spirit of the early days of 80s alternative and fail, Diiv not only capture it, but hone it and make it something they can call their very own.\n\nDiiv is the brainchild of Beach Fossils guitarist Zachary Cole Smith. At first a bedroom project, it's now become much more than that. With clean, reverbed guitars, driving 16th note bass lines and danceable drum beats, this Brooklyn(of course) quartet run through 13 tracks in 40 minutes and never is there a lagging moment. Smith's vocals have an ethereal quality to them. They float along in a haze of echo, indifference and ambiguity.  Understanding lyrics isn't the point here. It's about opening up and just letting the music take you somewhere.\n\nOshin opens with the two minute instrumental '(Druun)', which is really a great way to introduce you to Diiv's headspace.  A reverb-drenched and very atmospheric track, '(Druun)', is the hole in the wall which allows you to take a peak at what's in store. 'Past Lives' sounds a lot like one of Diiv's contemporaries, Real Estate.  Both bands plow the same musical fields, albeit on different continents.  Where Real Estate borrow heavily from IRS-era REM and the like, Diiv are backpacking it through Europe and having a hell of a time doing it. 'How Long Have You Known' is a great, pulsating track in the spirit of Joy Division. 'Earthboy' has buried vocals, cleanly played guitars and drums that hover just above audible volume. You think the song is ending in a wash of guitar and muted distortion when the drums kick back in to help bring the track to it's end. '(Druun pt. II)' returns to the instrumental fold, this time with more of a new wave drive with a hint of Tangerine Dream.\n\nYes, Oshin is very derivative of the past. In particular Joy Division, the Cure, Echo and the Bunnymen and to some extent Cocteau Twins. But if you're going to bask in the past, why not make it the good stuff? If you're into Real Estate, Yuck or even Deerhunter, you'll want to take the dive...and check out Diiv.","classification":4,"fold":5}

Chicagoan Ryley Walker is able to conjure up the sounds of these UK artists circa 1970 with astonishing accuracy.  Walker and his cohorts play with strong chops and are very good at blurring the lines between these influences.  That said, one gets the feeling of tribute here more than harnessing these sounds and talents towards creating something new and fresh.  That also said, it's as good a listen, or better than much of what I have encountered in 2015.  Mr. Walker is one to watch, I hope he sets his talents free next time out and encounters HIS true voice rather than those of his idols.  I believe he has the talent to do something special.","classification":4,"fold":5}

Yeah, a great motorhead album, well then again Motorhead never really made a bad album did they? Moving on...\n\nAs you give the album time it seems to grow better with each listen. As Lemmy's lyrics become more recognizable to you the songs seem better that usual. Lemmy really stepped up the lyrics for Motorizer; they are both very personal and intelligent. His bass playing is exception as well ('When The Eagle Screams') much better than usual. Philip Campbell shows his merit here as well. His Wah-Wah tone makes his guitar scream and his riffs are solid and his solos kill! Mikkey Dee proves once again that he just might be the very best drummer in rock n' roll today. This is really his album.\n\n'Runaround Man' is classic Motorhead destined to be a fan favorite as is 'Rock Out.' The latter being very Ramones influenced adding an extra layer of awesome. 'English Rose' kills just about anything out today and 'The Thousand Names Of God' is among the strongest sets of lyrics Lemmy has ever set to paper. 'When The Eagle Screams' is by far the strongest track on the album. Both musically, and lyrically it destroys.

{"text":"There comes a point where great new artists hit maturity. They find their voices and establish a sound that is recognizable. Their first self-titled was a harmonic but largely serious affair, where they wrote and sang beautifully on albeit controversial subject matter, showcasing their country-esque storytelling ability. Their second album was deeply personal, but the pair also experimented with a fun, quirky style that makes them distinctive.  We have come to know them as so versatile they could elicit tears (\"This Means War\") or uncontrollable grins (theme to Adult Swim's \"Squidbillies\") .  Those lucky enough to see this charismatic pair perform live can see they are a two-person band.  They are multi-instrumentalists who will exchange guitars or drumsticks between songs, or even play two instruments at a time.  They apply the same ethic to their studio recordings.  While this may lead one to expect a small-sound, their music packs a big punch.  Their sounds have filled huge outdoor stadiums like Berkeley's Greek Theater, and the same effect is heard on this latest album.  With Swimming Time, they join the record label Dualtone (under which The Lumineers are also signed), which is known for its respect of its artists' artistic independence, and for Shovels and Rope, their mastery shows fully here.\n\nSwimming Time is a masterful combination of quirk and breathtaking beauty. As for vocals, they have always been consistent: Cary Ann Hearst is sometimes charming, sometimes soaring, along the lines of Dolly Parton; Michael Trent is powerful and barebones, and brings a substantial rock-infused element from his days as frontman to the band The Films. Together they have an instantly recognizable sound: harmonies here are impeccable and you can't have one singer without the other; melodies are interwoven giving each song a brilliant texture, a perfect marriage with folk, country, rock, and more.\n\nThe standout track is \"After the Storm\", which will probably be recognized as one of Shovels and Ropes' best tracks, and is a masterpiece of songwriting. At over 6 minutes, the track has pathos and complexity that speak heartfelt on hope and tragedy (Hearst introduced the song at live shows before Swimming Time was released, and she noted that it was written to commemorate a real-life event - the tornadoes of Oklahoma City). The chorus is a substantial one that meanders between major and minor key, and features harmonized vocals that steadily rise, giving the chorus a building, tense crescendo that finally ends in the major key, a symbol of hope. The sound is reminiscent of \"All Those Words\" from Trent's solo album, which the pair performed as a Duo later on.  Hearst and Trent took the best of that live performance of \"All Those Words\" and reworked them into an anthem for optimism.  Had Shovels and Rope only ever released this one song, it alone would make the pair worthy of longstanding recognition.\n\nWhile their debut album was a darker affair, \"After the Storm\" and the lilting \"Save the World\" outline Hearst and Trent's vision of redemption.\n\nTracks such as \"Bridge on Fire\" firmly establish Shovels and Rope within a tradition of folk\/country artists while also representing how the genre has evolved.  The harmonies at the words \"I want you to know what you're walking away from\" and the subsequent chord progressions are nothing short of a masterclass of songwriting.  \"Evil\" is very much in the style of the pair's blues-inspired tracks like \"Tickin' Bomb\".\n\nThey effectively use new rhythms, such as in the title track, which features vocals in the chorus that almost remind the listener of a hip-hop inspired syncopation. There is an air of genre blending which makes the album eclectic enough to reach wide audiences but faithful enough to maintain it's folk-country roots.\n\nShovels and Rope also inject some humor into the album, such as the endearing \"Mary Ann and One Eyed Dan\", but nonetheless balancing it tastefully with the serious -- their lyric writing is exemplary.  There are of course, rollicking fun tracks such as \"Fish Assassin\", which is reminiscent of \"Kemba's Got the Cabbage Moth Blues\". This album shows the pair at their most versatile.\n\nThey end the record with \"Thresher\", another substantial track which, at almost 7 minutes long, draws you in with its cinematic storytelling and emotional vocals.  Hearst and Trent's lyric writing brilliantly evokes the imagery of shipwreck: \"pirouette into the arms of the ocean floor\".  In their previous album \"O' Be Joyful\" they closed the album with a similarly paced track, also in triple meter - like a funeral dirge.  It is a wholly satisfying way to end this emotional roller coaster of an album, bringing the whole thing to reflective and quiet resolution.\n\nHighly reccomended.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Evidently the title \"Simple Plan\" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, \"Time To Say Goodbye.\" It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer\/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block. This becomes all the more apparent because Britney Spears' songwriting team was brought in to write several songs, making Simple Plan sound like a boy band. Even when they try to rock out, the production is so overdone that the guitars seem distorted and out of place. And there are WAY too many piano-ballads. I think any trace of the faux-punk label they were slapped with after their first two albums, which were decent efforts packed with pop-punk hooks, can permanently be removed now. Simple Plan will spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was the three-plus year layoff between albums or the change of sound\/style on this new one that killed their career. And the answer is neither. It is the lack of originality, energy, and songcraft that will do them in. Lets face it, when Hilary Duff rocks harder than you, your band is not \"punk.\" And in the three and a half years this band was away, the scene changed, but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band calls \"unchartered musical territory.\" Perhaps \"UnCHARTED\" musical territory is more like it.

{"text":"I first heard of Feel Good Drag (Album Version) by Anberlin  (from New Surrender) during the summer of 2009. Ironically enough, I was living in Orlando, Florida during this time and heard this song playing on my alarm clock radio. I was also fortunate in being able to hear them live at a concert arena affiliated with George Mason University (back around April 2011) because they were opening for 30 Seconds To Mars. This catchy hard rock song appears to be about a female who captures the interest of the singer, but seems to be juggling romantic affairs with two different men at a time. I admit that I tried to catch the meaning of the song through the video, but became even more unsure of the meaning. Nonetheless, Feel Good Drag by Anberlin is good for those who are open to hearing hard rock songs that capture the complexities\/highs and lows of love triangles.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"In 1996, following a fight with the group, the thrash metal band Sepultura lost their vocalist and rhythm guitarist. Max Cavalera, the member who left the band, formed another band, Soulfly in 1998.\n\nOver the course of their six albums with Cavalera, Sepultura evolved pretty far. With each passing album, they became more and more creative and experimental, but (in my opinion) they also became less and less heavy. Therefore, everybody (or every metalhead, at least) eagerly awaited Soulfly's self-entitled debut. Would it pick up where Sepultura left off, or would it be a rehash of a past Sepultura album, or would Max start over, from the beginning, and make Soulfly have a completely new sound?\n\nWell, aside from being heavier, angrier, and more energetic, \"Soulfly\" pretty much picks up where 1996's \"Roots\" left off. This album doesn't expand on or evolve Sepultura's sound, but it still has plenty of new and refreshing ingredients and sounds.\n\n\"Eye for an Eye\" is one of Soulfly's better known songs. It's the opening track on this record and the first of three relentlessly heavy tracks. The first ten seconds are a buzzing sound, but then the floodgates open with very heavy guitar riffs which groove and pounding drums.\n\n\"No Hope=No Fear\" begins with an ascending yell, before it becomes a demolishing beat with surging riffs.\n\n\"Bleed\" begins with a drum beat and some light, almost wah-wah guitar noise, then Max makes another screaming entrance and the song explodes. Then Fred Durst makes his cameo, yells \"Bring it on!,\" and begins rapping. This song is OK, but the rap part of this song doesn't really\n\nfit.\n\nThe first minute of \"Tribe\" is an acoustic guitar with some guy singing in a foreign language (maybe African). The drums, and eventually the power chords and vocals begin, and the song jumps in volume. The guitars turn out heavy churning riffs and the drums sound like tin cans.\n\n\"Bumba\" begins with the sound of a rainstorm, before turning to chug and churn riffs and vocals which are in Spanish.\n\n\"First Commandment\" has more crunchy riffs, but, about halfway through, it becomes a light interlude with tribal drums and (Deftones frontman's) Chino Moreno's dreary vocals. Max Cavalera made a guest appearance on the Deftones 1997 album, \"Around the Fur,\" so Chino repays Max for it by making a cameo on this album.\n\n\"Bumbklaatt\" is another very angry track. The beat\/song becomes full volume following a guttural yell by Max at the beginning, and the rest of the song is a very catchy rhythm with good drum work.\n\n\"Soulfly\" is an instrumental with tribal drums and some light guitar strums. It's a nice, peaceful track, but it's also kind of forgettable and not as creative as later Soulfly instrumentals.\n\n\"Umbabarauma\" is maybe the catchiest song on the album. It opens with a yell of \"Un, dos, tres, cua!,\" then some half volume guitars and a catchy drum pattern kick in, but this song is really a highlight because of the great chant\/shout along of \"Umbabarauma!\"\n\n\"Quilombo\" has angry vocals, but the instruments buzz along at only half volume.\n\n\"Fire\" has more fast, plowing riffs, but they break briefly and the song becomes a drum beat with dwindling, twinkling guitar strings. But an ascending yell and some more heavy riffs bring the song back to full volume. Most of this song (except for the very beginning and end) is an instrumental.\n\n\"The Song Remains Insane\" begins with the sound of a TV, with two people who talk, in Spanish, about \"Sepultura\" and \"Max Cavalera.\" The song itself, though, is a super loud, pounding beat with more heavy yells.\n\nThe second half of \"No\" is an instrumental. The first half has a throat straining yell and more churning riffs, but the second half has a weird guitar noise and jazzy drumming.\n\n\"Prejudice\" gains momentum well and has good vocal hooks.\n\n\"Karmageddon\" has almost spacey guitar notes and a repetitive drum pattern. Then, following a half a minute of silence, there are more tribal drums alongside some female vocals.\n\nThis album is essential for all Sepultura fans and Max freaks, and if you're looking for an heavy, hard hitting, energetic listen, check this album out. Expect a great listen, but don't expect this album to be a classic, like Sepultura's \"Beneath the Remains\" or \"Arise.\" And don't listen to it if you're the type of person who gets headaches easily.","classification":5,"fold":5}
{"text":"The first time I heard this song, my attention was caught as soon as the phrase \"Your everlasting arms\" came up. That's from Deut. 33:27: \"The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee...\" I love references to Jesus as the everlasting God and as our Protector who bare us on eagle's wings. He is the one who would gather us as an eagle gathers her nestlings under her wings, safe and sound, if only we would come to him. (Deut. 32:11-12; Luke 13:34)\n\nBesides being an upbeat tune, it has clever lyrics. \"Where would I be with You ... I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way... I'd be buildin' my kingdom just to watch it fade away.\"\n\nWhat's refreshing about these lyrics is they are so true and most people don't want to admit it. Without the Lord, they are as children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine.\n\nIt reminds me of the Lord telling us not to chase after riches that rust and corrode. Peter said that we should seek after the inheritance incorruptible that fades not away, for it is reserved in heaven. He meant to seek after the Lord.\n\nOur hope in Christ can never be taken from us. It's the only true treasure, and it lasts forever.\n\nGreat song!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"\"It is time for a love revolution\" is retro rocker Lenny Kravitz's eighth studio album, and along with \"5\" is my favourite. At #4 in the US, it's his second highest charting album (his Greatest Hits got to #2) and his highest charting studio effort.\n\nAnnouncing that it is time for a love revolution is upbeat rocker \"Love revolution\" (with spiritual lyrics). Still on the upbeat side of things are \"Bring it on\" with a blistering guitar riff, and some sitar from Anishka Shankar (Norah Jones' sister), the thumping \"Love love love\", which along with the brilliant dance\/rock of \"Dancin' til dawn' (with a nice sax solo; one of my favourites) wouldn't sound out of place on a Red Hot Chili Peppers album. For \"Will you marry me\", I was expecting to hear a ballad. What we get is James Brown meets Jimi Hendrix; a retro funk song with skittery beats and heavy electric guitar. Great! \"Back in Vietnam\" has a riff vaguely reminiscent of the Rolling Stone's \"Satisfaction\".\n\nSlowing things down are the chugging \"Good morning\", the lightly country tinged \"If you want it\", the lovely piano sprinkled \"I'll be waiting\" (remember \"Again\"?), the awesome melancholic \"I love the rain\" with fantastic weeping guitar riffs, the introspective theatrical \"A long and sad goodbye\" (a beautiful epic ballad about the impact his father's leaving after divorce had on the family, as well as the effect of his recent death on Lenny - Papa you meant the world to me, why did you abandon me?) which has a fantastic guitar solo at the end, much like The Eagle's \"Hotel California\", the soulful \"This moment is all there is\", the stripped piano Beatles-esque \"A new door\" (with again spiritual lyrics), and the soulful \"I want to go home\".\n\nThe Japanese version has 2 bonus tracks which are both brilliant; the reggae tinged falsetto sung \"Uncharted terrain\". Remember Terence Trent D'arby's 1987 hit \"Sign your name\"? It's a bit like that. The other is the blues song \"Confused\" with a great guitar solo and impassioned soulful vocals.\n\nProduced and mostly played by Lenny, this album is amazing. It is time for a Lenny Kravitz revolution.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I get that Bjork is a unique, original innovator, unlike most in the business. BUT, I do believe she is an acquired taste. To me, her earlier solo work like 1993's \"Debut\", 1995's \"Post\" and 1997's \"Homogenic\" was more accessible, and more straightforward. Until now. \"Vulnicura\" chronicles the dissolution of her marriage and her nuclear family unit. She sets a tone on the album that is somber and reflective. It's some of her best writing.\n\nBut, the music...well, an acquired taste, right? There are nine tracks here, but seven of them are over six minutes, with one being ten minutes and two eight minutes. I believe that if you are going to make long songs you should make them interesting. I get that Bjork made meditative works here, but I'd rather reach for my best progressive rockers like Yes, ELP, Genesis or King Crimson. Some of the tracks here on \"Vulnicura\" over-stay their welcome such as \"Lionsong\", \"Family\", \"Atom Dance\" and \"Mouth Mantra\".\n\nI guess, in this case, I would just like the old Bjork back. The woman who was experimental AND exciting. That seems long gone in her music now. There'll be no \"Big Time Sensuality\" any time soon, or \"I Miss You\" or \"It's Oh So Quiet\". I'd like Bjork to do an upbeat album sometime in the near future. I know she has at least one left. For the past decade she has been rather maudlin and morose, generally speaking.\n\nI got the digipak version. The artwork is excellent, but that's to be expected, isn't?\n\nHere's how \"Vulnicura\" compares to Bjork's previous works:\n\nThe Sugarcubes:\n\n1988 Life's Too Good: Four Stars\n1989 Here Today Tomorrow: Three Stars\n1992 Stick Around For Joy: Three and a Half Stars\n\nBjork:\n\n1993 Debut: Three Stars\n1995 Post: Five Stars\n1997 Homogenic: Five Stars\n2000 Selmasongs: Three Stars\n2001 Vespertine: Four Stars\n2004 Medulla: Two and a Half Stars\n2007 Volta: Three and a Half Stars\n2011 Biophilia: Three and a Half Stars\n2015 Vulnicura: Three and a Half Stars","classification":3,"fold":5}

In addition, the song won Gladys Knight & The Pips a Grammy award for \"R&B Vocal Group\" of the year. Quite an accomplishment for a group that had been around for 40 years. I think you will agree that \"Love Overboard\" is one of the funkiest songs the group ever recorded.  Definitely worthy of a full five stars!","classification":5,"fold":5}

They have produced an exceptionally good debut album and I think they have the talent to last for a long time.

Because of the picture on the cover, I was a little concerned the music would be too relaxing to use at work, but the music was interesting, so I didn't find that to be a challenge.\n\nOne slight drawback of the collection is that the composers are not listed.  The artist listed is the symphony, orchestra or soloist responsible for interpreting the music of the composer.  I would have liked to know the composer on a couple of these items.

{"text":"You know what to expect from Elton John, some nice, lush ballads, a few uptempo numbers and a little bit of rock. Nice melodies, mot so much passion, but a lyrics sheet that, no matter how one tried, could not find a single reference to his sexuality, except Big Dipper.\n\nAnd so 'The Fox' goes, his usual servings of pop, still using self-serving metaphors (But 'The Fox' is a long way to plummet from 'Captain Fantastic' don't ya think?) (And who's fault is this anyway, It's not as if Elton writes the lyrics, or does he?? Did Bernie Taupin really bestowe the crown of 'Captain Fantastic' on Elton, while relegating himself to role of 'Brown dirt cowboy'?)\n\nBut The Fox is a surprise. Although it is not an experimental album, fairly straight-forward, it is still a very inspired album. From the sleazy-journo ode 'Heart's in the right p;ace' to classical music 'Carla Etude' and the all-our rocking opener 'Breaking down barriers', the songs on 'The Fox' are very solid and enjoyable. There is also a lot of diversity here too. Rating 3 1\/2 or 3 3\/4 or something like that, worth rounding up.\n\nBut if you are hoping for a return to his country-rock days; you'll be disappointed, you'll have to wait for the last song and even then you won't get any humility: \"And for mile after mile you'll never see me tire\nYou'll never see me slow down, for a while\n'Cause I am the fox, like it or not\".\nBut who wants humility in their rock music anyway?

{"text":"I hated to rate Kid Rock's last album \"Born Free\" so low, but nothing on that album stood out to me as something that would be a classic, it may have gone to #1 in the US and done fairly well around the world, but that was fans anticipation that Kid's latest album would be great, but the proof is seen in how many songs you remember now, how many have radio play, how many clips where made and remembered and the singles chart positions.\n\nI am glad Kid Rock abandoned using Rick Ruban's help to produce this album, as it does sound a bit more like Kid Rock now. However, I was excited to not only hear that, but that Kid wanted this album to be something more like \"Cocky\" which to me is one of his best albums yet where I enjoy listening to that album almost from start to finish. But what has been the outcome here on \"Rebel Soul\" has been rather disappointing for me.\n\nThe opening song \"Chickens In The Pen\" is not a strong opener, nor is it a great song. Usually upon hearing the first track of an album, it sets the mood for what is about to come, but like on \"Born Free\" the first track here made my heart sink that this album was not going to put Kid back on top of his game. The lyrics are too weird for me to even understand what Kid was going for on this track. I thought maybe it would be tongue in cheek lyrics, but \"the mule keeps kickin' the chickens in the pen, Let's rock all night and then do it again\" I dunno... I just expect better from Kid Rock. The song is just too stupid to be good if you ask me.\n\nLets Ride - it sounds like Kid has taken a real liking to the 60's and 70's sound of Rock N roll bands like 'The Who' and 'Alice Cooper'. It's certainly not a bad thing at all, however the song comes off sounding pretty average for it's genre.\n\nCatt Boogie - About the same as \"Lets Ride\", its decent, but not all that memorable.\n\nDetroit Michigan - OK, KID. WE GET IT ALREADY, YOU ARE FROM DETROIT, BUT PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE stop singing about it. The lyrics sound good, the melody is pretty good, up until the chorus, it just doesn't sit right in the song. A song that could have been good, but he does a better job with this type of thing later on the album.\n\nRebel Soul - I expected a title like this to be southern rock, but it sounds country to me. Kid's done some great country songs, but this song here to me is not worthy of naming the whole album after. Definitely a filler sounding track.\n\nGod Save Rock N Roll - What is Kid thinking these days? First Rebel Soul is not southern rock, yet this one here has ROCK N ROLL in the title and is a country tune? Next.\n\nHappy New Year - This is a cover song? Why did Kid chose to cover this song? It's pretty simple lyrics, and i'm convinced Kid can do much better then this. I was surprised to see this song was leading the votes of favorite song from this album on Kid's website... why, I just don't know?\n\nCelebrate - Not a bad song, but like track 2 and 3, it is easy to forget, but amongst the rest of this album, it's one of the better ones on here.\n\nThe Mirror - I absolutely hate auto-tuners. Kid doesn't need to use them, and ruined what could have been a decent slow song had he not used those annoying stupid auto-tuners that should be banned from anyone being able to record with. I did say something the same on Alice Cooper's last album, and was informed that it was an effect and not an auto-tuner, so if that's the case with this song too, then Bathroom Bobby, never EVER use that effect ever again, it sounds horrible.\n\nMr Rock N Roll - I was losing faith that there wasn't going to be a stand out song on this album, and i'd be reviewing it the same way I did Kid's last album, but Mr Rock N Roll showed up and brightened my day. I wouldn't say this song is 5 of 5 stars, but it's around the 4 mark. It's my favorite track on this album, and easy to get into and rock with. The lyrics are great, has a lot of familiar names of classic songs in it, and is worthy of Kid adding this track to his live shows.\n\nCucci Galore - At first I thought, WTF is this $#!%? lyrics spewing out of \"My names Cucci, Cucci, Cucci galore\" and repeating. Then a screaming rock chorus of \"Do you wanna go down\"... the song makes little sense to me other than it's a typical Kid Rock bragging about having money, fame, women and hot tubs etc... but as weird as the lyrics are, and a WTF imprint it left after the first listen... for some reason, it's not a bad track, as much as it makes little sense, it's catchy.. and about the only song on here that has any boom bass in it, where as most of the other songs on here are classic rock or country sounding, this one combines a bit of rock with a sort of hip hop beat to it. Weirdly, this track grew on me!\n\nRedneck Paradise - Euhhh, seems like Kid has done this song before. I'd rather better red neck songs about drinking or \"Born To Be a Hick\" over this feel good attempt at a trailer park sing-along filler.\n\nCocaine and Gin - Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, I take back that thing I said about rather listening to drinking songs... only when they rock, this one is just a filler for boredom.\n\nMidnight Ferry - I was so sick of hearing halleluiah preachy songs by this point that I just can't even get to the end of this track. Not a good way to close the album. Kid has said he wants this song played at his funeral, I would take \"Only God Knows Why\" over this any day and any night.\n\nI added up my ratings, and can only give this album a 1.9... a bit higher then the last album, but far from the 4 to 5 star ratings for albums Kid has done in the past. Just to be clear, no, I am not a rap or hip hop fan, so with those sounds being absent here have not left me bitter, but I do miss the heavier sound of songs like \"So Hott\", \"American Baddass\" and Kid's earlier album sounds... I do miss The Twisted Brown Trucker Band... plus, what I would have loved to hear was songs like on \"Cocky\" that started off slow, then rocked your @$$ off by the end. Hopefully Kid Rock will return to that sound on the next album. But even so, the songs on here, there are a few decent tracks, but only one or two worthy of being included during live shows, but only barely worthy of being called a hit song... not something I would be disappointed by if they didn't appear on a greatest hits album in future... but compared to Kid's best stuff, really only Mr Rock N Roll would be worthy of standing next to them... but again, not hard to understand if it was passed by as a greatest hits selection.","classification":2,"fold":5}

{"text":"Touted as a return to the band's early, analog-driven improvisations, circa Phaedra and Rubycon, this 2-disc set promises a lot.  Originally known for stretching the capabilities of early synthesizers, the '70s Tangerine Dream, led by keyboardist \/ guitarist Edgar Froese, constructed a trademark sound of free-form washes of audio smears, frantically beeping sequences, symphonic electronics, and subterranean motor rhythms.  Subsequent decades found the band stuffing its catalog with blander, poppier, Yanni baloney.  So does Booster really redeem the band?  Maybe.  Several tracks, such as the Floydish \"The Greek Mirror\" or the 14-minute episodic \"Hyper Sphinx,\" do recall the throbbing oscillations that made Phaedra a theme song, to this day, of WXPN's long-running space-music show Stars' End.  But several tracks trip over their drum machine laces and major-key feet, falling into sun-drenched flowerbeds rather than an orbit around the dark side of Neptune.  Phaedra *****, Rubycon ****, and Ricochet **** remain the untouched trio of Dream classics, supplemented by Froese's first two solo discs, Aqua **** and the rare Epsilon in Malaysian Pale *****.

{"text":"Where to begin?\n\nPerhaps the starting point would be January 1971, when Dolly Parton, then just becoming a big name on her own (apart from Porter Wagoner) and having her first #1 C&W hit with Joshua, met this young, raven-haired Arizona native named Linda Ronstadt when Linda was doing The Johnny Cash Show in Nashville.  Dolly may not have known it then, but she had just met a future collaborator\n\nThen, in March 1973, while on tour as Neil Youngs opening act, in Houston, Linda met up with modern country guru Gram Parsons, who got Linda together with his newfound harmony singer, Birmingham, Alabama native Emmylou Harris.  Linda and Emmy hit it off as friends and vocal partners like gangbusters.\n\nAnd then on September 9, 1975, Dolly, Linda, and Emmylou convened in Los Angeles for an informal gathering of singing of traditional and classic country and folk songs that would spawn a Mutual Admiration Society.  The three women, who would become among the most influential female singers of their generation, became what they first humorously referred to as the Queenston Trio (a play on the Kingston Trio), and then just simply Trio.\n\nBut getting anything officially down in the recording studio and assembling it into an album would be enormously difficult in that period, as all three women had solo careers that were red hot.  Some of the things they recorded would end up on one anothers solo records over the next ten years, and appearances on one anothers albums were inevitable; but it wouldnt be until 1986 that they finally were able to set aside time and get down to business.  And in 1987, they finally came out with their landmark album TRIO, which would help define the female genders role in country, roots-rock, and Americana from that point forward.  In 1999, TRIO II would appear, solidly cementing their reputations as ultimate superstar collaborators.\n\nAnd now in 2016, both of those landmark albums, plus twenty outtakes from those sessions and others, have found their way into THE COMPLETE TRIO COLLECTION, consisting of three CDs.  Both original TRIO records were produced by George Massenburg, whose working relationship with Linda goes back to her landmark 1974 country-rock album HEART LIKE A WHEEL; and the musicians featured on those albums, including David Lindley, Ry Cooder, David Grisman, Steve Fishell, and others, were all roots music veterans that the ladies had known for years.  The third CD has material that had to be left off the first two albums or which was put on their solo albums (My Blue Tears, from Lindas 1982 album GET CLOSER; Where Will The Words Come From?, from Emmylous 1985 album THE BALLAD OF SALLY ROSE), but which can now be seen as further revelations of each womans strengths.  The heretofore unreleased tracks that never saw the light of day until this point include such gems as You Dont Knock, In A Deep Sleep, Are You Tired Of Me?, and Grey Funnel Line, to name just four.  This third CD was assembled together by Emmylou and producer James Austin.\n\nBeyond the extreme significance of this collections release in terms of all things Americana in music and the stature of each of the three ladies over the last 50 years, there are two more overriding reasons why THE COMPLETE TRIO COLLECTION is a collection that needs to be bought and heard so extensively.  First is the continuing dearth of female artists on country radio in light of all the Bro-Country frat boys out there; many women who are doing great work, but aren't getting much if any airplay to show for it, like Tift Merritt, Lindi Ortega, Margo Price, and Caitlin Rose, are musical descendants of Dolly, Linda, and Emmylou.  The second one is much more poignant and tragic, involving the fact that Lindas Parkinsons condition basically destroyed her ability to sing (and in fact is also making it difficult for her to even do the kinds of things we all may take for granted), meaning that this is the Trios valedictory lap.  In any case, this must be considered one of the best music projects of any genre to be released in 2016, featuring three great friends doing what they love doing best just for the sheer hell of it.","classification":5,"fold":5}

Tons of new cd's from popular artsits have flooded the shelves and while some are good most seem to be trading away their Christian themes for more mainstream friendly love\/emotion songs. Not so with Kutless. The rockers from Portland OR have crafted yet another great CD and have added a fine addition to their worship repitoire. This CD is just as good as Strong Tower if not better and the mix of hymns, worship choruses, and Kutless original songs are very well produced and recorded. I was blown away by the title track! It almost seemed to have a David Crowderish electric thing to it but the soaring rock chorus is definitely Kutless. This CD is worth every penney.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Dreams by The Cranberries is a powerful 90s rock song that is both stirring and healing to the soul.  Fighting the Urge to Look Up The Meaning to the Song, Dreams is about coming to terms with multiple changes happening in someones life while appreciating a person who occupies a large place in your heart (metaphorically).  I recently enjoyed hearing Dreams by The Cranberries on iheartradio because it is not played as often on the radio where I currently live  I completely understand that this song could mean something completely different from what Im guessing it is but for me the song reminds me of my husband in a benevolent way.  This is because he has helped me add even more brighter colors (metaphorically speaking) to my life and has helped me appreciate life even more just by his example of how he sees the positive benefits in certain things that would test even the strongest of souls.  Hence, when the lead singer of Cranberries sings you're a dream to me it reminds me of how I have told this to my husband before (just in slightly different words). Overall, Dreams by Cranberry is both an elevating and novelty type of rock song.","classification":5,"fold":5}

First time I listened to this live 2-CD digi-pak - I thought to myself that it's good - but the second time I gave it a spin - I managed to [get even] more out of it - thus the five-star rating that I'm giving it - mostly for content and effort. Gig took place in Tokyo, Japan on June 21, 2013 - I saw Van Halen a year prior to that date. I read somewhere that Eddie Van Halen had decided to release this Tokyo show due to the fact that it was a really good sounding show + plus it was a bit lengthier than other show(s) on that tour because VH had no support band that evening. Clocks in at two hours solid. Liked hearing a handful of tunes off their latest studio effort 'A Different Kind of Truth' like the rocking \"She's The Woman\", the so-so \"Tattoo\" and \"China Town\". Also loved hearing some old vintage Van Halen being brought back to life - like \"Running With The Devil\", the rocking \"I'm The One\", one of my less-played VH gems \"Hear About It Later\", \"And The Cradle Will Rock...\", \"Hot For Teacher\", \"Beautiful Girls\", \"Panama\", the ass-kicking eight-minute \"Eruption\" and \"Ain't Talking About Love\". Recommended.","classification":5,"fold":5}

I liked the country sound to the instrumentation. unfortunately, not the best. not my type of songs to begin with. the songs he has chosen to sing on this album are not that crash hot. Dylan didn't even bother to write any liner notes for this album. some singer\/ songwriters as they mature will run out of problems in their lives, causing them to run out of ideas to write some songs and this is the case with Bob Dylan. his music from his hey day was really sad and happy and those songs had stories behind them. this sounds like Bob Dylan just needs to put away that singing voice and go to sleep. if Dylan had chosen to sing classic country songs by the likes of Don Gibson, Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers, Mearl Haggard to name a few, I will most likely be interested as his voice is still okay for those types of songs and the instrumentation would be great.\nBob if you're reading this, why not put out a covers album of Country Classics the same way you covered these songs. the music isn't all that bad, but just didn't like song choice.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"After Rhino released the near-definitive 2-CD collection THE VERY BEST OF: ONLY THE BEGINNING in 2002, I was a bit confused by the title.  \"Only the Beginning?\" Hey! Chicago hasn't had a top 40 hit since 1991's \"Chasin' the Wind.\" But LOVE SONGS makes it perfectly clear.  That album was only the beginning of repackaging Chicago's material.\n\nThere's really little new here if you already own THE VERY BEST OF.  \"If You Leave Me Now\" is a live version with Philip Bailey. Another live version is \"After the Love Is Gone\" featuring Earth, WInd & Fire.  \"Never Been in Love Before\" is from 1975's CHICAGO VIII.  And \"Here in My Heart\" is a Lenny Kravitz-produced song from 1997's anthology THE HEART OF CHICAGO.\n\nSo what other creative ways can Rhino repackage this material?  The Terry Kath years?  The Robert Lamm-penned songs? Songs from albums whose titles don't contain a Roman numeral?\n\nDon't get me wrong. If all you're looking for is Chicago's love songs--and ONLY their love songs, this is a solid collection.  My only problem with this is that it presents the group as a bit too one dimensional.","classification":3,"fold":5}

I Believe In You, Serve Somebody, When You Gonna Wake Up, and most of the others are quite touching especially with Dylan's delivery.  As a matter Dylans vocal performance is near the best of his career.\n\nSlow Train Comming stands strong as compared to Saved in its diverse musical arrangements.  Some songs are fast paced and others slow.  Some are more keyboard driven and others feature Mark Knophler's fine guitar playing.\n\nOverall this is recording is a true winner.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"It has been a very long time since we have heard anything new from Adam Lambert. While he has had some good songs from For Your Entertainment, he has not been able to definitely follow-up to his success from American Idol after his debut record. It honestly has been a very tough ride overall, but it has been a stepping stone. Still, he has a whole lot to find better for his own work, than trying to be a sound-alike to George Michael. His latest song shows to be more of a haunting rhythm, but not anything outrageous. Ghost Town, the lead single from his third album The Original High, is not anything that really ignites afire from the heart. The song doesn't actually ignite they way that he did with What Do You Want From Me from his past. I really do think Adam needs to have a sound that is more driven from the soul after Idol, and he not been able to have something more strong that made it more like a haunting.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":5}

For Bruno Mars, whom has really hit a groove on his own and with B.O.B., has had a few hits that've really made it to call his own, and a few nice songs too. His latest from his debut album Doo Wops & Hooligans, The Lazy Song isn;t bad at all. It really is a nice laid back diddy. While it isn't as good of a feel-good songa s was with Jason Mraz's I'm Yours a couple of years ago, but it still is very nice to listen to. I found The Lazy Song to be not so lazy at all, but I thought the video was cute with him jamming and dancing with dancers wearing monkey masks, in fine harmony with each other. That was adorable. I hope Bruno can come out with some more nice songs like this one. He has been a grab with the mainstream that hasn't felt like he is lazy.\n\nSong: B 1\/2-","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Depeche Mode-founder Martin Gore has issued some previous solo stuff (including Counterfeit; Counterfeit2) and then some 2-3 years ago came an enticing collaborative effort between Gore and the other DM-founder Vince Clark, who departed DM after just one album. That collaboration album, called \"vcmg\" was well received by critics and DM-enthusiasts alike. Now comes the next chapter in Gore's musical outlet outside of Depeche Mode.\n\n\"mg\" (16 tracks; 55 min.) at first blush sounds like it could be a sequel of sorts to the \"vcmg\" album, in particular the opening track \"Pinking\" gives the impression that this could tilt over into a danceable and\/or big track. But very quickly it becomes apparent that \"mg\" is in fact quite the departure, if not the opposite, from \"vcmg\". Rather than providing dance beats, big bass, and extraverted sounds that were the trademarks of \"vcmg\", this album instead mostly goes a lot more abstract, and introverted. \"Hum\" even sounds Eno-like ambient. There are a couple of exceptions, check \"Brink\" and the even harder charging \"Crowley\". Also, the individual tracks tend to be quite a bit shorter that anything on \"vdmg\", giving you the impression that you are listening to a musical score or soundtrack from an imaginary movie (\"Europa Hymn\" seems like it's ready-made for use on the big screen). Not that there is anything wrong with any of this! At this point in his career, Gore is doing whatever pleases him, and more power to him.\n\nBottom line: if you feel like listening to an instrumental electronic \"mood\" album, you could do a lot worse that this. I admit that at 55 min., this is a LONG album and towards the end it starts to drag a bit but I suppose that that is what the \"skip\" button is for. If you are a DM fan, you may or may not like this. But I'd certainly encourage you to at least check it out. You may be pleasantly surprised by what you find. \"mg\" is a welcome addition to the Martin Gore catalog!","classification":4,"fold":5}

With her perfromance recently on Good Morning America, and her recent documentary on MTV Britney: For The Record, she has shown that she has been more unhappy not having control over her life, than her career coming to full force. That is shown on her latest single Circus, the second songle and title track from her latest album. She doesn't feel like she has captured a new essence to that next level. The song feels like it rehashed from the beats from her earlier material like I'm A Slave For U. I really felt like she has run out of songs, and her feeling is that she just doesn't want to sing anymore.

{"text":"In the mid-sixties A&M was a soft pop label known for easy listening \/ adult contemporary sounds. The vocal harmonies of We Five fit right in. To enjoy this album you're really going to have to like their harmonies as applied to the standard operating procedure of MOR albums of the day: an album would have a single or two (or none) padded with covers of standards or show tunes or other popular hits of the day.\n\nOf the twelve songs, one is the hit single title track, three are penned by John Stewart of the Kingston Trio (soon to have a #1 song with the Monkees singing his \"Daydream Believer\"), and the rest are a random assortment of show tunes. I picked up this album as well as the second,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Make-Someone-Happy\/dp\/B00386OKYU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Make Someone Happy<\/a>, from the used bins a few years ago. We Five's sound is pleasing to the ear but the MOR playlist lends a generic touch to their legacy; this playlist could have come from the Sandpipers but We Five turned up for the recording session instead.\n\nUnless you're seriously jonesing to relive memories of this album echoing through the hallways of the college dorm, you're probably better off downloading the one hit, sampling the others and seeing which might round out your We Five selections.

Back to the album, the kid definitely has some potential but this is a little to radio-friendly for me.  Of the 7 songs, 4 are good (1 real good), 3 are ok, but no classics.  Guests are on 3 of the 7 (all have Lil Wayne which brings the album down in my opinion as I can't stand him).  Production is decent.

{"text":"When it has came down to the past 25 years, Madonna has simply been the most influential dance diva of all-time. Her success has been absolutely out of the ordinary. But, unfortunately her music hasn't really hit the home run in her recent records, and with more of her life the past few years on her marriage to Guy Richie ending, and her adopting African babies, she hasn't been able to really deliver to the big hits. That simple is also the case with Celebration, the new single from Madonna's upcoming anthology from her success with the Warner Brothers era. The song sadly doesn't really deliver the same spark Madonna had delivered throughout her past 26 years. The song sadly is not Madonna at her best. It feels like she doesn't hit that nail on the head, as we've heard from her last few records. While she has been known as the material girl, her material needs to be more fine-tuned when she does deliver her next studio album.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":5}
{"text":"Album: 4 stars; Live set: 5 stars\n\nI recently saw Big Grams in concert (more on that later). Let me state upfront that I've been a fan of Phantogram since the early hour, and when I heard that they were doing a collaboration album with Outcast's Big Boi, I couldn't help but be surprised a bit. But with 20\/20 hindsight, it all made sense of course. It's hard to believe that this (mini-)album came out last September, it seems like it was yesterday...\n\n\"Bog Grams\" (7 tracks; 27 min.) opens with \"Run For Your Life\", and it's probably my least favorite track on here. Not enough melodic hooks for my liking. That gets corrected right away with \"Lights On\", in which Phantogram's Sarah Barthel sings lead and which really sounds like a Phantogram track for the most part. \"Fell In the Sun\" feels like the first TRUE collaboration as Big Boi and Berthel trade verse and chorus. \"Put It On Her\" is an up-tempo track in which all three (Big Boi, Josh Carter and Barthel) trade verses, and the lyrics of which will make you likely blush. \"Goldmine Junkie\" is the only non-dance oriented track on here. The release concludes with \"Drum Machine\", another highlight. In all, this is a nice release (not sure one can really call it an \"album\", at just 27 min.--couldn't they really not come up with even just one more song?).\n\nLast weekend I had the good fortune of catching Big Grams in concert at the rapidly growing Bunbury Music Festival here in Cincinnati. Due to a thunderstorm passing through, their 7 pm set start was delayed half an hour, and just as they finally hit the stage, the sun came back out. \"Thank you for bringing the sun back just for us!\" Sarah screamed, to the delight of the massive crowd. Big Grams live plays as a four-some, but let's be real, all the attention goes to Sarah and Big Boi. They put on a boisterous set, played mostly from the album but also a couple of covers, including Outcast's \"Ms. Jackson\", again to the crowd's delight. Big Grams' set was the best of the entire festival for me, period. Just fun from start to finish. If you have a chance to see them in concert, do not miss them!","classification":4,"fold":5}

This time around, the list gets longer  Cadillac, Cadillac, Bulletproof Picasso, and the all-too-real Angel in Blue Jeans.  Singer Pat Monahan still hits the highs, but with a welcome rasp of age.  The band is now tight as a Mason jar, dropping dynamic shifts like a San-Fran Steely Dan, albeit with slightly lighter moods, internal rhyme, and many stadium-sized choruses.  Is it formulaic?

{"text":"Buffett goes back to writing all of the songs on this album except one, and for the most part it works well.  After dabbling with country on the \"Riddles In The Sand\" album, Buffett moves back away from it with the exception of two tracks on \"Mango\".  \"Please Bypass This Heart\" is nothing spectacular, but the other country oriented tune on the album turns out to be one of it's best with \"If The Phone Doesn't Ring, It's Me\".  I believe it has been covered by several country artists over the years and is a really great song (this is coming from a guy who does not like country music).  Other highlights on the album include \"Frank And Lola\" a hilarious character study of a middle age couple trying to re-kindle a spark in their relationship on vacation in Florida.  \"Desperation Samba\" is another great Buffett \"south of the border\" tune.  The title track \"Last Mango In Paris\" is classic Buffett.  The album closer \"Beyond The End\" is a song a lot of Buffett fans don't seem to care for, but I think it makes a nice grandiose close to the disc.  The album also includes several of Buffett's popular concert favorites \"Jolly Mon\" and \"Gypsies In The Palace\".  Some of the production on this album is very 80's oriented which dates it a bit, but overall this is another good album from Jimmy.","classification":4,"fold":5}

It's this one.\n\nIt's this one in that Jerry is on and the rest of the band are right there with him. This music is what happens when the Grateful Dead really listened to one another and the interactions both dynamic and structural are wonderful.

{"text":"This set of (mostly) excerpts from Mozart compositions features quality recordings of good performances, and is a good choice for anyone who wants an in-depth introduction to Mozart, or just a nice playlist of mostly popular Mozart works. On the downside, it is a collection of excerpts, rather than full works. But of course many people are fine with that, and may actually prefer a \"best of\"-type collection.\n\nAn obvious question for many will be how this collection from LA-based Cobra Entertainment compares to the earlier set&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-99-Most-Essential-Mozart-Masterpieces\/dp\/B001NJUGV0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The 99 Most Essential Mozart Masterpieces<\/a>&nbsp;from Sweden's X5 Music Group. According to my calculations, 33 of the 99 tracks have the same music, although in different performances. These are almost all typical \"greatest hits\" that anyone would recognize.\n\nThe other 66 tracks are different selections than those X5 made, and are not all will be instantly recognizable to everyone -- but still all great Mozart. I think it's safe to say there are more opera tracks here, including nine selections from \"The Marriage of Figaro\" and 10 from \"The Magic Flute\" (although surprisingly, these do not include the two of the most famous\/popular selections -- the aria of the Queen of the Night or \"Papageno, Papagena\").\n\nI am on the record in a lot of reviews as somewhat critical when sets like these, focused on a single composer, present only excerpts from larger works. This is why the set rates four stars in my book, but if you prefer this kind of selection, it could be easily five stars for you.\n\nA note for those concerned about repetition. There were four Mozart tracks on the recent bargain collection&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/99-Must-Have-Chillout-Classics\/dp\/B0051QU0M6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">99 Must-Have Chillout Classics<\/a>, and all of these are repeated in this set. Some repetition is normal -- content providers by their nature live on repackaging content to some extent. Four tracks isn't much, but caution may be warranted in the future as Cobra Entertainment's catalog grows.\n\nI haven't listened to every track, but have listened to many and sampled most by now. The performances are good and the technical quality is very good for MP3 -- variable bit rates averaging 201 to 246 kbps with quality underlying recordings. Total download size is 936 MB.\n\nThis set is a great bargain, especially at the introductory price of two dollars. It is also nice listening in the car. And finally, with the recent birth of our son, I am always on the lookout for good music in the nursery, and I think most of this will be excellent. I think the short selections here may actually more appropriate than full-length works for the short attention span of an infant.\n\nRecommended for anyone, except for those with great Mozart collections already.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"I had never heard this song before.  It is refreshing to hear a completely new Christmas song.  Two vocalists trade off on this piece (female and male), accompanied by guitar, drum, strings orchestration, and clarinet here and there (I believe).  There's also an blues-style electric organ in the background.\n\nThe rhythm is good and pretty evenly paced throughout.  Interesting mix of classical strings, acoustic guitar, blues electric organ and a jazzy clarinet. Each providing a light touch of different genres. Who would have thought of putting this all together and that it would blend well. I like the voices, the male voice is baritone and has a slightly rough edge that is an interesting contrast to his female counterpart (and doesn't sound like all the other male voices I've heard). This could easily have been a non-Christmas piece.\n\nIf you like country, or blues and\/or light rock, I think you would enjoy this a lot.","classification":5,"fold":5}

Raul Malo the most unique singer out there, with a crystal clear voice that cuts thru the night. They also did a number of songs from their forthcoming Feb. 2015 Cd titled MONO.

Their latest song Rebel Beat form their 2013 record Magnetic, actually is a upbeat and driven song. It definitely is catchy and strong with what John Reznik and the guys have badly needed, after having some lackluster songs for the past several years. It definitely is much better than the joke songs that many of today's artists have shown. I hope there are ore good songs like this from the guys from Buffalo, New York soon.

{"text":"Word of mouth and buzz helped make \"Menopause\" a sleeper stage hit with middle-aged women.  This CD is mainly sold at the theatres that book the show on the nights they're on in the lobby.  This is the original cast (the usual case for this kind of release), so the end result can be different than of the actresses on the leg that perform in your area.  Don't expect a bunch of female Weird Als or \"Capitol Steps\"\/\"SNL\"\/\"Mad TV\" types.  The instrumentation is slightly amateurish, low budget, watered down, and weak.  For \"My Husband Sleeps Tonight\", a parody of the cringey oldie \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\", no credit is given to Solomon Linda, whose family fought for his recognition and residuals.  Some parodies keep the same titles as the songs they lampoon, like Tina Turner's comeback \"What's Love Got to Do with It?\".  That almost defeats the purpose.\nMost men and younger women may not relate to the lyrics that Jeanie Linders wrote from experience.  They refer to symptoms like hot flashes, ageing, night sweats, cramps, insomnia, mood swings, restlessness, binge eating, weight gain, wobbly temper, becoming like their mothers; you name it!  Then again, maybe some things we all might get!  Because of the adult nature of these songs, I wouldn't play them around small children.\nFor the UK edition, Iowa Housewife becomes Rutland Housewife (Rutland could refer to Eric Idle's \"Rutland Weekend Television\", which makes some sense here), and the ladies meet at Mohamed Al-Fayed's world famous department store Harrod's instead of New York City's Bloomingdale's, and there are other regional variations around the world in contrast to the America-centric flagship.  Hopefully, they'll all release their own editions.\nThere have been two annual sold-out residencies to date in my town (and maybe yours as well), and it's always a rave.  Going to the show can't always be immortalised onto a studio recording.","classification":3,"fold":5}

The songs you know are new again sung by Sufjian, and the new tunes fit in really well with the old.  The fact that there are 50+ tracks in this set is unreal, and an absolute delight.  I cannot recommend this Christmas set highly enough for anyone who loves Sufjian or Indie pop.

{"text":"It was a relatively short but highly successful run. Between 1965 and 1970 a five man group from Los Angeles known as The Turtles produced some of the biggest and brightest pop records of the decade. The Turtles came out of nowhere in the summer of '65 with their debut single \"It Ain't Me Babe\".  The song was written by Bob Dylan who seemed to be all the rage that year and it climbed all the way to #8 on the national charts. Most folks just presumed that The Turtles were a folk group and were a bit surprised that a number of the groups subsequent releases were pure pop. The group continued to release singles such as \"You Baby\" and \"Can I Get To Know You Better\" with varying degrees of success until early 1967 when they finally struck pay dirt with a tune called \"Happy Together\".  This would prove to be their biggest and best remembered record. But as far as I'm concerned the Turtles finest single was the follow-up to \"Happy Together\".  The upbeat, bouncy \"She'd Rather Be With Me\" peaked at number 3 nationally during the Summer of Love. The song was also a huge hit in Ireland, Denmark, Canada, South Africa and the United Kingdom. This is the original White Whale recording you would remember from the radio.","classification":5,"fold":5}

Many people are against the wars, but you can be against wars, but still support the troops.  They volunteered to go over to those countries where they don't know the language, fear for their lives every day.  I had one grandson who went over and served 3 times, he is home now for good; his health suffered a lot during those war zone actions.  He has had two operation on his head and might have to have his the glan that determine how long you keep growing is going to be taken out. My Baby sisters only child who is over in that last place every returning soldiers are coming from he won't be home until December of this year. She is near fifty, and her husband has parkinson disease. IF her son dies over their I am feared that she will give up on life, she saw her father died of type 1 diabetes, she has type two diabeties but so do I.  My son is 46, my daughter is 51 a few days ago. Think of the families whose loved one come home is a flag draped coffin, feel their lose.  Toby Keith is a man who know the cost of keeping our homeland free. He supports our soldiers, DO YOU??????","classification":5,"fold":5}
{"text":"This Music On Vinyl 180-gram reissue of this iconic MTH album was pressed on perfectly flat, dead-quiet vinyl - there were no issues of any kind; no surface noise, \"ticks\/pops\" etc, at all on my copy. The LP was pressed \"in the EU\" ...which doesn't tell us much, but the quality of the vinyl here was very good.  I burned through several copies of the original US Columbia release back in the day, and this reissue sounds faithful and true to those LP's - and if this is from 2nd-generation masters, or worse, from digital, I can't tell (and apparently MOV won't tell - and if anyone out there knows, please leave a comment)... there does not seem be be any effort at tweaking the original sound.

{"text":"Over two years after Robin Gibb passed away, his last solo album is released with some songs nearly ten years old.  These were written between the years of 2004-2008 with the hope of using some as part of a Bee Gees reunion with Barry.  That was not to be.\n\nThe listener does get treated to an array of some of Robin Gibb's best music to date.  It's much more upbeat in style and verse than previous Gibb compositions and the result is wonderful.  Relying mostly on electronic equipment, it's tough to tell that most of the instruments are electronic.  Robin's voice is more reedy than usual with a higher pitch, but that only tends to pulls the listener in closer.  This is Robin Gibb at his most vulnerable and intimate self.\n\nWith a hefty dose of seventeen songs, Robin Gibb concentrates on layered songs backed with a strong beats.  In fact, only two songs, 'Solid' and 'All We Have Is Now' are the only slower ballads and they stand up to any previous Gibb tearjerker.  One of the standout cuts that are worthy of single treatment are 'Alan Freeman Days' with its excitable exclamatory proclamations.  'I Am The World' is a remix of the 1966 B-Side vocal and it's a layered composition that stands up to modern tastes and styles.  'Broken Wings' contains a danceable beat that begs for an extended version, if not a single release.  The instrumental sections and backing vocals are synthesized genius.  'Avalanche', a title taken from a 1970 song is an anthemic upbeat journey of a song with powerful backing vocals.\n\n'Mother Of Love' is presented in its original form and is a nice respite from the bevy of strong songs, but what it lacks in structure, it makes up in pure emotion.  'Don't Cry Alone' is a wonderful reminder of Robin and RJ Gibb's classical hybrid, Titanic Requiem'.  The closing cut, 'Sydney' is one of the saddest songs I think I've heard any Gibb brother sing.  Reportedly recorded on an iPad with sparse working, the lyrics and the yearning vocal tug at your heart when you realize what Robin is singing about - a loss of innocence and younger times.  It's the perfect finish for this album.\n\nWith a nice cardboard sleeve and notes from his wife Dwina, this makes for a fan special.  Note that the Isle Of Man Post Office is releasing a limited edition of this album (1,000 copies) with an accompanying DVD.  Robin Gibb deserves this and more.  Thank you Robin.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"It was in 2001, when the punk group Sum-41 finally hit it big with the release of their breakthrough album: ALL KILLER NO FILLER. The band received radio and televised airplay like crazy. Sum-41 also landed soundtrack spots for copilation CD's, the film Spider-man, and the television show Malcom In The Middle. It was clear that the public had finally come around to listening to the punk group's music. The public had good reason. Sum-41 has a great sense of when and how much distortion to use in their very interesting and fast paced rhythm changes. The guitars have a great taste in creating simple but very unique melodies. The bass gives the extra fill in creating the band's harmonies, and the drums keep everything together. The lyrics to ALL KILLER NO FILLER are amusing and can even be considered to be slightly contraversial for the track \"Fat Lip\". The lyricist makes honest and \"in your ears\" remarks about society and its expectations of its citizens. ALL KILLER NO FILLER is a fun piece of work, and one I highly recomend hearing in its entirity.\n\nStand out tracks include:\n\"Fat Lip\"\n\"Rhythms\"\n\"Motivation\"\n\"In Too Deep\"","classification":4,"fold":5}

No matter, though, because being a universal language, music belongs to the world. There is so much going on in this arrangement, and it all fits together so perfectly, that you have to listen to it over and over to begin to pick up everything that's going, from the harmonies and little vocal touches and phrasings, to that incredible female background soprano, which I sounds almost like a Theramin, one of the first electronic instruments.

I'd appreciate it.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind when you think of \"Nevermind\" is probably the overrated \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" but there have been other tracks from it that made the radio, like \"In Bloom.\"\n\nThe mellow points on this album are \"Polly\" and \"Something In The Way,\" which has a proceeding dynamic-contradictory hidden track after it that makes you wait a ridiculous near 10 minutes to get to.\n\nI don't think the big hit is the hardest track on this album, and of course I don't think it was the best since it was too mainstream; none of the radio hits are my favorites either, although they were decent. \"Territorial Pissings\" is my favorite; very rough with vocals and production. Other highlights are:\n+@\"Breed\"\n+@ \"Drain You,\" which has the incredible line, \"With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil, you taught me everything...\"\n+@\"Lounge Act\"\n+@\"Stay Way\" with its agreed upon lyric, \"...I'd rather be dead than cool\"\n+@\"Lithium,\" with its indignant lyric and its fluctuation of dynamics\n+@\"Come As You Are,\" which has the only lyrics in the short booklet\n\nI'm quite a sensitive lyrical person, for those who don't know by now. The worse track on this album would be \"On A Plain\" because of a weird lyric about a mother dying every night.\n\nOne thing I like about this album for sure is the drum work and the guitar utilization.\nGreat album!","classification":5,"fold":5}
{"text":"Selah started their career with discs that were almost all hymns.  The last few releases, they seemed to get away from that, releasing songs that were still worshipful but original.  With You Amaze Us, they are back and with a good mix of the two that will thrill their fans.\n\nThe disc starts out with the new songs.  In fact, it starts right out with the title track, You Amaze Us.  The verses are about the times in life that we see God work while the verse is a soaring call to praise God because He is worthy.  It might be a bit simple, but it is wonderful, and the catchy melody and mid-tempo music is likely to get stuck in your head.\n\nIf that song hasn't already lifted your spirit in praise, the next one will for sure.  Oh Our Lord is actually even more likely to get stuck in your head and is just as fun to listen to as the first track.  The chorus comes directly from Psalm 8 and is just a simple declaration that our God is worth of praise.  The verses marvel in how God displays His majesty in nature on a daily basis.\n\nWhen I was reading the track listing, I assumed that the third track was the hymn At the Cross.  While it does borrow a few lines from the hymn on the bridge, its actually a brand new song that marvels at the contradictions of the cross.  As the second verse puts it, Dark and sacred hill\/Where violence purchased peace\/The innocent was bound\/To set the captive free.  This is a bit slower with Allans piano forming more of a basis of the song than in the first two tracks.  The lyrics are just wonderful, and I can see this being added to worship services across the country.\n\nI was actually surprised at some of the hymns they recorded on this disc.  Its hard to believe they hadnt done Just As I Am or The Old Rugged Cross Yet.  They continue their tradition of putting together wonderful renditions of these classic hymns.  They are still familiar enough that you can sing along the first time through, but they are also different enough to keep you coming back for more listens.  Theyve added a new chorus to Just As I Am that really captures the spirit of the familiar verses.  While that song includes guitar and drums, they go much simpler on Id Rather Have Jesus, which just has piano and cello, and The Old Rugged Cross, which just has piano.  Not that The Old Rugged Cross is a traditional take at all.  Its got a jazzy feel to it that is tons of fun.  Its nothing compared to Victory in Jesus which they really spice up and leave with a cool, funky, bluesy sound (Amys words from the booklet).  It is a blast to listen to, and I was nodding along the first time I heard it.\n\nOne tradition the group keeps up in having at least one song that includes lyrics in Kituba, the native language where Todd grew up as a missionary kid in Africa.  This time, that song is Soon and Very Soon, and I knew theyd switch to Kituba as soon as I heard the opening notes.  They give it a very tribal feel, so the switch from English in the first verse is very natural.\n\nAbout the only song I don't like is Nearing Home.  Allan actually recorded it on his recent solo disc, and I didn't care for it there, either.  Its a tribute to Billy Graham, and it bothers me for that reason.  I was also bothered when Newsong did something similar two decades ago, so at least Im consistent, right?  But its easy enough to skip it.\n\nThe disc ends with an interesting song.  We Must Not is actually a song written from the point of view of someone in the parts of the church that are being persecuted today to us in the American church.  Its actually a great plea for prayer and to remember that we are brothers and sisters in Christ as we strive to reach the world with the gospel.  Even more convicting is the part that asks not for safety for them but boldness and for the souls of their persecutors to be saved.  So often, songs that try to tackle a subject like this feel more like a guilt trip, but this one challenges without the guilt, and I really like it.\n\nIm so glad I started listening to Selahs music a couple of years ago.  You Amaze Us is another amazing disc filled with songs that will help you worship God.  What more could we want?","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I still like this debut that Keith Washington did in 1991.  Very smooth R&B songs that recall the era when male singers sang their songs with class.  Nettlesby and Coffey and some other producers provided Washington with such gorgeous, classy songs.  Kissing You is reminiscent of the Nat King Cole era of the '50s a little bit when you hear it.  It's like he did it with an orchestra.  I still like All Night, Ready, Willing and Able and When You Say You Love Me (is that the right title?).  Much of the album stays on the mid tempo to ballad vibe, no trendy Usher or Bobby Brown-like flashy songs or a guest rapper's appearance like what works and sounds good to some artists now. This is the album Luther Vandross should have made, but Keith beat him to it in the same year when they both had competing albums!

{"text":"It seems like the record companies who track what gets released to radio have the stupidest brains when it comes to choosing singles.\n\nI know Brantley Gilbert penned this song because of the tragic death of a soldier, and that makes a song worth serious attention, but there are tons of other country songs out there regarding fallen soldiers or soldiers in general out there and much more emotional and heart-felt than this song. I don't mind Brantley Gilbert making a song about the undeserved death of a soldier, since most of his material released as singles is either mediocre or absolutely horrible (I give 'Bottoms Up' credit for at least being catchy even though there are things about it that I don't like), but trying to express the emotion of th death of a loved one in a song, and then using the most trite, horrid, and annoying high-pitched guitar solos all over the song make the person the song is about ashamed. In fact, this is worse than what Gilbert has put out with any of his other singles. At least songs like 'Read Me My Rights' & 'Stone Cold Sober' show that Gilbert is making music correctly even though the instrumental elements of the songs may not be done well.\n\nBut, when Radio Stations fumble with what gets played on the radio, and then choose a very annoying and terrible song to play, thats what should be abolished for eternity.  Even worse is when they play a bad song ad nauseum, you predict they probably won't play a song that much to elavate your anger, but they do anyway, no matter how you feel about the song, and it never stops until you start hating the song with a passion, and THEN they start to cool down with that song. Instead of just stopping with the song right when you feel like they need to stop. That is a method in radio, not just country, that needs to be abolished from reality for eternity.\n\nWe need a Brantley Gilbert song that isn't so boring, bland, trite, or not what you want to repeat on Spotify. His new single isn't helping because besides the country pop and rock stuff that you saw in 'Bottoms Up', Gilbert ends up using some of the worst cliches and overused phrases. Instead of thinking to yourself 'Finally, a song from this guy I can actually tolerate beyond chart movement', its always the same feelings about a whole new song all over again.\n\nSo overall, listen to Toby Keiths 'Ameican Soldier' instead of this stupid Def Leppard, Guns N Roses country garbage with lyrics.","classification":1,"fold":5}

While he isn't as visually exciting or physically demanding as many of his piers, his shows have an intimacy that few performers are able to capture.\n\nThe two disc 1993 release offers an excellent sampling of Taylor's tour from that year. The song selections could not be more perfect, offering his biggest hit singles (\"Fire and Rain,\" \"You've Got a Friend,\" \"How Sweet It Is,\" \"Handy Man\"), beloved fan favorites (\"Sweet Baby James,\" \"Something in the Way She Moves,\" \"Carolina in My Mind,\" \"Country Road\"), obscure album cuts (\"Traffic Jam,\" \"Secret O' Life,\" \"Millworker,\" \"That Lonesome Road\"), and several cuts from his most recent efforts.

It's delight to the ears and a great change of pace from the music ruling the airwaves these days. I enjoy the entire album, but my top 3 for now are as follows:\n\n~*~\"What Kind of Fool\" - The piano arrangement is gorgeous! As a John Legend fan, I heard about this duet which brought me to the album and what a gift it has been. This song is beautifully produced and John and Barbra complement one another very well.\n\n~*~\"It Had To Be You\" - Playful and lovely. A great introduction for the album. I wouldn't mind if Barbra and Michael Buble did an entire album together.\n\n~*~\"How Deep Is The Ocean\" - I've never heard of Jason Gould but, wow, what a voice. Their voices soar wonderfully together here!\n\n'Partners' is as mellow and as refreshing as an autumn breeze and is highly recommended for fans of easy listening music.","classification":5,"fold":5}

It is definitely a good connection with her past works nicely like Tightrope with Big Boi from Outkast and Q.U.E.E.N. with Erykah Badu.

{"text":"This tribute CD is a cut above the many generic sounding tribute CDs out these days. The music and vocals are faithful to the REAL SILKY SOUL sound that Maze is known for. For me, the money track is by Ledisi. Her rendering of \"Happy Feelings\" is just not good but, damn good. Midway through the song, Ledisi sounds as if she's channeling Stephanie Mills' memorable style of vocal delivery.\nA prime assembly of talent was brought together for this project. Musiq Souchild, Mary J Blige, Avant, Kem and others really bring it! Frank Beverly's son produced what is a great soulful homage to his dad. The only thing better is the original songs as Frank & his posse recorded and continually perform live.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"The Pennsylvania band Breaking Benjamin has gone though numerous lineup changes since their debut, but that hasn't altered their sound or the vision on frontman Benajmin Burnley. He founded the band in the late 90's with drummer Jeremy Hummel as they recruited bassist Mark Klepaski and guitarist Aaron Fink. As the original lineup, they released two albums - 2002's \"Saturate\" and their 2004 breakthrough effort \"We Are Not Alone\". The album was such as success, it spawned three hit singles: \"So Cold\", \"Sooner Or Later\" and \"Forget It\", which was notable for being one of the relatively few outside writing contributions from Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan. Chad Szeliga replaced Hummel for their next two recordings: \"Phobia\" and \"Dear Agony\". As the band's popularity grew, they were struck with inner turmoil. Band members Aaron Fink and Mark Klepaski sought to compile a greatest hits album on Burnley's behalf without notifying him - as he was in the hospital dealing with a serious illness. This action resulted in the two being fired and drummer Chad Szeliga leaving shortly thereafter. After the recuperation, Burnley was the lone member of Breaking Benjamin. Around 2014, he made the decision to form the band with an all new lineup.\n\nBurnley recruited two guitarists - Jasen Rauch and Keith Wallen (former members of Red and Adelita's Way, respectively), bassist Aaron Bruch and former Picture Me Broken drummer Shaun Foist. Aside from bringing the band from a four piece to a quintet, another thing that changed for Breaking Benjamin is Wallen and Bruch handling background vocals - a job that was previously done by Burnley himself. Although he has been the band's primary singer and songwriter, \"Dark Before Dawn\" is the first Breaking Benjamin album where he has a production credit. The album contains ten songs which are bookended by two interludes composed by Rauch. Although the band went through an overhaul in personnel changes, very little has changed for them sonically. The album starts off with the first single \"Failure\", which - like several songs on the album - deal with Burnley trying to make sense of his illness. He struggles with his emotions on the ballad \"Hollow\", while staying true to his commitment on \"Close To Heaven\". Jasen Rauch and Keith Wallen help out with the songwriting on \"Never Again\", as they keep faith in someone on \"The Great Divide\". Although most of the album has a heavy sound, Breaking Benjamin throws a curveball with the acoustic ballad \"Ashes Of Eden\", in which the band is aided by a string section. \"Dark Before Dawn\" is a great album from Breaking Benjamin. Despite the controversy that surrounded the band, they still manage to soldier on and create yet another solid album in their catalog.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"This lovely Little Big Box showcases the sweet tooth of the Bach Guild. Wrapped in a commercial drive to present repertoire not fully represented in the catalog (at that time), Seymour Solomon couldn't resist the charm of the Mozart divertimento. Throughout the history of the label there were always recordings of Mozart divertimenti presented. The Vienna era is represented with recordings by Mogens Woldike and the Vienna State Opera Orchestra, I Solisti di Zagreb added two albums of divertimenti, the American conductor David Blum recorded with the Esterhazy Orchestra and the English Chamber Orchestra, and one of the first releases on the Omega label in the 1990s was a performance of the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra performing the light classics of Mozart.\n\nAs with our recent Little Big Box of Telemann, the devotion to Mozart divertimenti was wide but shallow. Theres repetition that is not presented here  the K. 136, 138 and 139 divertimenti were recorded three times by The Bach Guild, leaving several of the more interesting divertimenti to be left aside. However, we are treated to some fine performances that show that these are not the toss-off works that one might think.\n\nWhile not representing the highest level of Mozarts musical genius, these fine works do show off a charm that is hard to turn away from  and so Bach Guild did not. Always crowd pleasing and ultimately very worthwhile, the ensembles present very fine and detailed performances. Each recording shows the strengths of the ensemble, and occasionally the weaknesses as well. The larger groups can have some trouble navigating the twists and turns and just plod on through, and the smaller ensembles can miss some moments of power, and tweet their way through.\n\nWhat you get in this set is a marvelous mix of superb ensembles flying their way through some musical cotton candy, and showing us that even in cotton candy is some element of understanding of the human need  you cant live on it, but it fits the bill when the time is right.\n\nAs for performances, the newest arrivals here are the digital debut of Leopold Stokowskis performance of the Gran Partita, recorded in the early 1960s with musicians of his own choosing in New York and Washington, DC. Also making their digital debut are the fine performances of the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra, with Iona Brown conducting. These performances were released on CD in the early 1990s and have been out of print since the early 2000s.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Herman's Hermits were nearly as successful as The Beatles and The Stones in the sixties and also made the American breakthrough. They had a knack for hummable, melodic tunes and they featured in a movie or two that I saw as a kid (Ms Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter was one of those movie hits, the daughter in question being the puppy of a racing dog if I remember correctly!). What set them apart, was the lovely harmony vocals and the British accent; unlike most, they never affected an American or even mid-Atlantic accent in their catchy music. This excellent collection includes all of their greatest hits, taking the listener down memory lane to revisit the innocence of the 60s with glorious pop songs like I'm Into Something Good, Sleepy Joe and humorous ditties like I'm Hennery The Eighth I Am. My personal favourites include No Milk Today, There's A Kind Of Hush, My Sentimental Friend, Years May Come, Years May Go and Lady Barbara. I suppose they were considered a teenybop band and therefore weren't taken as seriously as some of their contemporaries, but time has been kind to their music - compared to a lot of today's chart stuff, this is a classic, timeless sound. This album will appeal to everyone who loves clever, tuneful pop performed with feeling and intelligence.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"When the quartet Slaughterhouse formed in 2008, almost all of them had a little over a decade of recording experience. Joell Ortiz got his start as a guest and co-producer on songs from Kool G. Rap's 2002 album \"The Giancana Story\". Joe Budden had a huge hit with the Just Blaze produced single \"Pump It Up\" and Crooked I was a recording artist on Death Row Records who recorded songs for a few soundtracks. Lastly, Royce Da 5'9\" was an Eminem associate who went his own way and released a few albums independently. By the time the end of the decade came, all of the formerly solo artists came together as a supergroup for one song on Budden's album \"Halfway House\". The song was well received and they moved forward with plans to record an album as a group. In 2009, they released their critically acclaimed self titled debut on E1 Music, which yielded the singles \"Microphone\" and \"The One\". In 2011, Royce and Eminem patched up their differences and recorded the long awaited collaboration album as Bad Meets Evil. That same year, Eminem signed Slaughterhouse to his Interscope distributed Shady Records and the end result is their sophomore album \"Welcome To: Our House\".\n\nWhile their debut was deeply rooted in the underground scene, their new album is clearly aimed at a wider audience. A lot of that has to do with their CEO\/executive producer Eminem whose heavy handed ways are prevalent throughout this recording. The album opens up with the Skylar Grey featured \"Our House\", in which they cite other hip hop artists that have influenced them. Busta Rhymes guests on the chorus on the Hit-Boy produced \"Coffin\", while they sample Korn's \"Falling Away From Me\" on the first single \"Hammer Dance\". Producer No I.D. (Jay-Z, Kanye West, Common) turns in the frantic sounding \"Get Up\", while Cee-Lo Green guests on \"My Life\". On \"Flip A Bird\", they turn a sample of Imogen Heap's \"Little Bird\" into a song about leaving the music industry to become a drug runner. They reunite with Mr. Porter on the Swizz Beatz assisted club anthem \"Throw It Away\" as well as on the song \"Die\". For the most part, Slaughterhouse's \"Welcome To: Our House\" is a decent record that could have been a lot better. While they are at the top of their game lyrically, the production is a tad bothersome and doesn't quite work with their sound. In short, if one is looking for something similar to their debut, \"Welcome To: Our House\" is the farthest thing from it.","classification":3,"fold":5}

To know that wherever you are, whatever you are going through all you have to do is Cry Out To Jesus.  Such truth and honesty is rare in the world of music these days.  I give so much credit to the men of Third Day for putting out honest, honorable songs with incredible lyrics that can touch everyone listening to them.  These guys are amazing songwriters.  This song gives you a reason to keep holding on.  In your darkest hour, all you have to do is Cry Out To Jesus.  He's always there listening and ready to deliver you from whatever it is that is burdening you.  Praise God.  And thank God for inspiring Third Day to be the artists that they are.

{"text":"For album number six, Linkin Park drop the softer experimental ambient sounds of their previous two releases for a harder abrasive sound veering on Heavy Metal, with Chester Bennington's screams back. Hard rocking, they take no prisoners, with some studio outtakes included as codas.\n\n\"Keys To The Kingdom\" opens the album with Bennington screaming \"No control...\" and an explosion of guitars alternating with softer harmonious verses, a mix of the old and the new. \"Guilty All The Same\" sounds like their much earlier stuff and features a rap by Rakim. \"War\" is a frenetic rocker with a scorching guitar solo.\n\nFans of their earlier sound will find much to love: \"All Or Nothing\" featuring Page Hamilton, \"The Summoning\", \"Wastelands\", \"Until It's Gone\" (reminiscent of \"Crawling\"), the triumphant sounding \"Rebellion\" featuring Daron Malakian of System of a Down, and the near instrumental \"Mark The Graves\".\n\n\"Drawbar\" is an enchanting instrumental ballad with lovely piano and percussion work, and featuring a criminally underused Tom Morello. \"Final Masquerade\" continues the subdued feel, while closing cut \"A Line In The Sand\" starts off deceptively ambient (like something from \"A Thousand Suns\" or \"Living Things\") till guitars and aggressive drumming kick in.\n\nThis sounds like \"Hybrid Theory\" or even it's prequel like the band have stated. Linkin Park have come full circle.","classification":4,"fold":5}

The radio and MTV didn't play the older songs anymore at that time, and I never noticed them in stores.  I heard Say You Do a few years ago while watching an episode of Soul Train that Janet was on.  I bought this cd before it went out of print.\n\nWhile this and her sophomore record aren't as memorable as Control, there are still some pretty good songs on it.  My favorites are Say You Do, You'll Never Find a Love Like Mine, and Come Give Your Love to Me.  The ballads aren't so great.  The upbeat tracks are better.  Very early 80s R&B, disco, Jacksons, Off the Wall sounds.  Come Give Your Love to Me is more rock\/new wave, kind of a hint at the sound of her next album, which I think is better than this one.  Both are worth buying if you like 80s music.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"My dumb behind didn't know what a quindectet was before I bought this album. I'd never even heard the word used before. It wasn't in any of my dictionaries and my computer refused to recognise it as a proper word. Maybe Michael Brecker made the word up? Ah, whatever. I guess you live and you learn.\n\nI love the idea though. Brecker basically does big band and playing with his fourteen cohorts here gives him the opportunity to paint a canvas of very complex textures upon which to play his beautiful tenor sax solos. The whole ensemble works well but, apart from the bandleader of course, I have a personal fondness on here for Alex Sasha Sipiagin on trumpet, Adam Rogers on guitar and the drummer, Antonio Sanchez (now of The Pat Metheny Group). My favourite songs include \"Broadband\" (which is the opener on my CD and not \"Loxodrome\" as mentioned in the product overview soundclips), \"Night Jasmine\", \"Scylla\" and \"Never Alone\". Gil Goldstein does a great job co-arranging with Brecker and doing the overall orchestration.\n\nI'll always wonder though, if I'd have liked the album more if Vince Mendoza had done it?\n\nStill. Great stuff. Anyone who likes this will probably also like some of the big band stuff Bob Mintzer (the horn man with Yellowjackets) did back in the 90s. So I respectfully suggest you check him out too.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"There is no denying that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross can effectively build a score that resonates deep within the listener. Their scores are a fantastic example of music working with the image, and with Fincher they have become a pretty powerful trio of storytellers. Gone Girl is by far their best score to date. As much as I loved The Social Network, it shouldnt have won the Oscar. Also, The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo was very absorbing but had some structural problems (in that it was a giant blob of score). With Gone Girl it really seems like they nailed the perfectly structured and stylized life unspooled that Fincher was going for.\n\nGone Girl is that perfect twisty thriller score that utilizes Reznors and Ross sonic textures to paint this gentle picture of marriage. That gentle picture starts to deteriorate as the plot moves along. As new information is revealed, the score sort of reflects the interior breakdown of the characters whose lives are slowly coming unspooled. What makes a Reznor\/Ross score unique are of course the synth textures they come up with. They were able to craft some pretty unique stretches of score that build rhythms to set up certain tones. In fact, the score can be pretty manipulative at times in very subtle ways. I found myself attaching to certain characters only to turn on them when an incriminating plot point was revealed. The score played a big part on the ride that I was going on, and it is indeed a ride. This film is just an expertly crafted entertainer, nothing more. Part crime drama, part modern noir mystery, part old-fashioned thriller. Gone Girl gives us lots to sink our teeth into both visually and musically. Finchers vision certainly brings out something unique from Reznor\/Ross.\n\nGone Girl works at a certain level to really dig itself under your skin in a slow and methodical fashion. The score is probably their most structured work to date as it paints quite a graspable narrative even though their process is not to always score to picture. This idea of a perfect marriage being a facade to a deeply disturbing inner turmoil allowed the score to be exactly that. In Reznors own words he wanted to create a sense of rot from within. The music effectively does all of this, especially when you see it with the film. Again, a Reznor\/Ross score will probably never be a wholly pleasant standalone listening experience. So if you're looking for an album to jam out to in the car, look elsewhere as scores should never be assessed for that quality. If you want to hear a supremely effective and stylized thriller that consumes you, then jump right in.\n\nKaya Savas for filmmusicmedia.com","classification":4,"fold":5}

I learned a couple of things about this duo who scraped together different styles as they were developing their own harmonic sounds. This record is pretty much an acoustic fare with their voices and guitars and their original works like Sparrow and The Sound of Silence and He Was My Brother stand head and shoulders above their covering of others songs (yes, even above Bob Dylans The Times They Are A-Changin). The mix is like a stew that gives you different flavors and textures in each bite, and doesnt taste like it really goes together, but every so often you get a particular savory taste that hits some of the right notes and you realize that you're willing to try more.

I can see why this band's album has a rating of a 4.9 out of 5 stars on amazon, they grab ahold of the fan and doesn't let go until the end of the album.  It is only 10 songs and roughly 50 minutes long but they truly blow you away with the lyrics and riffs on the drums and gutair.

{"text":"While Herbert Von Karajan was known mostly as a conductor whose bent was the Austro-German repertoire, I've always thought that Karajan was as good (and sometimes better) in the French and Russian repertoire.\n\nWhile there are many outstanding renditions of Debussy's \"La Mer\" by the likes of Charles Munch, Arturo Toscanini, Pierre Boulez and others; Karajan certainly seems to hold his own, in a fine and very well polished reading that falls just a little bit short in terms of not fully capturing the essence of Debussy's dream-like quality.  Likewise, while a shiny and well-formed \"Pictures at an Exhibition\" seems to be good enough, there are other recordings of \"Pictures\" (i.e. Bernstein\/NYPO) that seem to shine brighter and probe deeper.\n\nAs for Karajan's recording of Ravel's \"Bolero\"; it is excellent; perhaps even better than Karajan himself intended it to be. Something must have been right on the day that this recording of \"Bolero\" was made where the Berlin Philharmonic happened to put together a wonderful recording that fully captures a very raw feeling of intensity despite the fact that the music is all polished and waxed in typical Karajan fashion. It is indeed an irony that while Karajan worked hard to perfect his Beethoven, Brahms and Tchaikovsky, with as many as four or five recordings of the same pieces throughout his lengthy career, that he was able to pull off an ideal \"Bolero\" in one shot.\n\nAll-in-all, four stars each for \"La Mer\" and \"Pictures\"; five for \"Bolero\".","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"The downward spiral away from music with any semblance of song structure continues. The God of Anger Pop, who once created the singularly perfect musical moment that was Pretty Hate Machine, must have reached his seventh day of creation: for he is clearly resting on Ghosts. This is Reznor on a lazy day, bored with nothing better to do.\n\nGhosts I-IV is an organized chaos of happy (and angry and sad) accidents. I imagine a herd (or pod?) of Macs and samplers, pots and pans; left to their own devices, could produce something akin to Ghosts if they tried real hard. And I suspect Trent made exactly what he intended to make.\n\nI admit that I'm still a pathetic hold-out waiting for Pretty Hate Machine II - The Revenge. Thus, nothing less will ever truly satisfy. Ghosts is neither fixed nor broken. It's really not that bad, but it's just not that good. And for a small fistful of dollars, I shouldn't complain.\n\nI certainly like the progressive and revolutionary distribution (a la Radiohead's Rainbows) where the evil middle-man record company is kept out of the artist's and fans' relationship. I have to give kudos to NIN for fighting the good fight. So at worst, Ghosts I-IV will take up some precious space on your iPod. At best, it's harmless background noise. NIN Ghosts is a little haunting but definitely not scary.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"Long before she ascended the throne and donned the mantle of the Queen Of Soul, Aretha Franklin was a child of the church. Franklin's pedigree demanded such, since her father was the famous Reverend C.L. Franklin, and her mother was herself a gospel singer. AMAZING GRACE was Lady Soul's returnto her roots after hitting the secular stride of her fantastic strings of albums on Atlantic.\nRecorded over two days at Los Angeles' New Temple Missionary Baptist Church, AMAZING GRACE finds Franklin backed by her studio band and joined by a choir led by family friend and gospel icon James Cleveland. Franklin's singing is unfettered and filled with a spirit not heard in her secular material. Most interesting is her seamless choice of material. She gives pop songs by Marvin Gaye (\"Wholy Holy\") and Carole King (\"You've Got A Friend\") a spiritual sheen, placing them alongside more traditional fare by Clara Ward (\"How I Got Over\") and Thomas Dorsey (\"Precious Lord, Take My Hand\"). Equally impressive are Franklin's rich arrangements, her interaction with the Southern California Community Choir, and her often overlooked piano playing on such songs as \"Never Grow Old.\"","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"With the possible exceptions of Rufus and Sly and the Family Stone, there is virtually no other band to so successfully marry elements of funk, R&B, and pop as Earth Wind & Fire. Their heavy horns, infectious rhythms, and disco overtones are nothing short of an all-out party, and the digital remastering some of their best-loved tracks are granted here make the aural results all the more delicious.\nFunk workouts like \"Shining Star,\" \"Let's Groove,\" \"Boogie Wonderland\" and the classic \"September\" are solid, irresistible works that age like fine wine, and silky ballads like \"That's the Way of the World\" and \"Reasons\" proved that they could be twice as smooth even when the tempo was half as fast. The band even offers up one of the strongest Beatles covers ever recorded, an irresistibly bright reading of \"Got to Get You Into My Life.\" But their hands-down masterpiece will always be \"After the Love is Gone,\" a simply-perfect cut that boasts flawless vocals, lush horns, and a striking chord progression.\nOf the songs that weren't crossover smashes, some are revelations (\"Mighty Mighty,\" \"Saturday Night\") while others simply aren't up to snuff (\"Serpentine Fire,\" \"Kalimba Song\"). Regardless, for a single-disc collection of a supergroup of Earth Wind & Fire's magnitude, you really couldn't do much better.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"I was hesitant to buy this album because I hadn't heard too many good things about it. For one, the Amazon.com review said, \"Why pick on a girl for taking a chance?\" Why would anyone pick on her? This is a great album that takes her Jewelness to a new level. Her lyrics, while mostly pertaining to love, are still hers in the sense that she puts poetic thought into them. She also has some great message-bearing songs, and then just some fun ones with no need for substance!\n\"Stand\" is the first song and is a great way to kick off the album. It talks about the sadness of the world we live in, how some poor people spend money on drugs and alcohol, there's a lot of violence, and other horrible things. She also mentions how we can come together and make a change!\nI really liked \"2 Find U\" because it talked about the problems of relationships. Though there are mistakes that we make with our boyfriend or girlfriend, we have two choices when fights or things like that happen: 1) we can let the pain win and walk away forever, or 2) we can give eachother a clean slate & start over. Jewel asks for a clean slate in this song, it's very bittersweet.\nHer voice is so cutesy in \"Fragile Heart,\" it's funny! She uses simple sentences and the childlike sound of her voice makes it amusing to me: \"If you want my heart, you have to promise not to tear it apart, 'cause my heart has been hurt a lot.\" It's a cautionary song letting someone know she's had lots of pain in the past and doesn't want that now.\nI must say that \"Haunted\" gave me goosebumps when I first heard it, and still does!!! Though Jewel's liner notes say it's about a stalker (which makes sense if you look at the lyrics), I like to think it's a very dark song about someone who Jewel wants revenge against. She describes how she will \"come to you in the still of the night\" and \"crush you with the burden of sight.\" The music is very creepy and slick, adding to the frightful feel of the song. There's also a little clock ticking in the background, making it all the more paranoid and intense! Remind me not to make her mad! :-)\n\"Yes U Can\" is a song that really doesn't have much meat to it lyrically, but is very fun to listen to! It describes a club scene with cowboys and 'naughty girls.' It's tongue-in-cheek I think, kind of playing on words and stuff. Very good song!\nI think \"America\" might be my favorite song on this album. It talks about the imperfections of our country, from the fact that our president wants us to 'shed blood in the name of liberty' to the deteriorating quality of TV shows. She doesn't just blast America, though, she admits that although she wants to change it she wouldn't leave it if she could.\nYes, Jewel's sound is altered here on this electronic album. But don't think it's crap because of that; like I said, in my opinion it enhances her greatness. Though there are some very computerized songs, there are also ones that are closer to her acoustic style on \"This Way.\" I would strongly encourage every Jewel fan to give this album an honest listen!

{"text":"Cyndi Lauper was an icon of 1980's MTV generation hooray of fake importance. \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\", written by Robert Hazard as a wry comment on sexual mores was uptossed upturned and confetti celebrated as an anthem for pre-adolecent girls wanting to wear colorful clothes and kinda rebel at the same time.\n\nCyndi had much more in mind. She was in a recored band \"Blue Angel\" that sold nothing. She found herself in finding song writers that fit her fairy tale. A classic 1980's LP\/Cass\/CD \"She's So Unusual\" had 4 (Four !) hits  \"Girl's\", the cover of Brains' punkish \"Money Changes Everything\", the Hooter's cover of the ballad, \"Time After Time\", and the winking smirk of female masturbation, \"She Bop\".

With each of these band, there was no recognizable lead singer and that may have been part of the problem for longevity as we're more likely for forget names than faces.\n\nAs of this writing, there's been a recent re-make and re-mastering of this indispensable cut, make sure you pick this one up BEFORE the others!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Yes - wow - the entire set of symphonies with Rene Leibowitz conducting the Royal Philharmonic. Well-played, spirited performances - perhaps a bit old, but still really good. Some nice recordings of what looks like the only Beethoven sonatas disc ever produced with Christopher O'Riley - a bit overdone on the rubato, but still well-recorded and quite enjoyable. The first four piano concertos with Jasminka Stancul, BRTN Philharmonic and Alexander Rahbari - maybe not top tier, but still quite good. The classic Firkusny Emperor - what a truly great pianist - nice! We also have some other chamber works as well as Rahbari's rendering of Egmont, which is pretty decent.\n\nBut I'm not sure what is behind the track repeats? Tracks 89-90 are repeats of 87-88. Tracks 91-93 are repeats of 83-85. Tracks 97-99 are repeats of 35-37. Tracks 94-96 are repeats of tracks 62-64. Huh? Did they run out of Beethoven on their label? No, because Rahbari did the 9th symphony as well, and I wouldn't have minded if they included a repeat of this by a different performer, but what is with repeating the same tracks and re-labeling them?\n\nBut anyhow, what you get here is well worth the money they are asking for for sure.

{"text":"Although existing for a couple previous years as The Human Body Zapp along with their leader Roger Troutman and company really made a splash in the world on this album,surely one of a handful of true funk classics. Produced by none other then Bootsy Collins himself this will probably always be known as the place to find \"More Bounce To The Ounce\" in all it's nine plus minute glory-THE song not only most representative of this band but of the whole electro funk movement in general;an all time classic. But what comes next?Three MORE slices of hefty funk in the amazing \"Freedom\",\"Brand New Player\" and \"Funky Bounce\".These tunes don't have the heavy eletronic moog bass thump of the hit but emphasize the sound of the band itself,the slapping bass,the funky drummer and Roger's playful way with the bluesy rhythm guitar. They are without question helped along by none other then James Brown's former bassist (Boosty at the control booth) and the sheer charisma of these musicians-Roger included.\"Be Alright\" offers a wonderful sing-a-long slice of modernized gospel inflected soul and from there it's right on the the shuffling mixture of Motown and blues of \"Coming Home\" and it makes a GREAT combination. What really surprises me about Zapp in general is the great melodies and pop hooks they are always able to throw into their heavy,blues sprinkled funk. There are bands that can jam and there are bands that can JAM out a tune-THAT's Zapp! And you'll find that here as well as on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Zapp-II\/dp\/B000002KXM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Zapp II<\/a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Zapp-III\/dp\/B00004S8MS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Zapp III<\/a>&nbsp;and every other bit of music Roger got his hands on!

{"text":"The fall run of 1972 does not get noticed as much as it should. Living in the shadow of the Spring tour of Europe is like being located on the dark side of the moon.  We have arrived once again at this amazing year of Dead music and now we find  our heroes riding into Witchita like gunslingers ready for anything to happen.\n\nPeople that take shots at this band have never been lucky to have attended a concert of glory such as the one Dave has selected for us right here. Jerry, is on from the opening notes and this is still a man living young and proud as our hero  is giving 150% all throughout this show. A little extra is a part of everything found here. Jerry is  singing great and his guitar is a mighty gift as he can soar (\"Bird Song\" \"Jack Straw\") and give his best Chuck Berry (\"Promised Land\" \"Around And Around\" \"Johnny B. Goode\") or make a journey outside the galaxy (\"Bird Song\") This is a Garcia show for the books and it proves what we have already told ya' that we like the Captain's trips and we are always ready to take a ride and enjoy another adventure with him.\n\nNot all \"Picks\" are created equal and I sometimes don't get on the bus with some of them but we have gotten a winner here as the most unperfect band that ever was puts the right cards down on the table here with DP 11. This could be used as starter music for a newbie as most of the bands best loved tunes are a part of this set and get shined on by the whole universe. I don't know of a another bunch that play so layed-back and breathe this much fire all the same time but in normal Dead fashion it's just another night.\n\n\"Uncle John's Band\" with lush harmonies, \"China Cat Sunflower\" rolling square into a hot \"I Know You Rider\" and \"He's Gone\" smoldering into a wheat sky, \"Casey Jones\" and \"Truckin\" both sounding like trains at different speeds both on the same track. \"Brokedown Palace\" as sweet as the morning dew and Chuck Berry is the proper way to end it all with Johnny and that guitar.\n\nThe essay by the poster artist for the original show is great reading and I'm glad he was elected to put some of his words down about this show. The photos look lifted from the Spring tour that was somewhere else but as they are new to my eyes it's a pleasure to have them included herein. A shout-out to Dave who has listened  to all of our cries and included a hot segnent of bonus material tacked on to disc three from Oklahoma City performed only two nights prior to this show. \"Playin\" is quite a journey and now we have got it as an official release and not a poor quality audience cassette (as I know it.) Some of us have waited a few decades for magic such as  this to happen.\n\nIt's almost been 50 years of fun and I think we might be celebrating that big party a few months early with this new fantastic set from Kansas.\nFIVE STARS !!!","classification":5,"fold":5}

Without a doubt this is a rock-solid, hard-rockin' batch of new tunes that will thrill most fans of Bob Mould and Husker Du. Some reviewers have called this a \"breath of fresh air\" and a \"return to form,\" noting that previous albums were perhaps \"too mannered and overworked.\" Hmmm ... I like both the old stuff and the newer albums too. Frankly, I really enjoyed the new path that Bob was forging, fusing electronica and dance beats with his trademark buzz of guitars, thinking that this \"new\" sound really suited him. That said, \"Silver Age\" certainly is a nice return to heavy guitar form. Bob sounds energized and inspired and shows no signs of \"advancing\" middle age on these tunes. This is the work of a man who sounds like he still loves making music. And for that we should be very grateful.","classification":4,"fold":5}

After having listened to Sheeran's songs like \"A Team\" and \"Lego House\", it was hard to believe he was capable of creating an energetic, neo-funk song like \"Sing\" (It also reveals how disappointing it is that Timberlake has gone the direction of Sheeran's earlier tracks with his overly sappy album, \"The 20\/20 Experience\").\n\n  One part of the song that I particularly like is in the chorus, right after Sheeran shouts the song's title.  There is an extended \"ohohohohoho\" portion that reminds me of the 'Hammertime' chorus in \"U Can't Touch This\".  It would be good to hear Sheeran continue down this path.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"The group that later became The Miracles was formed in 1955 by five teenage friends from Detroit, Michigan, under the name The Five Chimes. Three of the founding members, Smokey Robinson, Pete Moore and Ronald White had been singing together since they each were around the age of eleven. The group, influenced by acts such as Billy Ward and His Dominoes and Nolan Strong & the Diablos, featured Clarence Dawson and James Grice in the original lineup. A chance meeting with with record producer Berry Gordy Jr. in 1957 would ultimately lead to a contract with Motown records. In addition, Smokey Robinson made major contributions to the success of Motown, a fact acknowledged by label founder Berry Gordy Jr., when he surprised the singer with a corporatevice president title in 1961.\n\nDuring the 1960's the music of The Miracles would become a fixture on Top 40 radio. During that decade The Miracles would amass an impressive total of 24 Top 40 hits. One of the most influential and honored tunes The Miracles ever recorded was released as a single in July 1965. Looking back it hard to understand why \"The Tracks of My Tears\" never made it any higher than #16 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart. Oddly enough Johnny Rivers cover version just a couple of years later was a bigger hit.\n\nIt is reassuring to know that both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Grammy Hall of Fame have seen fit to cite \"The Tracks of My Tears\" as one of the most influential songs in the history of rock and roll. Motown does not get any better than this.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"So I approached Jewel's \"0304\" album with an open mind, knowing full well that the days of \"Who Will Save Your Soul\" are long behind us. It's not the out-right \"bad\" album that I had feared, but it's also not a \"classic\" by any stretch of the imagination.\n\"0304\" (14 tracks, 53 min.) starts of nicely with \"Stand\", with its light-beat dance rhythms. \"Run 2 U\" and \"Intuition\" follow along the same vein, and then it starts to set it: the songs all sound pretty much the same! Oh no! That's the trouble with an album that goes on WAY too long, it all starts sounding the same. Admittedly, there are a couple of outstanding tracks: the dramatic (and non-dance) \"Haunted\", and the name-dropping and culture-referencing \"America\".\nOverall, this is an average, somewhat bland album. What surprises me is that in the liner notes, Jewel writes that this album is \"the first record I enjoy listening to\", which in a way is a put-down to all the fans that have loved her earlier albums. It makes me ache for the knock-out punch of \"Deep Water\/What's Simple is True\/Hands\", from the Spirit album: Jewel was never better.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"Ill admit up front that: 1) I like orchestral soundtracks for movies and 2) I haven't seen this film  or its predecessor.  So my review may be different than the others posted already. And I hope to add some additional info not already covered by others.\n\nThe package states that this is the motion picture soundtrack. Many soundtrack albums are actually the score used and not the exact music played in the film. I can only guess that this was taken from the films audio track.\nAs I noted above, I like orchestral scores and  though the principal orchestra musicians are listed in the CD booklet, there is a lot of electronic music here  befitting the nature of the film. So you will need to like electronic music to appreciate the work of composer Henry Jackman.\n\nThere are two licensed recordings included here as well, and both are at odds with the rest of the score.  First is the 1945 recording by Harry James and his orchestra of Its Been A Long Long While and then comes Marvin Gayes 1972 Motown single Trouble Man. Since I have not seen the film, I cant tell how these fit in  or if they are played completely through in the film  but they fill the last 7 minutes of this 74-minute CD.\n\nThe Cd booklet (noted above) has eight pages but six of them are just full page photos from the film. There is a track list and credits on the other two pages.\n\nYou might want to sample a few of the tracks to see the music style of this score before deciding if this is your type of music. Its all subjective and for me it was just OK  hence the 3 star rating.\n\nI hope you found this review both informative and helpful.\n\nSteve Ramm\nAnything Phonographic\n\n.","classification":3,"fold":5}

Beyond the similarities, the song is catchy and memorable.\n\nIndeed, music is an open door towards uniqueness and creativeness.

Sadly, that has not really been a good case this year, with so many poor collaborations this year like Ciara & Justin Timberlake's Love Sex Magic, there just honestly haven't been much to hear when 2 sing one. For newcomer Keri Hilson, she hasn't been able to score a real strong song since she came out late last year with her debut single Energy. That even has shown with her recent collaboration on Knock You Down with Ne-Yo and Kanye West, the 3rd single frm her debut album In A Perfect World. The song honestly has a fair rhythm that isn't that bad, but I honestly was hoping that there could've been more chemistry with the three of them singing on that track. Keri really could've brought in a bit more to the sound, but that didn't happen. Knock You Down sadly wasn't fully a K.O., but felt like a soft jab to the face. She needs to simply find better songs to make all her own.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":5}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"While I certainly enjoy stomping sacred steel gospel music, I love this more subdued offering from Robert Randolph. I have wanted to get this for some time, and finally got around to getting a copy. I wish I would have done so sooner. Robert talks a walk along the path of his roots. Three classic gospel songs - Travelin Shoes, If I Had My Way, and Dry Bones - are bookended with excerpts from the original recordings. And any CD that pays tribute to Blind Willie Johnson has my respect. Those who want to hear extended solos from Robert on every cut will be sorely disappointed (see negative reviews here). Robert intentionally approaches these tunes of faith with restraint and respect. But there's some high energy here. He funks up Bob Dylan's Shot Of Love and does a great interpretation of John Lennon's I Don't Want To Be A Soldier. The sacred steel solos still bubble up but they propel the arrangements rather than dominate them, a mark of a mature artist. I think once his fans read the liner notes and understand the artistic intent of the project, they may come to have a fuller appreciation of Robert and his music. I thank him and thank God for his talented vision. After just a few listens, I know this CD is going to become one of my lifetime favorites.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I love everything Sevendust has ever done, and I loved the significant evolution that was heard on each of their first 3 albums. Since then, they've continued to put out quality metal, but it seems that they got stuck a few times in terms of direction. \"Seasons\" was an excellent album, but it didn't do much that \"Animosity\" hadn't already done. \"Alpha\" was also great (one of their heaviest), but it didn't do much that \"Next\" hadn't done. I prefer Sevendust when they're heavy, but I felt like \"Next\" and \"Alpha\" were slightly boring compared to earlier stuff...the songs weren't as diverse, and the chugging guitar riffs and the chorus vocals seemed a bit repetitive. Now we have \"Hope and Sorrow,\" the band's 7th album. It's a breath of fresh air, because we see the band getting back to incorporating melody again. \"Inside\" is a great opening tune because it's very heavy and also it sounds like the Sevendust we know and love. \"Enough\" offers a fun guitar riff that breaks the cycle of the chugging guitar riffs from the last 2 albums. The first single, \"Prodigal Son\" is a very basic tune, but it's catchy groove will get stuck in your head almost immediately. \"The Past\" is a mellow tune featuring Chris Daughtry doing some guest singing, and while it isn't a very strong track, it's nice to see the band playing with this style again.\nOverall, this is a typical sounding Sevendust record, and it represents their general sound quite nicely. It's certainly not the strongest album they've put out, but I'm glad they are back to experimenting with different styles again. I think if they had put out another album that sounded like \"Next\" or \"Alpha\" it wouldn't be enough to hold my attention with all the other albums coming out this year. Nice job, Sevendust!","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"\"Gone Girl\" see's the David Fincher, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross partnership continue for Fincher's third movie in a row, following on from 2010's \"The Social Network\" (for which they won a golden globe and an Oscar award) and 2011's \"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\" (which would go on to win a Grammy). At this stage it would sound strange if someone else was to score one of Fincher's movies and it is a role that Reznor and Ross have grown into, they now sound more confident than ever. The score is dark, bleak and sinister, then again what else would you expect.\n\nReznor has described in much detail what Fincher wanted the score to sound like,from that bad music that you hear in massage parlors. If you have seen the movie you will know how the music fits in to certain scenes (I am not about to give anything away for people who have not yet seen the movie). The heaviest sounding track is the centerpiece \"Technically Missing\" with its slow build up before the sound of guitars and heavy beats kick in, it is similar in a way to Reznor's Call of Duty - black ops 2 theme he did a couple of years ago. \"Perputal\" and \"Strange Activities\" both recall 2008's \"Ghosts I-IV\" which is fitting as that is what turned Fincher on to the idea of using Reznor, as he used the music in an early version of \"The Social Network\".\n\nThere is the haunting piano of \"Background Noise\", the type that Reznor is so well known for. Reznor and Ross even go as far as using a full blown orchestra on the brilliant \"Clue Two\". The orchestra creeps up over the end of the track and it is a successful pairing. There is the chilled out ambient piece \"Appearances\". \"Secrets\" begins with a piano before it is over come with some big and heavy beats that surround the rest of the track. Thee is plenty haunting piano, glitched sounds and beats delivered by Reznor and Ross to make this a memorable score that indicates this partnership will continue for a while.","classification":4,"fold":5}

Yet sadly, her last 2 album Basic Insinct and Fantasy Ride didn't have the delivery and the lack of chemistry in her music. Her latest move is trying to get back to a basic sound. Her latest song Sorry wasn't actually her best in her ballads, but is trying to get to a back to basics sound for her fans that connected the way Promise had shown. The song is slightly better than the lack of soul she had with Speechless a few years ago, but honestly not her best song yet. I do think Ciara needs to find better songs than trying to capture a sound similar to artists years ago. Hopefully, there could be better from her down the road.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"Red's rise is pretty remarkable for a christian modern rock band, and their third outing should not disappoint the majority of fans. Though a lot more straightforward than both the previous two albums, Until We Have Faces gives fans the crunchy, flavorful alt rock that they expect out of Red, with even higher volume that before. There are a couple more ballads than before, and that can either be a positive or a negative depending of what kind of fan you are. Red still executes the album with good vocals and a high level of energy though, and that alone keeps the album from falling on its face. Boasting a generally hard sound (though not enough to be classified as hard rock or alt metal), Until We Have faces is an exciting listen.\n\nI think this album vies for \"top album\" honors with End Of Silence. If you liked Pieces off of that record, this release is a good one. If not, its still a quality addition to Red's resume.\n\nTracks to check out:\nFaceless- An epic single, which will surely get many people air guitaring like crazy\nNot Alone- One of the few softer tracks. Pretty atmospheric.\nLet It Burn- Awesome, soaring vocals by Barnes\nBuried Beneath- Ditto\nThe Best is Yet to Come- Hopeful and pretty song\nHymn for the Missing- Dark, haunting, beautiful, and kind of depressing. this track may be my favorite","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Yes, even I, with my limited technological skills, can fairly easily make a mix CD\/mp3...whatever.  I've got most of these songs on 4 to 5 different sources: single, LP, CD, remastered CD, Archive CD, etc. ad nauseum.  What happened to the original conception for a box set; i.e. to provide an historical, well rounded view of the artist with some rare\/previously unreleased (legally) material thrown in to make it more enticing???  No use being longwinded.  There is nothing here to entice a longtime fan who has nearly everything the man has released.  So I draw the line.  I did not buy the last John Lennon remasters,  SHOULD NOT HAVE bought the Harrison Apple years (horrible remasters, only 2 decent LPs ATMP & LIAMW, both already beautifully remastered and reissued), and I will not buy this.

It has not only been sad, it shows that the music industry has missed on great songs. That thankfully doesn't stop Chrisette Michele from making good songs. That has shown from her latest album Epiphany, and its title track Epiphany (I'm Leaving.) The song really brings in the soul appeal she hasn't lost after her debut I Am showed. It really is a short but simple song that mixes nicely from Chrisette's Jazzy Souldul voice, with a mix of Modern R&B sounds. The song is a nice breath of fresh air, especially from the lack of great music on the radio right now. I like the song, and I definitely love the album too.

{"text":"When Nirvana released their second album Nevermind in September of 1991, thankfully it was ignored in its first few months as heavy metal bands like Guns and Roses and Metallica ruled the rock and roll mainstream with their Use Your Illusion 1 and 2 and Black Albums respectively plus Anthrax, Judas Priest and Megadeth released great albums amidst the hair metal trash.\nThen, around either December of 1991 or January of 1992, MTV started playing the video for Nirvana (or as I called them NERDVANA)'s \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and I said to myself, exact words and this was not a made up story and I quote \"I see the lead singer (Kurt Cobain) is a left handed guitarist like Jimi Hendrix and I predict he will die in three years\" end quote. In 1994 (almost three years after this album was released), my prophecy came true as he offed himself like a yellow dog.\nCobain, unlike Hendrix, was a deplorable guitarist and un-revolutionary IMHO!\nNirvana were not revolutionary despite what those fools at Rolling Stone and Spin magazine claim, Nirvana were basically a safe version of The Sex Pistols and The Clash (despite the fact that Dave Grohl was the only true talent in Nirvana as he is a great drummer, singer and rhythm guitarist). It irks me to see people compare this album to real classics like Dark Side of the Moon, Who's Next, Sticky Fingers, Hotel California and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Nevermind is overrated.\nAside Teen Spirit, other lousy songs were \"In Bloom\", \"Come As You Are\" (should have been titled \"Don't Have a Gun\") and \"Lithium\" (who would write a song about a sedative to combat hyperactivity). \"Territorial P*ssings\" sounds like he was writing about a pack of wolves marking their territory. \"Endless Nameless\" was annoying. \"Drain You\" was silly.\nWhom in the blue Hell came up with naming a generation \"X\", last time I checked Generation X was a punk band that Billy Idol was in back in the late 1970s. I get down on my knees and seriously thank God I dove heavily into Queen's music when Nirvana were at their peak. Also, people comparing a real rock legend like John Lennon to, what \"The Motor City Madman\" Ted Nugent aptly called a \"weenie\", Kurt Cobain was like comparing solid gold to tin foil. Lennon was about happiness and wanting peace in the face of all negativity and horror in the world we live in whilst Cobain just whined, complained, p*ssed and moaned and cried about how bad his life was and wanting to die and sounded like a three year old who had his toy taken from him.\nAvoid this and any Nirvana album!","classification":1,"fold":5}

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Much as it was somewhat intimidating when first eyeballing the recorded catalogs of Stevie Wonder and Miles Davis when I was younger,a similar reaction occurred when eyeballing the breadth and scope of Nina Simone's music. At a time when the world of protest music was largely expressed through folk singers such as Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs,Nina Simone was one of the very few people to write and sing about the social concerns of the civil rights movement from an insiders perspective. Her distinctive musical style led the way for many generations of jazz and soul music,from the 70's funk era up to the socially aware end of the hip-hop\/neo-soul scene today. Interestingly enough,she did all of this by being something of a creative non conformist. So this is the first Nina Simone album I ever put my hands on. And here's how I see it.\n\n  Conceptually this album is quite literal as she explores the blues. This is a genre she might have been mildly embarrassed about. Yet she understood it's true purpose to such a strong degree that \"Do I Move You\",her own composition that starts out the album in a manner that she has a full command of the form and authenticity of it's message. On \"Day And Night\",her own \"I Want A Little Sugar In My Bowl\",\"Buck\" and  the ballad \"Since I Feel For You\" she is throwing down some heavy soul with the likes of musicians Eric Gale and Bernard Purdie. Her lyrical and vocal expression reflect both personal and physical longing in almost equal measure. On \"Backlash Blues\" she's back to the 12 bar end of things. Co-written with Langston Hughes,this song realistically deals with the socio-economic inequities bought on from racism that,sadly we're still very much dealing with in the present day.\n\n  While that is a personal favorite of mine here,another is her take of \"House Of The Rising Sun\",interpreted with the full gospel power of the sanctified church and not the typically folksy take on the song whatsoever. She ends the album with \"Blues For Mama\",her collaboration with Abbey Lincoln dealing with unfaithful and abusive men. Of the bonus tracks,the standout for me is the uptempo soul of \"Whatever I Am,You Made Me\". Much as with Miles Davis,the in your face assertiveness of Nina Simone pours out through your brash and sometimes howling vocal instrument and projects an attitude that may not be everyone's cup of tea. However for those who hunger for the soul laid bare,Nina Simone stands out among the Etta James and Aretha Franklin's of her era for her naked expressions of emotion and consciousness. An absolutely revelatory album and highly recommended to those just getting into Nina's music.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Prime Cuts: He Loved Me, At the Cross, In Your Presence\n\nHow can a choir which started out with only 9 members go on to sing at the US 2013 Presidential Inauguration?  How can a group who do not even read music get to sing at the Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall, and Madison Square Garden?  How can choir music, which some have even deemed as pass, go on to win 9 Grammy Awards and multiple Dove Awards?  The answer is find in the titular of their latest release \"Pray.\"  Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir, now a 280-voice team, is celebrating their 20th anniversary this year with an album that gives expression to what has been the powerhouse of this singing team.  Centering around the theme of God's sovereignty accomplished through prayer, this record returns to the traditional sounds that first brought them to the dance as well as the themes that have been igniting their passions this year.\n\n\"Pray\" follows 2013's highly successful \"Love Lead the Way\" with 14 new songs recorded live.  Those who adore the choir's earlier works like \"High and Lifted Up\" and \"God is Working\" will swallow up album opener \"Praise Him\" in a heartbeat.  Introduced by some delightful sounding flute before the gorgeous outburst of a full 280-people power sound, \"Praise Him\" will get you standing and singing in a flash.  Featuring a flamenco-sounding guitar with flourishes of a Jamaican-island sway, \"Sing\" takes to heart the words of the Psalmists to \"sing a new song to the Lord.\"  However, as good as the first couple of songs are, to have with 4 similar-tempo songs running back to back with the third song \"All Power\" running over 7 minutes can feel like a never ending anthem.\n\nSo much better is when the tempo changes with the fifth track \"He Loved Me.\"  Starting off soft, simple and heartfelt before we are engulfed into a tsunami-styled outbreak of sky-reaching notes is this pulverizing ode about Christ's love.  Worship has never been more heavenly than on this A+ ballad.  Similarly powerful is \"At the Cross\" a song so well-served by the dynamic mass choir sound.  If you love to be swept away by soothing sounds of orchestrated strings undergirded by a delightful invitation to enter God's throne room, don't miss out on \"In Your Presence.\"  \"Come to Jesus,\" on the other hand, has a Southern Gospel quartet charm that is itself a must-hear.\n\nOther than a tad too many fast-paced songs all lumped together at the beginning, there's not much to complain about when it comes to \"Pray.\"  If you want to discover the power of true greatness, let this CD led you to pray.","classification":4,"fold":5}

Whatever their sound is it is worth listening to over and over again.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I like this!!!\n\nIt's a slight departure from Meghan Trainor's sound on her first album, but it's well in line with the overall theme of her lyrics. The title \"I Love Me\" is a solid clue into the content of the song. It's all about loving yourself for who you are and not giving a rat's butt what other people think. And that is definitely right in line with the woman who gave us All About That Bass.\n\nI just love Trainor's general theme of being happy with herself and who she is. It's such a positive message and her songs just make you feel good singing them. I mean I'm FAR from her target demographic audience, but she just resonates with me.\n\nExample of the lyrics...\n\n They gonna say all kinds of things\n They'll make jokes about my name\n They gonna try to clip my wings, but I'm gonna fly, I'm gonna fly\n They'll try to play me like a game\n I'll bet they're too scared of the fame\n But I can see it clear when I'm looking in the mirror\n Saying god made me just right\n\nI'm not familiar with the musical stylings of LunchMoney Lewis, who's vocals appear on this track more than Trainor's. But he's good on this song. He's got a bluesy voice signing hip hop rhymes all to a jazzy beat. It's a heck of a combo. Trainor matches his style in this song.\n\nThen there's rhythmic clapping in the background.\n\nIt's all very catchy.\n\nPersonally I don't understand why people don't like it if you don't sound like your previous albums. I mean...so? Abbey Road sounded nothing like Meet The Beatles. I don't hear people raising a fuss about that.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"You may not know his name, but for listeners of a certain age, it won't take long to recognize his contribution to popular music. Luther Ingram was an R&B singer\/songwriter from Jackson, TN. Ingram was best known for the early '70s hit \"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right\".\n\nIngram made his first record in 1965 at the age of 28. His first three recordings failed to chart but that changed when he signed with KoKo Records in the late 1960's. His first hit \"My Honey And Me\" peaked at #55 on the Billboard Hot 100 on 14 February 1970. Many of his songs appeared in the pop and R&B charts, even though Koko was only a small label, owned by his manager and record producer, Johnny Baylor. Koko and Baylor were closely associated with the Memphis based Stax Records label during the height of its commercial success.\n\n\"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want To Be Right\" is a song written by Stax Records songwriters Homer Banks, Carl Hampton and Raymond Jackson and first released by Bobby \"Blue\" Bland. The song is about an adulterous love affair, told from the point of view of either the mistress or the cheating spouse, depending on the gender of the performer. Luther Ingram recorded his version of the tune in 1972. It would become a Top Ten smash peaking at #3 in August of that year. This is the original hit recording.","classification":5,"fold":5}

Estelle and Jussies voices complement each other, wherever Estelle takes the song Jussie is right there with her. The melody and lyrics flow effortlessly. Matter of fact who is writing these lyrics? Im so into the message. All my life Ive been told you cant win because you're on the losing team. Ive refused to accept this and while my friends were protesting for their piece of the Pie I was on my Soap-Box telling anyone who would listen, there is something wrong with a system that requires one person to be down so another person can be on top. Ive had no problem going to battle with an unbeatable foe because I believe my cause goes beyond good and evil. I consider my cause a noble one Life by Design. Now that the dust is starting to settle and the smoke is disappearing I realize this time I did ring the bell, this time I made a rhyme.

It's whiskey-and-cigarette two a.m. music at it's most dramatic.\n\"Lush Life\" meanders a bit, but \"A Stranger In Town\" begins to pick up the pace, and Davis begins to pull out the stops on \"What Kind Of Fool Am I.\"\n\"I've Gotta Be Me\" is an absolute masterpiece, a powerful cry of self-impowerment that is as stirring today as it was upon it's release.  Is it a tad over-dramatic?  Maybe--after all, it's a Broadway tune.  But, for those of us who got downright nauseous listening to \"Candy Man\" four million times, \"I've Gotta Be Me\" is a revelation, a vocal so big and full of life that it just can't be overlooked.  It's old-style Hollywood, old-time Vegas.\nBy the way--anybody else remember watching Davis shoot his six-guns on the old Merv Griffin show?  That was great stuff.","classification":4,"fold":5}

In my opinion, she makes patchy records that often contain moments of greatness, liberally sprinkled with pretentious 'twinkly' nonsense, that is to a large extent unlistenable.

{"text":"This is another fine set from the Bach Guild. The sound quality is variable. The 1956 mono orchestral recordings from Felix Prohaska don't sound very good, even considering the era, but the performances are worth a listen. There are some recognizable performer names in the set, including Alfred Brendel, Antonio Janigro, Julius Baker, Paula Robison, Harold Gomberg and Alexander Schneider. Not surprisingly, they deliver fine performances in mostly-pretty-good sound quality.\n\nThe highlight of the set, though, has to be the Griller Quartet and the legendary William Primrose performing the Mozart String Quintets. Primrose might well have been the greatest violist of the 20th century, and the Griller was a superb group who had been performing together for more than 30 years at the time of these 1959 recordings. I believe that these were the last recordings made by the Griller, as well as their only stereo recordings. And what incredible sound we get from that Golden Age of Stereo! I give both the performances and the sound quality 10 out of 10. The quintets alone are worth many times the cost of this entire set, and the Bach Guild piles another 10+ hours of quality music on top of that. This is yet another no-brainer buying decision: Buy it before the price goes up!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I may be one of the few devotees of a now obscure one-shot summer replacement NBC-TV variety series called \"Mickie Finn's.\" Never missed an episode; loved the quirky, cluttered speakeasy replica where honkytonk pianist Fred Finn and his small band entertained with a mixture of modern and old-timey tunes.\n\nFirst and foremost of the supporting cast was Fred's tall, blonde, buxom wife Mickie (an alias). She sat, always in a tight revealing costume, on the lid of his upright piano and simul-strummed a banjo while nimble-figered Fred tickled the keys, Dimples Jensen blew a left-handed trumpet, Cugar Nelson and Owen Leinhard wailed on trombones, Stormy Gormley alternated between tuba and cello and Spider Marillo pounded out that rhythm on the drums. Curiously missing in this aggregate that often played Dixieland standards was a clarinet.\n\nThe set for \"Mickie Finn's\" was marvelous, supposedly a duplicate of Fred's San Diego nightclub of the same name, which was a fantasy tribute to elegant but kitschy on-the-QT watering holes of the Prohibition era. The show was always fun; there were a number of interesting guest stars like Crazy Guggenheim, Bobby Darin and the Dapper Dans barbershop quartet, and Mickie was always so cool, a genuine star who, like husband Fred and that great ragtime music, has been all but forgotten.\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes NBC ever made was not renewing \"Mickie Finn's\" for the 1966-67 season. Instead, they filled that 9:30-10pm slot with a sitcom called THE HERO. Like the program it replaced, \"Hero\" lasted only 16 episodes. Blame ABC's PEYTON PLACE for both shows' premature demise.\n\nAs for the CAPITOL Records 1965 LP entitled MICKIE FINN'S - The West Coast's No. 1 Speakeasy (ST 2210), its fatal flaw is stated right on the front cover: \"...plus ten violins.\" Additionally, there's two extra trombones, a soprano sax and three guitars. Put 'em all together and it spells: MUDDLE, a musical confusion that is nothing like the Mickie Finn's I remember.\n\nThere are moments before the extra musicians join in that give a good idea of the genuine Fred Finn sound. \"Sidewalks of New York\" is an excellent example of his aggressive playing style, as is the first go-round of \"Five Foot Two.\" Finn's souped-up Voss Nickelodeon gets a serious workout on \"Bumble Boogie.\" The man's speed and note-for-note accuracy is awesome! As for the rest... so-so, alas.\n\nSIDE ONE\n[2:30] More\n[4:09] Sweet Georgia Brown\n[3:47] On the Sidewalks of New York\n[2:56] Dixie\n[4:16] Bumble Boogie\n\nSIDE TWO\n[2:20] Freckles\n[2:45] Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue\n[2:26] St. James Infirmary\n[2:59] Toot, Toot Tootsie! \/ California, Here I Come\n[3:48] The World Is Waiting For the Sunrise\n\nTOTAL TIME: 31:56","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"And I don't really see why. Longtime fans call it their poppiest, and while it's definitely the mellowest, that doesn't mean that it's not noisy or self-indulgent for the mainstream. While the lyrics don't mean all that much, it adds up the eccentricness of the album, making it more fun with each listen. About the only other flaw with this album is that Lee Ranaldo doesn't sing on any tracks on this album.\n\"Bull in the Heather\" is a classic, as is its video with that Le Tigre girl cameoed in it. Kim has an excellent voice on it, as well as it being loved among the fans. The outro part sounds real cool.\nOpener \"Winner's Blues\" is a real nice track, as it's an acoustic-like track, a brilliant track on this album.\nI just love \"In the Mind of the Bourgeois Reader\". It's a punk-like track here, probably the fastest one, and Thurston sounds as if he's having a lot of fun during the recording of it. Then it goes into \"Sweet Shine\" the only song with any real length on the album. It's a great love song.\nShe has some pretty interesting tracks as well. Her style overall has a sexy sound to it. \"Bone\" is very awesome, I love the energy of the drums on it, then the chords are well-progressed. It's just a real memorable one on this album. She sings 7 of the 14 songs.\n'Experiental Jet Set, Trash and No Star' is something that really shines on track 12 \"Tokyo Eye\", a very noisy song. It's very awesome to listen to either in the car or on your stereo.\nThis one's good for introducing people to SY. I got this January of this year, and I think it's excellent. There are some flaws, but overall, I think it's pretty good. The songs are very short, which helps, 'cuz it doesn't really contain enough epic stuff. So yeah, I am recommending it here.

{"text":"Nick Cave has always been about wild contrasts. Recall that after the brutal Murder Ballads came the most beautiful Bad Seeds record, the gorgeously meditative \"Boatman's Call\".  Setting aside the naked aggression of the Grinderman records, the Bad Seeds last full album was 2008's electrifying whacked out blues of  \"Dig Lazarus Dig\" so there is a quiet inevitably that the great man will take a tangential turn. Coming in the shape of 15th Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds record \"Push the sky away\" sees him return with a melancholy beast that is contemplative and measured. This is not the fiery Nick Cave but the one who reflects on the human condition and uses the sea as a metaphor for a cast of subjects leading to the production of a stunning album which is as quietly powerful has any thing they have done to date.\n\nThe departure of Mick Harvey has impacted and into the vacuum he has left steps Cave's soundtrack collaborator Warren Ellis, whose slow instrumentation and ghostly keyboard parts establish an ominous often soured mood. The nine songs here range from the gently rolling \"We no who U R\" which oozes a sultry almost Portishead style atmosphere to the albums absolute standout of the near eight minute \"Higgs Boson Blues\" so wasted it could have be happily located within the grooves of Neil Young's \"On the Beach\". It's a burningly strung out powerhouse saga that name checks an eclectic list that includes Robert Johnson, the Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King was shot in Memphis, Hannah Montana and Milly Cyrus. When at one point Cave sings \"Well here comes Lucifer\/With his canon law, And a hundred black babies runnin' from his genocidal jaw\/He got the real killer groove\" it is almost scary. In between there are great songs like \"Wide lovely eyes\" with its scratchy guitar backdrop and sea motifs see Cave heading \"Down the tunnel that leads to the sea\/Step on the beach beneath the iron skies\". The threatening \"Waters Edge\" continues the aquatic theme has Cave watches the mating game of young local boys with the \"thrill of love\" for the girls from the capital. Yet all that Cave can do is ruefully reflect that \"But you grow old and you grow cold\". Jubilee Street is perhaps the most superficially conventional song in the set, yet its lyrics tell a harsh tale of a red light district  where Cave throws out brilliant images of a man who states that \"I am alone now, I am beyond recriminations\" as the song builds to a huge conclusion. The waves returns with \"Mermaids\" a superb haunting ballad and one of the most gorgeous things that Cage has committed to vinyl. This is juxtaposed by the talking dark blues of \"We are cool\" with its pulsating bass line, and the return of an earlier theme in the rather odd \"Finishing Jubilee Street\" where Cave reflects on the experience of writing the previous song. The album is capped by the undiluted beauty of the almost church like title track, a dark hymn where Cave reflects and painfully questions what \"If you're feeling\/You've got everything you came for\/If you got everything \/And you don't want no more\".\n\nCave is now one of the great modern renaissance men. His ventures into films, books, writing and music are all defined by a vision, which is deeply intriguing, and utterly compelling. In \"Push the sky away\" he has recorded one of his best albums since \"Boatmen's Call\". It begs the question whether it is the best album of 2013 thus far? And the answer is that there is no contest.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Remastered by the same team that did the individual Beatles albums, the \"Blue\" the second part of this \"Best\" of (the first is \"The Beatles: 1962-1966\") isn't as flawed as that set and has a nice selection of key album tracks and singles from the band's albums. Largely selected by the marketing department at Capital at the time with input from George Harrison and a tiny bit from John Lennon, this set runs nearly 90 minutes.\n\nWe get the band's complete singles from the late 60's and early 70's (minus George Harrison's single b-side \"The Inner Light\" which was the b-side of \"Lady Madonna\")as well as key album tracks including the clean opening version of \"A Day in the Life\".\n\nThe sound is quite good for this collection but keep in mind that these do suffer from some mild limiting and some compression was used to make this collection sound a bit more \"modern\" (i.e., \"loud\")like contemporary recordings. Still, what the Abbey Road team did for the songs included here seems like a nice compromise as they don't suffer from the extreme compression of a contemporary CD and overuse of digital noise removal (something the previous set did suffer from).\n\nIs there any reason to get this if you have all the remasters? Not unless you want the \"clean\" opening of \"A Day in the Life\"; the mixes presented here are the same as those for the previous edition on CD (some had hoped that the original stereo mix of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" would be included since it never has appeared on CD).\n\nThe artwork is faithfully reproduced with a gatefold heavy cardboard sleeve and a booklet with info on the release and songs. Highly recommended if you want to have something that provides highlights to The Beatles career although it could have been improved with a couple of additional songs from the band's albums \"The Beatles\" and \"Abbey Road\" since the running time of the CDs would have allowed it.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/1962-1966-The-Red-Album\/dp\/B000002UYZ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">1962-1966 (The Red Album)<\/a>&nbsp;is also recommended although, again, more tracks from \"Revolver\" and the single b-side \"Rain\" should have been included on that 2 disc set (which could have been put on one CD).","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"While basking with the success of the duet classic Jazz Samba, Stan Getz\n  scored another blockbuster hit with this duet masterpiece which he made with\n  Joao Gilberto in 1963 that became one of Bossa Nova's greatest moments as\n  well as Getz' crowning achievement.  Hailed as one of the biggest-selling jazz\n  albums of all time, Getz\/Gilberto had bought two of the Bossa Nova's greatest\n  innovators: guitarist- vocalist Joao Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim, to New\n  York City for the making of the wonderful recording as the album resulted with\n  pure magic.  Starting with the international hit single The Girl From Impanema,\n  the lyrical track set features solid hits, including Corcavado, So Danco Samba,\n  O Grande Amore, a new version of Desfinado and Vivo Sonhando, which they\n  performed with such unassailable beauty.  Astrud Gilberto, who had made her\n  cameo appearance on the session, said that her husband Joao informed Getz\n  that she \"could sing on the recording\", while producer Creed Taylor recall that\n  it took Getz' wife Monica to bring both Astrud and Joao Gilberto into recording\n  studio (Mrs. Getz had the sense that Astrud could make a hit while he himself\n  insisted on Astrud's presence).  Highlighted by plenty of uncanny material it is\n  no wonder that the album was a colossal success, as the musicians performs\n  with effortless grace and honour, which even gave this crowning achievement\n  it's universal immortality as Getz and Jobim pulled off the harmonic perfection\n  in a relaxed charm of it's own.  As the part of the Verve Master Edition Series,\n  Getz\/Gilberto will certainly ring out even more brighter as a timeless landmark\n  from jazz history in greater form.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Kendrick Lamar is one of the very few new rappers out there that knows how to tell compelling stories. He is only 24, but this is a real man that has something to say about the world and not just the same juvenile struggles that mainstream rappers from the Young Money camp or Maybach Music try to do.  Kendrick Lamar tells stories of struggles from his view, from women's point of view and real issues that not a lot of rappers out there would even attempt to address nowadays. Yes, issues such as abortion, bad relationships, violence, drugs have been touched before, however Kendrick Lamar does it in such a clever fasion that it is undeniable that this young MC understands the world in a much broader sense than your college scholar's . At first listen, I will admit Kendrick Lamar is not the easiest person to listen to at times, his voice and personality takes some warming up to if you haven't listened to his music before, but once you do, it is just smooth sailing from there on because this young man is the best thing to come out of Compton since The Game's \"The Documentary\" album.\n\nThis album is a concept album that revolves around two main characters Tammy and Keisha, and the whole album is a narrative about the lives of these two very different people whom ultimately end up in destruction with no viable solution. Section. 80 tells multiple stories from both male and female perspectives of the crack generation during the 80s and how those kids in America in poverty were living. The production on the album is incredible to say the least, every track is DIFFERENT which is what I love about the album. You have some jazzy tracks like \"Hol Up\" & \"Ab-Souls Outro\" which is not what I expect from a westcoast rapper, but then he shows signs of aggresion with tracks featuring rough and rugged beats such as \"Ronald Reagan Era\" \"The Spiteful Chant\" & \"HiiiPower\" which just goes to show how lyrically raw Kendrick Lamar is as a true MC. The album has laidback party tracks as well such as \"Blow My High\" and \"A.D.H.D.\" which helps diversify the album a bit more. But the real heartfelt tracks with storys such as \"Keishas Song (Her Pain)\" and \"No Make-Up (Her Vice)\" is where Kendrick capitializes his amazing artistry. Kendrick raps with such wit and speed (\"Rigamortis\") that he only propels as the album goes on. His flow is awesome, he can easily switch up at almost any time with no sign of deficiant slack. Once again, Lamar really knows how to paint vivid pictures filled with social commentary with real positive messages despite the overuse of the N word as well as b****; but there is a lot of substance on this album and he is really thought provoking that the cursing is simply just in context. Just when I can't praise this album enough, I will just say that this is the direction Hip Hop music should be taking, and from a GROWN Young MC still learning about the world, it is really exicting to see what Kendrick Lamar has in stores for listeners in the future. Kendrick Lamar is wise beyond his years, and considering the other crappy hip hop arists around his age, he is just a breath of fresh air.\n\nTop Tracks:\n1) HiiiPower - produced by J. Cole :) Great lyricism and great delivery from Kendrick\n2) Keishas Song (Her Pain) - weird sounding hook, but truly a beautifully sad story of a broken girl\n3) Ab-Souls Outro - As Kendrick would say, dope instrumentation with a mix of spoken word poetry\n4) Rigamortus - Incredible flow\n5) The Spiteful Chant - direct and in your face, humorous, love the beat and love the hook\n6) Hol' Up - love the jazz inspired production\n7) F*** Your Ehtnicity - Tackles racism and as well as Kendrick Lamar introducing to what kind of person he is\n8) A.D.H.D. - an atmospheric track showcasing Kendrick's agility, not to mention a great party track\n\nI Love the entire album, and if you know good hip hop then you should already own this. #HiiiPoWer","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Hard to believe (or is it?) that I've been listening to Chris Isaak for 30 years. His debut album came out in 1985, and I got it after seeing him on Friday Night Videos.  ....because I liked the music and he was dreamy.\n\nDeep down, his music hasn't changed all that much and he is still dreamy.\n\nHe has a new disk out  - 'First Comes the Night'. For an extra $2, I got the DE-luxe model which has five more songs. I'm a marketer's dream. They see me coming a mile away.\n\nIsaak certainly has a style, and while he's tweaked it here and there, it's never far off course from his origins. And while so many reviewers want to brand him as \"an Elvis\" and there is some of that here (\"I Love the Way You Kiss Me\"), but he is so much closer to \"a Roy Orbison\", yet still his own artist, his own style.\n\nRecording in Nashville and using that cities musicians, it is hardly a \"country\" album, though Rolling Stone reviews it as such. But they are kind of idiots anyways. I will say there are other influences (\"Running Down the Road\"  -  Jerry Lee Lewis, but mostly the keyboards, not the vocals).\n\nLike all Isaak albums, 'First Comes the Night' is fraught with heartache, loneliness, melancholy - everything that Isaak is known for. As always most of it works, some of it doesn't. Well, about half of it works.\n\nI love the title track - though when he sings 'wherever you are' followed by 'you're here in my....' I always assume he'll say 'car', because it rhymes more than 'heart' does. Weeks later, and I'm still going with 'car'.\n\nMost likely, the best song is \"Reverie\". Sure, it starts out with the piano from the Lisa Kudrow show, Web Therapy (which possibly stole it from Suzanne Vega's \"Pornographer's Dream\"), but it is the song I enjoy most on the disk.\n\nA close follow-up is \"Kiss Me Like a Stranger\", that would not be out of place if the Mavericks had covered it - with horns. But I always found Raul Malo and Isaak to be closer in style than most people probably notice.  I dog \"Dry Your Eyes\",  and \"Perfect Lover\" (really Mavericks material!),\n\nAnd oddly, the \"bonus\" tracks are good. Normally, artists who don't have them on the standard album, they tend to be throwaway songs. But four of the five are better than some stuff on the normal disk.\n\nThere are things here that don't work - in my opinion: \"Baby, What Do You Want Me to Do\".  The plucking of violin strings seems out of place, but the vocal arrangement seem to compete with the musical arrangement. \"Insect\" is not bad, but it is not over the top good.\n\nWhile I appreciate Isaak trying to shake things up with the Nashville routine and normally I'd say maybe working with other songwriters strays from who he is, but all the songs I like were co-writes. Maybe the need for three producers made the album less cohesive, I don't know.\n\nDon't get me wrong - 'First Comes the Night' is by no means a bad disk, but it is not Chris Isaak's best work either.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"I love these collections, and will soon write many reviews of the other 100-or-so collections. These are all well worth the price. So, for $0.99, you get 111 tracks. The problem with this program is that some great instrumental works are interspersed with choral works, volume levels change work-to-work, key signatures and sound-stage change, etc. The result is that the works intrude in the study environment, instead of fading into the background. All of these works are available on other collections, each of which costs only $0.99. I would look at the track list from this collection and then buy the composer-specific collections from the same publisher and assemble my own playlist for this purpose from the full works.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"I'm on a voyage of discovery, widening my collection and experience of Prog from the classics of the first generation era I grew up with.\n\nAnd I found The Astonishing somehow having heard not note one from Dream Theater. Found it, bought it, played it.\n\nWow. An astounding product in this day and age.\n\nTwo disc, two hour plus SF rock opera, composed in a heavy prog-rock style. Epic doesn't begin to describe it.\n\nExcellent quality sound. I can hear most of the lyrics above the instrumental goings-on, which is a bonus. I'm old and my ability to discern one sound from many is sometimes not as good as it should be. Laugh away, whippersnappers, it will come one day to you.\n\nAnd packaging production the likes of which I haven't seen since the heyday of gatefold vinyl album covers. It made me sad for the days when I'd have been able to look at it taking up three square feet of space when unfolded. Seriously great artwork and graphic design. The art looks like the sort of stuff Riven had in it - not the subject matter, the hi-def art finishing. Brilliant.\n\nThe booklet is bound into the cardboard sleeve so the whole is sort of like what you got with Fragile in '71 or Living in the Past. Ha. Irony. This harkens back to the days when albums were multi-media experiences, and the listening was done with the cover open and a lyric sheet to hand.\n\nThe story? Well, it's a bit precious but who cares? We are not talking Nebula Award wining SF here, but we know that going in and have no expectations on that score (no pun intended). The playing is virtuoso, the singers in tune (as far as I can tell but I no longer have a perfect musical ear thanks to years of loud noises going in them as often as I could arrange it) and the music melodic with periods of heavy moving in from the west.\n\nAnd best of all, I'm fairly new to second (and third) generation prog rock, and my last Big Find (Glass Hammer) had a few moments when \"referencing\" other, earlier groups fell into pastiche, derailing the listening experience until I was used to it. Dream Theater sound only like Dream Theater to me. Maybe I am not widely experienced enough in the latter day prog rock scene to say that, but I don't care.\n\nI loved this on first hearing. I don't mind challenging pieces but it was a distinct pleasure to come upon one that required no work just to listen to it (sometimes I'm in the mood, sometimes I'm not).\n\nOne of my better discoveries this year.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I have to say this, and many may disagree with me.  This is the best Vai music to date.  The positives - Steve Vai has always been way out there with his beliefs and jargon but this is the first CD in a while that really is true to his music.  Here is what I mean.  Some of his stuff and weird sounds, screaming, deamons, chains echoing, strange lyrics, and just overall a weird funk vibe.  Finally, he has come out with music that is just music.  There are no weird sound effects and hellish sounds in the background.\n\nThe positives: Creamsicle Sunset, Mullach a' tsi, and Sunshine Electric Raindrops are phenomenal!  The best Vai ever!\nJohn the Revelator, a redone song aboslutly ROCKS!  The song is a wall of sound and has to be followed up by Creamsicle Sunset just to let the brain relax after so much rushes at you.\nVloorum and Gravity Storm are very fun rock tunes.\n\n1. The Story of Light\n2. Velorum\n3. John the Revelator\n4. Book of the Seven Seals\n5. Creamsicle Sunset\n6. Gravity Storm\n7. Mullach a' tS&iacute;\n8. The Moon and I\n9. Weeping China Doll\n10. Racing The World\n11. No More Amsterdam\n12. Sunshine Electric Raindrops\n\nAny disappointments - Who and the heck knows what the Story of light is supposed to be about and how all of Steve's weird thoughts form a story with the actual music.  After reading the story of light liner notes - I have to say that Steve has kept the weirdness about him!  However, I must admit that the bonus material is fun to listen too.  Steve seems like a down to earth kind of guy.  As far a musical disappointments, the reading at the end of the Story of Light (the first song) ruins the overall music and listening pleasure of the very first tune.  Not complaining but the first half of the song is so very cool, then turns strange\/boring\/unenjoyable with the reading.  This is just an opinion and may not be shared by all.\n\nThe result overall, when you get down to the music, is that this CD is just plain awesome.  Warning, trying to listen to other music after listening to this CD is difficult because the overall sound quality is totally awesome as well.  Way to go Steve.  MAD\n\nUPDATE: After several months of listening, this album still rocks.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Wow!  This is just amazing! When I first heard about a song titled \"Batman Evolution\" I thought, \"If I were to make a song called 'Batman Evolution', I would take the 1966 Neal Hefti theme, the 1989 Danny Elfman theme, and the 2008 Hanz Zimmer theme, and make a compilation of the three.\"; and I'll be darned if that's not exactly what The Piano Guys did with this one.\nStarting with a quiet intro from the \"Keaton\" theme, it quickly dives into the '66 \"Nana nana nana nana nana, Batman!\" theme. This theme is hard to take very seriously, so this portion is shorter than the other two. That being said, it pays a perfect homage to the original, campy series with a couple \"riffs\" that sound like the \"Pow!, Bang!\" sound effects from the show. There are even vocals shouting Batman! to complete the feel of the original tune. Then it moves onto, probably, the most famous and recognizable of the three: Danny Elfman's 1989 theme. It's easy to picture Keaton's Batmobile cruising through the woods of Gotham, flames licking the road behind it. This portion starts slow, then gets into main gear. The sound gets darker and grittier with the 89 theme. Enough of the theme is in this compilation to satisfy the ones for whom Keaton's Batman is the favorite. Then after a lone cello lilts a small bridge, the Dark Knight theme starts up. At\nthis point, the song gains strength and majesty until it takes up your whole attention. Then, all of the sudden, it ends. On the one hand, it sounds abrupt, and you're left wanting more; on the other hand, it ends exactly the way it should, disappearing into thin air. Just like the Batman.\nI can't wait for the video! Seeing TPG playing amongst the three most famous batmobiles is going to be every bit as impressive as the song.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"The problem I have with Interpol is that they refuse to actually change. Sure, they've added and subtracted a few things along the way, and sure, they have lost their bassist along the way, but strangely, they still sound about the same as they did on their 2002 debut, \"Turn On The Bright Lights\". That being said, each of their albums is equally well crafted, and their standards have not gone down the tubes. But, to continually echo Joy Division on every release gets tiresome.\n\nSo here is the band's fifth studio album, \"El Pintor\" and their first since 2010's self-titled \"Interpol\" release. Have things changed? Not one bit. In fact, I listened to \"Turn On The Bright Lights\", \"Antics\", \"Our Love To Admire\" and \"Interpol\" along with Paul Banks' two solo albums and one EP \"Julian Plenti Is....Skyscraper\", \"Julian Plenti Lives...\" and \"Banks\". And, well, they are all very similar in sound and approach with a few differences between them. However, there seemed to be something more on \"Turn On The Bright Lights\" and \"Antics\". It's as if the band were bolder, more energetic, more serious about themselves. Those first two releases really showed great promise, and then the band began recycling themselves thereafter. Even Paul Banks two solo albums didn't break strongly with the Interpol tradition.\n\nSo, \"El Pintor\" is solid, but like some other reviews here have already stated, nothing new or original. In fact, this album lacks standout tracks as well. The nicest thing that can be said here is that the band wisely keeps the running time to 40 minutes and 10 tracks. So, it's not a tiresome exercise, just a well worn one.\n\nIf I had to pick tracks for possible alternative radio it would be their first single, \"All The Rage Back Home\", \"My Desire\", \"My Blue Supreme\", \"\"Same Town New Story\".\n\nSomeone said they bet this is Interpol's last album.....and it might be, but maybe the band will change and expand their audience in the process. Heck, even Joy Division didn't stay Joy Division, they regrouped and became New Order, and even they didn't stay the same over the years.\n\nHere's how \"El Pintor\" compares to Interpol's previous releases, and Paul Banks' releases:\n\n2002 Turn On The Bright Lights: Four Stars\n2004 Antics: Four Stars\n2007 Our Love To Admire: Three and a Half Stars\n2009 Julian Plenti Is...Skyscraper: Three and a Half Stars\n2010 Interpol: Three and a Half Stars\n2012 Julian Plenti Lives...: Three and a Half Stars\n2012 Banks: Three and a Half Stars\n2014 El Pintor: Three and a Half Stars","classification":3,"fold":5}
{"text":"This is an album that people are going to either really like or really dislike, due to the extreme nature of it, and the fact that it's a raw, low-budget live recording on a two-track recorder in some Minnesota music club. However, I am in favor of this album greatly. Wanna know why? It's 17 songs in 29 minutes. It's frantic power chords and blazing guitar solos. It's nimble, light-speed basslines and breakneck drum work. It's three young men whose vocals are a rallying cry to the spirit of true punk music. It's the feeling of a real live show where everything is happening at once and you don't know what to expect next. Although not as classy, sophisticate, elaborate or complex as such musical giants as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Frank Zappa, or the works of early Genesis, this is some of the greatest rock 'n' roll ever recorded in all its sweatsoaked, headbanging, fistpumping, anthemic glory.

{"text":"The prelude; Michael Jackson and Chris Tucker having a conversation about a girl they're supposedly looking at, though there isn't any background noise to help set the scene; is like the skit at the beginning of Black Or White. It may be funny initially, but it's replay value is nowhere near that of the song it introduces. Listeners of at-least the official album versions of these tracks may, in other words, find themselves skipping past, or at-least zoning-out on, the first several seconds. That means the tracks, essentially the songs, would be better without their preludes. In the case of You Rock My World, the title of which doesn't come across nearly as corny as it should, the song would also make more sense without it. The dialogue implies that the girl is a total stranger to both Chris and Mike, but the song lyrics have Jackson already romantically entwined with her.\n\n\"It feels like I've finally found a perfect love this time,\" he insists before going into one of his best choruses yet. \"You rocked my world, you know you did,\" it goes, utilizing a harmonic vocal stack similar to the haunting Ghosts, \"Who'd think I'd find someone like you to call mine?\" The words are trite; on paper the song would read like a high school crush poem; but the vocal melodies, even on the verses and bridge, are quite awesome. The music, highlighted by dramatic keyboard strings where applicable, is a slinky soul groove that goes back to the relative timelessness of the Thriller album. Despite an unnecessary scratch break near the end; the ad-lib peak section should take the song out; it's producer Rodney Jerkins at his best. It's not Michael Jackson at his best, but it's damn close. If the quality of this love theme is any indication, I'd guess he got the girl.\n\nmarcellee.com","classification":5,"fold":5}

Isaac Holt, 16 May 1932, Rosedale, Mississippi, USA; drums) and Hysear Don Walker (piano). Young and Holt both studied at Chicago's American Conservatory Of Music. They later joined the Ramsey Lewis Trio and were featured on two of the group's best-known singles, \"The 'In' Crowd\" and \"Hang On Sloopy\" (both 1965). Young and Holt then broke away and decided to form their own group which they dubbed Young Holt Trio. The act's debut single on Brunswick Records \"Wack Wack' was a modest national hit peaking at #40 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1967.\n\nAbout a year later pianist Walker was replaced by Ken Chaney. Soon Chaney was out and the act was reconstituted as Young-Holt Unlimited.  Under that name the duo hit pay dirt with the million-selling instrumental \"Soulful Strut\". The song peaked at #3 on the pop charts in January of 1969 making it one of the most popular instrumentals of the decade.  This is the original hit recording,","classification":5,"fold":5}

The song New Shoes is wonderful.  Catchy, poppish, and original without any trace of self consciousness.  Will Paolo be the \"next big thing\"?  Who really knows?  I just want to hear New Shoes again and again.  It is the best song on the album, but the others are pretty good too.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"One Republic's memorable song \"Secrets\" by this time is no secret but every time I hear it, the extremely powerful lyrics and melody never escapes the mind.  The opening drone of the cello that begins the song sweeps the doors open for the listener to a lyrical rendering of dramatic proportions that lead singer Ryan Tedder meticulously performs along with the rest of the band members.\n\n\"Secrets\" possesses a very creative and poetic narration that lends itself to interpretation that only the songwriter is able to completely understand that is dependent on the circumstance.  But for the average listener, the precise instrumentation of the pounding drums and string arrangement as well as Tedder's strong vocals show much intimacy of  the dilemmas that are written within each word of the song.  But what tends to ring out are the lyrics that convey and reveal much about betrayal and misunderstandings and the eventual chanting and giving all the secrets away.\n\nIndeed, a song that may be played more than once and may be placed on the list of the most emotionally charged lyrics.","classification":5,"fold":5}

After they've said all they've had to say, they part ways and go on with their lives. Many of us have been in a similar position and can relate to the characters.

This cover of an early sixties tune reeks of \"I am so coked out that I can't think of anything original to record\" Syndrome- alot of artists suffered from this in the late seventies, with the advent of cocaine as the drug of choice. Coke hampers creativity, but , i guess a lot of these Laurel Canyon artists bought the hype peddled by Jann Wenner in his music rag, Rolling Stone, which by this time had become more mainstream. Jackson Browne has written some great songs (These Days comes to mind) but this Stay cover, with it's overtly \"white cracker\" falsetto by some female singer, is a disgrace!

{"text":"This is a great CD release by the 12 times Grammy Award winner Emmylou Harris, titled 'Hard Bargain'. The legendary Emmylou Harris continues very smoothly & successfully where she left off from the great 2006 collaboration with legendary former Dire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler in 'All The Roadrunning' & her well acclaimed 2008 CD release 'All I Intended To Be'. The MP3 download has 14 great tracks plus a digital booklet (instead of usual 11 tracks on CD). The opening track \"The Road\" is a great opener : great country-rock sound with great vocals. This song is rather very personal one as she sings about the late rocker Gram Parsons. Who died in 1973 at the age of 26 & she sings \"I can still remember every song you played\". Other great tracks include \"Home Sweet Home\" (great country music sound with great vocals), \"Goodnight Old World\" (a slow track with Spanish guitar\/banjo base track with great clear vocals), \"New Orleans\" (up-tempo track with great high-pitched vocals), \"Big Black Dog\" (a rather 'playful' track with a 'staccato sound' but great bass\/guitar\/keyboard combination), \"Lonely Girl\" (a slow track, great high pitched vocals & great melody), \"Six White Cadillacs\" (great bass\/rhythm guitar combination), \"The Ship On His Arm\" (a slow track, great guitar sound & harmonies), \"Darlin' Kate\" (another slow track, great acoustic string pickings with great clear vocals. This song is another personal\/emotional track about her friend\/fellow singer Kate McGarrigle who passed away in January 2010 of cancer at home in Montreal, Canada), \"Nobody\" (up-tempo track with great bass\/rhythm guitar combination, great vocals & melody), \"Cross Yourself\" (great guitar\/vocal combination & great melody) & the closing track \"To Ohio\" (a slow track with great acoustic guitar chords & great Spanish guitar\/banjo sound. This track features the band The Low Anthem creating a great duo with Emmylou Harris). My favourites\/stand-outs\/solid tracks\/gems include \"My Name Is Emmett Till\" (a slow excellent track with great acoustic guitar string pickings, wonderful clear vocals & beautiful melody) & the title track \"Hard Bargain\" (a beautiful guitar 'rich' sound with great vocals & melody). On the overall, this is a well crafted CD release by the legendary Emmylou Harris (no weak track, a well balanced CD of 'varied music sound' including slow, mid-tempo & up-tempo tracks), a highly recommended CD listening.","classification":5,"fold":5}

He takes the page of British Blue-eyed soul that other singers like George Michael and Mick Hucknall of Simple Red have honestly shown with great songs and the distinctive appeal of letting the voice come from the heart. His latest single Lay Me Down, the third single from In The Lonely Hour absolutely works very well. It is a deep song that shows sincerely from the heart. I absolutely like this song a whole lot, as a deep and intimate ballad that really does deliver well, and better than a lot of the joke songs of the past few years.

So why buy it again?\n\nBecause this new 2015 CD reissue is on Big Break Records of the UK (BBR is part of Cherry Red) and I always get a bit excited by their sensationally good Remasters.

The 16-page booklet is the usual BBR fan fest of American 45 repros, trade adverts and band photos intertwined with indepth and affectionate liner notes from noted Soul buff CHRISTIAN JOHN WIKANE. This CD Remaster also comes in one of those round-corner super jewel cases  tasty...\n\nIn some respects  its hard in the distance of 2015 to imagine what a Soul Monster this album really was in 1972 and 1973. Three of the US 45s listed above hit the coveted No. 1 spot on their R&B charts  \"I'll Be Around\", \"Could It Be I'm Falling in Love\" and \"One Of A Kind (Love Affair)\" while the sublime and socially informative \"Ghetto Child\" peaked at an impressive No. 4 (and should have been a foursome with its illustrious predecessors). But even these belie just how good the 'whole' album is - with the exception for me of the vaudeville jazz brass of \"Don't Let The Green Grass Fool You\" which I always thought was wildly out-of-place.\n\nBut the album's masterpiece is the hidden one never edited for a 45  Lead Tenor PHILLIP WYNNE giving it some serious Soul pleading throughout the gorgeous 6:56 minutes of \"I Could Never (Repay Your Love)\" that ends Side 1. Surely this is what great Seventies Soul is all about  written by BRUCE HAWES  it features melody, passionate vocals and a complimentary arrangement that elevates rather than swamps. Another less-famous gem is \"We Belong Together\" where vibes and treated guitars ease in the smooth vocals and heartache of \"...where's the love we said would never die...\" Atlantic chose \"How Could I Let You Go\" as one of the representations of Quality Soul on their Rhino Handmade \"Atlantic Soul\" 4CD Box Set of 2009. And what can you say about the gorgeous \"Ghetto Child\"  a song that resonated lyrically and musically with British and Irish fans - giving it a No. 7 placing in September 1973 on the UK singles charts.\n\nI must admit that the four bonus outtakes that appeared on the 1995 remaster of \"Mighty Love\" (presented as tracks 11 to 14 on this CD) are massively disappointing. Those looking for the sophistication of the album should look away. Far better is the very cool and complimentary Remix by Mike Maurro of \"I'll Be Around\" which bigs-up the intro and emphasizes those wonderful string arrangements  although at 7:06 minutes it kind of outstays its welcome a tad. The Tom Moulton Remixes of \"Could It Be I'm Falling In Love\" and \"One Of A Kind (Love Affair)\" run to 6:40 and 5:51 minutes respectively and do the same trick as the Mike Maurro stab at \"I'll Be Around\"  with \"One Of A Kind (Love Affair)\" definitely coming off best (what a tune).\n\nI've loved returning to this SPINNERS album - I really have - and Im quite certain Soul fans out there will smile just looking at its cover. Well done to BBR for doing the business by this affectionately remembered LP and those halcyon days. Buy it and do the Soul Step with your sister on the kitchen floor like you used to. Or just think of that special girl. \"...Could It Be I'm Falling In Love...\" once again...","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Pick this up not knowing it was a two disc special,  just wanted to see what it was all about.  Fell in love instantly.  Gavin DeGraw is the new Van Morisson! . . sensitive, passionate, lyrical.  He doesn't possess the typical pop idol voice or much less a crooner's voice, what he has is a lot more.  Every emotion, every nuances of each lyric is riding on his unabashingly strong vocals, raw with feelings worn on his sleeve.  Makes a girl weak in the knees!  Chariot\/Stripped is his defining album wether he becames more famous or just a one CD wonder. The second CD is like icing because it showed the process of coming up with the finished product.  It was a nice bonus, highly recommend you listen to this one also.  Each song so masterfully crafted, so poetically written, most are about longings, falling in and out of love but my favorite is \"Over rated.\"  about how after meeting that special someone, everything else seems so ordinary.  So for all of you who are in  love, pre-falling in love, post break-up, or in the process of breaking up, this one's for you, come on, it's okay to be sensitive, it's okay to sing along, just make sure you're in your car, alone, commuting from work, with the windows closed.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I just got this recording this morning. Rarely am I just blown away on a first listen. After the third listen, I knew this was the best work these two old veterans of the music wars have done in years. While it is a trend lately to do duet albums, either with one other artist and many are quite good (I'm thinking Emmy Lou Harris, Tony Bennett, etc.) this  is by far the best. If this album is not nominated in next year's parade of awards shows, something is REALLY wrong in the world, or, the boys put it so well in the second track on the record, \"It All Going to Pot.\" Of course, given their reputations, this song is both socially accurate, but the double entendre is not lost on anyone who are fans of these two.\nThe album begins with the title track and it is a magnificent tribute to their roots, to those who came before and inspired them. You can just hear the prestige and respect in which they hold all the \"old timers\" they mention in the song.\nThe album offers a beautiful simplicity of instrumentation and arrangements. This is so very evident on \"Unfair Weather Friend,\" a song that had to come from the mind of Willie.\nThe homage to Johnny Cash, \"Missing Old Johnny Cash,\" is truly that, a true honoring of the memory of the man who was a legend. It begins with Merle (my guess) sounding so much like Johnny, I thought it was really Johnny. They hint that while they tell amusing anecdotes of Johnny's life, they let on that there is much more to be told.\n\"Live This Long\" is an admission that they would have lived a bit differently if they had known they were going to live as long as they have. How they sing so clearly with their tongues stuck that deep in their cheeks, I'll never know.\nThe only solo effort on the album is Willie's \"Somewhere Between\" and is a classic Willie ballad about love between two people wherein something unknown comes between. It is a beautiful song.\nThe album ends with a tribute to \"The Only Man Wilder Than Me.\" They never reveal about whom they are singing which is a delightful way to end the album and leave the listeners with something to ponder, considering who is singing...\nThis album is a must, in my book, no matter what genre. It's my current holder of the first spot on the second quarter's list of my nominations for Album of the Year.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"If you did not grow up in the 1960's you just might wonder why so many baby boomers continue to be fixated on the music of that decade. The Billboard charts were filled with so many new and exciting sounds. When one thinks of 60's music the British Invasion and Motown immediately come to mind. But there were a number of other sounds that made an impact in the 1960's as well. Sergio Mendes brought his unique blend of Brazilian, jazz and American pop styles to America for the first time in 1966. His music was an instant sensation. Although Sergio Mendes himself did not sing, he was the pianist, arranger, producer and musical director of this unique group. Led by vocalist Lani Hall, Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66 would produce some of the most innovative sounds of the late 60's. The group's second major hit in the USA was a remake of a Lennon-McCartney tune from The Beatles \"Magical Mystery Tour\" album released less than six months earlier. Sergio Mendes re-imagined \"The Fool On the Hill\" and recorded it in his own inimitable style. The record buying public loved it as it spent 12 weeks on the charts and peaked at #6. Yet another great record for the group from South America.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"For \"Listen\", his follow-up to 2011's smash \"Nothing but the beat\", David Guetta said that he changed his working methods, building tracks acoustically rather than adding vocals to a beat. Whatever the method, the result is as impressive as ever. As with any DG album, the list of collaborators is nothing short of stellar. Many of the tracks may utilise familiar formulas, but when they sound this good it is anything but negative. In fact, what I enjoy most about the new album is the creativity with which he pushes the musical envelope with some tracks and the artists that he chooses to collaborate with. Mixing dance, pop and electronica, fantastic beats, killer hooks and a sprinkling of powerful vocals, he has crafted another solid dance album, filled with potential smash hits. Lead single \"Dangerous\" featuring Sam Martin is so out of left field that had me taken aback by its stunning brilliance. But it is \"The whisperer\", his new collaboration with Sia, that will really catch everyone off guard (unless anyone is expecting a piano ballad from him). He may be accused for producing formulaic EDM, but he sure is the golden goose churning out golden egg after golden egg. This might as well be a platinum one.","classification":3,"fold":5}
{"text":"This is a seriously cool sounding song!  The first time I heard it was last night though.  My husband and I were talking about my two pairs of pants I bought this week for church, and I told him I was totally going for the more pant like set first because darn it, I've read the scriptures (read them daily even) and there's nowhere in them that says \"Woman, thou shalt only wear skirts to church.\"  But it's become such an ingrained part of the social metaphorical yardstick of faithfulness people like to measure you against in our church that despite what people see me doing every week with our son, it's going to be seen as scandalous to the point of heresy by some when I show up this Sunday...and I don't think it should be that way.  I think we should just love people, because loving them works a lot better and feels a lot better then judging them. But that's just my opinion on the subject.\n\nAnd probably most people won't say anything to my face, but experience has taught me the rat-a-tat-tat of the firing squad will probably be making the rounds behind my back.  And as we were talking about this, my husband said, \"So you're like the color of boom.\"  And I said, \"Que?\" because I'd totally never heard this song, and then I quipped, \"no, I'm more like the color of ka-boom\"  As in fireworks, because I'm not just loud, I'm also glittery and sparkly all at the same time ;)  And he said, no babe, you totally have to listen to this song (because he'd had it on prime music on his phone) because this sounds like you...and I just laughed as I listened, because he's totally right.  And then I bought the song.\n\nI realize the lyrics can have some different interpretations, but I think it also speaks a lot towards people who feel like they might just be out of sync with the people around them because maybe they're the neon color in the box of primary and secondary colored crayons.  Or the one with glitter and sparkles. And maybe like me, they have trouble coloring in the lines, but their heart is in the best possible places, right?  So I love this song, totally love it, and it made my day better.  And I'm going to be struggling to be singing hymns in my head and not this song when I walk through the doors on Sunday.  But I'll try to be good, because I usually do, in the biblical sense anyways ;)","classification":5,"fold":5}

The Death Of Patroclus\/III. Funeral March\/IV. Armor Of The Gods\/V. Hector's Final Hour\/VI. Death Hector's Reward\/VII. The Desecration Of Hector's Body, Part 1, Part 2...\n\nA conceptual epic. Imagine the world of mythology opening up to welcome a magnificent battle between veritable titans Petroclus and Hector, leading their armies to storm the wall of the great city. A funeral dirge including somber organ, wherein The Warrior swears to avenge Patroclus' death. As punishment {or reward, depending upon the way you look at it}, Hector is defeated, with entrails strewn across the battle field for all to see. Revenge is fulfilled. [28:39]\n\n2. Metal Warriors\n\n \"Every one of us has heard the call... Brothers of true Metal, proud and standing tall... There's Magic in The Metal, there's Magic in us all!\"\n\nReferring to the audience, this is a rallying cry to the 'Metal Warriors' to remain pure in true Metal.\n\n3. Ride The Dragon\n\nOne can literally hear the sounds of mighty dragons arising from the stigeon depths to soar across the skies, blackening the land, ruling the heavens with their fearsome symmetry. Yet there would invariably be those who resonate with this form, seeking to cooperate with their existence, thus using them for their steeds. Reminds this writer of the beautiful rider from the film Heavy Metal.\n\n 4. Spirit Horse Of The Cherokee\n\n\"...Black Hawk, Red Cloud, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse... Geronimo...!\"\n\nHomage to mighty American Native Warriors. Features Eric Adams translating a chanting medicine man recounting the events of the pale-face occupation, immediately proceeding into war drums... the war dance and paint, the drums, and earth-quaking hooves of steeds, arrows, tomahawks, blades, and spears at the ready, to confront the strangers from abroad, who themselves consider these natives devils, and vice-versa. Scalping time!\n\n 5. Burning\n\nAsserts The Darwinian Survival of The Fittest, while watching antagonists perish. Alternations between whispered lyrics in quiet instrumental undulation, and power-driving drums and guitars, combined with Adams' remarkably varied, soaring and sustaining vocals.\n\n6. The Power Of Thy Sword\n\n \"They will know The Power of My sword!\"\n\nAnother inspiring hymn providing motivation to maintain strength and perspective. Almost literally, as those deserving figuratively find themselves at the point of the ritual Sword.\n\n7. The Demon's Whip\n\nBeginning with the sounds of a match-strike igniting a candle, followed by an incantation, the demon is summoned from Hades with bestial malevolence. This song features aggressively-driving guitars, with the sounds of the stinging whip and the explosive strike. Feel The Demon's Whip!\n\n8. Master Of The Wind\n\nA beautifully-inspiring ballad observing the passage of warriors into that rainbow in the sky, where eagles fly, as well as the survivors of battle.\n_________\n\nBesides the Victorious Music, Triumph Of Steel features a mini-poster insert {with lyrics on the other side} actually suitable for framing, featuring The Shadow Warrior emerging triumphant with sword and hammer in hand, accepting empowerment in the form of lightning from the sky, while being surrounded by beautifully demonic, and lustful women. Beneath him, a demon cracks the whip in the caverns of Hades. Powerful imagery to match the potent anthems herein.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"When this first came out over a decade ago from RCA Victor\/BMG it was an instant winner among those Big Band fans starving for some CD material presenting the music of that era in quality AAD sound. Unlike many releases at that time, it even has three paragraphs in the insert describing the usual reception for these renowned groups when their buses rolled into town, along with a re-listing of the generous (for the time) 19 tracks showing recording dates and locations.\n\nWith so much to choose from in terms of material, I have to agree with those who assigned 5 stars to the tracks presented here, each in its own way representative of the music so popular from 1933 to 1940 (the span covered here). And yes, even to the inclusion of Fletcher Henderson's Mary Had A Little Lamb, a 1936 recording featuring a brief vocal by Teddy Lewis, but some of the best instrumental solos ever put to disc. Really, the title and the lyrics are incidental.\n\nThe same reviewer who lamented that selection, also had disparaging remarks for the \"whitebread\" Casa Loma Stomp, only the first of 64 hits for Glen Gray & His Casa Loma Orchestra (named after a famed Toronto nightclub which the band called home for a spell) which hit # 15 in January 1931 (this is a 1933 re-recording), as well as Bunny Berigan's rendition of All God's Chillun Got Rhythm (with vocal by Ruth Bradley). Yes, trying to do that in today's society would go over like a lead balloon - but this was 1937 and that year both Duke Ellington (# 14 instrumental) and Artie Shaw (# 15 with vocal by Tony Pastor) had hits with it.\n\nTheir inclusion in this historical volume is just fine, thank you very much.

Over 64 minutes of the swingin'est singles ever!\" And at a pretty decent price I might add.","classification":5,"fold":5}

My favorite part has to be where he rants on about Enron where he comes up with a law should exist.  \"If you have a company, and it can't explain in one sentence what it does, it's illegal.\"  There are a few parts not found on the DVD, but overall you are better just sticking with the DVD.

That is way too late to finally decide to make a new record. Their original bass player is gone too. It isn't the same without Kim Deal and it definitely shows. Their is a big change in sound with this record which should be expected since were not in the late 80s-early 90s anymore. But I didn't expect such a huge change like this record provided. All in all, its nice to know their keeping their music alive, but its best to just rely on the old stuff to truly see what made them such an influence on music.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"This'l has made a name for himself due to his gritty background, hard voice, and his guest appearances on tracks by some of the premier faces of Christian Hip Hop. This is his fourth album, and it is easily his most diverse. He features a lot of guests, some of whom are clean vocalists, some are fellow rappers. This is also possibly his deepest album, his wordplay has been improving, and it shows here. There are plenty of tracks featuring his slower, crunk-style rap, complete with a very honest and clever lyrical set. This'l does not lack for humility, and it is easy to understand what he is trying to talk about. He is a storyteller. There is also quite a street feeling on this CD, an Ode to This'l roots in a tough neighbourhood. The bass is common, and a low, dark rumble. And there aren't as many synthesized \"poppy\" sounds that artists like Lecrae and Andy Mineo like to lean towards. Its refreshing.\n\nThere are some small knocks though. The album is probably This'l's best, but it still doesn't quite match up with the best in the business. Its close. That's a very good thing. However, there are some filler tracks, with an overuse of repetition, and This'l's flow is a little rough sometimes. He occasionally sounds a little strange with the beat in the background, and there aren't as many lines that punch you in the gut like some albums have done for me in the past.\n\nSome standout tracks are Be King, Rooks, King Without A Crown, and Inside Out. However tracks like Take My Life and especially Do Something About It overuse the same phrase, rendering the track to the point of being called boring.\n\nDo yourself a favor and buy this album if you like rap. Not christian rap, but rap in general. A work like this is easily worthy of your attention. I'm feeling a 3.5 rating for this one.","classification":4,"fold":5}
{"text":"On a good note: the strong hooks that were dominant on Anberlin's 2007 masterpiece \"Cities\" are back for the most part on their new album. 2008's \"New Surrender\" sounded good while it was on, and the lyrics were certainly top-notch. But the songs were not as strong as the material on \"Cities\" and thus it sounded like an album full of b-sides from \"Cities.\"\n\n2010's \"Dark is the Way Light is a Place\" is more radio-friendly than anything this band has done before. At ten tracks, it is also their shortest album. The songs are as sweet as sugar, with big sweeping pop hooks and melodic sing-along verses. The problem is that the lyrics have been stripped down to basic sentiments about love, relationships, and soul-searching. So what we have is ten songs that sound as if they were recorded by a more lightweight band who was trying to sound like Anberlin. The production is flawless, and there is not a single bad song on the entire album. But the sound is so similar to modern day Coldplay mixed with some late 1980's U2, that one could literally sing the lyrics to those bands' past hits to some of these songs. I thought at the time \"Cities\" was released, that it would never be topped, and that just might be the case. But Anberlin has a world of talent, and if their next album is a bit riskier and edgier, they might match or exceed all they have previously done. But these ten songs are polished and spit-shined for the masses, and while some may cry \"sellout,\" others might just wonder why they felt the need to so closely emulate other bands.","classification":3,"fold":5}

It's entirely a matter of opinion, and a review of a song is basically pointless.  I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.\n\nBut youtube exists now.  It's not like you need to base your purchase on what other people think.  You listen to the song, and if you like it enough to want it on your mp3 player (or in better quality than youtube)... (or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.\n\nI guess I'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review...

{"text":"This song has become something of a meme in recent years (it seemed to be a popular one to spoof in Vine videos), but despite this it's still a lovely song.  Upbeat without being overly saccharine, it has a nice blend of piano accompaniment and wistful but still upbeat lyrics.  Vanessa Carlton's voice is a little raspy, but that helps give the song a little charm in my opinion.  A nice antidote to a lot of the overproduced, overly sugary pop songs of today.","classification":4,"fold":5}
{"text":"Rick Ross is one of my least favorite rappers. I don't like his persona, his authenticity, or his lyrical ability. But what I do appreciate about the fat tub of lard is that he has a powerful voice when he raps, and he may delve into his \"Boss\" persona too much, but you have to give him credit for the work he put in before becoming the mogul he is today. Fake or not, he is rich and he will never let anybody forget that. \"Teflon Don\" is not a classic Hip Hop record, this album is all about excess with very little substance to be found on this album, but to be perfectly honest, the music itself is very lavish and hard hitting that I have to give it credit for how catchy the records are. For its commercial purpose, every song on this record could be a potential hit single on urban radios, but of course like as I said earlier each record has the same monotonous theme of money, women and drugs.\n\nThe Production on this album is the highlight, a lot these songs contain tremendous bass with rich layers of strings, ominous choirs, soulful singing and head nodding drums. Songs like B.M.F. (Blowin Money Fast) produced by Lex Luger features his signature overlapping horns and drums and catchy hook by Rick Ross. Aston Martin Music feat. Chrisette Michele and hookman Drake has lush\/sweet instrumentals and one of the more slower tempo songs. Producers J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League and Rick Ross have been collaborating ever since his second album, and their partnership has always been perfect. Lex Luger also brings the best out of Ross forcing him to rap more aggressively. Songs like \"Super High\" features one of the most prettiest beats I've heard in a long while and songs such filled with a great soulful sample. With an album talking about success, this album serves as a testament to Rick Ross's rise ranking in the Hip Hop world collaborating with some of the most revered Hip Hop artists present; Jay-Z, Diddy, Kanye West, T.I., Cee-Lo Green, Erykah Badu & Drake, as well as some of the finest voices in R&B with John Legend, Chrisette Michele and Tony! Toni! Ton!'s Raphael Saadiq\/ Needless to say, this album is a star studded event.\n\nThere are only a few gripes that I have with this album. 1) This album is about nothing but money and success with the exception of \"All the Money in the World\", if you have no desire to listen to someone who likes to brag, then this album would be total BS to you. 2) The songs MC Hammer and B.M.F. transitioning together in sequence of the album sounds too repetitive, being that both songs were produced by Lex Luger it is understandable, but they sound to similar. 3) Rick Ross's voice sounds great, but he has practically the same flow throughout every single song and that just brings the album down a notch. 4) The song No. 1 feat. Diddy and Trey Songz was useless....That being said this is the album of Rick Ross that I think is worth the money. If you like music that bumps hard in your car and you like music that is all about braggadocious intent, then by all means purchase this album.\n\nFavorite 5\n1) Aston Martin Music feat. Chrisette Michele & Drake\n2) B.M.F. (Blowin Money Fast ) feat. Styles P\n3) Super High feat. Ne-Yo\n4) Free Mason feat. Jay-Z and John Legend\n5) I'm Not a Star","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Some gripes here and there, partly with the tracking - I've never heard of \"Anton Hofstetter\" (mixture somehow in someone's mind of Franz Anton Hoffmeister and Roman Hofstetter? The latter, born in Laudenbach in 1742, died in Miltenberg in 1815, is regarded as the likely composer of the Op. 3 quartets. Since this mistake is made, not in the composer info field where it can be fixed by a simple - and single solitary - batch operation at least in iTunes, but in the main data field where it either has to be fixed manually TWENTY ONE TIMES or ignored, this is a mite bit inconvenient. Thank you for doing that. Really. _Use_ the composer field. It exists for a reason. *sigh* Erm. Anyway. :) )\n(That the Op. 3 set was spurious, incidentally and off the point, wasn't suggested\/noticed\/... until the mid-1960s in articles published while these sets of recordings, more or less, were being made.)\nOther works are called spurious here because they're arrangements by other hands of works Haydn -did- write- by which measure the Op. 51 \"Seven Last Words\" should be called at least \"probably spurious\" as well (the orchestral and choral versions being by Haydn, but not the quartet version, beautiful though that also is- and I wasn't saying otherwise; in every form of his in which I know it, it's a wonderful work. Just a consistency point, I suppose...)\n\nThere is an interesting book \"The String Quartets of Joseph Haydn\" with early publication dates, etc. which confirms, by the way, that the Op. 2 nos. 3 and 5 are arrangements of cassations (a point which a misreading of an IMSLP page had led me to doubt when preparing this earlier) and which is otherwise useful for those interested in the early history of his quartets (and a fan should be :) )\n\nAside from that though, which is hardly the performers' fault, one's very glad of the performances- and the most generous, not just in total timing (though it is that) I've encountered- and the opportunity to hear them all together; let's have packaging worthy of them!","classification":5,"fold":5}

I was expecting the cd to sound very similar to 'Strong Tower', which isn't a bad thing since that cd was incredible.\n\nWhile this is still in worship mode, the sound is very different and the band pulls it off extremely well. The best thing I can say about the cd is that it will definitely draw you nearer to God and will pull you into a worship frame of mind while still having a rock flavor to the music.\n\nMy personal favorites are the title track (what an original way to record this classic hymn), Amazed, What Faith Can Do, Everything I Need, and Give Us Clean Hands.\n\nAs always, the original lyrics are very personal and genuine as these rockers continue to humble themselves in praise for our Almighty God. Kutless fans will drink this in and new listeners will be back for more. Excellent cd.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"In 2006, Raekwon made two announcements: One; He's making a sequel to his classic debut, \"Only Built For Cuban Linx\", and Two; He was signing to Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment. While one was exciting (the former), the other was a little disheartening (the latter). Being that Dr. Dre is a bit of a nitpicker, he has a tendency to shelve albums...just ask King Tee, Rakim, and Stat Quo. So, when months and even years passed by, this album started to become existent in name only. It was scheduled for a late 2008 release, but Dr. Dre wasn't happy with the results. Also, the album's executive producer (and Raekwon's labelmate) Busta Rhymes had left Aftermath, which put the project into limbo. So, Raekwon took the masters and left for EMI Records to put out \"Only Built For Cuban Linx, Part II\".\n\nFast forward to 2009, when the album actually sees the light of day. After hearing the album, I have to ask Dr. Dre one serious question... \"What Were You Thinking?\"  This album is a masterpiece from beginning to end, even with its obvious flaws (22 songs...really?). Production on this album is almost flawless, with production from Marley Marl, Pete Rock, The RZA, The Alchemist and the late J. Dilla. Even the two songs that Dr. Dre contributed don't sound out of place.\n\nWhile I love this album enough to say that it is the best hip hop album of 2009, I do have a couple of gripes with it. For starters, some of the songs are unusually short and as a vinyl collector, I was surprised to find out that this album was not available on the vinyl format. Overall, even that doesn't deter my decision...Raekwon has done it again!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Any real R&B fan will tell you that Donell Jones is easily one of the most underrated R&B artists of the late nineties. On his sixth album, Mr. Jones continues to show why he's a force to be recockned with. Unlike recent release by his nineties counterparts Dru Hill & Keith Sweat, Donell wisely avoids using auto-tune on his album. Instead he allows his voice to carry the album to R&B heaven. Driven by the lead single Love Like This which is strictly for the grown & sexy, the album is full of the quality R&B music has been lacking.  My review includes a track by track breakdown.\n\n1.\"The World is Yours\" - The album starts out strong with Mr. Jones answering all of the haters who may have written off in recent years. *** out of ****\n\n2.\"Your Place\" - Another track for Donell fans, it starts off with a intro from his mother, letting him know that his fans have been waiting for him. It has a Chicago steppers vibe to it. *** out of *****\n\n3.\"Love Like This\" - The lead single which didn't get the attention it deserved. **** out of ****\n\n4.\"Imagine That\"- One of the strongest tracks on the album. With this track, Donell is basically telling all the no good fellas, to man up and do right by your lady. *****\n\n5.\"Back Door\" - One of the first tracks where takes it to a sexual level. This is the only song that uses auto tune but only in the back ground. Roger Troutman would be proud. **** out of ****\n\n6.\"Blackmail\"- This song is kind of the fellas answer to Imagine That.  A strong song but it the sequencing on the album kind of throws the vibe off especially after Back Door *** out of ****\n\n7.\"All About the Sex\" - Another sexy slow jam for the ladies. The one thing about Donell, when he's singing about sex, he never goes into R. Kelly territory.  He's able to praise a woman by letting her know it's more than just sex with her. **** out ****\n\n8.\"Stripclub (feat. Yung Joc)\" - I really wasn't feeling the song, it could be because I'm not a Yung Joc fan, however the vocals save the song from the one star rating. *** out of ****\n\n9.\"What's Next (feat. Inessa)\"  - The production on the song was weak and it sounds too similar to the euro pop that Usher recently experimented with. The worst song on the album. * out of ****\n\n10.\"You Can Burn\"  - This is a song for an upcoming artist, I take it as nothing more than filler and since Donell isn't singing the rating is applicable.\n\n11.\"The Finer Things in Life\"  - After a few week tracks, the album picks up steam again. This song has a vibe similar to I'm Gonna Be or You Know That I Love You.\n\n12.\"Just A Little\" - Another sexy slow jam, for the ladies.  **** out of ****\n\n13.\"Oh How I Wonder\" - The album ends out with a message song, which to my knowledge is a first for Donell. **** out of ****\n\nAll in all this is a fine album overall. Along with Eric Roberson, Donell Jones is one of the few artists without major label support making good quality R&B music. Six albums deep into his fourteen year career, Jones has yet to have a weak album. While a cover song or two could have been placed on the album instead of Strip Club or What's Next this is clearly one of the best R&B albums from a male singer in recent memory.","classification":5,"fold":5}

Like her brother Rufus, I like the idea of her, more than I actually like her.\n\nI have heard her sing with her father (Loudon Wainwright III) and she came across much more bluesy than she does on this effort (check out \"You Never Call\" on his live disk). Her voice on this disk hits some qualities of Marianne Faithful (great) to some more alt. generic female lead singer(not so great).\n\nThe good thing (for me) is that she kind of defies a certain style.  It's not that she's all over the place, just that the music doesn't fit nicely into one genre.\n\nWainwright's writing is pretty good for her initial effort. I think that's where all her family's strentgh lies anyway...which is not a knock to their performing abilities.\n\nBut like most disks there are some outstanding tracks: \"When the Day is Short\", \"Wither I Must Wander\" and the oft mentioned ode (?)to her father, \"BMFA\".\n\nIt's at least worth a check-out, if not a purchase.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Hard to believe that it has been a decade since the legendary Johnny Cash passed away. Yet, his music was definitely a cavalcade of absolute talent and brilliance in song as well. But when he did a cover song that was out of the ordinary, he not only made it his own nicely, but it sometimes still stands taller than the original artist in that tone. The prime example of Johnny's musical intimacy came nearly at the end of his life when he did a cover of Nice Inch Nails song Hurt. The song is definitely something still worth listening too. Not just from Johnny's voice, but also because of his simplicity of the guitar and piano. It is a great song to listen too, not just if you are a die hard Johnny Cash fan, but also for anyone who is new to his music. Get this, and you won't be hurt.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":5}

There are jazzy inflections, girl group coquettishness, nuanced phrasing: a full range of tones and textures.

{"text":"Hard to believe it has been 2 years since the world has lost an iconic legend, Whitney Houston. But nevertheless, her voice will always soar past mostly all of today's female artists because the most important asset any female singer has shown, speaks for itself, beyond what any of today's artists have shown like Beyonce' or Rihanna, where many of today's female R&B singer have lost themselves in voice and soul, and have had to be more products than voice through legacy. But Whitney Houston's voice and spirit will always live on not just with her fans and family, but through the legacy of heart and soul she had left behind. I Will Always Love You, her rendition of the Dolly Parton song is the definitive example. The song from the Bodyguard soundtrack is still just as iconic and bold today, as \"The Voice\" had done the song over twenty years ago.

{"text":"For most bands from the past, newer releases leave something to be desired.  This, however, is a really strong effort from the Cult.  I won't say it is an equal to their earlier albums (Love, Electric, or even Sonic Temple) but it is a really good album.  Better than their last two efforts.  These guys (Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy) invented \"alternative\" music.  Heavier than their New Wave counterparts, but more soulful, lyrical and smarter than heavy metal, the Cult have always been a bit of an acquired taste, primarily for those who are a bit more hip than the common trends in music.  I think that with Hidden City they solidify their status as Alternative Gods.\n\nBirds of Paradise, GOAT, Deeply Ordered Chaos and Dark Energy are unquestionable Cult classics, sitting just one notch below Love Removal Machine, She Sells Sanctuary, Rain and Sun King.","classification":5,"fold":5}

They had new albums and new bands from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Los-Lobos\/dp\/B000CCD0F8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Los Lobos<\/a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Blasters\/dp\/B000VUTP4G\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Blasters<\/a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Bodeans\/dp\/B00005Y1Y4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Bodeans<\/a>. They all got sort of lumped into the 'new wave' category, but there was something more going on here. \"Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams\" was one of the best embodiments of this group of bands, and reissue, almost 25 years after the fact, shows why.\n\nThe Bodeans were young and enthusiastic kids who wanted to make their own sound. Being from Wisconsin, they has no burning desire to be trendy or fashionable, just to make music that felt like escape to them. With the first thrilling notes of \"She's A Runaway\" and the rocking theme of breakout the song offers, it's an instant classic that should have slotted in comfortably next to the Springsteen or Mellencamp hits of the day. T-Bone Burnette heard the truth inside the songs and the vocal magic Kurt Neumann and Sam Llanas made, and hauled them away to Los Angeles to make this album. \"Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams\" is a missing link of an album, the chain the runs between The Everly Brothers and The Rolling Stones (from whom the album nicked its title).\n\nThe remaster sounds incredible. The BoDeans were still fresh and excited, with T-Bone at the top of his early production game. \"Rickshaw Riding\" has sudden space in its slowbreathing sound. \"Looking for Me Somewhere\" sounds like Johnny Cash passed on it to hand it over to these youngsters. And the bonus track \"Turn Your Radio On\" makes you wonder why this Chuck Berry-ish rocker got left behind.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"The main flaw of this song has less to do with music than promotion. Epic Records, Michael Jackson's label ever since the release of Off The Wall, is trying to push this as a new single despite the fact that it's (apparently) at-least six years old. Some of the vocals may be new, I don't know, but the music; the drumbeat of which is a replica of Remember The Time; isn't. That's a major marketing glitch that could've easily been fixed by simply releasing the song as an outtake from the Dangerous album. It's also a bad look for producer Teddy Riley, considering the fact that it's only taken six years for his New Jack Swing to sound old.\n\nOther flaws, like lack of bass on a song that should be pounding the club and subpar vocals melodies during the verses, are relatively minor. Aesthetically this is a good song overall. The protagonist, a knife-wielding killer named Susie, is bad, at-least in a moral sense, but the chorus sounds catchy enough, especially during the final peak when Michael Jackson starts hyping it up with his signature ad-libs. The song then goes from good to great for about twenty seconds. \"It was blood on the dance floor,\" Jackson sings with masterful inflections, \"It was blood on the dance floor.\" The last two times he says it are particularly striking.\n\nmarcellee.com","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"There comes a time where we all have to be judgmental and not follow a crowd, or not praise or slander something or someone because it's cool to do. For those few people who've been following my reviews, I'm sure I have an idea what you're thinking. You're probably thinking, \"What Chandler?! You gave Wayne 8 out of 10 stars? You must be on that down south type ****.\" Or could it be \"What? 8 out of 10 stars? No way Chandler! I stuck by your reviews for so long, and this is how you repay me. You gave Masta Ace, and Immortal Technique 8 stars. Is Lil' Wayne just as good as them?\" Whatever reason you're thinking why I didn't give Wayne a low score, because he's overrated and proclaims himself as \"The Best Rapper Alive\", I have a few words for you: Get a life! Just like EJ Rupert said in his review, is it cool to listen to underground and mainstream artists, without slamming one or the other (this goes for half of you people who are on those Amazon threads as well).\n\nWell, as for Lil' Wayne himself, he hits what he proclaims as a \"3 Peat\" with his third follow up in \"Tha Carter\" trilogy. I admit, he has stepped is game up since back in '04 when he came out with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tha-Carter-1\/dp\/B00027JYPI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tha Carter 1<\/a>, which was mediocre (admit it, you only liked it because it was the cool thing to do). But in late '05\/early '06 he came much harder on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tha-Carter-II\/dp\/B000BLI4UG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tha Carter II<\/a>. So can Wayne live up to the hype that he has been swimming in for the past year. When you hear how he rips on \"Mr. Carter\" featuring Jay-Z, the answer is apparently \"yes\". No matter how you match him up with the beats, he'll put them to good use. Just check out \"A Milli\" on how he handles it (and thank you every rapper popular and non-popular for freestyling that beat into the ground). \"Dr. Carter\" has a good concept as Wayne plays a doctor to rappers who are not good. Further down the album is the great and deep song \"Tie My Hands\" featuring Robin Thike. And then is the hilarious \"La La\" with Busta Rhymes and Brisco.\n\nSongs that I don't like in particular is the second single \"Ms. Officer\" (that song get mass amount of airplay, and that \"weedle weedle weedle\" sound is VERY annoying). Some songs just don't make sense, such as \"P***y Monster\" and \"Phone Home\" (trying to be E.T. there huh?)\n\nOverall, a great album. Wayne has hit a high mark in his career. Is he the best rapper alive? No, but he getting up there with everybody else. Which brings me to another thing: Record sales do not determine how great a rapper's skills are. Just becaue Wayne sold \"A Milli\" in a week, does no make this album the best ever made. Many albums have leaps and bounds over this and barely hit platnum (ex: Nas'&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Illmatic\/dp\/B0000029GA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Illmatic<\/a>&nbsp;was relesed in 1994, but didn't go gold until '96 and platnum until 2001). Lil' Wayne may have done his job as an artist with an excellent album. Just like The Rolling Stone Magazine said in their review \"Believe The Hype\" (and gave this 4 1\/2 stars). For me, it's 8 out of 10 in my opinion. Peace.\n\nLyrics: B+\nProduction: B+\nGuest Appearances: B\nMusical Vibes: A-\n\nTop 5 Tracks:\n1. Mr. Carter (featuring Jay-Z)\n2.

{"text":"First of all, I consider Jaheim to be one of the standout male R&B singers of our time.  Unfortunately for Ja, he hasn't found commercial success easily. Sure, GHETTO LOVE and STILL GHETTO went platinum, but it took time and airplay. Last year's GHETTO CLASSICS landed Jaheim in the top spot of the Billboard Chart yet it only went gold (and its chart stay was brief as well)and none of his excellent singles made a splash at radio.  Sad considering \"Everytime I Think About Her\" and \"The Chosen One\" were both fine songs, among Jaheim's most soulful. This time around, Jaheim lands at Atlantic and the difference is noticeable.  Sure, Jaheim sounds as refined yet soulful at the same time, but the production doesn't feel as bombastic or bright as it did on last year's GHETTO CLASSICS.  It's not a bad thing, but despite this album being as consistent as any Jaheim album, it at times feels too safe and reserved. Vocally Jaheim is refined and never overdoes melisma, but you sometimes wish Jaheim would give just a bit more.\n\nThe material is overall fine, but a bit safe. The opening \"Voice of R&B\" has a nice vintage soul feel to it with the horns and 1970s feeling production. Jaheim still possesses his street-savvy persona here despite the soulful underlying production.  On \"Hush\", Jaheim gets his R. Kelly on (literally), though it isn't a complete successin my eyes.  Sure, Ja pulls it off pretty good, but I think Jaheim is better suited with soul-samples and vintage production work - nothing against Kells. It's not bad though, just different. \"Have You Ever\" and \"Lonely\" start to really heat things up while \"Life of a Thug\" truly brings the heat with its wah-wah clavinets, strings, and synthesized horn production.\n\n\"You Just Don't Get It\" isn't bad, though the highlights that follow are incredible.  \"She Ain't You\" is absolutely beautiful and is my personal favorite.  \"Never\" is a bit subtle, but maybe it is the subtlety that makes it so great. Jaheim vocal control is phenomenal here.  \"I've Changed\" features an as of late ubiquitous Keyshia Cole and proves to be solid as does \"What You Think of That\".  \"Make A Wish\" and \"Back Together Again\" are solid as well, if not as exceptional as the aforementioned best (\"Have You Ever\", \"Life of a Thug\", \"She Ain't You\", \"Never\", and \"You've Changed\".\n\nOverall, THE MAKINGS OF A MAN is Ja's fourth consistent effort.  Again, the material is good but safe in a couple of cases.  This isn't a bland effort, but it is even less ornate than GHETTO CLASSICS and there is no \"Could It Be\" this time around.  With that said, there are enough solid numbers to make this album overall enjoyable. 4 stars Ja.","classification":4,"fold":5}

John graduated in 1965 and returned home for benefit performances to raise money for the Maywood Fine Arts Association. a non-profit offering instruction in music, dance, gymnastics and drama for children. The dance studios were destroyed in a fire and proceeds from the Prine shows will help them rebuild.\n\nJohn Prine clearly enjoyed his homecoming and was welcomed to the stage by the high school cheerleading squad. He told stories and sang his songs for more than 4 hours. Both evening's performances were taped and recorded for a future release. I can't wait!\n\nThe music critic for the Chicago Sun-Times raved about the Prine concerts in Maywood and called the Thursday evening concert one of the most memorable shows he had seen in 30 years. I'm know the audience agreed. There were too many moments to list but keep a look out for the DVD release of the shows.\n\nSeeing John Prine in-person has always been a treat for fans.

{"text":"The new album is certainly not bad, I like The Division Bell very much!  But this album just doesn't come across as a Pink Floyd final release.  I think it should have been released as Division Bell outtakes.  I agree with what others have said about the flow from one song to another, at times it seems forced.  The weakest link in the album was Side three.  I liked the portions of Side One that sounded quite a bit like Wish You Were Here and Side Two that leads into the drum piece.  There was a lot of great guitar work on both Side 1 and 2 but by the time it gets to Side Three it starts to sound exactly like Division Bell outtakes or a continuation of On An Island.  Gilmour's style as much as I never thought I'd say this is becoming predictable.  If it was a Pink Floyd album with Waters and the whole band, we would get a much greater diversity than this.  Side 4 is just a few short songs very simplistic sound affects that go on too long leading to Louder Than Words which sounds exactly like a missing song from The Division Bell.  The worst part of The Endless River might be that Dave tried to add too much into it and instead it should have been shorter leaving off a lot of those short songs he was trying to mesh it all together with.  But lets face it this was never recorded or developed into something that was ever going to be a Pink Floyd release.  My actual grade would be 3 1\/2 stars!","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"I've listened to this album so many times in the past and I just cant get over how incredible it is. Everything from the beautifully written lyrics, to 50s Motown sound brought back to the Millennium. I'm really going to miss this gifted woman and I really hope she will be in peace.\n\n1. Love is A Losing Game - Quite possibly the best emotionally driven song ever written and produced. This song has been on constant repeat since I bought the album.\n\n2. Wake Up Alone - So unbelievably sad, but so honest and truthful. Lyrics once again prove that she had to be lonely and crying writing this one.\n\n3. Rehab - Once again, the lyrics tell the truth of what have ultimately took her life. Its scary to see that an instrumental so happy and fun sounding reflects such ironic depressing lyrics but this is the song I fell in love with in the first place.\n\n4. Back to Black - Wow, another strong powerful song about a deceitful lover. Man I can totally relate to this track...\n\n5. Me and Mrs. Jones - Probably the most witty, funny song on the Cd but so catchy and fun to sing too.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"It is a collection that is long overdue.  When John, Paul, George and Ringo founded Apple Records back in 1968 they intended the label to be the home not only for their own music but also for deserving artists they had discovered or were supporters of.  Apple would be a bit different from most other labels in that The Beatles had the financial wherewithal to take chances on unconventional artists and eclectic new sounds.  The boys scoured the countryside for offbeat sounds and brand new artists they thought had potential.  Likewise, they invited some established recording artists back into the studio to cut some new sides for the label.  \"Come And Get It:  The Very Best of Apple Records\" offers up 21 of these marvelous recordings packaged all together for the very first time.  When I discovered this collection online recently I was extremely excited and ordered it immediately.  Included were a number of tunes I had never even sampled before and several others that I had not heard in years.  Add to all of this some familiar hits by Badfinger and Mary Hopkin and this looked to me like a very promising collection.\n\nMary Hopkin was just 17 years old when she was discovered by Paul McCartney in 1968.  She was a Welch folk singer and Paul deemed her voice perfect for a 1920's Russian folk song he was longing to record called \"Those Were The Days\".  Talk about unconventional!  McCartney's instincts were right on the money and \"Those Were The Days\" became a worldwide smash.  A year or so later Mary Hopkin would have another substantial hit in America called \"Goodbye\".  Both songs are included in this collection.  Perhaps you were unaware of this but the group Badfinger began life as The Iveys.  Their debut single \"Maybe Tomorrow\" was also released on Apple in 1968.  I heard this tune exactly once on the radio, loved it and never heard it again until I purchased this disc.  This is a terrific song and one can hear the great potential in this group.  It is no wonder that Apple signed them and as we all know Badfinger went on to have several huge hits.  Many people are unaware that James Taylor also got his start at Apple.  Take a listen to Taylor's debut single \"Carolina In My Mind\" and you will hear Paul McCartney on bass and the late George Harrison doing background vocals.  Great stuff!  The Beatles can also be credited with launching the highly successful recording career of the great Billy Preston during his his stint at Apple.  Enjoy both \"That's The Way God Planned It\" and Billy's version of \"My Sweet Lord\" on \"Come And Get It:  The Best of Apple Records\".\n\nAs I mentioned at the outset the folks at Apple were always on the lookout for new and unique sounds.  Perhaps the most surprising act to be signed by Apple was an outfit known as The Sundown Playboys from Lake Charles, LA.  This was essentially a pick-up band of Cajun players who had recorded a side for a small Louisiana record label.  When one of the band members heard about the philosophy behind Apple Records he decided to send a copy of the disc to the label.  According to the liner notes George Harrison absolutely loved it and decided to acquire the rights to this recording and issue it on Apple.  Meanwhile, you can also sample a rather bizarre version of \"Give Peace A Chance\" by a group known as Hot Chocolate Band.  The collection also includes a mighty fine version of Lennon\/McCartney's \"Golden Slumbers\/Carry That Weight\" by a band that called itself Trash.  Check it out!  One of my favorite cuts in this collection is a rockin' tune called \"We're On Our Way\" by Chris Hodge.  This was a minor hit in the U.S.A. back in 1972 and I actually owned a copy at the time but had not heard it in years. I had always heard of Jackie Lomax who was a contemporary of The Beatles in England but because he never achieved popularity on this side of the pond I had never actually heard any of his work.  You will find a pair or excellent Jackie Lomax numbers included here.  I would have to say that after listening to this album several times my favorite song just might be \"Ain't That Cute\" by Doris Troy.  The Beatles were huge fans of Doris Troy who was a very highly regarded R&B singer back in the day.  Born in the Bronx, Troy had a Top Ten hit in America with \"Just One Look\" in 1963.  But Troy was always more popular in England than in her native America and The Beatles were thrilled to sign her to Apple.  Another legendary recording artist who signed with Apple was the former lead singer of The Ronettes Ronnie Spector .  Her husband Phil was a producer at Apple in 1971 and the label signed Ronnie in the hopes of reviving her flagging career.  While that was just not to be I was glad to see \"Try Some, Buy  Some\" included here.  This is a wonderful song that I had not heard in decades.\n\nNow if you are an avid collector like I am and find yourself the least bit interested I recommend that you snap up a copy of \"Come And Get It:  The Best of Apple Records\" as quickly as possible.  It seems that this anthology was released with very little fanfare and that makes me wonder just how long it will be available.  I must tell you that the re-mastering job on these 40 year old recordings is terrific and I garnered a whole lot of useful information from the 16 page booklet that is included.  It is obvious to me that a whole lot of TLC went into putting this package together.  Very highly recommended!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Sure, Peter Noone was a safe teenybopper idol and the Hermits weren't frequently used in the studio, but what a great string of lightweight pop singles they left behind in the wake of the second wave of the British Invasion. In 1965 alone they had six Top 10 singles (including two No. 1's) and sold millions of records, rivaling The Beatles for chart dominance.\n\nGranted, this music isn't quantum physics, but songs like \"I'm Into Something Good,\" \"Silhouettes\" and \"Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter\" were infectious ear candy for those of us who were barely in our teens in the mid-sixties. One of the first six albums I bought (I now have over 7,000) was INTRODUCING HERMAN'S HERMITS with the three previously mentioned singles on it. It also contained a lot of covers like \"Sea Cruise\" and \"I Understand,\" but this was a singles band which is what makes this such a terrific collection. The only singles missing are their last two to chart in the U.S.--\"Don't Go Out Into the Rain (You're Going To Melt)\" and \"Museum,\" both from 1967.\n\nInstead we're given a handful of failed US singles from 1968 to their breakup in 1970, although several of them hit the top ten in the UK.  Since this is, after all, a UK release it only makes sense that these songs--though unfamiliar to the average American listener--are included in this Best Of package. [Note: No. 1 songs like \"Mrs. Brown\" and \"I'm Henry VIII, I Am\" are on this set, too, even though they were never released in the UK as singles. So this collection seems to be a compromise for fans on both sides of the Atlantic.]\n\nHere is the complete track listing:\n\n1. I'm Into Something Good (US #13, UK #1)\n2. Show Me Girl (UK #19)\n3. Silhouettes (US #5, UK #3)\n4. Can't You Hear My Hearbeat ((US #2)\n5. Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter (US #1)\n6. Wonderful World (US #4, UK #7)\n7. I'm Henry VIII, I Am (US #1)\n8. Listen People (US #3)\n9. Dandy (US #5)\n10. Just a Little Bit Better (US #7, UK #15)\n11. A Must To Avoid (US #8, UK #6)\n12. You Won't Be Leaving (UK #20)\n13. This Door Swings Both Ways (US #12, UK #18)\n14. No Milk Today (US #35, UK #7)\n15. East West (US #27, UK #33)\n16. There's a Kind of Hush (US # 4, UK #7) [Note: Their final US top 10, 1967]\n17. I Can Take or Leave Your Loving (US #22, UK #11) [Note: Their final US top 40, 1968]\n18. Sleepy Joe (US #61, UK #12)\n19. Sunshine Girl (UK #8)\n20. Something's Happening (UK #6)\n21. My Sentimental Friend (UK #2)\n22. Here Comes the Star (UK #33)\n23. Years May Come, Years May Go (UK #7)\n24. Bet Yer Life I Do (UK #22)\n25. Lady Barbara (UK #13) [Note: Their final UK single, 1970]\n\nThe skimpy four-page booklet provides a brief history of the band, only one photo (the cover shot--minus Karl Greene), and a track listing that includes the songwriter and year of release. The CD label says \"stereo,\" but there is no mention of remastering.\n\nLast summer, I saw Peter Noone and a touring version of the Hermits (no original members) at a free concert. It was great fun to listen to him sing the old hits, and this generous 25-track compilation provides a nastolgic trip down memory lane. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED [Running time - 65:38]","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Fifteen years have passed since Bobby Valentino made his debut in the short-lived late 90's group Mista. While they received critical acclaim and commercial success for their 1996 self titled debut \"Mista\", they tried to follow it up with a sophomore album. Unfortunately, the album ended up being shelved and the group would part ways shortly thereafter. In the interim, Bobby laid low by going to college and getting his masters and was unheard from for the first half of the 2000's. He made his debut as a solo artist on Ludacris' 2004 album \"The Red Light District\" on the single \"Pimpin' All Over The World\". A short time later, he released his self-titled debut, \"Bobby Valentino\" in 2005. By the time he released his sophomore album \"Special Occasion\", he was cast aside for fellow Def Jam labelmates Rihanna and Ne-Yo. 2009 saw him leave Def Jam Recordings for Capitol Records to release the long winded but underrated third album \"The Rebirth\". Now, he has returned with his fourth album- and his second under Capitol- \"Fly On The Wall\", an album that is mired in his duality as a performer.\n\nOn this new album, he reunites with his longtime producers Tim Kelley and Bob Robinson, who produce roughly half of the album. He also brings in producers he worked with in the past. Bryan-Michael Cox (who he worked with on \"Special Occasion\") produces the song \"Are You The Right One\". Leland \"Big Fruit\" Clopton, who also produced the song \"Beep\" from his last album produces the ballad \"Last Call For Love\". The production team The Pentagon- a spinoff from The Underdogs- turns in the first single \"Words\" as well as a cover of Bobby Brown's \"Rock Wit'cha\", and the ballad \"Hang On\". Jazze Pha produces the Plies featured \"Phone Number\" as well as \"Altered Ego\" which has an appearance from 50 Cent. While this album is listenable, it suffers from schizophrenia- from an artistic standpoint, at least. Bobby, who has long been critical of the state of present day R&B music, seems to want to play both sides of the fence. On the first half of \"Fly On The Wall\", he wants to make music that is reminiscent of the work of Babyface (See: His covers of the aforementioned \"Rock Wit'cha\" as well as \"Soon As I Get Home\" from \"Special Occasion\"). However, on the second half of the album, he ventures off into making club records, which makes him sound out place- and also making his material sound dated and rather forgettable. \"Fly On The Wall\" could be a much better album if it weren't for his internal struggle between what he wants to be versus what he is trying to be.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Lifehouse went a totally different direction on this album, away from the pop oriented sound on their debut album, and onto a more mature, dynamic sound.  My first few listens were judgmental, and I didn't give the album a fair chance to shine, because I was expecting more poppy hooks and rhythms.  After I let that out of my head, I listened to some pretty excellent music.\nWithout a doubt, the two best songs on the album are \"How Long\" and \"The Beginning\", two of the last songs on the album.  They show maturity as a band, and there is a Pink Floyd kind of feel to them, as the songs make you drift off and you feel like everything will be OK upon listening, and shortly thereafter.\n\"Just Another Name\", \"Anchor\", and \"Am I ever Gonna Find out\" are other stand out tracks, and sort of have a pop sound to them, with catchy hooks.\nJason Wade is a brilliant writer, and has a unique voice.  I look forward to Lifehouse's future work, as they are on the verge of putting out a masterpiece with their current evolution.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"\"Tre!\" wraps up the ambitious three album rocket ride in Green Day's ambitious experiment. Ambition doesn't always yield greatness, and while Uno! felt like a great start, Dos! and Tre! were let downs. \"Tre!\" in particular starts off with a batch of soggy songs that just don't have any kick to them. You really don't get to the good stuff until \"X-Kid\" starts blowing down some doors. Then you get a teenage anthem in \"Sex, Drugs & Violence\" (which chooses to rhyme with \"English Math and Science\"). The best thing here is the segmented \"Dirty Rotten bastards,\" which has a feel more like \"American Idiot\" than the other albums in the trilogy plus has the added feature of some really nifty bass runs from Mike Dirnt. Finally, there's a Beatlesque string drenched power ballad, \"The Forgotten.\" Which isn't bad, but not amazing.\n\nThere's a key line in \"X-Kid\" that's sort of telling.\n\"You're not so young,\nbut you're still dumb.\nYou're an X-Kid\nand you never even got started again.\"\n\nIs this how the band feels about itself? After two of the more successful albums of the past decade, \"Uno,\" \"Dos\" and \"Tre\" feel a lot like the band treading through past glory (and maybe they're waiting for Billy Joe to get out of rehab so they can take these songs out and road rock them), but it feels like the Sandinista Clash. Three albums of sprawl that could have made one condensed kicking single disc, maybe even a double. What they stand as now is a case of overkill.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"Scene: Brought to mind by the snapshot photos that grace each CD in this series. Clintondale Memorial Park, early 1960s, a traditional city-maintained park with the usual kiddies playgrounds, various sports fields, picnic and barbecue facilities, rest rooms and, most importantly, teenage most importantly, many off-the- beaten path secluded spots for teen night sports. Although by the 1960s it was suffering from some neglect since it has been at least a generation since it had been a \"hot\" spot for teenage love in the night. Those \"hot\" spots in this car-driven age are now down at Adamsville Beach a few towns over by the bay, and more recently the new rage at the Gloversville Amusement Park a few towns over going inland out toward farm country.\n\n*******\nLet me tell you about Clintondale Memorial park first, although that might seem funny for a guy who usually starts out describing all the gossip around town, or at least the North Clintondale part of town, about who at North Clintondale High is, or isn't, trying to get some girl's (or more rarely some guy's) attention. Or about who broke up, or didn't break up and I wish she would, with what overreaching guy after what he tried to do down at Adamsville Beach. Or about some other lovelorn bits of trivia that really, now with big issues like war and peace and black civil rights stuff down south staring us in the face, should take a back seat. But what are you going to do when you are stuck, stuck forever it seems, in the backwater of Squaresville, oops, Clintondale, the same thing.\n\nI will get to the people part, the Jeannie Curran and Walter Pitts part, which fills out this saga as soon as I tell you about the park. See, for one thing, I actually had to go to the park in order to able to tell you about it. That may seem odd in a small town, a backwater square town like Clintondale, but I hadn't personally been there since I was a kid, maybe seven or eight years ago. And ever since the Gloversville Amusement Park opened up around that same time there has been absolutely no reason to go there. Period. And when I got older, old enough to ride in a car cruising for girls and other stuff down at Adamsville Beach, which became even truer. This park, whatever it meant for my parents who kept going on and on about how much fun they had there as kids, was strictly nowhere. Or at least I thought so and my opinion didn't change when I took the two mile walk across town to get over there.\n\nFunny when I was a kid the place seemed like a huge primeval forest that a kid could get lost in pretty easily and we were reminded of that hard fact constantly when we played in the woods there. Now it seemed pretty small since I could walk around the whole thing in fifteen, maybe twenty minutes. Sure the old swings, seesaws and slides from childhood were still there, although they seemed to have a little rust on them and didn't look like they had been repaired in a while. And the picnic tables, now a little weather-beaten and standing in serious need of some paint, were still tableau-like in the same places they were back then as were the barbecue pits. The rest rooms had seen better days, could have used a very thorough fumigation, and appeared to have become the \"property\" of the town's increasing population of winos. For that matter the whole layout could have used some serious landscaping or at least something more than a quick summer job student mow and permanent city worker grim reaper swathing. But back in some corners, near the old granite rocks, and a couple of other places off the bridle paths I could see where there might be some very cozy places to bring a date for some serious workouts in the old days. So what my parents, although they neglected to mention that part of the old time teenage \"fun\" night, and Benny Rosen's older brother, David, told us about when the place was a \"hot\" spot might have been true after all. Still this place ain't coming back anytime soon as a serious teenage scene. No way.\n\nLike I say this Clintondale Memorial Park was strictly from hunger. Except, and here you will have to take my word for it, maybe, just maybe, as a meeting place for those who could not meet in public any other place. And that is where Jeanie Curran and Walter Pitts finally get to enter this story. No, hell, no they didn't do any wrong. Anything legally, morally, politically, economically, culturally, or socially wrong. Well, maybe they did on the last one come to think of it. Clintondale, now that people have started moving here from Boston in droves, has gotten over the past several years too big to have just one high school. So now there are two. Jeanie's Clintondale High (the old high school) in the older part of town and Walter (and my) North Clintondale High in the newer section where the housing developments have sprung up. And that is where Jeanie and Walter's \"problem\" takes center stage. See in Clintondale it is taboo, wrong, evil, or whatever you want to call it, but just don't do it, for a student from one high school to date, hell maybe even to talk to, a student from the other high school. Oh sure they can ride on the same buses and stuff like that. It's not like down South with one school riding in the back of the bus or anything like that but no dating. Not done, okay.\n\nBut Jeannie and Walter, are dating, definitely dating, as I will tell you about later. Now the reason I know this is that Walter is none other than a corner boy with me over at Doc Sprague's Drugstore and Soda Fountain. So he kind of confided his story to me. Now every one in town, well in North Adamsville, well, okay at the high school, knows that once I get a story it is going to be around in nothing flat. So I think Walter's idea was to tell it to me and then I would spread it around and then people (read: fellow teenage high school students) might learn to accept his (and Jeanie's) status. And if that was his idea he was right because I am holding you to no vow of silence. Not only that but I half agree that Walter and Jeanie, although they attend those two antagonistic high schools, should have the right to date if they want to and let the town be damned. But I only half agree so far because I can see where these \"mixed\" relationships are hard on everybody and then again, as well, where do you draw the line.\n\nNow this Jeannie Curran, if you know Walter as I do and his tastes in girls, is nothing but a fox. A sandy blonde, nice shape in all the right places, nice face and, so Walter tells me, someone you would never tire of talking to (a big plus, for sure). In other words someone the gods created on one of their good days. Thanks, gods. And Walter is a good-looking guy although not too bright if he both confided in me seriously and was bold enough to go against convention. How they met though will give you an idea as to their problem.\n\nPete's Platters record Shop is the only place in town where kids can go to get rock `n' roll music, the latest stuff anyway. So it is kind of \"neutral\" territory in the high school wars since every kid recognizes, like some Geneva Convention Accords protocol, that teenagers NEED their 45s and LPs and quick, quick as they come out sometimes. So one day, after school Walter was downtown at Pete's looking for Ben E. King's boss sound Spanish Harlem and Roy Orbison's great crescendo-wave Running Scared when he spotted Jeannie. Like some primordial force he was \"driven\" to go over and ask her what she was looking for in records and she answered Patsy Cline's I Fall To Pieces and, almost like it was the power of suggestion, Elvis' dreamy and sad Are You Lonesome Tonight? And that was that. Click. For one thing Walter has just recently broken up with Susie Riley and for another, well, like I said Jeannie was a fox. A fox who, by the way, was wearing front and center her Clintondale High School cheerleader sweater so Walter should have backed off immediately. But such is smitten-ness.\n\nWell one thing led to another after Walter got Jeannie phone number at that first meeting. And as a symbol of friendship he bought her The Drifters' Please Stay right there and then. But things for teenage romance, especially Clintondale never the twain shall meet teenage romance, are never easy. Part of the problem was that Walter did not then have a car and even if he used his father's he couldn't take Jeanie to the Adamsville Beach although she expressed extreme interest in \"watching the submarine races.\" With him. Nor could they go the Gloversville Amusement Park. Nobody from either high school would have stood for that. So Jeannie (like I said Walter is not too bright in the idea department) said why not meet at her house and walk over to the Clintondale Memorial Park and find some quiet spot to \"make out.\" Well, where there is a will there is a way. And so one fine early October night before it got too cold one Jeannie Curran of Clintondale High and one Walter Pitts of North Clintondale High found a nice spot near the old granite rocks and \"did it.\" Here is the funny thing; funny to Walter anyway, while they were \"doing it\" the ubiquitous WMEX rock `n' roll station was playing The Shirelles Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow. They both laughed about that one.\n\nNow that I think of it I could see where \"cruising\" old Adamsville Beach is finally played out. And how many kewpie dolls, rabbits' feet, and leis can you win for your favorite girl over at the amusement park? Those granite rocks over at the memorial park sure were a quiet spot. Now if I could only find a Clintondale High girl to go there with me. And maybe, just maybe WMEX will be playing Brenda Lee's I Want To Be Wanted and we can laugh over that.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"It's as if the last eighteen years hadn't happened. Reuniting in the studio for the first time since their 1997 release, Album of the Year, the San Fransisco based experimental rockers have responsibly recorded an album that die hard fans can declare worthy of the near two-decade-long sabbatical. Sol Invictus picks right up where Album of the Year left off. Having listened to their 1997 effort a bunch of times leading up to the new release, I can say with absolute certainty that Sol Invictus sounds exactly like what I'd have expected from the band in 1999, let alone 2015. In short; they truly meant it when they said they were recording a Faith No More album that sounds like Faith No More.\n\nMike Patton's vocals are amazing as always and his classic delivery has lost nothing over the years. All of his side projects have kept him in top shape and Sol Invictus benefits greatly from that fact. Roddy Bottum's keyboards gives the album the right amount of ambience and ethereal quality. Billy Gould and Mike Bordin's familiar backbone will jump right out at you and Jon Hudson's guitar performance is probably one of his best offerings on this album.\n\nIt's difficult to pin point all the great elements of each song, as I've always approached Faith No More's music as a full-album experience. At least since 1992s Angel Dust. Superhero and Mother, the two lead singles, are hard-driving rock delights, but Cone of Shame and From The Dead really shine a light on Patton's operatic vocal abilities. Matador is a highlight, especially for fans of Bottum's synth playing. Black Friday features Patton's sung-in-spoken word vocals that we've all come to know and love. As an album in its entirety, it comes close to Faith No More's finest work to date. I hope we don't have to wait another eighteen years for a new album, but if it's as good as this one, I'll wait patiently.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"In the world of guitarists you have many types, people who are virtuosos (Vai, Satriani, Eddie Van Halen) use no book, throw it completely out the window and play even by ear. You have people with very unique recognizable styles (Eric Clapton, Slash, BB King, Stevie Ray Vaught etc), who aren't \"super guitarists\" but good in their own right. And strictly by the book guitar players (Tony McAlpine, John Petrucci, Jeff Loomis, Chris Broderick), Berkley school of music by the book perfectionists. Which can become boring quick. The two super \"solo\" guitarists who started all this without a doubt were Vai and Satch, with Hendrix and Halen paving the path before them. While Satriani has enjoyed huge success through the years and given lessons to countless people, and many great albums, Vai has remained \"around\" as i would say with some notable and not so notable albums. Vai has the very trippy, unique, 70's Frank Zappa style guitar playing, and out of key, odd chord progressions, along with various effects to boot. This can be very cool, but also very annoying. The best album Vai has\/had ever done was definitely Passion And Warfare IMO, and hasn't done much since that you can listen all the way through and say wow that's just a great album to put in from beginning to end. While Satch on the other hand makes albums you can listen to, hum along to, and just listen to again and again. And his song writing ability, and creativity far surpasses Vai.\n\nI think Vai is an excellent, technically proficient guitarist with some wild ideas, and super creativity. But as i said that doesn't always make it an enjoyable listen, as much as a lot of out of key noise. There are some slightly enjoyable tracks including Velorum, The Moon and I, and Chasing the world. And they are much more simplistic than the rest of the album. Other artists who do this type of, what i call over dramatic, quirky crazy playing are \"animals as leaders\", \"Devin Townsend\" (mostly his singing and song writing), and even someone like Tony McAlpine with his strange combinations of Jazz and whatever you want to call it. So this is just another album much like the ones he's done over the last 15 years or more. Most songs have no direction for a straight through \"calm enjoyable listen\". And this music is without a doubt an acquired taste. All these guitar players are good in their own ways but Vai just isn't one that i can tolerate anymore. I like the more straight forward, hum along, tab your foot to guitar playing. And the only band i've really heard do this type of music right and make it great is Mastodon (along with their brilliant song writing skills and singing). Get rid of all the wild sound effects Steve, and just make some good guitar music, we all know you can.","classification":2,"fold":5}
{"text":"Jaheim's (J.Hoaglan) sophomore album \"Still Ghetto\" (2002) is an uplifting album to enjoy. Jaheim is blessed with a wonderful, soulful voice which shines through on this release. Jaheim has shown alot love for Hip Hop so it makes sense that he have Kay Gee (formerly of Naughty by Nature) looking after alot of the production on this. The lead single is the inspirational \"Fabulous\" which is about staying positive and making it through the hardest of times. I like this track, The Rayne's guest appearance is good and having the children sing the chorus adds a different feel to the track. Next two tracks are standout, \"Diamond In Da Ruff\" and \"Put that Woman First\" are about appreciating ones lady. Other early songs like \"Me and My B****\" and \"Let's Talk About It\" follow through well. \"Long as I Live\" is about real love, marriage and commitment. Jaheim goes real deep on \"Everywhere I Am\" a beautiful tribute to his mom, a song where you can really feel his genuine love. Mary J and Jaheim drop a memorable collabration on \"Beauty and a Thug\". Slow love song \"Special Lady\" is another track I like. A few tracks particularly the ones at the end- are more filler material for me. However the majority of the tracks are memorable with good reply value. \"Still Ghetto\" is another Jaheim album to enjoy, one I recommend checking out.","classification":4,"fold":5}
{"text":"Producer 9th Wonder started his record label It's A Wonderful World Music Group in 2008. Inside that company were two subsidiaries: Jamla Records (the name itself was a nod to the Motown subsidiary Tamla Records) and The Academy. While Jamla became the more popular of the two, 9th Wonder folded The Academy into its parent company. Even though his aspirations for the company were high, it didn't become sucessful without roadblocks along the way. The first of which was acquiring a distribution deal with Warner Bros. affiliated Asylum Records. Theoretically, it sounded like a good move- were it not for the fact that Asylum seemed to be interested more in the less lyrical side of hip hop. Also, the company seemed to be more into releasing mixtapes, that is until the label's inaugural release was by former 106 & Park Freestyle Friday contestant Skyzoo. He released his formal debut \"The Salvation\" in 2009 in conjunction with Buckshot's Duck Down Records. Over time, there were releases from Big Remo, 9th Wonder, Actual Proof, The Away Team and their most visible artist Rapsody. As their roster expanded, a few jumped ship. Thee Tom Hardy left over creative differences, Skyzoo severed ties to start his own imprint and singer Tyler Woods departed after being relegated to singing hooks on various hip hop songs.\n\nAfter five years of existence, the label finally releases their formal compilation \"Jamla Is The Squad\". The current roster of Jamla is well represented, with appearances from virtually all of the signees. Opening the album is the Actual Proof & TP duet about perserverance \"God Willin'\". Wu-Tang Clan member Masta Killa appears on the song \"No Matter\" as well as the song \"Pretty Bird\". Singer-songwriter BJ The Chicago Kid links up with Add-2 on \"15 Minutes Of Fame\", where he expresses his disappointment with an ex-girlfriend. Rapsody has a solo song with \"Betty Shabazz\" and teams up with Pete Rock and Christian rapper Lecrae on \"Be Inspired\". Singer Heather Victoria has the atmospheric ballad \"Drive Home\", while GQ represents his hometown on \"Rated Oakland\". Rapper Big Pooh makes a surprising appearance on the compilation on \"Bang\", which also has an appearance from Big Remo and HaLo. Terrace Martin closes out the album with the dedication to his significant other \"Shinin' Star\". However, the album's best song is \"No Competiton\", which Talib Kweli teams up with Elzhi and Phonte and deliver a powerhouse performance. \"9th Wonder Presents: Jamla Is The Squad\" is a great compilation from the label. As always, 9th Wonder's artists, record company and production team never disappoint and this project only solidifies it.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Although I had known about their CDs like \"On The Outside Looking In\", \"Coming Out Hard\", and \"On Top Of The World\", I never had bought an 8Ball & MJG CD.  In 1998, I was heavy into No Limit Records and I heard a track on the \"I Got The Hook Up\" soundtrack called \"Let's Ride\" that was pretty tight.  Then once I heard \"Pure Uncut\" which was a track with 8Ball, Master P, Mystikal, Silkk The Shocker and Psycho Drama, I was sold on finally purchasing their CDs.  I bought 8Ball's \"Lost\" CD which included my favorite song \"Coffee Shoppe\" with 8Ball & Redman, MJG's solo CD \"No More Glory\" and eventually once they were relased, \"In My Lifetime Volume 1\" and \"Space Age 4 Eva\".  Two of my favorite 8Ball collaborations are \"Where I'm From\" w\/Mobb Deep on their \"Murda Muzik\" CD and \"Ride(Down South)\" w\/Foxy Brown, Juvenile and Too Short from her \"Chyna Doll\" CD.  You also can't forget about the 8Ball & MJG collaboration from Mase's 1st CD, \"The Player Way\".\nWhen I first learned that 8Ball & MJG signed with Bad Boy I was a little skeptical at first.  I know that Bad Boy does well as far as marketing their artists but I was worried that P Diddy might try to water them down a little bit.  However, I was wrong.  I happened to be watching Rap City one day and the video for \"You Don't Want Drama\" came on I was nearly speechless.  I just remembered turning the volume on the TV real high and nodding to the beat of the track. When I heard the CD, \"Living Legends\" was coming out on May 11th, I knew I would buy this CD the day that it was released.\n\"Living Legends\" definitely will reclaim 8Ball & MJG's spot in the Dirty South game, not that they ever lost their spot, but it had been a minute since they had the beats to back up their potent lyrics.  The first single, \"You Don't Want Drama\" is clearly the best song on this CD.  Shondrae definitely deserves props for this head nodding beat.  Shondrae strikes twice on \"Don't Make\".  In the video for \"You Don't Want Drama\", the video leaves from the club and then moves to the street, so I am thinking that they are still rapping the same song, come to find out that they had switched to \"Don't Make\".  If you are a fan of any 8Ball & MJG singles, then you definitely need to get \"Living Legends\" for these two songs alone.  However, they have more bangers for you as well.  \"We Do It\" is produced by Nasheim Myrick, who has been making beats for Bad Boy artist for years.  This song is as grimy as \"Don't Make\" as you are able to tell the chemistry that 8Ball & MJG have since they have been rapping together for so long.  \"The Streets\" is another banger that features Bun B from UGK as he is tring to carry the UGK name on his shoulders while Pimp C is in jail.  This is another song that can contend as best song on this CD.  \"Shot Off\" features Ludacris as 8Ball & MJG join Luda for a lyrical free for all as all 3 rappers hold their lyrical weight throughout the song.  \"When It's On\" features a nice beat by Yogi as you hear the beat and they have a nice piano drop throughout the song.  \"Look At The Grillz\" features TI and Twista and is produced by Lil Jon.  Lil Jon actually makes a beat where he's not screaming Yeah! and OK! throughout the whole track.  This song should be the next single in my opinion, as TI and Twista are 2 of the folks that are holding the rap game down in their region right now.  8Ball & MJG are allowed to speak about their \"Memphis City Blues\" as well and to tell some personal \"Confessions\".  The beat for \"Memphis City Blues\" has an old school feel to it as 8Ball & MJG speak a few lines about the town they represent.\nOverall, if you are a fan of 8Ball & MJG's earlier CDs, you can't afford to pass up on \"Living Legends\".  Being with P Diddy and Bad Boy has not watered them down at all and as a matter of fact they might be better than ever before.  If you are a fan of the New South which would include Ludacris, David Banner, Lil Flip, Lil Jon & The Eastside Boyz, TI and others then their is nothing wrong with going back to your Down South roots by picking up \"Living Legends\".  Believe me, it will be worth your time.\nJames' Top 6\n1) You Don't Want Drama\n2) Don't Make\n3) Shot Off w\/Ludacris\n4) The Streets w\/Bun B of UGK\n5) Look At The Grillz w\/TI & Twista\n6) Memphis City Blues","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"The album picks up George's career where the boxed set (Strait out of the box) ends, so it covers the period from 1994 to 1998. It shows that George's style was evolving but still firmly rooted in traditional country music.\n\nThe album opens with two songs specially recorded for the album, the first (The best day) being an excellent ballad. The second song (Murder on music row) was first written and recorded by Larry Cordle, a bluegrass performer. Here, George sings it as a duet with Alan Jackson. George rarely sings duets but although there is no obvious reason for this particular song to be a duet, George and Alan clearly enjoyed recording this song. While both George and Alan have made some concessions to the requirements of the contemporary market place, they have both managed to be hugely successful with music that is much closer to traditional country music than most of the music recorded in Nashville these days.\n\nThe remaining tracks are taken from just four albums, these being Lead on (Adalida, Lead on, You can't make a heart love somebody), Blue clear sky (the title track, Carried away, I can still make it to Cheyenne, King of the mountain), Carrying your love with me (the title track, Round about way, One night at a time, Today my word slipped away) and One step at a time (True, We really shouldn't be doing this). Of these songs, Today my world slipped away is a cover of a Vern Gosdin country hit but the others (as far as I know) are original songs.\n\nPicking out highlights in such a strong collection is difficult, but I'll nominate Murder on Music Row, Adalida, Blue clear sky and King of the mountain. If you are new to George's music, this compilation makes a great introduction.","classification":5,"fold":5}

Included with the disc is a 4-page foldout containing song titles\/credits, song lyrics, band photos, and than you's. Recorded at Superstar Studios, West Columbia, SC. Label - Columbia.\n\nCOMMENTS: Judging by the lack of reviews here on Amazon, Crossfade's popularity is waning. Outside of the occasional \"Cold\" from their 2004 debut, and a quick run of \"Invincible\" from this album when it was first released in August '06... I'm not hearing Crossfade on the radio. The problem here is... the songs are down-right average. The players are competent, but the melodies just aren't memorable. The other issue is there are too many bands putting out the same style of music... but, with better tunes (out of the group listed above, Breaking Benjamin is probably the best). With that being said, there are some decent songs here - the opener \"Washing The World Away\", the semi-hit \"Invincible\", the moderate rocker \"Breathing Slowly\", and the piano ballad closer \"Never Coming Home\". Crossfade's debut was better, but not by much (at least it had one full fledged hit). \"Falling Away\" is a tamer group of songs - an average album that meets and occasionally exceeds expectations (2.5 stars).","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"I honestly never thought I'd end up becoming a Kesha fan, but here I am.  While I greatly enjoyed Animal for all it's upbeat party songs, but this album features a slightly more serious (and softer) set of songs.  I wouldn't say it's better or worse than Animal, just different.  I'll now go through all of the songs in order and talk a bit about each.\n\n\"Warrior\" (5\/5) - The album starts off strong with its title track.  This is sort of a power anthem for all the misfits out there.  Like many previous Kesha songs, this one touches on themes of reckless freedom and the struggle to maintain that freedom to exist outside common cultural norms.  Unlike previous songs, though, this one is the most aggressive about asserting its message, and helps start the album off with a punch of energy!\n\n\"Die Young\" (5\/5) - I love this song.  It's really a testament to living in the moment and the fragility of life.  While it's technically a \"party\" song, it has an edge to the lyrics that reminds us to beware our  impending mortality and thus strive to live life to the utmost fullest - all wrapped up in a catchy chorus.\n\n\"C'mon\" (5\/5) - Much like \"Die Young\" this song also attempts to convey the idea of living for the moment (\"I don't want to think about what's gonna be after this\/I wanna just live right now\") .  Unlike \"Die Young\" though, this one couches the theme in a love story (or perhaps a 'lust' story?).  Kesha's trademark sexuality is present and powerful here, making this song both lusty and yet also strangely touching.\n\n\"Thinking of You\" (5\/5) - This song talks about a cheating boyfriend.  I get the sense it's a bit of a \"revenge song\" in that Kesha seems to be rubbing her fame in this unnamed guy's face.  Fine enough, I suppose.  It's not the deepest nor most interesting lyrics, but the music is good and holds my attention well.  Also, I must note that it's worth getting the explicit version to hear Kesha say \"suck my d***\" in this song, which is pretty darn funny.\n\n\"Crazy Kids\" (5\/5) - I love the whistle-y background music in this song - it really adds an interesting sound to the song.  Lyrically, this seems to be yet another sort of \"anthem\" to irreverent freedom and joyous indulgence for all the \"crazy kids\" out there, but unlike \"Warrior\" this one has a bit more of a subdued tone.  The song really draws the listener into that world, as though we too can get a glimpse into what it's like to to truly not give a f*** and just enjoy life.  It's beautiful.\n\n\"Wherever You Are\" (5\/5) - This one's another love-related song, but this time about a lost love.  With lyrics like \"wherever you are\/know that our love will never die\" one would think this is about Kesha pining for this previous boyfriend.  I see it more as the idea that she's tucked away a special place in her brain for that memory, not so much that she's actively pining for him.  Even when we break up with someone, that emotional connection isn't so easily severed and those feelings just sort of settle into the back of our minds somewhere - pushed aside but not entirely forgotten.  Either way, it's a lovely song.\n\n\"Dirty Love ft. Iggy Pop\" (5\/5) - This is a great, high energy song!  It's really a tribute to shameless, totally physical, unbridled sexuality, and I love it!  This song also helps show off her vocal range.  There's not much more to say but that.\n\n\"Wonderland\" (5\/5) - This song is absolutely lovely, but it's also rather depressing.  Not depressing in the traditional sense, but it captures that horrible, creeping feeling that will claim us all eventually - that feeling of getting older and coming to realize that the previous fun, carefree lifestyle is forever lost to time, not because the specific situations are unable to be recreated, but because they have lost their meaning to someone who's grown more experienced in life and has lost the careless naivete necessary to full appreciate those experiences.  The atmosphere in this song is a special kind of existential sadness not easily captured by a pop song, and I applaud Kesha for it, even if it's not always the easiest thing to listen to.\n\n\"Only Wanna Dance With You\" (5\/5) - This is yet another love song, this one showing off Kesha's more emotional side.  Not a whole lot to say about it - it's a rather pretty song, and I like it.\n\n\"Supernatural\" (5\/5) - As though to contrast the more emotional \"Only Wanna Dance With You\", this song is very clearly about exploring love purely through sensual bliss and physical pleasure.  However, it is no less beautiful than her more emotional songs.  I really appreciate this positive portrayal of sexual expression and this is definitely one of my favorite songs on the album.\n\n\"All That Matters (The Beautiful Life)\" (5\/5) - While this song continues the thematic elements from \"Die Young\" and \"C'mon\", to me it's really more of a sequel to \"Crazy Beautiful Life\" off the Cannibal EP.  In this song, Kesha even more strongly affirms the value of seizing the moment and enjoying the many pleasures  of life to their fullest.  It's a very uplifting song that reminds us that \"all that matters is the beautiful life\" and that's all that really should matter given the brief time we have to exist...\n\n\"Love Into The Light\" (5\/5) - From the title one might be lead to believe this is just another standard love song, but it's really not.  This song is actually about imperfection (and specifically denouncing those who believe she has to be some sort of role model for society), and learning to love yourself with your flaws despite criticism from others.  It's a nice song and a good addition to the album.\n\n\"Last Goodbye\" (5\/5) - This is a bonus song off of the Deluxe Edition of Warrior.  This is another rather standard song about missing an ex-boyfriend, but it's nicely pulled off with genuine emotion and is  pleasant to listen to.\n\n\"Gold Trans Am\" (5\/5) - This is also a bonus song from the Deluxe Edition.  It has an almost country sound, and has a strangely patriotic theme to it (\"love you till you're seeing stars and stripes\", \"gonna take you for a freedom ride\") while also displaying Kesha's typically healthy sexual appetite.  It's just a generally fun-sounding song, and an enjoyable listen.\n\n\"Out Alive\" (5\/5) - This is the third bonus song.  This song has an apocalyptic feel to its lyrics.  There's a real sense of impending doom in this song, and rather than feelings of desperation, there's more a sense of resignation.  The narrator embraces the idea that struggling against fate is futile and instead endorses the idea of just accepting it and essentially \"living it up tonight\" and riding out the end of the world in a haze of hedonistic pleasures (a point emphasized by the upbeat tune).  It's also possible that this song is not literally about the apocalypse but is actually just using apocalyptic imagery as a metaphor for the human condition.  Lines such as \"no one's getting out alive\/all the gold on Earth\/it won't buy time\" seem to imply the idea of mortality and how no one, no matter how much money they have and how much they struggle, can avoid their inevitable demise, so they \"might as well give up the fight\" and essentially just try to enjoy life as much as possible before it's gone (i.e. \"live it up tonight\").  Well, whichever interpretation one may choose, it's still quite a powerful and visceral song.\n\n\"Past Lives\" (5\/5) - This is the last bonus song on the album, and quite possibly the best love song Kesha's ever written.  I like the use of reincarnation as a theme since it's a unique take on a love song, and besides that, the song just sounds so sweet and romantic.  Plus, points to Kesha for having a line where she imagines a past life where she's a man in a polygynous tribe (\"maybe you were one of my wives in a long lost tribe\").\n\nOverall Score (5\/5): NOTE this score is not a mathematical average of previous scores; it's my subjective overall score.  While I enjoyed this release, I recognize how it might alienate her previous fans.  A lot of the autotune-heavy, electronic sound that was apparent in previous songs like \"Tik Tok\" and \"Take It Off\" is conspicuously toned down for this album, and fans of that previous sound might be disappointed in this release.  There are also a larger number of more somber, serious songs on this album, and those who wanted more of the light-hearted stuff from her earlier efforts are also going to be turned off by this album (it's as though thematically, she has shifted from mindless partying songs to songs that reflect the more mature idea of living in the moment, and the occasional bittersweet feelings of losing those times).  I still enjoyed it regardless.  If you're not sure, then give it a listen before buying to see if it's up you alley.  If you do decide to get it, I strongly recommend picking up the Deluxe version because all four included bonus songs are top-notch in quality, and definitely worth having.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Directions To See A Ghost with it's menacing, staggering, stumbling, Jim Morrison over tones, drenched in hypnotic intoxicating drones of heavy acid trip visuals, primal drumming, and garage guitar, all blend to create a bleary eyed fantasy of mind meets soul meets eye, and washes oceans of sound through your ears.  As persuasive as The Black Angels are on record, they are even more so live, and not to be missed on any account.  The Black Angels are a psychological rhythmic reason for stepping into the moonlight, downing a handful of psychedelics, and watching the pageant unfold before your very eyes.  Even the gated album and disc jackets are heavily embossed to visually and texturally trip you out.\n\nThere's a dynamic chemistry found here, created from low end vibrations, Jimmy Page hooks, and Middle Eastern influences that don't so much build in momentum ... rather they steadily carry you forward with an intoxicating obsession.  As dark and lustrious as this album is, it feels very warm, nuturing, inviting, and impressive ... at times startling, fuzzed out, and breathtaking.  But you see, I'm trying to describe an acid trip, or a head full of mushrooms, and that's just about impossible ... you're either on board and know exactly what I'm talking about, or you're at the station, ticket in hand, waiting on sixty tons of locomotive to pull up, drop the steps, punch your ticket, and take you for the ride of a lifetime.\n\nInteresting Note:  The Black Angels, like many others, have been heavily influenced by The Velvet Underground, copping their band name from The Velvet's track \"Black Angel's Death Song.\"  And as if that weren't enough, they drew the connection even tighter by naming their publishing company Death Song, thus completing the song title in full.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"\"Believe\" was one of those instant classic songs that defied modern trends by turning an early 80's dance theme into a late 90's monster hit. It's a powerful song and only the brilliant producer Junior Vasquez could produce such a hit. However, the remaining songs are a disappointment, showcasing Cher's amazing voice, but lacking originality. \"We All Sleep Alone\" is a pleasant soulful rendition that closes the CD, but the middle sounds like the filler that it is. However, only Cher could take ten songs to sell a huge album, just by her own tenacity and talent. Having the one gigantic hit doesn't hurt either. It's worth buying the album just for this song. If you really only want this song, the CD single has so many dance versions, it fills an entire CD.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Regarding the missing B-sides and whatnot - yes there is a bit missing but it is true with these compilations that you cannot please all. But I can play this entire collection without skipping songs and that is hard to do with most retrospective compilations. Along with true classics such as \"Sour Milk Sea\" (a needed track for Beatles complete collectors) - and a great introduction to Badfinger - one of the most underrated bands ever - there are some nice surprises - \"Thingumybob\" was an introduction to further McCartney experiments with the New Orleans sound in the 70's - I forgot how much Billy Preston added to \"My Sweet Lord\" - it really is the definitive version of a great song - and also includes \"That's the Way God Planned It\" - another decent song. \"God Save Us\" - a bizarre mix of Lennon protest with McCartney style vocals. \"Ain't That Cute\" by Doris Troy is a largely unknown gem. Aerosmith obviously used the Hot Chocolate Band cover of \"Give Peace a Chance\" as inspiration for their own version of not so long ago. And there are misses, but they are not fatal to the collection. \"King of Fuh\" has many fans who delight in the junior high school humor of the \"fuh king\" but the song is rather catchy with a piano line that you could imagine being played by Lennon. The oddly offbeat old school country song \"Saturday Nite Special\" doesn't really fly but again does not really bring down the set. It is interesting to listen to James Taylor's first \"Carolina In My Mind\" although he did improve on it later - I guess the only real miss is Ronnie Spector's \"Try Some Buy Some\" which George Harrison did re-record with only a little bit better success on his \"Living in the Material World\" LP. For those who complain about no Beatle songs (even solo Beatle songs) - you can pretty much find any Beatle solo work elsewhere but many of these tracks are only found here - there is a much more extensive Apple record box set available for the hard core collector (no pun intended). Overall though, anyone with an interest in the Beatle experiment at record label management will find this satisfying - you may be surprised to find yourself singing along with \"Govinda\" and George may be proud. Highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Mid-1970s black music seemed dominated either by fun, mindless party jams like \"Jungle Boogie\" and \"Skin Tight,\" or dour warnings like \"Future Shock\" and \"Living For The City.\" Stevie Wonder sang his share of life-affirming music but Earth, Wind & Fire, here with a definitive one-disc greatest hits, made such positive strength the heart of their musical identity.\nSome of the era's most needed, heeded messages ran deep and sweet atop Verdine White's bass grooves (front and center on \"Getaway\"), brother and leader Maurice's drum and percussion tracks  honed over years with Chess Records' rhythm section (\"Saturday Nite,\" \"Kalimba Story,\" 1977's dazzling \"Serpentine Fire\"), Louis Satterfield's horn section scrambling through jazz-rock mazes every track (becoming a 80s rock stalwart backing Phil Collins), and Phillip Bailey's high, clear falsetto on \"After The Love Has Gone,\" the prom dance standard \"Reasons,\" the soaring chorus of \"September,\" and the elegant \"Fantasy\" which, with \"Serpentine Fire,\" gave R&B one of its best 1-2 LP opening tracks. (It's restored to album length here, with Larry Dunn's superb keyboard intros, after being edited on two previous best-ofs).\nMessages like \"You're a shining star...shining bright to see what you can truly be,\"  \"If you sing a song today, you will make a better way,\" \"Try to resist all the hurt that's all around ya...\" moved feet and hearts, misinterpreted by spiritual seekers and hedonists alike in the \"Me\" decade's last discofied days. The Whites understood disco's falsity: \"Morning deals a bad hand to a woman who has made too many bets,\" Maurice sings on 1979's galloping disco smash \"Boogie Wonderland,\" adding, \"You dance and shake the hurt.\" But by early 1982, needing a hit after a slow-selling double-LP the year before, EWF gave in to the dance grooves and party-down lyrics of \"Let's Groove,\" their last Top 5 hit.\nDespite a generous 18 tracks (and an excellent geneology of the group by Kevin Goins), longtime fans will miss \"In The Stone,\" \"Fall In Love With Me,\" \"Head To The Sky,\" \"Let Me Talk,\" and others. These are found on 1995's \"Eternal Dance\" box, the \"Elements of Love\" ballads collection, or two previous best-ofs. This \"Greatest Hits\" packs their best-known pop songs into an exceptionally sounding disc (thanks to Mark Wilder's remastering), providing an essential introduction to one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's most surprising, satisfying member groups.","classification":5,"fold":5}

A lot of people are dissing this album and say that it sucks bc he was doing heavy drugs at the time this came out and yes its true and you can tell from the quality of the jokes.  But they're are still some pretty funny bits on this cd, but if you have never heard mitch hedberg b4 i wouldnt start with this one, id try all together, that one is definitely the funniest one.  Mitch Hedberg died in march of 2005 from a drug overdose and this was his last album b4 he died so its an automatic classic, but definitely not his best effort.  But he will go down in history as one of the best one liner comedians of all time.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Soul singer Kem's third album \"Intimacy: Album III\" opens with the lilting Stevie Wonder-esque ballad \"When I'm loving you\" which sets the tone for much of the CDs 10 tracks; breezy Jazzy songs with superb instrumentation.\n\n\"Love never fails\" is a splendid falsetto-sung piano ballad, while \"Share my life\" is guitar-festooned. \"Human touch\" is a midtempo groove as is the quivering duet with Maurissa Rose \"If it's love\" which calls to mind Al Green.\n\n\"A mother's love\" is an almost hymnal piano ode to mothers showcasing his sonorous tenor vocals, with full instrumentation in the final minute and a half. \"You're on my mind\" is Marvin Gaye-style while closing \"Golden days\" is Jazzy with slightly askew beats and a fluid poetic recital by Jill Scott urging one on despite obstacles in life. \"You can do it\" she stresses.\n\nThe pace never rises above midtempo (nothing like \"I get lifted\" From \"Album II\" for example). This album is a warm and intimate experience.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Talk about a band that peaked early on in their career and has ever since then always strided to but have never been quite capable of reaching that same level of excellence, Englands Deep Purple are undoubtedly best known for their sixth studio album, 1972s Machine Head (which was home to epic singles ilke Highway Star, Smoke On The Water, and Space Truckin). But they have stuck in there, continuously grinding it out year after year, releasing one solid album after another every few years. And for that alone -- well, that, and the fact that they are one of the most influential things ever to happen to the hard rock genre -- they should be respected.\n\nBut Deep Purple are also still very much on todays radar because they are still excellent musicians. Yes, their sound has gotten a little dated and unsurprising over the years, but they are still highly capable of writing a great song that is filled with memorable guitar chops, steady bass, prominent, flowing keyboard lines, and infectious vocals. The bands nineteenth full-length, 2013s Now What?!, is, of course, no exception to this rule.\n\nCuts like the appropriately named opener, A Simple Song, practically scream vintage Deep Purple, as they find a lovely acoustic intro flowing into heavy territory with big riffs underneath Ozzy Osbourne-esque vocals before once again settling down into a melodic and docile outro. Weirdestan is an equally as hard-rocking follow-up number, this one with an assortment of simple, brutal (and ultra chunky and crunchy) power chords and piercing solos; as is Out Of Hand, which begins with an atmospheric (and nearly symphonic-sounding) intro followed by an explosion of big, downtuned guitar crunch and raucous grooves. And this all comes to its head when the number uncorks some jazzy, partially shredding and partially wailing guitar soloing.\n\nNothing really stands out about some of the songs, namely BodyLine. But whatever points the album loses by occasionally bogging down in those bland moments, it more than makes up for by surrounding it in Hell To Pay, a groovy, honky-tonk-tinged rawker with more excellent guitar solo flights, some catchy, big, anthemic, and shout-worthy choruses, and even some keyboard\/synth\/organ-sounding solos, and Above And Beyond, which opens on a purely metallic note, with a crashing drum and downtuned bass intro.\n\nThe album then explores its more melodic and sensitive side, dipping into power ballad territory, but does so without ever losing any of its central momentum or energy. The dreary and dreamy Blood From A Stone is primarily occupied by bluesy guitar lines and warmly clean crooning, although it is further highlighted by some jazzy piano breaks, too -- breaks that sound like they would be right at home on the last Jerry Lee Lewis record (!). And following this up comes An Uncommon Man, a terrifically ominous, foreboding, and ambient mood-enhancing piece that features soaring melodic leads, towering harmonic solos, and classical music-inspired keyboard runs (which come courtesy of synth-ace Don Airey). And it is all anchored by a crashing, cymbal-heavy drum beat.\n\nApres Vous is an again up-tempo and lively metal song, this one with prominent, beeping bass lines, Black Sabbath-y riffage, and some more excellently ripping solos. Then, following the mildly dark and very brooding balladry of All The Time In The World, comes an again hard, muscularly-riffed, and this time even somewhat doomy-sounding heavy rocker in Vincent Price to close out the album.\n\nSo, there you have it. Deep Purple are still extremely relevant, inspired, heavy, and all-around exceptional. Predictable? Maybe. But you would not have it any other way!","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"It sounds, at first, as though Vangelis were sitting in, but  the results of that are very nice indeed in my opinion.\n\nThis albums tracks sound like where Floyd might have gone had they not had a seemingly never-ending trip down Roger's Therapy Lane. That sounds offensive, I know, but I feel strongly that the split and the move away from the Waters Gloom, Doom and Despondency period was a *good* thing. That artistic vision had run its course an album and more before the hammer dropped. In my opinion.\n\nThere is stuff here identifiably from the \"Meddle\" period, the \"Dark Side\" period and the \"Wish You Were Here\" period. The riffs and motifs can be heard clear as a bell. But I like where they go.\n\nIf you feel that Roger Waters was the heart, soul and creative force of the band you won't like this stuff. There are hardly any words and none of them dwell for a quarter of an hour on how awful everything is. You will also find the album sounds disgustingly like Floyd in the early to mid 70s even though they obviously have a stand-in bass player and are one genius short. It also puts lie to the slander that Wright couldn't play for toffee.\n\nIf, however, you aren't personally invested in the behind-the-scenes meltdowns, rants and ravings (from all sides) and prefer to get your music sans the extra \"insight\" provided by music journalists as to the creative process - or at least, relegate that sort of stuff to the sidelines where it belongs - you'll find much here to please the ear.\n\nThink of it as an album inspired by the ambiance of \"Echoes\".\n\nI haven't had a chance to view the blu-ray disc as I don't have a blu-ray player. *shrugs*\n\nThe packaging is neat too, with three large post-card inserts reminiscent of the stickers and posters given away with Dark Side of the Moon, one featuring a polarized plastic motion-picture effect that will help get those actually buying the album into the groove.\n\nThe booklet is a hard cover affair with track listings and pictures you can actually see without an electron microscope. Why it is almost like being back in the Vinyl Age, so multi-media is the experience (once upon a time the album art was more than just packaging and studying it while the music played was a pleasure I miss these days).\n\nAll in a sturdy box worthy of a Peter Gabriel artyfarty extravaganza. This box will survive the coming collapse of civilization that the one-star reviewers assure us will come as a result of this album being made and sold.\n\nWhich is good, because you'll want to be able to hear it again and again.","classification":4,"fold":5}

Yes, I did it purely for patriotic reasons. During the Nam War, my draft lottery number did not come up. Then I turned 26 and was married. At one time I mentioned to my wife that I was thinking about joining the Army for a while. She wanted no part of it. Well, then I had my chance. I served, after all, and I'm darn proud of it. I spent almost all of my time in Europe during the Cold War. We never knew when an alert would be just an exercise or the real thing. It was scary at times. Again, that's history. I love Toby's song.

{"text":"This is really cool stuff!  The 22 tracks, done in classical orchestra backing with the electronica of Daft Punk give a powerful fullness to the music, somewhat similar to the volumous magic of the Star Wars instrumentation and effect, only better!  It gives you a feeling of magnitude, as if you were sometimes floating in space, looking down on planet Earth.  The synthesization is magnificent.  It is a futuristic-type score that is often heart-thumping and driving.\n\nAs much as I love music, I was so \"into\" the movie when I saw it in the theater, I was not even consciously aware of the music.  Now that I listen to it separately, I wonder why not.  Obviously, the music and film were perfectly blended.  In other words, I was affected by the music without even realizing it.\n\nThis is not party music, but something you would play while you are either consciously relaxing and listening to it, or going about your business in the house (cleaning, in your workshop, whatever).  Sometimes it's slow and spacey; sometimes it is driving and thumping. The booming base is awesome.  If you play it in the car, don't blame me if you get a speeding ticket!  It makes you feel kind of invincible--and it makes you want to watch the movie again!\n\nBTW, the CD looks like the disc they wear in the movie, and the album cover looks like it lights up!","classification":5,"fold":5}

The remastering is no lie on this version as the sound quality is excellent although I still question the need for the bonus tracks which end up detracting from the overall enjoyment of the cd.  Perhaps I could live with the 3 live tracks as they give us a glimpse of what the band was like live but do we really need 2 session takes of \"The Heart of Rock and Roll\" and \"Walking On a Thin Line?\"  The powers that be should really make some effort in future releases to ensure that the bonus tracks are there for a reason and actually add to the overall enjoyment of the cd instead of just being filler of cd space!\n\nThe mlps design also leaves much to be desired having been poorly assembled with poor quality thin cardboard that looks as if it will come apart soon when the glue gets old.  For good quality mlps design see the ones done for the Hall & Oates and The Band series as good examples.  This is a very pricey version though and while the excellent sound quality goes a long way to justify the price the inferior mlps design surely does not.  The insert with all the lyrics in English and Japanese and the inner sleeve that very faithfully replicates the vinyl version is a nice treat though.\n\nSound quality wise, the mlps versions of both this and \"Picture This\" their two best ever albums are vast improvements over any prior cd versions though and if you don't mind paying more for poor mlps design then this version of the classic album is for you.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Well, here we are with another Rob Zombie record that is just kinda \"there\". Rob Zombie hasn't released a worthwhile solo album in over a decade and every time I get my hopes up that he will make a comeback he just ends up disappointing. Rob said that this album was going to be \"heavy\" and do things \"they haven't done in awhile\". I can first and foremost tell you that what he said was a lie. This album sounds exactly like his past couple albums and this one in particular sounds worst with some of the most cringeworthy lyrics I've heard on a Rock record in a long time. The lead single gave this flaw away with the saying of it's title \"Well Everybody's F***ing In a UFO\" I mean, come on. That title sounds silly and filled with stupidity and that exactly how the song goes as well. I know Rob has always had \"weird\" titles and strange lyrical themes in his music. Trust me, as a long time fan of Rob Zombie (especially White Zombie) I know. But this album is too far off to be taken seriously. So many of the songs sound like parodies of something else than serious songs. Only positive thing I can say about this album is its guitar tone sounds pretty cool at certain points. Other than that, this album is very passable.","classification":2,"fold":5}

{"text":"One can only imagine what Michael Jackson, from his childhood into his adult life, feels and felt at times in his life that ultimately turned into an unexpected odyssey. So much negative was written about the man, it is often too difficult to find a common middle ground among those who favor him versus those who do not mind repeating what seems to be the most popular. Leave Me Alone announces clearly that Mike HEARD it all, evening the references to him and The Elephant Man, which he shows in the video. His expression, through both music and his words, never seem to bring what he wanted the most: peace and\/or acceptance. The Glove started as the result of his vitiligo and that experience, clearly marked what most call abnormal, and he felt the same. Who wants to feel less than, even if others do not say the same? I can recall being teased as a child, from, \"He wears mascara!\" because of my long eyelashes, or, \"He has eyes like Tweetie Bird.\" I got dogged openly, in front of the girls I so wanted to notice me. But for every, and I mean EV-ERY person that ever teased me, including the girls I liked but who only thought, \"Oooh, he's so cute;\" as Biz Markie said, \"They caught the Vapors!\" So the big eyed, mascara wearing male grew up into those eyes and lashes and while those childhood taunts are more whispers now, it is quite easy to identify with at least a part of what makes Michael tick, tock. Perhaps not on the worldwide scale that he knows, but insecurity is insecurity, even if it is witnessed secretly. Leave Me Alone is the theme song for so many of us at various points in our existence, and our lives do not need a camera for an audience: the audience is always there in our minds. Michael unfortunately became the poster child for Ridicule, and it is awful such a powerful song was born out of pain and not pleasure.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Perhaps if I had not heard so many of these wonderful songs sung by so many wonderful singers in the past, perhaps if I had not expected so much from this release,  Now don't get me wrong I love to hear Josh sing, no voice like his, he could sing the phone book and I would love it.  I looked forward to this CD for a long time and it had the potential to be a once in a lifetime release but, for some reason for me things just don't quite gel.  Beautiful songs plus a beautiful voice, how can it go wrong. Can I go through my thoughts?  First, yes these are Broadway songs but Josh you are not on Broadway you are in a recording studio we can hear you just fine, even your softest whisper, so why so loud?  Secondly, the arrangements are not for these songs.  Yes they are full and nice on their own but not for you and not for these songs.  Third, its wonderful you choose so many wonderful songs.  My favorites are Try To Remember, there are gems out there just wanting to be brought back into the light so they can shine once more, this is one of those songs, beautiful.  Also,  If I Loved You, my favorite duet on the CD, although Kelly Clarkston surprised me.  Over The Rainbow,  It is nice to hear the long forgotten second verse but not your cup of tea.  Pure Imagination is not worthy of you, although I can see why you start the cd with it.  Josh, don't take yourself too serious, you can sing perfectly and true but if the heart is not in it, its a waste of time.  This CD sounds like you are trying too hard when you don't have to.  We loved you from the get go. Your last cd was my favorite, you sounded like you were free and having fun, this cd sounds like you felt to much pressure to make it great when you didn't need to try so hard.

{"text":"I really don't want to be \"that fan\" when reviewing this.  I respect the rights of an artist to evolve their craft, to experiment and try new things, and in general do what they want with their works.  And I don't want to be one of those fans who whines and gripes whenever an artist decides to try out a new genre or a new style.  A fan shouldn't dictate what an artist does, and it annoys me when fans of a work start complaining \"he changed it, it sucks!\" or \"it's popular, now it sucks!\" or \"<insert name here> has sold out and gone commercial!\"  I have long tried to avoid falling into that trap with my favorite writers, filmmakers, musicians, and the like.\n\nHowever... I have to confess that I find myself falling into those complaints here.  I love Owl City so much... but this latest album is a letdown, and yes, I will say that Adam Young's decision to shift his music style to be more in line with today's popular music is the main cause.\n\n\"Mobile Orchestra\" is something of a departure from Adam Young's usual style.  Instead of the dreamy electronic tunes with eccentric but charming lyrics I've come to love, this album has much more straightforward lyrics and more of a generic pop sound.  There's much more emphasis on percussion, and on using the synthesizer to create heavy, strong sounds instead of the whimsical and light sounds of his earlier albums.  And while Young is still the primary vocalist on about half the songs, the other half feature guest singers, including Aloe Blacc, Sarah Russell, Jake Owen, Britt Nichole, and boy band Hanson.\n\nCall me an old-school Owl City fan, but I loved Owl City's original sound -- it was unique and delightful, standing out from much of the more generic-sounding popular music.  And I find myself disappointed that Adam Young has altered his signature sound to match up to what's popular.  In a world where a lot of music sounds the same, it was nice to find a band and singer that stood out from the crowd yet didn't sound harsh or ugly, and Owl City fit the bill.  Now Owl City sounds virtually indistinguishable from countless other musical acts, and it saddens me.\n\nThat's not to say the entire album is for naught.  \"Verge\" is a fun and peppy song, and \"Unbelievable\" is one of the stronger songs on the album -- partly because its lyrics are a return to Owl City's original sense of surreal whimsy instead of blandly straightforward.  And as a Christian, I did enjoy the two Christian-oriented tracks on this album -- \"My Everything\" and \"You Are Not Alone.\"  Though Owl City isn't entirely a \"Christian rock\" musician, it's good to find a singer who isn't afraid to proclaim his faith through his music.\n\nMost of the rest of the songs are fairly weak, however, and largely unmemorable next to his earlier hits such as \"Vanilla Twilight,\" \"Alligator Sky,\" \"Dreams Don't Turn to Dust,\" and his most popular single \"Fireflies.\"  It doesn't help that there are a lot of collaborations on this album, and as Adam Young's voice is soft and dreamy in nature, he tends to be overpowered by whoever he's singing a duet with.  And while the guest singers sound nice enough... I came here to hear Owl City, not a singer I've never even heard of until now.\n\nI love Owl City, but this album was disappointing.  I'd recommend that fans of Owl City stick with his older albums \"Ocean Eyes\" and \"All Things Bright and Beautiful.\"  (\"Midsummer Station\" is lovely enough but shows some ominous signs of things to come...)  As for individual numbers on this album, I'd stick with downloading \"Verge\" and \"Unbelievable.\"","classification":2,"fold":5}

{"text":"I have most of these songs on MP3 but I wanted them on CD also. I want to be able to listen to the soundtrack by itself whenever I want.  Whats nice about the CD, the songs relate to episodes from the Empire series but if you have never seen the show you can still enjoy the music. I like the fact that I can listen to Rap songs that don't have the profanity and theres no reference to killing or selling drugs. I don't care that the Rap isn't hardcore. I grew up poor in a single parent household, my sister and I had to fend for ourselves while our mother was working to provide for us. I refuse to let this define who I am and Im not going to live my life with an attitude because of it. It is a reference point, its the dysfunction I was born into and the dysfunction Ive tried to remove from my life. I can also relate to the message in the songs especially the ones by Jussie Smollett. A lot of Jussies songs are about his character Jamals journey to self awareness and acceptance. These songs describe my journey also, all my life Ive been told I wasn't GOOD ENOUGH because my situation didn't fit into the rigid cookie cutter mold that is considered wholesome and normal.  I make NO APOLOGIES for who or what I am. That which I am is that which is SO BEAUTIFUL. I say yes to life, I embrace life and I LIVE LIFE IN THE MOMENT. I have the spirit and will of a Falcon; I have the spirit of a CONQUEROR. This CD like the Empire series is quality entertainment and if you remove the layers there is a powerful message in both.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":5}

What about Take Me Out-Paralyzer? The point is, not a big deal.\n\nSo anyways, the song has a nice buildup. It is a little slow, and the payoff may be less than satisfying, but Linkin Park is clearly going for a soft rock sound, to go in some background somewhere. Some people may like the sound, like soft rock fans, but fans of Linkin park will be like, WTH? \"In The End\" this is not. The vocals suit the song, the lyrics are good. Are they trying to go for a love song or something?\n\nOverall, try first, maybe buy if you like. For me, it's just another song on radio I could really care less about. And definitely not one you want to hear all the time. Maybe every once in a while, but that's it.","classification":4,"fold":5}

I also own and love his \"Last Supper\" disc, but this one is kind of a best of Jim, and comes with a DVD as well, so it's a no-brainer. Another hysterical combo is the last disc from Mitch Hedberg.

{"text":"British singer Dido arrived on the scene in 1999 with her debut \"No Angel\". Her album was produced by her brother\/labelmate at Arista Records- Rollo of the electronic band Faithless. Though the album was well received by critics, it took a while before the first couple of singles caught on. Fast forward over a year later, when she received exposure by way of Eminem- who sampled her song \"Thank You\" in his seven minute opus about an obsessed fan \"Stan\". From there Arista released \"Thank You\" as a single, which brought the public's attention to the singer. Fast forward three years later, she worked with her brother again on her second album \"Life For Rent\". While the recording was successful in her native homeland, it was a minor success in the United States. Most of that had to do with the corporate structure behind the scenes at her label. Five years had passed by the time she released her next album- the Jon Brion produced \"Safe Trip Home\". She laid low for five more years and released her fourth album on her new label RCA Records \"Girl Who Got Away\".\n\nHer new album marks a return to her electronica roots. After a ten year separation, she is reunited with her producer Rollo. Sonically, \"Girl Who Got Away\" picks up where \"No Angel\" left off. On the opening track \"No Freedom\", she muses over a pending breakup. She desires to live life to the fullest and takes chances on the title track \"Girl Who Got Away\". For the second time in her career, she works with a rapper- this time around it's California rapper Kendrick Lamar on the song about hitting a rocky patch in a relationship \"Let Us Move On\". On the song \"Blackbird\", she rides a rhythm that's probably the most uptempo song she's recorded. She deals with a nasty breakup on \"End Of Night\" and desires a place of solitude on the acoustic ballad \"Sitting on The Roof Of The World\". She expresses her thoughts on her feelings on \"Go Dreaming\" and closes the album with the ballad \"Day Before We Went To War\". While \"Girl Who Got Away\" is a welcomed return for Dido, one would get the feeling that she's playing it safe this time around. Despite the production being noticeably subdued, it's still a strong album from the underrated singer.","classification":4,"fold":5}

After listening to UNDER RUG SWEPT, I can honestly say it was worth the wait. The album opens with a hard rock type song in \"21 Things I Want In A Lover\", where Alanis lists what she describes as qualities, not neccesarily needs, that she wants in a lover. A surefire hit if released as a single I think. Everyone knows the opening single \"Hands Clean\", which is a great song to introduce the public to the album with. \"So Unsexy\" is another great song, which rightfully deserves to be a single. Other highlights include the songs \"Surrendering\", \"Utopia\", \"Flinch\", and \"A Man\". This is definately one of her best albums, and worth a listen or two. You can listen from start to finish without skipping any tracks, that right there tells you this is a good cd. So get UNDER RUG SWEPT, and enjoy the music!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I first heard of Swell Season three years ago when I went to a Damien Rice concert. Swell Season was the opening act and I had never heard of them. I was blown away. Glen Hansard is a fantastic singer and a masterful storyteller during his live shows. That night, I bought their first CD. I was impressed with nearly every track and I went out and bought a CD from Hansard's other band, The Frames.\n\nThen a few months later, I saw that Hansard and Marketa were appearing in a film together called Once, which features  a great deal of music from that Swell Season CD. I was overjoyed to see the band would then go on to win an Oscar.\n\nSo is there a sophomore slump or hangover with Strict Joy, the duo's second CD? Not at all. It is excellent. Every track is great and I was impressed that most of the music is softer than what Hansard has done with The Frames. It's a different side to him that should be explored more, I think, in future projects. As for Marketa, she is great but I prefer listening to his voice. Either way, this album is worth investigating if you like folk, or indie music.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that this CD was included in NPR's 50 best all songs considered collection for 2009.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"After the multiplatinum success of \"Acoustic Soul\", India. Arie comes back (mighty fast, I must add) with her followup \"Voyage To India\". The concocted mask the lady wears wears a bit thin on \"Voyage\" as this album is severely so-so.\nFirst off the production is weaker than on \"Acoustic\" and the lyrics are EXTREMELY clique (written in a pseduo-boho\/ I-love-my-self stance).The songs don't do much for the listener either.\nTired duds like \"Little Things\" and the predictably titled \"God Is Love\" are predictable and shallow attempts to pass for \"deep\" when they come off like Hallmark card messages.\nBland \"folk\"-flavored contemporary R&B follow and lead \"Voyage\" on it's meandering direction. It wouldn't too bad, I suppose, if the songs didn't come off so pre-programmed for an audience. \"Good Man\" is a 'free-spirited' urban radio morsel with second-rate Inyala Vanzant-esque writing. As with a majority of this record.\nFortunately, \"Voyage\" doesn't completely make you fall asleep with dribble. \"The Truth\" wins with some simple-yet-airy guitar parts and a slick but sincere beat but it's second-rate lyrics just make our girl stumble. \"Headed In The Right Direction\" is a wee-bit corny but has a slight Latin-influenced folk flavor and it stands out because Arie actually goes for something different instead of tired \"love yourself\" retreads.\n\nLook, \"Voyage To India\" makes India to be more of a \"Black-girl\" version of bland, \"folk\" pop songbird Jewel than Miss Chapman or Lauryn Hill. And it's need to be said that just because a Black woman's not talking about being \"bootylicious\" or partying or \"her man\" and plays an instrument that doesn't make her deep. India's image is way too formatted and manufactured. Her songs on \"Voyage\" aren't  as introspective or enlighting as she may have intended them to be but rather boring and painfully cliqued most of the time. Not \"deep\".\nIndia. Arie is very talented and deserves to write herself some better songs and challenge both herself and her 'audience'. She COULD be on the same level as a Tracy or a Lauryn but the  bland R&B that dominates this album doesn't do much for both the listener or her.","classification":2,"fold":5}

{"text":"Maroon 5's debut 'Songs About Jane' was lauded as an inspired, cohesive album by a talented new band with a fresh sound. But as with all bands, there was an inevitable evolution much to the chagrin of Day 1 fans. Slight personnel changes and the need for a band to redefine itself resulted with albums that felt somewhat unfocused and random with great songs sprinkled in every now and then. But on 'V', Maroon 5 seems to have found its footing and turns out to be my favorite M5 album. My favorites (for now) are as follows:\n\n~\"Animals\" - A tight head-bopper with a carnal rhythm at its foundation, Adam's animalistic instinct drives him to pursue his prey with conviction.\n\n~\"Sugar\" - There is just something about this song that I can't get enough of....sexy lyrics, the playful falsetto...ugh...my compadres don't get it...to each his own I guess.\n\n~\"Unkiss\" - Sometimes heartbreak is so painful that you wish a relationship could be undone. This is of my favorite woeful ballads in recent memory.\n\n~\"My Heart Is Open\" - A timeless classic that sounds like a throwback to stadium ballads of the 80s. Gwen complements Adam's vocals perfectly.\n\n~\"New Love\" - M5 has always been good with urban\/pop hybrids and \"New Love\" is no exception. It's the reason the band has such a broad fan base.\n\nWhen Maroon 5 first hit the scene, I thought they would venture off into an edgier sound, more rock (e.g. \"Harder To Breathe\", \"Not Coming Home\") and less radio-friendly. However, the band finds itself in a blissful pop arena, and it actually suits them well. 'V' gets five stars.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Lucinda Williams is in my opinion one of the most overlooked musicians in our era, considering that it's taken way too many years for her to get critical and some commercial acclaim, starting with 1998's \"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road\". The current decade has found Williams to be very productive, with 2001's \"Essence\" and 2003's \"World Without Tears\" studio albums and one live album. Now comes the new studio album.\n\nOn \"West\" (13 tracks, 69 min.), Lucinda Williams sings about her usual topics of relationships, loss, loneliness, heartache. She also confronts the death of her mother (\"Mama You Sweet\" and \"Fancy Funeral\"). The opener \"Are You Alright\" sets the tone for the album: a slow-tempo, aching song in which she wonders what has become of an old flame. There are not many up-tempo songs on here, which may bother some people, but it doesn't bother me as in the end this is a mood album. Highlights for me include \"Unsuffer Me\", which is the best song on this album; the bitter yet funny \"Come On\"; the epic 9+ Min. \"Wrap My Head Around That\"; the sweet \"Words\"; and the title track, which closes the album. The CD I bought came also with a 2 song (11 min.) bonus CD, which brings demo versions of \"Where Is My Love\" and \"Rescue\". Nice, but not really essential.\n\nIn all, I have come to like this album more with every listen. This is certainly not the most accessible Lucinda Williams, nor her best (that would still be \"Car Wheels\"), but this is a rich album in every sense. But it's not for anyone in a hurry. I saw Lucinda Williams live on her \"World Without Tears\" tour, and was blown away by her stage presence. I can't wait to see how the songs from \"West\" will translate in a live session.","classification":4,"fold":5}

Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you payed for it, its all leagle, and it's yours, for like EVER. :D And (like I said above) if you loose internet connection you can retry the download unlike iTunes :D\nIn my own PERSONAL opinion I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND you download songs, and buy songs from Amazon.com verses buying it on iTunes. c:","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I purchased this terrific album because I wanted to see if Cher could possibly sound any better.  And you know what, she's topped (ha!) herself again.  The American version of Cher's \"Living Proof\" contains quite a few danceable little ditties and a lot of smooth production.  It also contains Cher's curious choice of song lyrics (she only wrote one of the songs) and her somewhat annoying singing voice (only topped (again! haha!!) by her annoying speaking voice and the insipid things she says).  The problem with that particular album is she sings in a language Hoppy can understand (English!).  This Japanese version is much much better.  I can't understand a thing the crone is saying, but I can still dance dance dance my pants off!  For those who love Cher's new dance beat, but don't like listening to her silly platitudes, this is the choice for you.  Well worth the extra expense.

Adam Topol is such a talented drummer. He shines on the song \"From The Clouds\". This song is a three minute party. \"Only The Ocean\" is a such a peaceful song. \"The Upsetter\" is a song about trying to achieve inner peace. It has a funky sound to it. \"Turn Your Love\" is such a pretty song. This song is very relaxing. \"No Good With Faces\" is another song with the harmonica playing.  This song is about trying to find direction in life.  I can relate to the lyrics of this song being bad remembering faces and names myself.  The title track is a song about how the sea can be a source of serenity.  Jack rocks on the guitar on this tune.  Every track on this disc sounds unique.

{"text":"3.5 stars\n\nEisley's debut L.P. \"Room Noises\" is a perfectly good debut record. There is more potential for greatness on this record then I have heard in some time from any band, if they only reach it occasionally.\n\n\"Memories\", the records lead off track, is the records best ssong, all minor key harmonies and a twisting, melodic as all else breakdown which is one of the coolest things I have heard this year. The next song \"Telescopic Eyes\" is another keeper, showcasing the bands darker form of melodic pop, catchy enough for radio but different enough for the rest of us.\n\nFrom there the record is spotty. Or actually it's not. There really isn't a quote-unquote bad song on the record, it just gets a bit same soundy as it goes on. The group shows such potential and talent on the first handful of tunes that as the record goes on and the song remains the same you get kind of dissapointed. Maybe some changes in tone, maybe a little, just a little distortion, maybe some different types of arrangements could fix this problem. I don't know.\n\nBut I say buy this record. It is good, and this band could very easily be great a record or two from now. \"Room Noises\" is promising, even if it doesn't deliver fully on said potential. But I'll tell you one thing:\n\nI can't wait to hear what they do next.","classification":3,"fold":5}

Coming out of the sacred steel music tradition of the House of God Church, Randolph knows how to whip up a gospel frenzy. His pedal steel swoops through the entire album and drives the jams of his extended band. This is high-energy, positive music delivered with a high level of musicianship. It all goes by a little too fast and furious at times, but it is infectious.\n\nMake no mistake. This is a Christian album, or at least a spiritual one. The lyrics may sound like love songs, but believers will catch the cues. If you miss the point, Randolph makes sure to name-check God in the final song.

{"text":"Jan Hammer muses that the first seven days of creation may have in fact spanned a century of our time. If that's true then\n\nthe music on this album makes perfect sense. Basically this is\n\na record of instrumental keyboard interpretations of the first\n\ncycles of life on Earth,all the way to \"The Seventh Day\",a warm\n\npiano driven tune. One thing that must be considered though is that these songs have no bottom-everything lies on top and each\n\ncomposition takes time to develope,but once numbers like\n\n\"Darkness\/Earth in Search Of A Sun\" and \"Light\/Sun\" really get\n\ngoing Jan's minimoog kicks in and things get REALLY busy as they did on later Jan Hammer Group albums like 'Oh Yeah?'.\n\n  \"The Animals\" actually has a very tropical funk sound and is the closest thing the record ever has to a tempo.\n\nBut from beginning to end 'The First Seven Days' never remotely\n\napproches being a funky record,or poppy at all! Jazz plays a part in it but so do elements of world and modern electronic\n\nmusic. Jan Hammer mentions in the liner notes the expansive\n\nnature of music during the mid 1970's and this does seem to be\n\nmade with the intention to form a whole new type of music,just as bands like Blood,Sweat & Tears tried to do eight years earlier. Even if that seems like padding this has to be one of\n\nthe most challanging and rewarding fusion recordings ever made\n\nand because of it's relentless minimalism it's aged alot better then much of it's genre!","classification":5,"fold":5}

With Genesis he showed he was a amazing drummer, and stepped out to the lead vocalist, after Peter Gabriel's departure. But on his own, he had made a path that took him to the stratosphere and he made some of the most intimate and everlasting songs that ever was released since the 80's. After his solo breakthrough with the dominant Face Value, it has been hard to see him follow it up. Well, he had Hello, I Must Be Going, and some songs that were good, but not as good as the tracks from Face Value. I Don't Care Anymore is one of those underrated tracks from Phil's legacy, that showed a dark side into his solo work, and a hard hit with his fans. While it still is a good song, it is underrated compared to In The Air Tonight. But he still delivered a noble punch. If you're new to Phil Collins music, this would be one good download, but download the tracks from Face Value first, and than compare it with this song.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":5}

Once that happens you might want to check out some better recordings (Peter Schmalfuss, for one, really doesn't get this music at all. Noriko Ogawa isn't bad.)\n\nFor the piano music I would recommend the Walter Gieseking recordings, which are old and scratchy but magical, and the Paul Jacobs recordings, which are to me the best modern recordings - just stunning.  There are many fine recordings. One that springs to mind is a live Horowitz recording of L'Isle Joyeuse, which is very exciting.  Ivan Moravec is also a great Debussy player - and his recordings are available in decent sound.\n\nFor the orchestral works the Boulez recordings with Cleveland (both the older releases on Columbia\/Sony and the later DGG recordings) offer great detail and balance.  There's a beautiful new recording by Nezet-Seguin\/Montreal of La Mer that I have on SACD and recommend highly. Karajan did a couple of spectacular Debussy recordings on DGG.\n\nYou must have a recording of the great Debussy string quartet. It's frequently paired with the amazing Ravel quartet, which is also a must.  I have never found a recording of this piece that entirely satisfies me.  I've heard some great performances of it in concert.  But certainly there are many worthwhile recordings.  I wish the wonderful Chiara String Quartet would record it.  After all this time I don't think anyone has really gotten to the depths of this work in a recording and the Chiara Quartet seem to specialize in going deep.","classification":3,"fold":5}

You've heard about Christmas trees, Christmas presents, Christmas breakups, Christmas chaos, and in fact, you've heard just about everything, until now. A charity single, and Rob Thomas' first solo work (a whole lot better than most of his later stuff), this song sings a hymn for peace and goodwill toward men, that's not up in your face, unlike Mr. Lennon, and also unlike Lennon, there's no anti-war message! Nope, this song is a sincere piece of work, and one of Thomas' best. And unlike his later work, it builds toward something grand, and when it comes to the chorus, it soars in a magical fashion that can only happen at Christmas.\n\nOverall, one of the best modern Christmas songs I've ever heard.

{"text":"This is one of the best metal albums ever! I think most would agree that Master Of Puppets is better and I think I go against most people when I say that I prefer Kill Em All, but still this is fantastic.\nAfter releasing the killer (and at the time - original) debut, Metallica they release an even better album! Fight Fire With Fire sounds a bit cliched today with the quiet intro but it is one excellent song. Ride The Lightning is another great song and For Whom The Bell Tolls is quite sludgy and very good. They don't make riffs like that anymore! Then comes one of the best Metallica songs ever: Fade To Black. This is a quieter song which builds up progressively and is excellent. Trapped Under Ice and Escape are not so good but are listenable and they don't have me reaching for the skip button. Creeping Death is another excellent Metallica song and along with Fade To Black is one of the albums highlights. Then comes The Call Of The Ktulu. This is probably THE best metal instrumental I've ever heard! And to think that Lars was the only member of the band who was over 20 at the time - you won't find musical maturity like that in most bands - never mind that young - and certainly no nu-metal band will have it today.\nThis belongs in any true Metalheads collection - there aren't many albums that are better than this.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"------------------------------------------------------------\nAaron Lewis\n\"The Road\"\n(Blaster Records\/Warner Nashville, 2012)\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is commercial country with an admirable amount of twang. A rocker from the alt-metal band, Staind, singer Aaron Lewis \"went country\" a couple of years ago and signed with producer James Stroud's short-lived Stroudavarious label. He's still working with Stroud on this solid set of chunky neo-trad twang -- it's not quite in Dwight Yoakam or Alan Jackson, but maybe more like Montgomery Gentry or Tracy Lawrence in their rootsier moments. Still, it's a welcome change of pace from the usual high-tech Nashville pop of today. Lewis adds robust vocals and writes almost all the songs... This is commercial country, but with some grit - worth checking out if you're looking for mainstream stuff with a little edge.

{"text":"In Out of the Wasteland, the band Lifehouse takes direct aim at contemporary American culture and pathos and delivers a sound that is surprisingly real, current, and can one say gritty without being anachronistic.  With titles like One for the Pain, Runaways, Firing Squad, and Hurt this Way, the album is not exactly milk and cookies on a Saturday night and yet the overall sound has more to do with honey than vinegar.  It is the flavor of a film by Tennessee Williams, poignant, emotional, slightly dysfunctional but always reeling with hope and a free-wheeling desire.  It is a uniquely American sound, feeling, and vibe being gloomy yet optimistic, tame yet wild, honest yet a false projection of a land that has struggled with all kinds of evils and shortcomings.  There is no better band than Lifehouse to take the triumph and tragedy of the American experience and translate it into music that is, if not epic, at least enjoyable and resonates with our better angels.","classification":5,"fold":5}
{"text":"I finally decided to add 'The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0' set to my collection, and it's almost perfect. Unlike the original release, this one comes in a digipak fold out case, which hold the 3 CDs in slits and can be a problem if you handle them often, so plan on uploading the music to iTunes (etc) to avoid scratching your discs. The digipak case unfolds to reveal cool photos of Michael, and you also get a nice booklet that provides more photos, plus complete details (chart info, etc) for each song. As for the music, this collection does a nice job representing BOTH the Motown & Epic years for Michael (and his Brothers on Disc 1). The first 2 CDs are jam packed with a total of 38 songs, many of which are featured as 'single edits', which is fine as I already have the full versions. The Bonus 3rd Disc is a nice treat, but could've been perfect if 'I'll Be There', 'Dancing Machine', and 'Scream' (Duet with Janet) were included. It does however feature Michael's #1 duet with Paul McCartney ('Say, Say, Say'), which has never appeared on a Jackson CD until now. At any rate, I recommend this affordable 3 CD set to fans who want a better Michael Jackson collection than 'Number Ones' or aren't ready to purchase the 'Ultimate Collection' (which also failed to include a number of classics!).","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I am by no means a fan of Alanis Morissette. Her voice sometimes annoys me. Lyrically her songs comes off a bit contrived and lacking any bite or edge that artists such as Ani Difranco and Tori Amos consistently churn out with each album. What compelled me to buy \"Under Rug Swept\" was not the single \"Hands Clean\" but rather the plaintive acoustic ballad \"Utopia\". I just fell in love with the song. When I heard \"Surrendering\" on MTV2 over the past weekend, my curiousity was piqued even more. I decided right then and there that I would have to buy \"Under Rug Swept\" regardless of my thoughts on Alanis as an artist. Now that I have heard the entire album. The good news is that I can't say that I regret buying the cd because there are some excellent songs. The bad news is that the first two songs are just hideous for me to listen to. I just hate Alanis' screeching vocals on \"Narcissus\", and \"21 Things I Want In a Lover\" just came off sounding stupid lyrically. I have to skip those two tracks. \"Hands Clean\" isn't too bad. It is starting to grow on me but it certainly isn't one of my favorite tracks on this album. The material starts getting stronger and better right after \"Hands Clean\" I think, particularly starting with \"So Sexy\". The lyrics were a bit off-putting for me and came off somewhat cheesy but the melodies and the musicianship were great. \"Precious Illusions\" is another favorite track of mine. This time the lyrics were good as were the hooks and melodies. I think Alanis sounds much better when she isn't singing off the top of her lungs and rather low-key (for her that is) like in songs such as \"That Particular Time\" and \"Utopia\". Those were my favorite moments. Unlike Natalie Imbruglia's \"White Lilies Island\", I still remain unconvinced regarding Alanis Morisette's talents. This album was so spotty in various places I still remained convinced that she is just a mediocre artist but it doesn't mean that I think she is terrible, just mediocre at best. Nevertheless she has gotten off on the right foot with this album for me. I just hope that she can do better material than \"21 Things I Want in a Lover\" and \"Narcissus\".","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"The magnificent Dead Or Alive kicks off this 1981 album on which Cale is assisted by Sturgis Nikides, Jim Goodwin, Peter Muny & Robert Medici. Alone worth the price of the album, this song paints a frightening scenario of the pornographic underground and is driven by the shimmering trumpet lines of John Gatchell. A live version with a significantly different texture appears on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Comes-Alive\/dp\/B001IJZ188\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Comes Alive<\/a>.\n\nFighter Pilot is another frenzied track where the Bomberettes provide frisky background vocals whilst Cale's voice & viola rule on Wilson Joliet with its multi-layered sonic patterns. Eerie & 'gothic,' Streets of Laredo is a slow brooding piece with strange percussive sound effects that wouldn't seem out-of-place in the collected works of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Edgar-Varse\/dp\/B00000AFR8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Edgar Varse<\/a>.

Normality returns with the mournful & melodious Riverbank that reaches a crescendo before fading out on enchanting instrumentation; it recalls the gentler side of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Wrong-Way-Up\/dp\/B000A3MHWG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wrong Way Up<\/a>, Cale's 1990 collaboration with Brian Eno.\n\nRussian Roulette rocks hard in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Slow-Dazzle\/dp\/B000006XD0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Slow Dazzle<\/a>&nbsp;manner and the album concludes with Magic & Lies, a striking blend of classical and rock that expires on the last gasps of shuddering drum patterns. Honi Soit is an uneven album and not amongst Cale's most accessible.

{"text":"April 1st, 2010 (2:09 AM)\n\n1. Still Standing - A pretty hot beat but starts out slow and quiet. The lyrics are good. Luda's verse is OK, but not completely necessary because it's short. Overall: 3.75 stars.\n\n2. One In A Lifetime - Flat out boring and not up to her standards. I don't like it much. Overall: 2.75 stars.\n\n3. Stay Or Go - You hear the chorus too much, but the beat more than makes up for it. Lyrics aren't bad, but it's the music that really hits you here. Another favorite. Produced by Bie Maejor. Overall: 3.75 stars.\n\n4. Everything To Me - Produced by Missy Elliott, written by her and newcomer Jazmine Sullivan, I'm afraid this is the best Monica can offer. Great lead single, nice vocals and perfect sample. If I'm proved wrong, I will definitely eat my words. Overall: 4 stars.\n\n5. If You Were My Man - Missy produced and has her vocals all over it like on 'So Gone'. Instead of being a throwback, production sounds dated. It's sorta catchy though. Overall: 3 stars.\n\n6. Mirror - If it had one more verse instead of so many choruses, this song would be better. Verses are surprisingly strong. Overall: 4 stars.\n\n7. Here I Am - The second and last track to be written by Monica on the main album (not counting the exclusive Amazon track, Lessons Learned). Not the most exciting track, but it's alright. Monica speaks about her man (or someone she's interested in) going out and maybe dancing with another girl. She says she's going to do her own thing and call her girls and get her own party on. Overall: 3.5 stars.\n\n8. Superman - By now, I'm noticing this CD is more laid-back than upbeat. Some may find that boring. Produced by Bryan-Michael Cox, this track is another love song. 3.5 stars.\n\n9. Love All Over Me - BY NOW, I realize she needed more upbeat tracks to accompany some of these slower tracks. Good vocals, decent, addicting beat and one of the better mid-tempos. 3.75 stars.\n\n10. Believing In Me - Produced by Stargate, this is another slow ballad. Kinda inspirational, but at least one of these tracks should have been another party anthem. I guess Monica's just in that place. Nice guitar outro. 3.75 stars.\n\n3.5 stars or a 7\/10 (not an average).\n\nDOWNLOAD:\n'Everything To Me'\n'Mirror' &\n'Love All Over Me'","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"As I write this review, Ke$ha's second full-length \"Warrior\" has been out almost exactly one year.  So many artists whose success breaks out almost overnight and like a firestorm on their debut, as was the case with Ke$ha in 2010, are sure to fizzle out considerably on subsequent releases.  Well, I am glad to report to you that this is most certainly not the case here!\n\nFar from being a sophomore slump of any kind, \"Warrior\" may be even better than its predecessor.  While there is nothing here that is quite the level of \"instant classic\" in terms of radio accessibility as was her breakout hit \"Tik Tok,\" overall \"Warrior\" is a step forward in other ways and a more mature, well-rounded album.  I think this has a lot to do with Ke$ha's lyrics being a little more meaningful and substantive on this one.  All told, there are still a fair amount of the type of lyrics about a free-spirited party lifestyle that we have come to know and love from her like \"I don't wanna go to sleep\/I want to stay up all night\/I don't want to think about what's going to be after this\/I want to just live right now\" (from \"C'mon\").  Phrases like these make Ke$ha's music the ideal party music.  I know I work second shift and I love listening to her CDs in the middle of the night until, well, \"when the sun's comin' up.\"  Her lyrics such as these assert a central and universal theme, of both how good it is to be young and how good it is to be alive.  Ke$ha's music is true to herself.  She doesn't water it down or make it all flowery and diluted like some mainstream pop stars do.  She is the real deal.  She can rap like she's from the streets to be sure, with even the occasional f-bomb thrown in here and there for good measure, and yet there is always that remnant present of her suburban Tennessee valley girl roots as well.  Ke$ha is an outcast at heart, almost like a hybrid of the Sex Pistols and electro dance pop.  I love how in my favorite track here, \"Wherever You Are,\" when she says, \"Love will never die,\" she says the word \"die\" with such a defiant sneer, not unlike Johnny Rotten before her.  Very convincing and distinctive.  Finally, perhaps the lyrics that stand out the most to me are in closer \"Love into the Light,\" where Ke$ha poses the question (to paraphrase her):  \"Can we all get over (our differences) and stop talking (garbage)\" about each other?  Something for all of us to consider, no doubt, and a superb way to end this excellent album.\n\nSo, if you can't already tell, I absolutely love this CD and Ke$ha, which is why I can't for the life of me fathom why \"Warrior,\" although it's been a modest success, has, even after a year, yet to achieve gold status sales-wise, unlike its multi-platinum predecessor.  I love both albums and own and will buy anything she ever puts out.  She is my favorite female artist to come along in years.  All in all, \"Warrior\" is a super successful sophomore outing.  The songs are catchy, fun to listen to, and life-affirming.  Highly recommended to any and all Ke$ha fans!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Wow!!! I first heard of Fireflight when I saw them in concert a couple years ago (Nov. 2008 to be exact) and loved them live. In fact, I got an autograph from them and a picture with them after the show. They were pretty nice, though they didn't say much. I imagine they were pretty tired though, seeing as they had just performed a short time earlier. After this I got their first 2 CD's, both of which are awesome by the way, and then when I heard that this one was coming out, I could not pass it up. I bought it and I love it. It is just as good as the first two in my opinion. One thing I actually liked better was that it had a little more variety, from hard rockers such as \"Desperate\" to the soft Piano tunes of \"Name.\" All in all a great CD. There is not a bad song here.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I haven't seen them live (unless seeing them perform on The Tonight Show counts), but this is the kind of music that begs to be heard live.  Care was clearly taken in giving a live feel to the recordings.  While this album is top loaded with barn burners (and none burn as firecely as \"S.O.B.\"), there are some terrific mellower songs like \"Wating Time\" and the aptly titled \"Mellow Out\" to prevent this from becoming a monotonous genre exercise.\nRateliff has a terrific voice for this material and the band has a lot of energy.  Perhaps a couple of songs could have benefited from more interesting arrangements, but this is a very fine debut from the Night Swats. Keep rock n roll alive!","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Amazing, after so many years without a new release Toad The Wet Sprocket still have the same ethereal, spiritual sound which takes you to a whole new universe! Glen Philips' voice still sounds as great as it used to, and the others provide great backup vocals. However, to an extent the music sounds a little bit more modern day, and not quite as dark or mortifying as some of their older work. The title track (and opener) sounds more like \"Absolutely Still\" by Better Than Ezra, the opener from THEIR most recent album \"Paper Empire\" - techno-like dance rock, meant to get your head banging and fists pumping. And \"I'll Bet On You\" is an emotional breakthrough, sounding almost U2-ish, with loud blaring electric guitar, fast-paced drums, and jovial lyrics. \"The Eye\" is the closest to their old songs that it gets, slightly more reflective and calm. But albeit with a slightly happier breath of fresh air than any of their older albums (and a much needed one at that), the album still proves the band for whom they are - thoughtful, philosophical, and everlasting Toad The Wet Sprocket.!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Considering she widdled down this cd from 40 tracks to 13, it makes me wonder what those other songs sound like.  And why put on \"And I'm Telling You\" which was already released???  What up with that?  She could of at least put on the club dance remix instead of the Dreamgirls version!  There are like 5 tracks i like off the entire cd.  I absolutely love \"Spotlight\".  It's a classic r and b song that will sound good forever.  \"If It Isn't Love\" is a good song.  It sounds borderline alternative with that new crossover sound but remains r and b in flavour.  \"My Heart\" is a good mid tempo sounding groove.  I do like the gospel song \"Jesus has A Place For Me Over There\", but I'm not crazy over any of the other ballads.  In my oppinion, all of the other slow songs are what ruin the album for me.  I don't like how jennifer Hudson disguises the song \"We Gon Fight\" as an inspirational, cutesy empowerment song when actually if you listen to the lyrics, it's a pro-war song and advocates violence.  I'm sorry I'm not a \"war\" person so I don't like the message of the song.  I like Culture Club's \"The War Song\" where it goes \"war war is stupid, and people are stupid....\"  Now that's a good message but i guess were not living in that kind of world anymore.  The song \"I Can't Stop The rain\" is a bizarre song about some horrible car crash, talking about how a car flips over 3 times and I wish you would have died instead of her?  What??  It's moments like this on the cd that put off the listener.  There is no flow to the whole thing.  It's another one of those mixed bag offerings where the artist is covering many creative grounds and trying to prove themselves.  I like Jennifer Hudson in spite of it all.  I think she has a genuine personality, and I like the fact she tries to appeal to a wide audience, especially her gay fans.  She has alot more in her and this is a good first effort.","classification":3,"fold":5}

My only complaint is that this collection omits the Top 20 hit \"I'm Coming Home.\" [It should have been included in place of \"How Could I Let You Get Away,\" which was the Spinners' debut single release on Atlantic, but was replaced by the b-side:  \"I'll Be Around.\"] While not as comprehensive as some other anthologies, this is a hit-packed collection of the Spinners' essential hits.

In the summer of 1967 Capitol records released an extraordinary recording of a tune she had written called \"Ode to Billie Joe\". The song was extremely controversial at the time.

I have always been a fan of Chrissie's, from the very beginning of the Pretenders first release back around 1979. I have every CD, Concert DVD, Video DVD, & Box Set released by all the various versions of the Pretenders. I even have a DVD of Chrissie & the Pretenders being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, near Chrissie's hometown of Akron, Ohio.\n\nI'm happy for Chrissie, that she has finally found her perfect lover, \"LUCKY JP\". I love Chrissie, but I'm a little jealous of that JP guy. Just like some of the other reviewers, I've always had a crush on Chrissie, but I also love her music and videos. This Deluxe Edition is one great package for a Chrissie Lover. The songs tell a tale about the love story between her and JP, and the struggles they had to overcome. It's a beautiful, real life issue, love story that ends with commitment & fidelity. The Deluxe Edition contains 2 bonus songs: \"Christmas Soon\" and \"Skinny Love\". The Bonus DVD contains videos for \"If You Let Me\", and \"The making of If You Let Me\".\n\nThis is a real treat, for any Pretenders &\/or Chrissie Hynde fan.

This was shortly after the height of the grunge era, and rock as a genre was trending heavily towards angst.

Although the formula of quiet\/loud had been done and done again by the time this song was released, the Pumpkins sold it convincingly here.  For some reason this track does not get old over the years, at least for me.  A true classic of the 90s and a fun listen despite the somewhat depressing subject matter.","classification":5,"fold":5}

How a station can be profitable by spinning the 40 newest rancid pieces of excrement I will never know. So it was to my surprise about six years ago when I finally heard somebody different: a unique voice singing intelligent lyrics with acoustic accompanyment. The first thing I thought was how did this get through the commercial radio filter system that strains out quality and lets only contaminated by-product through? The second thing was - who is this? It was Jewel of the Pieces of You era.\nFast forward five years. \"Intuition\" is on the radio. I can understand selling out if you are pushing 40, working temp office jobs for $9.00 an hour, and playing the coffee house circuit every weekend. But if you have made it big doing what you like to do, why do you sell out to the vacuous fads of today's fleeting pop scene? I guess once you get money, all you want is more money and you forget what the ultimate purpose of making music was. What a pity.","classification":1,"fold":5}

{"text":"I remember when I first bought \"Live At The Keystone\" on vinyl back in \"73\" or \"74\". I remember how Happy I was when I first dropped the needle on this puppy. I was literally like a \"Kid on Christmas Morning\"! (In fact, I bought this record as a gift to myself for Christmas). From the first note on I knew I was listening to something very special. Very Special Indeed! I was heavily into Garcia at the time (and still am). But as I was listening to these recordings, I quickly realized that none of that mattered. I knew I had come upon some of the best music I had ever heard in my life. These live recordings are just that good. In Fact they are-> \"Astonishlingly Good\". Please know that I do not throw that term out there very lightly, but in this case it is true. Now, finally, we can all enjoy the whole concerts the way they are meant to be heard. I will say this, even if you don't care for Garcia or Grateful Dead music in general this music is a completely different animal. If you are a fan of jazz, blues, funk, raggae, R&B or whatever, it is all here in it's finest form. Live, tight, natural and pure. It is simply, \"As Good As It Gets\" and the Remastered sound is Awesome! I highly recommend this music to anyone who has good taste in music. If you buy it great! You are one of the \"Keepers\". If you don't, you are definitely one of the \"Losers\". I would give this music a Thousand Stars if I could, instead of a lame five. IT IS THAT GOOD! The music speaks for itself-your ears will hear the quality. Thanks for reading my review and take my advice, I think you will be \"Very Satisfied\" with your purchase. - I promise. peace, zoom zoom.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"On their 10th studio album, this iconic Chicago band plays comfortably accessible Americana indie rock and, as always, they do it without ever being boring or predictable. The tunes are there, the country twang is there, Jeff Tweedys friendly pull-you-in voice is as strong as ever.  Wilco has become an old friend you can count on. Theyll always entertain you with something of substance, but theyll always surprise you, too. You never know when the melody will take a turn for some bizarre twist in the road, or the guitars will crank-up and seek a new way to rock.  Or maybe the song will slowly build to an explosive intensity, or just fade off into the desert sunset with a sweet pop hook.  However their music is presented, Wilco always seem to speak to the listener in a way the grows closer with each listen.  Its a gift.","classification":4,"fold":5}

This is actually a move he made on a number of occasions when his music and career seemed in question. Well right now his career isn't in that state at all. He's musically revered by many in this generation and was recently given a tribute on the BET Music Awards this past year. Prince himself also seems to obsessed with some strange form of eternal youth in which his music doesn't age but his lyrical themes mature.\n\nYou will not find any explicit lyrics on this album for sure,same as you won't find them on any of his albums since 2001. That doesn't mean that effects the music at all because these are the most energized,lively,funky and musically sophisticated songs Prince has done in the new millennium. The album opens and ends on the same basic musical note with \"Compassion\" and \"Everybody Loves Me\" embracing the shuffling LINN drum led rockabilly styled funk with lyrics that alternately speak of both selflessness and selfishness. \"Beginning Endlessly\",the amazing \"Sticky Like Glue\" and \"Lavaux\" all embrace the classic Prince all encompassing funk groove with some delicious synthesizer squiggles and layored drum and percussion tracks.\n\nHe hasn't lost his touch as a multi instrumentalist in the least bit and actually has expanded on it to include light rhythmic nods to both hip-hop\/R&B and contemporary 80's dance revival (itself based on his own original music) without shamelessly surrendering to either style and still being himself. Songs like \"Future Love Song\",\"Walk In The Sand\" and \"Sea Of Everything\" also embrace Prince's touch with the slow jam to it's absolute best effect. Typical of Prince he makes you flip through 75 separate 2-4 second empty tracks before we get to cut 77,which is the title song offered as a very hidden bonus selection. This is very much a TAFKAP era sounding funk\/rap styled number but still his one-man-band style is very much in attendence. After all these years Prince obviously has no intent on being a fossil. He wants to keep being himself and now that he's in his 50's he also refuses to musically look down on those younger than them and also embraces many of their ideas into his own.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Dave Davidson has become the most reliable artist in modern metal as Revocation continues to crank out great albums. Great Is Our Sin continues this trend as Dave and the boys rip it up on the newest offering. There is nothing all that different going here- still sounds like a Revocation album with lots of fast thrash\/death riffs and tight double bass drumming from new skinsman Ash Pearson. The middle tracks are where this album peaks with the rapid fire \"Communion\" , insane instrumental \"The Exaltation\" (featuring ex-Megadeth Marty Friedman), and the pummeling \"Profanum  Vulgus\".  As expected, the solos do not disappoint,  with Dave delivering all but three on the album. I will say that the song structures don't vary as much as they may have on previous works - not as many of the lush interludes or jazzy soloing escapades, but this focus does not detract from the songs or solos at all.  There is a bit of a left turn with \"Cleaving Giants of Ice\" - much slower and more mellow than usual with some clean Ghost - like gang vocals. Not my favorite track, but glad to see some variation in the proven Revocation formula. For the most part, this is very heavy and fast, and while there are some clean vocals, 95% of it is Dave screaming\/growling. Don't worry- they are not going soft by any means, which they prove by ending this superb slab of steaming metal with a Slayer cover!!! Like I said already, Dave Davidson is a huge artistic force in extreme\/tech\/thrash\/death\/prog\/whatever metal and I will continue to check out whatever he's serving up, and so should you!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Prime Cuts: Our Deliverer, In Jesus' Name, The One I Love\n\nThough Southern rock has always been the default template of Third Day, there's always discernable threads of worship music in their prodigious portfolio of songs.  And over their storied career where they have had received 28 chart topping singles and sold over 7 million records, Third Day's best moments are arguably encapsulated in their worship songs.  This is why their former worship albums, namely 2000's \"Offerings\" and 2003's \"Offerings II,\" are often regarded by avid fans as their catalog treasures.  12 years after \"Offerings II,\" Third Day are back with their third and most satisfying worship album to date.  Unlike their former two worship records which are more or less a pastiche of live tracks, new songs, formerly released songs, and covers slapdash together, \"Lead Me Home\" is a seamless affair of entirely studio recorded tracks freshly penned just for this disc.\n\nHands down, the \"wow\" factor of \"Lead Us Back\" is squarely centered on lead singer Mac Powell's charismatic vocals.  Take a listen to their single \"Our Deliverer.\"  With his bright booming voice that calls to mind Casting Crowns' Mark Hall, Powell brings an air of Godly confidence to \"Our Deliverer,\" an anthem of faith that awaits the second coming of Jesus Christ. Then hear Powell takes his vocals on a roller coaster ride with the hilly hymn-like \"He's Alive,\" a worship song that ought to make it into the repertoire of churches come Easter.  Powell who has had a couple of excursions in releasing his solo country albums certainly brings his rustic sound to bare on the folky \"Soul on Fire\" (co-written with Matt Maher) where All Sons and Daughters can be heard in the backing department.\n\nBut Third Day are not just interested in just making worship songs.  Songs like \"Spirit\" and \"Your Words\" have a sing-along quality reminiscent of many of Hillsongs' paeans that create invitations for congregation members to want to sing along.  This is particularly true of \"Spirit\" which has a choral backing tailored for church worship.  And the best amongst the congregational-focused song that is destined to be a classic is \"In Jesus' Name.\" Not a cover of Darlene Zschech's song of the same titular, \"In Jesus' Name\" is a transcendent power ballad that features the voices of Christian music's top artists such as Michael W. Smith, David Crowder, Natalie Grant, and Michael Tait.\n\nFans who yearn for a softer moment without the tight blast of guitars and drums will take delight in the album's final track \"The One I Love.\" This song simply is a testament of what a great vocalist Powell is.  Even with just his soaring vocals, a backing vocalist, and an acoustic guitar, he can still lead us into God's throne room with such grace and verve.  This track by itself speaks volumes of the passion Third Day puts into this record.  In sum, this truly is a well-invested album made specifically to lead us back to the woship of the King of kings.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I was a big fan of Brian Tyler's score for \"Iron Man 3\", so I was happy that he was continuing his collaboration with Marvel to work on \"Thor: The Dark World\". I also enjoyed Patrick Doyle's work on the original \"Thor\" film, and was looking forward to hearing what new music the sequel would bring. It seems that for \"The Dark World\", Tyler has produced a similar style and tone; although those who like continuity in film franchises might be a little disappointed, because I didn't hear any specific themes from the first film re-used here.\n\nThe music has a lot of great action cues that will add to the fun of those sequences in the movie - fortunately, the music is also great to listen to on its own. There are also some tracks that skillfully use vocals, the most memorable of which is \"Lockasenna\" [Track 2]. I always enjoy the use of choral elements in soundtracks, and it feels very appropriate here given the larger-than-life nature of this story about gods and other worlds.\n\nOverall, I think \"Thor: The Dark World\" is a great soundtrack that's surpasses the original \"Thor\" album - although both are definitely worth a listen. This is the second great score from Brian Tyler in 2013, and \"The Dark World\" is among the best scores for a Marvel Studios film to date.\n\nThe one other thing to mention is that this film is the first to feature just the Marvel Studios logo at the front (no Disney, Paramount, etc). As such, the logo has been expanded and Tyler was asked to create a full 30-second fanfare - this music is included on \"The Dark World\" album, and is likely to be heard at the beginning of every future Marvel Studios film.\n\nFavorite Tracks\n[1] Thor: The Dark World\n[2] Lockasenna\n[24] As the Hammer Falls","classification":5,"fold":5}

With its sparkling mixture\n  of high-rocking melodies, captivating songwriting, memorable moments and even\n  jubilant virtuosity, A Single Man is a personal and time-honoured classic that truly\n  deserves even greater recognition and equal billing in just the same way his best\n  albums do.  Highlighted by a sophisticated track set, the songs are showcased in\n  an array of creative merit and lyrical charm, which begin with the uplifting opening\n  track Shine On Through, which is proceeded by chart-topping hits such as I Dont\n  Care, Part-Time Love, the totally electrifying Shooting Star, Madness and the ins-\n  trumental Song For Guy, as well as other well-known hits including the jolly music\n  hall favourite Big Dipper, Return To Paradise and even Revere.  With lyricist Gary\n  Osborne sitting in for Bernie Taupin (who briefly left and returned two years later),\n  A Single Man provided Elton a change of pace and another shining achievement,\n  and despite the mixed reviews during that time, the albums success have gotten\n  better over the years.  Digitally-remastered in its complete expanded edition with\n  stunning grace and honour, you will also get five bonus tracks like Ego, Flinstone\n  Boy, Lovesick and Strangers, where they contribute to the albums classic status\n  that makes it sound 100% better and a timeless must!  Truly hailed as one of his\n  best and most beloved masterworks, you will definitely have yourself such a jolly\n  good time with this dashing tour de force from the keyboard maestro himself.","classification":5,"fold":5}

I never really thought about owning it until after Patrick Dempsey left the show and I heard a lot of people (okay, women, lol) say they were so sad whenever they heard Chasing Cars now because it reminded them of \"Derek\". I had a little light bulb moment like, hey, I should hop on Amazon and buy that song! Sometimes I forget how easy it is these days to just own a song you really like. What can I say? I was born in the 70's! We had to buy everything on cassette tape or try to catch the song on the radio and press Record at the right time! Honestly, this is so much easier! And now I have this song and I'm very happy about it, SCORE!!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"This goes way back to 1970. Conway always has been one of favorite country performers ever since he came up with 'It's Only Make Believe', back in 1957. I think he is one of the best. He did get many awards and recognitions. Even while he spent time with Uncle Sam (Far East) he would not cease to entertain. He formed a band and played for the troops. He was born in Mississippi but moved to Arkansas when he was only 10 years old. His actual name is Harold Jenkins. It was determined that he needed a stage name with more ring to it. At one time, he was looking at a road map where he saw at town called Conway in Arkansas and a town in Texas called Twitty. Hence, that was his name from thereon in. This particular song is one of my favorites. This is pure Conway. It is an iconic classic. I have always loved it. This is the actual original single version; the MP3 sound quality is excellent.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"I was thinking about the scene in the Oliver Stone film where Robby Krieger plays Light My Fire on  guitar for the rest of the group. Krieger wrote most of the song, including the first verse and chorus. Jim Morrison wrote the verse that contained wallow in the mire and love become a funeral pyre. This is according to The Doors FAQ book.\n\nThe song opens with the crack of a drum followed by some baroque-esque keyboard from Ray Manzarek. The lyrics are bookends for the vast instrumental middle section that begins at 1:07 and lasts until 5:42 (about 65% of the song).\n\nI like the little chord twist that happens after the second Come on baby light my fire, at 0:32. A relative of the piano chord change in Imagine. As far as the instrumental section goes, I enjoy the keyboard stuff but I am really into Robby's guitar. It comes in at 3:18 and has all kinds of cascading lines up and down the neck and interesting modal sequences. John Densmore's drums have some great moments of their own, little fills here and there, keeping it all grooving along.\n\nIt's a classic song, covered by many artists including Jose Feliciano, Shirley Bassey and Stevie Wonder.","classification":5,"fold":5}

But he has decided to extend that Crazy Love with a re-release of that album and his new single, Hollywood. The song really is nice, and showcases that signature style that has caught on so well with Buble's longtime fans. I really like the diddy that Michael recorded. He has really brought out that Frank Sinatra style of Pop to a whole new generation of fans that is worthy of what the crooner was able to do. I really hope that Michael can really keep it up. It definitely is a much better song than the ones that Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Katy Perry and all those other lackluster acts have so far made.

This is what I gather, anyway, as her 15 minutes of fame was already up several years before I was born.  I was introduced to this phenomenom as a young child, as my parents had a copy of this floating around that they'd received as a Christmas gag gift from some friends circa late 60s.  Always rearing it's bed-haired head around the holidays, when the whole family gathered around the stereo for a good laugh.  Funniest selections are:  the frightening \"Monday, Monday\", Nancy Sinatra's \"These Boots Are Made for Walking,\" as well as dad's \"Stranger's in the Night\" (dooooo-beee-dooooo-beeeee-dooooooooo!!)  and the all time Mrs. Miller classic \"Downtown\", complete with out of time vocals and ear-piercing bird whistles.

{"text":"This past year so far, 2016 we've have lost a lot of legends that really did know the strength of making great music with the losses of David Bowie and Prince. But also, we've seen a few legends really come back into the music industry after leaving the industry for personal matters. With Phil Collins coming back after retiring and re-releasing his catalog, many fans have really rediscovered his brilliance and talent as a musician, and a noble solo songwriter. But that has also been said to with the great Paul McCartney in his own legacy, with him re-releasing his solo collection of songs and what he did with Wings and other projects on his own, the legendary Beatle has really shown a lot of joy with people revisiting his solo work. But unfortunately, it is also a year of deviating sadness for Paul, with the heartbreaking death of legendary Beatles producer Sir George Martin, whom guided him with the fab four, and his solo efforts abroad. Paul has had some sadness, but with him releasing a career-spanning box set of his works, after The Beatles, and a new tour on the horizon for Sir Paul's brilliance, his solo work in tact just as strong as The Beatles and even broader alive and well. But for his work, the question is, Is Paul McCartney still relevant and strong? Yes he is.\n\nPure McCartney is a career-spanning collection of Paul McCartney's solo hits. There are two collections of this album, deluxe and regular, but this will focus on the 4 disc deluxe collection. The collection of his solo works is a strong ans distinctive reflection of McCartney's work with Wings and and his solo work that does display how brilliant Paul's gifts in song have been strong and show a nobly deep reflection of his great solo career, over 45 years of the making strong. The songs have all been remastered well, and show a lot of Paul's genius well from classic tracks like Maybe I'm Amazed, Let 'Em In with Wings, as well as newer hits for Paul that have been not as strongly recognized like New, No More Lonely Nights, Dance Tonight from Memory Almost Full and Sing The Changes from 2008's work The Fireman. The collection does highlight Paul's own work well, but the collection does have a few setbacks in play. First, Pure McCartney does overlook a few of Paul's biggest hits from his career and standout songs that Paul are richly distinctive like The Girl Is Mine with Michael Jackson, Ever Present Past, the theme song Paul did for the movie Spies Like Us, Freedom which Paul composed from Driving Rain in regards to the tragedy of the 9\/11 attacks and a few other classics. Not only that, but second, the collection is not in chronological order, where it can be more confusing for new Paul McCartney fans, that are just getting into his music for the first time, not though for die hard fans of Paul's greatness.\n\nDespite a few flaws, Pure McCartney is a very good buy for both die hard Paul McCartney fans, as well as newcomers that have never heard a song Paul McCartney had ever done before. this collection shows that Paul's legacy is still alive and well, and just as richly, widely celebrated as well as his work with The Beatles. It has been a legacy worth celebrating in every way from one of the world's distinctive and curious songwriters that is worth its money. I have always loved why Paul McCartney's classics are just as strong today, as they were back then in the 70's, 80's, and 90's, etc. I absolutely recommend this compilation a lot. We'll still say Maybe I'm Amazed, well we're amazed well with this album.\n\nAlbum Cover: B+\n\nSongs: B 1\/2+\n\nPrice: A-\n\nRemastered: A\n\nOverall: B+","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"After about 1\/2 hour in to this spectacle I began to wonder about the new drummer,  Mike M. and if he feels that he might suffer from 'Newsted ' syndrome;  meaning that as soon as he joins the band of his dreams he gets a decent album to show his talents at first but then the band starts to move in a different direction then what he might have hoped.\nThis double album has none of the classic DT features: endless sweeping guitar solos,  unfathomable drum playing, and song length of epic proportions.\nMost is mid paced music with an occasional heavy song or guitar solo. Otherwise it's Labrie taking center stage and I don't really think so much mediocre lyrics and solo type of singing will appease the die hard fan.\nI've listened to this a few times and to me it just sounds like an attempt that didn't quite work or hold any interest.\nNot much memorable in this one.","classification":2,"fold":5}

{"text":"By the early 1990s, Duran Duran's popularity had faded. Their album Liberty had proved a commercial failure, its two singles failing to make a significant showing on British or American charts.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dDLiVwpv89s\n\nIt was not until Capitol leaked \"Ordinary World\" to a radio station in Florida in the autumn of 1992 that it looked like Duran Duran mania might yet hit again. The single proved so popular that Capitol had to push the US release date up, ultimately releasing it in December.\n\nThe keyboards in the song were arranged and performed by Nick Rhodes and John Jones. The drums were played by Steve Ferrone at Maison Rouge.\n\nThe guitar solo that characterizes this song was arranged and performed by Warren Cuccurullo, former player with Frank Zappa. His instrumental rock trio version became a staple of his solo shows and was included on one of his solo albums \"Roadrage\".\n\nThe music video was filmed by director Nick Egan at Huntington Gardens in San Marino, California and the song later featured in the soundtrack to the film Layer Cake in 2005.\n\nSimon LeBon later performed the song with Pavarotti at a WarChild benefit.[2] The performance was released on home video as Pavarotti & Friends: Together for the Children of Bosnia.\n\nThe lyrics to \"Ordinary World\" were written by Simon Le Bon as the second of a trilogy of songs for his late friend David Miles; the others being \"Do You Believe in Shame?\" (1988) and \"Out of My Mind\" (1997).","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Man, this album was a big surprise. Australian Metalcore band Parkway Drive had been releasing consistent, easily identifiable records with a definite style that they wouldnt deviate from too much, they had a style that they worked within and had absolutely perfected.\nWith their fifth full-length studio album, Ire, Parkway take their rulebook and throw it too the wind. This is the biggest stylistic shake-up in the bands history by a country mile. This album is fresh, exciting, radically different than whats came before. Its such a big difference that you can almost expect the cries of sell out! to slither out of your speakers themselves. The thing is, this doesnt feel like a sell-out, its just an invigoration, a refreshening, and a new twist on things.\n\nThere are some seriously different atmospheres and a very different vibe to it than you may have been used to before. The songs are brighter, catchier, more sing-along focused, there are more concert-baiting backing vocals, theres more stomps and clap noises and theres way more melody. It is a strange mixture of the band going in a Traditional Heavy Metal or Power Metal route with much more bright major-key dual guitar melodies, as well as going in a groove or almost Nu Metal direction, with almost rapped vocals and some seriously rhythmic music. Its like constantly flipping between Machine Heads The Burning Red and then The Blackening, with Parkway Drives masterpiece Deep Blue being interjected every so often. Imagine Parkway Drive covering Five Finger Death Punch and Iron Maiden in a medley  thats a vague ballpark of the sort of directions this experimental album almost evokes, if not actually sounds directly like.\n\nIn terms of musicianship Parkway have always been excellent but the virtuosity on show here is next-level. Vocally, this is the most melodic and expressive Winston McCall has ever been. Lyrically, this album is continuing on from their previous album Atlas, but sounding even more vital, important and interesting without ever feeling preachy or finger-wagging.\n\nIts almost difficult to call out stand-out moments, because every song is different than the last, theres so much going on, so many songs that would be the best song on their peers album, so many moments that rip a huge smile across my face, that the album as a whole is just astounding.\n\nAt the time of writing, my favourite songs might just be the absolutely anthemic feel-good tune Vice Grip which sounds like the final scene in a sports movie, the massive groovey rhythmic scream-along Crushed which feels like it was written in 1999, and Vicious which has the best guitar of Parkways career to date  and when Winston starts going on about burning it all to ash, you feel where hes coming from.\n\nIf you thought Parkway Drive were just going to rehash old ideas, you thought wrong, variety is the key theme here. Interestingly though, theyve managed this without compromising themselves, it still sounds unmistakably like Parkway Drive. It is little touches theyve done before stretched out to whole songs, or traditionally Parkway sounding bits but with bongos underneath, or just focussing on one element of their sound more than others.\n\nOverall; If you are deathly afraid of melody, catchiness, or hand-clapsand you don't want anything on your music to sound any fun then by all means avoid this album but for everyone else, Parkway have released a game changing, barn-storming, absolute rager here, and if you like this sort of music at all you seriously need to check it out.","classification":5,"fold":5}

In fact, I'll send my minister friend a copy of this review sometime. My father was a minister, and I believe he would have approved also. I will admit that both my Dad and my last minister were very liberal ministers in very liberal denominations.\n\nWherever two or more of you are gathered in My name, there I am with you !!!

{"text":"Timothy Crane's \"Pianoforte\" is a set that jumps out at you.  I think I came to love the expressiveness of piano via the pop music of Laura Nyro.  The track that blows me away totally is the less-than-two-minute \"Awaken the Dawn\" with its piano elegant and celebratory and the orchestration that bolsters the sound.  From there, the CD opens into a wide emotional panorama with Crane's piano always evoking emotion such as on \"Clear Creek\" that moves briskly and then gets pensive.  \"Untouched\" has a classical feel.  \"Soli Deo Gloria\" is lush and lovely & makes me want to write a lyric and have it sung by Josh Groban.  \"Archetype\" starts with a strong orchestral introduction before Crane's piano takes over announcing triumphal jubilation.  The set closes with the musical reflection \"Stratford Road.\"  Timothy Crane's music is so lovely that I hope it finds the wide audience it deserves.  For now, it's one of my favorites.  Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Since his ongoing feud with 50 Cent started in 2008, Rick Ross has been on a mission.  And that mission was to become one of the best mc's in the game.  I've always liked Rick Ross but I admit that he was not a powerhouse lyricist when he first came into the game with Port of Miami.  He was a good rapper with occasional flashes of brilliance.  However, on his 4th studio album Teflon Don, I'm not hesitant to call Rick Ross the best mc right now.\n\nThere's no doubt that Ricky Rozay is everywhere these days.  Whether hanging with Diddy, forming supergroups, or hopping on the latest remix from everyone from Erykah Badu to Big Boi, there's no doubt the Rick Ross brand has grown significantly.  Ever since 50 Cent set out to \"destroy his life\", it seems that he has done nothing but grow in popularity.  Even through lawsuits (one vs. DJ Vlad and the other against Freeway Rick Ross (The Real Rick Ross)), he's managed to come out on top.  Now with Teflon Don he aims to continue his dominance of the rap game.\n\nAbout a month earlier Rick Ross released the Albert Anastasia EP. That contained great songs such as 300 Soldiers, Fire Hazard, Sweet Life ft. John Legend, and Money Maker and was the surprise EP\/Mixtape of the year (so far) easily trumping T.I.'s Eff A Mixtape which dropped on the same day.  That EP also contained the songs BMF (Blowin Money Fast) ft. Styles P and MC Hammer.  These songs became summer anthems especially BMF.  Currently you can't go anywhere without someone thinking they are Big Meech or Larry Hoover.  In response, those songs appeared on the album although slightly altered.  MC Hammer now features Gucci Mane and BMF has a slight variation in the beat.\n\nAfter that mixtape, anticipation for the album grew substantially.  Dubbed as \"the biggest release of the year\" and \"his best album to date\" many were still skeptical.  That doubt is all but removed now as the 11 track album is indeed one of the best albums released this year.\n\nGuests include headliners in every sense of the word.  Jay-Z, Kanye West, Diddy, T.I., Cee-Lo Green (yes that Cee-Lo Green), Erykah Badu, Jadakiss, Drake, Raphael Saadiq, Trey Songz, Gucci Mane, Chrisette Michele and Styles P.  There are many features on this album and you would think it would make the album bogged down and feel more like a compilation.  However this is not the case.  Each feature works beautifully and only moves to enhance the song rather than take it over.  Rick Ross performs extremely well lyrically on every song so there's no fall off there.  Production is provided by Justice League, The Inkredibles, No ID, Kanye, Lex Luger, & The Olympicks.\n\nI simply cannot decide my favorite song on this album.  BMF is just stupid (in a good way), Maybach Music III is a triumphant end to the trilogy, Aston Martin Music is so well performed and constructed and is a masterpiece, Super High is another feel good classic summer tune and on and on.  The Super High video was produced by F. Gary Gray and starred Stacey Dash.  The only song I'm not feeling is No. 1 ft. Trey Songz & Diddy.  It's just not up to par with the rest of the album and feels like Diddy forced him to put that on there.\n\nI do believe Rick Ross has outdone himself with Teflon Don and is one of the top albums of the year along with Sir Luscious Left Foot and Pilot Talk.  Do yourself a favor and pick up Teflon Don.  You won't be disappointed.\n\n*Also track down the Super High (Sativa Remix) ft. Curren$y and Wiz Khalifa,  Teflon Don Freestyle, the itunes bonus track Audio Meth ft. Raekwon, and Mafia Music Pt. 2 ft. Chrisette Michelle for added goodness.  There's also an extended version to Aston Martin Music that contains a verse from Drake instead of just hook work.*","classification":5,"fold":5}

With its powerful vocals, insightful and poetic lyrics, thumping bass lines and drums, it is a great modern rock album.

But I will say Again, Missing, This Close, and The Kind are my absolute favorites.  I feel that many modern rock\/hard rock bands tend to sound the same, yet Flyleaf is unique.

{"text":"With three decades of music under her belt, Amy Grant has already produced two best of collections.  And while they are both great, there was no place to find a sample of her entire career.  Until now.\n\nThis disc is an attempt to collect the hits from Amy's entire career, and it does a remarkable good job.  With just nineteen songs, it hits all the highlights.  It includes \"Simple Things,\" the title track from her last major studio release and \"Old Man's Rubble\" from her self title debut.  In fact, it includes at least one song from each of her major studio releases (not counting the hymns projects or the Christmas releases) except for her third, \"Never Alone.\"  Heck, it even includes \"Stay for Awhile.\"  That song originated on Collection and went on to become a hit in its own right.\n\nAnd there are plenty of classics here, from \"Baby Baby\" and \"Saved by Love\" to \"Thy Word,\" \"El Shaddai,\" and \"Father's Eyes.\"\n\nHaving said that, there are some drawbacks.  Fans who already own all her releases will find absolutely nothing new here.  All nineteen tracks have been previous released.  While they have been digitally remastered to sound better, I must admit I don't notice the difference.  Of course, when you are getting almost an hour and twenty minutes of music, this is being picky.\n\nAn equally picky point is the over representation of \"Heart in Motion.\"  I know it was her biggest release by far.  But it gets five tracks, which is about a quarter of the disc space.  And, to be honest, it's not my favorite of her releases.  Seems like one or two could have been cut to include a song from somewhere else.  Frankly, I'm a little surprised that \"Sing Your Praise to the Lord\" didn't make the cut.  That would have been a good switch.\n\nFinally, there's the timing.  Amy's last two releases have been a greatest hits and a live disc.  I know she just changed record labels, but I would have preferred to see this after another studio release.\n\nIn reality, these are all minor quibbles.  Any fan of Amy's music will find lots of memories in these nineteen songs and be glad to have them all in one place.","classification":5,"fold":5}

She delivers and does it with 110% on `Growing Pains'.\nAs with everything thing May J. Blige does she puts every ounce of emotion and rawness into every song on this set.  Every song on here is a stand out that it's hard to single out any song. There is everything from classic slow Mary jams to the upbeat dance tracks to songs with a rock twinge fused into them.\n\nMy favorites on here include:\n\"Work That\" which has a great beat to it and promotes a good motto - to be yourself!\n\"Roses\" is THE cut!!  WOW!  Great melody, great lyrics and amazing vocals!\n\"Work In Progress (Growing Pains\" is a song that we can all relate to. Very good\n\nI think the biggest appeal of MJB is that she is very relatable. She sings from the heart and it feels like every song was written for us; the listeners. She is your neighbor, your friend, your sister. Mary deserves every bit of success she gets and this CD is living proof of that! Amazing!!\n\n~~~JAC  07'","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Back in 1968, when I was 17 years old, most of my contemporaries were into music by people like Jimi Hendrix, Cream and the Rolling Stones. While I enjoyed all kinds of music, my preference during that time was for much tamer music. In the summer of that year, The Vogues released \"Turn Around, Look At Me\" a remake of a relatively obscure Glen Campbell tune from several years earlier. I immediately fell in love with the song and the group. The Vogues had been around for awhile, having achieved significant chart success on Pittsburgh's Co&Ce label with songs like \"You're The One\", \"Five O'Clock World\" and \"The Land of Milk and Honey\". But this sound was different. Fifties rocker Ernie Freeman had become the producer\/arranger for the group. His combination of lush production values and impeccable harmonies produced an incredibly pleasing sound that proved wildly successful. \"Turn Around\" was a huge hit for the group and was followed in swift succession by remakes of \"My Special Angel\", \"Earth Angel\", \"Till\", \"Moments to Remember\", \"Green Fields\" and others. I bought every one of these singles. In fact, I enjoyed The Vogues so much that I used to even play the flip sides frequently.  Here's to one of the best records they ever made.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Slow Train Coming is Bob Dylan's religious album, or rather, the beginning of a religious-based period of albums that progressed into the early 80's.  If THIS is what I can expect for the rest of this particular period, well... I probably won't even bother.  This is disappointing enough.\n\n\"Gotta Serve Somebody\" has lyrics that explain no matter WHO you are, you're gonna have to serve *somebody*.  The slow-paced disco beats and the straight forward lyrics leave a lot to be desired, however.  The disco connection unfortunately sets the pace for the rest of the experience which, judging by the numerous positive reviews here on amazon, might make this the most overrated album in Dylan's discography.  \"Precious Angel\" is generic mid-tempo plodding nonsense from beginning to end.  This is by FAR the worst Dylan album up to this point.  Self Portrait had variety at least.  Slow Train Coming, musically, is a product of the times- the dreaded days of the disco movement.  Yuck.  The \"Shine your light on me\" chorus is almost sickeningly uncharacteristic of Dylan.  You can tell he's forcing himself to sing such a line, and I swear I can almost sense that he's about ready to break out laughing during the chorus.  The only compliment I can give is that the Jerry Garcia-inspired guitar playing is decent.\n\n\"I Believe In You\" includes a melody so soft that it's basically a lullaby with terribly bland, simplistic and lovey dovey lyrics.  Anyone who believes Dylan can't write vocal melodies would have a good point here.  Normally I'd disagree with those people but not in this case.  \"Slow Train\" has a somewhat groovy rhythm, okay lyrics about a woman down in Alabama and figuring out and establishing your principles.  The guitar solo is actually really good.  Best song so far.  \"Gonna Change My Way of Thinking\" is a MAJOR low point.  Unsatisfying and disappointing Joe Walsh style mid-tempo hard rock with a VERY lackluster heavy guitar riff chugging along for the entire duration.  I'm mystified how so many Dylan fans can easily forgive such a failed experiment.\n\n\"Do Right To Me Baby (Do Unto Others)\" is where the religious lyrics are beginning to overstay their welcome as they're now becoming excessively irritating.  The bigger problem however is that there's *still* very little in the way of exciting musical ideas taking place here.  The songwriting is definitely uninteresting to me.  Just because Dylan finally revealed his feelings on religious matters doesn't automatically mean these songs are a pleasure to hear.  \"When You Gonna Wake Up\" is lyrically quite tedious and straight forward despite Dylan telling it like it is.  I'm sorry but this song sounds WAY too similar to Dire Strait's \"In the Gallery\" released a year before.  Same vocal mannerisms and punchy rhythm.  I *do* like how the tempo picks up during the chorus at least.  Yes and I'm aware that members of Dire Straits participated on this album so Mark Knopfler's style was bound to be noticeable either way but eh... I also have mixed feelings when the Band joined Dylan.  When you combine two artists with a distinctive style the result is that it usually limits the potential of *both* artists, or rather, encourages them both to hold back their full scope of creativity which is the case here with Dylan and Knopfler.\n\n\"Man Gave Name to All the Animals\" is a reggae style tune with a strong appearance of female vocals.  Dylan's voice is exceptionally hoarse but both the verse AND the chorus are oddly melodic and appealing to me.  This song almost sounds cute!  Definitely the most unusual song on the album.  It avoids resembling generic disco beats at least.  \"When He Returns\" is a piano ballad but... this is no ordinary piano playing!  It's VERY spiritual, uplifting, and emotionally a highlight.  Maybe even the best song on the album both lyrically and musically.  Great way to end the album.\n\nMan, I don't know guys.  Songs such as \"Gotta Serve Somebody\", \"Precious Angel\", \"I Believe In You\" and ESPECIALLY \"Gonna Change My Way of Thinking\" are REALLY unappealing to me.  I suppose the rest of the material is passable but come on, Dylan's first religious-themed album is hardly flawless.  Look beyond the lyrics and notice the mediocre songwriting covering up most of the album.  On a final note just let me mention that I have no problem whatsoever with the lyrics.  Dylan covers religion exceptionally well and his conversion to Christianity is commendable, but I wouldn't expect any less from the master of creative wordplay.  Besides, every Christian I've ever known has always been super polite and supportive towards me and my decisions.  The problem I have with the album is that the music doesn't match the lyrics.  Not many (if any) artists entered the dreaded, horribly dated days of the disco movement and came out with flying colors.  It's just impossible for me to look beyond the generic music and focus on the lyrics.","classification":3,"fold":5}

{"text":"I've always been of the mind state that the term \"ghetto\" is a derogatory word, but Jaheim has taken the word and made it his own. Within his music he celebrates the idea of ghetto, even going insofar as to title his sophomore album \"Still Ghetto\". While I respect Jaheim's allegiance to his roots, sometimes the sheer overload of the \"ghetto\" concept overpowers his musical prowess. Hailing from New Jersey, Jaheim is no doubt a talented singer capable of impressing even the most fickle with his ability. In fact his talent is so strong that it could almost make you angry that he doesn't have material - but images are made for reason and Jaheim has done well with his.\nThe first cut released from \"Still Ghetto\" was the hood anthem \"Fabulous\" whose catchy refrain sung by kids: \"don't hate on us, we're fabulous\", creeps into you head and seeks to take up permanent residence. From the celebratory \"Fabulous\", the album reflects on love with \"Diamond In Da Ruff\". It is on tracks like this as well as the soul-filled and passionate \"Put That Woman First\" that Jaheim shows you the depths and peaks of his voice. Since his debut, he's been compared to the legendary Teddy Pendergrass, a serious compliment that echoes in every part of Jaheim's vocals.\nThe album takes a slight turn with the less impressive \"Me & My B!tch\" and \"Tight Jeans\". While they all in their own way have some sort of appeal - it's here where you pity the subject matter. Jaheim has the voice of someone who should perhaps being singing ballads exclusively, but it often feels like his talent is wasted on sub par material not worthy of his voice. Sure, it's okay to appreciate the female form, but someone with this voice - you just know that he's capable of more. \"Backtight\" might have a dumb title - but it's subtlety is definitely a plus. The songwriting leaves you wanting a little more, but sound-wise it's very nice.\n\"Long As I Live\" is a tad overproduced, but because the vocals are so lush - it's hard to even care. On \"Everywhere I Am\", the crooner calls up the spirit of the older, fatter Luther Vandross (most of you know Luther was a much better singer when he ate Big Macs instead of lettuce). On the track, Jaheim sings out for his late mother and his talent is to be respected on the well-produced and well-sung track. \"Beauty And A Thug\", a duet with Mary J. Blige, tries to be jazzy but ends up just being not so great.\nThings get a little more \"ghetto\" with \"Every Which Way\" which should be discarded in the do not put me on an album pile. \"Special Day\" is another of the moments that make you want to root for Jaheim. His voice has so many beautiful elements to it, that you want people to like him - you want him to succeed and more importantly, you want his record label to hire him better writers and producers.\n- Final Thoughts -\nJahiem might not be a household name yet, but he has undeniable talent that will keep him floating for time to come. He'll definitely have to refine his talents if he wants to reach a broader audience, but for now he's happy being \"Still Ghetto\"","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"For those not familiar with Danny Seraphine, he was a founding member and the original drummer for the legendary band Chicago from 1967 through 1990.  He is also considered one of the great stylists and innovators on his instrument, forging a unique jazz-based rock style that propelled his supergroup through 20 top ten hits, 16 million-selling albums and numerous sold out concerts around the world for millions of fans. After Danny was \"fired\" by the group in 1990, he went into seclusion and put his drums aside.  Following years of production projects in the sudio and even Broadway, Danny got back into form in recent years with the inspiration of top industry musicians.  His jam sessions resulted in the formation of \"CTA\" and now the release of this studio work with a wonderful mix of Chicago classics and originals and other rock standards.  Bottomline: Every track works and every track cooks.  Danny's drum chops are back intact as he leads this band of top flight musicians with the amazing Marc Bonilla on guitar and Tower of Power's incredible Larry Braggs on vocals.  Yes, Danny Seraphine is back, back with a vengeance and showing the world a return to the original musical inspiration that made the early Chicago great.  While his former bandmates earn a paycheck entertaining the wine and cheese crowd with Peter Cetra covers like \"If You leave Me Now\" Danny and CTA are playing real music for the sake of the music itself and blowin' the door down.\n\"California Transit Authority\" is a superb CD and is a must listen for all Chicago fans and fans of rock music in general. The current members of Chicago could also stand to listen to this exciting work as a reminder of what they set out to accomplish musically in 1967, while using \"Chicago XXX\" as a coaster for their drinks.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Instead of giving you my mumbly take Im going to reproduce what author\/artist Matt Smith says about this re-mastered edition to Theocracys self-titled debut, from his liner notes: ITS HARD TO BELIEVE that the 10-year anniversary of the debut Theocracy album is already upon us.  10 years!  In some ways it doesnt seem that long ago, and in some ways it seems like a world away.  Things have changed quite a bit for us in that time, growing from a solo project to a five-member touring-band.  This album has long been out of print, and as more people have discovered us through Mirror of Souls and As the World Bleeds, weve gotten more and more requests to re-release it.----Theocracy was started as a solo project out of necessityI had written a group of songs that I really liked, but I didn't know any other musicians who wanted to play this kind of music at the time.  So I recorded demos of the songs with a drum machine, and those demos eventually became the debut Theocracy album.  When Ulterium decided to re-release it, we had to decide if we wanted to put it out as-is, or if we wanted to rework it (and if so, how much).  We considered re-recording everything from scratch with the full band, but a lot of people are really attached to this album despite its flawsand as a fan myself, I generally don't like it when bands mess with stuff from the past too much.  I believe that albums are snapshots in time.  That said, the one complaint that always followed this album was the production (and specifically the drum machine), so we knew we at least wanted to have Shawn record real drums on it and I wanted to remix it.  In the end, we decided not to re-record anything else: the drums are new, but everything else is the original recordings, just polished to sound as good as possible and given a fresh remix and remaster.  So this is still the first album, its just a good-sounding version of the first albumfinally!  Credits: All lead and choir vocals, rhythm, lead, acoustic and bass guitars, keys and orchestration by Matt Smith, drums by Shawn Benson.  Bonus moment: Smith shares some brief thoughts about each song.\n\nIt boggles the mind that this incredible debut was created by one man.  This album, which sports speed and melodic symphonic power metal that is constantly active and at times downright acrobatic, doesnt just astonish me as to how good (and tight) it is but how much Smith got out of his multi-tracking his vocals.  And his vocals are good, really really good.  The guitar work is tasty and varied.  He lays down a bed of power chords and then plays lines over it to delicious effect.  Smith also wears his Christian faith and knowledge on his sleeve.  Hes not a passing pom pom cheerleader for Jesus, shouting rah Jesus, rah! Sis boom bah!  He sings about theology, Christian history, personal struggles and redemption, and psychology from a biblical perspective.  Good stuff is an understatement.  I came across Theocracy with their As the World Bleeds and was blown away by the opening cut I Am off that release.  And while I love that release I think that this original proffering is actual, on the whole, better.  It would be a sin not to give it five stars.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"To say this is a curious album for the Rolling Stones is a bit of an understatement.  Mick Taylor had just recently left the band (he joined as replacement of the band's founding member, Brian Jones, in 1969), and his replacement had not yet been selected.  So what do you do when you're the biggest and baddest rock 'n' roll band on the planet?  You host auditions and record the whole darn thing, that's what!  Among the hopeful new guitarists were Rory Gallagher, Steve Marriott, Jeff Beck, Harvey Mandel, Wayne Perkins, Peter Frampton, and Ronnie Wood, though only Harvey, Wayne, and Ronnie's work would appear on the subsequent album.\n\nStylistically, the band found themselves at another crossroad.  Though the majority of the album sticks true to their electric blues roots, there are also elements of reggae (see \"Cherry Oh Baby\") and jazz (see \"Melody\"), which were pretty far out of the band's usual playbook.  And yet they managed to incorporate these different styles as only the Rolling Stones can do:  with balls and bravado.  Opening with \"Hot Stuff\" followed by \"Hand Of Fate,\" the door gets kicked in pretty heavily before the gears shift for their cover of Eric Donaldson's \"Cherry Oh Baby.\"  Side 1 closes with the slow blues burn of \"Memory Motel\" where both Mick and Keith contributed lead vocals to a love song embedded within a tale of life on the road.\n\nSide 2 opens with \"Hey Negrita,\" another bluesy-rock number, then shifts to the bluesy-jazz \"Melody,\" which features the piano work of Billy Preston rather prominently.  \"Fool To Cry,\" the album's second single, follows before closing out with the rockin' \"Crazy Mama.\"  Overall, Black And Blue is a solid addition to the Stones already stellar catalog, but it doesn't hold as much reverence as, say, albums like Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, or Exile On Main St.  But when you record some of the all-time greatest rock 'n' roll records back to back to back, don't you deserve a little time off?  A chance to step back and try something a little different?  I think that's what Black And Blue is all about, a chance for the Stones to step out of their comfort zone and try something a little different.\n\nIf all you know of the Rolling Stones is their greatest hits albums, you'll recognize \"Hot Stuff\" and \"Fool To Cry\" from Jump Back.  In my opinion, the strongest outings on this album are \"Hot Stuff,\" \"Hand Of Fate,\" and \"Crazy Mama\"; these are what I would consider to be the *essential* tracks on Black And Blue.  \"Cherry Oh Baby\" and \"Hey Negrita\" are pretty cool to listen to, and \"Memory Motel\" and \"Melody\" and excellent \"late night\" tracks for relaxin' at home.  I'm not a huge fan of \"Fool To Cry,\" though; it reminds me too much of \"Angie,\" and I tend to skip it whenever I listen to the album.  But overall, this is an album worth having whether or not you're out to collect the entire Stones catalog; if nothing else, it makes an excellent bookend (but in a good way).","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Let's face it--the Pixies couldn't win here.  If the new songs sounded too much like Doolittle or Surfa Rosa, people would be saying they are just resting on their laurels and reliving their past (albeit without the inimitable and sublime Kim Deal).  if the music deviated too much from the classic Pixies sound (and chord structures, let's face it---some of their songs are similar), then people would be asking why this isn't just another Frank Black solo album.  I think they find a pretty healthy medium here---there are at least a few songs here that absolutely stand up next to anything on Doolittle (I love Greens and Blues, Indie Cindy, Ring the Bell, and Magdalene 318, for starters).  There are a few songs which are just so-so, but really not a lot of those (the hit-to-miss ratio is pretty good for a 12-song album).  Yes, like many others I miss Kim's bass work and awesome background vocal work, but Black Francis's vocals are great on here and nearly make up for that, and Joey Santiago's guitar work to me is almost as integral to their sound as Black Francis---his crazy solos and surf-punk stylings sound awesome on here.  I'm awfully glad to have new Pixies material...it's good to have the real thing back (they have been imitated and cribbed by other bands constantly since their heyday).

{"text":"This is one of the best bargain sets out there of the complete Beethoven piano sonatas. Only $7 bucks and you get all 32 of them! These are played by the Hungarian pianist Jeno Jando, and I have become a fan of his because of this Beethoven set. I've read that he does the same thing that Glenn Gould did when he played: i.e. he hums. You can barely hear it on these recordings though, in case you were wondering. These were all recorded in Hungary back in the late '80's to the early '90's, when the collapse of the Iron Curtain brought freedom to Eastern Europe. The recordings are simple and not gussied up in any fancy kind of way. Because of this the lighter and shorter sonatas tend to come out better, while the bigger and heavier sonatas are still good but not great. This set will not diminish in the mind's eye the 2 greatest Beethoven pianists ever, Schnabel and Kempff, but it is still a must own for lovely-lovely-Ludwig-Van fanatics. Not to be missed.-------------------PEACE","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"...aka, The Return of Mogens Wldike!\n\nOf course, this set is a tremendous bargain, and on that level it is self-recommending. But this is not just a ridiculously cheap way to acquire 14 hours of rich and consistently delightful music by one of the wisest, wittiest, and most original composers of all time, Franz Joseph Haydn. It's also a collection of excellent perfomances by some of the most accomplished classical\/baroque performers of the period between 1950 and 1970. Along with exceptional performances of Haydn Symphonies 59 and 75 led by David Blum, a substantial selection of work by the excellent Griller Quartet, and a totally unexpected performance of Haydn's piano sonata #49 by the redoubtable Sviatoslav Richter, I'm especially pleased to see the return to the catalog of many fine performances by the outstanding Danish conductor Mogens Wldike. His London symphonies 99-104 are really good--and hold up well (based on spot checks) against some of the big names already in my rather extensive Haydn collection. Moreover, Wldike's exceptional talents as a choral conductor are exhibited in a superb performance of Mass #10 (Missa in Tempore Belli) and an equally outstanding performance--beautifully sung, beautifully paced-- of \"The Creation.\"\n\nFor a sample of his artistry just listen, for example, to Wldike's performance of Missa in Tempore Belli's 3rd movement, \"Gloria: Adagio.\" It begins with an usually expressive cello solo, followed by a beautifully sung solo by the great Viennese base Walter Berry, which intertwines with the cello line. The full chorus then enters quietly and blends raptly with the bass solo and cello, after which Haydn and Wldike turn up the voltage as Berry, the cellist, and the chorus bat the lead around enthusiastically in a wonderful playful closing to what had been a highly mystical musical moment. This is great stuff--and pure Haydn. With the return of Wldike's \"St. Matthew Passion\" in Bach Guild's recently issued Bigger Bach Set, among other great performances in that compliation, we have plenty to be thankful for.","classification":5,"fold":5}

So when I eventually get the double disc edition I'll update this review.\n\nThis is a solid album, probably the best they've released together and it makes me feel like I'm in musical church - demonstrating the truth in Frank Zappa's famous quote that \"Music is the best\" (in comparison to all other human actions and values like love, truth, wisdom, knowledge). That's the overall effect for sure - of this band and this album - and several times I catch myself noticing lyrics and thinking they are cheerful American ways of singing about the sublime spiritual truths of Advaita Vedanta. At least that's the feeling I get, but when I check the lyrics I can find no such thing - Lol! The music itself is a bit retro (70's style R&B, Pop-rock and Soul influenced), with plenty of great singing by Susan and layers of tasteful guitar licks by Derek. But with this band it isn't just about Susan and Derek, and that intangible is what makes it all so great.\n\nPs - 3\/13\/16 - As for the deluxe edition bonus disc it seems mostly unessential (I'd give it no more than 3.5 stars on its own). The five studio tracks seem more like early outtakes with a hesitant feel and weak sounding vocals. The three live tracks are better, with the cover of the Derek and the Dominos song \"Keep On Growing\" (a very Allman Brothers-esque jam they clearly are comfortable with doing) being the stand out - maybe even making the whole bonus disc worth getting","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"The Spinners have a long history. Started in Detroit in 1954, as of 2015 the group was still active, with Henry Fambrough the last surviving original member. Of that early quintet, baritone Fambrough, bass Patric Jackson and tenor Billy Henderson appear on their self-titled debut 1973 ATLANTIC Records LP (SD 7256). Technically considered an original, tenor Bobby Smith replaced James Edwards only weeks after the one-time Domingoes were formed. He's here, as is tenor Phillip Wynne, co-lead with Smith and a 1971 replacement for G.C. Cameron, who chose to stay with MOTOWN when the group left for ATLANTIC.\n\nThis album was a huge seller in its day. Certified Gold, an R&B #1 and #14 on BILLBOARD's 200.\nProducer, arranger, conductor Thom Bell also plays keyboards.\n\nOriginally an \"A\" side, \"How Could I Let You Get Away\" peaked at #77 on the Hot 100\nand reached #14 on BILLBOARD's R&B chart. Its flip side, \"I'll Be Around\" was the group's\nfirst ever #1 (R&B). It also was a Hot 100 #3. \"Could It Be I'm Falling in Love\" and \"One\nof a Kind (Love Affair)\" also made the R&B top spot, with the former a Pop #4 and the\nlatter peaking at #11 on the Hot 100. Four charting singles on one LP-- not bad!\n\nSIDE ONE\n[3:42] Just Can't Get You Out of My Mind\n[2:56] Just You and Me Baby\n[4:01] Don't Let the Green Grass Fool You\n[6:56] I Could Never (Repay Your Love)\n[3:10] I'll Be Around\n\nSIDE TWO\n[3:31] One of a Kind (Love Affair)\n[4:12] We Belong Together\n[3:47] Ghetto Child\n[3:46] How Could I Let You Get Away\n[4:13] Could it Be I'm Falling in Love\n\nTOTAL TIME: 40:14","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"The One is a very good cd and the reasons why are because it has great singing and outstanding arrangements and just very good instrumentation. It is obvious that Eric Benet listens to the radio all week and he listens to all kinds of music. The song 'Waitin' has a real bluesy sound that would be played on Saturday evening during the blues format of the urban adult contemporary station that I listen to. \"Come Together\" is a jazz-styled song that's risque and Benet performs it so professional. I love the single \"Harriot Jones\" because it has a good beat for listening and dancing. \"Redbone Girl\" is good track for those that like hip-hop\/r&b.\nBenet does a good job with the reggae song featuring Shaggy. Eric Benet is an outstanding singer, and producer who has consistently put out quality music and this cd may be his best one yet. The One in summation should get 5 stars.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Composed by Paul Simon, who said it came to him all of a sudden, Bridge Over Troubled Water is beautifully sung by Art Garfunkel. Larry Knechtel, a member of the Wrecking Crew, plays piano. It was inspired by a song from the gospel group the Swan Silvertones. It has been covered by such artists as Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley. Simon began working on it in the same house George Harrison sang about on the Beatles' Blue Jay Way.\n\nIt is a song of comfort and solidarity, it has a light in the darkness quality, no matter how low you feel I'm on your side. The piano gives it the feel of some sort of old hymn that has been around forever. Towards the end, the duo sing in harmony on the Sail on silver girl part, and the drums gain strength on see how they shine.  Angelic strings carry it away to the horizon.

{"text":"I love this band and have for nearly 25 years (since I was in junior high school in 1982--when \"Hard To Say I'm Sorry\" hit the airwaves).  While most artists get some criticism from me if they have too many ballads, this is one band that has been above that because they do the ballad so well.  I love all of their \"second career\" stuff from the 1980s.  I also have gone back to visit their earliest stuff--including listening to and enjoying their debut \"Chicago Transit Authority\" album.  Suffice it to say, I am a fan of all eras of this band.\n\nSo where to place this comeback effort?  After listening to it numerous times, my conclusion is that it nearly stands up to previous material.  I would agree with a couple of other reviewers that a couple of the ballads are a bit sappy even for them, and for sure the song order is strange with having all ballads followed by all uptempo numbers.  I also see no point to having two versions of \"Feel\" on the album--just stick with the trademark horns version.  Still, I am overall very pleased with the release of this album.\n\n\"Feel\" is an enjoyable track (whichever version you listen too)--very familiar but with a sound of modern production.  Good single, although I don't think it did too well chart-wise.  Ballads like \"King of Might Have Been\" and \"Caroline\" would fit right on such Chicago albums as 17-21 with their beautiful vocals and overall melodic sound.  Even the guest vocals on \"Why Can't We\" and \"Love Will Come Back\" are somewhat enjoyable and an interesting direction to take.  \"Long Lost Friend\" is a bit sappy but for sure very pretty.\n\nI agree with those who say the second half of the album comes as a nice surprise in returning to the \"roots\" of the band a bit.  \"90 Degrees and Freezing\" is a catchy, fun uptempo number, and \"Come To Me, Do\" is a vintage-sounding Robert Lamm-sung track.  \"Already Gone\" has some cool harmonies that are not so typically straight-ahead as so many Chicago melodies are.  \"Where Were You\", \"Lovin' Chains\", and \"Better\" are also refreshingly uptempo and a lot of fun to listen to.\n\nSome have called this a \"safe\" Chicago album, and to a degree I agree with that.  Many of the ballads in the beginning certainly fall into a familiar territory we have heard before.  While I have never heard a note of it, I am further intrigued by people's descriptions of the unreleased \"Stone of Sisyphus\" album and would love to have it see the light of day.  I also think of such albums as the amazing one that Toto put out this year and wonder what a Chicago album made in the same vein (i.e., totally doing what they want to do instead of perhaps pining too hard for a return to radio single \"glory days\") might sound like.  All that being said, for me this is overall a very satisfying release.  I have enough criticism here with the song order and \"safeness\" of the album that I can't quite give it a 5-star rating, but it is close.

{"text":"I love the music of the '80s... but somehow I was blissfully unaware of this song's existence until I stumbled upon it in a list from Cracked -- \"The Most Terrifyingly Epic Songs of the '80s.\"  I had heard most of the songs on the list, but had somehow overlooked this one entirely.  Cracked has a sketchy record when it comes to recommendations, in my opinion, but given that I loved most of the other songs on this particular list (\"Eye of the Tiger,\" \"Don't Stop Believing,\" \"Holding Out for a Hero,\" \"Love is a Battlefield,\" etc.), I decided I had to give this one a listen.\n\nI'll just say... if you're an unabashed fan of cheesy '80s poodle-hair rock, you will love this song.  :D\n\nThere's nothing subtle whatsoever about this song.  From the triumphant and soaring synthesizer opening to the epic guitar and drum riffs, this song's instrumentation is the epitome of goofy '80s rock.  The lyrics, while simple, are also rather nonsensical, seeming to hint toward a group of astronauts leaving Earth but otherwise defying easy explanation.  And the lead singer's voice is nothing to write home about, though at least he actually tries to carry the tune and doesn't just yell into the microphone.\n\nAnd yet somehow, this all WORKS.  It's a goofy song, yes, but it's the kind of goofy that leaves a huge smile on your face.  It's a song that's completely over-the-top but in the best possible way, and you can't help but want to bang your head and sing along when it comes on.  I haven't listened to anything else by Europe -- and from what I understand this is their only real hit -- but they sure hit a home run with this number.\n\nThis song has found plenty of new fans thanks to \"Arrested Development,\" but even if you've never seen that show, it's almost impossible not to like this song.  It's not the greatest hit of the '80s, but it sure is one of the most fun... and yes, one of the most terrifyingly epic.","classification":5,"fold":5}

Not a favorite, but it's OK. 7.5\/10\n\n--Wake Up Alone*********** I am obsessed with the title. I feel the same about the song. The lyrics are real and somewhat gritty.

{"text":"Fifteen years into their career, and South Florida's Nonpoint are showing no signs of slowing down. Even through the thick and thin of their major label years and the many starts and stops they experienced with hit singles and line-up changes, the Nonpoint train has been steadily chugging along like so many songs from the band's catalogue. With their seventh studio offering, the band have experienced a re-birth of sorts. Following the exit of bassist Ken Macmillan and guitarist Zach Broderick, frontman Elias Soriano and drummer Rob Rivera were forced to rebuild the band from the ground up. Absorbing the bulk of Chicago's little-known Inn Cinema -- including the duel guitar attack of Rasheed Thomas & Dave Lizzio (a Nonpoint first) and bassist Adam Woloszyn -- Nonpoint have made their return, bigger and perhaps stronger than before. It is appropriate then that they chose to leave their latest effort self-titled, to signify the rejuvenation of the band's chemistry.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Johnny K (Sevendust, Staind) lends his producing talents to assure that this is the finest sounding Nonpoint LP since \"To The Pain.\"\n\n- The new guys blend seamlessly into the classic Nonpoint sound, while adding their own flare. Why didn't Nonpoint have two guitarists all along?!\n\n- Elias sounds phenomenal as always.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- While the album rocks hard throughout, it lacks a more melodic, introspective tune in the vein of \"Past It All\" that would have pushed it from being a \"great\" Nonpoint album to the \"perfect\" Nonpoint album.\n\n- Some of Elias' lyrics are a little dumbed-down and on-the-nose while lacking the hooks of previous hits like \"Bullet With A Name\" or \"What A Day,\" songs which were admittedly silly but infectious just the same.\n\nHits:\n\n- \"I Said It\" and \"Left For You\" are the album's biggest and boldest hits. Fast-paced and intense, this is the band firing on all cylinders.\n\n- \"Another Mistake\" has potential to be the band's next big hit and is easily the most dynamic track on this set.\n\n- \"That Day\" and \"Go Time\" are a couple of the album's heaviest numbers with the new band members taking things to the next level. Crank these tracks to 11 and see what I mean.\n\nMisses:\n\n- \"Pandora's Box\" feels like a half-baked b-side.\n\n- \"Independence Day\" is an example of Elias' meat-head lyrics coming through. While it would sound adequate placed alongside the likes of Disturbed or Five Finger Death Punch, Nonpoint should be aiming a little higher.\n\nBest Listened to When: You've been shootin' the breeze all day.\n\nPersonally:\n\nAs a fan of these guys since \"Statement,\" I'm glad to see that they are still alive and kicking. Few bands from their era are still around, let alone relevant, so it's a testament to their work ethic that they can still hit a home run this late in the game. Also, having seen them a few weeks before this album's release with fellow nu-metal survivors Taproot, I can confirm that the new line-up is the real deal. The band sounds refreshed and more vital than ever. I highly recommend catching them when they come into town.\n\nThe Bottom Line(s):\n\nNonpoint are Nonpoint, and if you liked their previous albums, there is no reason you won't like this one. After the one-two punch to the kidneys that the disappointing \"Vengeance\" and the muddled \"Miracle\" offered, \"Nonpoint\" is a much needed game-changer and crowd-pleaser.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"If you opt to buy the 5-CD \"Super Deluxe Edition\" for the 5-song \"I.B.C. Studios Demos\"(on \"Disc Five\") be cautioned, that for these recordings, which predate The Stones' involvement with manager Allen Klein & his ABKCO company, that ABKCO has no tape source(reportedly Mick Jagger possesses the tape), so rather than ask Jagger to look for the tape, ABKCO did the simple thing, and they dubbed the five songs from bootleg. \"Diddley Diddley Daddy\"(still with the glaring speed fluctuation during the intro), \"Roadrunner\", \"Baby What's Wrong\" & \"I Want to Be Loved\" have been dubbed from one of the \"Swingin' Pig\" label bootleg CD's(either \"Bright Lights, Big City:20th Anniversary Edition\" or the \"I.B.C. Demos\" CD E.P.), but for unknown reasons, ABKCO didn't like the source for \"Bright Lights, Big City\" contained on those two bootleg CD's, so the song has been dubbed from a tinny-sounding vinyl bootleg, and no attempt has been made to de-crackle it. Granted, the source used for all five songs on the original \"Trademark of Quality\" label 1970's \"Bright Lights, Big City\" vinyl bootleg L.P. was itself a tape dub from an acetate, but this was an acetate that was still in pristine condition.\n\n  And I have always questioned whether \"I Want to Be Loved\" was actually from the \"I.B.C. Studios\" demos, or whether \"Trademark of Quality\" simply pretended that the song(which had never been heard by most Americans until the 1990's) was part of the \"I.B.C. Studios\" demos.  \"I Want to Be Loved\" DOES sound audibly identical to the version on the B-side of their first British Decca single \"Come on\"\n\n  There are many people (including me) who have wished that The Rolling Stones would finally permit ABKCO to bring us a definitive collection of 1960's Rolling Stones outtakes; to bring us a multi-disc set that would be every thing that \"Metamorphosis\" could have and should have been. But, inevitably ABKCO would find some way to totally or partly screw it up.\n\n  As for the 5-CD \"Grrr\", it's a decent selection of Stones singles and album tracks, but 13 of the songs are edited versions, due to CD capacity limits. Disc 5 has the \"I.B.C. Studios\" demos as a 13 minute disc, but if the 80 hits and album tracks had  been evenly spread across five full length discs, there would have been no need to use edited versions. As for the song line-up, the songs are not quite in chronological order, and there are some baffling inclusions and omissions. \"That's How Strong My Love Is\" & \"Flight 505\" are puzzling inclusions, while \"Tell Me(You're Coming Back)\" and \"Around and Around\" are omitted. Go figure. As for myself, I found an \"alternative source\" for the 5-CD set, and I am left with no doubt that I made the correct decision.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"One of Viennas first music publishers, Franz Hoffmeister (1754-1812) was close friends with most of the composers of the high Classical Era. In a letter, Beethoven referred to him as my most beloved brother, and Mozart dedicated his String Quartet in D Major, KV 499 to him. He also wrote a little music, with at least 8 operas, as many as 66 symphonies, about 57 string quartets and numerous other chamber works to his credit. Much of that chamber music includes a flute, as does at least 25 concertos.\n\nPublished in 1795, his first D Major Concerto on the present recording is No. 24 on that list. With an orchestral introduction that is nearly 3 minutes in length, the martial Allegro that begins the composition is an ambitiously expansive movement. Driven by horns and booming tympani, it effectively sets up the feathery entrance of the solo flute. Instead of creating an interactive relationship, Hoffmeister uses the symphonic backing to fill in behind the single wind instrument, deftly weaving the orchestral passages around the melodic lines, following the breath patterns and not overwhelming the delicate sound of the flute. And it is a virtuosic display. Demanding a high level of technique, this first movement is challenge that the flutist, Bruno Meier easily rises to meet.\n\nEmploying a gentle Alla plocca ma lento as the leisurely middle section allows the flute ample opportunity to stretch out and embellish the charming, aria-like tune. As the horns waft overhead, the music shifts into G Minor, adding drama by the use of chromatic modulations and striking harmonies before easing back to the major key for the placid ending. A bubbly flute introduces the festive theme for the closing Rondo Moderato. Rapid runs and extreme changes of register mark the bravura solo work while tempo shifts, brief episodes in minor, playful syncopated flourishes and a surprising time signature change into triple meter enliven the boisterous finale.\n\nAnother spacious Allegro opens the 21st concerto, published in 1788 and also penned in D Major. Buttressed by the horns, the orchestral intro for the first movement is nearly as extensive as the other opening allegro. Elegant and immediately engaging, the solo wind carries the tuneful excursions through wide ranging development again without much interaction with the symphonic support.\n\nIn the dark key in D Minor, the dramatic Romanza Adagio bristles with ominous undertones as the flute fashions a remarkable contrast with the accompaniment for strings only. Despite an interlude in the relatively brighter F Major, the heavy aura of the 2nd movement never lifts. But the brash finale, a triple metered Rondo Allegro completely dissipates the gloom. Brilliant virtuosity in the flute lines characterize this sparkling close to the concerto.\n\nThe 2011 recording by Naxos is terrific, well balanced with depth and excellent detail. Bruno Meiers work on solo flute is exemplary, and the Prague Chamber Orchestra provides sturdy and sensitive support. Although these 2 fine compositions were issued during Hoffmeisters lifetime, this disc marks their world premiere. One of the most popular composers during the Viennese Classical period, he fell into obscurity upon his death. While his work will never rival Beethovens, it does present a glimpse into this excellent craftsmen who became an also ran in the shadow of the master from Bonn.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Starts off great, gets bad real quick.\nSome of the biggest names in R&B (or urban music if you read the insert) right now are on it, with some strong newcomers.  The Erykah Badu song is a powerful ballad of laziness and better than almost everything on her \"Mama's Gun\" record.  Rookie Glen Lewis gives us the strongest song on the CD, \"Don't You Forget It\", which is the track they're using in the TV commercials.  When his record finally drops (11\/2001) I'll get it on the strength of tis track.\nThe only other standout tracks belong to India. Arie, who gives us a great track in the tone of the stuff on her album, but smoothed around the edges, \"Butterfly\"; and Jill Scott, who's offering is, sadly, a remix of a song we've already been inundated with over the past year, so it already sounds old once the laser hits the disc.  Jill can do no wrong with me, but this was a mistake.  It's a cool track, but we could do with something new about now.  Fortunately, she's dropping a double album this month as well to make up for it, so I'll be content soon enough.\nThe rest of the album is abhorrent.  Macy Gray (whom I never liked anyway) is even worse here.  I'd rather hear her sing the National Anthem again.  The new cats on the rest of the disc don't lift off, and even vets like the indestructable Amel Larrieux and the Roots don't keep up the groove of the record.  After about the 5th track, you're in for some rough riding, buddy.\nThe tracks by Glen Lewis, Badu and Arie are almost wort the disc, though.  Almost, except that lewis's track will likely be on his CD anyway, and Arie will probably put this track on her next record as well, so you'll end up with the best stuff one way or another.","classification":2,"fold":5}

{"text":"Lloyd Banks drops his 3rd major label solo album after a long break of just over 4 years.  He's more of a veteran in the rap game, being around for over 8 years and he has a lot of experience under his belt.  Being a part of 2 mainstream\/major label G-Unit albums, but mostly the dozens of solo & G-Unit mixtapes that have been put out, and what made him (and the rest of G-Unit) well known and famous.  Much more mainstream than when he first came on the scene, and it shows the most on the major label albums, this one not excluded.  He still has some harder, more gangsta songs; but more and more radio friendly and songs for the ladies\/teens (much like Fabolous).  As far as comparison to his other solo's, I'd say they are all pretty close to one another, but this is probably my least favorite (his debut \"The Hunger for More\" and \"Rotten Apple\" I'd say are just slightly better and more consistant albums).  This one has 13 songs, 4 are ok, 1 is borderline skippable, and the other 8 are good, but no classic or even near classic song.  Guests are heavy as well, on 11 songs (rapping on 6 and doing the hook on 5).  Production is hit or miss basically throughout the album, and not too many are ones I've heard of before.  Cardiak does 3 songs, Frank Dukes, Justice League, Ryan Leslie, Grind Muzik & Bliz Money, Nick Speed, Prime, G Sparkz, Dirk Date, The Watcherz, Dready all do 1 song.

{"text":"EARTH SONG is nothing short of MJ's greatest work.  While Michael definitively ruled as \"The King Of Pop\" between the releases of OFF THE WALL and DANGEROUS, some of his later work suffered from intermittent bouts of artistic deadpan.  This single, however, released during that period of flux before his unfortunate end, is his most outstanding recording ever.  Emotionally vexing, angry but tempered with hope, musically complex and built upon a bedrock of progressive rock architecture, EARTH SONG demonstrates his ability to be utterly transformative and sincerely artistic in protest.  If you, like me, collected those Pop Music perfections of OFF THE WALL, THRILLER, BAD, and DANGEROUS, allowing the rest to lay low, once you either saw the video for EARTH SONG or caught the song on radio, or even saw the updated performance from THIS IS IT (this version reaches the pinnacle of sound engineering) it probably became a must-have for you, so adding it to your MJ collection digitally through Amazon is a perfect solution.  The sound on this digital download is amazing and coupled with a few others and\/or CD rips, you can assemble yourself a wonderful personalized MJ CD.  I sincerely consider EARTH SONG to be MJ's compositional and musical masterpiece.  Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"Jaheim shows the world that being ghetto isn't always a bad thing.  In fact, he makes ghetto look and sound damn good!  \"Still Ghetto\" is Jaheim's sophomore album.  He is a prime example that everyone's sophomore album can be just as good as the debut.  The album's tracklisting is all around great, from the order of the songs to the lyrics and instruments.\n\n \"Still Ghetto\" is about love and relationships for the most part.  Jaheim seduces and croons his female listeners practically the entire album.  \"Put that Woman First\" is the mid-tempo track that was released and went on to be a hit for 2003.  Jaheim explains that if a man does not make a woman feel that she is at the top of his list, she may leave him for another man who will.  A lot of women and even men like this song.  Jaheim showcases his seduction skills on the song \"Special Day\".  In this song Jaheim tells his woman it is her day and asks her what she would like to do.  It is a slow song with a beautiful message and melody.  \"Everywhere I Am is Jaheim's dedication to his late mother, Julie.  In the song he lets his mom know that whatever he does, he feels her presence, even in the biggest events of his life.  This song is truly heartfelt to anyone has either lost their mother or has a close bond with her.  Another favorite on \"Still Ghetto\" is Jaheim's duet with Mary J. Blige called \"Beauty and a Thug\"  This song is about a man and a woman from different walks of life who attract each other. This is a lovely song.\n\n \"Still Ghetto\" is one of those CD's that anyone who gives it a complete listen is sure to love.  Jaheim takes being ghetto to a whole new level!

{"text":"Out of everything that I've reviewed so far for 2013 this is perhaps my second most anticipated album of the year. I was expecting this album to reach extreme levels of greatness and part of me expected this to be the best Wu related album since Only Built For Cuban Linx... Pt. II. While it may not have lived up to my personal hype, it would be wrong of me to deny that Twelve Reasons To Die is an extremely solid effort from Ghostface.\n\nTwelve Reasons To Die is the tenth studio album from Ghostface Killah and his first since 2010's Apollo Kids. It's a concept album following the story of Ghostface Killah (aka Tony Starks), an ex-enforcer of the DeLuca family who gets set up by the kingpin's daughter. His remains are then pressed into 12 vinyl records that, when played, bring Ghostface back from the grave to seek revenge on the DeLuca family.\n\nWhile it may not be the most complex or creative story ever written, it's enjoyable enough. It does a nice job of creating a mob story while mixing in that Hip Hop element (12 vinyl records). My biggest problem with this release is Ghostface Killah's delivery. It's no secret that Ghostface Killah has a very smooth delivery and that he's no stranger to complex rhyme schemes, but none of that is present on here. His rhyme schemes are very basic (a, a, b, b, c, c, d, d, etc.) and his delivery is occasionally cringe worthy. At times it didn't even feel like I was listening to a 20 year vet rhyming over these beats. It doesn't kill the experience, but it does bring it down a bit.\n\nIt's no surprise that almost every guest on here is a member of the Wu-Tang Clan or someone who's affiliated with them in some way, with William Hart being the only exception. U-God and Killa Sin each makes two appearances, Masta Killa and Inspectah Deck make three appearances, and Cappadonna makes one. Inspectah Deck is probably the standout of the group providing some of the most memorable verses for me. The two weakest links, in my opinion, were Cappadonna and Masta Killa. They weren't terrible, but at the same time they didn't excel in any category. There were a couple of uncredited vocalists as well. I was hoping I would get my package from Soul Temple Music before I wrote this to see if they were mentioned in the liner notes, but there was some complications with the shipping so I'm still waiting on that. If I see their names specified in the booklet I'll update this portion of the review.\n\nThe entire album is produced by Adrian Younge with Bob Perry and Andrew Kelley co-producing track eight \"Rise of the Ghostface Killah\". Honestly this has to be some of the best production that I've heard in the past few years. It has the perfect vibe for an album like this, laid back yet powerful. With that said, I think the way it was produced is what crippled Ghostface technically. He doesn't always sound comfortable on some of these beats and I think that hurt him in the final product.\n\nStandout Songs: \"Rise of the Black Suits\", \"An Unexpected Call (The Set Up) (Feat. Inspectah Deck)\" & \"The Sure Shot (Parts 1 & 2)\"\n\nOverall Score: 8.5\/10 - So this wasn't everything I hoped it would be, but I can't deny just how much I'm enjoying it. The concept, while simple, is enjoyable and Ghostface did a good job at making the story easy to follow. Adrian Younge did a great job with the production and the guests all did their thing as well. If you're a fan of the Wu or just a fan of dope Hip Hop then I can't recommend this enough.","classification":4,"fold":5}

This was no exception but I noticed something different that I haven't heard in a while that takes me back to albums like \"Homogenic\", \"Post\", and \"Vespertine\". A lot of the songs are very string based and create a melancholy atmosphere but the electronics and synths in the background almost give it a beautiful sadness or longing. Even in her lyrics, you can can hear that there is a hole or void that she cannot fill and it is tearing apart her heart. That's where this album and the \"Strings\" version have something in common: the beauty in sadness tone. Her lyrics are very powerful and honest but she also sometimes displays alot of fragility and reflection. This for me is one of Bjork's best or in my top 5 Bjork albums. This is pure artistry that cannot be duplicated, anybody that is a fan of Bjork pick this up and you'll be satisfied.","classification":5,"fold":5}

But for me the best songs for working out\/running are the ones that have the right cadence, the right rhythm.  \"Sunny Came Home\" has that for me.\n\nMy most comfortable running pace matches music that plays at 84 beats per minute.  Simply said, that's what this song has.  It's actually relaxing to me to have calm music in my running mixes.  After all, I'm not super competitive, and when I run I listen to my body, the road, and music.  \"Sunny Came Home\" is a great addition to my running mix.\n\n5 stars","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"This past December, I purchased Meghan Trainor's Title as a present for myself because I had heard a number of her songs on the radio and loved them so I figured it made sense to purchase her CD. I ended up loving that CD so much that when I saw she was releasing another album, I immediately pre-ordered it and literally counted down the days until its release date. Yes, I was that excited. This morning I couldn't wait to listen to this CD when I saw it in my Amazon Music library and listened to it while getting ready for the day. I'll admit that I was initially quite disappointed because I had hoped to hear another album similar to Title but with new and fresh lyrics. Instead, Thank You seems to be a different style with a couple songs similar to her music on Title and it's more experimental.\n\nThank You consists of 12 songs (15 if you purchase the deluxe edition) and the only one I had heard prior to buying this album was \"NO\" which has been on the radio for awhile. The music on Title was a unique combination of doo-wop, hip-hop and pop. Thank You has some techno beats and rap in addition to those genres. There are a number of fast, upbeat songs as well as some sweet ballads. I feel some of the songs aren't very interesting but I do have some favorites. I love the energetic \"NO\" which is currently on the radio, the beautiful ballad \"Kindly Calm Me Down,\" the fun \"I Won't Let You Down,\" the spunky \"Dance Like Yo Daddy\" which is reminiscent of many of the songs from Title, and the bubbly \"Champagne Problems.\" I also got to listen to the three additional songs that are on her deluxe edition courtesy of Prime Music. I really like \"Mom\" which is a sweet song about how much she loves her mom and features her own mom Kelli Trainor and \"Friends\" which seems appropriate with summer and graduations rapidly approaching.\n\nAfter I finished listening to it the first time, I had to ponder it throughout the day and then I listened to it again this afternoon with more of an open mind. I am now on my third time listening to it and it honestly keeps getting better. It's hard not to compare Thank You to Title because they are completely different albums but I don't feel the same level of excitement with Thank You that I did while listening to Title. Overall, I think Thank You is good, but not great, and I like that Meghan Trainor is experimenting with different styles. She co-wrote all of the songs on this album and was one of the executive producers of this album as well. If you are looking for the same style of music as Title, I think you will be disappointed with Thank You, but it still contains some good, fun songs so that makes me glad I bought it.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"I personally love this movie. Staring Hugh Jackman, who happens to be my favorite actor right now is wonderful in this move as he portrays a selfish, gambling, con-man who has no thoughts for anything or anyone other than Robot boxing. Then he gets the news that reunites him with his 11 year old son. The son also has an interest in Robot boxing and finds a Robot of his own to fight with. From there it is very reminiscent of the Rocky series of movies. Little boxing Robot overcomes all odds to fight in a match with the champ, knocks champ out but champ is saved by the bell. I won't give away the ending but i think you know what it is already. The father and son grow to really love and be proud of each other and in the final match Huge Jackman's character fulfill his dream by being a boxer himself. Because the little Robot can only finally fight through a shadow boxing mode so Jackman is really doing all the moves. There is a scene when Jackman is doing the moves for the little Robot to follow that is Kleenex worthy and really brings together all of the important character. I would recommend this movie to everyone. Perfect for adults and of course kids.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"So wonderful to have one of the most extraordinary progressive acoustic musicians together again.\nChris continues to be the lead man, doing the majority of the lead vocals, and producing shimmering mandolin work. He just has \"IT,\" that rock star swagger, while backing it up w the chops to play w the likes of Yo Yo Ma, and pretty much anyone, in any genre.\nSarah's vocals have matured. Even Sean sounds confident singing 21st of May.\nHayloft is a bit of an odd choice. I am not sure if it was done tongue in cheek, like when they used to do Brittany Spears' Toxic live. It is curious, but kind of fun, & funny.\nThe last 3 songs are the best, by far. Elephant is an instrumental tour de force. You Don't Know is a fun piece, in the spirit of Spit on a Stranger. Where is Love Now is a wonderful concluding note.\nThe one obvious gripe is the length of the disk. Clocking in at less than 38 minutes is really kind of chintzy. It has been, what, 7-8 years. Can't we have come up with just a few additional songs to round it out to at least 60, or even 50, minutes?\nPerhaps its the \"leave them wanting more\" thing. I certainly want more.

{"text":"Hallelujah!  George Strait and MCA have finally released a single-disc collection of hits that isn't skimpy!  Unlike Strait's previous three sets that were made up of ten prior hits, Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is comprised of fifteen tracks, of which two are new recordings.  Specifically, it picks up where the multi-disc retrospective Strait Out Of  The Box leaves off, with the old hits culled from Strait's 1994 through  1998 albums.\n While more extensive, this anthology is far from  perfect however.  \"Lead On\" and \"King Of The Mountain\" (the latter barely  scraped into the top 20) drag along unmelodically and are slower than  molasses.  Some of the other singles seem like rewrites of old Strait hits  (\"I Can Still Make Cheyenne\" recalling \"Amarillo By Morning\" and  \"Adalida\"  bringing to mind \"The Love Bug\").  With \"Carrying Your Love With Me\" and  \"Carried Away,\" Strait even repeats himself within the same collection.\n  If you think I am getting too nit-picky about this set, you may be right.  The crisp, heartfelt delivery on \"You Can't Make A Heart Love Somebody\" is  just one example of why many consider Strait to be the Sinatra of country  music.  And as \"Blue Clear Sky\" and \"Round About Way\" illustrate, no one  handles a play-on-words more effectively than Strait.  You'd also be  hard-pressed to find country music more riproaringly enjoyable than \"We  Really Shouldn't Be Doing This.\"\n The two new singles contribute in  mixed degrees to the Strait legacy.  Recent chart-topper \"The Best Day\" is  nice, but it also seems too similar to some old hits (\"Love Without End,  Amen,\" \"Check Yes Or No).\"  Here our protagonist progresses through a love  for camping, cars, and finally, his ideal woman.  Much better is \"Murder On  Music Row,\" a duet with Alan Jackson.  This mega-event pairing of two of  modern country's most traditional (and successful) artists is an  effectively acidic lament on the predominantly pop sound of today's  country....\n As  noted earlier, Latest Greatest Straitest Hits is not flawless.  In light of  its several strong points, however, it has to be recommended as a must buy  for all country music listeners.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Admittedly, I have not yet listened to the entire collection.  15 hours, spread over 176 tracks, is a lot of Beethoven!\n\nFirst, I would point out that these are complete works, which is absolutely essential in my opinion.  (Some collections just throw together a collection of random movements from different compositions... those are terrible and worthless IMHO... like reading random chapters from unrelated books.)\n\nThe quality of what I have heard so far is quite good.  Very credible performances, and very decent rrecordings (I'm listening on AKG 280pro headphones).  Everything has sounded very polished and professional.\n\nUndoubtedly, if you ask enough musicians, someone will prefer a given orchestra, or a favorite conductor, or a world-renowned pianist.  There are too many variables in classical music for me to say \"this collection is the world's best.\"  Nobody could intelligently say that about ANY collection; someone else would be bound to disagree.\n\nStill, based on what I've heard so far, I can recommend this Big Beethoven Box without any reservations.  Buy it, pick out a symphony or another work, and enjoy.  I think you'll agree this is an excellent collection for the price.","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"There are just so many hits collections that realy seem to miss out when it really comes to very successful artists. That has always been the case with love songs collections as well, because there are just so many of them that really don't seem to showcase enough material that really reflects the best of those love songs. That just isn't the case with Chicago, and their great music collections, because they definitely hit the nail of the head very, very well. Their music has endured extraordinarily well for over thirty-five years. There have been a few successful hits collections that really reflects Chicago, and this one is just no acception.\n\nChicago's 2005 Love Songs collection, consists of their most well recieved love songs from thier long-time career. The album conists of 18 tracks, and a couple of live rendidtions of classics never before released on any Chicago album as well. The collection contains a lot of great tracks inclding You're The Inspiration, Will You Still Love Me, Beginnings, as well as classics like Colour My World Hard Habit To Break, and Hard To Say I'm Sorry. The album also includes a couple of live recording with Phillip Bailey from Earth, Wind & Fire fame, on versions of If You Leave Me Now, and the Earth, Wind & Fire classic, After The Love Is Gone, which really sounds delightful and lively.\n\nWhile there love songs albums that really don't sell very well, or just miss out on a lot of great songs, Chicago's Love Songs really displays very, very well within not just its price, but the vast number of classic Chicago tracks here. While many not at all be interested in this collection, it really is a good reflection of Chicago's best ballads.\n\nAlbum Cover: B+\n\nSongs: B+\n\nPrice: A-\n\nRemastering: A-\n\nOverall: B+","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"One Of Miles Davis Best Live Albums\n  Fresh off the phenomenal success of his next masterpiece Sevens Steps In\n  Heaven in 1963, Miles Davis and his innovative second quintet would fascinate\n  the jazz scene with a highly successful tour of Europe which also included their\n  performance that was captured on this live album the following year. Recorded\n  live at Frances Le Festival Mondal at Antibes in late 1963 and then released in\n  1964, Miles Davis In Europe presents a no less exciting performance from The\n  Miles Davis Quintet when they showcased an unforgettable concert date which\n  was a pivotal part of Miles 1963 European Adventure. Beginning with a official\n  announcement by noted jazz M.C. Andre Francis, the exquisite track set would\n  proceed on a robust note with a striking backbeat take on Autumn Leaves and\n  marvelous takes on Milestones, All For You and there 14-minute lets tear this\n  apart workout finale on Walkin.  What makes Miles Davis In Europe quite the\n  live success is how the band showcased strong solos where George Coleman\n  played his tenor saxophone with such a muscular scouring sound which prove\n  surprisingly effective within the new young rhythm section and for the quintets\n  adventurous avant-garde leanings and searing virtuosity was highly displayed\n  with the young Tony Williams propelling his dynamic drum solos.  Also added\n  to the live album is how Herbie Hancock strikes up his piano artistry where he\n  swings his occasional hard bop virtue and an easy-listening endurance that is\n  evident on their take on I Thought About You as he turns up the standard with\n  impressionistic and free-flowing balladry that also allows Miles to spread wide\n  swaths of tonal colour and deep notes that bends across the stage. Now here\n  is another great live album from the great Miles Davis, one that will remain as\n  solid in its expressive abstract format.","classification":4,"fold":5}

But contemporaries did not appreciate his talent, since it is known that the great composer's life dragged out a miserable existence. His fate was heavy and largely unhappy. But his work is permeated with the light of love and many centuries later, his music inspires the desire to live and to admire his genius. This album beautifully conveys the genius of the composer.

{"text":"Let me start by saying that I think this is the best album Bonnie has ever made! It absolutely harkens back to some of the 70s style work with of course all of the style she has forged on through out her career. I am glad she still does a good amount of covers because she can interpret another artist's song like nobody's business, (right up there with Sinatra almost). A great take on INXS's Need You Tonight and a tasty cover of Los Lobos Shakin' Shakin' Shakes help to add some nice punch to the album, but even the more ballad style songs still have a nice upbeat feel to them. The album flows really nice and just incredible slide guitar from Bonnie as well as some incredible playing from her entire band make this one hell of a listen, which brings me to the vinyl version. WOW! Did they do a nice job with this one! It comes as a 2-LP set recorded at 45rpm, yes 45rpm, and that really helps to let the music open up and breathe more! Being recorded at 45rpm allows the cartridge to read the grooves at a faster rate, thus delivering some amazing sound quality! The cover is really nice with the inner sleeves containing all of the lyrics. My only issue is that there should have been separate sleeves for the vinyl made of rice paper for better protection, but I had some so easy fix. My wife and I love vinyl and thanks to my son who bought this from Amazon as a gift for us and made sure we had it on street date. Way to go Bonnie, just a wonderful album!","classification":5,"fold":5}

The reason why I like this song is because I liked Red, Red, Wine. This is has a familiar ring to it, I am not into reggae that much but I do like those two songs from UB40; and Wild World from Maxi Priest. So if you know any of those song you should like this one, for those new to UB40 check out the MP3 sample. I grew up on 70's, 80's, New Wave, but I like Ub40, you might too.\nTHX,\nKris L.

{"text":"\"Bringing Down the Horse\" will probably always have my favorite Wallflowers songs on it.  \"Red Letter Days\" is definitely my favorite album by them, infused with a manic energy and an urgency not normally experienced in their rootsy, bluesy, and usually cathartic music.  \"Rebel Sweetheart\" didn't hook me but I can still listen to it and it will feel fresh and offer interest.  \"Breach\" left me completely cold.  So where does \"Glad All Over\" fall in their stock of albums for me?  As a pretty solid outing probably falling just behind \"Bringing Down the Horse\".  GAO may be best described as a blending of \"Rebel\" & \"Red\", but the songs have a more cohesive flow and feel generally tighter than they did on \"Rebel\".  The tempos are mostly up and so is the psychology of the album and there is a strong undercurrent of country and roots rock flavor (especially reinforced by the pedal steel guitar, organ, and wurlitzer).  Dylan's straight-to-the-heart by way of sympathetic and easy to connect to events infused with a spiritual, God inclusive consciousness may make this a less poetic adventure but definitely helps connect us to the characters and moments that inhabit these songs and make us feel like we're along for the ride (see especially \"First One In the Car\", \"Have Mercy On Him Now\", & \"Hospital For Sinners\").  The title of this album, \"Glad All Over\", is truth in advertising as there is a generalized atmosphere of smoke and hope; the pathos as especially seen on \"Bringing Down the Horse\" or the nervous anxiousness as displayed on \"Red Letter Days\" is largely absent here though it manages more energy IMO than any of their other albums with the exception of \"Red\".\n\nAs a person who doesn't generally go for bluesy, rootsy music I still find myself drawn to and enjoying the Wallflowers.  I love Dylan's voice and delivery, and the soul he infuses the songs with.  Good, solid songs showcased here that will make you glad you listened.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"It took awhile for Jaheim's 1st video to grow on me.  I would see \"Could It Be\" quite often on BET and finally after awhile the track began to grow on me.  Eventually, I picked up Jaheim's 1st CD entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ghetto-Love\/dp\/B00005899K\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ghetto Love<\/a>.  My favorite tracks included \"Looking For Love\", \"Ghetto Love\", \"Just In Case\", \"Anything\" w\/Next and \"Ready Willing & Able\".  His debut was definitely strong despite there being some filler amongst the 21 tracks.  His 2nd CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Still-Ghetto\/dp\/B00006WKYJ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Still Ghetto<\/a>&nbsp;got a tremendous push because of the 1st single \"Fabolous\" that was an anthem dedicated to the young kids that are growing up in this crazy world.  My favorite tracks ended up being \"Diamond In Da Ruff\", \"Let's Talk About It\", \"Beauty & Thug\" w\/Mary J. Blige, \"Long As I Live\" and \"Me & My B____\".  In 2006 Jaheim released his 3rd disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ghetto-Classics\/dp\/B000BJ7CCY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ghetto Classics<\/a>.  The 1st single was \"Everytime I Think About Her\" w\/Jadakiss and my other favorites included \"The Chosen One\", \"Like A DJ\", \"Masterpiece\", \"Conversation\" and \"Come Over\".\n\nJust as review \"Musac Critic\" stated, Jaheim's 4th release, \"The Makings Of A Man\" has Jaheim playing it safe for the most part.  The 1st track \"Voice Of R&B\" is an introduction to r&b listeners who may not be too familiar with Jaheim's work outside of the singles that everyone has heard.  The track clocks in at less than 3 minutes and is a short but sweet track for Jaheim fans.  \"Hush\" is produced by R Kelly and has Jaheim describing a situation where he unintentionally started messin' around with a female that he knew was with a guy that he knew.  Jaheim blames it on having a couple of drinks but now that the 1st time was so good, he is trying to figure out how they can keep things going without the guy finding out.  \"Have You Ever\" is right along the lines of \"Fabolous\" as Jaheim is reminiscing to events that happened in the past when he was younger.  You hear the familiar Kaygee sound that you heard on \"Ghetto Love\" as well.  \"Lonely\" has Jaheim employing his own concept to the Bobby Womack classic \"If You Think You're Lonely Now\".  The chrous stays the same but Jaheim adds his own lyrics to the verses and the other parts of the song.  This is definitely one of my favorite tracks on this CD.  \"Life Of A Thug\" will be one of those songs that if you heard Jaheim's 1st 3 CDs that you have heard before.  However, you will still want to listen to the track in its entirety.  He talks about how his dad passed when he was 2 so all that he knew were the streets growing up despite having the guidance of his mom.  My personal favorite track on \"The Makings Of A Man\" is \"Just Don't Have A Clue\".  Babyface shows up to produce a nice midtempo jam using acoustic guitars and various other elements.  Jaheim is trying to tell the lady that he is with that she has no idea about the plans that he has for her in the future as long as she realzies that he should be the one and only one for her.  He states that he is better than the guys that she is use to so she shouldn't be afraid to give her all in the relationship.  \"She Ain't You\" has Jaheim talking about a woman that isn't girlfriend that treats him better than his actual girlfriend does.  He even says that the particular girl's love is like a Bentley Coup and his girlfriend's love is like a Mercedes Benz that's been used.  OUCH!..lol  \"She Ain't You\" is another nice midtempo jam.  \"Never\" is the lead single and serves that purpose well.  Jaheim talks about resisting the temptation of love before because he didn't want to turn in his player card.  However, after meeting this particular woman, that he is ready to burn the infamous black book.  Keyshia Cole, who is 3 singles into her sophomore disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Just-Like-You\/dp\/B000VDDCHO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Just Like You<\/a>, joins Jaheim on \"I've Changed\".  Kaygee employs a nice sample in Atlantic Starr's \"Let's Get Closer\" and creates a nice uptempo jam for the prince and princess of \"ghetto love r&b.\"  If you are a fan of either artist then this just might be your favorite track on this CD.  \"What You Think Of That\" is another one of my favorites as Jaheim talks about how his \"Diamond In Da Ruff\" is making him feel.  He's not really caring about what the world thinks about the relationship and he is happy to have her in his life.  \"Make A Wish\" is a midtempo jam that has Jaheim wanting to treat his woman to a nice time since it's her birthday and \"Back Together Again\" is a nice song that talks about how his dad and mom are together again in heaven since they both left the Earth to soon.\n\nIf your purchased \"The Makings Of A Man\" at Circuit City then you were blessed with 2 bonus tracks in \"Roster\" and \"Keep It 100\".  \"Roster\" is the better track as the Kaygee produced track will remind you of \"Just In Case\" from \"Ghetto Love\" and \"Like A DJ\" from \"Ghetto Classics\".  \"Keep It 100\" isn't a bad track, but you will clearly be able to tell why it was a bonus track.\n\nOverall, if this is your 1st introduction to a Jaheim CD, I wouldn't expect you to be a big fan of this CD.  However, if you have followed Jaheim since \"Ghetto Love\" then you will enjoy Volume 4 of Jaheim's ghetto classic series.  He has a nice voice and you already know the type of songs that you are going to get from Jaheim so you shouldn't be surprised by the material.  If you liked \"Ghetto Love\", \"Still Ghetto\" and \"Ghetto Classics\", then you should also own \"The Makings Of A Man\".\n\nJames' Top 5\n\n1) Just Don't Have A Clue\n2) What You Think Of That\n3) Lonely\n4) I've Changed w\/Keyshia Cole\n5) She Ain't You\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\nHush\nNever\nLife Of A Thug\nRoster (Bonus Track)\nMake A Wish","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Placido Domingo is a contemporary phenomenon.  Now at 71 not only is he among the greatest tenors that ever lived, he also has managed to age gracefully, allowing his performances on the opera stage to mature with his voice: the tenor has become the baritone and still stuns audiences with his performances of new roles for the baritone voice.  In addition to that he is now an opera conductor, the administrator of Los Angeles Opera, a humanitarian in his giving of himself and his money to aid victims of natural tragedies, a champion of new music, a supporter of new talent through his Operalia, and still is able to have enough joy to sing the opening salvo for sports events and television appearances. He is a warmly human presence in the world and here he shares that enthusiasm for life and for his fellowmen with a series of popular songs for the people.\n\nThe album could comfortably be called Domingo and Friends as he has invited some popular singers to join him in this tribute to popular music. Among those with whom he sings duets are Josh Groban on `Sous le Ciel de Paris', Susan Boyle on `From this Moment on', his son Placido Domingo, Jr on `What a wonderful World', and others with Harry Connick, Jr., Chris Botti, Katherine Jenkins, Zaz, and Megan Hilty. There is something about Domingo's presence that raises the bar for performance with these popular singers!\n\nMany of the songs are from the movies - `Eternally' for `Limelight', `Come What May' from Moulin Rouge', `Parla pi&ugrave; piano' from `The Godfather', `My Heart Will Go On' from `Titanic', the Jacques Brel classic `Chanson des vieux amants' - while the rest are in several languages and are standards in the repertoire of popular songs, such as `B&eacute;same mucho' `Jalousie', `The Girl from Ipanema' and more. When Domingo sings solo he is in rich full yet deeper voice, remaining the fine musician in this repertoire as he is in opera.\n\nThis is an album for the world and Placido Domingo shares his philosophy and his talent with everyone.  Even the most hardnosed critic would have to agree that this album works on every level!  Grady Harp, October 12","classification":5,"fold":5}

{"text":"This past weekend I saw \"Pitch Perfect 2\" in the theater (more on that later). Having seen the movie leads of course inevitably to checking out the soundtrack.\n\n\"Pitch Perfect 2: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\" (18 tracks; 44 min.) collects the music that you hear in the movie, and pretty much in the order as it appears in the movie. We start off with an pretty hilarious a cappella take on the Universal movie studio fanfare (sung by no other than John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks--Banks of course also directed and co-produced PP2). Next comes the Kennedy Center performance (where Fat Amy suffers a 'costume malfunction' of epic proportions, hence the fitting \"Wrecking Ball\" excerpt). The songs come flying fast and furious. The girls' big rival (the German band Das Sound Machine) certainly give the Bellas a run for their money, I love \"Uprising\/Tsunami\". THE highlight of the movie and this soundtrack is the \"Ripoff\" between the 5 bands (10 songs covered in less than 5 min.--with nonstop energy). Likewise with the Bellas' \"Back to Basics\" medley (5 songs in less than 2 min.). And I kinda like it that they managed to get \"Cups\" into PP2 (albeit it in a 'campfire version'). The Bellas' World Championship Finale gave me goose bumps as I was watching it on the big screen.\n\nIn all, the soundtrack for PP2 is equally as good, if not better, than the PP soundtrack, and certainly more complete (remember the mess that was the original soundtrack for the first movie? of course, that was corrected in later reissued 'deluxe' and 'ultimate' versions). (Not onto this soundtrack are the two or three regular (i.e. not a cappella) songs that primarily play over the end titles.) As to the movie itself, kudos to Elizabeth Banks for delivering a sequel that gives the people\/the fans pretty much exactly what they wanted: more of the same from Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson and the rest of the gang. The screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati this weekend was absolutely PACKED, to nobody's surprise. The audience gave an ovation when the house lights came on as the end titles started to roll. Many of them left right away, and hence they missed a nice little bonus deep into the end titles (no worries, I won't spoil). Meanwhile, if you liked Pitch Perfect, you will love Pitch Perfect 2, both the movie and the soundtrack. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"Bobby V is back with his 5th album, he has been very consistent when it comes to releasing music. Five albums in a seven yr span is a good thing, not to mention the mixtapes he released over the years. I remember seeing a video for his first single, the Lil Wayne assisted \"Mirror\" months ago but it really didn't get much video or radio play. Bobby recently said the radio and other people act different towards him now because hes independent, I agree on what he said because when he was Def Jam\/ DTP they used to play his music all the time,  but that's the politics of the industry.\n\nThe album is good, you got tracks like \"Are you ready\", then there's \"Before You Break My Heart\", where he wants to know what could he do different in the relationship so she won't leave him heartbroken, K Michelle shows up on the x rated \"Put It In\", yall should already know what that song is about Lol, but it works because it doesn't come off as over the top type of song, its more like a making love song. Other songs he shines on are \"Nothing On You\", and \"Save Me from Me\". My problem with the album is the inconsistency, the first half is good but when it gets to \"Tipsey Love\" it starts to slack off, \"Rock Body\" and \"She It All\" are very lackluster tracks and serve as filler plus most of the features give forgettable performances. Missteps aside, Bobby adds another solid album to his discography. 3.5 Stars","classification":4,"fold":5}

That is something today's divas have taken for granted in song. But there are some that haven't been given that credit, past being labeled as a one-hit wonder. Oleta Adams is one of those singers that had made that mark beautifully with one glimmer on the charts with her rendition of the Piano In The Dark Singer, Brenda Russell's song Get Here. The song is definitely one of those that shows strength and beauty with age like a fine wine after years of heart. I still love listening to this song each and every time this comes into heart.

It isn't really about having the time of your life and how nice that was, but rather it's about regrets for having wasted the formative years and ending up in a dead-end job or relationship.

You really can tell the difference--Mike Shrieve was and still is a supurb drummer and made Santana rock out.  The booklet included with this is great with alot of comments from Greg Rolie, the original keyboardist and singer.  The whole Woodstock concert is here--remastered perfectly and very clear with an added unknown song at the end of the set.  The practice sessions before the actual album recording were great-extended songs --sounds great!!!  I highly recommend this 2 CD set for any Santana fan or collector--it is definitely worth it.

The opening track \"A Lifetime Spent\" grabs you immediately with its highs and lows, from exhilaration to reflection.  On \"Prelude to a Lullaby,\" Tina Guo on cello and Christopher Luther on violin give counterpoint to Spaeth's gentle soothing melody.  \"Lullaby for the Mending Heart\" is an impressive piece with its orchestral build.  \"A New Beginning\" is well titled, holding hope high.  \"Amazing Grace\" has such a beautiful melody and exudes strength in the interplay between piano & strings.  \"This Is Our Faith\" with the cello is exquisite piece of music, lovely and touching.  At the end of the final title track when Paul strokes those few strong chords, it resounds with such certainty of spirit that we are left with this breathtaking reverberation in the soul.  \"Redemption\" feels like more than music, it is an experience.

I keep my MP3 download on amazon cloud, and move tracks over to my iPhone for listening during my morning walk. I like that these latest boxes are compilations of many composers, as it offers built-in variety to accommodate my daily exercise routine.\n\nOf the new selections, I didn't care much for the performances of the Sibelius 2 & 5, both featuring the Utah Symphony under Maurice Abravanel. Way too low-key for my taste. As others have noted, the Ives Symphonies are screwed up.

{"text":"I don't know how I missed this album from the So. Cal-based Young the Giant last year, but better later than never I suppose. I stumbled onto this album about a month ago, and I've been playing this a LOT.\n\n\"Young the Giant\" (11 tracks; 51 min.) starts off with \"Apartment\" (which was released as a vinyl single), and it's an okay starter. But then we delve into the meat of the album, with strong tracks following one after another: the guitar heavy \"My Body\" (radio dingle), the melodic \"I Got\" and then \"Cough Syrup\" (radio single), several tracks reminding me of early Coldplay. The near-perfect first half of the album concludes with \"God Made Man\" and \"12 Fingers\", with the latter containing an irresistable sing-along chorus, just beautiful. The second half of the album slows things down a bit at times, although contains several outstanding songs like the epic-sounding \"Garands\". The last 2 tracks of the album \"Islands\" and \"Guns Out\" again remind my of Coldplay era-Parachutes (one of my all-time favorite albums).\n\nIn all, what a fantastic debut album. Dreamy at times, hard charging at times, and always keeping my interest. It would've surely made my \"best of\" 2011 albums had I discovered it earlier. That aside, I had the good fortune of seeing YTG in concert this past weekend here in Cincinnati, and they put on a fabulous 75 min. set, playing many of these tracks, along with a few new ones (can't wait for their next album!). Lead singer Sameer Gadhia is a charismatic performer, and he is surrounded by outstanding band mates. What a great show that was!

After all of the stardom and success in The Partridge Family, he passed away from a broken heart, after his years of battling drug and alcohol addiction, bankruptcy and numerous failed marriages with failing as a father to his children. It is no surprise to me, just like other child stars whom had died early with their deep wounds like Dana Plato & Gary Coleman from Different Strokes that also died from the same, damaged heart. One song that I will always remember of David's from The Partridge Family is really his signature track from the show, I Think I Love You. The song really is a trip back in time to when music and harmony was innocent in the 70's, with so much strife in the world and the beginning off the peace movements of the generation. David really was a blessing at the end, but could have been more if he was on the right path, and not with one that had so much wounds at the end. He will be missed at the innocence that David was.\n\nDavid Cassidy: 1050-2017\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":5}

Though \"Believe\" was a good dance album, it also got tiring very quicky as does \"Living Proof\".\nThe songs are good dance songs my favorite is \"A Different Kind of Love Song\" which is definitely the strongest song on the album and should of been released as the first single in stead of the dismal been believed and done that before \"Song for the Lonely\".\nHowever all the songs sound like the same vain of \"Believe\", and just get tired with the same dancebeats over and over.\nI don't want to sound contradicting here, Cher is good, \"Living Proof\" is a well produced dance piece, however it would do better as a 12 inch vinyl single than 12 different songs.\nThe other strong cuts include \"Rain, Rain\" and \"Love One Another\" which sounds a lot like \"A Different Kind of Love Song\" which is a faster version of \"Song for the Lonely\" which is a slower version of \"Believe\"....Get the picture?\nThere is no new trails taken here, no new ideas, or sounds.  Chers voice always the classic sound that Cher has is always in good form, and Cher is one of the best entertainers of all time, however \"Living Proof\" is just the same old \"Beliefs\".\nCher does dance good, however if you want a really good dance album get Kylie Minoques \"Fever\" which is sizzling hot.","classification":2,"fold":5}

The band was made up of men and women, blacks and whites--also very important (and ground-breaking) at the time.  They had a blend of funk, soul, jazz, rock, and r&b that made for a unique and great sound.  Stewart was a psychedelic soul brother\/preacher--his sermons\/messages were in his lyrics--and he got his message out with some of the funkiest music of the era.  But Stone's music went from the good times\/good vibes (\"Dance To The Music\") in the late 60's, to something darker (\"There's A Riot Going On\") when the good times seemed to evaporate.  But those 6-7 albums were (and are) important, still full of great music.\n\nAnd now with this good sounding, great collection of singles, live tracks, instrumentals, album cuts, and a number of previously unreleased tracks, we have an even better picture of this great band.  Will long time fans quibble about what's here and what's not?  Probably.  After all this time (decades!) fans\/listeners will each hear this music differently depending on when they grew up hearing this music--we're all a product of our time--and that's an important point.  Many people don't care much for mono singles (or albums), and I understand that. But for many people who grew up listening to mono--whether it was listening to the radio or on singles\/albums in their bedrooms--mono is part of their music experience.  So to denigrate music simply because it's in mono form is missing the mark.  It still has musical worth to many people.  As with all art (including music) to each his own is the bottom line.  Inevitably some will take the record label to task (remember the mono sets by The Beatles and Dylan?) for releasing mono tracks--even though they are sometimes different versions and are obviously mixed differently.  I guess the bottom line is that I don't feel rating music lower simply because it's in mono is right.  We all suffer (some more than others) of that \"if I don't like it, it isn't any good\" syndrome.  But that's the wrong approach to art.  But overall, this is one great collection of not only good, but important music.  Stone's music cut across musical boundaries from the very beginning and continued until both he and the band fell apart.  This is actually closer to 5 \"stars\" for being a good overall presentation of the band--both the music and the great booklet.\n\nBeginning with the mixture of styles on \"I Just Learned To Swim\" and \"Scat And Swim\" (both from 1964), you know you're in for some great music.  Listen to the mix of musical styles on songs like \"Let Me Hear It From You\", \"I Remember\", or \"I Know What You Came To Say\".  Or the previously unreleased \"Dynamite!\", with Stone and his band backing singer Johnny Robinson.  Or the live tracks from the 1970 Isle Of Wight Festival.  And check out the instrumental \"My Woman's Head\".  Or listen to the slower tempo of \"I Know What You Came To Say\", with it's beautiful church-style organ.  Or the beautifully arranged and sung \"What's That Got to Do With Me\", recorded during the debut album sessions.  When Stone was asked why he recorded the song he stated \"I just liked the song\".  And when you hear it you'll understand why he said that.\n\nThe singles of well known songs (in mono) are also worth having.  Even the vocally bizarre \"Small Fries\" (recorded by The French Fries) is here in it's mono single version.  As Stone would say about that song--\"Screwing with the tapes, such fun.\"  Hmmm.  As I said previously--to each his own.  But listen to The French Fries' \"French\" version of \"Dance To The Music\", titled \"Danse A La Musique\", a real rarity in the vinyl singles market.  And while this version of the song\/arrangement doesn't sit with the band's best music, it's a fun song to listen to.  But there's so much good\/great music here that it's impossible to cherry pick standout songs.  It's all a mixture of funk\/soul\/jazz\/rock\/r&b and (in the beginning) good times.  Even when things during the later years looked bleak (assassinations of U.S. leaders (black and white), the idea that perhaps drugs weren't a panacea after all, a war that dragged on and escalated, continuing racial\/gender inequality, etc.), the music was still pumping--just a bit darker.\n\nI remember those days and how Stone's (and a few other band's) music reflected the ecstatic good times (when his band's music put a smile on your face), and the darker mood when people realized that music (listen to the group's last couple of albums) and \"good vibes\" weren't going to change the world.  Some people coped, others (like Stone) couldn't or wouldn't.  What a time it was in those heady days!  If you were of a certain age everything and everyone--at least for a few years--seemed so alive with possibilities and change, only to have it all be subsumed when the \"real world\" (getting older\/\"growing up\", school, the draft, drug addiction, marriage, families, a mortgage\/bills to pay, etc.) came calling.  An amazing period that I don't see being repeated any time soon.  How could it?  The timings all wrong.  Rock'n'roll was still relatively new.  People (including musicians) were ready to change things, to explore possibilities.  Teenagers (and others just out of the teen years) were now a large part of the total demographics in America.  And a certain feeling of freedom was in the air if you were a certain age.  And this feeling of freedom could be found just about wherever you looked.  As I said, the timings not right.\n\nThe (30 minutes) bonus disc consists of (except for the previously released \"TV Medley: Sing A Simple Song...I Want To Take You Higher\") unreleased songs like the great \"Saint James Infirmary\", an instrumental from 1968 at the Fillmore East which might surprise some people.  Or the long version of \"Stand!\", with it's great hand-clapping ending.  This extra disc is worth owning--even in light of all the good music on the other four discs.\n\nAesthetically the 10\"X10\" packaging is very nice--from the full color, vibrant graphics (the cover has to be seen for it's full effect) inside and out, to the beautiful 104 page booklet.  The four discs slip into pockets in the front and back covers--beware of scratches and scuffs--and the bonus disc fits inside a separate cardboard  sleeve.  The slightly smaller booklet fits inside a sleeve of the tri-fold outer package.  Fans of the band will really like this booklet.  Besides track-by-track information and quotes from various band members (a nice extra), also included is a timeline, beginning in 1943 with Stone's (real name Sylvester Stewart) birth and ending in 2013 with Stone age 70.  The booklet is literally filled with many rare photographs--in both color and b&w--of the band, album covers, record labels, ads, and other memorabilia.  Check out the photo of a young Sly Stone with The Viscaynes in 1961, or the 1976 photo of Sly as one-man band.  All in all the booklet is informative and just plain cool to look at.\n\nFor fans (like me) who also own the recent expanded editions of those early albums, this is still worth having in your library.  For someone new to this music, this is a pretty good place to start.  But to be honest, if you want a complete picture of the band, you need to own the 6-7 expanded reissues, the 2009 set \"The Woodstock Experience\", and the two volumes (from Ace Records) of Stone's early work--\"Precious Stone\" and \"Listen To The Voices\".  All are full of great, important music from a still relatively underrated artist.  So go ahead--put some Sly And The Family Stone into your life--you can't lose.","classification":4,"fold":5}

{"text":"I have uneven feelings about Jazmine Sullivan's sophomore effort, Love Me Back.\nThe current standard of laptop-style production sounds cheesey  when paired with Sullivan's superior vocal ability. A live studio recording session with real musicians seems more suited for  her misguided and under-used talents. Just on the heels of her 2009 CD Fearless, this release is a rushed ill-conceived effort. It pales in comparison to her CD debut. I think more time should have been devoted in the development of this project.\nThe two single releases off this project, the Grammy nominated, \"Going In Circles\" and \"10\nSeconds\" are the best  tracks. I also favor \"Redemption\" for its' vocal arrangement and storytelling elements. It should be considered as third single release.  But, Sullivan's duet with the popular Ne-Yo is likely to be the third single to garner heavy rotation radio airplay. That song really gets on \"my damn nerves, damn nerves\"!\nToo often today's music results in good voice presented with bad material. I hope Sullivan's future\nprojects will be more creative with time invested. This incomplete and rushed sophomore CD could've been great. But, it is just OK.","classification":2,"fold":5}

{"text":"I plan on going to Ozzfest this year, despite the unusually lackluster lineup (I'm really only going to see In Flames, Mastodon, Rob Zombie, Killswitch Engage, Mudvayne, Maiden, and of course Sabbath), so I've been trying to get into more bands that are on this year's tour. I've heard nothing but good things about Soilwork (this was before this particular album's release), and I knew they were (supposedly) melodic death metal, and being that melo death is more or less my favorite genre of metal I decided I've give them a shot, but I waited for the release of this album, which I had seen advertised, before I actually purchased anything, as I wanted to get this first. That worked with Dark Tranquillity (\"Character\" is a jaw-dropping album), but maybe I should've started with an older release with Soilwork.\n\nAfter all the rave reviews I've seen of their past albums, and simply their label of melodic death, I expected to hear some complex and beautiful music on this album. I really didn't get it. While I'm not saying that Soilwork doesn't have talent, I'm just saying that if they do have it, they're not showing it as much as they should be on this record. The songwriting is bland as can be, like a pop rock record: most, if not all, of the songs are in intro riff, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus formula (with a few exceptions), and most of the riffs are fairly simple and frankly uninspired, not at all melodic death-like. Well, at this point I realize Soilwork, at least on this record, isn't really a melodic death band anymore. While In Flames abandoned their classic melo-death sound long ago, I still believe that they make great, though less complicated and though-provoking, music, \"Soundtrack to Your Escape\" being one of my favorite albums of 2004. But it just doesn't work with Soilwork. I honestly can't listen to this album long without getting bored and putting in something else. Lead vocalist Speed no doubt has a good voice, but it bores me, it just seems too much like something you'd hear on a commercial radio rock album. And I have no problem with clean vocals in metal, but Speed's voice really just doesn't do anything for me. He sings on the majority of the album, but he'll also scream every now and then, but I don't see anything special in that either.\n\nThe main problem with this album is it's just too predictable, too dull, too uninspired, too generic, and way too simple. The album has some catchy tracks (the choruses to \"Weapon of Vanity\" and \"Nerve\" have gotten stuck in my head at random times ever since I first heard them), they just don't stand out too much. If you're gonna be a metal band, you gotta make yourself noticeable and show all the talent you've got, and when you have bands like Mastodon and Children of Bodom to compete with, you've really gotta give it all you got. Maybe I'm just judging too hard, but I've given this album time to see if it grew on me, and I still have the same opinion of it I did when I first heard it. But since I've heard so many good things about their past releases, I'll probably pick one of them up sometime in the future, because I really do want to get into Soilwork before I see them at the `Fest.","classification":2,"fold":5}

However, Hex has an extra talent via the Crow Indians who brought him most of the way back from the dead; he can talk to corpses once he touches them. If Hex can stop the plot, he will be a free man and forgiven his Confederate and murderous bounty hunter sins. So, OK, a pretty good premise.\n\nBut the movie is paced so choppily that its very tough to follow. Both Hex and Turnbull are played in a dry and droll manner, leaving Michael Fassbender to pick up the slack as the sole character to show any sparks. There are some interesting cast members here (Aidan Quinn as President Grant, and both Will Arnett and Tom Wopat are involved), but again, the convoluted script leaves little room for characther development. Megan Fox is here, playing a monochromatic prostitute with a soft spot for Hex. After watching this stillborn mess of a movie, she's probably the only one left who does.","classification":2,"fold":5}
