On Friday, HuffPost's Sam Stein interviewed President Obama, who, when asked about managing stress, said he takes \"the long view.\" It's a perspective we'll need -- combined with short-term political urgency -- if we're going to tackle climate change.

As debate raged in the media about running the horrific photo, there was no argument about whether Europe and the rest of the West could be doing more to alleviate the horrific suffering. Already David Cameron has announced the U.K. will take in more refugees. But the image was a moral challenge to us all. As a tribute in an Australian paper read: \"Rest in peace Aylan Kurdi.

{"text":"This week brought some notable farewells. First, Charlo Greene, a 26-year-old TV reporter in Alaska, won the Internet when she dropped the f-bomb on air and quit her job to work full-time on marijuana reform (she pulled off a rare viral double play when, during an interview on HuffPost Live, she smoked a joint). Making a less theatrical but far more significant exit, Eric Holder announced he is resigning as Attorney General. Of course, Holder has agreed to remain in his post until his successor is confirmed by the Senate -- so, given the current state of D.C. dysfunction, he may be AG for some time to come. Finally, after a series of violent nightmares, the sports world delivered a fairy-tale ending as Derek Jeter capped his legendary career with a storybook walk-off hit in his last game at Yankee Stadium. We offer them all a sincere -- if ill-thought-out -- #LatteSalute.","classification":"POLITICS"}

The combatants on the other coast were less inspiring. On Tuesday, having been outmaneuvered for delegates in Louisiana and Colorado by Ted Cruz, Donald Trump accused the RNC of being \"dirty tricksters\" who should be \"ashamed of themselves.\" The next day, The Washington Post estimated that Cruz will pick up 130 to 170 delegates on a second ballot - enough to potentially deny Trump the nomination. As loudly as Trump complains, it's notable that it's in the most business-like aspects of the campaign -- deal-making -- that Trump is failing. If he can't make a deal with his own party, he'll never get that chance to make a deal forcing Mexico to pay for his wall.

He says he'd consider being his running mate: \"I will be open to any way I can help. I'm not going to say no.\" What stirring statesmanship. But this is not just a test for the GOP. It's also a test for the media, who, as David Roberts writes, is likely to give a very unusual campaign the usual media treatment: \"Trump's obvious unfitness for office -- today widely acknowledged across both parties and in the mainstream media -- will become a partisan observation.\" So, yes, as the media writes about how various Republicans are handling their character test, we need to remember we're facing one ourselves. The most important mistake the media could make now would be to treat this like a normal election, and Donald Trump like a normal candidate.","classification":"POLITICS"}

Further inflaming matters was the way largely peaceful protests of the shooting were met with tear gas and armored vehicles (and the arrest of journalists, including HuffPost's Ryan Reilly). This hyper-aggressive response raised bipartisan alarm about the militarization of America's police forces, which have received $4.3 billion in military hardware -- including 435 armored vehicles and 93,763 machine guns -- since 2006. This arms buildup partially grew out of the War on Drugs, which has largely become a war on young black and brown men; 50 percent of those impacted by SWAT raids are black and Latino. Though Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson helped restore calm to Ferguson by boldly replacing pointed assault rifles with hugs, handshakes and active listening, the simmering issues of race and how we police our communities cry out for a larger national conversation.","classification":"POLITICS"}

But whatever the reason, stress is what a lot of people will be unwrapping this year. Fortunately, much of it is returnable.

Your mind and body -- as well as your family -- will thank you.","classification":"WELLNESS"}

After nine years and 1,447 episodes, Stephen Colbert signed off in appropriate fashion, with Santa, a unicorn, Abe Lincoln, and a chess match with Death. Then, he was joined by dozens of former guests -- including Big Bird, Henry Kissinger, George Lucas, Katie Couric, James Franco, Cory Booker, Willie Nelson, and myself -- for a bittersweet version of \"We'll Meet Again.\" After nearly a decade of Colbert, it's clear that what's truly special about him isn't his amazing wit, incredible timing, or even how staggeringly funny he is; it's his heart.

{"text":"This week, the nation experienced yet another collective shock as a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict an NYPD officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner. As Chris Rock tweeted, \"This one was on film\" -- a nod to the grand jury in Ferguson declining to indict Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown just a week earlier. And on Thursday, the Justice Department released a damning report about a seemingly out-of-control police force in Cleveland (where a police officer recently killed Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old holding a pellet gun). In response to all this, largely peaceful protests have broken out across America. The question isn't just how to police our police. The problem is how to fix a broken justice system that has, for obvious reasons, lost the trust of much of our country. The first step is translating people's anger into political action to reassert accountability and put justice back into the justice system. #BlackLivesMatter","classification":"POLITICS"}

One of the most disgusting slanders by the right against low-income people and especially African Americans is the claim that the subprime collapse resulted from the government pressuring lenders to loan to unqualified borrowers. The vast majority of subprime loans were written by mortgage companies not even covered by federal law.
