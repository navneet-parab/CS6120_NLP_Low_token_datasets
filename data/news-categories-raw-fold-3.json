Sound familiar? Trump's biggest contribution to the discourse might be as a cautionary tale about exhaustion, and the resulting consequences of lack of impulse control.

High levels of unemployment put downward pressure on workers' wages, especially those in the bottom third of the labor force. This means we have a federal budget that limits growth and employment in a way that redistributes income upwards. So, inequality didn't just happen; it was the result of government policy. That is why people who actually want to see inequality reduced, and for poor and middle class to share in the benefits from growth, are not likely to be very happy about President Obama's speech on the topic. His comment about the government being a bystander ignores the real source of the problem. Therefore it is not likely that he will come up with much by way of real solutions.","classification":"BUSINESS","fold":3}

In an interview with HuffPost's Howard Fineman, the Trump campaign manager assures us Trump will show America he can \"fill the chair.\" And that ban on Muslims? \"He's already started moderating on that,\" Manafort said. \"He operates by starting the conversation at the outer edges and then brings it back towards the middle. Within his comfort zone, he'll soften it some more.\" The problem is that softened racism, xenophobia and misogyny are no less dangerous. Though the media, which has already retreated to horserace coverage, won't call Trump out, others will. Sheila Foster Anthony, sister of the late Vince Foster, spoke up about Trump's airing of conspiracy theories about her brother's death. \"It is beyond contempt,\" she wrote, \"that a politician would use a family tragedy to further his candidacy.\" But that's where Trump lives.

First, in Washington, the Iran nuclear agreement cleared its biggest hurdle, as opponents lost a key procedural vote in the Senate. Maybe former Vice President Dick Cheney, whose strong opposition to the deal is among the best arguments for it, provided the winning margin.

As Colbert said, \"I used to play a narcissistic, conservative pundit -- now, I'm just a narcissist.\" But still very, very funny.
