{"text":"Wonderfully atmospheric music, perfect for any contemplative need. I use it for background when I need to get intensely creative at work, though I sometimes end up breaking off to listen hard.\n\nA mixture of achingly beautiful slow string pieces, fingerstyle guitar works, light instrumental poppy pieces and three unexpected breaks - gypsy dance music, Alanis Morrisette's \"Thank U\"  and Nick Drake's \"Pink Moon\". It all works wonderfully. The Tyler Bates tracks feature all sorts of subtle touches to convey a Spanish, Catalonian or Basque feel by turns.\n\nHang on, I forgot that James Taylor's \"Country Road\" is in there too. Also \"Fusco\", a Spanish song credited to Berroguetto. It's a lively song sung to a full rock band backing. Oh, and David Gray's \"My Oh My\" is included.\n\nOh heck, check the track listing for yourself. And while you are at it listen to the samples.\n\nOn the basis of this album I'll be looking for other stuff by Tyler Bates.\n\nThe perfect soundtrack to the film too, which if you haven't seen you should.\n\nDefinitely one of my luckiest finds musically. I put this up with Paul Brady's \"Spirits Colliding\" and Glass Hammer's \"On to Evermore\" in terms of instant and continuing delight based on a chance purchasing whim.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I'll start right off the bat and say AC\/DC Live Special Edition released in 1991 is my all time favorite AC\/DC album, live or recorded, so of coarse this one here was not going to stand a chance of being the perfect 5 star album from AC\/DC, but I still give it a 4 star rating. Like many AC\/DC fans who collect bootlegs from the band, or have rare live tracks in our collections, it's going to be hard for AC\/DC to top a lot of the #1 fav live versions between 1974 and present. But this album is still great for us collectors, even those who have heard these same set-lists a million times before, with a few of the new songs thrown in the mix, but this album has a lively crowed that may not speak English too well, but they do know how to scream and humm along to the tunes, making them unique crowed interaction versions of AC\/DC's classics preformed at River Plate in 2009\/10?\n\nI won't bore you and compare things like \"TNT\" just doesn't sound as good as the live version from 198somethign that was eventually included on \"Backtracks\" etc.. but I will say AC\/DC have still got what it takes to rock your socks off as much as they did a 100 years ago. Kicking off with a great live recording of the new track \"Rock N Roll Train\" and into a classic blazing version of \"Hell aint a bad place to be\" and then onto what is possibly there biggest hit to date, \"Back In Black\" and so forth.\n\nSome reviewers here said if you have heard AC\/DC's previous set lists before, then you have heard it all and they are boring. Well, you will miss out on great new live tracks such as \"Rock N Roll Train\", \"Big Jack\", \"War Machine\" and \"Black Ice\", even tho most of us fans really wished they had preformed other tracks from the Black Ice album like 'spoilin' for a fight' and \"she likes rock n roll\"... and then there is the typical songs of coarse... but what those guys saying it's all been the same, it surprises me AC\/DC didn't take the chance to finally get an official live album version of \"Rock N Roll aint Noise Pollution\" down. What really would have been nice would have been a bonus track of \"High Voltage\" included that AC\/DC subbed in during the Australian and New Zealand tour by popular demand. Just like they included \"Hell aint a bad place to be\" only on the Japan special edition of Live (1991). Oh well, what can you do?\n\nSomething else that makes this album different to other ones is that this whole tour, AC\/DC tuned the guitars downwards a step, giving the songs a new spark of life in a same old song, but with a slightly different sound to what you have always heard. It also seems like Brian Johnson speaks his words more clearly, not sure what, maybe he was schooled on it or the effect of living in American now has rubbed off, but you can clearly understand every word he says and is singing, and there is no question by anyone like \"WTF is he saying?\" not that I ever had trouble understanding him. A few songs spark a little new life to by the way Johnsons sings them, it seems he speaks the words clear and propperlly, and doesn't sing them in a slang term cutting off the g from 'ing' words etc.. I dunno if you care about this or not, but I found it pretty interesting to compare what Brian is doing with the songs now compared to 20-30 years ago. Never diss the man, he is the silent rock n roll god at the top that some people slam as not being Bon Scott, but get over it guys, Bon is gone, and Brian has done a great job keeping AC\/DC at #1 for all these years... compare him to Bon if you want, but Brian had been in the band longer, has not disgraced himself, kept Bons memory alive, and despite what you say, he's a rock n roll god who even on those so called \"bad ac\/dc albums\" (not that I think they're bad at all) those songs are still better than most other groups greatest hits, so lay off Brian, understand he is the singer now, and STOP comparing him to Bon Scott. Bon was great, sure, Brian is different, but he is too great in other ways and deserves more respect then people always showing up on AC\/DC's latest releases and saying \"Bon this, Bon that, Bon would've\"... don't you think Bon is looking down on Brian and smiling at what a fantastic job Brian has done since Bon passed away? If there is an afterlife, both Bon and Brian will remain with the band, because I am convinced Bon would not say \"thanks for takin over, but i'll take it from here\" no, you would have two legends in the drivers seats!\n\nKeep on rockin' \\..\/,","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Reflection Eternal are a duo comprising rapper Talib Kweli and DJ\/producer Hi-Tek, and \"Revolutions per minute\" is the follow-up to their 2000 debut \"Train of thought\". Refreshing lyrics combined eclectic sounds making for one of the best releases this year.\n\nThe sunny \"Back again\" features the breezy vocals of Res singing the chorus. \"Strangers (Paranoid)\" is Dub with a triumphant horn section and features Bun B. The bouncy Doo Wop-style \"Midnight hour\" featuring Estelle and the similarly bouncy \"Get loose\" featuring Chester French will get you moving on the dancefloor.  \"Lifting off\" is languid Jazz\/Funk-inflected as is \"Just begun\" featuring Jay Electronica, J Cole and Mos Def.\n\nSome lyrics touch on real deep issues. The glitchy spartan \"In the red\" finds Kweli rapping \"Shame how our heroes is broke\/We call them stars\/It's because when they falling to Earth\/They falling hard.\" as he talks about his music heroes Michael Jackson and James Brown working till their last day as they were broke.\n\n\"Ballad of the black gold\" talks about exploitation by oil companies and governments, using Nigeria as an example and mentioning the attack on the Ogoni people, the killing of Saro Wiwa, and the resulting militant's kidnapping of oil company workers. \"Never see, happy hungry people that ain't rational, They blastin through the gates and they attack you at the capitol, Run up in your palace, find the heads of state and crack a few\nGet a taste of power then, they become fascists too, The fiscal, conservatives, don't know what they purpose is, Put money on the war then they cut your goods and services\nMurderous corporate monsters is breakin records, Exxon is at 40 billion a year, they rakin in record profits - stop it! How they bankin while the auto industry is tankin? Leadership is sankin, oil pollution in the water stankin, Loyalty, to petroleum royalty spoil the economy, We won't get it poppin 'til we oil free, If you're oil rich then we invadin, They call occupation but we losin jobs across the nation\nDrill baby drill while they make our soldiers kill baby still The desert where the blood and oil spill...\" Pretty apt these days, especially with the BP oil spill imbroglio.\n\nThe soulful \"Ends\" features Bilal, while closing cut \"My life (Outro)\" is sublime with skittery beats.\n\nThis year has seen incredible releases in Hip Hop by The Roots, Nas & Damian Marley, and Big Boi to mention a few. \"Revolutions per minute\" more than lives up to its name.

{"text":"This song begins with a full orchestra playing a classical movie sound track. Drums enter along with an ominous bass synthesizer. It is punctuated by distant bird-like synthesized sounds, along with an odd, semi-guttural synthesized sound. I don't like the last sound as it seems distracting but it only lasts for a minute or less. The orchestra makes an occasional return. In the middle there is a melodic classical piano solo. The drums and bass synthesizers begin again with a return to the opening sequence which is a reprise of the first half. It ends with the return to the piano solo with faint violin triplets (possibly synthesized).\n\nOverall the song has a progressive feel with a bit of techno electronica pop overlay.","classification":5,"fold":0}

To me this is called \"getting your money's worth\" for sure.  No Guts, No Glory is pretty much more of the same to follow up on Runnin' Wild, but if it ain't broke why fix it.  The songs on No Guts, No Glory follow the same basic formula as the ones on Runnin' Wild.  Taking into consideration both releases I would give Runnin' Wild a slight advantage overall, but both are worthy of being in any rock and roller's music collection.  I recommend getting the Special Edition if possible in order to get 5 extra songs (of those 5 extra songs Devil's Child and Loaded Gun are awesome).","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"\"Rumours\" probably forever ruined the old tried and true maxim \"no dating in the band!\" Anyone fed that line today can simply respond, \"yeah, that so didn't work for Fleetwood Mac.\" Arguably, dating, not to mention other things, in the band likely gave Fleetwood Mac an ineffable edge to help them attain unimaginable heights of popular music. An unanswerable question lingers as to how the album would have turned out had the band's relationships not gone sour. No one will ever know, of course. And that's very much OK. Because regardless of the emotional miasma, drama, drugs and whatever else went on, the late 1970s line up of the then nearly 10 year old Fleetwood Mac released a hugely acclaimed, and not often disputed, classic rock\/pop album.\n\nNo doubt the \"real\" rumors in the press and subsequent documentaries detailing the band members' intimacies and the undoubtedly uncomfortable situation surrounding the recording of the album have contributed to this album's staying power. Everyone likes a good drama, after all, especially from a distance. This may have led to the creation of a new recording industy marketing strategy: take a collection of great songs, add interpersonal drama and a mega-hit will result. Struggling band managers may have started complaining \"Hey! Why is no one dating in this band?!? Come on! Start kissing!\" The trick, of course, remains writing a collection of great songs. And without the unquestionably great songs the drama behind the classic \"Rumours\" (spelled in the British manner for obvious reasons) probably wouldn't hold anyone's interest for too long. Many may have come to this album titillated by the drama or mesmerized by the sales figures and ended up staying for a direct emotional connection to the music.\n\nAnd this much hyperbolized, mega-selling, nearly ubiquitous and archetypal album definitely includes plenty of great songs. They mostly speak for themselves. And surprisingly they don't sound bitter or vindictive apart from a lyric here and there. Almost anyone alive and within ear distance of rock and pop radio from 1977 to the present has very likely heard many of these songs willingly or unwillingly. The generations born after the 1960s probably didn't even know that they've actually heard most of this album until they put it on. Likely they repeat, \"Oh yeah, I've heard that one! That's Fleetwood Mac?\" throughout the first listen.\n\nThe album's galloping fade up beginning, \"Second Hand News,\" pulls in helpless cochleas with the distinctive layering of Lindsey Buckingham's vocals and the nearly addictive hooks and catches between the vocals. The brain almost doesn't have time to respond before the vocals begin. The beautiful contrast of \"Dreams\" lets hungry brains know that this album isn't blandly homogenous, but unpredictable and adventurous. And the folk-rocky mostly finger-picked acoustic \"Never Going Back Again\" just adds to the sonorous intrigue. \"Don't Stop\" picks up the pace again which continues through the grinding and angry-without-being-angry \"Go Your Own Way.\" An interlude with \"Songbird\" (the only track recorded in an arena) sets the stage for the poignant and hopeful \"The Chain,\" one of the album's highlights. And that's only the first song of side two, in the language of 33 1\/3 LPs. The rest of the album maintains the momentum, ending with the intense and brooding \"Gold Dust Woman,\" supposedly about the lure of the snort. Only \"I Don't Want To Know\" and \"Oh Daddy\" come close to subpar songs, but only in contrast with the rest of the album.\n\n\"Rumours\" will likely stand for quite some time as one of the pinnacles of 1970s rock\/pop. It still hasn't gone away. Whether future generations not yet emerged from birth canals also fervently embrace it remains to be seen. But rumor has it that they just might.","classification":5,"fold":0}

The song definitely is just as haunting as all of Annie's hits just like she showed it with songs like Walking On Broken Glass and NO More I Love You's. It definitely shows after all this time that Annie still shows it after all these years. I loved how brilliant the song is, and if you have loved Annie Lennox all these years, than you'll love this song.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Okay, so I've listened to Tame Impala's excellent new album Currents several times now. Like everyday, twice a day, since last Friday. I can say very confidently that it's a masterpiece. Kevin Parker has finally decided he no longer has to make albums that sound like they're being performed by a crusty crew of long-haired, bearded psych dudes jammin' on a weed and lager high. He's succumbed to the idea -or realization- that he himself is just as much a producer as he is a singer in a rock band. Since the beginning he's recorded Tame Impala records by himself, with the same old equipment, with the same idea in mind which is writing great, catchy pop songs. But he did so in a way where those songs could still be looked at as a band and not just Kevin Parker. Currents marks the point in Mr. Parker's musical career where he gave in to the idea that he's an amazing studio svengali that can manipulate sound and instrument into something that's both retro and futuristic. He needn't worry about creating the illusion of a \"band\" jammin'. Working with Mark Ronson must've given him the push he needed to fully commit to his studio and songwriting prowess. Sure, a broken heart always helps things along, too. This is his skewered pop epic. Currents is a classic pop record. A classic rock record. It's just a classic.\n\nThe songs? \"Let It Happen\" is a nearly 8 minute kinetic, anxiety-soaked, dance track that pulsates urgency and the vibe of \"when it happens, let it happen.\" There seems to be a million things happening in this song, yet it never feels overindulgent. It seems to encapsulate everything about Tame Impala that I've grown to love about them(or him.) \"The Moment\" could be a b-side from Thriller. I could so completely hear Michael Jackson singing this great track. All the studio trickery with delays, echoes, and ethereal synths are here, but Parker's voice is much more in the center and pulled up for us to hear. It's a much more clear-eyed approach to a Tame Impala tune that we haven't heard before. \"Yes I'm Changing\" is pretty much an all out ballad. A song about coming to grips with the idea we don't always stay the same. People grow apart and that's that. Parker has tinkered with sentiment before, but here he's embracing it completely. \"Eventually\" has an \"It Feels Like We Only Go Backwards\" vibe to it, if you threw in some 80s Genesis on top and coated it with some powdered sugar. One of my absolute favorite tracks is the sublime \"The Less I Know The Better\". For me, this song epitomizes a childhood of sitting in the backseat of my mom and dad's 1984 Honda Accord and those rides being soundtracked by early 80s FM radio. The electric piano, the wurlitzer, the disco-lite beat, and the falsetto are throwbacks to a time in pop music that is looked back upon as cheesy and processed; yet Parker seems to make it relevant and poignant. This song is about as perfect a pop track as they come. \"Disciples\" comes in and out of the speakers in less than 2 minutes but it's classic a classic psych rock guitar track. \"Cause I'm A Man\" is a skewed slow jam. THC-fueled R&B. \"Reality In Motion\" sounds like something Parker may have penned for Melody Prochet but decided to keep it for himself. \"New Person, Same Old Mistakes\" feels like a mantra put to stark pop bliss. It's slow, loping drum beat and intricately placed musical easter eggs make for some great headphone listening.\n\nCurrents does something quite fantastical in that it takes the uncool and makes it cool again. Those cheesy electric piano sounds you heard in Richard Marx songs in the mid-80s? Well they're not cheesy anymore. Kevin Parker takes the uncool and makes it vital. Currents is a pop record from another dimension. A dimension where Kevin Parker co-wrote \"Billie Jean\" with Michael Jackson and smoked up with Alan Parsons. It's one of the best records of the year.","classification":5,"fold":0}

While Beyonce' has had the overexposure, Kelly has had a few rough outings. After Ms. Kelly tanked in 2008, she was dropped from Sony BMG, and unfortunately took her music to the dance club scene and scored a triumph with Love Takes Over. But with all that she decides to give it a go with Motivation, the lead single from her 3rd solo record Here I Am. The song overall isn't really as driven as she could've made it to be. I really didn't feel the drive on the song, and I felt that she needed a stronger edge. While it is a treat for die hard Kelly Rowland fans, it could've had a bit more motivation that what was delivered.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"\"Old Yellow Moon\" is a set that grows on me with each play.  My first impression was that I'd have liked a bit more punch, which has dissipated with each spin.  Rodney Crowell was part of Emmylou's Hot Band.  He's recorded 15 albums since his stint with her in the mid-70s.  Emmylou has continued to be a vibrant artist pushing the envelope recording after recording.  James Burton (electric guitar), John Ware (drums) and Bill Payne (keyboards) were also all part of the Hot Band.  In addition, the disc is produced by Harris' former husband Brian Ahern who produced all of her early Warner Bros. sets.  Several tracks here were written by Hank DeVito who was also a member of the Hot Band including the midtempo opener \"Hanging Up My Heart,\" the set's rhythmic centerpiece \"Black Caffeine\" & the soft reflective title track closer.  Ray Price had a #3 hit in 1958 with Roger Miller's \"Invitation to the Blues\"; in Crowell-Harris' hands, Paul Franklin's steel guitar gives this weathered track a classic country feel with Rodney taking the lead on the vocals.  \"Spanish Dancer\" appeared on Patti Scialfa's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Rumble-Doll\/dp\/B0012GMZP4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rumble Doll<\/a>.  Harris has quite a different feel than Mrs. Springsteen's original and finds wistful gold within the track with Vince Gill on guitar.  Tim McGraw recorded Rodney's \"Open Season On My Heart\"; but Rodney mines the emotions on the track with Emmylou's expressive vocals.  Check out Harris' powerful phrasing on the lyric, \"Here's to the whole thing going south.\"  My favorite track on the set is \"Chase the Feeling\" that Kris Kristofferson wrote and recorded on his&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/This-Old-Road\/dp\/B000E6UKD2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">This Old Road<\/a>&nbsp;CD.  It bounces, coos and has sass.  This set reunites Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell, Brian Ahern and veterans of the Hot Band for a set that has a retro feel, well worth the attention it receives.  Enjoy!","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"This one has to be Alice's most inconsistent albums.  It's material ranges all over the place seemingly in search of a direction, but not really finding one.  Cooper appears on the back cover with slicked back short hair, long sleeved dress shirt and a tie.  A complete 360 from his para military character from his last incarnation on \"Special Forces\".  This is another short one only being around 30 minutes long.  Album sales were close to rock bottom by this time with the album not even charting.  I did hear \"I Like Girls\" on my local AOR station a few times, but that was about it.  Although it gets panned by a lot of Cooper heads, I like a lot of this disc.  You get the feeling that Cooper is just having fun with a lot of this stuff, as much of the album is very light hearted and humorous.  Highlights include \"Zorro's Ascent\" a song about Alice Cooper as Zorro.  How he thought up this one I'll never know, but it is funny and cleaver.  Three songs in the middle all run together \"Adaptable\", \"I Like Girls\", and \"Remarkably Insincere\".  They are all short punchy rock songs with funny lyrics.  \"Tag You're It\" sees Alice as a horror movie director.......or is he really a killer?  This is a great song and harkens back to his \"Welcome To My Nightmare\" days.  \"It Better Be Good\" is another short fun rocker. On the other side of the coin there is some pretty dreadful stuff on this album as well.  \"I Am The Future\" sounds like it is from the cheesy movie soundtrack where it originated.  \"No Baloney Homosapiens\" is, well just look at the title and you can pretty much guess.  \"I'm Alive\" is another clunker that closes out the album.  Alice did not even tour around this album and it came and went pretty quickly.  Still, I like most of it and it is defiantly one of Cooper's most \"fun\" albums.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"As a huge Mahavishnu Orchestra fan, I was pretty excited when I stumbled across this 1975 album, which has been nicely remastered by Columbia.  This album features Jan playing all of the instruments including acoustic piano, Fender Rhodes electric piano, moog synthesizer, Oberheim synthesizer and digital sequencer, Freeman string synthesizer, and mellotron along with a full drum kit.  As it turns out, he is a pretty good drummer.  Steve Kindler provides some violin work here and there, while David Earle Johnson provides percussion on The Animals and Sixth Day People.\n\nThe music on The First Seven Days is a far cry from the full-out rave ups on Mahavishnu albums like Inner Mounting Flame (1971) and Birds of Fire (1973).  Rather, this is a very prog rock sounding album, with loads of synthesizers, European classical influences, rock influences, and with very little in the way of jazz.  In general, the pieces range from quiet piano interludes to heavier tracks that feature the drums (the title track for example).  In general though, all of the tracks are very atmospheric and synth-heavy.\n\nFor those of you that are curious, this album is not an exercise in mere \"blowing\".  Although Jan does flex some Mahavishnu-like muscle from time to time, the pieces are generally carefully composed and arranged, and exhibit a great deal of restraint for somebody with such tremendous \"chops\".\n\nAll in all this album is very highly recommended to prog fans, exploratory Mahavishnu Orchestra fans, and possibly even electronica fans.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Throughout the past several few decades for Disney, they have had excellent movie songs that have really stood the test of time, in regards to the warmth and brilliant heart that have grown with our children, and their children with time and deep beauty that has been magic with Disney for years. That has happened with movies and songs like The Lion King with Circle Of Life, Toy Story with You've Got A Friend In Me, and with Aladdin with A Whole New World. But I was very surprised that instead of a new song for Disney's Finding Dory, they would instead of having something newly written, they would instead choose to do a cover song for the film instead, breaking Disney Tradition overall. When I had heard that Sia would do a rendition of the classic Nat King Cole's song Unforgettable, I found it to be overdrawn, and lacked so much of the heart that was brought out on the song from Nat, and also his recently departed daughter, the great Natalie Cole whom made the song her own 25 years ago. Natalie did more justice to the song than Sia did overall. Sia brought in too much orchestration, without having a lot of the soul and charm the song had for generations already. If you're a fan of Finding Dory, than I suggest you give the song a shot, but otherwise, just stick with the one Natalie and Nat King Cole did that have stood the test of time, and still do today. Maybe she should've had more that brought out on Sia's chandelier.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":0}

His collaboration with Jennifer Warnes which won a academy award for Best Song and a Grammy Award in 1983. It is a lovely romantic ballad that still captures the soul of the heart.

{"text":"My next stop on my tour through Joe Bonamassas catalog is Live from the Royal Albert Hall.  Bonamassas previous live recordings have always raised the bar from his studio albums, and this one is no different.  Almost one third (six of 19) of the songs are from his preceding studio album The Ballad of John Henry.  While I like all of the songs, I would have liked to see Jockey Full of Bourbon added, as it is also great live.  The true high point of the show for me is tracks 5-7.  It begins with the soulful ballads So Many Roads and Stop! which highlight both his ever-improving vocals and masterful playing.  After this, the duet with Eric Clapton on Further On Up The Road showcases two master players from different generations.  Bonamassa acquits himself quite well alongside the legend.  One other aspect that I love about Bonamassa is that he is humble in spite of his great talent.  On Asking Around For You, he shares the limelight with Rick Melick (keys) and Sean Freeman (sax).  The rest of the supporting cast deliver stellar performances too.  Finally, the recording quality on this album is arguably the best up to this point in his recording career.  In short, it is a masterpiece all the way around.  Every Joe Bonamassa fan should have this in their collection.\n\nOverall:  A+","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"When it has came down to the music industry, we really haven't had many artists that have really delivered in the heart well. For Cher, so much of the focus has really been on her music in awhile, since the spotlight has really been on her former daughter Chastity now son Chaz Bono in regards to her transgender surgery to become a man. Sadly though, Cher has been out of the spotlight for awhile, and trying to reclaim it doesn't actually feel like she ignites on her latest song, Woman's World, the lead single from her latest album, Closer To The Truth. I didn't feel the song ignite heart, soul and voice from her, as was the case back when she did Believe back in the 90's, and Song For The Lonely in 2002. It is not a bad song, but a must download for anyone new to what made Cher a legend.\n\nSong: C 1\/2+","classification":3,"fold":0}

There was nothing like him before or since. He was in a class all by himself.

{"text":"It's clearly obvious that no one has ever transformed themselves more or been succesful for as long as the supreme diva herself, Cher.  One Word that means so much.  This latest cd is her best yet.  \"Living Proof\" is the most appropriate title fore Cher shows in this dance-ethrusted cd that she can take on anything in her career and that she is here to stay.\n\"Living Proof\" is defintely the best produced dance cd EVER, with the following tracks...\n\"The Music's No Good Without You\" ~ The First European single, and the most unlike Cher song on the cd.  I you didn't know it was Cher you wouldnt know who it was.\n\"Alive Again\" ~ Cher goes from super vocoded in track 1 to a super powerful voice in track 2.  So powerful that a radio station in Germany has chosen it for their Olympic theme song.\n\"Song for the Lonely\" ~ The first Amerian single and the most meaningful song is also very powerful and unlike Believe has no vocodor (cherbot) recrdings o her voice.\n\"Different Kind of Love Song\" ~ Cher said it herself...its \"Vocoded to DEATH!\" haha...its awesome super dancy..will be big in clubs\n\"Rain Rain\" ~ Smooth Ballad...cuts the dance theme a little,but still miraculousely is dancy?!?!?! Only cher!\n\"Love so High\" ~ Excellent song...has to be heard\n\"Body to Body, Heart to Heart\" ~ Kinda like Dov'e La'`more.  Very latin and very upbeat\n\"Love is a Lonely Place Without You\" ~ Great Vocals, Cher!! Super good song.\n\"Real Love\" ~ Kinda like Believe...very vocoded...excellent\n\"Love One Another ~ Remake of Amber's dance song...very good.  Cher's is far better\n\"You Take it All\" ~ Very slow yet very well produced\n\"When the Moneys Gone\" ~ Great way to end the cd..one of the best songs on Living Proof.\nDont forget Living Proof hits he US Feb 26th!","classification":5,"fold":0}

He had some really great songs before when he did Lego House and The A Team. What I had heard when he released Don't and Sing from the X album, I was thinking he had lost his beloved heart. But his latest song does take him back on solid ground. Thinking Out Loud, the third single from the X album does work better with his simplicity and natural beauty. The song definitely is a much better song than what he had lately came out with. He has the makings in the world of a young John Mayer in his voice and his heart. The song is a better download than his past few songs were. Hopefully, there will be more joy and natural beauty with his work soon.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":0}
{"text":"There is no doubt that the Black Eyed Peas really haven't been able to score the massive success they've had a few years ago with songs like Where Is The Love? and Don't Phunk With My Heart. It has been nearly harder for them since Fergie's solo success with The Duchess. For The Black Eyed Peas latest single, I've Gotta Feeling, the second single from their latest album The E.N.D., it simply shows the group trying to simply try for a much more mature, adult contemporary mix sound to their songs. But sadly, it just isn't a very exciting song, it just doesn't really score at all. I honestly think that Will. I.Am, and company really need to re-evaluate their songs and sounds, and then come back with something that should be more funky and driven, becuase they just don't have the feeling.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":0}

The album cover also put me off a little, because it looked kind of silly. But, it ended up being a lot better than I thought! Yes, this album is actually better than California 37. I even recommend it to people who don't care about pop. The album is consistant throughout, and there is not one bad song on here. Give it All is probably the weakest track, but even that is good. I could go on and on about what makes each song unique.\n\nIf I had to pick my top 3 favorites, then in order from 1-3, they are Wonder What You're Doing For The Rest of Your Life, Angel in Blue Jeans, Just a Memory. Some of the songs, like Angel in Blue Jeans, have silly titles, but they are superb nonetheless. Some even sound silly, like Cadillac Cadillac. Don't Grow up so Fast is the slowest song on the album, and a perfect closer. It sounds like a modern Marry Me.\n\nOverall, should you buy this album? Go for it!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I know I've been hard on Prince's music for years now, but for me, it still stands, even in his unfortunate death, that, beginning with 1996's \"Chaos and Disorder\", all the way through \"HITNRUN Phase Two\", the music died long before Prince did.\n\nWhat I mean by died, is all the torment and wrangling with Warner Bros., home to Prince's music 1978-1996, killed his creative spirit. Now I know there are many out there who will disagree, and that's fine, you can love his post-1996 music all you want, but the fact is, it's just not as memorable as his pre-1996 music. Bottom line.\n\nEach of his post-1996 albums, beginning with the bloated \"Emancipation\" and then \"Crystal Ball\" albums, followed by \"Newpower Soul\" and \"Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\" etc., etc., each album had only a few diamonds the rough. I think \"3121\" might have been his best post-1996 work. That album was tight, melodic, and had quite a few memorable tracks.\n\nSo, I am saddened that this will be my last Prince review, that a great artist was taken so soon, and possibly by prescription opiates (we shall see). So here is his (supposed) final work: \"HITNRUN Phase Two\". It's, unfortunately, just okay. I mean it's not bad, but it's not very memorable either. Prince didn't go out on top, or with a bang, he just kind of coasted out the door. Sure, the musicianship is solid, but that's a given. That's not even the point. The point is, in Prince's enormous catalog of music, will \"HITNRUN Phase Two\" even be remembered? Nope.\n\nThere are a few good songs on her like \"Baltimore\" and \"Big City\", but often this is just Prince fooling around with genres, aping old school rhythm and blues, and not bringing the fire and spirit he once had for music to the table. I just go back to 1995's \"Gold\", which wasn't his best work, but man, listen to \"P Control\" and \"Gold\". Those two songs were great, memorable and melodic songs. I'd easily add them to any hits or best of. \"HITNRUN Phase Two\" doesn't even come close to just those two songs alone.\n\nI have all of Prince's albums 1978's \"For You\" all the way through \"HITNRUN Phase Two\". I think I became a fan of his music in 1982\/1983 when I began seeing the videos for \"1999\" and \"Little Red Corvette\" on MTV (I was 10). So, this is coming from a long time fan, who has begrudgingly bought everything Prince released post 1996 in the hopes that someday the man might return to his former glories, but sadly, that will never be.\n\nI never saw Prince in concert, but I should have. I guess the only thing left to say is: Who will be in charge of his music and legacy? I don't want to see a commercial for Swiffer using \"Kiss\". But, I would like all of his Warner Bros. albums 1978 through 1996 digitally remastered with either b-sides, unreleased tracks, outtakes, etc. Do it up nice. Give it to Rhino Records. Make each album at least two discs, maybe three. Also, I wouldn't mind if you could find all of Prince's videos on YouTube. That would be nice.\n\nThis year has been terrible losing David Bowie and Prince within four months of each other. Also losing Glenn Frey (Eagles), Colin Vearncombe (Black), and Paul Kantner (Jefferson Airplane\/Jefferson Starship). I hope the rest of 2016 is free and clear of any other big names dropping off.\n\nHere's how \"HITNRUN Phase Two\" compares with Prince's other works:\n\n1978 For You: Two Stars\n1979 Prince: Three Stars\n1980 Dirty Mind: Four Stars\n1981 Controversy: Four Stars\n1982 1999: Four Stars\n1984 Purple Rain: Five Stars\n1985 Around The World In A Day: Four Stars\n1986 Parade: Three and a Half Stars\n1987 Sign O The Times: Five Stars\n1987 The Black Album: Three Stars\n1988 Lovesexy: Four Stars\n1989 Batman: Three Stars\n1990 Graffiti Bridge: Three Stars\n1991 Diamonds & Pearls: Five Stars\n1992 0)+>: Four Stars\n1994 Come: Three Stars\n1995 The Gold Experience: Four Stars\n1996 Chaos and Disorder: Two Stars\n1996 Emancipation: Two and a Half Stars\n1997 Crystal Ball\/The Truth: Two and a Half Stars\n1998 New Power Soul: Two Stars\n1999 The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale: Two and a Half Stars\n1999 Rave Un2 The Dawn Fantastic: Two and a Half Stars\n2001 The Rainbow Children: Three Stars\n2003 N.E.W.S.: Two Stars\n2004 Musicology: Three Stars\n2006 3121: Three Stars\n2007 Planet Earth: Two and a Half Stars\n2009 Lotusflow3r: Three and a Half Stars\n2009 MPLSound: Two and a Half Stars\n2010 20Ten: Two and a Half Stars\n2014 Art Official Age: Three Stars\n2014 Plectrumelectrum: Three Stars\n2015 HITNRUN Phase One: Three Stars\n2016 HITNRUN Phase Two: Three Stars","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Not as good as Flick of the Switch or For Those About to Rock, but if you're an AC\/DC fan I still recommend it.  This is probably my least favorite AC\/DC album of the 1980's.

{"text":"Many of these sonatas were written for students of Mozart. These sonata movements are routinely taught to intermediate and early advanced students. Mozart teaches the pianist how to have a lyrical singing line. Smooth even scales have to be mastered. The pedal must not be used too much.  Mozart was a master of variations and improvising at the piano. They were typically written down after he first improvised them before an audience.  This is documented by the variations heard here.  Klien tends to emphasize the sweet lyrical singing side of Mozart and not the drama. More recent recordings have tried to bring out more of the drama and romance of the music. The music is well recorded and the digital transfers are very listenable. For the price this is a fantastic deal.","classification":5,"fold":0}

The `look at me, I'm edgy and need attention' antics of songs like \"Hard\", \"S&M\", and \"Rude Boy\" just undermine a voice that, under the right circumstances with the right lyrics and music, can be quite good (such as \"Umbrella\" or \"Love the Way You Lie\").\n\n  This latest release by her, \"Cheers (Drink to that)\" doesn't even have the negative attention grabbing aspects of those other songs.  It's just really dull and boring.  It uses the \"yeah a yeah\" sample from Avril Lavigne's \"I'm With You\" and plays it over a really droning beat along with Rihanna's disinterested vocals.  In addition, the lyrics tap into such clich&eacute;d `hip' phrases such as `hella good'.  Then it has this really odd interlude where the music cuts out and it sounds like a group of drunks at a bar trying to sing along to the lyrics.\n\n  All in all, this is a very forgettable song.  However, given RiRi's fan base, it will still probably make some noise on the charts.","classification":1,"fold":0}

{"text":"For former Jewel fans who don't like this CD, tough!  I've never heard anything like this, and my friends agree it's great.\n\n\"Stand\" (take a stand) is like some time tunnel idea from when music counted for something, set to a sleazy bar beat that holds the counterbalancing darkness.  We haven't had an artist who could popularize stuff like this in a while.\n\nAnd there hasn't been so much hidden in lyrics since people tried playing Beatles records backwards.  Consider that \"Intuition,\" seems to be \"follow your heart\" inspiration, all mushy stuff you'd be proud to sing in church, when suddenly a stacatto vocal riff breaks in with \"just cash in, sell yourself.\"\n\nThere are two striking examples of subliminal change of the apparent message by the silencing of a \"t\" at the end of a word.  In \"Leave The Lights On\" the rhythm makes it impossible to pronounce the \"t\" in \"can't\" so what we actually hear is \"you can try my love, you can buy my love\" instead of \"you can't buy my love.\"\n\nThe second one is in \"Yes U Can.\"  The first time the \"t\" in \"boots\" does come through, but after that it sounds like \"b\".  This one will get my review censored if I spell it out here, and maybe that's why she wrote the lyrics that way, to get past the WalMart censors?  The albumn does NOT have an explicit lyrics rating.  But the \"boots\" are bumpin'.  Apparently it worked.\n\nRight on, Jewel.  Go for it!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Released in 2010, HELIGOLAND was the first team effort by Massive Attack in over a decade, as the interim 100TH WINDOW was mainly a Robert \"3D\" Del Naja solo effort. With Grant \"Daddy G\" Marshall returning to the project and a vocal contribution by Horace Andy, HELIGOLAND is something of a return to the trip hop form that marked Massive Attack's 1990s triumphs.\n\nBut even if the core band was back together, their work serves only as a basis for a shifting series of guest stars: Tunde Adebimpe of TV On The Radio, Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz, Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star, Guy Garvey of Elbow. Personnel are even borrowed from other trip hop acts, with Tricky's vocalist Martina Topley-Bird on two tracks and guitar from Portishead's Adrian Utley.\n\nI must say that though the guest vocalists entertain, I'm disappointed by 3D and Daddy G's efforts. While on previous efforts Daddy G had quite a punch and 3D had this very effective creepy, threatening delivery, on \"Splitting the Atom\", \"Rush Minute\" they sound tired and their voices are low in the mix. Horace Andy, however, still has a voice as strong as ever and it's hard to believe he was pushing 60 at the release of HELIGOLAND.\n\nSurprisingly, in spite of the humongous cast, the album is pretty cohesive musically. There is nonetheless for me a distinction between tracks that are pretty but inconsequential in a Thievery Corporation sort of fashion, like \"Babel\", and the more substantial efforts like \"Psyche\" and \"Atlas Air\". There are a great many fine moments, though I do feel that Massive Attack is sort of adrift stylistically here. Certainly HELIGOLAND can't compare with the three albums of the 1990s, but it is vastly superior to 100TH WINDOW.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Margo Price's MIDWEST FARMER'S DAUGHTER is hard to describe. Oh, I can gloss it over: traditional country meets 70's folk\/pop meets alternative country, underlaced with a healthy dose of sarcasm and nihilism. It's an album that revolves around looking at the past, and being uneasy about where you currently are. It's an album about resorting to alcohol--and other vices--to deal with the strains of an everyday life, set to acoustic and steel guitars, steady drums, and Price's sweet-n-sour twang.\n\nBut that doesn't capture the feel of the album. There's not a single track here I didn't immediately want to go back and listen to...except maybe \"Four Years of Chances,\" if only because I'd already heard it two or three times in the past couple days (moderation is key to a satisfied life, a lesson Price's characters would do well to learn). Much like the more mainstream Kacey Musgraves (I wince a little at the comparison, though it's somewhat appropriate), Price writes and sings about the seedier side of small town life; or, as she puts it, \"I don't write the s*** that gets bought and sold.\" Here is a singer\/songwriter (and I can't think the last time I described a new artist that way, as though I were talking about Kristofferson or Tom Waits) who knows not only what she wants to say, but how she wants to say it. MIDWEST FARMER'S DAUGHTER is undeniably country; and yet, the fact that it's gotten so much commercial airplay surprises me, because this is an album that has \"underground success\" written all over it. But, hell, if more people convert, maybe Nashville as a whole will start putting out better music. And with that, somewhere, Price is laughing as she sips her whiskey.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I clearly remember in March of 1986 first hearing \"West End Girls\" and thinking, in my 13 year old brain, who is this? I have never looked back. A late entry to the new wave movement of the late 70's\/early 80's, the Pet Shop Boys came along around the time Erasure came along, and together, they have stood the test of time.\n\nI don't understand the negative reviews or the glowing reviews. \"Elysium\" is a solid Pet Shop Boys effort, but it is neither their worst offering or their best offering. Each of their proper albums is pretty good with a few great ones in there.\n\nIt didn't take me very long to like \"Elysium\" at all. In fact, musically, it is similar to 2002's \"Release\" and, yes, 1990's \"Behaviour\". It's not a crime to compare it to those two albums because the truth is, that's what this album is similar to. It seems every decade the boys take time out to make a softer, more reflective and moody album, and \"Elysium\" is this decade's offering.\n\n\"Leaving\" starts the album off in that somber mood discussing a love that has ended but still haunts the protagonist. \"Invisible\" looks at aging and how someone who was once considered the life of the party is now 'invisible' to everyone--much like the duo's career in a way, especially in the U.S. \"Winner\", the first single, is a rousing anthem tailor made for the summer Olympics earlier this year. \"Your Early Stuff\" is a wry and witty look at Pet Shop Boys critics (including their early fans, too, I suppose)--it's not unlike \"Yesterday, When I Was Mad\" from 1993's \"Very\" in terms of sarcastic bite. \"A Face Like That\" is vintage Pet Shop Boys, probably the one track here that most closely resembles something found on \"Please\", \"Actually\" or \"Introspective\". \"Breathing Space\" is just that--a ballad about taking time out in your life to get to that zen place in your mind.\n\n\"Ego Music\" is yet another scathing commentary on today's musical artists and their fake generosity. \"Hold On\" is the Broadway musical track, replete with backing chorus. \"Give It A Go\" is the most unusual track here in that the boys attempt what sounds like a Motown throwback, and I actually liked it--something different, and that's a good thing. \"Memory Of The Future\" is a nice electro number. \"Everything Means Something\" to me, is the weakest track here, but its presence does not detract from the overall feel of the album. Lastly, \"Requiem In Denim And Leopardskin\" is a familiar sounding Pet Shop Boys track that I believe is about the demise of either punk rock or 80's hair bands.\n\nSo, is \"Elysium\" \"Please\", \"Actually\", \"Very\" or \"Bilingual\"? No. Those are their finest works. Is it \"Introspective\" or \"Fundamental\" or \"Yes\"? No. Those are their weakest works. Really, I think it comes closest to \"Release\"--good, a change of pace, but not their best work. At this point, I issue a challenge to the boys--make an album no one would expect--an \"Achtung, Baby\". It's not like you have anything to lose at this point. Everyone knows what to expect now, so throw a curve ball.

This song is about two people who love each other.  \"Talk To Me\" is about the importance of communication and trust in a relationship.  \"Grown Woman\" is another strong track on here.  This is a good song about the strength of a grown woman.  \"Work In Progress\" is my other favorite track.  This track reminds me that everyone is a work in progress. No one is perfect.  This track makes me feel good every time I listen to it.  \"Just Fine\" is an great track to dance and move to.  \"Come To Me\" and \"Hurt Again\" are two relaxing tracks.

What matters is what we believe about ourselves and our God-given abilities. That's what Estelle and Jussie sing about in this song.\n\n\"We all make mistakes. You might fall on your face, but I am a conqueror,\" Estelle sings, and that has to be our mindset. It's not going to come easy, so we have to be willing to fight for our dreams.\n\n\"Everybody's been counting you out, but where are they now,\" the song asks. The answer? \"Sitting in the same ole place, just faces in the crowd.\" So what should be strive to do? \"I rather stand tall then live on my knees,\" says the song. \"I am a conqueror. I won't accept defeat.\"\n\nIf we keep that attitude there is no way we can go wrong.","classification":5,"fold":0}

For many, this is the only Yes song they've ever heard - well, this and \"Owner Of A Lonely Heart\" - but it's arguably the best distillation of everything good about Yes. As was the case with the Doors' \"Light My Fire,\" many of us first heard the edited 45 rpm version back in '72, only to find there was a version twice as long on the album. Come to think of it, \"Roundabout\" dashes through the door \"Light My Fire\" had opened five years previously. Both employ a prominent Classical-sounding organ riff along with Spanish guitar scales. However, next to \"Roundablut,\" \"Light My Fire\" sounds positively earthbound (not that that's a bad thing). Maybe the Doors and Yes should have swapped lead singers, just as an experiment. I can imagine Jon Anderson singing \"The End,\" but I can't imagine Jim Morrison singing \"Roundabout.\" There, have I typed enough words for this to qualify as a review?","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Something More Than Free already has a 5 star rating from 289 voters, but I love the album so much, I want to get my two cents worth on here anyway. If you've listen to Jason Isbell at all, you know that he is an amazing song writer and an even better lyricist. With Something More Than Free, I feel Isbell has taken his game to a new level. Musically, the album runs the gamut from old time country (\"If it Takes a Lifetime\") to pensive, slowed down numbers (\"Children of Children,\" \"To a Band that I Loved,\") to alt country gems (\"How to Forget,\" Speed Trap Town\"). Perhaps even more impressive than Isbell's songwriting abilities, are his lyrics. In the song \"To a Band that I Loved\" he sings \"Somehow you put down my fears on a page, when I still had nothing to say,\" which is how I feel about all of his lyrics. And not just fears, but joy, love, hope, etc. The man is a keen observer of life with an impeccable ability to put into words what it's like to be, at the risk of sounding clich, human. I can honestly say that this album gets more play in my rotation than anything else I've bought in years, and I'm sure if you're even contemplating buying the album, you should go ahead and do it. I don't think you'll be disappointed.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Critics have basically dismissed Kravitz over the years as a recycler of late 60's and early 70's rock and roll. It's true that Kravitz's music has elements of Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, James Brown, Sly And The Family Stone, but he also has some Prince, Little Richard, Living Colour and even Terence Trent D'Arby as well as some Black Crowes. I've like Kravitz from the beginning, and though he is not my favorite artist, I have all eight of his albums, each of which have their own merits.\n\nThat said, \"It Is Time For A Love Revolution\" is pretty good. I normally have complaints about 14 songs being too long, and this is no exception. I mean, Kravitz could have left off \"This Moment Is All There Is\" and \"A New Door\" and been just fine. \"I Love The Rain\" is a third choice for exclusion.\n\nThe album starts strong with \"Love Revolution\" akin to \"Are You Gonna Go My Way\". This is followed by a relatively strong \"Bring It On\" and \"Good Morning\". Kravitz is back again on \"Love Love Love\" and \"Will You Marry Me\". The ballads \"If You Want It\" and first single \"I'll Be Waiting\" are good. The second half of the disc is weaker with three tracks I've already mentioned dragging down the show. However, \"A Long And Sad Goodbye\" is maybe the most interesting song on the disc. I'm not sure if Kravitz is singing about his own father, someone else's father, or just a fictional father. It's one of his most powerfully written songs. Kravitz gets a little Talking Heads' \"Take Me To The River\"-ish on \"Dancin' Til Dawn\". The last two tracks seem to be commentary on the current war situation, which is fitting, since the end of war would be a love revolution.\n\nI've read the other reviews here and disagree with the idea that \"It Is Time For A Love Revolution\" is a return to form or a radical departure from his previous seven albums. To me, this is Lenny Kravitz, just like Captain Crunch is Captain Crunch. Kravitz has been around for 19 years now, and he's an established brand name artist. When I buy his music I expect him to sound like he sounds. Would I mind if he really shook things up and surprised me? Not at all, experimentation is very welcomed. On that note, I will say that Kravitz could stand some experimentation to juice things up a bit. Where's \"Mr. Cab Driver\" or \"Elutheria\" or \"Black Velveteen\" when you need them?","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Sun is in every manner of the word . . . brilliant!\n\nLet me start off this review by saying that I have so far purchased almost all available tracks from Two Steps from Hell and Thomas Bergersen. My review may seem biased, but I assure you. If this talented composer ever released a dud, I would be the first to express my disappointment.\n\nSo it took me a while to write this review because I needed to listen to the album a few zillion times to make sure I was 100% satisfied with my purchase and not just running off the high of a new album.\n\nThe album starts off with Before Time and leads into Creation of Earth and Sun. These three songs are a great way to start off the album and immediately set the stage for what you're getting yourself into. When I listen to the beginning songs I see images of a hero or heroine rising to face a challenge and when the music crescendo's I see the massive obstacle before them in a flash of white.\n\nThe violin which was personally played by Thomas Bergersen leads the symphony in a rousing moment that captures that \"heroic\" feel oh so perfectly. This is the same feeling you'd get from any of their previous albums without feeling like it's been done before.\n\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\nWell Bergersen seems to not be afraid to experiment with different songs and melodies when creating his music. As much as I love Hans Zimmer's work, sometimes the music feels very been there done that, which is understandable considering how many movies he's scored. However, Bergersen somehow manages to find a way to keep his music fresh and new while still capturing the spirit of \"music making you braver.\"\n\nHOWEVER! I do have a few problems with this album. Nothing to knock off the stars, but there were a few songs in here that had me scratching my head.\n\n\"Our Destiny\" felt very much like \"Nero\" from the Archangel album. The piano with the ascending and descending scales just felt all too similar to Nero. It was still a great song to capture the classical feeling of Greecian times, but I couldn't shake that all too familiar feeling.\n\n\"Colors of Love\"  was a song that had great promise in the intro, but once the female vocals came in, I found myself getting very tired of this song. My main problem with this particular track is that the female vocals are WAY TOO REPETITIVE! I feel like I'm listening to the same lyrics being used over and over again with very little variation to the music and instruments. It just keeps looping at different pitches until it drives me completely crazy! Ah well, can't win them all right?\n\nDisliking one song isn't enough to bring down a star rating, and when you have a song like \"Dragonland\" HOW CAN YOU GIVE THIS ALBUM LESS THAN 5?\n\n\"Dragonland\" was the most unexpected song out of this album that completely blew me away. It's started off deceptively simple like \"Fountain of Life\" in the Miracles album. Just a soft piano, some sleigh bells, and a theme that softly repeats. But then some percussion hits and the volume slowly starts to increase. Then the strings arrive and you can feel a very gradual change in the song. The intro continues for some time and then . . . the choir shows up.\n\n\"Dragonland\" quickly escalates into a bombastic soundtrack with a powerful bass, electrifying strings, haunting choir, tribal flute, guitar riffs, and just the most amazing sound you'll hear in this entire album. One listen to this track at full volume is sure to knock your socks off and I'd be surprised if you're not tempted to hit the replay button.\n\nThat track alone easily keeps this album at five stars and makes this song collection an EASY recommendation to buy. It's different, it's inspiring, it's thrilling, and it's well worth its value if you love this kind of music.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Christina Aguilera can definitely sing, we all know that. But her studio albums (at least to this point) have been spaced apart and cluttered with filler and interludes that take away from the overall enjoyment of the album.\n\nBack in 2010, she released Bionic, which was largely experimental and certainly a commercial flop, selling about 300,000 copies to date. Part of the problem with that album was the fact that her voice was buried beneath too many layers of electronica, thus nullifying her best instrument. Another problem was the songwriting of Tricky Stewart, who has been unable to re-create the success of \"Umbrella\" which he wrote for Rihanna half a decade ago. Both those elements are absent here, and Aguilera has taken up much of the songwriting herself with the help of some notable songwriters such as Max Martin.\n\nBy and large, \"Lotus\" works well. It is a step back into the pop she was singing when she was 19, and even though she is now 31 (big difference), she can pull it off because the songs are sensual and sound immediate. They are songs of personal growth and independence. And given the fact that there are a few potential huge hit singles here, this is the appropriate album for Xtina at this point in her career.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Haydn, for all practical purposes, invented the string quartet, and he then went on to establish the quartet as one of the major musical forms down to the present day. He also went on to father the symphony and the piano trio as major classical forms, and he joined with Mozart in establishing the piano sonata. They don't call him Papa Haydn for nothing.\nHaydn composed about 70 quartets, all of them very fine works, and at least half of them are flat-out masterpieces. These quartets are very accessible, inventive and amusing--yet for all their fun and frolic, they also reward close and repeated listening. And now Vox offers us the entire set--24 hours worth of superlative music--in very good performances for $2.99.\nIt took me all of three seconds to decide to buy this comprehensively complete set, even though I already have somewhat less complete sets by the Festitics and Schneider Quartets in my collection. I am listening right now to Haydn's set of six Op. 50 Quartets with the excellent Fine Arts Quartet, and I think these 1966 stereo Fine Arts performances are very fine indeed. What I hear is brisk, alert, songful, good-humored renditions on modern instruments with light vibrato in clear and attractive mid-1960s stereo. The less well known Dekany Quartet--who play about half of the pieces-- is also very good, IMHO. These Vox performances form a kind of middle ground between the Festitics and Schneider sets. The Festitics are a contemporary HIP group who use no vibrato and take all repeats. The effect can be slightly austere. Also, the cello-line sometimes produces a rather boomy effect, at least on my speaker system.\n The mid-1950s Schneiders are very, very beautifully played, but the tempos are slightly slower, and the broader vibrato gives the performances a somewhat more romantic feel. I'm happy to have all three sets, but I won't be suprised if I find myself turning to the happy medium of the VoxBox peformances at least as often as the Festitics and Schneiders. (If decide you want buy these other excellent sets, get them from CDUniverse, where each can be had for $9.99.)\nAll in all, this set is a no brainer among no brainers. See Phil of M's excellent review for more details about the provenance, etc. of the recordings.","classification":5,"fold":0}

She mostly recorded cover versions of recent pop hits.  She often went off-pitch, and sometimes she fell behind (or got ahead of) the beat.  She sang with more vibrato than Tiny Tim, and occasionally she would perform bird whistles.  Of course, the whole thing was a joke by the record company.  It's pretty funny, although it wears a bit thin after a while.  I don't think too many people can take 21 songs by Mrs. Miller!  But if you can't get enough of Mrs. Miller, this is a pretty comprehensive collection.","classification":3,"fold":0}
{"text":"In a nutshell-if you like the original album-you'll really like this new 3 CD edition.  The two discs of alternates and outtakes contain several songs from the original album, plus a number of other period tunes not found on the original album.  Bolin fans are probably aware of the \"Whips and Roses\" set with unreleased (at the time) versions of the tracks found on the extra discs for this release.  All of them are even more proof that Bolin was a true master of the electric guitar.  Similar to the original album, the extra songs are jumping off points for Bolin's guitar to shine.\n\nThe three discs (37,48,39 minutes each approximately) and the booklet slip inside pockets in a quad-fold cardboard holder.  The remastered sound (it's not clear what source tape was used) has cleaned things up nicely, the mix is nice, and there's no compression that ruins the sound.  But in a few spots on the extra discs (using headphones) there's a bit of tape hiss, but nothing that gets in the way of the music.  The booklet (at least for me) is where this edition misses the mark. Instead of an essay on the music and Bolin, the 16 pages contain one page of song info and band credits.  The other 15 pages are instead  filled with dozens and dozens of photos of Bolin.  The only written piece (in the holder) is a few short paragraphs written by Johnnie Bolin about hearing the original album, how glad he is that it's being reissued, and a bit about how his brother went into various studio sessions, and asked if there was anyone who wanted to play on his album.  There's a photo inside the holder that shows Bolin playing left-handed guitar-hmmm-was he ambidextrous or was somebody not paying attention to details?  I could've sworn he was a \"righty\".\n\nThe original album is (arguably) Bolin's finest solo work, and some of his best work ever.  His playing in DEEP PURPLE, ZEPHYR, and THE JAMES GANG had it's points, but it's his work with drummer Billy Cobham (the album \"Spectrum\") that really elevated Bolin's status.  One listen to \"Quadrant 4\" on that album is all the proof you need.\n\nSo now we have this new edition which displays Bolin's talents on the electric guitar-especially when he's given the chance to stretch out a bit.  No matter what the tempo, Bolin was capable of playing something just right, and he seemed to do it effortlessly.  Bolin's workmanlike yet understated vocals, which were nonetheless curiously appealing, set things up for his sometimes extraordinary guitar solos and fills.  His vocals seemed to draw you in and then he'd toss off some great solo that made you sit up and really take notice.\n\nThe band on all these tracks varies somewhat.  With Bolin are David Sanborn-sax, David Foster and Ron Frasen-piano, Jan Hammer-synth (and drums), Jeff Porcaro, Prairie Prince, and Narada Michael Walden-drums, Stanley Sheldon and Paul Stallworth-bass, and Phil Collins, Sammy Figueroa and Rafael Cruz-percussion.\n\nChances are if you're reading this you're familiar with the original album.  No matter what the tempo, Bolin's guitar was the star.  As I said previously-this is a guitar-centric album, with Bolin's understated vocals setting up his amazing guitar work.  Slower tunes like \"Dreamer\" or up tempo burners like \"Marching Powder\" make no difference-he knew just what to play and how far to take his solos.  But the extra tracks-some lengthy-give Bolin a chance to really stretch out and let his guitar roam.\n\nDisc Two begins with an alternate, fiery take of the title track, with Bolin in fine form-his guitar does all the real talking.  The instrumental \"Flying Fingers\" is where things get really interesting.  With just a rhythm section, Bolin unleashes some incendiary playing, with the bass and drums both laying down a solid foundation, while urging Bolin on.  Bolin shows his complete command of his instrument-the individual notes, the various tones, the open spaces-everything comes together perfectly.  And listen to the keyboard work that echoes Bolin very subtly in spots.  This long (16 minutes) track gives Bolin the chance to build the intensity up, and then slow things down-only to build his sound and the intensity up even more to great effect.  Why this (and other tracks) have never been released until now is a mystery.  For Bolin\/electric guitar fans this is a highlight.\n\n\"Cookoo\", another instrumental, has a slight funkiness to it (especially the bass) with Bolin (once again) showing his mastery of the electric guitar.  More so than \"Flying...\", this has the sound and feel of a warm-up jam to get everyone in the groove.  But even here Bolin shows he's full of ideas, and let's his guitar do all the work.  \"Wild Dogs\" (also on the original album) has a typical understated Bolin vocal, but then he unleashes his guitar with some fine restrained playing-until he let's go with fiery runs up and down the fretboard.  This long (13 minutes) version steamrolls along as Bolin tosses off solo after solo that combines flat out rock with just a bit of jazz fusion for good measure.  Wow.  Another highlight.\n\n\"Chameleon\" in contrast to the previous two tunes, shows (initially) a more laid back Bolin, who eases off on the pyrotechnics.  The beginning is closer to jazz\/blues than rock-reminiscent of Stevie Ray Vaughan's forays into jazz\/blues later in his career.  About three minutes in, the tempo shifts up, and Bolin's cleanly picked notes and tone are just right. The shifting tempos give this tune added identity, and at 7 1\/2 minutes long, we get another good look at Bolin's mind at work through his guitar.\n\nDisc Three begins with \"Craze Fandango\", with Sanborn's sax laying down a good groove along with the rhythm section.  This tune is closer to jazz-fusion of the period than rock.  There's still the big tones, but Bolin's cleanly played guitar pushes things close to a fusion sound.  \"People, People\" (also heard on the original album) is fairly similar to the original.  Snatches of sax, echoing Bolin's vocals help this tune along.  The stabs of keyboard work in the background, and the percussionists flesh out this song.  Bolin's guitar is heard here mainly filling in open spots-but he does get off a nice, relatively sedate solo that brings this tune to a close.\n\n\"Smooth Fandango\" is a good example of period jazz-fusion.  The beat, the piano\/synth work, the drumming\/cymbal work, and Bolin's tone and playing are firmly in jazz-fusion territory.  The guitar solo is vaguely reminiscent of Allan Holdworth's early work (SOFT MACHINE)-both in intensity and sound in spots.  \"Marching Powder\" (also on the original album), is in contrast to the preceding tunes, an altogether heavier sound.  But (at 6 1\/2 minutes) the melody, the sax, the bass, the keyboards, and Bolin's pinpoint guitar sound-along with some slight distortion effects-all point to the heavier end of the jazz-fusion spectrum.\n\n\"Homeward Strut\" (from the original album), has a relatively lighter sound, with just a bit of funkiness in the mix to keep it interesting.  This sounds like a period tune, with THE JAMES GANG guitar sound evident in spots.  \"Oriental Sky (Lotus) Instrumental\" winds things up with what sounds like a warm-up jam, or possibly Bolin and the band were working something up to be recorded later.  But that's okay because Bolin simply dominates this tune-playing at high intensity here, playing in a more open style there-and then amping things up even higher.  Another example of Bolin's command of the electric guitar.  In some spots-wow.  In other spots-wow!  A nice ending for this edition (which fades quickly suggesting there's more to this tune) by a true master of the electric guitar.\n\nTo have Bolin's life end the year after this album was originally released, is a tragedy on several levels.  And the extra tracks show Bolin was full of ideas, and was willing to explore them to the fullest.  Can you imagine the music we missed?  Can you imagine (as an example) what Bolin would've sounded like playing (with both players  actually in the studio at the same time to feed off each other's energy and ideas) with Jeff Beck?  But at least we have this new edition that gives us a deeper look into Bolin's music.  And it's well worth hearing.","classification":4,"fold":0}

In the late sixties, I had the good fortune to meet Buck and Don after a life performance I attended. What great guys they were. This CD does them justice. I love it.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"After listening to Taylor Swift's fourth album \"RED\", I conclude that it is her best album.  It is Swift's most diverse, mature, and features the most number of strong songs. The songwriting and production is strong. The themes on `RED' are familiar for Swift: love lost, love found, problems in love.  Except now, they are narrated by an `adult', not a teenager. However, Swift is young at heart and not much different as an adult. A teenager could sing about the same things.\n\nIt's the most diverse album because it features a variety of genres - pop-rock, country, country-pop, pop, and even a touch of dubstep.  It also sophisticated moments and sugary sweet moments.  Contrast the first two singles - the bubblegum pop \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" and pure country ballad \"Begin Again\". Some country fans have complained that the album is too pop and not enough country.  While \"RED\" has the most pop elements of all her albums, it's equally a country album as it is a pop album.\n\nThe album begins with \"State of Grace\", an uptempo, U2-like pop-rock number. Like \"WANEGBT\", \"22\" and \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" are upbeat poppy tunes. \"22\" demonstrates what I said about Taylor being young at heart (\"It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters, and make fun of our exes\").  It shuns bar hopping (\"This place is too crowded, too many cool kids\").  Like \"Begin Again\", \"I Almost Do\" and \"All Too Well\" are beautiful country ballads. The title track \"Red\" is upbeat country-pop track. \"Stay Stay Stay\" and \"Sad Beautiful Tragic\" are nice acoustic ballads.  Rising Brit singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran is featured on \"Everything Has Changed\" - a nice collaboration.\n\nAny fans of pop and\/or country (especially fans of both) should check out \"RED\".","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Metallica.  Once brought up into a conversation, two things pop into a mans mind.  One of a historically important Thrash band, that made an impact upon almost anybody who cared to listen, and a historically important band that practically changed their name to Nutallica and also practically sold their souls for money.  Both of these are true, but the first is so fresh and original and important that to this very day, we still love these songs.  The true Metallica last from 1983 till 1991 at best.  Although there are only 8 songs here, they are all of a decently long length and are all so beautiful that you never want them to end.  This was Metallica, not the Metallica of today with 6 minute songs containing stupid lyrics, a trash can and no solos.  After the Black album pay no attention to them,  you'll only be disappointed, but back to this album.  Kill `em All was the beginning of Metallica, and here on their second album, they show growth and maturity as they write more important thing instead of Hit the lights or Whiplash (great songs but not important lyrically speaking).  Almost all of these songs are about Death.  Not death in the sense of Cannibal Corpse's Hammer Smashed Face, but more so in that that each is about a different issue, and makes a point and has something important to say.  With a short break down I'll show what I mean.\n\n1. Fight Fire with Fire 10\/10: one of the best and fastest metallica songs in my opinion.  This one is about Nuclear Warfare\n\n2. Ride the Lightning 10\/10: Beautiful solos, a song that you'll be happy to have stuck in your head.  This one is about the Electric Chair.\n\n3. For Whom the Bell Tolls 10\/10: slower, but one of the most important tracks here.  It's about the Spanish Civil war and also has something to do with H.P. Lovecraft, an author whom Kirk has a fascination with.\n\n4. Fade to Black 9\/10: a friend of mine finds this to be relatively boring.  In my opinion you need to be in the right mood for this song.  But when you are in the mood, this song rocks.  It is about Suicide, and from what I understand this song was also controversial because a man killed himself while listening to it back in the 80's.\n\n5. Trapped Under Ice 8\/10: Great song, the solos are great, the atmosphere is great.  It's about, well, being trapped under ice.\n\n6. Escape 8\/10: the only song not about death, more so about escaping from a town that wants you to be a certain way, and therefore rebelling.  Remember, 8\/10 still means good, it's just that track 1-4 are classics.\n\n7. Creeping Death 9\/10: It's told through the eyes of the Grim Reaper.  An all around great song.  I love the middle part.\n\n8. The Call of Ktulu 10\/10: A beautiful instrumental, once again about an H.P. lovecraft story. I actually read this one and it's a good read, very strange.  In my opinion, this is far better than Orion from Master of Puppets, but that's just my opinion.\n\nThere is something about Ride the Lightning that I can not explain with any other record.  It has this strange dusty feeling to it.  When glancing at a copy of it, it appears to be rather old and unused (even a brand new copy).  Popping it into a CD player, the production has this weird dusty feeling to it that has the same feeling.  But when listening to it, it seems like a gem or relic that one has discovered in the attic of an old house.  It has this mystic atmosphere to it that can not be replicated or understood really.  James's voice also has a rough edge to it as well that isn't on other Metallica records.  This is my favorite Metallica record, as I can listen to it from start to finish and NEVER become bored at all.  Anyone who likes metal should have some Metallica in their collection.  I don't consider them to be the best metal band in history, (as a matter of fact I don't give that title to any band) but this is a valuable history lesson from the world of thrash.  Metallica were once great, people listened to metallica for those beautiful solos, for the touching and fun lyrics and song meanings.  But if you want a great drummer than look elsewhere because Lars is easily disposable, and I could name [insert any number here] of drummers that are better than him.  Lars just does enough to get by but he'll still have his moments of talent, though in this present day, I don't think there is a single person who doesn't want to just punch him in the face.  Well enough about this album, just find it, get it in your collection and enjoy.  Hoped this helped.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Originally known as The Detroit Spinners, this group was discovered by Moonglows great Harvey Fuqua around 1960. In fact their very first release \"Thats What Girls Are Made For\" was done in The Moonglows style. The Spinners were signed by Berry Gordy in the early 60's but struggled mightily to find their sound. They released a dozen or so singles before finally hitting paydirt in 1970 with \"It's A Shame\".\n\nConvinced that the group needed to go in an entirely different direction, good friend Aretha Franklin convinced they to leave Motown and sign with Atlantic Records where she introduced them to producer Thom Bell. This was a match made in heaven. And as they say the rest is history. One of their first big records at Atlantic was \"Could It Be I'm Falling In Love\" in early 1973. The song spent 15 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #4 and was a #1 on the R&B charts as well. Great song!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I'm always excited to see that Revocation is putting out a new album because they never disappoint. Great Is Our Sin continues their run of fantastic releases, this being their second effort since signing to Metal Blade Records. Just like on that one, they are continuing to grow their sound, but just a little bit at a time so as not to make any jarring stylistic changes. The main new element here is an increase on, for lack of a better term, clean vocals. The thing is, most of those vocals only sound clean compared to the raspy death metal approach to the rest. It's more of a classic thrash singing style than what you might expect. Tons of bands have those polar opposite vocals of half super-aggressive, half poppy radio cheese. Revocation does nothing of the sort. While there is plenty of melody to be found, this band is about 99% full-on metal, and that other 1% is more proggy than anything. I don't see any point going on about favorite tracks with an album like this. Pick a song, any song. It's awesome. Top-notch technical skills, quirky and unconventional, crisp production, brutal and just plain heavy. Any fan of thrash or technical death metal should love this band.

I get really excited when I get an album from one of my favorite seasoned pop-stars and there are 5 songs that I can actually call gems.  I'm not even sure I have 5 gems from the last 5 Tori albums put together.  As some other reviewers have mentioned this is the album that should've come out in the early 2000's instead of some of the creative misses she put out.  This one seems clear, consistent and inspired.  There's an energy I hear in her voice that just hasn't been present in a while.  Im going to include my breakdown of Gems, Great tracks and finally the songs I skip below:\n\nGEMS:\nWild Way\nOysters\nAmerica\nSelkie\nWedding Day\n\nGreat Tracks:\nUnrepentant Geraldines\nInvisible Boy - Boys for Pele meets Under the Pink.  She sounds magnificent here.\nPromise - I do not enjoy hearing other vocalists on Tori tracks but on this track both their voices come together to make for a beautiful track.\nWeatherman\nTroubles Lament\n\nSkips:\nWhite Telephone To God - Due to its short length, I will consider this an interlude or break so to speak.  This is not my favorite style of sound which Tori has sprinkled throughout her career.  It's almost nursery rhyme like in quality and always a pass for me.  This is least favorite on the album.\nGiant's Rolling Pin - Again, I'd like her to move away from this bee-bop nursery rhyme sound.  These types of tracks take aways from the overall great sound of this album.\nMaids of Elfen-Maire\n16 Shades of Blue\nRose Dover","classification":4,"fold":0}

But I will suggest that the upgrade is definitely worth the very reasonable price.\nThe sturdy box comes with four card, folding CD slips, with cool photos of Merl and Jerry; a substantial booklet of liner-notes by David Gans with more great photos; a little replica of the promotional matchbook for the original LP (no matches; just small pages of blank paper inside); a release themed coaster; small badge bearing the names of the main two heroes in the Keystone Companions story and a poster bearing the event schedule of Keystone in July, '73.\nI highly recommend this definitive edition of these two amazing concerts.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Its a shame Jeff died recently.  This album shows that Jeff had a lot of music left in him.  All songs are covers, but he makes them his own.  Great guitar playing and he selects all types of blues and rock and roll songs.  He is a great guitar player, especially when you consider the way he plays the guitar--on his lap and blind as a bat!!!!!!  Incredible!!!!  Just listen to the way he plays the Neil Young song--Like a Hurricane--the singing and the guitar solos are the best I have heard of this song done by someone other than Neil Young.  You got to have this album if you love Jeff Healey--may he rest in peace up there jamming with Hendrix and Rory Gallagher.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Playing a curious mix of rap, folk and pop, Twenty One Pilots are a band that are impossible to pigeonhole. The opening track on \"Vessel\" bounces back and forth between the rap and the pop in a seamless fashion that is particularly tasty.  \"Ode To Sleep\" sets the tone for the album as it's as eclectic a single as you'll hear from a new band.\n\nI was lured to \"Vessel\" by the single \"House of Gold,\" which sounds more like The Lumineers or Passengers than what comprises the bulk of the CD. Normally that would tick me off, as I'm not a fan of rapping, and had I listened to the samples of the rest of the songs first, I'd probably have skipped the disc. Glad I got tricked, though. The vocoder heavy \"Migraine\" and the more downbeat \"Car Radio\" sink in enough to compensate for any shortcomings. Twenty One Pilots duo Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun know how to couch their way around the laptop rockers and the screamo-emo and make \"Vessel\" a fun listen. If it weren't for the fact that the lead vocals sometimes turn to screams (you're no Roger Daltry, guys), I'd like this a whole lot more.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"I have always known who Jeremih was because his songs play on the radio, but I never have seen a video, read an interview or listened to an album. Listening to his sophomore LP, \"All About You\" helped me familiarize myself with this young man. While I enjoyed this album, it is by no means timeless or excellent. It's a nice listen, though. There are a few obvious influences from The Dream, and some of the tracks, namely the ballads, sound a bit alike. He has a high-pitched singing voice. His voice is good, but he cannot hold a candle to some of his contemporaries vocally. I would put him in a box with Trey Songz and The Dream vocally.\n\nHere we find lots of songs with sexual references, but subject. There are ballads, mid-tempos and fast tracks. The collaborations are few, which is fine. I once heard a person say that too many collaborations means that an artist is afraid to stand on his or her own. \"Down On Me\" is a club banger that features 50 Cent. It was a cool radio song. \"I Like\" is a ballad that he joined forces with Ludacris on. Again, it's a cool radio song, but probably not something most would remember in a year or two. Ludacris does an okay job. X's & O's\" is an okay song with decent production. In this song he is telling his woman that he is so happy to have found her that he has to give her \"X's & O's.\" \"Love Don't Change\" is a great ballad, especially lyrically. He is singing with emotion here.\n\nPretty good album overall. He does a very decent job on his sophomore album.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n1. \"Love All Night\"\n2. \"Love Don't Change\"\n3. \"All About You\"\n4. \"Sleepers\"\n5. \"Down On Me\"","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Blue Merle--file them away in that place in your mind where you put scents long remembered, summer mornings when the roses have been out a little too long and the air is full of their fragrance, lovely and sweet.  This is music to explore, like a boy explores the cliff in the woods outside his house, delighted to find so many things to do and see.  This is music for lakes, and for rivers, and for ice-cream.\n\nMuch has been made of the resemblance between Luke's voice and that of the lead singer of Coldplay.  Indeed, his voice is eerily similar; fortunately, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Chris's voice is emotive and anguished, and Luke's is much the same, which suits this lovely music perfectly. Some might persuasively argue that it would better serve Blue Merle to have a vocalist with a voice more uniquely his own.  While a voice less reminiscent of that of Coldplay might be desirable for some, ultimately, no one can deny the power and maturity with which Luke uses his voice.  Did Chris influence him?  Probably.  There is no crime in that.  Could Luke have chosen to sing in a different style?  Perhaps.  But would that have suited the music as well? Probably not.  I think that he was blessed with a voice that performs well in the style in which he has chosen to use it, and we should be grateful.  Maturity and further listening will probably help to separate the two in our minds as the bands grow in different directions.  Musically, the two bands are not that similar, although there is much to admire in Blue Merle for fanatics of Coldplay.\n\nNow, about the music itself?  At the risk of sounding trite, the  guitars really do shimmer, the banjos sparkle in a setting of solid drumming and inventive bass.  The lyrics are excellent, and reveal more on repeated listening, which is a benchmark which I use to decide who gets my 5th star or not.  The entire album is excellent, no weak tracks, and the more I hear it, the more glad I am to listen to it.  Some might consider it a flaw that there is no one \"stand out\" track--no one track that is so instantly memorable or catchy as to be the obvious single.  But this is not music for singles, a treat to be digested quickly and best given with insulin--it is music for sustenance.\n\nFor fans of Coldplay, John Mayer, Dave Matthews, Counting Crows and Jeff Buckley, this is likely a band to watch and an album to love instantly, suitable to for enthusiastic recommendation to friends.  For fans of the well crafted pop song, this album is reason for excitement as well, especially if you like your pop drenched in complicated guitar work and gilded with a newgrass sensibility.  For everyone else, find out what you are missing.  Blue Merle are worth the ride.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Yo yo ma is a musician of such renown that it is difficult to know where to begin with a review of his latest CD. The title, 'The Arc of Life' is open to personal interpretation, but as defined by Webster's, ' a continuous progression or line of development'. Another interesting note in this Arc is that Yo-Yo Ma's accompanist, Kathryn Stott, has been a part of his musical life for thirty one years. This is a partnership that has grown in this arc of life.\n\nThis CD does begin with birth through adulthood. The CD starts and ends with two different versions of Ave Maria.  Onto other songs that touch the souls of Kathryn and Yo-Yo through their lives, Lullaby, Songs My Mother Taught Me, all fulfill the beginning. Tango Jalousie, Papillon, Five Pieces in the Popular Style, Was It A Dream.  Childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, middle age, and old  age- Apres in reverse, Salut d'Amour, Romance for Cello and Piano, The Swan, The Wounded Heart, and ending with an astounding Louange &agrave; l'&Eacute;ternit&eacute; de J&eacute;sus (from \"Quartet for the End of Time\". Yo-yo Ma tells us that Messaien attempted \"to code divine love, to describe divine love in sound\" within the confines of unimaginable circumstances. Messiaen was a POW in World War II when he composed this music. Listening to this piece is like a reverie of the heart.\n\nThis CD with 19 songs has the ability to bring us home and closer. It is a CD for every mood and everyday. As Yo-Yo Ma says we all have the soundtracks of our life.\n\nHighly Recommended. prisrob 09-25-15","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Ambrosia \"is an American rock band formed in southern California in 1970. Ambrosia had five Top Forty hit singles between 1975 and 1980. The \"founding members included guitarist\/vocalist David Pack, bassist\/vocalist Joe Puerta, keyboardist Christopher North, and drummer Burleigh Drummond, fused symphonic art rock with a slickly produced pop sound. The group was discovered in 1971 by Los Angeles Philharmonic conductor Zubin Mehta, who featured Ambrosia as part of a so-called All-American Dream Concert. However, it took them four more years to get a record contract; Ambrosia was released in 1975 and spawned the chart singles `Holdin' on to Yesterday' and `Nice, Nice, Very Nice.'\"\n\nThese five tracks by Ambrosia give us just some of their best; this is great for casual fans and people just discovering their beautiful music. \"Biggest Part of Me\" was a big hit and it still gets airplay in our times; Ambrosia performs this with a lot of genuine passion and the music fits in perfectly with their vocals--great! \"How Much I Feel\" was another hit for the group and just one listen tells you why; this is a charming tune. \"Holdin' on to Yesterday\" is yet another awesome song by this band and it all holds its own very well. \"Nice, Nice, Very Nice\" is easy on the ear and the track set ends with Ambrosia performing their fine \"You're The Only Woman (You & I).\" Now THIS is great music!\n\nAmbrosia fans should download any tracks here that they don't have already; but as I wrote above this is best geared toward casual fans and newcomers to their artistry. I highly recommend the singularly beautiful music of Ambrosia.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"This is a great collection to play to set the Christmas mood as you decorate the house or bake Christmas treats.\n\n1. The sampler provides a tinkling rendition of \"Joy to the World.\"\n\n2. \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,\" begins as a soft piano version of the classic song, and quickly switches over to a soft and jazzy rendition of the song, that is especially nicely played.\n\n3. The trumpet solo in \"Good King Wenceslas,\" is very soothing.\n\n4. \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day,\" is played with a very soft piano lead that switches to a very magical version of \"Carol of the Bells\" in the middle.  This is a beautiful rendition of \"Carol of the Bells,\" and I found myself wishing it would go on.\n\n5. The \"Jingle Bells\" and \"Jolly Old Saint Nicholas\" is a jazz band medley with the sultry vocals of Beegie Adair.  What a voice!\n\n6. The presentation of \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" from \"The Nutcracker\" is a bit odd.  Imagine the classic tune pressed through a synthesizer with new-age vibes and snare-drum driven percussions added, and you'll have a good idea about this version of the song.  It also stops very abruptly, which is a bit disconcerting because it's such a surreal rendition of the song.  This is the only song in the collection that I didn't love.\n\n7. The introduction to, \"O Tannenbaum,\" sounded a bit like the version of the song played on the Charlie Brown TV special, but it switched over to a soft jazz band version after the first verse.  Included are bass and piano solos backed by soft percussions.\n\n8. \"O Come All Ye Faithful\" is symphonic in style rather than jazzy.  It begins with a swelling chorus and softens, then builds again.  This cycle repeats several times to the end of the song.\n\n9. The song begins as a beautiful piano solo version of the classical tune, \"Deck the Halls.\"  A drum-set lead and jazz-band back-up is added after the first verse, and by the third verse, the soloist takes off on a jazzy improvisation that is very interesting and upbeat.\n\n10. Kathy Troccoli provides rich vocals with a piano accompaniment in, \"Missing You This Christmas.\"\n\n11.  \"Up on the Housetop\" with a saxophone solo is very nicely played.\n\n12. The, \"Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming\" and \"What Child Is This\" medley attributed to Beegie Adair is one of the most beautiful Christmas tunes I've ever heard.  The string solo is hauntingly beautiful.","classification":5,"fold":0}

Like so many other kids who grew up in the 1960's I was completely captivated by the Motown sound while the real afficianados of soul music were groovin' to the sounds of James Brown and Wilson Pickett. Wilson Pickett was a consummate pro who put his heart and soul into every song he ever recorded. In 1963 Pickett met guitarist\/producer Steve Cropper. Most observers would agree that it was Cropper who was largely responsible for launching Wilson's highly successful solo career at Atlantic. Over the next couple of years they would collaborate on memorable tunes like \"634-5789\" and \"Ninety Nine and One Half\".  Another fabulous tune from this period was the 1965 hit \"In the Midnight Hour' which was a monster R&B hit and peaked at #21 on the pop charts.

This album revives all these memories and much more. This is the last time you can hear Pink Floyd, original and in the flesh. Recorded earlier? yes, and well edited by Gilmour and Mason to bring the final true sound of Floyd back to my collection. I own a collection of 6000 CD + and not one album remains on my cd player over 1 or 2 plays. This one's been there for the past 20 replay and continues. To me, nothing comes close if you are a true fan of Pink Floyd and from their generation. Respect. I am speechless","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"If anyone is thinking about purchasing this set--BEWARE--the \"GLUE PROBLEM\"  which others have written about--IS STILL VERY REAL.  I purchased this set in Dec. 2014 from Amazon and out of 6 discs 4 had significant adhesive (from the packaging)  on the edges of the discs.  Needless to say very disappointing.  There's no excuse for this problem to continue.  The band\/manufacturer  should've addressed this problem when it first appeared.  But as of Dec. 2014 no one seems to care if Gov't. Mule fans are buying a defective product.\n\nAnd it's a real shame.  The music is pure Gov't. Mule--great instrumental work, good vocals, good song selection--and with pretty good sound--pure and alive.  It's almost as if you're sitting there for these three gigs with sound so visceral, exciting, and immediate.  If you want this set, the music's great, but it's a crap-shoot as to the \"glue problem\".  I worked very carefully and at length to get the adhesive off the discs and thankfully all 6 discs play fine.  But they're not pristine looking, which is how  I like to keep my music library--after all--it's my money I'm spending.  I expect to receive a quality product which, sadly, this  is not.  Good  luck.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"1971 and the Beatles have broken up.  Most of the world is in mourning. What will we ever do?\nPush the boundaries even further? Sure, why not.\n\nGlam Rock (AKA Glitter Rock) was one of the answers; Bowie, Roxy Music, Sweet, New York\nDolls and Lou Reed (Rest his soul). And in that little sub-genre there is T Rex, originally a folk\nband with two musicians, Marc Bolan and John Peel.\n\n\"Well, you're dirty and sweet...\"\n\nThis is the song that allegedly ended the friendship between Bolan and Peel. Peel did not like\nthe piece and would not speak to Bolan after its release. The song was their biggest hit world\nwide, and it went to number 10 on the Top Singles list in the US for 1972.\n\n\"Well, you're built like a car...\"\n\nA pulsating bass starts out and the drums kick it in, piano keys leads into Bolan's guitar then\nthe horns blow punctuation. Bolan's vocal come in with some rather cryptic lyrics and it all\nflows together, just as it should be, in this vibrating and sensuous song.\n\n\"Get it on, bang a gong, get it on...\"\n\nThis is a fun song to dance and sing to; as it is for musicians to play as well. To be honest I\nhave no idea what some of the lyrics are about. For instance:\n\n\"Well, you're an untamed youth...That's the truth, with your cloak full of eagles...\"\n\nOkay, I suppose one could make an interpretation about the boldness of youth.  But why would\nyou want to do that? Just sing along and dance around with wild abandon.\n\n\"Take me...\"\n\nThis is such a fun song, full of joy, and from my \"interpretation\" it is about raw sex.

{"text":"Elizabeth Cook can sing!!! She has a voice that begs to be heard. This album is not classic country music by any means. She's country rock with a blues beat at times, but not that modern country pop garbage. Her lyrics definitely have a classic country music theme. (Think of the last verse to David Allan Coe's 'You Never Called Me By My Name\". She hits on pretty much all the important topics at once point or another.) But her overall sound is all her own.\n\nCook's doing something really cool here. She's not playing by anyone's rule. She does whatever sound she feel like and she makes it work. This album is well worth checking out.\n\nThere is a ton of energy in this album that's almost held back, so the whole time it feels tense like it's about to explode. It's a really cool feeling. Hopefully that makes sense. If not, listening to it and you'll see what I mean.\n\n Exodus of Venus - WOW! From the very first beat of the song, WOW! You can almost feel yourself at her show with the opening beat of this song setting the tone of the concert. The vocals kick in after about a full minute and then...WOW again! She has got a voice!\n\n Dyin' - Did I mention she can sing? She's doing it again here. Her band is a little more subdued behind her on this track, but with her voice that's not a bad thing as all. The lyrics are amazing too. This whole song is amazing.\n\n Evacuation - This one sounds a little more Southern. Her voice brings in a twang that she doesn't have earlier on the album. This is not a bad thing at all. She sounds even better here. The song is about getting out of Louisiana because a storm is coming. At least that's the overt theme. This one, in particular, has that tense energetic feeling to it that I mentioned above. It's a really cool track.\n\n Dharma Gate - This one is a slow song focused on the vocals. Cook sounds great, but the lyrics didn't really do much for me. Neither did the music behind her. This isn't a bad song, but it's one of my least favorites.\n\n Slow Pain - Now this is how you do a slow song! I feel like I haven't been clear enough how amazing Cook's voice is. This is the perfect track to listen to for hearing how well she can sing. And her lyrics are phenomenal here. It's hard to go a really slow song with this much pent up energy. I don't know how else to explain it. This is a great track!\n\n Straightjacket Love - Her twangy voice is back, almost to bluegrass levels. And she works it!! Once the band starts going on this track it becomes bluegrass rock (Is that a thing? Screw it. It is now.) This song has a unique sound that is amazing. She keeps going back and forth between really slow solos to a really jammin' full band. It's one of the best tracks on the entire album.\n\n Broke Down in London on the M25 - This one is more rock music with country vocals....set in London. (She's doing her own thing, that's for sure.) It's another cool song with a great sound. This is definitely a theme here. We're at track 7 and there's only 1 song I don't like so far.\n\n Methadone Blues - This song is literally about going to a Methadone clinic to get medicine that helps detox from heroine or other opiate drugs. Cook's got a history with drug problems so this one is pretty personal. I've never been a drug addict but I've worked in a Methadone clinic. She definitely captures the overall experience. It's a great song.\n\n Cutting Diamonds - This is one of the more bluesy tracks on the album. Is 'blues rock' a thing? Again, Cook's not playing by anyone else's rules. She's making the sound she wants. She's doing it right. This is a great song. It's about some personal demons that gets pretty deep.\n\n Orange Blossom Trail - This song sound older, if that makes sense. It's a good sound. It's a good mix of county vocals, rock beat, and blues guitar. So it's highlighting everything Cook and her band do well. It's got a great beat to it too.\n\n Tabitha Tuder's Mama - She slows it way down to close out the album. It's a vocal show here with very mild instrumentation. This is a beautiful song that once again really showcases how well Elizabeth Cook can sing. This is a classic county slow song. I know I said at the beginning that she's not classic country, but this track shows she's fully capable of doing it when she wants to.\n\nThe short version here is....go listen to this. Elizabeth Cook is amazing.","classification":5,"fold":0}

This tune may also bring back fond memories of high school dances as it does for me; I remember slow dancing to this with my girlfriend way back when and the memory is a good one.\n\nThe music makes good use of the percussion, brass and more--give this a listen and try telling me that you don't like it!

{"text":"OK, I never saw a record get such divided reviews in the media, I swear.  Only 2 stars in Rolling Stone, People and the Daily News, a B- in Newsday, a B+ in EW.  I collect this band, so I am buying it regardless of what I read, the Target edition with nthe 4 bonus tracks, but one comment that cut through was that the title of the record is an apt description of the music inside...all fog, neon and overblown bombastic bluster but no substance in the songs themselves, and that they have no sense of humour, that they take themselves WAY too seriously, that what they try to communicate through their songs, they have a long way to go, maturity-wise....AND that they don't have a sense of identity with this record, trying on many different styles, many within the same song...for me, that comes across as experimentation...they should WANT to try different things, it's how they grow.\n\nDo you agree with that comment??  I sorta do, but those things are not what attracts me to ID's music...for me, it's their way with cool pop hooks and tuneful vocals, mixed in with a sense of atmosphere and a unique mix of synthpop, arena rock and alt-folk, with layers upon layers of vocals and big drums...I don't know, I find the music unique and pretty cool, and maybe these writers (I write too), their taste is not along the lines of this band, and they seem to have preconceived notions on what this record is like BEFORE they put it on, and they go through each song to see if it matches what they thought it would be...and analyze it TOO closely, tearing them apart, not allowing themselves to enjoy it in any way.\n\nFunny thing is...I am an atheist, I think all religion is bogus and mind control tactics...and these guys all come from a Mormon LDS background, like the Killers do, and for me, THAT \"religion\" is the biggest hoax of all...with Prophet Joseph Smith thinking he was born from aliens...BUT I read that this record's lyrics consists of lead singer Dan Reynolds coming to grips with these issues and starting to feel the same way, and these doubts contributed to how he met his wife, which is pretty cool...but these critical writers think Dan took himself too seriously, too grimly...nothing fun or anything to laugh about...in the vein of U2...preachy Bono...but I disagree...it's one thing to preach and impose...another to doubt and express frustration that the values and ideals he was raised with were all bullcrap...that's a reason to be angry, wasting your life on these things.\n\nAnyhoo, \"I Bet Your Life\" is a great song...kinda Mumford & Sons'ish but with an atmospheric twist, and sampling the others, good to great, and the song they performed in the Target commercial was good too...when I buy the Target version, I will sit with it straight through and update my review...\n\nFor now, 4 stars...","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Let me just start by saying that I absolutely loved every second of 10 Years' debut album, \"The Autumn Effect.\" Although they came off as an obvious Tool\/Perfect Circle wanna-be, they pulled it off nicely. Their ability to write creative hooks with beautiful melodies, and also rock out here and there, made them one of my favorite new bands.\n\nAfter a long wait, we finally have the band's sophomore album, \"Division.\" I wasn't really sure what direction the band would go in order to step up their game, especially since \"Autumn Effect\" sounded more like a 2nd or 3rd album anyway. For the most part, it seems the band has maintained their previous style, but with a few twists here and there. Songs like \"Beautiful,\" \"11:00am,\" \"Russian Roulette,\" and \"Picture Perfect\" easily sound like they could've been on the first album. Then there are songs that are similar, but take on a more typical radio rock sound like \"Actions & Motives\" and \"Just Can't Win.\" Then we have a couple songs that sound completely different like \"Focus\" and \"Proud Of You,\" which are definitely more on the experimental side. On my first 2 listens, I enjoyed the album, but felt that it failed to achieve the same magic as The Autumn Effect.  I kinda felt like they had taken a step towards sounding like everyone else in their genre. But after a couple more listens, you begin to really love all the songs. \"Actions & Motives\" is a good example, I thought it was mediocre at first but now I love it. This has become one of my favorite albums of 2008, but I still don't think it's quite as good as The Autumn Effect.

{"text":"Cher is at it again.  Now nearly 56 years of age, Cher is still fighting the inevitable tide of time.  This time, as with her last \"effort\" \"Believe\", Cher (with platinum hair--will it translate to platinum sales?  I doubt it) continues her foray into the world of trippy dance beats and nuevo-disco stylings as the listener is bombarded with studio wizardry and up-to-date technology (and Cher's unique voice).  The songs (as is usually the case with Cher) are penned by songwriters (i.e., not Cher herself although she did have a hand (ha!) in writing the first \"tune\") and Cher is backed by a slew of competent studio musicians and masterful, clinical, overproduction.  To me, this sounds like technology for technology sake and not for the sake of the music.  On the bright side, it does tend to obscure Cher's questionable \"talent\" somewhat and that can't be all bad.  If you go for dance music, stick with the experts and not some \"artist\" trying to stave off irrelevance.  If you're someone who digs Cher, you'll buy this anyway (and maybe even dance to it--ha ha ha!!!).  The bottom line:  Overproduced dance music that's been done better by many others.  Hippity Hop Dop!!!","classification":2,"fold":0}

{"text":"I can remember owning this album when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?\n\nTo stay on topic with this album, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this album by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.\n\nAfter gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.\n\nOn the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this album 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.\n\nA MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):\n\nI have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.\n\nIf you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as \"You're just jealous!\" or \"I'd like to see you do better!\" or \"How is it in your parents' basement?\" or \"You must jerk off to your computer!\" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:\n\n\"Anyone who doesn't like what I like, and who dares to say that they don't like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!\"\n\nFYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!\n\nIf you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.\n\nTo those of you who would call me \"pretentious\" or \"music snob\" or \"self-righteous\" or \"self-absorbed,\" you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is \"simple,\" (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:\n\n\"Devil's Night Out\" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones\n\"Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols\" by The Sex Pistols\n\"The Essential Heart\" by Heart\n\"Highway To Hell\" by AC\/DC\n\"Meat Is Murder\" by The Smiths\n\"The Strange Case Of...\" by Halestorm\n\"Greatest Hits\" by Tom Petty\n\"Complete Greatest Hits\" by The Cars\n\"Ugly\" by Life of Agony\n\"Remain In Light\" by Talking Heads\n\nAs far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this album used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!\n\nI also wish to point out that arguments such as \"Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!\" or \"You can actually sing along and\/or dance to it!\" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)","classification":1,"fold":0}

{"text":"Five whole years have passed since Down kicked out some new material, as they delivered their third-full-length effort, \"Down III: Over The Under,\" in 2007. In that time, the side-project supergroup -- which is comprised of Pantera's frontman Phil Anselmo, Corrosion Of Conformity's guitarist Pepper Keenan, Crowbar\/Kingdom Of Sorrow axeman Kirk Windstein, Goatwhore bassist Patrick Bruders, and Eyehategod\/Crowbar drummer Jimmy Bower -- have made plans for releasing four E.P.'s. And they have written and recorded the first of these four, 2012's \"The Purple E.P.\" But anybody wondering if that five-year anticipation leading up to this release has made the songs on this six-track short-player sound over-polished\/produced and slick-sounding was sorely mistaken. Indeed, Down are still as brutal and gritty-sounding now as they were when they debuted in 1995.\n\nSure, \"Purple\" does take some adventurous strides, as it is the first ever E.P. to bear Down's name, features some epic track playing times (including three that clock in past the five-minute mark), and it also has the odd keyboard flourish from guest musician Ross Karpelman. So, as a result, it is not this NOLA-based quintet's most experimental offering to date -- as 2002's \"Down II: A Bustle In The Hedgerow\" takes that honor - but it is the second most experimental. Still, it is still packed to the brim with the usual Down goodies: Like godly -- and brutally heavy -- riffs, for one. As such, in the end, \"Purple\" sounds like the perfect follow-up to \"Over The Under.\"\n\nThe short-player kicks off with \"Levitation,\" which is fueled by pounding, crunching, churning, bottom-heavy, Crowbar-style pure doom riffage and densely booming rhythms. Phil's vocals don't even enter the begin until about the two-minute mark, after which he is heard howling is head off -- in that distinctly Phil-esque tone that only he can replicate -- for the remainder of the song's five-minute playing time. Some really tasty and fairly wailing guitar soloing also enters the mix later on. \"Witchtripper\" begins on an experimental note, with a splash of colorful flamenco guitar plucking. This, however, is of course before the massive walls of booming electric guitars come storming in. From there, the track pounds out piles of both abrasively serrated and grinding and hefty, fat, densely chugging licks. Add plenty of steady, grumbling bass lines and Phil's trademark howling wail -- including some simple, yet really memorable choruses -- to the mix and the end result is one of the coolest cuts found on \"The Purple E.P.\" \"Open Coffins,\" however, gives it a run for its money, with its excellent riffing and ominously thunderous rhythms. And this track is especially of note for its bluesy lead runs.\n\n\"The Curse\" is an expansive, six-minute-long epic that ranges from a pretty lengthy and extended harmonic guitar intro to brooding, forebodingly mid-tempo sludge to shredding and fairly wailing guitar soloing. It is a bass-heavy song, too, in that it is long on very heavy, grumbling bass lines. \"This Work Is Timeless\" is a rambunctious, raucously rocking number with a sludgy bass bottom. It is also highlighted by an unusual melodic breakdown, where some unorthodoxly harmonic guitar leads loom overhead. This brief melodic break is soon answered, though, by thunderously heavy, pounding, and deeply grooving guitar licks in the outro. Lastly, \"Misfortune Teller\" is a whopper of a set closer, clocking in at an epic nine-minutes in length. It has the band's usual abundance of heavy, Black Sabbath-derived licks, and Phil's famously constipated grunting and mean, low growls. But \"M.T.\" differs from the rest of the songs because it also boasts a bit of whiney guitar feedback (in its intro), as well as a deeply bullying, rollicking, Southern sludge-filled main groove, and another bout of ripping, winding -- and perfectly harmonized -- guitar soloing.\n\nGranted, it probably should not have taken five years to produce, but \"Down IV Part 1 - The Purple E.P.\" should definitely satisfy all fans of the band and sludge\/doom metal. As previously stated, this is the first in a series of E.P.'s released by Down; and if this E.P. is any indication, the other three (which are yet to come) will all be exceptional, rock-solid releases, as well. Hopefully they will drop sometime sooner than fifteen-years from now.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"When a band's lead singer goes solo, it is usually to express musical ideas different from those of his\/her band.\n\nOpening Brandon Flowers' debut CD is the theatrical ballad \"Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas\" (\"Did nobody tell you, the house will always win\"), not too far in sound from the day job. In fact, the album is produced by Stuart Price who also produced The Killers' last \"Day and age\". Not a bad thing if you, like me, are a fan of The Killers. However, the album is a patchy listening experience. It's filled with ballads, a good number of which are desperately ordinary, not doing justice to Flowers' exuberant voice, (\"Only the young\" for example) and filled with copious mention of angels and demons, salvation, and other vivid biblical imagery.\n\nStill it has its moments; the Countrified \"Hard enough\" is a duet with Jenny Lewis and sounds like Bruce Springsteen, as does the bouncy \"Jilted lovers and broken hearts\". The Country feel is felt also in \"Was it something I said?\" and \"The clock was tickin'\" with spoken Jack White-channeling verses.\n\n\"Crossfire\" is a nice ballad Coldplay or Keane-style, while the hymnal \"On the floor\" is a spare ballad. The midtempo chugging \"Right behind you\" has lovely reverbing guitars. Standout has got to be the Americana \"Playing with fire\" with a bruised Flowers sounding strangled in the wail-like chorus to stunning effect.\n\nI'm a big fan of The Killers and I must say, even their album of B-sides \"Sawdust\" is stronger and more cohesive than this. Still, this has its moments which are very good too. 3 and a half stars!","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Picture this... Paul Stanley has put out a solo album in 2006 and it's .... not all bad news. Playing in a pretty much to  be expected AOR style this disc is blessed by a number of factors. Firstly you sort of know what you are getting and Stanleys' smooth and familiar vox are preaching to the converted here. With little surprise factor to trouble them listeners are free to just let these appropriately simple rock numbers wash over them. Tune after tune here politely does its job, as unambitious as that job may be. And it's hard to argue with the toe tapping results of Wake Up Screaming, Where Angels Dare or nice songcraft such as the bridge of Bulletproof (with non-spectacular solo courtesy of John 5).\n\nProduction by the man himself is warm, non abrasive and in character with the tunes and allows things to breath. The booklet comes with a couple of photos and fully lyrics and each track has individual credits. Of course there are no huge surprises in the lyrics but they are infused with Stanleys irrepressible joy at life and are quite life affirming in a simple and honest manner.\n\nFor all it's easy smile and simple intentions this is not a poor album, but it is in many ways the equivalent of fairly floss. Fun and diverting for a time but ultimately lacking in the `meat on the bone' department required to satisfy any long term hunger.\n\nApproach it for what it is and you'll enjoy it but keep your perspective working.","classification":3,"fold":0}

After \"Babel\" I kind of figured that I had all the M&S that I would need, because their first twenty or so songs sounded so similar, and I knew that a third album of the same sound would be overkill.  I've been pleasantly surprised at this new sound.  Is it derivative of other sounds?  Absolutely--every song we ever hear is derivative of something.  But the band takes us in a different direction here, and it's fascinating to see so many one-star reviews in which people are whining that the band doesn't sound the same as it always has.  For me, this change is very positive, and now I look forward to a fourth album on which the band continues to EXPLORE music, not just put out the same thing every album.\n\nWhat I most like about this album is the way that the new musical sound allows the vocals to be less intense--we're really able to hear the nuances of the lead singer's voice, and he's able to explore his entire vocal range now.  It really works well on this album, and it allows us to see just how talented a vocalist he actually is.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"The Good\n\"Runaround Man\" wastes no time in bringing the power and fury. Lemmy's bass is pumping, Mikkey Dee's drums are pounding, and Phil Campbell's guitar is on fire. \"Teach You How to Sing the Blues\" delivers Lemmy's signature growling vocals. Let's face it, when you hear them, you know it's metal. The track barrels along to a driving chugga-chugga riff. Finally, my favorite college phrase has been immortalized in a Motorhead song. Although the title of the song is \"Rock Out,\" one of the lines in the chorus is 'rock out with your c**k out.' \"Buried Alive\" is just plain brutal. \"English Rose\" delves into the good and bad aspects of a great woman. Motorhead go anthemic on \"Heroes.\" The energy kicks back up with the frantic paced \"Time is Right.\"\n\nThe Bad\nLemmy, you have to give us more than 41 minutes.\n\nThe Verdict\nIf Motorhead is anything, it's consistent. I think Motorizer is their 700th album or something, and it's still just as punishing and full of metal energy that no other band can match. When you think of heavy metal, you should be thinking of Motorhead.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"The Electric Prunes was a group which with a good mix of well-written songs acombined with a garage\/psychedelia sound had a minor breakthrough via the singles \"Too Much to Dream\" and \"Get Me to the World on Time\" in 1966\/67. Both singles were included in this, their debut album. Basically, the group was well preferably a garage band, which producer \/ manager Dave Hassinger gave a modern sound with studio effects much like in the vein of early Pink Floyd on the other side of the Atlantic.\n\nThe band two own original songs on this album \"Luvin '\" and \"Train of Tomorrow\", are  relatively simple garage-rock styled tracks.\n\nMost of the songs are written by female songwriters Annette Tucker, Nancie Mantz and Jill Jones; probably Hassinger had no confidence that the group's own members were ready to deliver songs for an entire album. There is stylistically quite a large difference in these songs that in genre spans the garage rock \/ psychedelia to jazz and music hall. The album has often been criticized for this disparity; but actually the songwriting is so good that you can bear with this lack of obvious direction.\n\nIn addition to the two fine singles worth noting are especially \"Are You Loving Me More,\" \"Sold to the Highest Bidder\" and \"Try Me on for Size\".\n\nThe quaint and very British \"The King is in the Counting House\" has often been cited as an example of a bad song choice. Personally, I think the song is pretty good; but it might as well have been given to a group like Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mich and Tich.\n\nThe group itself was to a higher extent allowed to contribute to the sequel \"Underground\", which may appear more homogeneous, but on the other hand, is falling short on having fewer really good songs.","classification":5,"fold":0}

For R&B singer Tank, he tries a cover and handles it well with his rendition of Bonnie Raitt's I Can't Make You Love Me from his album Now Or Never. The cover is just as simple and intimate of a piano ballad out there. No gimmicks or watermarks, just the feeling of him singing with a piano nicely. I was honestly pleasantly surprised, especially with how simple it matches nearly 20 years since Bonnie Raitt recorded it. I really am eager to hear what Tank does next. Hopefully, he'll score a home run with his next song from Now Or Never.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"I love this band and have for nearly 25 years (since I was in junior high school in 1982--when \"Hard To Say I'm Sorry\" hit the airwaves).  While most artists get some criticism from me if they have too many ballads, this is one band that has been above that because they do the ballad so well.  I love all of their \"second career\" stuff from the 1980s.  I also have gone back to visit their earliest stuff--including listening to and enjoying their debut \"Chicago Transit Authority\" album.  Suffice it to say, I am a fan of all eras of this band.\n\nSo where to place this comeback effort?  After listening to it numerous times, my conclusion is that it nearly stands up to previous material.  I would agree with a couple of other reviewers that a couple of the ballads are a bit sappy even for them, and for sure the song order is strange with having all ballads followed by all uptempo numbers.  I also see no point to having two versions of \"Feel\" on the album--just stick with the trademark horns version.  Still, I am overall very pleased with the release of this album.\n\n\"Feel\" is an enjoyable track (whichever version you listen too)--very familiar but with a sound of modern production.  Good single, although I don't think it did too well chart-wise.  Ballads like \"King of Might Have Been\" and \"Caroline\" would fit right on such Chicago albums as 17-21 with their beautiful vocals and overall melodic sound.  Even the guest vocals on \"Why Can't We\" and \"Love Will Come Back\" are somewhat enjoyable and an interesting direction to take.  \"Long Lost Friend\" is a bit sappy but for sure very pretty.\n\nI agree with those who say the second half of the album comes as a nice surprise in returning to the \"roots\" of the band a bit.  \"90 Degrees and Freezing\" is a catchy, fun uptempo number, and \"Come To Me, Do\" is a vintage-sounding Robert Lamm-sung track.  \"Already Gone\" has some cool harmonies that are not so typically straight-ahead as so many Chicago melodies are.  \"Where Were You\", \"Lovin' Chains\", and \"Better\" are also refreshingly uptempo and a lot of fun to listen to.\n\nSome have called this a \"safe\" Chicago album, and to a degree I agree with that.  Many of the ballads in the beginning certainly fall into a familiar territory we have heard before.  While I have never heard a note of it, I am further intrigued by people's descriptions of the unreleased \"Stone of Sisyphus\" album and would love to have it see the light of day.  I also think of such albums as the amazing one that Toto put out this year and wonder what a Chicago album made in the same vein (i.e., totally doing what they want to do instead of perhaps pining too hard for a return to radio single \"glory days\") might sound like.  All that being said, for me this is overall a very satisfying release.  I have enough criticism here with the song order and \"safeness\" of the album that I can't quite give it a 5-star rating, but it is close.  Call my rating 4 1\/2 stars for an album that should be very satisfying to '80s Chicago fans and also to plenty of career-spanning fans of this legendary band.","classification":4,"fold":0}

There is a splash of many genres of music embedded within that range from electronica sounds to a distorted bass lead and even after a few listens you will hear something fresh.  Unfortunately, I found the backing vocals to border on annoying in that they really sound bored while everything else in the song is popping.  Emphasis on funk, but at times with a heavy shift. The final minute of the song descends into an ever increasing, sampled, distorted mess. Where is the [explicit] warning?  Rounded up to 4 stars.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Even though I've been listening to classical music for over thirty years, I've actually only listened to very little music that was composed prior to the Baroque period. Indeed, except for Beethoven and some Bach, Vivaldi, Handel, Haydn and Mozart; the bulk of my listening pleasure has always been from the Romantic, Late-Romantic and Early Modern periods.\n\nAs of the past year or so, this had changed, as I became very interested in the music of Orlando Gibbons (1583-1625) who lived and worked about a full century before Bach. While I was looking for other composers who were contemporaries of Gibbons, I managed to obtain some useful recommendations on the Amazon's Classical Music \"Discussion Board\". Albeit, my current situation of helping to put adult children through college has me on a tight budget to the point where I can only purchase about one or two CDs per month.\n\nIn this regard, I was delighted to come across the \"Big Choral Renaissance Box\" which is actually a collection of over nine hours of Renaissance, as well as, Medieval choral music.\n\nWhile I haven't yet listened to all of it as of yet, I'm particularly struck by the music of one Guillaume Dufay (1397-1474) who, according to my own bit of informal internet research, was a \"Flemish\" composer. Dufay's music seems to have a purity that strives to organize sound along the lines of an ideal that is both religious, as well as, artistic.\n\nI also listened to Guillaume de Machaut (1300-1377), a Medieval composer whose music reaches for a heavenly ideal but retains a very raw edge of one who might have been a witness to the war and disease of Medieval times.\n\nAs to the rest of this collection, I've skimmed through much of it here and there and have found a lot that I want to explore in greater depth, with a more mindful approach that will allow me to get to know and evaluate each composer individually. Indeed, while it may seem at face value, that much of this music sounds \"the same\"; repeated and patient listening may reveal that the composers of the periods which came before Bach had much personality and creative genius.\n\nWhile skimming through parts of this collection, I did find a couple glitches here and there; but as long you're paying ONE DOLLAR for the whole thing, what is there REALLY to complain about?\n\nOnce again, the \"Bach Guild\" has done it again, and I'd count this collection as one of many great download deals on Amazon.\n\nPeople say that \"you get what you pay for\"...and others say \"What can you buy for a dollar these days?\"\n\nWith this collection, you get much, much more than \"what you pay for\"; a huge return for your dollar.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"There is so much going on with the great Phil Collins right now. Musically, he had been absent from making new music for quite awhile to deal with personal issues from having back surgery to take care of his own needs, after battling problems plagued all the way back to when he reunited to tour with Genesis in 2007. His catalog has also had a very strong makeover, being remastered and re-issued with new music, demos of classic hits and live material that sounds really strong today, like when it did years ago. His career has been really shining again, and his classic songs are also as well worth being rediscovered. I Don't Care Anymore, from his 1982 album Hello, I Must Be Going is a deep driven song from the beat of the drums, which also feels just as much angst and heartbreak from a ended relationship, just as strongly as In The Air Tonight had shown released the year before. It is definitely a song that is worth checking out, even if you had never heard the song the first time it came out years ago. This is a treat for die hard Phil Collins fans, and a good sample for newcomers.\n\nSong: B 1\/2-","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"please understand, that as what I wrote in an earlier review, I believe that there is more than enough room in this world for women who choose to be childfree and those who choose to become and stay mothers  (regardless of their age).  For some reason, I have heard billie jean by Michael Jackson on the radio enough times for the song to grow on me. Im taking it that billie jean by Michael Jackson symbolizes the journey of a man coming to terms with being the father of a woman who became pregnant at an extremely young age (Im guessing a teenager) due to the lyrics she is just a girl. He does not want to believe that he is the father, but he sees that he probably is due to singing about looking at the babys eyes that remind him of his own eyes. From my humble opinion, Billie jean by Michael Jackson still does touch on a relevant issue today because the common societal message that is still being sent is that every woman who is someone becomes a mother, and I do believe that many teenage females subconsciously take in this message and internalize it. I just happen to have made my own decision on what I was going to do after my teenage years when I was tasked with helping my adoptive mother look after the younger children in her care.  I have an open mind when it comes to teenage mothers because I myself was born to a woman who had just turned 16 8 days before my entrance into this world. However, that is all that Im going to say for now for a compelling song that touches on a topic that is not going to go away anytime soon.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"The Fall has been cited as ironically \"the fall\" of the Gorillaz. Both the fan base and Damon Albarn would agree that this is the groups weakest album musically. However, that doesn't mean this is a bad album by any stretch of the imagination. I would argue that this is Gorillaz most ambitious album to date, just for the simple fact that the album's creation was limited at the time of its release. This album was completely composed by Apple iPad music apps. The amount of depth and creativity Damon was able to produce and record off of a simple iPad is truly astounding to me, because despite the album not breaking any new ground sonically, the music on this project is still of high quality. I personally can enjoy this album on its own merit. But when compared to the previous 3 Gorillaz project, it falls short. Because of Damon's choice of using only music apps, the albums sound is not as rich or organic as past albums are. This album has a much more electronic feel than the previous 3 albums and it does suffer for it. The song-writing does not grab your attention as much and the songs aren't nearly as catchy. Its an average project for Gorillaz, but far more creative than most artists can drum up.\n\nFavorite 5\n1) Hillybilly Man\n2) Amarillo\n3) Revolving Doors\n4) Detroit\n5) The Snake in Dallas","classification":3,"fold":0}

The entire film strikes me as a really laughable and poorly acted exaggeration of a play with lots of dancing, jumping around and goofy stage antics (even though I'm aware the actors and singers are acting that way because they're totally into the music, which is awesome).  However if we ignore all that and listen exclusively to the music, you'd find yourself having a total blast with some of these songs.  The best of which is this one, \"You're The One That I Want\".  Simply put, I LOVE THIS SONG!  I have no idea why.  There's no rational reason behind it.  I really shouldn't love it as much as I do.\n\nIn fact when I found out from an oldies radio station that a much younger John Travolta sings it, I nearly got the shock of my life!  But... I give in!  I simply can't resist the jerky rhythm and the *incredible on all kinds of unexplainable levels* way Olivia Newton John sings the verse melody.  I mean she's absolutely ELECTRIFYING!  Oh, and this is without a DOUBT the best example of a song where the verse melody is significantly leagues better than the chorus.  The chorus sounds like a bunch of chickens popping out of their bed and going \"YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I WANT, OH OH OH!\" but the verse... \"You better shape up!  'Cuz I need a man!  Who can keep me satisfied!\"  AWESOME SONG!\n\nI suppose there is one scene I like from Grease.  It's when this song is playing, and John Travolta is so hyperactive over Olivia's dancing moves he's basically rolling around at the bottom of the stairs like a caged monkey that just escaped a lab experiment, haha.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"The Lumineers is one of those bands my wife introduced me to a couple years ago. Initially they didn't sound like they were for me at all. I didn't want to listen to them. That negative attitude of mine lasted until about halfway through the first song of their first album. The Lumineers had me hooked. And I don't mean just my negative attitude about the band changed, I mean any negative attitude I had in general changed. This group has such a soothing sound that their music can LITERALLY change your entire outlook on a day.\n\nTheir second album is a fine follow up. If you liked their first album, you'll like this one. The band has not overhauled itself drastically. The sound you fell in love with on their debut album is back in force on Cleopatra. (The album isn't sad overall. But have some tissues close by before you get to Long Way From Home.)\n\n Sleep on the Floor - Right from the start of the album you feel like it's just the next track off their first album, picking up right where it left off. It's got a background sound similar to Ho Hey that just sounds great. The lyrics are great. The music is great. This first track makes you excited for the 14 right away.\n\n Ophelia - The slight echo they add to the lead vocal track has a neat effect. It's a sad song, but a good one.\n\n Cleopatra - When you name the album after one of the songs on it, you better pick a great song. (So many bands screw this up) The Lumineers did this right. This song is fantastic! It's sweet. It's sad. It's heart warming. It's heart breaking. It takes you on such a roller coaster ride. And the music is stunning!!!\n\n Gun Song - Lyrics can be literal or they can be poetry set to music. They've opted heavily for the poetry choice here. It took me two runs through to really appreciate the lyrics on this one. The la la la la la chorus (literally just says la la la la for like a minute) got a little old. But the lyrics are what sells this song.\n\n Angela - This one is far more literal in it's lyrics. It's a great song about finding your way. Not the best on the album, but great none the less. (That's more of a compliment to the rest of the album)\n\n In the Light - This one is an acquired taste. When it started off I wasn't sure this track was going to be for me. But it's very melodic in its' sound. And the lyrics are spread out, with gaps between stanzas. So you get a lot more of the band's sound on this track, which is not a bad thing. By the end of the song I was enjoying it. It's probably my least favorite track on the album and I still liked it.\n\n Gale Song - You know those songs that are really slow but really powerful and they just make you want to stop what you are doing and concentrate on the song so you can really feel the message? Well....that's what they've done there. This is a powerful song. It really reached me on a deep and personal level. I don't know how The Lumineers can have such a soft instrumental track behind the lyrics and still have that\n\n Long Way From Home - Have tissues close by. Seriously. I'm not screwing around here. I actually needed to take a break from the album after this track to gather myself. It's far and away one of the most touching, most gut wrenching, most tear inducing song I've heard in a LONG time. I both want to hear it 100 more times and never want to hear it again. I am absolutely serious about the tissues. Maybe it's just because I recently went through the scenario described in the lyrics with a loved one...but I don't think so. I think this will touch just about everyone's soul.\n\n Sick In The Head - They pack a lot of strength into this very quiet song. It's all about living your own life as you see fit, not doing what the rest of the worlds tells you to, and not refusing to try things because the rest of the world tells you that you can't succeed. I loved this song.\n\n My Eyes - This one actually has a slightly (emphasis on slightly) different sound than The Lumineers' other stuff. It keeps the album fresh. It's not my favorite. It's not my least favorite.\n\n Patience - This one can be taken literally. It starts off with a piano heavy instrumental track. It's very soft and calming. And I kept waiting for the vocals to start. And kept waiting. And thought \"Maybe I need to be patient\". Then I realized it's an instrumental only track. I wonder if they did that on purpose as a joke? If they did, it made me laugh.\n\n Where The Skies Are Blue - This is all about a guy (or girl) being a better option for someone and reminded that person that he'll (she'll) be there. It's a very simple song but one of my favorites on the album.\n\nEveryone Requires a Plan - Very slow song. Very pretty song. The lyrics are hard to figure out on this one. I've listened to it twice and haven't fully grasped what they are going for. It's a good sound so I'm not minding relistening to it multiple times trying to figure out what they are trying to convey.\n\n White Lie - A very soothing song. Again, not my favorite. The lyrics didn't resonate with me. But the music is beautiful. It's probably my second least favorite on the album and I still enjoyed it. (The bottom 2 songs for me are still good on this album. That's saying something)\n\n Cleopatra (Acoustic Demo) - This is the studio test of Cleopatra, complete with an explanation of the song at the beginning. It's all vocals and a single unplugged guitar for the most part. I think I might hear a piano chime in later. The full release version of Cleopatra is a GREAT song. This is a different view of it.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Rob Thomas is in the top 2 of greatest musical minds today, and with Matchbox 20 he crafted excellent songs, and some of the best melodies and lyrics the world has seen. However, for reasons still escaping me, he went solo, and this song defines his solo work thus far. Now from what I've said so far, you might say, this must be an awesome song, right? Wrong. The problem with the majority of Thomas' solo work is that the music has the ability to soar, the potential, the need and the want to soar, but like a Penguin, it stays on the ground. How this could be, I don't know. Without the song taking off, it ends up a boring lazy mess, that is topped with a chorus that could have been a whole lot better.\n\nOverall, not a great song to say the least. It's radio-friendly (which I cringe to hear it everytime it comes on), it's poorly done, and most of all, it's just flat-out boring. Sorry Rob, you've done better. A whole lot better.","classification":1,"fold":0}

{"text":"Dwight's music is firmly rooted in traditional country, yet makes just enough concessions to progress so that it appeals to a modern generation. I guess a few purists will ignore him, but not many - there aren't many country singers now whose music owes so much to tradition while still selling in large quantities.\n\nThis compilation covers the whole of career to date, including eight tracks from his compilation of eighties hits (Just looking for a hit), eight tracks from his compilation of nineties hits (Last chance for 1,000 years), Things change (from A long way home), I want you to want me (from Tomorrow's sounds today) and two tracks from Population me (Late great golden state, Back of your hand). Thus, there is no new material here, but this compilation is the strongest single CD of Dwight's music so far released.\n\nInevitably, some classic songs have been omitted, one example being The heart that I own. Most of the songs here are originals but Dwight has recorded many fine covers, represented here by Little sister and Suspicious minds (both Elvis Presley) and Crazy little thing called love (Queen).\n\nIf you only want one CD of Dwight's music, make it this one.","classification":5,"fold":0}

She really has not even learned that its takes time to make a good album and a good set of songs, not a rush job. Personally with her going back to Chris Brown after the physical abuse she had suffered is a very bad warning in her as a artist. Her latest song Diamonds is not really as driven as she could have made it, but honestly is at least better than the cheesy ballads she has made in her music like Unfaithful, or the collaboration with Coldplay on Priincess Of China for their Mylo Xyloto album. I think she sounded like she did strain herself in her voice a bit. But the lyrics are definitely starting to be there in her songs. Nevertheless, Rihanna should take more time to find herself as a singer, not the wasted actress in Battleship she threw herself in as a bust.\n\nSong: C 1\/2-","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Karmin's debut single, \"Brokenhearted\", is a very pleasant, enjoyable song.  It's an airy love song about a girl who is waiting for a call from a guy she really likes and had a good time with the night before, but isn't sure if he feels the same way.  Lead singer, Amy Heidemann's sweet vocals helped make the song a winner.  What was interesting, though was her briefly dabbling in a few rap lyrics during the song.  Far from being a gimmick, Amy (who is about looks about as hip hop as Weird Al Yankovic sounds Barry White) actually has quite a talent for rapping.\n\n  In this follow-up song, \"Hello\", her raps make up a much larger portion of the song.  When combined with her edgier singing voice in the lyrics, it feels like a wholly different musical experience.  If your first exposure to Karmin has been to listen to \"Hello\" without even having seen the video, the group would not be as you pictured.  Two good hits already have me looking forward to what Karmin does next.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Since Amazon has lumped the Elektra CD release of this album i must specify which release i am reviewing. I am reviewing the 2000 24 karat Gold CD edition of Ride the Lightening remastered by Steve Hoffman. This is a Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab release just so people know. I own a few of their Miles Davis LP's remasters which sound amazing. Now back on track i have owned and played the hell out of Ride the Lightening (1995) CD put out by Elektra. While that version sounds good the 2000 Hoffman remaster blows any other CD edition out of the water. The album just has more life organic sound and does not sound harsh or filtered. The source material Mr. Hoffman worked on this release with was the original master tapes of the album. While the 1995 CD edition of RTL does not sound much different from the original vinyl version it did go through digital filtering possibly noise reduction and a few other things.  My reason for buying this version was i had heard Metallica had remastered Ride the Lightening again and were releasing a box set for the album. After hearing the sound on the album in that box had fallen victim to the loudness war i searched for an alternative. Snagging a decently priced copy of this long out of print remaster was luck on my part. All i have to say is if you care about sound stay far away from the RTL (2016 box set) it has nice extras which are tempting but yeah this 2000 MFSL Steve Hoffman remaster is the way to go. Best sounding version of RTL in my humble opinion.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"It's a 50th anniversary box set. There's no way that the \"casual Beach Boys fan\" is going to fall in love with all 174 songs on the 6 CDs in this mammoth box set.\n\nBUT...you will find EVERY great Beach Boys track, from their initial \"Surfin' Trilogy\" (\"Surfin'\" \/ \"Surfin' Safari\" \/ \"Surfin' USA\") to the LAST GREAT Brian Wilson-penned Beach Boys track recorded while all three Wilson brothers walked the Earth, \"Sail On Sailor.\"\n\nYour take on what happened AFTER the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Holland\/dp\/B000008DA9\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Holland<\/a>&nbsp;album (1973) is a matter of personal taste. There were moments of fun, maybe moments of genius, but I contend that the LEGEND of the Beach Boys was built on the Brian\/Carl\/Dennis\/Mike\/Al foundation, and THAT'S what this set celebrates at its core. You'll find tracks from the \"Brian Is Back\" era (\"15 Big Ones\" in 1976 through \"The Beach Boys\" in 1985), plus the obligatory \"final hit,\" the Mike Love \/ Scott McKenzie \/ Terry Melcher \/ John Phillips song \"Kokomo,\" as well as a nod to last year's \"reunion\" project,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/That-s-Why-God-Made-the-Radio\/dp\/B007U1FEJE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">That's Why God Made the Radio<\/a>. Add in live tracks, tons of outtakes, and you have pretty much all the Beach Boys music anyone would ever need. You also get the \"lavish packaging\" for those who find that to be important.\n\nEven though the previous box set, 1993's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Good-Vibrations-Thirty-Years-Of-The-Beach-Boys\/dp\/B000002UR4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Good Vibrations: Thirty Years Of The Beach Boys<\/a>&nbsp;had a few GLARING omissions (how could you do a \"definitive\" Beach Boys set and leave off \"Girls On The Beach?\"), it was TIGHTER and CLOSER to something the non-rabid fans would want. There IS NO single (or double) \"best of\" compilation that really captures it all. THIS may be it, the \"one stop shopping\" that offers every significant track in the band's half-Century career. That may be stretching it a bit...MANY fans feel the final curtain came down with the passing of Carl Wilson in 1998, after which a Mike Love and Bruce Johnston \"touring edition\" was assembled and constituted the only way to hear the band until the 2012 reunion, minus Dennis and Carl.\n\nAlso, at the time of the \"Good Vibrations\" box set's release,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Smile-Sessions-2CD\/dp\/B005J29HCQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Smile Sessions (2CD)<\/a>&nbsp;and Brian Wilson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Smile\/dp\/B0002LI11M\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Smile<\/a>...two COMPLETE reconstructions of the legendary \/ mythical lost Beach Boys album...didn't exist. Having \"Smile Sessions\" tracks on THAT set was a draw and a novelty, having them on THIS one is more a matter of \"I already own that.\"\n\nThe one common thread among Beach Boys fans is that there IS no common thread beyond the fact that in early 1960's Hawthorne California, a group of guys got together and changed music forever. You'll find ample evidence of that here.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Barbara Lynn Was a singer\/songwriter\/guitarist from Beaumont, TX, In 1962 her debut single on the Jamie label \"You'll Lose A Good Thing\" raced all the way to #4 on the BIllboard Hot 100 and to the top of the R&B charts. It looked for all the world like a star was born. Unfortunately, although she hit the Hot 100 eight more times over the next several years she could never come close to equaling the success of \"Good Thing\".

Even some of the softer songs are great, such as BURIED BENEATH, THE BEST IS YET TO COME, and the absolutely spine-chilling HYMN FOR THE MISSING, which features some of the most powerful and meaningful lyrics I have ever heard. Overall, RED has made a memorable and satisfying album, even though it does not live up to the standards the last record made, it DEFINITELY isn't bad or mediocre.

Meghan herself addressed this in a recent interview saying that she has always written and loved a variety of musical styles including both pop and rnb and wanted to reflect this in her sophomore release. The witty lyrics and positive messages that define Meghan's sound are still there. I like the fact that there are more upbeat songs and fewer ballads this time around. The song Better was song enough and perhaps really did not need the inclusion of Yo Gotti to it. I Love Me with Lunchmoney Lewis is a good duet and works well.\nIf you really love this album there exists an extended 19 track Japanese edition with features three additional tracks Goosebumps, Throwback Love and her single Good To Be Alive that was on the Peanuts movie soundtrack.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"I really don't understand what it is that some reviewers expect from a Rob Zombie cd. Honestly,he hasn't made a great cd since White Zombie. He disbanded White Zombie at their peak(commercially and musically) and went solo to make even more money with pop sounding White Zombie music. Unlike some reviewers who did not listen to \"Educated Horses\" before they bought it,I did and rather enjoyed it. The first half of the disc is strong and then the cd kind of falls off,but is still as good as any of his previous solo efforts. The biggest problem with Rob Zombie is that all his music kind of sounds the same on each of his solo albums and yes,the discs are way too short(which seems to be the trend lately).This cd isn't close to the most creative music Ive heard and will probably be the last Zombie cd I buy unless there is a White Zombie reunion. However I enjoy listening to it when Im in a Zombie kind of mood. Plain and simple if youve like his solo stuff before,I see no reason why you shouldnt enjoy this cd. If you don't like this cd,you must be getting tired of the same ol' Rob Zombie.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"I have to start with some background on how I got this: I absolutely love Britney's \"Femme Fatal\" album, and of course Ke$ha co-wrote the smash-hit \"Till the World Ends\" from that album. My daughter kept telling me this sumemr \"you gotta check out Ke$ha, you'll love it\", but I never gave it much thought (nor do I listen to mainstream commercial radio). Last month I was visiting Edinburgh, Scotland and there I saw this 2 CD set on sale at a large CD store for such a ridiculously low amount (5 British pounds for the set) that I just had to pick it up, sound unheard. Came home and my daughter suggested I start with the Cannibal CD, and so I did.\n\n\"Animal + Cannibal\" (2 CDs; 26 tracks; 90 min., plus 3 videos) is the combo \"special deluxe edition\" of Ke$ha's 2 albums from last year. \"Cannibal\" (10 tracks; 36 min.) is an incredibly strong collection, with hardly any filler on it. The first 4 tracks \"Cannibal\", \"We R Who We R\", \"Sleazy\" and \"Blow\" are (along with some of Britney's new stuff) some of the most enjoyable and infectuous mainstream stuff that I've heard in a long time. After a so-so \"The Harold Song\", it immediately picks up again with great stuff like \"Crazy Beautiful Life\" and \"C U Next Tuesday\". The final track \"The Sleazy Remix\" is not much of a remix, to be honest. This \"deluxe\" edition also contains 3 music videos (Stephen; Animal; Take It Off). I rate \"Cannibal\" 4.5 stars.\n\n\"Animal\" (16 tracks, including 2 bonus tracks; 54 min.) is not nearly as strong for me compared to \"Cannibal\". Sure, there are several great tracks such as opener \"Your Love Is My Drug\", \"Take It Off\", \"Blah Blah Blah\", and a few others. Knowing how big a hit \"Tik Tok\" had been, I couldn't help but be disappointed when I heard it, as it certainly isn't the strongest song on here. This \"deluxe\" edition comes with two bonus tracks: the excellent \"VIP\" and the okay \"Dirty Picture\". I rate \"Animal\" 3.5 stars.\n\nIn all, quite the collection, and for what I paid for it in Scotland, an absolute steal!","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Oboe lovers rejoice! Four and a half hours of music from the playful and enjoyable instrument that was described in the play Angels in America as sounding like \"that of a duck if the duck were a songbird\" (I pulled that quote from the wiki article on the oboe after going there to see what it said, and I have to admit that I was looking for something to confirm my impression of the oboe as one of the most distinctive instruments in the orchestra).\n\nOf course you should enjoy oboe music if you're going to add this to your collection, but perhaps it could also be an opportunity to explore music with the oboe as a focal point, to see if it isn't so bad after all?\n\nPersonally, I don't need any convincing, I've loved oboe music for a long time, and this was a great opportunity to get some new performances of old favorites, as well as new composers and music unfamiliar to me until now.\n\nAnd that is another reason why I enjoy these Bach Guild releases so much, because of the variety of composers, well known as well as obscure, that are usually included.\n\nI started by sampling this collection from the very first track - the Oboe Concerto in C Major by composer Domenico Cimarosa, and found it to be very enjoyable. From there I jumped to two of Mozart's terrific concertos - the Oboe Concerto in C Major, K.314\/271k, followed by his Oboe Quartet in F Major, K.370\/368b. All of these performances were by the Vienna State Opera Orchestra conducted by Felix Prohaska, with Andre Lardrot as oboe soloist. In fact, looking at the track listing, the majority of the performances in this collection are with Lardrot, who lacks a wikipedia entry but seems to have performed and recorded extensively with Prohaska and the Vienna folks.\n\nThe performances that I have listened to so far are excellent. Many appear to have been taken from the series of 'Virtuoso Oboe' LP's that appeared on the Vanguard label in the 1960's?? (I found 1974 given as the release date for a couple of these when doing some quick internet searching but the Vol 3 LP is identified here on Amazon as from 1963. If I am able to better pin down exact dates of recording and first release I'll update my review to include that information):\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Virtuoso-Oboe\/dp\/B005TOWDS4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Virtuoso Oboe<\/a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Virtuoso-Oboe-Vol-2\/dp\/B00DSWLP3I\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Virtuoso Oboe, Vol. 2<\/a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Virtuoso-Oboe-Vol-3\/dp\/B007QEK490\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Virtuoso Oboe Vol. 3<\/a>\n\nI'm listening to one of the Handel concertos now, but next I'll try some unfamiliar music - perhaps the concerto by Johann Christian Fischer, or the one from Jean-Marie LeClair.\n\nAnd there is one correction to make, so far - the Fischer concerto is mislabeled in this collection. Those three tracks should be:\n\n47. Oboe Concerto No. 2 in E-flat Major - I. Allegro\n48. Oboe Concerto No. 2 in E-flat Major - II. Adagio\n49. Oboe Concerto No. 2 in E-flat Major - III. Rondo: Allegro\n\nThanks to reviewer PacificWoman for catching this in her review here.\n\nOverall, this is great stuff! The Bach Guild has stepped up the pace of their new releases recently, and they're providing us with a wealth of enjoyable music to enjoy as the holidays approach. My thanks to them! Keep it coming!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I've never heard of this label, but somebody sure did a great job of assembling 50 hits in a collection that's cheaper than buying two individual songs. In a category full of cover bands and re-recordings, it's great to hear true original songs, and their clarity is an unusual bonus for an oldies collection.\n\nOn the other hand, it's a darned shame that at least a one unmarked re-recording snuck into this set. Runaway is obviously not the original version. (That's the only one I'm sure about; perhaps other reviewers can find more.) At least half of these songs really are the originals, and the collection would be easily worth the money just for them. I would have given \"45 Real Originals\" a 5-star review, but the sour taste of a re-recording lowers my rating for \"50 (Mostly) Originals\" to 4 stars.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Imagine Black Dog without those opening five seconds, or the whole Led Zeppelin IV album for that matter. Jimmy Page called it \"waking up the army of guitars.\" It also prevents Robert Plant from sneaking up on us - we are ready when his voice bursts out of the speakers. The song is about a lustful old black Labrador Retriever that lived near Headley Grange during the recording sessions.\n\nThe precision of the music is indeed reminiscent of a military close-order drill. The main riff, written by John Paul Jones, represents the guitar army, layers of them, marching together, inspiring awe and respect. They even create a brass timbre somehow, at least to my ears. The call and response pattern lasts until 0:42, when the riff gets twisted up and discombobulated before righting itself at 0:52 as we head into the oh yeah break. Jimmy plays some nifty descending runs and we head into the second verse: I gotta roll can't stand still got a flamin heart can't get my fill.\n\nAt 1:27 we get a calming set of ah ah ah etc from Robert, but then at 1:38 John Bonham's drums explode with awesome power. This is a tremendously exciting moment, one of my favorites of any song. The levels are perfect: attack, loudness, reverb, emotional effect. Whoa. It takes us into another new part, the hey baby whoa baby I-don't-wear-pants-and-I'm-a-lecherous-black-dog part. This goes on until 2:04.\n\nThe song cycles back through the basic layout once more, adding a sweet guitar double helix at 3:07. Finally, at 3:37, the general of the guitar army proudly shows off the skills of improvised battle strategy, as the troops continue their parade with no signs of tiring.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Forms of poetry are often logos of memes with positive flaws while songs have new kinds of sentences, considering my patience with time as though my eyes are actually the students for these ears under my hair.  Yes, and how many ears must one man have before he can hear people cry?  Dylans associations with mankind are fine because he stays loose and plays with syntax to get insight whether he uses plain English or not, so the intrinsic behaviors to his godly motives are fascinating if also miraculous of intellect as well as rarity.  Utter honesty is his best defense when visions are as light as air, contemplating here about the evolution of deaths even if my prosperity can never be considered the obvious return from my oral literacy or one special type of speech impediment.  Dylans accuracy of life portrayal isn't sketchy but quite a definitive reference to wisdom and proclamations which become ironic for possible answers thatd be too long.  The catch phrase Blowin in the Wind for me implies mystery of wisdom since torrents of weather really haunt peaceful armies before spelling out an unknown danger, being itself a collection of memes that form the real word in a society of slippery doves and washed mountains.  My favoritism of folk music is too my actualization of materialism with secondhand spirits during this sleepy discovery of rounds with musical notes, turning my exhausted body into a medium of reception in the causing sunshine near those musical videogame consoles.  Dylans courage is really his fear, very much in tune with his awkwardness of bravery at a moment here and there, performing with twisty physics; I can say more about this, and Dylans determination isn't usually his regret throughout song playing but promises in emotional terms.  His childish strength is his romantic reign of the songs pieces of advice relating to Earths likely devastations, so Dylans imbecility is cute yet truly serves as a warning symbol for doubt exaggeration.  Blowin in the Wind is a romantic chant because Dylan juggles ideas with infatuated meanings rather than observing an obvious thesis, and by getting to basic predictions he turns out to be a very unlikely hero.  Dylan can inscribe lyrics under purple light due to his abstractions with easygoing agony as well as vague demands, and he cuts a statement to the bone, living through reactions toward ordinary nature in his interesting admiration of defense.  Maybe rapid feedback from reviewers gets customers going, but I like to treat our reading as a chance for meditation instead of fashionable conversation attributed to busy people.  In fact, fashionable conversation attributed to busy people is a source of aliteracy.  By my phrase admiration of defense, Im describing what romance is in poetry.  Indeed, with answers blowing in the clouds around the bends of Dylans proclamations over historic references, I believe we need to be more confused about our learned behaviors since our knowledge of love may occasionally be a precipice to the darkness.  Yes, and how many times must a man look up before he can see the sky?  Blowin in the Wind refers to an answer; however, it may refer to a question in addition, so we can try to find statements in the air without having favorites that ruin vivid scenes or training aggravated nerves.  Its pretty neat to be called a friend after Ive realized my personal edification of sensation over mystery, so Dylans casual attraction to his notions is his gusto of his involved presence around quick-playing harmonicas as well as catchy tunes that play out the roles of a guardian over humanity, and its legal.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Most popular singers can attest to that one album that is considered by fans and critics alike as being their apex.  Michael Jackson had \"Thriller,\" Prince had \"Purple Rain,\" and Mary J. had the multi-Grammy-winning \"The Breakthrough.\"  It is unfair to the singers to always compare each successive release with its predecessor for the artists may have different directions and concepts that they wish to pursue.\n\nMary J, though traveling some of the same roads as her previous works, branches out somewhat with \"Growing Pains\" with an album that is possibly more pop-oriented than anything that she has previously done, including \"The Breakthrough.\"\n\n\"Growing Pains\" is a bit of everything that will, no doubt, increase her already large fan base.  Riding high on the strength of the first single \"Just Fine\" and its eye-popping video, the album is a well-crafted blend of R & B, funk, pop, and female angst and strength that can only be done by Miss Mary.\n\nEVERY single song is a winner and each makes a seamless segue to its successor.\n\nBesides that, she looks MIGHTY FINE on every photo in the liner notes!\n\nWe all should grow so well!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":0}

The song is about a woman who craves a man's private parts and is mesmerized by the size of it. DO NOT let your children listen to this! This song is in the movie Katy Perry Part of Me DO NOT let your children watch that movie! The C word is said multiple times since part of this song is in the movie!

For that matter, who is the \"greatest\" of anything? For me, people do wonderful, fascinating things. Sometimes, they leave an impression on you that lasts for a lifetime. When I think about the history of Hip Hop and Rap, I can't do so without thinking of Run D.M.C. For me, these guys cemented rap music as a viable form of expression for urban youths. Yeah, back in the day we all wanted to be like Run, D.M.C., and definitely like Jam Master Jay! Who can forget the tracks \"Sucker MCs\", \"Peter Piper\" or the coolness of \"Rock Box\"? If dope ever spun on wax, it rotated to the sounds of this crew.\n\nNot only was their music very cool, this rap group had their own style of dress. Everything from the shell topped Adidas sneakers to their trademark leather jackets, and Lee jeans. Personally, I never got into dressing like them but I always wondered if the aforementioned companies paid them to promote their line of clothes. Albeit, no one ever accused these guys of being the greatest rappers. Even now as I listen to some of the songs I have to admit quite a few of the lyrics are rather corny.  Corny as they may seem, they always remind me of the days when rap artists were creative and not formulaic. There was a time when the rappers and DJs could be cool, expressive, and not so misogynistic and foul. Yeah, those days existed and it wasn't too long ago.\n\nI think I'll forever love Run D.M.C. For me this is where it all began and it's nice to revisit the old scene every now and then. Here's to the memories.\n\nDJ Come of Age","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"The first time I heard My Chemical Romance, it was on the radio. It was their breakthrough single, \"I'm Not Okay(I Promise)\", and I took the title quite seriously. They were not okay. They were actually quite not good at all.\nHowever, when they released their 2006 album, \"The Black Parade\", a friend played it for me and I was instantly interested. It was a wonderful connection between classic rock allusions and influences mixed with the Misfits. It even had a storyline, though it was nearly impossible to follow passingly (like most concept albums). I was eager to ehar what they did next, and over the course of the next four years \"The Black Parade\" was constantly in my CD player and on my iPod.\nNeedless to say, when I heard lead off single \"Na Na Na\", I was pretty floored. It was a pretty righteous song, all quick guitars and nonsense, but fun, lyrics and possibly the best solo of the last few years. It was, and is, a terrific rock song. I was now eagerly excited to hear what came next.\n\"Danger Days\" does not disappoint any of my expectations, which were already pretty lofty. It is a fun, tight record with a pretty nifty comic book concept and more than a fair share of killer tunes. Like \"The Black Parade\" this is a big, shiny rock record with bigger hooks, with some of the songs, specifically \"Sing\", \"Summertime\" and \"The Kids from Yesterday\", begging to be played live in large arenas. \"Planetary (Go!)\" is downright funky, a truly danceable track with some pretty funny and clever lyrics to boot. \"S\/C\/A\/R\/E\/C\/R\/O\/W\" features the records most mega chorus, and the garage punk tunes \"Party Poison\" and \"Vampire Money\" succesfully call out garage bands of the past while still putting a special My Chem spin on the genre. Occasionally the group falter, most notably on the boring \"Save Yourself\" and \"DESTROYA\", two tracks that failed to leave any discernable impression on me after repeated listens.\nMusically the record is more melodic and keyboard driven than any of the bands previous records, but this style fits the band perfectly. Where their earlier records (which I went back and have a passing interest in as time has gone by) were more aggressive, and \"The Black Parade\" was pretty melodic and epic, \"Danger Days\" mixes the two while adding tighter songcraft. Lyrically the record is strong, and features some of lead singer Gerad Way's best lyrics to date.\nI enjoyed \"Danger Days\" fully. It's a tight, well constructed rock record that's as much fun to listen to as I assume it was to make. If you like MCR, you will almost certainly enjoy this record, and even if you haven't in the past, you might still find yourself nodding your head to quite a few of the songs.","classification":4,"fold":0}

Unfortunately, the subject matter on this album is limited to juvenile love-drama, mainly orchestrated around break-ups, cheating, and circumspect relationships.

It's hard to get past the first song, \"Enough of No Love\" where featured guest Lil' Wayne raps tastelessly with over-the-top curse words. I experienced a difficult time listening to the album once, with no interest in listening to it again. Hopefully, she will present a mature album her next time around.","classification":2,"fold":0}

{"text":"You know you've seen them. You know what I'm talking about. You know the men who look slightly off because there is something just slightly askew about their appearance. You know, the men who should be graying, but they're still trying to look young, and so they dye their hair a dark color and it makes them look odd and pasty? Well, that's \"Songs for the End of the World\" and Rick Springfield at this point.\n\nSomething is just off. Why doesn't Rick look 63? Why does his music sound like it's for kids? Oh sure, he's adapted, unfortunately he's adapted to Blink 182, Fall Out Boy, Panic at the Disco, and all the other bland trendy emo\/punk bands of the last decade. Now sure, Rick rocks and he rolls, but he just doesn't bring the hooks and melodies. He gussies his songs up and tries to knock your socks off, but it just comes off like some kind of weird overcompensation. Like someone who is trying really really hard to sound hip and not old.\n\nAnd this bothers me. You see, Lindsey Buckingham, Tom Waits and Bruce Springsteen were also all born in 1949 just like Rick. If you listen to each of their last albums you will hear (and see) that they have aged gracefully, doing their own thing, not trying to go with the trends, and they all still bring the hooks and melodies and (look their age) and sound respectable. But Rick here, well, you see, he's like that guy I was talking about earlier--the guy who is old but pretends to be young and it doesn't work (or look quite right).\n\nMy first Springfield cassette was 1984's \"Hard to Hold\", and I've stuck with him ever since. But you know, when I went back and listened to all of the albums I own leading up to this new release, the one thing I came away with is that Rick is more of a singles guy rather than an album guy. Every album of his has some really good tracks rounded out with filler. \"Songs for the End of the World\" is no different.\n\nIn fact, the strongest songs are at the front with \"Wide Awake\", \"Our Ship's Sinking\" and \"I Hate Myself\" being the best songs on the entire disc. I suppose \"Gabriel\" is decent, and maybe \"You & Me\". I liked \"One Way Street\", but all I could think about is how the guitar intro comes dangerously close to The Who's \"Pinball Wizard\". And again, although Rick has updated his sound, he has now churned out the same album at least three times--2004's \"Shock\/Denial\/Anger\/Acceptance\" and 2008's \"Venus in Overdrive\" and now \"Songs\". And although I've enjoyed Rick's output since 1999, the honest truth is (and you know it's true if you're being honest with yourself here) that Rick's best work was with RCA. You know 1981 to 1988. That was when he was at his best. From 1999 to 2012, well that's just Rick keeping pace and sounding (and looking) slightly off.\n\nI believe Rick has one great album left in him, but will he dispense with this emo\/punk\/pop sheen that he thinks will keep him younger, and just go for it. Just give us the power pop snyth\/guitar melodies that made his 1980s work so good. He can just update the instruments.\n\nObviously Rick still has some rabid fans because five stars for \"Songs\" is just not possible. It isn't five stars, and it isn't the best album of his career. Like most of his recent work it's just good. Also, the gimmick of using your iPhone application to recognize photos on the insert is kind of cheesy. I did it, and the extra content did not impress me, and there wasn't that much.\n\nI'm going to be the lone voice of reason here and take the heat by saying that it's okay Rick, you can age now, you can give us what we want--your gray hair and pop melodies that actually sound like you and not the band of the moment. It's okay to show some wrinkles and fat, you've earned it. It's okay to make more than one or two hits per album. I give you my permission to make a 12 song or 10 song set that will stand as your Sgt. Peppers.\n\nIt's also okay to not make every song sound almost the same as the next, a problem I found with \"Songs\".\n\nAlso, isn't it about time someone did something about the Springfield catalog? I mean, where's the digitally remastered catalog with bonus tracks or bonus discs? Heck, where's Rick's first five albums from the 1970s? Terribly hard to find in compact disc except for a few. \"Wait for Night\" and \"Beautiful Feelings\" near impossible to find on compact disc. Will we ever get to hear the original \"Beautiful Feelings\" or will it remain just the 1984 re-recordings?\n\nHere's how \"Songs for the End of the World\" compares to Rick's other works:\n\n1972 Beginnings: I haven't heard this.\n1973 Comic Book Heroes: I haven't heard this.\n1974 Mission Magic!: I haven't heard this.\n1976 Wait for Night: I haven't heard this.\n1978\/1984 Beautiful Feelings: I haven't heard this.\n1981 Working Class Dog: Three Stars\n1982 Success Hasn't Spoiled Me Yet: Five Stars\n1983 Living in Oz: Four Stars\n1984 Hard to Hold: Two and a Half Stars\n1985 Tao: Four Stars\n1988 Rock of Life: Three Stars\n1997 Sahara (by Sahara): I haven't heard this.\n1999 Karma: Two Stars\n2004 Shock\/Denial\/Anger\/Acceptance: Two and a Half Stars\n2005 The Day After Yesterday: Two and a Half Stars\n2007 Christmas With You: I haven't heard this.\n2008 Venus in Overdrive: Three Stars\n2009 My Precious Little One: I haven't heard this.\n2012 Songs for the End of the World: Two and a Half Stars","classification":3,"fold":0}

For Ariana, I was not very impressed with her lackluster songs already released from her Dangerous Woman album from Into You and Dangerous Woman. But also her song from last year, Focus didn't even shine her voice brighter, instead her voice sounded more shrill and putting too much emphasis on looking for herself, than a real voice. Her latest single, Let Me Love You, the third from her Dangerous Woman, isn't actually a striking duet. She and Lil' Wayne do not even have enough chemistry to sparkle on this track to shimmer as one of the more classic duets. Perhaps ariana has more growing up she has to do to make the heart firmly fonder. Maybe when she makes another record, it will work for her, but not now.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":0}

{"text":"(A deluxe version of the album with four additional tracks is available on lang's official Web site.)\n\nk.d. lang has earned the rare right to record exactly the material she wants, how she wants, and still expect an audience, and \"Sing It Loud\" reflects that with its self-assured, but often self-indulgent, songcraft - a formula that is ultimately winning due to her charisma and raw talent.\n\nSharp-edged hooks don't run aplenty, so the songs do not generally demand individual attention, but they also sparkle with spotless polish, the result of an obviously meticulous attention to detail that makes the album play highly satisfyingly.\n\nThat lang has recorded the album she wanted shows in the details. \"Sing It Loud\" is the kind of record a musician makes for his or herself, which means it will surely delight her most devoted but divide those who appreciate her on a more selective basis.\n\nThe songs are co-written with Joe Pisapia, who left his seven-year tenure with Guster to join lang in the studio and on the road. Selections such as the off-kilter, idiosyncratic \"Sugar Buzz\" and the peace-loving anthem \"Perfect Word,\" which makes sweeping, grand use of the elastic fireball that is lang's voice, make the source of his motivation to work with her quite clear. Their talents gel well, and with lang's miraculous pipes as Pisapia's muse the results are purposeful and passionate.\n\nWhether the mood is thoughtful and considered (the ruminative \"Heaven,\" \"Sing It Loud,\" \"Habit of Mind\"), playfully romantic (\"Inglewood,\" the soulful opener \"I Confess\") or cheerfully optimistic (\"Sorrow Nevermore\"), the music is consistently comfortable and restrained - ideal for an outdoor concert in late summer.\n\n\"Sing It Loud\" is not the return to country that many fans of lang's salad days would like, but it is also the closest they may get to it, and given the great quality and labor she has gifted it with this not be considered a disappointment. It is a pleasing, rewarding listen from start to finish, navigated  by one of our most valuable voices.","classification":4,"fold":0}

For their follow-up single from their debut album, The Man Who Can't Be Moved still continues that feel-good Pop music rhythm. While it isn't definitive as Breakeven made out to be, it honestly is still much better than almost all of the other artists that had came out with albums that had more sever overexposure this year so far from Usher, all the way to Justin Bieber. I do hope The Script really does continue well with great songs with their next single from their debut, or when they come out with something delightful soon to match.

The song is definitely one of those songs that still does not go out of style, even with Marvin's classic from his Motown era. I definitely still love this song so much.

{"text":"Something's missing here, and it's not limited to Michael Anthony.\n\nIn terms of SONG SELECTION, it's pretty much a Van Halen fan's dream come true (except for \"Tattoo,\" but let's not go there). Eddie sounds like Eddie, which is at least half the reason why you're here, right? But Dave? The years have not been kind to Dave. The set kicks off in high gear with \"Unchained,\" but Dave's like a lot of \"power\" lead singers who get the point of cheating, sort of \"shout-singing\" the lyrics, and a lot of the hoots and howls he uses to punctuate his vocals (long a Diamond Dave trademark) are now forced and off-key. He TALKS much of the way through \"Runnin' With The Devil\" and there is more of the off-key groaner stuff as well.\n\nI'm not going to get into the politics of the band and whether Wolfgang meets or exceeds Michael Anthony's bass playing but he certainly is no match for him on background vocals.\n\nAs you might suspect, there are NO Sammy songs in the set. Hagar had to tackle 3 Roth songs on \"Live: Right Here Right Now,\" but it's not reciprocated in this set.\n\n\"Panama\" is a groaner. Because of Dave. When he hits the line \"Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue\" you WILL wince. Trust me.\n\nMy understanding of the original Roth-era shows was that they could be sloppy. When Sammy joined the band he said, on record, that concerts would no longer be a matter of \"ripping the kids off with a clown show.\" In 2015, who knows what's behind Roth's motivation or in his heart (or if he even has one). Maybe he's doing his best. And with a band that based their reputation on 6 hard rock albums unleashed on a rock-hungry world (remember that the first album hit the airwaves at a tie when disco was in its final death throes), what's on this album simply isn;t good enough. Three stars and trust me, I'm being overly generous out of nostalgia.","classification":3,"fold":0}

Life is not black and white. Nothing is really at its best when it is separated and distilled. Michael Jackson knew that in his career and refused to be defined. We would do ourselves and the world a favor that doing the same.\n\nBlack or White contains a message that minds us that we are all human, all important regardless of what we look like.

{"text":"Fever by The Black Keys is also another song that grew on me after hearing it on the DC101 radio station.  The singing complements the instruments in a brilliant way. However, I wish that I understood the full meaning of this sing. Im guessing (after watching the distinctive youtube video to Fever) that the meaning of Fever is through the context of having intensity for a goal and\/or cause. Im also thinking that Fever by the Black Keys is also describing the up and down travails that certain extreme emotions can bring (such as in the lyrics how fever would be a blessing and then sometimes has them frequently realizing that they are to blame for certain situations in their life). I would love for someone to point out the meaning of this song and\/or their interpretation. Regardless of whether someone responds, Fever by Black Keys is a dazzling indie rock alternative rock song.","classification":5,"fold":0}

I'm glad I bought this as I've tried to track down their Woodstock set over the years and haven't really been able to do so successfully.  Nice release.  Any Santana would love it as the Woodstock set just jumps off the record as a lively live set and this lst lp, along with their 2nd and 3rd albums (Santana ll and lll I guess), as most folks know, they had that magic combo of musicians for those 3 lps and the 3 of them really are the best Santana releases ever.  Scientifically proven.  Well, ok, I'm kiddin', but you can see they just got the groove right and the distribution of sound from among this set of musicians.  The previously officially unreleased non lp tracks never have been that great and still aren't but they flesh out that time period of released tracks from them.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"The best studio albums have something to recommend about them: the artist and the mixers can make the recordings just as perfect as  possible - mixing the various tracks to blend perfectly, and editing and re-recording any mistakes.\n\nStill - live shows always have an appeal that can't be recreated in a studio.  Something about performing live, especially in front of an appreciative audience,  inspires musicians to heights that are difficult to reach in the more sterile recording studio.\n\nThat being said, \"Live\" albums are notorious for not quite capturing the experience of actually being at the concert.  James Taylor (Live), recorded during his Fall Tour of 1992, masterfully dodges limitations that  plague many recordings.\n\nFirst of all - the recordings are incredibly good, with the mix reflecting the notoriously talented and tight band that Mr. Taylor always has at his disposal.  A perfectionist universally respected in the biz, James Taylor is in a class all by himself among singer-songwriters: he can call upon enough talented musicians to flesh out TWO grammy-level bands, and while he gives everyone a place to shine within the structure of a concert, they all know that they are there to make James and his music sound as good as possible.\n\nSecond of all - this live concert, like an actual JT concert - is extremely generous in the amount of music available.  With two 15 song discs most of his best known songs (up to 1992) are splendidly represented.  Among the 30 tracks are one of my favorite renditions of \"Carolina in my Mind\", plus exceptional versions of \"Sweet Baby James\", \"Fire and Rain\", \"You've Got A Friend\", \"How Sweet It is\", \"Up On The Roof\", \"Something In The Way She Moves\" and many others.\n\nHe is also known for superb covers (thus his two recent projects consisting entirely of cover songs). It is an embarrassment of riches that perhaps the quintessential song writer blesses us with that velvety voice on other's songs as well.  In this project he gives an absolutely scintillating version of George Jones' classic \"She Thinks I Still Care\" and one of the best things about this live recording is listening to his introduction of the song - he says George Jones sings the song so well \"it makes you weep, makes your dog weep, and makes your roof leak.  It's pathetic!\"  Then he unleashes a version so good it would make George Jones weep tears of joy.\n\nIf you don't have any James Taylor in your collection - why not?  And if you're only going to have ONE in your collection... this wouldn't be a bad one.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"This is the personification of a Solid Sophomore Effort. Jazmine Sullivan, or shall I say Ms. Sullivan, hit a home run with this album, as she did with her debut album 'Fearless.' Jazmine has a unique voice and she uses it to the full and this is what makes her music so good. I bought her debut album 'Fearless' and it appears that she still is.....'Fearless' because the music sounds even better! It is timeless music that sounds like it's effortless for her to produce.\n\n1. Holding You Down (Goin' In Circles) \"It has that: `You got me under your spell' vibe. This is the first single and it is a song that makes you want to dance like you've never danced before; this song samples from Mary J. Blige's song `Be Happy.'\"\n\n2. 10 Seconds \"The 2nd Single and it is a blazing track that depicts the climax of problems within a relationship. This song also has a beat sample from Mary J. Blige's song: `I'm Goin' Down.'\"\n\n3. Good Enough \"If you don't want me, someone else will! Jazmine sets an ultimatum for her lover in this song: `If I'm not good enough for you, hit the door and I will be good for someone else.'\"\n\n4. Don't Make Me Wait \"Funky, upbeat song that has a Vanity 6 vibe.\"\n\n5. Love You Long Time \"This song makes you bounce when you hear it. It's an upbeat song about the opportunity to love, love for a long time.\"\n\n6. Redemption \"This is the dramatic song on the album, it reminds me of `Call Me Guilty' from the 'Fearless' album.\"\n\n7. Excuse Me \"A ballad about self-expression.\"\n\n8. U Get On My Nerves Duet With Ne-Yo \"A hot duo about a relationship that is beyond over.\"\n\n9. Stuttering \"This is a song about a nervous crush.\"\n\n10. Famous \"The pros and cons of becoming Famous! Sang it Jazmine!\"\n\n11. Luv Back \"This is the Reggae joint on the CD, once you lose love it is hard to get it back.\"\n\nOverall, the album receives an A+. Jazmine get your gown ready for the Grammy's because you and your extremely talented label mates, and might I add: FELLOW GRAMMY NOMINEES, Fantasia and Monica will be in the house along with you anxiously waiting to hear the results. You all deserve to win! Real R&B hit hard in 2010 and the world better stand up and recognize. In my opinion, you're a winner already by just being nominated, that's an honor. Keep making real music Jazmine, keep reaching our hearts, and we will never have a problem to `Love You Back' because you show this love to us by giving us the gift of music.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Great song (definitely the best song to come out since One Republic's \"Apologize\" (and this is from a guy who tends to favor Metal music overall)).  I Need You Now has a great story, awesome vocals and mostly well done instrumentation.  On this song, they sound way more like a mainstream pop band than a country band.  HOWEVER... this could be an issue:  I want to get an MP3 of it... however, I hear it on KISS FM and I swear the version there is less country.  Does anyone know anything on various mixes of this song?  I have searched wiki and various places, I have found some extreme dance remixes, but I just want the version of the song that gets played on pop radio and I have seen nothing definatively discussing various mixes.  Unless I am imagining things, the version I hear on pop radio seems to be mixed more for pop... the bass seems louder, guitars seem more polished than twangy, steel guitar is pushed to the back of the mix (or maybe even out completely), etc.  All in all, there rightfully seems to be less twang in the KISS FM version.  When I listen to MP3s on Amazon, the song here seems more country than it does on the radio.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated... otherwise I am going to suck it up and just grab this version.  My guess is the version on \"Now 33\" is probably what I want, but that one is not available via MP3.","classification":5,"fold":0}

But with her Lioness: Hidden Treasures, people have found some of her brilliance in what she had left behind in her voice. That showed with Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow? The song is actually one of the better covers from the album. It doesn't feel over-orchestrated like her cover of A Song For You showed. But also deep inside, she showed the voice she could've been before she died, if she beat her demons and vices. It is definitely worth a download for die hard fans of the tragic soul singer. Hopefully, this will give Amy that second listen, that she never had before she died.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":0}

Wendell is truly a first-rate, first-class Soul singer who truly knows what Soul singing is all about and who keeps on making heartfelt, emotive and soul-stirring music and (as such) reminds us that there are artists still making REAL R&B music out there. Wendell has truly outdone himself on this CD and every time I play it I just feel good because the music truly DOES touch and nourish the heart and soul. In light of this, one thing that I honestly can not understand is why Wendell B. is not a bigger star as his music certainly is much better than most of the crap that passes for \"Urban\" R&B on most radio stations these days. If you like your R&B\/Soul music smooth, romantic and emotional then waste no time in getting this CD. Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"To start with, Andra Day only sounds like Amy Winehouse on a couple of songs but, on one of them (Only Love), she channels Amy so closely that you will do a double take and stop whatever you're doing.  So of course these comparisons were inevitable.  If you listen to the whole album, it's clear that Ms. Day has her own sound which hearkens back to 60's soul (further fuel for comparisons to Amy and Adele).  The instantly memorable \"Rearview\" even brings to mind the 60s girl group sound.\nAll of this would mean little if the songwriting, singing, playing, and arrangements weren't uniformly terrific.  They are.  \"Rise Up\" is the radio ready anthem bound to get this newcomer some deserved attention.  There's some nice variety here and people are going to differ in their favorites.  For me it's the absolutely haunting \"City Burns\" which still gives me chills after 20 minutes.\nI'll admit that not every song is superb, but all are good and many could be destined to become classics.  This is a stunning debut which, along with Leon Bridges' \"Coming Home\" last year, is evidence that autotuned sound-alike dance pop hasn't snuffed out the real thing.  You sure know it when you hear it.","classification":5,"fold":0}

The melodies are astounding, and Lou Gramm could still belt 'em out at this point--although his voice was clearly a bit lower by this time.  \"Under The Gun\" was the first track I heard--on rock radio.  It is a classic Foreigner rock song.  I sometimes wish the album had more rockers like this, but it is impossible not to fall in love with many of the other songs.  \"Until The End Of Time\" is an unbelievable ballad that should have been a huge it; for some reason it barely dented the charts!  \"All I Need To Know\" is a heart-felt touching and yet somewhat uptempo song about a friendship on the verge of becoming a romance.  \"Running The Risk\" is another anthem that just tugs on the heart strings.  All of the songs on this album have that Foreigner touch--even if it isn't quite the classic \"rocking\" sound of the old stuff.  Still very much a recommended listen for long-time Foreigner fans.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Like many others, I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of Susan Boyle's sophomore release, \"The Gift.\"  While the album was just as beautiful as \"Dream a Dream,\" it didn't move me the way her first album did.\n\nFirst, the plusses: Susan Boyle still has a pure, clear, crystalline voice with impeccable diction.  She is still able to emote in pieces such as her cover of \"Hallelujah.\"  Her duet of \"Do You Hear What I Hear\" with Amber Stassi is one of the highlights of this album.  She also does nice renditions of \"Perfect Day,\" \"O Holy Night\" and the lesser-known \"Make Me a Channel of Your Peace.\"\n\nThe minuses are that most of the arrangements - while beautiful - are a bit on the slow side (such as \"Hallelujah\"), and there are other times when the choir and orchestra almost drown out her pretty voice.\n\nEven so, this album is a perfect addition to your Christmas music collection - one I would highly recommend.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Telemann is fourth on the rung of composers that The Bach Guild showered with love and recordings in the 1950s. However, as befitting his place as the Ringo of the Bach Guild Beatles (Bach, Haydn, Vivaldi and Telemann, yeah yeah yeah!) Telemann didn't get as much attention or credit as he could have received from The Bach Guild.\n\nIn fairness, scholarship for Telemann evolved much more slowly than the dizzying pace that was given to Bach, Haydn and Vivaldi in the 1950s. Telemanns recordings on The Bach Guild are exclusively devoted to his orchestral output. However, looking through a 2014 hourglass, it seems like a slight, and it might be, and it possibly showed a snobbishness to prefer Bach and Handel over Telemann as a composer of choral and vocal works.\n\nSo what we have in the catalog is a collection of orchestral works of Telemann, in both original instrument recordings, as well as orchestral performances. Telemann and Bach are the only composers in the Bach Guild catalog to be recorded using historically informed practice and big-band orchestra. (Bach Guilds Haydn and Vivaldi recordings all use modern instruments.)\n\nUnfortunately, the fact that this is a Little Box and not a Big Box indicates that the devotion to Telemann was not strong. In fact, it looks as if the devotion runs wide but not deep. Works by Telemann are repeated in the catalog, from the 1950s era recordings to the mid 1990s. In that time, oceans could be filled with new scholarship about Telemann that was unknown prior to the Vienna 1950 recordings. But the 1990s Omega-era recordings do not take advantage of that  in fact, the Omega Telemann recordings feature the exact same repertoire that was recording in 1954 (Don Quixotte Suite, for example). So one can surmise that there was a feeling that there was plenty of Telemann to go around for Bach Guilds liking.\n\nBut in its heyday of the 1950s and 1960s, The Bach Guilds nod to Telemann is still important. Nikolaus Harnoncourts historic early instrument recording of Tafelmusik is included here, as are the exceptional recordings of the New York based Esterhazy Orchestra under David Blum. But there are no revelatory moments to a jaded, learned listener, just a sense that Bach Guild did devote itself to recognizing the music of George Philippe Telemann with a series of recordings that reveals him the equivalent of Vivaldi, if not in prolificacy then in skill. These recordings prompt smiles and elicit good feelings, rather than send one to find out more about this composer. But at the time, this is what they were meant to do.\n\n(And by the way, we did leave Purcell out of the pantheon  however, Purcells extraordinary recorded history on The Bach Guild was mainly due to one man (Alfred Deller). However, we will be paying due attention to Purcell with the Big Purcell Box, due in early 2015.)","classification":5,"fold":0}

This album is fun not only because the songs have great, mostly upbeat rhythm but also because he experiments with lots of sounds and genres in the album. You have everything from a lite dubstep, Thunderstruck (feat. Sarah Russell), to a country sound, Back Home (feat. Jake Owen) and everything in between. Besides teaming up with British Trance artist Sarah Russell and country singer Jake Owen, but also the amazing Aloe Blacc, boy band Hanson, and contemporary Christian artist Nicole Britt. So taking us on this musical journey is done with a little help from his friends.\n\nOverall, I commend Adam Young for taking some risks, moving into new areas even while maintaining the Owl City sound.

{"text":"Down IV Part I - The Purple EP is a six track, 33.18 minute release by the American Doom\/Sludge\/Stoner Rock supergroup Down from September 2012. It is the first in a series of EPs that collectively form a complete body of work known as Down IV but which each stand up as individual releases and which are all sequenced to show one particular element of the band's overall sound.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar; Down's line-up features Pantera's Phil Anselmo on vocals, Corrosion Of Conformity's Pepper Keenan on guitar, Eyehategod's Jimmy Bower on the drums (who has also played with Pepper and Phil in C.O.C and Superjoint Ritual respectively), Crowbar's Kirk Windstein on guitar and now Crowbar's Pat Brudders on bass, replacing Pantera's Rex Brown who in turn had previously replaced Crowbar's Todd Strange.\n\nGenerally, if you like any of the individual bands from which the band members previously come then there is a good (though not 100% guaranteed) chance that Down will suit your tastes, and they are definitely a band worth listening to for any fans on the Doomy, Stonery end of the Metal spectrum.\n\nStylistically, The Purple EP concentrates on the heavier, doomier and most Sabbath-influenced aspects of the band's sound, ignoring the softer acoustic moments or bluesier leanings that intermittently appeared throughout their previous three studio albums. This is both the EP's greatest strength and weakness, as it delivers one complete set of matching tracks in a cohesive and uninterrupted whole, but could equally be accused of being samey or lacking variety if you weren't feeling particularly generous. There is nothing as fun as `Stained Glass Cross' or as evocative as `Jail' for example, but that shouldn't really be a problem when everything that is there is great in its own obvious way.\n\nChoosing highlights from a half-hour EP of similarly themed material is difficult although I would say that it was probably a good idea for the band to market the album using both `Witchtripper' and `Misfortune Teller' as they are definitely the most catchy and instant tracks on the EP. This is not to say however that the rest of the release is anything less than what a fan could want from Down in terms of quality. Every member puts in a good performance, the production job is charmingly raw and the whole thing just feels like pure-Down.\n\nOverall; as long as you already like Down, and aren't necessarily looking for a myriad of different styles and approaches then Down IV Part 1 - The Purple EP is everything you could ask for and you should probably check it out.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"New Cupid feat. Nephew Tommy from the SHMS, aka Oatmeal. Look I will call as I see it, if you are into line dances like the Wobble ,Harlem Shuffle, etc,etc,etc, then you know that most of the local dance studios are on auto pilot when it comes to new line dances, so with new dances there comes new music and Cupid gets an assist from Oatmeal on this dance friendly up-tempo release. This not the Cupid Shuffle revisited but still a song that you put on at a party to get people up to dance. Not to sure if there has been any radio exposure or marketing to reach fans but word of mouth appears to be working out fine just look they have their own line dance dedicated to it. 3 stars","classification":3,"fold":0}

The problem is there is not a lot of De La Soul rapping on this project. There will be minutes of just instrumental playing before they come in for a short verse. In all, a long, but respectable comeback for De La Soul. Worth hearing Pain at the very least.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Almost 14 hours of music for $1.99? How can you pass that up? Schubert is one of the most prolific composers of the Romantic period. This collection includes his best-known works, all performed well. I'm sure classical music snobs would turn their noses up at this, but at their own loss. I may never have to spend any more money on Schubert's works, and I'm perfectly happy with these recordings. Schubert's collection here is one of the least popular of this series, but this collection is as good as any of the others. Schubert's as good as a composer as any of the other composers not named Bach, Mozart, or Beethoven. Plus, it's one of the longest collections in duration. At $1.99, that works out to be under $0.14 an hour, which is the average length of an album. That's just ridiculous!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"There is a difference between a songstress and a product. Unfortunately, it has been a decade since Rihanna had made it on the music scene, and she has been more of a product, not a real singer. Sadly, she has not really been someone whom has made the music of our times, as would be the case with acts like Taylor Swift. Sadly, the hype that she really made to get into her album Anti, has been all hype and absolutely no heart whatsoever. The songs that she came out with the past few years like B&&&& Better Have My Money, and Work just shows that she is more tired and less appealing in her own music each time. Her latest single from her Anti album, Needed Me is definitely another sour note in her work that has been more tired and choppy. She really hasn't found better in her voice, and definitely made another song that really sounds more like she is a product, not someone who's music is infinite like she wants it to be. Perhaps many die hard fans will go back to Umbrella, when she really had became popular.\n\nSong: D-","classification":2,"fold":0}

{"text":"This is the third studio album by the 12-piece Tedeschi Trucks Band, formed when the bands of husband and wife Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi merged in 2010 with a mission of performing original songs. It's this commitment to new material that occasionally proves difficult, together with the demands of arranging for a 12-piece band and incorporating all the band's musical interests - soul, blues, jazz, gospel, world music etc. Their first album 'Revelator' was a masterpiece, their second album 'Made up Mind' was good but not quite as good as the first and the live album showed that although they are primarily a wonderful live band they are prone to jam-band excesses.\n\nThe lead track here \"Anyhow\" is a nice moody soul ballad that has a subdued start but slowly builds, with Susan's vocals excellent as usual and Derek adding subtle slide guitar. More nice slide on the mid-tempo funk of both \"Laugh About it\" and \"Don't Know What it Means\", the latter which features a nice catchy Stevie Wonder-esque chorus. So far, the songs are much like what the band has previously done but \"Right on Time\" is a real departure - very jazzy and very dramatic, featuring both Susan and Mike Mattison on vocals, with period-sounding brass and Derek on dobro. The title track is built around a tricky slide\/organ figure, a bit prog-rock, but with Susan's soulful voice always pulling it back to reality. \"Just as Strange\" is another departure - laid-back semi-acoustic country\/gospel, while \"Crying Over You \/ Swamp Raga for Hozapfel, Lefebvre, Flute and Harmonium\" (catchy title!) starts life as a poppy song featuring Mike Mattison on vocals before Derek's guitar solo eventually segues into an exotic Indian-influenced slide, flute and harmonium instrumental interlude - a bit like things the Derek Truck's Band used to do.\n\n\"Hear Me\" is another nice soulful ballad featuring Susan in great vocal form and more soul on the up-tempo \"I Want More\" with its riffing brass and Hammond but which half-way through segues into another dreamy instrumental interlude which I thought didn't connect with the first part of the song and shouldn't really have been there. \"In Every Heart\"is a dramatic ballad with a trade-mark Truck's stinging slide guitar solo, propped up with beautiful brass playing. I thought that all-in-all this was a better album than 'Made up Mind', with more variety but still concentrating on the band's strengths - Susan's remarkable voice, Derek's guitar playing and the versatility of the whole band. There are a couple of moments that for me didn't really work but I admire the band for not playing it safe and for pushing the envelope, also nice to see Mike Mattinson in the spotlight at last. The record was recorded in their home-studio in Florida and sounds great, I would personally like to see more blues in the mix but I guess that comes out in the live sets, together with the covers. Four stars.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"A cute little song about a man who used women left and right and then found the right woman. It moves along with cute and simple pop music as it tells its story but then, all of a sudden, Elvin Bishop unleashes one of the most eloquent interlude guitar solos you ever heard. In 1976, it hit number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100.  The same year it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

However, the music is just too dull for me to care much about the message.","classification":2,"fold":0}

{"text":"Brian Fallon has the gift of writing songs borne of pain and experience and wrapping it all into a three minute hook-laden anthem.  While I was expecting his first solo anthem to be more of just him and an acoustic guitar, we are met instead with a very Gaslight Anthem-like album...which does not disappoint this die-hard Gaslight Anthem fan.  It's a nice mix of Gaslight, Tom Petty, Springsteen, and Bob Dylan, perfectly blending rock, folk, and alt-country.  All too often with solo albums in the past, I have found myself enjoying some of the songs but in the end missing the original band (i.e. Brandon Flowers solo album); however, this album, perhaps because of its similarities in sound as well as Fallon's unmistakable lyrics, does not leave me with that feeling.\n\nSpeaking of lyrics, Brian Fallon gives us once again some of his best words to date.  Fallon is famous for both the overall themes of his lyrics as well as his one-liners that cuts you to ribbons each time he sings them with his gravelly yet melodic voice.  There are also the classic and familiar Fallon words we see pop up in songs (like \"chains\").  Fallon has always written lyrics that have resonated with his listeners with lyrics of love, loss, and youth; since his divorce, though, I feel like he is writing his most personal and haunting lyrics where you have no choice but to take a long drive with him in the passenger seat and feel his pain.\n\nSome of my personal favorite lyrics on this album include: \"Well, they brought hearts and daggers, they wrote songs about you; when they tied you up in the rungs of ladders and you never ended up coming home; you just became something like some smoke that I tried too hard to hold\" (Smoke); \"And they say such foolish things, like 'Love, love, love, love is all you need;' but everything inside is saying 'Danger, baby, love's gonna leave.' So I played your sympathy, have mercy on me; 'cause I've been hurt, I've been stung, by the good name of love, 'til I threw my own heart in the sea...among other foolish things.\" (Among Other Foolish Things); \"And we want love like it was a drug; yeah all we wanted was a little relief. And every heart I held in between, they were painkillers to me, they were painkillers to me. Come get your painkillers from me.\" (Painkillers); \"And there's a hole in you now like the windshield was taken out. And everybody's hurt, and mine ain't the worst; but it's mine and I'm feeling it now...Sometimes I think it's haunted inside this house.\" (Rosemary).\n\nAfter a few listens, several songs stick out to me: A Wonderful Life, Painkillers, Among Other Foolish Things, Smoke, Steve McQueen, Nobody Wins, Long Drives, and Honey Magnolia.  And yeah, that's 8 of the 12 songs.  The only sound that has not resonated with me so far is Mojo Hand...can't figure that one out yet.\n\nAll in all, this is a near flawless album that fans of Gaslight Anthem and Brian Fallon are sure to love and enjoy with repeated listens.","classification":5,"fold":0}

Every song is about the same tempo and seems more country-flavored than pop-inspired. Honestly, if this wasn't a Christian band, they wouldn't get any radio airplay. But the Christian radio stations don't have a lot to choose from and they tend to play mediocre songs (like Matt Maher's \"Amen\").\n\nHere's an example of mediocre lyrics:\nI'm walking away from the trouble\nI'm walking away on the double\nCutting the ties leaving behind the old life.\n\nI long for the day Christian bands would challenge themselves to write meaningful lyrics again. There are some great writers but it's getting hard to find them in the sea of sameness.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Count 'em. During their remarkable run Gladys Knight and the Pips hit the Billboard Hot 100 Pop charts a total of 40 times. Over the years the group would amass an impressive total of seven Top Ten Hits. It all began in 1961 with the #9 hit \"Every Beat Of My Heart\" on Chicago's Vee-Jay label. Later that same year \"Letter Full of Tears\" would make some noise nationally on the tiny Fury label. Several lean years would follow. Then in 1966 Gladys Knight & The Pips would sign with Motown. After a couple of nondescript releases they recorded the original version of the Norman Whitfield-Barrett Strong tune \"I Heard It Through The Grapevine\". The song went all the way to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Just a year later Marvin Gaye would release his version of the song which spent a total of 7 weeks at the top of the charts. Now you certainly can't go wrong with either version of this tune but I always preferred the original by Gladys Knight and the Pips.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Mary J. Blige - Growing Pains (Geffen, 2007)\n\nWhenever you release a big album (be it classic, certified platinum or both), expectations are always gonna be high for your follow-up. How do you exactly follow an album like Mary J. Blige's 2005 hit,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Breakthrough\/dp\/B000BNTM32\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Breakthrough<\/a>? Well, she must not have worried about it, as Growing Pains is another great album.\n\nAlthough her first single, \"Just Fine\", wasn't exactly the smash that \"Be Without You\" was, it showed her on a more fun and upbeat track than usual. But for everyone who says that she sounds best on tracks about drama, \"Hurt Again\" and \"Talk to Me\" are right up your alley. The only problem is that after 16 years of albums, some of these topics can start to sound redundant. That's why that tracks like the NE-YO\/StarGate-produced \"Fade Away\" and \"Come to Me (Peace)\" are a nice change of pace. Even the duet with Usher, \"Shake Down\", while only a fair song, adds a little bit of love into the mix.\n\nYou can still rely on Mary J. Blige to deliver that great R&B in a time where R&B is losing the battle with hip-hop and country music as the leading genres. The only question is how Mary will follow up this album. -EJR","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"I love the music of the '80s... but somehow I was blissfully unaware of this song's existence until I stumbled upon it in a list from Cracked -- \"The Most Terrifyingly Epic Songs of the '80s.\"  I had heard most of the songs on the list, but had somehow overlooked this one entirely.  Cracked has a sketchy record when it comes to recommendations, in my opinion, but given that I loved most of the other songs on this particular list (\"Eye of the Tiger,\" \"Don't Stop Believing,\" \"Holding Out for a Hero,\" \"Love is a Battlefield,\" etc.), I decided I had to give this one a listen.\n\nI'll just say... if you're an unabashed fan of cheesy '80s poodle-hair rock, you will love this song.  :D\n\nThere's nothing subtle whatsoever about this song.  From the triumphant and soaring synthesizer opening to the epic guitar and drum riffs, this song's instrumentation is the epitome of goofy '80s rock.  The lyrics, while simple, are also rather nonsensical, seeming to hint toward a group of astronauts leaving Earth but otherwise defying easy explanation.  And the lead singer's voice is nothing to write home about, though at least he actually tries to carry the tune and doesn't just yell into the microphone.\n\nAnd yet somehow, this all WORKS.  It's a goofy song, yes, but it's the kind of goofy that leaves a huge smile on your face.  It's a song that's completely over-the-top but in the best possible way, and you can't help but want to bang your head and sing along when it comes on.  I haven't listened to anything else by Europe -- and from what I understand this is their only real hit -- but they sure hit a home run with this number.\n\nThis song has found plenty of new fans thanks to \"Arrested Development,\" but even if you've never seen that show, it's almost impossible not to like this song.  It's not the greatest hit of the '80s, but it sure is one of the most fun... and yes, one of the most terrifyingly epic.","classification":5,"fold":0}

That song delivered absolutely well, yet It All Belongs To Me isn't exactly what was all cracked to be in song. I didn't find the song to deliver, and a weaker blow in voice and harmony.

This `confession' may seem rather startling coming from a reviewer who is as likely here to go on and on about Bolsheviks, `Che', Leon Trotsky, high communist theory and the like. Especially, as well given Ms. Dement's seemingly simple quasi- religious themes and commitment to paying homage to her rural background in song. All such discrepancies though go out the window here. Why?\n\nWell, for one, this old radical got a lump in his throat the first time he heard \"Sing The Delta .\" Okay, that happens sometimes-once- but why did he have the same reaction on the fifth and twelfth hearings? Explain that. I can easily enough. If, on the very, very remotest chance, there is a heaven then I know one of the choir members. Enough said. By the way give a listen to Out Of The Fire and Mornin' Glory. Then you too will be in love with Ms. Iris Dement. Iris, here is my proposal, once again. If you get tired of fishing the U.P., or wherever, with Mr. Greg Brown, get bored with his endless twaddle about old Iowa farms or going on and on about Granma's fruit cellar just whistle.

{"text":"\"This is the start of something good, don't you agree?\" croons 26-year-old Gavin Degraw at the start of \"Follow Through\", the opening track of his debut album, CHARIOT, which has thus far peaked at #8 on Billboard's Heatseeker chart.  While a modest success saleswise as of yet, a thorough listen to the album proves the undeniable fact that this artist and album are destined for bigger, better places.\nDegraw has been at this for quite some time, despite having recently released his debut album.  A native of Manhattan, he has been an integral part of New York's music scene for a while now.  His music being unique yet comfortably familiar, hometown fans have come in droves to see his local shows.\nHis individuality shines throughout CHARIOT.  While at first glance one might think they could lump him with other successful male singer\/songwriters of lately who shouldn't even be being generalized in the first place such as Jason Mraz, John Mayer, Jack Johnson and, most recently, Josh Kelley, Degraw separates himself immediately from them with his smorgasbord of veering song structures, uniquely quirky lyrics and signature voice.  It also helps that his album isn't produced by John Alagia and that his name does not begin with J.\nIn the oddball \"Chemical Party\" he gives you a bird's eye view of what it is to be \"too high to see the point\", while the lead single \"Follow Through\" is a catchy tale of mutual sincerity in what could be the start of a rewarding relationship. \"I Don't Have to Be\", the set's easy highlight, is an ode to individuality.\n\"All I have to do\/Is think of me and I have peace in mind\/I'm tired of lookin' round rooms\/Wondering what I've got to do\/Or who I'm supposed to be\/I don't want to be anything other than me.\"\nOne song with particular hit potential is the endearing \"(Nice To Meet You) Anyway\", which could be considered an optimistic follow-up to the situation presented earlier in \"Follow Through\", which did not work out in the scheme of things, resulting in his finding a more nurturing, special relationship.  Also, in \"Over-Rated\", the uplifting finish to CHARIOT, Gavin tells his companion that, because of her, he now sees the stuff of life to be materialistic and, as it turns out, not so important.\nOther definite highlights include \"Belief\", a stream-of-conscious tune that features Degraw's soaring vocals at its conclusion, and the album's title track, which is delightful to the ears and cannot help but bring a smile or even perhaps a chuckle to the listener.\n\"Your favorite fruit is chocolate-covered cherries\/And seedless watermelon\/Nothing from the ground is good enough\/Body Rise\/Look what's over me\/Oh chariot\/Your golden waves\/Are walking down\/Upon this face\/Oh chariot\/I'm singing out loud\".\nHopefully Gavin will break into mainstream success similar to Jason Mraz, who did so quite a while after his debut album was released.  With an excellent album, a strong local fan base and constant self-promotion, all the right things seem in place for fate to its course. One thing is for sure: This is definitely the start of something good.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 3 is the third of three chamber music Big Box MP3 albums from The Bach Guild. It contains chamber music works from various composers of the classical and early romantic periods of classical music, including (among others): Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Giacchino Rossini, and Luigi Boccherini.\n\nI am much more familiar with most of these composers chamber works than I am with those featured on Big Chamber Music Box Volumes 1 and 2  (both of which I have reviewed here at Amazon.com).  My expectations for the music on this third volume were therefore very high, and I am pleased to report that the music in no way disappointed. Indeed, I am very favorably impressed with both the selections that appear on this album, and the quality of the performances. My favorites include Haydns Quartet for Guitar and Strings in D major; Beethovens Duo for Clarinet and Bassoon in C major; and, of course, Mozarts incomparable Serenade for Winds in B flat major Gran Partita.  I also find Boccherinis Quintet for Guitar and Strings in E major to be especially enjoyable.\n\nAs is the case with every Big Box MP3 album I have purchased thus far, the audio quality of Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 3 is excellent. This is a clear winner that I think is hands-down the best of the three Big Chamber Music Box volumes from The Bach Guild. At only 99 cents, its also an unbeatable bargain that deserves a place in every classical music collectors digital library. Most highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Finally. Passed from label to label, a classic album called Kamaal the Abstract held in the mix, A Tribe Called Quest frontman Q-Tip has at long last released his first record in music's Brave New World, titled The Renaissance. Less blatant (read: less poppy) than his solo debut, 1999's stellar-enough Amplified, Tip's latest is - more than anything he's yet released - the work of a seasoned auteur. Save for a few drops of production goodness from the late J. Dilla and a handful of hooks offered by the finest of today's high-profile soul singers, The Renaissance is 100 percent Q-Tip. He wrote it. He produced it. He recorded it. He played a number of the live instruments. He mixed it. He even offered up the not-always-great scratches sprinkled throughout. These are all good things; all you really need on a Q-Tip solo album is Q-Tip - few in the history of the genre can equal the man's understanding and all-around aptitude. Also, unlike the majority of today's charting artists, Q-Tip can handle the weight of a full-length without stocking his productions full of guests, interludes and other distractions that work against the high level of cohesion his records are long known for.\n\nSimilar to his Tribe, who offered a more authentic hip-hop sound than the peers of their time, Q-Tip presents soulful, jazzy hip-hop in the face of the trends the genre is currently drowning in - namely cheap production, unfocused work and empty lyrics. That said, the composition of the album isn't as fluid or jazzy as the Tribe records - hardly a detriment to this very solid album. Production handled not on a souped-up computer but on the classic beat-based tool of the 90s, an MPC, The Renaissance comes off as a collection of organic loops, subtle live musicianship and dusty drums, just as many of the greatest hip-hop albums have since the beginning of the genre. Lots of piano, lots of sturdy bass lines and breaks; imagine what the often-too-clean Soulquarians' productions would've sounded like in, say, 1991 and you'll have an idea of the sound here. None of Tip's arrangements here are too complex or deep, rather, the production focuses on clarity and soul, resulting in a sound that will likely remain just as timeless sounding as The Low End Theory and Midnight Marauders - a longtime focus, clearly, for the artist.\n\nIt must be said: damn if that classic voice and delivery doesn't manage to sound just as good as it did 15 years ago. That it's still so strong and consistent is a surprise, given the break in output. Lyrically Tip often plays the role of Elder Statesman, though never in a preachy or pompous manner. His writing still doesn't demand any level of academic study or interpreting; everything here comes off as mostly obvious, but in a way that has always worked for the artist. While most of the big-name hooks (most notably the ones sung by D'Angelo and Norah Jones) work well enough, as a whole the blatant R&B element (most notably Raphael Saadiq's lackluster contribution) feels a bit forced and gawky. Q-Tip himself can sing just fine and, more than maybe any rapper ever, Q-Tip himself can supply a memorable hook - as proven on the tracks not featuring other artists. As proven on countless Tribe tracks.\n\nOpener \"Johnny is Dead\" kicks things off in an upbeat, fleshed-out manner before \"Won't Trade\" kicks in. Over a simple start\/stop beat Q-Tip shows off his influential lyrical lucidity, offering some of his best verses since 1996's Beats, Rhymes and Life. \"Getting' Up,\" a radio hit in-the-waiting, follows, offering a display of the artist's fully developed understanding of his genre - coming off almost as a perfect model for boom-bap song craft. Really, every song here is worth getting to know. The stellar J. Dilla produced \"Move\" ends quickly before segueing into a mid-album hidden track (huh?) that functions as the album's title - and maybe best - offering. Okay, I'll say it: this song - as well as \"Shaka,\" the slow-building \"Dance on Glass\" and \"Official\" - sounds like classic A Tribe Called Quest. It's true, and it's an amazing thing to hear after all these years away from that sound.\n\nThe Renaissance may not be the best hip-hop album of 2008 but it's certainly the most needed. Hell, it's probably the best, too. All the young whippersnappers out there still have much to learn from this man and his art. Now if Tip could just get the critically acclaimed (though never released) Kamaal the Abstract, his intended label-shelved follow-up to Amplified, out for the jazzy hip-hop world to learn and love.

{"text":"I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play \"Amarillo By Morning,\" and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to \"Amarillo by Morning.\"\n\nSo, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy\/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"John Powell is without a doubt one of the most unique voices in film composition. His style is nothing but his own. I have never heard another composer come close to his sound and what he's able to do with it. John Powell also has the honor of being the best modern day composer of animated films.\n\nHow To Train Your Dragon is Powell's first animated score since Ice Age 3, which I will admit was a disappointment even though I loved his score to Ice Age 2. How To Train Your Dragon is a much more inspired film, and John Powell brought every ounce of effort he had to the table.\n\nThe score itself is just beautiful if you had to describe it in one word. There are two themes that Powell uses variations of. The themes themselves are 100% pure Powell. Fans of his may hear a bit of Kung Fu Panda in it with a touch of Ice Age. However, the score as an exercise in storytelling is just brilliant and one of a kind when examined that way. It will gently carry you and lift you up to a level you could never imagine. Beauty emerges from its simplicity and the emotions that grow will remind you for just a moment how unique it is to be a human being and feel these emotions. Tracks like \"Forbidden Friendship\" and \"Where's Hiccup\" will move you in a delicate fashion. Examining moments of fear with curiosity and a growing companionship, or moments of loss and hope and the ability to come back when all seems lost.\n\nTracks like \"Test Drive\", \"Romantic Flight\" and \"Coming Back Around\" soar high on human spirit and are just pure celebrations of joy and love and will likely bring you to tears. Powell does incorporate a Scottish sound for one of the themes to add flavor and atmosphere to the setting, but it never outweighs the true identity of the score. The song \"Sticks & Stones\" is included near the end of the album and is performed by J&oacute;nsi who is part of the Icelandic group Sigur R&oacute;s. It's a perfect closing to an amazing album.\n\nFull of Powell's trademark percussion and signature descending note progression this score is an absolute wonder. It reinforces just how powerful an inspired score can be and what it can do for the film. It's a beautiful celebration of the human spirit and the bond of friendship. This is a score you won't want to pass over. I always felt that Happy Feet was Powell's best score up to this point, but I do believe he has topped himself.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"The downward spiral away from music with any semblance of song structure continues. The God of Anger Pop, who once created the singularly perfect musical moment that was Pretty Hate Machine, must have reached his seventh day of creation: for he is clearly resting on Ghosts. This is Reznor on a lazy day, bored with nothing better to do.\n\nGhosts I-IV is an organized chaos of happy (and angry and sad) accidents. I imagine a herd (or pod?) of Macs and samplers, pots and pans; left to their own devices, could produce something akin to Ghosts if they tried real hard. And I suspect Trent made exactly what he intended to make.\n\nI admit that I'm still a pathetic hold-out waiting for Pretty Hate Machine II - The Revenge. Thus, nothing less will ever truly satisfy. Ghosts is neither fixed nor broken. It's really not that bad, but it's just not that good. And for a small fistful of dollars, I shouldn't complain.\n\nI certainly like the progressive and revolutionary distribution (a la Radiohead's Rainbows) where the evil middle-man record company is kept out of the artist's and fans' relationship. I have to give kudos to NIN for fighting the good fight. So at worst, Ghosts I-IV will take up some precious space on your iPod. At best, it's harmless background noise. NIN Ghosts is a little haunting but definitely not scary.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"I like \"lullaby and...The Ceaseless Roar\" better than Plant's last two efforts, 2010's \"Band Of Joy\" and 2007's collaboration with Alison Krauss, \"Raising Sand\". To me, \"lullaby\" feels complete from beginning to end with no filler. It feels personal, rather than those two albums which were filled with covers. So, in essence, this is the first original plant album since 2005's \"Mighty Rearranger\". Plant retains Justin Adams, John Baggott, Billy Fuller and Liam \"Skin\" Tyson from that album (and pretty much from 2002's \"Dreamland\" album) and adds Dave Smith and Juldeh Camara to round out his back up band, The Sensational Space Shifters.\n\nPlant and co. do everything right here from only having 10 tracks (sans the chanting instrumental \"Arbaden\" that ends the album, which I could easily just hit the skip button or program out). What you have left is 10 solid tracks with Middle-Eastern flourishes, folk, rock, blues all melded in that inimitable Plant fashion. This is his best work in a decade, and might be one of his career bests. At 66, Plant still knows how to excite.\n\nMy two choices for 'hits' would be \"Rainbow\" and \"Somebody There\". Each song on the album has it's own identity, which makes for a great listen front to back, something few artists can do, period, let alone in today's music marketplace. \"Little Maggie\", \"Pocketful Of Golden\", \"Embrace Another Fall\", \"Turn It Up\", \"A Stolen Kiss\", \"Poor Howard\", \"House Of Love\" and \"Up On The Hollow Hill (Understanding Arthur)\" are all showcases for Plant and his band at the top of their game. I don't know how they could surpass \"lullaby\" at this point. \"Mighty Rearranger\" was just a pre-cursor to \"lullaby\". A warm up.\n\nAll this being said, isn't time that Plant's solo work be considered as equal to the work he did with Zeppelin? Sure, some of Plant's solo works don't merit comparison, but some do, especially \"lullaby\". I also think 1988's \"Now And Zen\" was excellent from beginning to end. I'd even argue for 1993's \"Fate Of Nations\" as well.\n\nAnyway, Plant is one musician I don't have to complain about not changing his sound, not experimenting enough, not collaborating with fresh talent, not trying to reach for something more in his music, because he does all of that and more. He is the poster boy for all others 60+, and some younger too! I always look forward to a new Plant album because he doesn't really disappoint.\n\nHere is how \"lullaby and.....The Ceaseless Roar\" compares with Plant's earlier solo works and Zeppelin's works:\n\n1969 Led Zeppelin: Three and a Half Stars\n1969 Led Zeppelin II: Five Stars\n1970 Led Zeppelin III: Four Stars\n1971 Led Zeppelin IV: Five Stars\n1973 Houses Of The Holy: Five Stars\n1975 Physical Graffiti: Five Stars\n1976 Presence: Four Stars\n1979 In Through The Out Door: Four Stars\n\n1982 Pictures At Eleven: Four Stars\n1983 Principle Of Moments: Three and a Half Stars\n1984 The Honeydrippers: Three and a Half Stars\n1985 Shaken 'N Stirred: Four Stars\n1988 Now And Zen: Five Stars\n1990 Manic Nirvana: Four Stars\n1993 Fate Of Nations: Five Stars\n1998 Walking Into Clarksdale: Three Stars\n2002 Dreamland: Three and a Half Stars\n2005 Mighty Rearranger: Four Stars\n2007 Raising Sand: Three and a Half Stars\n2010 Band Of Joy: Three and a Half Stars\n2014 lullaby and...The Ceaseless Roar: Five Stars","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Joanna Newsom is one of the great indie musicians of our time -- just look at last year's \"Ys,\" a sprawling masterpiece of freakfolk.\n\nAnd after the solemnities of \"Ys,\" apparently Newsom has decided to go a bit more lighthearted. \"Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band\" is an unpretentious little EP, with some new songs and new takes on older songs -- a fun little treat.\n\nIt opens with the strong folky chords of \"Colleen,\" a slice of Celtic-flavoured balladry that trickles through an oddball melody. \"I tell it as I best know how,\" croons Newsom in her crazy-fairy voice. \"Pick me up and toss me round\/I lost my shoes and tore my best gown...\"\n\nShe then follows it up with new versions of two older songs: the gentle haunting reimagining of \"Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie,\" and a full-band version of \"Cosmia,\" which seems nicely fleshed-out and polished.\n\nAfter to the legendary grandeur of \"Ys,\" this little EP seems relaxed and laid-back, as if Newsom and her band had sauntered into a coffee shop and done an impromptu set. They're done with an ear for fun, but that doesn't take the delicate, appealing edge from the music.\n\nHer twangly, delicate harp is matched up with some decent banjo tunes, and what sounds like some soft drums, all mingled together. In \"Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie,\" we mostly just get gentle strums from the harp. And over it all is Newsom's creaky, meandering vocals, wandering through the melody like a sleepy fairy.\n\nOne new song and two reworkings, but \"Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band\" is stil worth getting for anyone who likes eerie, weird little folk songs.","classification":5,"fold":0}

Somberly, she had been through a lot in her personal life from Jay-Z cheating on her, and having a child out of wedlock. Also, her own music has failed to ignite with her controversial performance at the Super Bowl, which overshadowed Coldplay's delightful recognition at the halftime show of the Super Bowl. Sadly, Beyonce' Knowles has also lagged at the soul. Beyonce's song Formation, the lead song from her so-called # lemonade doesn't ignite, and in fact sounds wimpy from the soul. She doesn't ignite in song at all, and somberly Beyonce' Knowles misses the soul in her work. She really wanted to make a controversial song which worked, and instead it falls flat on deaf ears for new and die hard fans.

And the instrumentation is at times gorgeous, with excellent fiddle and mandolin work; in fact, that's when the band really shines.  Steven Harris' production defintiely leaves some Dave-Matthewisan footprints, and that's fine with me, too.  So what's the problem?

I really didn't find the song to have the intimacy that he brought out with When I Was Your Man, or the vibrant ignition he had showed on Locked Out Of Heaven.

With lyrics like, \"I'm tired I'm worn My heart is heavy From the work it takes to keep on breathing\", this song just had me hooked.  And the chorus, \"Let me see redemption win Let me know the struggle ends That You can mend a heart that's frail and torn I wanna know a song can rise From the ashes of my broken life That all that's dead inside can be reborn I'm worn\".  What else can you say.  This song is so well written.  If you've ever struggled in life, this is the song for you.  God will show up just when we're at our lowest\/darkest point, God will restore all that has been  lost.  Praise God.  I love, love, love this song.  I would recommend this song to everyone.

Is it a tad over-dramatic?  Maybe--after all, it's a Broadway tune.  But, for those of us who got downright nauseous listening to \"Candy Man\" four million times, \"I've Gotta Be Me\" is a revelation, a vocal so big and full of life that it just can't be overlooked.

{"text":"I.G.Y. was the lead track of Donald Fagen's solo album, the Nightfly, and the hit single from that album. Stylistically it's essentially a Steely Dan song, as Fagen was half of Steely Dan. The International Geophysical Year of the title was a real event, a scientific program declared to share scientific knowledge, especially between East and West, that produced the first sattelites  (Sputnik and Vanguard), the Antarctic Treaty and NASA among other things.\n\nDonald Fagen's song is set in that period with the singer extolling the beautiful world that is coming due to the scientific progress of mankind - \" From this point of time it's clear, this dream's in sight \", and goes on to predict everything from solar powered cities to undersea rail tunnels. There are even spandex jackets for everyone.\n\nFagen was alive in the I.G.Y. and like any of us who were young then would have totally believed the idealistic optimism expressed by the lyrics. The song captures perfectly a certain Camelot-like moment of time when all this seemed actually possible. It's hard to convey to anyone today the feeling of prosperous late Fifties America that everything was going incredibly well and that we were only a few more scientific discoveries from perfection. The song does that; it captures the thoughts and the feelings of that time perfectly.\n\nBut the song is from 1982 and that throws a whole new light on its lyrics. Hey, it's 1982 and where is all this stuff? Not only have none of these inventions happened but the whole dream has been shattered and we've only arrived in an era of pessimism and doubt. Fagen's usual Steely Dan cynicism and satirical bent takes over and the jaunty tune and pie in the sky lyrics become their own undoing. The song both captures the moment then destroys it.\n\nA brilliant song.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Electric Wizard like it retro.  A lot.  For a band that has gotten top billing as the world's heaviest band, they are content to settle for a muddy analog sound that nearly swallows the drums, and all but buries vocalist\/guitarist Jus Oborn's singing, rendering them almost indecipherable, although you can read the lyric sheet if you want.  That's the bad news, and costs them one star.\n  As far as the rest goes, \"Time To Die\" is prime EW fare, slow, druggy, Satanic and steeped in Sabbath-y goodness or badness, depending on your religious affiliation.\n  The guitars are up front, the bass pretty much locked in with them, and the album is definitely heavier and more sinister than \"Black Masses\".  In fact, it's sonically the heaviest (what other term can one use for this kind of gloom and doom) since \"Dopethrone\", their highpoint and still one of the great doom metal records ever.  It's also a bit angrier, which could be traced to the lineup change frustrations and the feud with their former record label, run by Lee Dorrian of Cathedral fame.  I'm not taking sides here, but the record does have an edge other EW CD's don't.\n  Of course, there's the nude girl at a Satanic ritual photo inside the sleeve, voice overs addressing Satan worship and other gimmickry Wizard have used to some success.  That may not be a good thing, but as always, someone who would use music as a catalyst for bad behavior is looking for some excuse to act that way in the first place.  For old geezers like moi, who have long lived past the gimmicks employed over decades, it comes down to music, and I ignore lyrics most of the time anyway.  \"Time To Die\" is not the top doom album of the year - that will go either to Yob or Pallbearer's new albums - but it's a worthy inclusion for lovers of the genre nonetheless.","classification":4,"fold":0}

Or if nu-metal's your thing(Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit), look elsewhere. The problem is that their sound doesn't stand out in the rock world; Creed, Puddle Of Mudd, Godsmack , Staind and others are pretty much doing the exact same thing. But the bands I just mentioned do put out solid material, and so does Nickleback. Silver Side Up is better than this,but not by much. Before the album came out, the band said that this album would be a hybrid of Metallica and Pantera,which would essentally make it one of the heaviest albums ever.

{"text":"Greatest hits collections are akin to looking at coffee table art books: while they give you a sense of the painting, the pictures are just reproductions and can never capture the true impact of the original work,  nor  the textures, scope and feel of the painting.\nThat said, the Blue  album does make a decent attempt to capture the Beatles during one of their  most productive, influential periods. The sound isn't noticably better than  the previously issued cds, but on some of the Sgt. Pepper tracks this cd  allows for better isolation of the individual tracks without the  \"links\" or transitions intruding making it perfect for random  play on your cd player.\nThe cd booklet is better than most of the other  Beatles reissues as they feature photos not found with the original 1973  issue of the album. The lyrics are also provided duplicating the original  inner sleeves for the lp's.\nMost of the albums and singles are pretty  well represented, although both THE WHITE ALBUM and ABBEY ROAD are short  changed compared to Pepper and MMT. Like the Red album, this cd could have  been better programmed; the additional running time of the cd isn't used to  any great advantage.\nThe addition of some essential album tracks would  have been welcome(particularly Lennon's loopy \"Hey Bulldog\" which  is still consigned to the oblivion of the YELLOW SUBMARINE soundtrack--the  Beatles album least likely to be owned by fans). Also, most of the medley  for ABBEY ROAD could easily have been included. To make this collection  complete(now that the anthology series has been issued)the next reissue  should include the flawed Beatles classics \"Free as a bird\" and  \"Real love\".\nThe collection features  some of the best  collaborative and solo compositons by John and Paul. George is also very  well represented with some of his best compositions(including the tounge in  cheek b side \"Old brown shoe\")\nAltogether, a good album but,  like that coffee table art book, it'll never truly capture the essence of  the band's art.

For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, \"Numb\":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.  Tac has stated:  \"...it's a snapshot of our generation right now.  The way a lot of us feel in a time of war, technology, pain and love.  It's easy to feel dissociated and NUMB to all the chaos we call life today.\"  I have felt this way, but I haven't articulated it, even to myself.  ABiCA's lyrics reflect this state of affairs, and musically they draw on various influences. The main ones I notice are Linkin Park, Hollywood Undead and of course, Eminem.\n\nThe lyrics cover the whole range of problems - political, personal and social. The title track presents the hopelessness which pervades the album: \"If everything that mattered to me is now gone...Now take a closer look and tell me what you see.\"  Track 2, \"Tell Us Why\", continues with the directly political: \"We are underground...Before you say goodbye, you've got to tell us why.\"  Things get more personal in \"Turn Me On\", which seems to be about people questioning one's route to self-satisfaction.  In \"My Song\" and \"The Things You Think I Say\", the anguish is over failed relationships.  \"The Pursuit\" has the lines \"Just let me in...If I get the chance to play, I think you'll want me to stay.\"  \"Beautiful\" has a lyric that has certainly entered my head many times:  \"You're beautiful, so {CENSORED} beautiful...I'd be a little more complete if I just had you.\"  \"Just Another\", \"Never That Far Away\" and \"Nothing Here\" are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense, demanding and hypocritical.\n\nAs for musical influences, there are elements other than the ones I mentioned above which are noticeable. Three of the tracks open with melodic, solemn piano, which tells you that you should expect something dark and serious.  \"I Can Be Real\" and some other tracks have an industrial sound reminiscent of, say, Nine-Inch Nails.  \"Gave 'Em A Reason\" opens with dance music elements, then includes some excellent guitar work, both grungy and psychedelic - a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic, spiritual, up, and grunge is depressing, scary, down.  Several tracks have a synth-string background that gives them a more mainstream sound.  \"Just Another\" includes military-style drumming and Army-march lingo.\n\nRelease from numbness comes in the final track \"What You See\", with an ironic twist.  They sing, \"Open up your eyes...Nothing more to hide...now the time has come\/And all this goes away, and I'm not {CENSORED} NUMB...Look around, NOTHING EVER HEALS THE PAIN.\" The irony lies in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them.  It could almost be an 80's pop-rock track, and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting.  Hmmmm...\n\nThe album is full of explicit language (which I had to censor in this review), so if you are one of those people who can't take that, by all means stay away.  But if you are OK with free expression, you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that has been around for a while.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Fronted by the otherworldly voice of Ben Bridwell, Band Of Horses make dreamy folk music ala Fleet Foxes and My Morning Jacket. Alternating between cushiony pop, unabashed folk and guitar rock, \"Cease To Begin\" cuts a wide swath musically. Sometimes the jumps can be jarring, like when the bashing guitars of \"Cigarettes Wedding Bands\" slips into the country ballad \"Window Blues,\" complete with a banjo. There's a great opener in \"Is There A Ghost\" that mixes both the dream-pop with an eventual cascade of guitsr, combing the band's strength in the best offering here. What ties this all together is Bridwell's voice and an uncanny sense of melody; even his brashest songs have underlying hooks. Add some really gorgeous harmonies (\"Window Blues\" again), you get one of those indie bands earning their cred the hard way, by working outside the system. \"Cease To Begin\" is a relaxed and understated album.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"The way I see it, Trivium's new album \"The Crusade\" is an awesome follow up to their 2005 effort \"Ascendancy\" which was a darn good album, but this album in my eyes is a whole lot better and it's their best album thus far, and it's also one of my all time favorite metal albums of 2006 (Slayer's \"Christ Illusion\" holds the title for my favorite and best metal album of 2006 though). I remember hearing the song \"Ignition\" on my Music Choice Metal station (channel 310) prior to the album's release, and after hearing it, I knew I had to get the album, and I don't even regret buying it whatsover. Yeah I know this album has recieved some mixed reviews on here, due to the change of direction the band went with this album, I acutally believe they changed for the better on this album. My point is if some people don't like this album, that's just fine with me. I'm a good sport about it, and I respect other people's opinions as long as nobody disses each other's opinions. While Trivium's past realeaes were mostly metalcore, \"The Crusade in my mind borderlines thrash metal. On \"The Crusade\", vocalist\/guitarist Matt Heafy has abandoned his harsh metalcore esque screams (which I'm glad he did) in favor of low agressive clean singing vocals which bring Metallica's James Hetfield (\"And Justice For All\" era) to my mind. I actually find his singing vocals very good on here. This album also is just loaded with great guitar riffs and awesome blazing solos from Matt and second guitarist Corey Beaulieu whom are both awesome on the axes. You also have great hearable bass lines from Paolo Gregoletto, and great drumming from Travis Smith. The album opener \"Ignition\" is a great fast, addicting, track and it's my favorite song on the album bar none. This song also brings vintage Megadeth and Metallica to my mind especially in the chorus, and the solo by Matt is awesome as well. Lyrically this song reflects society as it is today. \"Detonation\" is another great thrasher with five solos (three from Corey and two from Matt). Another one of my favorites on here. \"Anthem (We Are the Fire)\" brings Iron Maiden (another one of my favorite bands) to mind especially the guitarwork for instance. You just gotta love the line in that song: \"The Music Connects, Unites Us More\". We also have a great catchy ballad \"This World Can't Tear Us Apart\" which is another one of my favorites. Some other songs on here are also about famous killings. For example: Track three \"Entrance of the Conflagration\" is about Andrea Yates's murder of her five children in which she drowned all of them one by one in a bathtub, because she believed that they were all possessed. Track five \"Unrepentant\" is about Nazir Ahmad's murder of his three daughters and one stepdaughter (I believe it was Ahmad's stepdaughter who committed adultery), track six \"And Sadness Will Sear\" is based upon the murder of Matthew Shepard, and track eleven \"Contempt Breeds Cotamination\" is about the death of Amadou Diallo who took 19 bullets out of 41 gunshots. The 8+ minute closing instrumental \"The Crusade\" is in my eyes the crowning jewel of the entire album. Five awesome solos are included on the track including a killer bass solo from Paolo. While not as great as Metallica's \"The Call of Ktulu\" off 1984's \"Ride The Lightning\", but it's great nonetheless. Please read on for the songs and the ratings.\n\nJeremy's song ratings:\n\n1. Ignition (3:54) - 5\/5 (My favorite song and very addicting too)\n\n2. Detonation (4:28) - 5\/5\n\n3. Entrance of the Conflagration (4:35) - 5\/5\n\n4. Anthem (We Are the Fire) (4:03) - 5\/5\n\n5. Unrepentant (4:51) 5\/5\n\n6. And Sadness Will Sear (3:34) - 5\/5\n\n7. Becoming the Dragon (4:43) - 5\/5\n\n8. To the Rats (3:42) - 5\/5\n\n9. This World Can't Tear Us Apart (3:30) - 5\/5\n\n10. Tread the Floods (3:33) - 5\/5\n\n11. Contempt Breeds Contamination (4:28) - 5\/5\n\n12. The Rising (3:45) - 5\/5\n\n13. The Crusade (8:19) - 5\/5 (Great instrumental)\n\nBottom Line: Some people will like this album, some people won't like it, and if they don't, that's fine with me, I've got no control over other people's decisions. Like I said before this album is Trivium's best thus far and also one of the best metal albums of 2006 although Slayer's \"Christ Illusion\" holds the title for best metal album of 2006 in my mind. So if you're a fan of Trivium, heavy metal, thrash metal, or just good music in general, by all means you must own this album. Enjoy!!","classification":5,"fold":0}

I grew out of it, came to discover a full array of music from little known artists or bands from the far reaches of this world. My taste was a bit more refined from the days of me buying my first CD. Or so I thought! When \"Toxic\" came out, it honestly annoyed me but the more I heard it, the better it sounded. I realized this was a departure from the simplistic arrangements I'd come to expect from Britney, it was actually full of layers of sound and lyrics that had something to them. I know somebody reading this will say, \"huh?\" when I'm talking like this but I actually think there's some substance to this song, even a challenge to Britney's usual music. It's cool if you totally disagree but I think that it's a great pop song, whatever that means to every individual person.","classification":4,"fold":0}

The violin playing adds a pretty tone to this track too.  \"Hallelujah\" is one of most of the covered songs out there, but Susan's rendition of this song is special and uplifting.  I love the goregous piano playing on this track.  \"Do You Hear What I Hear\" is another highlight here. This is the best Christmas duet I have ever heard.  Amber Stassi has a very pretty voice.  \"Auld Lang Syne\" is a song that puts me in a sentimental mood.  I think about all the friends I have lost this year when I listen to this song.  Susan Boyle's cover is moving.  She makes this song her own, and that is a mark of a talented singer.  I am not a very religious person, but I love the way Susan sings \"O Holy Night\" and \"Away In A Manger\"  These  song give me chicken skin.  My least favorite track is \"Don't Dream It's Over\".

{"text":"There is no question of why Phil Collins has a lot to celebrate. Musically, he has been celebrating the 35th anniversary of Face Value being released, and Phil had re-issued his entire catalog from beginning to end. His songs really sound better than ever, and he has really introduced himself nicely to the so-called Beyonce' and Rihanna generation that has been all about the product on the outside, not the person on the inside making the music. Phil had been making music for over 45 years on his own and with Genesis, and he has definitely been one of the more quintessential entertainers that I love, not only because of his musicianship, but how very strong his songs have been over the years. It all honestly started with one song that was all about heartbreak, In The Air Tonight. The song is still just as haunting and hypnotic at the very dark soul as it was when it was released back in 1981. Phil definitely had strong feelings about divorce and definite sadness and angst, and he used it very well in song. If you had never heard a Phil Collins song before, than this is one I sincerely recommend you listen to first.\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I am a huge fan, Of Floyd and the Collective. Each, (Waters and Gilmore ) MADE THE FLOYD... This release.. I so very much WANTED to like, But, over all, I was left wanting... This is another self indulgent Rant,Ramble, and Rave, set to a dull monotonous undertone.. So much of the recording is effect, and Unpleasant background noise. VERY LITTLE MUSIC AT ALL ! Unlike a Gilmore release, which is still Poignant, and challenges the listener to listen, think, yet STILL enjoy !!\nThe high points of this disk are  \"Smell the roses\", a distinct nod to past Floyd brilliance, Then \"Oceans apart which transcends into Wait for her,\n(( which, if you listen is Just Floyd's song \"MOTHER\", re-penned.. )) but still worth the listen.\nOver all, this is Pablum..\nI like the spoken word commentary, and Rogers biting sarcasm and wit, yet, when I am Buying a MUSIC CD.. i expect just that.. MUSIC...\nWe listen to music to get away from the injustice and Terror of the day. NOT have it further shoved in our face.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"This is a well crafted CD release by the legendary hard rock band Warrant, titled 'Rockaholic'. While many hard rock bands that started with them in the 80s may have disappeared, Warrant is still going strong despite line-up changes & delivers well in this new CD (14 tracks). The songs are well balanced (mixture of mid-tempo tracks & ballads), good compositions & well produced. Stand-outs\/gems\/solid tracks include \"Innocence Gone\" (beautiful very commanding vocals & melodic guitars), \"Home\" (a wonderful ballad, inspirational lyrics, very melodical sound & vocals), \"Life's A Song\" (mid-tempo track with a build-up to a beautiful cresendo, great melody & vocals), \"Found Forever\" (a wonderful ballad with great melody & chorus) & \"Tears In The City\" (another ballad with incredible melody, harmonies & vocals). CD filler\/okay track for me is \"Candy Man\". Great tracks include \"Sex Ain't Love\" (mid-tempo track, great melody & vocals), \"Snake\", \"Dusty's Revenge\" (melodical guitars), \"What Love Can Do\", \"Show Must Go On\", \"Cocaine Freight Train, \"Sunshine\" & \"The Last Straw\". The band Warrant in this CD 'Rockaholic' covers the usual hard rock subjects of love\/sex, drugs & having great fun. The band is certainly still going strong, their fans should be delighted with this well crafted CD release, a highly recommended CD listening.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"This album was released in the UK and Canada in late 2001, and in the US in early 2002. The main difference is the US version has a track called \"When You Walk Away\", and the UK\/Canadian printings have a great song called \"You Take It All\" instead of \"When You Walk Away\", and vice versa for the US. LIVING PROOF is a great album that builds on the strength of BELIEVE, however this album never really lived to its potential, it didn't catch on as much as BELIEVE did to listeners. \"Song For The Lonely\" was a song that really resonated with a lot of people, with it's universal theme. In fact, a lot of the songs were like the ones on BELIEVE, with a message of strength and survival through life's difficult stages. As a whole, this album is better than BELIEVE. The only tracks I could have done without is the R&B tinged \"Rain Rain\" and the Diane Warren latin infused \"Body To Body, Heart To Heart\". The rest of the album is just great. I actually like Cher's version of Amber's \"Love One Another\", more than Amber's version. \"Love Is A Lonely Place Without You\" is like an epic ballad dance song, should have been a single. \"Real Love\" is a really funky Daft Punk sounding song, very european. \"Alive Again\" and \"A Different Kind Of Love Song\" are other highlights, with great positive messages. Other highlights include \"You Take It All\" (one of the best on the album) and \"When The Money's Gone\". Overall a really strong album from Cher! Can't wait to see what she does next.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"1982 was the year of The Hellion!\nReturning with a vengeance, Priest recorded what is now a testament to heavy-metal history. Their previous outing, 'Point of Entry' didn't exactly set the world on fire. But if there was any doubt that they were going to conquer America, it was completely obliterated with 'Screaming For Vengeance.'  The only time this album pauses for air is during 'Fever'.  By the time this landmark album was released, the band had fully embraced their sharp-edged sound and image. After this tour, Judas Priest was a household name. My uncle asked me in '82 what I was listening to one day on my Stereo. I said, \"Judas Priest\". He answered, \"Judas Priest? Oh ,for the love of God...Turn it down!\" A  truly amazing album which spawned the classics, \"You've Got Another Thing Coming\" and \"Electric Eye.\"  This 30 year salute is incredible- Check out the bonus trax from their 1982 World Vengeance Tour.","classification":5,"fold":0}

I mean, I used to LOVE this album when it originally came out in 1980. I played it over and over in those days.\n\"Arc of a Diver\" (7 tracks, 40 min.) contains the hits \"While You See a Chance\" and \"Second-Hand Woman\", and the title track is well known too, but it all sounds a bit... 80s synth-lite now. The only track that really remains a stand-out now is the brooding, grooving \"Night Train\".\nThis album set the stage for the commercial blockbusters \"Back in the High Life\" and \"Roll With It\".

All in all, it's a story about relationships.  I also concluded that this was a recording about that this thing that some artists go thru, and that thing is called growth.  Where it works for some, for others like Ne-Yo, it took a step or two or three back.  It's also not needed for rappers to appear if you are an established artist.  Sometimes it can take a turn that's not needed.  It would have been a 3.5 if not for the track TIME OF OUR LIVES with Pitbull.  THAT TRACK GAVE ME LIFE!!!  On a whole, the fun has been somewhat stripped from this release.  It was good after 3 spins, but now, I'm done.","classification":4,"fold":0}

Musically, she or her producer, Hal Willner, has taken a few positive strides.\n\nI do agree with others the lead-off track is one of the weakest on this disk. The repetativeness is completely distracting and not worthy of Willams' talents.  Ditto w\/\"Mama You Sweet\".\n\nThe strongest tracks are by far \"Unsuffer Me\", \"Where is My Love\", \"Rescue\", \"What If\" and \"Wrap My Head Around It\".  Especially the strings on \"Unsuffer Me\" and the guitar on \"Where is My Love\" really make the songs.  They are subtle yet make all the difference.\n\nI do like \"Fancy Funeral\", though it is a little down...even for me.  \"Come On\" starts really good, but it doesn't really go anywhere.\n\nThe good thing is, the rest of the songs are perfectly serviceable.  Nothing outstanding, but nothing making me hit the 'skip' button like I did with 'World Without Tears'.","classification":4,"fold":0}

Even in his early teens Bobby Darin knew just what he wanted to do with his life. He craved the spotlight and realized early on that music was in his blood. Not only did he love to sing and perform before live audiences but he was also an extremely gifted songwriter and a talented musician as well. And because of his serious medical condition he was determined to make a name for himself before the age of 25. Well lo and behold Bobby Darin did just that!! In the decade between 1958 and 1968 he churned out more than 40 singles. Several were major hits including his signature tune \"Mack The Knife\". Perhaps my favorite Darin recording is his big 1960 hit \"Beyond The Sea\". This was the stuff of night clubs and Broadway shows. Audiences loved it and the record zoomed to #6 on the national charts. Don't hear this much on the radio anymore but when I do I crank up the sound!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"When I first heard Mushroomhead XIII they were a metal group with a touch of melody for good measure. Two discs later, they are a melodic group with a touch of metal thrown in for good measure. There may not be three part harmonies and such going, but the sound is much crisper and the thrash is gone and the screaming is considerably less. Not to mention they released a single, \"Come On\" that most old school Shroomheads despise, because of what a blatant attempt it is at mainstream success.\n\n For me personally, I enjoy the song. In fact I enjoy a little over half their new cd. Songs like \"Slaughterhouse Road\", \"Build The Bridge\", and \"Harvest The Garden\" do get the blood pumping a bit. Maybe not like \"Sun Doesn't Rise\", \"12 Hundred\", or \"Kill Tomorrow\", but they are still solid tracks. For what this cd does right though, it almost does as much wrong. The last half of the cd is plagued by songs like \"Holes In The Void\" or \"Do I Know You\" that lack any kind of redeeming quality or atmosphere to draw you in. \"The Harm You Do\" feels bland, while \"The Feel\" suffers from more ridiculous lyrics than those of the lead off single \"Come On\".\n\nIn closing, I have no problem really with Mushroomhead's transition to a more mainstream sound, though I'm sure alot of the fans of their material up through XIII will\/do. My issue is that the last two cds suffer from terrible inconsistency, making them just average cd. The potential is still there, which is apparent on the tracks I listed earlier and a few others. I just wish the group took full advantage, much like they did on XIII.","classification":3,"fold":0}

Bringing back the Buggles (Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes) was a stroke of genius; and as I see it (...or hear it), it's DRAMA part 2. The only down side for me, was that there was no re-recording of 1980's \"Go Through This,\" which would have been a nice rocker for the second half of this album. As for the sound quality, it is very good and I'm sure it would have sounded even better with a little less compression in the mastering stage.

{"text":"Back in 1979, I had Bonnie Pointers HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU song on one of those K-tel compilation albums and thought it was an ok hybrid of Disco and vintage Motown but I found her voice kind of thin and reedy not unlike Diana Ross.  When Big Break Records released this remastered deluxe CD I decided to make a blind-buy purchase since I loved what they had done with a large chunk of the Pointer Sisters catalog.\n\nAt first I wasn't that impressed, but this album has grown on me and so have Bonnies vocal stylings. She displays such versatility here as she tackles lite jazz on FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM, another retro Motown offering on WHEN IM GONE and some red-hot funky R&B on AH SHOOT. But my favorites on the album are the stripped-down, acoustic numbers MORE AND MORE, I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, I WANNA MAKE IT (IN YOUR WORLD) and the piano ballad MY EVERYTHING. These are just beautiful in their simplicity and allow Bonnies voice to shine through and really move the listener.\n\nSound quality is terrific on this remaster and best of all is that theyve included the 12 versions and single versions of FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM and HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU. Both are better than the album versions with a hot bass-driven break in the former but the latter must be heard to be believedits an extended mix that has this mesmerizing instrumental interlude where the frantically-scrubbed guitars and screeching violins battle it out. It sounds like something out of the famous PSYCHO shower scene and will give you goosebumps.\n\nThis albums a grower and is definitely the best of the solo Pointer Sisters offerings.

Grouped them in with poser metal like Limp Biskit, Korn, etc. To be fair, Deftones kind of appeals to both crowds- the underground kids and the mainstream kids. Personally, I never was that crazy about them. Just another band. 'Diamond Eyes' really changed my opinion though. Then they put out the Japanese album which was total garbage, and I figured they were all done.\n\nNow to this album. Some albums, it takes me a long time to get into. As soon as I heard this, it blew me away. It's that good. Now, we all come from different walks and different experiences. I grew up in the 90's hardcore scene. To me, this sounds a lot like the music that was coming out in the early to late 90's. Worlds Collide, Into Another, Life of Agony, Leeway, Vision of Disorder. I hear elements of all those bands in here.\n\nAlso, past Deftones album have had one or two keeper songs. Even Bright Eyes, as good as it was, had a few throw away songs.

Is this one of those stupid cross-label things? Because those are really annoying. And this contains Boogie Wonderland, most likely their worst hit, either that or Let's Groove. Both are disco. Not a coincidence. And they drop All About Love, as well as I'll Write a Song for You. Give me a break! Four of their greatest songs, dropped off a cliff. Splat. Why? Saturday Night's an OK song, but I don't see it as the Best of Earth Wind and Fire. But if you swap those three off, put the four I mentioned on, and keep the rest, you've got the real best of Earth, Wind and Fire. Unlike the 1978 Greatest Hits release, this DOES contain Mighty Mighty, Kalimba Story AND Serpentine Fire, three essentials. Plus it adds After the Love is Gone, a worthy addition to any self-respecting EWF hits collection (or at least any one released after 1978), and their greatest song ever maybe. I'd bet on it. Plus nine of the ten tracks on the '78 release, not coincidentially the nine classics (Got to Get You Into My Life, Fantasy, Can't Hide Love, Getaway, That's the Way of the World, Shining Star, September, Reasons, Sing a Song) - note how they dropped Love Music, which is cool by me because it's just an average song and average songs don't belong on best-ofs, even if they were huge hits (*cough cough Saturday Nite*).\n\nYes, this is a great intro, but don't stop here.

He really has been knocking it out of the ballpark in regards to his songs and heart. But nevertheless, he has a whole lot more to continue to delivering in the way he has had some excellent songs. His latest song, Like I Can, the fourth single from his Grammy-winning album In The Lonely Hour, is a song that works very nicely for him, and delivers very well in the pop style that maybe someone like Phil Collins had developed over the years of his brilliance with songwriting. It is a good song, while I honestly do wish that the song could've been a bit longer to match the mood he set within the song. Still, it is a great treat for those whom have loved Sam's songs before.

I read online that there was a controversy on exactly what the song is about.  There are a variant of controversial statements posted online on what he might have meant by this song.  I personally think that the lead singer actually had the best intentions in mind when recording this very compelling song.  It appears to be about sex, but when you listen to it there can be several meanings depending on how one was raised. I personally think that he was only trying to send an informative message on how the desire for power shapes a persons behavior.  Regardless, this is actually a good song and one that is still interesting to listen to even after all the years that passed since it has been released (1992(.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"In the span of time from their debut to their second album, \"Love Drunk,\" Boys Like Girls jump from punk-pop emo band to all out boy band power pop. This is not a completely bad thing, as the super sugar choruses and duet with Taylor Swift show. But the evolution is not without some speed bumps.\n\nFirst off, the good stuff. The lead off track, \"Heart Heart Heartbreak\" is pure adrenaline hormonal rush. The repetitive title kills it in the chorus, making for a great little earworm. Then the title track revisits the zing of their debut. Then comes the head scratcher. \"Two Is Better Than One\" is a ballad, but strip some of the electricity out of it and factor in Taylor Swift, and you have a country tune that would have fit just as nicely on one of Swift's albums than it does here. It also shows that lead singer\/guitarist Martin Johnson can work his way around a sappy ballad with the best of them. It's the hookier tunes that play to the band's punkier roots, like \"Contagious\" that work the best.\n\nThat's where things go somewhat awry. Propulsive emo-pop and power pop are great for the guys that need girls and the girls that break their hearts. But the new addition of strings and syrup (like the closer, \"Go,\" which limps the album to its end) make for the kind of song the band isn't quite up to yet. Add a southern accent and ditch the auto-tune, and these would be country ballads. While they make this country pop hybrid work much better on the follow-up, \"Crazy World,\" it's a tough sell on \"Love Drunk.\" It's as if Boys Like Girls suddenly took on a split personality and couldn't decide it they wanted to stay true to their Boston Emo roots or just pack up the cats and relocate to Nashville.\n\nThat's the issue with \"Love Drunk.\" You get two distinct bands on this album, the whiz-bang pop of the debut, and the country-pop that would dominate the next album. Boys Like Girls were in transition, and while \"Love Drunk\" did debut in the top ten, their three albums are essentially the work in progress of differing mindsets. There's plenty to like on the album. What there isn't? Consistency. Hence the solid C grade.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"I was long expecting Detox.  When he suddenly announced it was shelved and was instead releasing this companion album to the Straight Outta Compton film I was disappointed but at the same time relieved to have something new at least.  Here's a problem.  Dr Dre was such a snobby pr*ck about this albums release method.  He is the first music billionaire yet he decided to make this an Apple Music exclusive for two full weeks.  I don't use Apple Music and probably never will.  It was a wimpy move in music.  I couldn't find the album online and didn't want to risk any viruses from downloading it elsewhere plus I didn't have the time to worry about it.  So I waited the two weeks for it to be released on CD.  Still no freemium Spotify though?  Gosh Dre really is a @#$%.  Anyways leading up to the CD release I read many reviews.  It was universally loved by the critics.  I couldn't wait to hear Dres supposed final masterpiece.  After finally having it in my grasp, it was clear that the critics were probably on Dres payroll.  This album isn't a masterpiece.  It isn't bad either.  It's just good.  And 'just good' wasn't worth all the hype.\n\nFirst off, the production on the album is crisp and smooth and of course full of soulful funk.  But here's the thing, it was all very forgettable.  I listened to the album over 5 times to let it seep in fully.  Still not amazing.  Not what the critics made the album out to be.  Its funny nowadays most of the time when critics hate an album the fans love it.  This is one of those rare times when critics love the album, but though the fans don't really hate it, I can see many others aren't as impressed either.  This truly was Dre trying too hard to sound relevant after 16 years between albums.  Like I said, the sound of the album is nice and modern, but just not special.  Weird since Dre is known for his high standards and perfectionism.  Now to Dres rapping.  He was decent but he sounded like he was the guest on someone elses song on each song.  There are even two songs he isn't even on???  The topics just made me roll my eyes.  The choruses were catchy but also strangely unappealing.  When I saw it on Amazon it was listed at the time as the number one bestseller in POP Rap.  That explains the sound perfectly.  I like catchy feelgood soft pop rap, but not from someone like Dr Dre.  Like I said, this album barely had Dre rapping on it.  It was like a Calvin Harris album where he thought production was enough to stamp his name on it.  The guests steal the show almost 99% of the time.  Which is good and bad.  There will be people who just love the album but I'm sure more people will toss it aside after a week or two or maybe less.  In a world were new music is constantly shifting and pushing boundaries and blowing minds, this album was just a letdown, especially by Dres standards and the hype.  Honestly even if the album wasn't hyped up I probably wouldn't be impressed still.  I'm sure it took a lot of work for Dre and company to put these songs together, but does that mean it payed off?  I don't think so.\n\nDre worries about making money so much yet this album quickly declined in sales.  The Apple Music exclusive sold a robust 300,000 in its first week.  But even after the actual CD release it was apparent that many weren't buying it anymore.  This album will barely go Gold(500,000), which is still good for others standards, but not for someone who was supposed to be a mega seller.  Maybe Dre should revisit Detox and finish that.","classification":3,"fold":0}

A good way to determine if you might like this song is to listen to Higher Ground also by Red Hot Chili Peppers (due to Dark Necessities being a brilliant gem that channels the well done music experimentation of Higher Ground).","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I saw BEAUTIFUL: THE CAROLE KING STORY musical last weekend in Los Angeles and I was blown away. It should've been called the \"Goffin & King and Mann & Weil story\" because the musical focuses on the two couples and their friendship, and were responsible for much of the soundtrack of the 1960s that didn't come from Motown or The Beatles.\n\nEven though Jessie Mueller (\"Carole King\") wasn't in the Los Angeles production, Abby Mueller was in the starring role (I don't know if they're related but they do sound a lot alike and sound like King), I had to have the soundtrack, which I bought at the Pantages.\n\nAnyway, the CD captures the excitement from the show and it comes with a booklet with liner notes from Douglas McGrath (the play's writer) who describes how he came about telling the story. It also contains a synopsis of the play and where the musical numbers come in, so you don't have to have seen it to understand what's going on. There are also pictures of the real Carole King, Gerry Goffin, Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann, as well as pictures from the Broadway cast.\n\nThe show is touring so if you haven't seen it yet, I recommend it. But if you can't make it BEAUTIFUL: THE CAROLE KING MUSICAL CD is the next best thing. If you want to hear the real King and some of the groups that made Goffin & King's songs famous, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Essential-Carole-King\/dp\/B003C5FMO4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Essential Carole King<\/a>&nbsp;which has 2 CDs (the first focuses on Carole with her singing and the second CD has the various original artists who made the song hits).","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"It is sincerely so sad that when a artist has been so overexposed, that the quality of their voice has slowly and surely passed away. Beyonce' Knowles has been severely so oversaturated, that the quality of her own work has been severely annoying than really enjoyable. When she had pulled out a surprise record, many people were more interested in the product than took a strong listen to the person behind it. For her collaborations with her husband Jay-Z, they have became too much of the same thing where they have been more like lackluster chemistry than really striking while the voices could be hot. Drunk In Love which was the lead single from her self-titled surprise record, has really been more of a drag out of the numerous songs they have done together like Crazy In Love and Deja Vu. I really didn't find the song to be a good match for the two of them. I found this song to be more annoying than drive it all the way home. Perhaps Beyonce' should take more patience into her music, than rush it out and pull surprises for her voice.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":0}

{"text":"Do I hate this record? Would I play it with windows down and \"normal\" people within earshot? Is this just the latest in a long line of post-Pitchfork flavor of the month bands? Meh. Who cares. The real question is this: does not liking a record like Yeasayer's Odd Blood mean that I'm losing my edge? Having just turned 30, I've found myself obsessively asking this question about almost everything. Does the fact that I don't like Coconut M&Ms - or the reality that \"Breaking Bad\" makes me feel nauseated with anxiety - mean that I'm not changing with the times? Am I becoming what I've always feared: the \"Better In My Day\" \/ \"All Been Done\" guy? Is my palate not as endlessly open to new things as I've always claimed?\n\nNo way. I'm not losing it, I'm just selective. I mean, I loved last year's Animal Collective and Dirty Projector records and cite Joanna Newsom's *Ys as one of the best records of the new century. I might not be covered in tattoos but I've always laughed at the Johnny Come Lately kids who fall victim to awful hip-hop and electronic music fads. I don't collect goofy sunglasses and didn't wear the \"Buddy Holly specs\" (as we called them in 1994) after the first Weezer record came out. Hmm ... maybe that's why I think Odd Blood is one of the ugliest looking records I've ever seen? And maybe the fact that I listen to music on an actual stereo and not an iPhone has something to do with why I think Odd Blood is so laughably experimental and unfocused. Experimental to a fault, even. Or maybe I'm just too old to matter. Meh.\n\nLet's start with the vocals and vocal treatments, which are often awful. Opener \"The Children\" finds singers Chris Keating and Anand Wilder's vocals so drenched in effects that the song has no real personality - a shame, considering how interesting the loopy arrangement is. Track two, \"Ambling Alp,\" again features heavily treated vocals over an otherworldly arrangement. These are the vocals of someone who takes what they're doing very seriously, which is often the worst trait for someone attempting to make groundbreaking art. And I'm not talking James Murphy when I say \"serious,\" I'm talking Chris Martin - Kanye, even. It's all a shame, really, considering how good the melodies often are and how interesting some of the accompaniments can be.\n\nAnyone who heard and loved Yeasayer's 2007 debut, All Hour Cymbals, was surely looking forward to the flawed Odd Blood. And while many of the hallmarks are still here, including the whole \"future tribal\" vibe, Blood is the sound of a band working incredibly hard - yet never quite finding their focus. Instead of building on their sound these psychedelic Brooklynites attempt to reinvent themselves through experimentation, even claiming that they, while experimenting with LSD in New Zealand, decided to make a poppier record.\n\nBack to that \"experimental to a fault\" thing. The 22-year-old version of me would never say such a thing. But when I listen to Odd Blood, I hear great, great things. The ideas are here, but damn if they're not lost in the mud of the band's everything-at-once approach. The easiest reference for the record's sound would be Animal Collective's Feels, the difference being that the Animals would never be caught dead with such cheesy vocals. Another reference would be Odd Nosdam's solo records and the earliest Why? records Nosdam worked on with Yoni Wolf - back before that band got all indie rock on us. Or how about mid-era Talking Heads if they were even more wimpy and overly-produced.\n\nMy hunch is that if you are a person who likes modern indie records and plays music yourself, Odd Blood might blow your mind. It might even influence you. But it's also my opinion that, even if you are this rare person who loves Odd Blood for it wild ideas and deep production, you won't hold the high opinion in, say, a year. In fact, I don't think anyone will love this record for very long. Like it? Sure. Be influenced by it? Some. Have your mind blown by the production and creativity found throughout the record's 40 minutes? Many, including this writer. But put Odd Blood on, turn it up and love what's coming out of the speakers? Nah. Not likely. Not after the initial impression is established.\n\nAll that said, this is one of the most listenable and interesting global trip-hop records ever made. That counts for something.","classification":3,"fold":0}

She was trying to get my mind off of what had happened a few days before when Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\" came on.\n\nBefore I even had time to think about it, we looked at each other and started \"car dancing\", you know, you're bustin' a move while moving at a high rate of speed, singing at the top of your lungs, laughing, crying and just having fun.  People driving past us would look over and smile, or laugh, some even paced themselves alongside us and broke out in their own car dancing moves.\n\nI didn't stop and think about what people would think if they knew my husband had just died.  I didn't stop and think about anything except the moment me and my best friend were in, \"Girl's just having fun\".\n\nThe lyrics are easy to pick up, sing along with and dance to and the video was great.\n\nI believe that if more girls just wanted to have that sort of carefree silly fun, the world might be a little less uptight.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Angels and Airwaves was a band that was created by former Blink 182 singer\/guitarist Tom Delonge and his ambition to create something truly different was very admirable. The band's debut CD, We Don't Need to Whisper, was a very good CD that unfortunately suffered from a bit of a slow pace and some weak lyrics. But still, it was a great start and I was very interested to see the band's follow up CD, I-Empire. I-Empire (called by Tom \"the \"part 2\" to We Don't Need to Whisper) is a much faster CD that's a lot more accessible and easier to like. The music on here is really uplifting, and it's perfect music for playing VERY loud, especially on a nice sound system or while driving fast in a car. It's definitely a much better CD than the 1st effort. That said, though, it still suffers from some of the flaws of We Don't Need to Whisper; the lyrics have not improved; in fact, they've gotten even a bit worse. I think Tom needs a new approach to his lyric writing for this band; I thought it was weird during their first CD that the music is this futuristic, very \"epic and different\" in style, and presented itself as a grandoise and epic masterpiece...yet the songs were about \"your best friend is not your girlfriend\" ...it didn't work. I-Empire's faster music fits its lyrics a lot better, but unfortunately, the lyrics on here are often extremely corny, and almost every single song's a love song. I really wish Tom would try to sing about something else, as his \"I love you, you make me feel alive\" lyrics really started to get old for me on this CD. Blink 182's self-titled final CD featured some excellent lyrics and the songs showed real variety in their subject matter; Angels and Airwaves is about love, that's it. Only a couple tracks on this CD seem to deviate from that. That aside, though, this CD shows much more variety in the songs and much more exciting music and it easily makes it a more fun listen.\n\nCall to Arms; 8\/10. A very cool start to the CD. Some nice lyrics and a catchy chorus. A good song.\n\nEverything's Magic; 7\/10. Another good song, a very fast-paced and fun song; the lead single. Features great music that sounds a bit like Blink 182's Anthem Part 2. The chorus isn't too great, though.\n\nBreathe; 8\/10; A very nice song musically. The first slow song on the CD yet it's not unbearably slow. It's a little repetative lyrically, (he says \"I love you\" over 16 times in it,) but it's a really nice and ambient song. Well-done.\n\nLove Like Rockets; 7\/10; Although the subject matter of the song's a little stupid when you think about it, it's a cool-sounding and \"different\" song with a pretty cool chorus. The song's got a cool space-like theme to it. The \"imagine\" line's pretty cool. Overall, it works. Has a cool, powerful ending, too.\n\nSirens; 7\/10; Took me a while to get used to this song, (the \"dadadadada\" lyrics got on my nerves at first,) but now it's actually pretty good. The whole song's very catchy and the verses are sung very well. Good lyrics, actually.\n\nSecret Crowds; 6\/10; This is more of a \"rock song,\" that sounds like it'd be perfectly played in a football stadium. It's not too bad lyrically, (providing the theme for the CD; \"If I had my own world, I'd build you an empire,\")and the verses are pretty nice, but there's unfortunately no hook here; the big refrain of the song doesn't have any sort of tune, it just features Tom singing slower and louder. It needed more of a tune or a hook. The band obviously disagrees, though, since this is currently the planned 2nd single.\n\nStar of Bethlehem; 7\/10; When Angels and Airwaves first played this song live, it was an epic, 6-minute plus song with a very long instrumental at the beginning with the lyrics eventually kicking in at about the 3-minute mark. For the CD, the song was wisely split up; most of the long instrumental takes place in this song, while the rest of the song kicks in on the next track, True Love. This is a pretty cool instrumental, both atmospheric and fast, as well as very memorable. Goes very well with the next song.\n\nTrue Love; 8\/10; Another great song, with a very fast chorus and featuring the continuing instrumental from the previous song. Lyrics are pretty cool. Another song that's definitely got more of a \"rock\" sound to it. Well-done.\n\nLifeline; 3\/10; Really irritating song, the only bad one on the CD. Tom's vocals on this song are horrible; he REALLY strains on it and it just sounds very forced and corny. Really bad lyrics, too. Easily the worst song on the 2 CD's. Musically it's pretty weak, too. The verses have a good tune but unfortunately Tom's strained vocals end up making the song pretty intolerable.\n\nJumping Rooftops; NA\/10; a cool little techno intermission as we transition into the powerful final tracks on the CD.\n\nRite of Spring; 8\/10; It's hard for me to give this an 8\/10 because the lyrics are really horrible; it's too bad because it's actually very good subject matter; Tom talking about his life, with a really cool chorus and verses; overall a very catchy and really impressive song musically, but the lyrics are pretty awful. Tom tries to rhyme to really bad results, and we end up with a song that tries to rhyme \"pass\" with \"cash\" and lines like \"it took about an hour to start a punk rock band, to offset my ****** up family land.\" Had he not tried to rhyme I think we would have ended up with a MUCH better song lyrically, but still, it's a great song and one of the most memorable on the CD.\n\nHeaven; 10\/10; An excellent end to I-Empire with the best lyrics on the CD. It starts by sampling distorted clips from past Angels and Airwaves songs, then speeds up. Very great musically, very good lyrically. Serves almost as a part 2 to the apocalyptic Valkyrie Missile from We Don't Need to Whisper and it's overall a cool closing to the story told on the band's first 2 CD's.\n\nAngels and Airwaves have greated a great \"part 2\" to their first CD that's both faster and more fun. Now that they've finished this story, though, I hope their next CD's something completely different entirely, especially in the lyrical department. I'd like to see this band sing about some different subjects at some point. Easily recommended for anyone who'se ever been a fan of Tom's work in the past of if you like this \"stadium rock\" genre.\n\nThat said, I have to end this review on a negative note. After listening to the recently released \"In Defense of the Genre\" CD by rock band Say Anything, I've gotta say that THIS is a band whose lyrics are real, whose lyrics are true to life and whose lyrics are layered and very deep, and whose lyrics really mean something to the band. Tom Delonge's lyrics for Angels and Airwaves, on the other hand, are so far removed from any type of reality and are so formulaic and so cliche'd that it gives his songs the depth of a shallow pool...it's like listening to the boy bands of the 1990's again....yeesh. He just seems unwilling (or unable) to stretch himself at all in this category and it was such a step down on this CD from Whisper, which was itself a step down from where Blink left off from on their excellent final CD. The lack of emotional weight on these songs and true hooks ended up making the CD fairly forgettable. I liked Rite of Spring a lot because despite its horrible lyrics, it was nice to hear Tom finally sing about something that was obviously real life. Despite these complaints, this gets a 4-star rating. It's a good CD and fans of Angels and Airwaves fans SHOULD definitely check it out. But don't expect it to remain in your CD players for long....It's more exciting than Whisper, but just not nearly as memorable. Here's hoping the band switches gears with their next CD.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Others have said it in their own amazon reviews -- Bruce does not approach the grandeur of the musical and lyrical feats of his younger days. So many classical composers got better, deeper, richer as they grew older. I do not understand why the same is rarely the case for pop musicians.\n\nMy best friend (a longtime Cockburn fan who went to some lengths to see him live last year, and was very pleased) told me it was an effort for him to get through this album. I did not find that to be so. I actually found it a pleasant listen. Track one is bouncy and witty, though not soaringly poetic. While not actually joyful, it is upbeat or happily ironic at least. It's as if Cockburn has learned to laugh again -- he seemed so dire there for a time. The second song does not impress me musically, and \"It's not what I would have chose\" sounds like rather clunky syntax, but at least there's a playfulness about it.\n\nIf the songs on Small Source Of Comfort really must be heard ten times to appreciate, then I'm afraid I will never know their full goodness. After nearly four decades of critical music listening, I think I can latch on to what is good and bad about most songs very quickly. Repeated listens merely remind me of those successes and flaws I heard the first time. I would love to report that Cockburn is back in full force here, but it doesn't seem that way to me. I'll go back to the old albums.\n\nIf you desperately need a fix of new Cockburn, this is it. His voice has held up extremely well, his guitar playing is as nimble as ever, he sings about the topics he's always been singing about. I'll just say that I prefer his material from six albums on either side of Dancing In the Dragons Jaws and leave it at that.","classification":3,"fold":0}

Yes it helps if you have the right system, but none the less I am sure this baby would sound great on most stereos.

{"text":"Ordinarily I don't write a review for items with over say, 5 reviews.  But, not surprisingly, this record gets love it or hate it reviews.  All hardcore punk rock enthusiasts love it (how can you not?) and all heaven's to Murgatroid alt post punk lovin' musical sweethearts (we could use other terms but maybe you get the idea?  Sure we do) hate it because it is so intense and unrelenting.\n\n1) There's less time between songs on this baby than possibly any other record.  Cool man.\n\n2) Actually, it's very fast rock.  That may not be obvious.  If you slowed this stuff down it'd just be a rock 'n roll album.  But the breakneck pace launches it into the world of hardcore punk rock.  Virtually by the speed of the music alone.  Let's just say that 24 or so years after its release it still deserves its title of a speed record.  Sure, there's probably some bands that have performed faster (NEIGHBORS of San Diego did a 22 song set in about 24 minutes about 4 years ago and I thought the singer would have an anurism - that his blood vessels would explode - while he was singing and the other 4 band members were each going at maximum possible speed every single song.  By the time the set was over everyone in the place was fully satisfied.  I still regret not video taping that gig.  Unbelievable).  But for the year this came out it was stupendously stunning then and I'll still put it on once a year or so and revel in its full out blasting of some high quality music.\n\n3) Sure, it's not the highest quality recording quality.  Although it's actually higher than a bunch of punk rock that was released back in the day - late 70's, early 80's.  Mainly cuz so much of it was Do It Yourself.  Think about it, SST is a giant indie punk rock label.  They remained, all these years, and certainly then, a label for and by punx with a very eclectic range.  Ok, so most of their records blew.  But this is a classic that will stand the test of time.  Of course, so will SST's BLACK FLAG Damaged and earlier records and their MINUTEMEN records.  Virtually everything else they released is suspect (see HUSKER DU's post Everything Falls Apart records as a for instance, yuk).\n\nWhen big business is not involved,\n\nA) the artist makes what they want, with no filtering by big business producers trying to make the music more appealing to the masses ie. watering it down, popifying it\n\nB) there is less money to work with so live recordings like this one don't always get recorded with expensive equipment so the recording quality is less than what we're used to hearing from big name artists and\n\nC) there's fewer copies of DIY records because only a thousand or 10,000 are made rather than 500,000 copies.  As it is, this recording quality is quite nice compared to a number of other DIY punk live releases.  Quite listenable I'd say and I don't care to hear poorly recorded live recordings.\n\nThank you SST and HUSKER DU for making something that still today brings a mighty smile to my face and 1000's of other hardcore fans today and into the future.  The rest of you who can't take this sort of thing, don't.  Go buy a nice GUIDED BY VOICES album.  The existance of this album doesn't diminish what HUSKER DU did later.  It just shows us they sailed a different ship and left us this, their one pure classic.  DRI and DIE KREUZEN, each with an amazing first 7\" of defining, everlasting pure hardcore and then both bands just flaked off into, well, they left and made music that is still an embarrasement to listen to, at least to a punk.  chrisbct@hotmail.com","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Robert Plant continues to be on a creative roll with this most recent collection.  I am not sure that World Music is the best way to describe the material on this album, but it certainly covers a wide array of musical styles and textures and is influenced by a myriad of geographical references.  I have seen quite a few reviews where people mention that they did not like the album at first, but with repeated listens, (or different listening circumstances) it grew on them to the point where they enjoyed it.  This is understandable as the album contains a lot of subtle charms that are not necessarily on the surface upon first listen.  In fact I would say this is true of many of Plants more recent efforts.  They are not going to knock you over the head, but will win you over.  I enjoy every track on this one.  Led Zeppelin it isnt, but Plant jumped off that train years ago.  This album is mature rock oriented music that proves that one of the great voices of rock n roll can still deliver the goods from both a vocal and songwriting perspective.  Great stuff.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Fifty years ago when I first started listening to classical music I loved Tchaikovsky. The melodies were so beautiful and passionate. The occassional bombast at that point did not bother me.  I would strongly recommend starting off with ballet music from Swan Lake and the Nutcracker. From there I would listen to Symphonies number 4,5, and 6. This is great music, decently performed, and recorded. If you want to spend more money you can obtain better audiophile recordings with big name orchestras and chamber groups but these performances for the most part are very acceptable. You can listen to them from the cloud from virtually anywhere you can get a signal or download them. Right now I am listening to John Lill performing the piano concerto from this volume. It is very well done. I am glad I spent the 99 cents. You get to listen to a lot of great music and it costs you almost nothing.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Dylan's career epitomizes change. He has buffeted and tossed fans around on a wild sea of change and reinvention since 1965 (when he picked up an electric guitar in defiance of the folk community's unwritten rules). The year 1979 saw his most shocking transition. One that challenged and threatened Dylan's career like no other. Dylan began espousing Christianity and throwing around the term \"born again\". Jerry Wexler, who produced \"Slow Train Coming\", told Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin that \"I had no idea he was on this born-again Christian trip until he started to evangelize me.\" Wexler diplomatically told Dylan to back off, but he produced the album anyway. So in the heyday of punk the performer many people associated, fairly or unfairly, with 1960s \"radicalism\" turned explicitly Christian. Not only that, 1978's \"Street Legal\" met with an extremely icy reception. For many fans Dylan's new \"phase\" was too much.\n\nDylan's \"Christian phase\" (though arguably not a phase) now looks somewhat innocuous from a historical perspective. After two (some say one, some say three) more \"Christian\" albums, Dylan's lyrics morphed once again. Would his career have survived had he plunged permanently into Christian music? Hard to say. Many thought he was through in 1965. He may have simply found a different audience (though in the 1970s that audience would probably have been a small one). Regardless, the 1980s were probably the low point of Dylan's career from many perspectives.\n\n\"Slow Train Coming\" is a Christian album. It makes no apologies for this. Though far less preachy than its successor, \"Saved\", the theme of the album remains unmistakable. \"When He Returns\", the album's passionate closer, more than demonstrates this with lines such as \"He's got plans of his own to set up His throne when He returns\".\n\nWhether or not listeners accept this album most likely depends on their attitude towards the lyrics. Because there's nothing wrong with the music on \"Slow Train Coming\". \"Gotta Serve Somebody\" grooves in a way that Dylan had never really grooved previously. \"Precious Angel\" features Mark Knoplfer's distinctive guitar style and probably one of the best Dylan drawls ever recorded: \"Ya know I just couldn't make it by myself. I'm a little too blind to seeeEEEeeeeee.\" \"Slow Train\" contains an ominous groove. \"When you Gonna Wake Up\" lashes out at society's failings. Whether one agrees with the religious perspective or not, the criticism here seems valid and constructive. Only \"Man Gave Names To All The Animals\" sounds a little trite. Everything else on \"Slow Train Coming\" receives passion and conviction. Again, whether or not one agrees with the overall message, Dylan's performance is outstanding on this album (it even bagged him a Grammy for \"Best Rock Vocal\" - something his detractors, especially those who find his distinctive voice grating, must have cringed at).\n\n\"Slow Train Coming\" just adds proof to the argument that Bob Dylan remains one of the most provocative, controversial, and intruiguing artists of the 20th century. Apart from the music, he's given his fans plenty of challenges, and given future generations an almost insurmountable amount of material to ponder and debate about.","classification":4,"fold":0}
{"text":"Although k.d. lang came out of the Canadian country tradition, she broke the mold with her hit album \"Ingnue\" in 1992, and she's gone her own way ever since. She has a voice like no one else. The moment she begins to sing, a spell of impossibly romantic longing is cast. \"Sing It Loud,\" a new album of original ballads, all but two of them written or co-written by lang herself, is the epitome of her emotive style, the quintessence of desperate, delirious passion. It's an instant classic.\n\nk.d.'s debt to the heartbreaking ballads of Roy Orbison is evident on the first track, \"I Confess,\" with its insistent drums, lonely steel guitar, and wall-of-sound backing, but she puts her own stamp on it and on each of the songs that follow. \"A Sleep with No Dreaming\" and \"The Water's Edge\" are quieter and even more tender and plaintive, but the mood shifts on the fourth cut, \"Perfect Word.\" Suffused with a Muscle Shoals soulfulness, it's one of my favorite numbers on the disc. The lyrics are simple and direct, and a steel guitar solo suits it perfectly. lang can bring an edge to her voice that calls to mind Dusty Springfield, a tough tone that carries over to \"Sugar Buzz,\" in which she and her band really let loose.\n\nUp next is the title track, with banjo accompaniment that reminds us of k.d.'s country roots. The country sound is even more pronounced on \"Inglewood,\" introduced by an acoustic guitar and joined by piano and a gently wailing guitar. \"Habit of Mind\" is an anthem with a soaring chorus, a second fave of mine in which banjo and guitar again play important parts. The CD concludes with a fine cover of Talking Heads' \"Heaven\" and another superb anthem, \"Sorrow Nevermore.\"\n\nAvailable only at the kdlang website is a 14-track disc with four additional songs: \"Reminiscing,\" a Little River Band cover; \"I Am the Winner,\" an uptempo country song; \"Hollywood Kids,\" a country ballad; and \"Hungry Bird,\" a dreamy tune that's classic k.d. You can also watch numerous videos produced over the course of her career. The most recent are \"Inglewood,\" a lovely duet recorded in Australia, and \"I Confess,\" the first single from the new album, performed both in concert and as a wild music video. The latter, set at a \"gentlemen's club\" in Hollywood called Cheetah's, features lang's terrific band, The Siss Boom Bang, as well as a fire eater, a colorfully tattooed pole dancer, and a pair of libidinous lovers who end up wrestling in the suds at a self-serve car wash.

I simply don't get it. Mary has been selling millions of albums across the world for 16 years now and that could explain why, to these ears, she's beginning to sound a bit weary. She's been telling us all how she's incredibly happy now, how her life is exactly where she wants it to be and how, whilst going through all the pain in her recent past, one thing she's always strived to do is keep things real with her fans. This might all well be true but I'm yet to see Mary actually LOOKING happy in an interview or a video. (Jill Scott always looks happy for instance, even these days - and she's just been through a divorce!).\n\nBut maybe that's just Mary's way. Maybe it's the 'street' or 'ghetto fabulous' thing to; to never smile even if feeling blissful. Her continuous banging on about said bliss is starting to grate on the nerves a tad though. She's a strong woman, no doubt, and a trooper. She does \"keep on going\", as one reviewer said but at what cost? Like I said, the poor woman is probably just really tired.\n\nWhen she burst onto the scene back in 1992 with songs like \"Real Love\", \"Reminisce\" and \"Love No Limit\", she showed energy, versatility and raw emotion that have long since dissipated. The bittersweet \"Be Happy\" and the poignant \"I'm Goin' Down from her sophomore album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/My-Life\/dp\/B000002OU8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">My Life<\/a>&nbsp;proved she was no one-hit wonder. And let's not forget her star turns on hip-hop classics like \"Can't Knock The Hustle\" with Jay-Z (1996) and \"I'll Be There For You\/You're All I Need To Get By\" with Method Man (1995). I for one thought the title \"Queen of Hip-Hop Soul\" was absolutely well deserved.\n\nBut every subsequent album has been less satisfying, and more geared towards what was playing on the radio than the one that preceded it. By the time \"The Breakthrough\" came out, I was starting to lose interest. It was clear to any objective listener that Mary was just treading water and I've barely played the CD three times since I got it. This one I simply couldn't bear and had to take right back to the store and ask for something else.\n\nAs soon as I saw the video to her single \"Just Fine\", I had my doubts. The Michael Jackson homage-paying intro (and the video itself) was probably well intentioned but to me, they just fell flat. It just doesn't sound or look like she really means it. She's singing about being uplifted but she sounds (and looks) anything but. Jackson looked ecstatic in the video to \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" but to me, Mary looks like she'd rather be somewhere else, doing something else. It's not so much in her moves, it's in her eyes and her facial expressions.\n\nThe female empowerment of \"Grown Woman\" and \"Feel Like A Woman\" sound like the kind of thing that would play well to Oprah's studio audience but this listener just couldn't find the groove - and I'm no chauvinist. It would take too long to list the female empowerment tunes I've grooved to in my time.\n\nPharrell's multi-tempoed \"'Til The Morning\" and Ne-Yo's interestingly winding \"Smoke\" are probably the only two songs on here that break away from the made-for-radio formula that dominates the album and Mary is probably singing the best she's ever sung - much more control, much less excess - but somehow for me, that just makes her less interesting to listen to. A perfect example of what I mean is the solemn \"Fade Away\". Forget all the almost spiritual wailing and chest beating of the good old days, Mary sounds like she's barely breaking a sweat.\n\nMaybe that's how music is now in the 21st century and I need to either get with the program or leave it alone. Or maybe, just maybe, as listeners, we've allowed our standards to drop to basement level and as a result, anything even slightly passable is lauded as the next best thing. Mary is undoubtedly one of the legends of our time and I'll never even try to take that away from her but I do wonder if the way many of us fans are almost deifying the woman these days, is blinding us to the fact that her music is simply not as good as it used to be. I realise that we're living in an age where creativity and individuality are not rewarded and where studio executives and radio programmers are now telling artistes what kind of music to make so it's entirely possible that Mary's heart isn't really in the music she's putting out, despite all her talk of the contrary. Whatever. In the end, we'll only get the quality of music that we as consumers demand.\n\nMaybe Mary's new life is indeed the happy and peaceful one she says it is. All I know is that while it must be a good thing (especially for her) that all the pain is behind her and all the angst gone, her supposedly newly-found joy is not coming through in the music quite yet. To me, singing songs of empowerment and bliss while looking and sounding utterly miserable just makes Mary painful to watch - and to listen to.\n\nThe album will probably still sell truckloads and earn her all kinds of awards, so I know my view is the minority one. I also know that my review is very likely to be unpopular here but I had to say my piece. I didn't want to post the review but a good Amazon buddy of mine (who will remain nameless) encouraged me to do so, so here it is. Let the hissing, booing and clicking on the \"no\" button begin.","classification":3,"fold":0}

But it's only half good, thanks to poor song selection and mostly ho-hum arrangements.  With all the great anti-war and social consciousness songs available from the 60s and 70s, they picked a weak crop.  \"Compared to What\" is a of a classic choice, but this arrangement doesn't compare to the rave-up Les McCann\/Eddie Harris version on the Montreux live album.  It's just ok.  \"Wake Up Everybody\" is another classic song and at least in this case the album delivers a worthwhile remake, thanks to the vocals of Melanie Fiona and the inclusion of a rap break.  But otherwise, I'm just not that impressed.  The low point comes when people in the car beg me to turn off the screaming repetition of \"They shot me in the shoulder!\" from \"I Can't Write Left Handed\" and I'm happy to oblige because I can't stand it either.  I had an inkling I wouldn't like this album when I heard it was being promoted through Starbucks.  By and large I haven't liked the company's taste in music.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Earth Wind and Fire is one of the greatest R&B groups which scored a number of great hits during mid 70s to early 80s. It has released a number of greatest hit compilations so far, but this one is most suited for ordinary music fans who have never bought any of EW&F albums.\n\nEarth Wind and Fire is regarded as a disco hit maker because during late 70s to early 80s the group had produced such tracks that might fit well for disco-dancing from slow ballad AFTER THE LOVE HAS GONE to dance-pop BOOGIE WONDERLAND and LET'S GROOVE. But up until mid 70s they created some great spiritual songs with ethreal out-of-the-world chorus. CAN'T HIDE LOVE is one of the good examples to show their chorus style. FANTASY is by far the most successful single release in Japan. KALIMBA STORY and MIGHTY MIGHTY are the funky pop songs representing their early days' music style.\n\nVerdict: Well-balanced and great one-CD compilation showcasing their career.\nRating: 90 out of 100\nRecommended for: Music fans who want to get a glimpse of great 70s music.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"It is a story that is all too familiar to those who have studied the early history of rock and roll. Greedy record label owners and executives would conspire to cheat artists out of the royalties they were entitled to. Not surprisingly during this period many black artists were victimized by this practice at labels like Herman Lubinsky's Savoy records in New Jersey and Syd Nathan's King records in Cincinnati. In the late 1950's, Berry Gordy Jr. had been bouncing around the record business trying to find his niche. Although he had written a couple of hits for Jackie Wilson Gordy quickly discovered that songwriting was really not all that lucrative. Berry Gordy Jr. had much bigger ambitions. He looked at the musical landscape in America and determined that there was a boatload of money to be made marketing black music to affluent white teenagers. And so with several hundred dollars of borrowed money Gordy founded Motown Records in Detroit. The year was 1960. He dubbed his modest recording studios in an old house in the Detroit suburbs \"Hitsville, USA\". Now there was a ton of talent in Detroit in those days and Berry Gordy was very adroit at recognizing it and getting these artists to sign with Motown.\n\nOne of the first acts signed by Berry Gordy Jr. was an R&B group from Detroit that called themselves The Miracles. Led by the gifted song writer and dynamic vocalist Smokey Robinson The Miracles would become one of Motown's most consistent hit makers. In December 1960 Motown released \"Shop Around\" on it's Tamla label. The song was an immediate success spending 16 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #2. It was also the label's first #1 hit on the R&B chart. This is the original hit single you would remember from the radio.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"The Waterfall didn't really grab me on first listen, much like every My Morning Jacket album since Z. Honestly, after the first time through The Waterfall, I was ready to give up and declare it the worst MMJ album yet. As a huge fan since I first heard At Dawn almost 15 years ago, the vibe on The Waterfall felt too far removed from what MMJ can do.\n\nFortunately, I decided to come back to this album rather than writing it off, and Im definitely glad I did. This is an ambitious and bold album that shows a band still progressing and trying new things after two decades. Sure, MMJ could release more alt country stuff that everyone would love, but this is a band that wants to grow. And they're definitely growing here on The Waterfall.\n\nThere seem to be many reviewers and fans out there who still want to refer to MMJ as an alt country band, but lets be honest: they haven't alt country since Z. They aren't going back (although there are always reminders embedded in the music), and The Waterfall is another step forward, not a step in the wrong direction.\n\nAt times, the album feels too ambitious (but not in the same way as songs like Highly Superstitious). For example, the chorus of opening track \"Believe\" feels a bit cheesy coming from Jim James. But, on the whole, this album works quite well. The guitar work is incredible throughout, especially on songs like Tropics. In Its Infancy (The Waterfall) is one of the catchiest and most epic MMJ songs to date. And the singing continues to show off Jamess impressive range and influence.\n\nIts not my favorite MMJ album at this moment in time. Not by a longshot. But its a grower, and it is slowly moving up the ranks.\n\nThe Waterfall as a whole might not immediately grab all MMJ fans (although quite a few people seem to be saying it's their favorite MMJ release already). Like I said, it took a few listens for me to really appreciate it. But once it finally clicked, I realized this was a fantastic piece of art from a band that delivers again and again.","classification":5,"fold":0}

The title track is outstanding and will leave you playing it over and over and over but all of the other songs are just as pulsating and ear-wormy!

There isn't one song that you'll want to skip over; you may think so but after the second listen, they ALL will become your favorites.  I love The Original High so much and I can't get enough of the beat, the rhythm, tempo and Adam Lambert's unparalleled vocal prowess.

{"text":"THE BAND: Brandon Flowers (vocals, synthesizer, piano, bass), Dave Keuning (guitar), Mark Stoermer (bass), Ronnie Vannucci (drums & percussion). Hailing from Las Vegas, NV.\n\nTHE DISC: (2006) 12 tracks clocking in at just over 44 minutes. Included with the disc is a 14-page booklet containing song titles\/credits\/times (no lyrics), band pictures, and thank you's. This is album #2. Recorded at Studio At The Palms (Las Vegas). Label - Island Records.\n\nCOMMENTS: I wanted to love \"Sam's Town\" (named after a 9-story Vegas hotel and casino built in 1979). The Killers' 1st album, \"Hot Fuss\" (2004), was such an incredible album... I ran out and bought \"Sam's Town\" based on the strength of their debut. \"Hot Fuss\" had hit after catchy hit and garnered the band tons of accolades - most notably an American Music Award, a Billboard Music Award and a Grammy nomination. While \"Sam's Town\" has grown on me, it still lacks that, um...  punch. I would be surprised if this album won any of the above mentioned awards. There's no brilliant songs like \"Mr. Brightside\", \"Somebody Told Me\" or \"Smile Like You Mean It\" here. No need to compare their 1st and 2nd albums... they're vastly different. Having waited to fully digest this disc, I've come away with the feeling that this is more like a swashbuckling theatrical soundtrack than a rock\/alternative album... something Freddy Mercury (R.I.P.) would have really appreciated. It's up, it's down, happy, sad, rock, pop and downright weird (just like some of the classic Queen albums). \"Sam's Town\" has several good tracks on it... \"When You Were Young\" (hit #18 on the pop charts, but fell quickly after 2 weeks), \"Bones\" (their next hit), and \"Read My Mind\". There's also some nice piano and acoustic moments on the \"enterlude\" and \"exitlude\". The rest is downright average, with some songs being utterly forgettable. I've read reviews here on Amazon as well as some of the well-known music mags and \"Sam's Town\" is a mixed bag at best (and I agree)... Rolling Stone Magazine (2 stars out of 5), All Music Guide (3 stars out of 5), Blender (4 out of 5), and Spin (3 out of 5). Billboard shows the unit sales dropping from week 1 (315,000 units) to week 2 (102,000 units) to week 3 (62,000 units)... a steady decline can't be a good thing. By the way, is that Ruth Buzzi's kid on the cover? A decent album I suppose - just expecting so much more (3 stars).","classification":3,"fold":0}

For Fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern R&B voice and sound in her music, it actually hasn't actually drove the point home. Her song Without Me, with Kelly Roland and Missy Elliot, the second single from her album Side Effects Of You is honestly one of the worst choices she has made into song. I really found it to be much weaker in the song from Fantasia, while it is more of a song that would fit into Kelly Rowland's sound, or something that Ciara would make. I definitely was not that impressed with the song, and it definitely is Fantasia's low point.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":0}

{"text":"This is a conceptually brilliant stylistic blending of Frazey Ford's Canadian singer-songwriter\/folk-country excellence and the magnificent Memphis soul of Hi Records in the 1970s (the most consistent soul label of that decade -- think Al Green and especially Ann Peebles [\"I Can't Stand the Rain\"]) under the artistic direction of producer Willie Mitchell.  The participation in this project of the Hi Rhythm Section, including the late electric-guitar great Mabon \"Teenie\" Hodges (to whom this album is dedicated), keyboardist\/organist Reverend Charles Hodges, Sr., bass guitarist Leroy Hodges (this was a family affair!), along with drummers James E. Robertson Sr. and co-producer (with Frazey Ford) John Raham, propels it over the top with this signature Willie Mitchell\/Hi Records sound.  And I need also mention the splendid punctuation provided by the Memphis-soul-style horns, originally an innovation in Southern soul music of the Memphis Stax label in the sixties. Stunning arrangements, top-notch organic production methods abound here; and the sound engineering, mixing and mastering are impeccable.\n\nAll ten songs are originals, nine of which were written or co-written by Frazey Ford; and while there is nary a weak one, my three personal favorites would have to include the definitively defiant \"Done\" (the putdowns are positively Dylanesque, recalling \"Positively 4th Street\"), the bouncy and lyrical opener \"September Fields\" (after the intro I was almost expecting to hear the voice of Ann Peebles emerging!), and the intriguing, seemingly Otis Redding-inspired \"Weather Pattern,\" featuring the Reverend Hodges's churchiest organ-playing as well as the album's most striking horn arrangement.  Make that four favorites, as I just listened to \"You're Not Free\" again.  This one sounds like one of those gorgeously languid Al Green ballads that would grace his '70s LPs but not appear on his singles.  These are all beautifully delivered by Frazey Ford in her unique, enticing, melismatic style.  It's accurate to say that some of the lyrical content is less than completely comprehensible upon one's initial listen due to her quirky vibrato-wrapped phrasing; however, it becomes much more easily decipherable each successive time until you get on her precise wavelength.  I find her vocal style refreshing and soulfully expressive, never more so than in the context of the stellar music contained herein.  In any event, this is not anywhere near the problem it is with 90% of the critically acclaimed rock and folk-rock that is out there now -- and printed lyrics may soon be provided on her website.  Hey, this is not a Mel Torm or Rosemary Clooney LP, nor is it meant to be an elocution lesson.  This is Canadian\/Southern soul and it sounds fantastic!  If she puts out another album in this exact style (although sadly it will have to be without Teenie Hodges), in the title words of the old Jackson 5 hit: \"I'll be there.\"","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I was absolutely delighted to find this set of the Beethoven piano sonatas performed by the great Hungarian pianist Jeno Jando for sale for such an amazing price -- even less than the blowout price seen earlier this year on iTunes for the much-discussed HJ Lim set.\n\nJando is one of the finest concert pianists around in my view, although his star seems frequently eclipsed by bigger, splashier names. This is the full set of Beethoven piano sonatas he recorded for Naxos in the late 1980s. The sound is very good overall, but these recordings were made in Budapest in the final years before the fall of the communist regime there, and occasionally one can notice that the recording technology, though good, was not state of the art. The dynamics seem a little flat sometimes, and there are occasional mild noise issues. One also wonders what kind of piano he was playing and whether that contributed to the slightly flat sound.\n\nNo matter -- Jando's consummate musicianship shines through in outstanding performances. His readings are sensitive and powerful without being pretentious or idiosyncratic. At least, not too idiosyncratic -- he does hum along on occasion, a la Glenn Gould but much more quietly. Also, the use of the sustain pedal is mostly reserved, resulting in a more clipped, harpsichord- or fortepiano-like feeling than on many recordings. This does not bother me in the least, but don't expect these performances as a whole to be dripping with lingering Romanticism.\n\nBitrates are variable and range from 185 kbps to 219 kbps on average. Total download size is 890 MB for just over 10 hours of great music.\n\nDespite some minor imperfections, I can't recommend this bargain set highly enough. Anyone familiar with Jando will want to snatch it up, and anyone who's not should certainly check these recordings out.","classification":5,"fold":0}

But nevertheless, when she was a part of Destiny's Child, she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart. Her solo debut song Crazy In Love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work, and the beginning of her relationship with her husband Jay-Z. They have had other collaborations for her career like the wasted Deja Vu, and the recent Drunk In Love which sounded more like a waste of time in voice and heart, and Bonnie & Clyde '03.

In fact, somebody tried too hard to make this song a hit, which never really caught on, but you hear it on radio constantly, to the point where you cringe every time you hear this song.\n\nAnd by the way, does anybody else think that an inspirational song from somebody like Avril Lavigne, who is not the best of role models, is just plain wrong? In either case, the song doesn't work, except on a lyrical level, and even that's been done before.","classification":1,"fold":0}

{"text":"When it has came down to what David Bowie had made in his music for generations, he really let his music speak for itself, and his soul had shown to be everlasting. Yet, while David did pass away from liver cancer in 2016, his soul and the heart of his music has still been recognized as one of the most innovative catalogs of talent to the world. His heart was in each and every song he had done, by changing looks, changing appeal, but being a smart and assertive human being. He really let the songs and the music speak for itself, and David had a huge impact by bring art rock into light for each and every album. When he released The Next Day, after a near decade long absence, he really had a lot to say, ever when his music wasn't on radio anymore. Where Are We Now?, the lead single from The Next Day is honestly one of those that sincerely brought his heart to the soul, and a sign that David matured, but his music hadn't changed at all. If you had never heard a David Bowie song, or if you're only discovering him from the impact of his death, than I sincerely recommend this song a lot.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"For You by Staind really hit home for me musically speaking because it talks about the difficulties that can arise in relationships with certain people who play important roles in ones life for better or for the challenging. The singer eloquently expresses how a persons words can greatly hurt based on how much they meant to you. I can relate to this song all too well due to my reluctant acceptance to come to terms with being the black sheep\/oddball of my family (I only finally accepted being the family black sheep a month ago instead of perpetually fighting against it). Fortunately, some family members do accept me, however I now embrace that others may never get me or like me regardless of what I do or say (such as my adoptive father). However, instead of feeling sorry for myself, I take it as a positive lesson why I must continue to live independently and reside in the location I feel is best for my husband and I (regardless of what both family members and strangers to me may say). For You by Staind brilliantly professes the heavy emotion that one can feel around the heavy task of not letting frequent and continual verbal attacks and\/or social exclusion penetrate ones emotional\/psychological armor. For You by Staind is also a meaningful rock song.","classification":5,"fold":0}

The song features the classic line \"My love is in league with the freeway\" which would be enough to justify its existence alone. The music is laid back, guitar biased and compelling. Theguitar line draws you into the song and Plant's voice works well and conveys the sense of longing for a lost love which is at the heart of the lyrics.

{"text":"I was introduced to this song via the a capella group Pentatonix, who covered this song for a Christmas album.  I thought it was a pretty song with a soothing tune... until I paid closer attention to the lyrics and was shocked at what I heard.  How was THIS a Christmas song?  Befuddled but intrigued, I looked up the original song on YouTube and hunted around for some sort of explanation as to what the lyrics could mean.  I was unable to find an official interpretation of the lyrics and fan interpretations are all over the place, but in the end I liked the song well enough to download it for myself.\n\nI'm not sure I'd classify this song as a Christmas song, despite the mentions of snow and winter clothing.  But it's a lovely folk rock number with some startling lyrics, and guaranteed to make you think.\n\nFleet Foxes has a sound reminiscent of '70s folk rock singers like John Denver, and their voices are pleasant and calming to listen to, harmonizing well together.  The instrumentation fits the song well, and is fairly moderate in pace -- not fast and upbeat but not terribly slow either.  The song itself is a single repeated stanza, with an instrumental bridge and a semi-chanting opening that draws the listener in.  The entire song has a wistful, almost melancholy feel to it, quite at odds with the macabre subject matter.\n\nIt seems the lyrics were chosen to be more poetic than straightforward, and are both puzzling and rather shocking.  There's a line about people wearing scarves to \"keep their little heads from falling in the snow\" (the line that made me go \"...wait, what?\" when I heard the song again) as well as someone falling and turning \"the white snow red as strawberries in the summertime.\"  Rather morbid for what's being promoted as a Christmas song... though the song never explicitly mentions Christmas or anything else seasonal besides snow, so this is more a fault of the people promoting it, I think.\n\nI've heard several interpretations of the lyrics to \"White Winter Hymnal\" -- that it's an allegory for the French Revolution, that it's about the passing of the seasons, that it's telling the story of the death of the narrator's friend, etc.  And no, the music video is no help in deciphering a meaning, as it has little to nothing to do with the song's lyrics.  I find, however, that not understanding what the song means doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the song.  Some of my favorite songs are those whose meaning aren't evident at first glance, such as Don McLean's \"American Pie\" or the Eagles' \"Hotel California,\" and \"White Winter Hymnal\" isn't much different.\n\nDefinitely NOT a Christmas song, despite what Amazon, the Pentatonix, or anyone else might say, this is still a lovely and fascinating song, and well worth adding to your music collection.  In a world where so many songs have become banal and nearly identical in subject matter, it's nice to see something original and truly creative.","classification":5,"fold":0}
{"text":"OK I ws ready for a big let down after hering We Will Never Get Back Together (which is really bad) - but that is the worst song here (except 22 which is also bad) but the rest of what's here is really terrific especailly State Of Grace, Red, All Too Well, I Almost Do, Stay Stay Stay, The Last Time, Holy Ground, Sad Beautiful Tragic, The Lucky One, Everything Has Changed, Starlight and Begin Again.  Stay Stay Stay, Holy Ground, and The Lukcy One are among her best.  In fact the second half of the album is much better than the first half when she write the soings by herself and does not work with co-writers.  Highly recommended!  Here's how I rank the songs -- 10 - awesome to 1 - terrible\n\n  1. State Of Grace - 9\n  2. Red - 8\n  3. Treacherous - 7\n  4. I Knew You Were Trouble - 7\n  5. All Too Well - 9\n  6. 22 - 6\n  7.

{"text":"Had no idea this even existed, but not surprised.  Once in a while, Walmart has exclusives, but they are not advertised, we don't get their fliers in the paper around here.  If they do have exclusives, with bonus tracks and such, they are usually on mainstream artists (like Bon Jovi, 1 bonus track on their latest album & in a jewelcase) and country people like Blake...on his last album, \"Bringing Back The Sunshine\", Walmart had 3 bonus tracks on it...soooo, before I bought this collection, it was $9.99 at Target, I wanted to stop in to Walmart, and I had to anyway to buy my minutes on my phone...Straight Talk, Walmart only or over the phone...I went over to the CDs and lo & behold, this boxset!!  Snatched it right up, and I'm sure Blake approved because it's like a drinking party in a box.  You have an expanded & bigger-sized 24 page booklet, with all the single sleeve pictures and dates they each hit #1 on the country airplay chart, 2 Blake can holders (pretty cool), 2-sided coasters with all of Blake's album covers, from his self-titled debut up through \"Reloaded\".  One thing I noticed was the original \"Loaded\" CD cover was missing from the coasters...I guess it doesn't count anymore.\n\nLastly, the CD itself is not in a jewelcase, but part of a clear plastic ribbon-liftable snap tray separating the booklet from the coasters and can holders, and also, the tracklisting is in chronological order, starting with \"Austin\" and ending with \"Gonna\", not random like the standard CD...I prefer it to be chronological as well, so I'm happy, the collection flows very well this way. as an actual album, not disjointed.  Looking forward to his next album, which he's currently writing tunes for, and I get a kick out of the ol' lug on the Voice...dude is hilarious...","classification":5,"fold":0}

I bought this in the late seventies when I was hoping that he might enjoy a return to form. No such luck.\n\nThe instrumental \"Song For Guy\" is the highlight and is the sole representation for this album on Elton's 4CD box set. \"Part Time Love\" was a pleasant enough single for the radio stations that secretaries put on to get them through the workday. Of the rest, only \"Shooting Star\" might be of note.\n\nThere are thousands of great albums waiting to be discovered out there. Unless someone is determined to consume every album issued by Elton John, \"A Single Man\" is better left to history.

{"text":"After the breakup of The Beatles each member would of course go on to form their own solo career. John, Paul and George would certainly go on to have hits songs and chart toppers but it always seemed to me that Ringo was over looked a bit in what he accomplished in the years after going out on his own. Yeah he maybe didn't have as big an impact as his former bandmates on the charts but that doesn't mean he wasn't putting out some great music. He most definitely was. The album \"Photograph: The Very Best Of Ringo\" (a greatest hit compilation) is good proof of that. His music maybe didn't have the depth and social message to it as the other former lads were but Ringo's music I always thought was great good times, party kind of music sure to please and entertain anyone looking for some uplifting music.\n\nMy favorite Ringo song of all time one of his earliest hits, \"It Don't Come Easy\". Not necessarily one of his \"party\" songs but with a good beat, strong lyrics and Ringo in fine voice makes for an enjoyable piece of music. If you could only download one song by Ringo from his solo career you wouldn't go wrong adding this to your MP3 player.","classification":5,"fold":0}
{"text":"Husker Du hit the jackpot with their excellent, ambitious 1984 album Zen Arcade. New Day Rising continues to balance their hardcore energy and noise rock with apparenet melodic tendencies. The songs are as aggressive as they were the last time, but a on several occasions there are given more room to melodies than with Zen Arcade, especially on songs like \"Celebrated Summer\", which is miles away from their original hardcore fury. New Day Rising is also more accessible to Zen Arcade, so this might not be a bad record for one to start with, at least if one is not for their later, less energetic and more \"soppy\" material.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Right now this is one of my two favorite new cd's.  The other being In Flames \"A sense of Purpose.\"I'd say with a little more time this album could have been that much better, but like all Sevendust albums it's still quite good.  They throw in quite a bit of variety which I love.  There are also more guitar solos than any other Sevendust album, as far as I remember.  On a scale of of 1-10 I'd give this a solid 7 maybe 8.  I'm enjoying this one more and more every time I hear it.\n\nInside - this one has an intro that goes on a little too long for my taste, but when the song gets going it's one of my favorites on the album.  It's a kind of alpha-esque song with a solid riff and good drum beat.  Probably the heaviest song on the album.  I wish they had expanded on the bridge a little and maybe put an instrumental break, but still it's a great song.  9\/10\n\nEnough - This one's a decent enough rocker.  I don't have a whole lot to say about it except that it's an enjoyable song.  7\/10\n\nHope - This is probably my favorite song, either this or inside.  Musically I think it's the most diverse on the album.  I like the main riff and the solo.  The stringed instruments during the solo were cool as well.  10\/10\n\nScapegoat - This one has kind of quieter verses with some electronics and a heavy very catchy chorus.  Some of the lyrics in this one for me are a bit... but I'm a sucker for a catchy chorus and it is still a good song.  8\/10\n\nFear - Another good song.  This one like Enough I don't have a whole lot to talk about.  It's kind of a mid-tempo rocker with some cool musical pieces thrown in  7\/10\n\nThe Past - My least favorite song on the album, not because of the writting.  The song is well written.  It's an acoustic song.  I just can't get into Daughtry's voice.  It reminds me too much of the guy from Shinedown.  Still it's not a bad song and right now I'm not minding hearing it.  6\/10\n\nProdigal Son - A mid-tempo rocker that I really like.  There's just something about the vocals in this one that I really like.  Something about them just sound different from what Lajon has done in the past, but I can't put my finger on it.  There's also a short, but decent solo.  8\/10\n\nLifeless - This one's a little faster than a mid-tempos song.  It's a rocker with a quieter chorus.  There's also another decent guitar solo.  I hope they keep using solos from now on.  8\/10\n\nSorrow - This one's another slower one with the lead singer from Alter Bridge.  Yesterday at work I had this one going through my head.  I like the main riff.  They use a cool effect, I think it's either a chorus or flange, but it's been a long time since I've played with guitar effects so I can't remember.  Kennedy's voice sounds different than I remember on any Alter bridge album.  I hope for their next one he uses this style for a song or two.  8\/10\n\nContradiction - This is another of my favorites.  This is another rocker.  I like the chorus it's kind of different from a typical Sevendust chorus.  9\/10\n\nWalk Away - This is another solid track and a good album closer.  There's more screaming in this one than any other song except maybe for Inside.  9\/10\n\nI'd review the bonus tracks as well, but I don't feel like it.  I'll just say that they're pretty solid as well.  You've got Lucky One and Disgust which are heavier and Heart in your hands which is slower.  Still they're enjoyable.\n\nThis may not be my favorite Sevendust Album, but it's certainly not a bad one.\n\nI think most Sevendust fans will find this one a good addition to their collection.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"There are sometimes cover songs that really sound much better than the original version other artists have recorded. But that honestly has been said very, very few times in the world. That definitively has been with said with Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You, Rod Stewart's rendition of Tom Waits classic Downtown Train, and Joe Cocker's cover of The Beatles classic With A Little Help From My Friends. But that also can be said about Simply Red. They have had some cover songs that really have been enjoyable from the cover of The Stylistics classic You Make Me Feel Brand New, but their definitive staple is the Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes classic If You Don't Know Me By Now, which is one of the most guiltiest pleasure songs I have ever enjoyed. The song really is the catalyst of their success in America since the 1980's and beyond. It is one off those romantic songs that has been sincerely timeless. I have never stopped getting tired of the Mick Hucknall & company ballad, and if you had never heard a Simply Red song, than this is the standard to download.\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Steve Vai is one of the most amazing guitar players and composers of all time and The Story Of Light is his new album that unleashes his intense skills for our musical enjoyment. Like most albums from Steve Vai, The Story Of Light is an artwork from a musician aiming to achieve the best he is capable of both in creativity and performance. Steve Vai surrounds himself with awesome musicians that bring life to his musical creations rather than trying to take the glory all himself. On this album he has got amazing drumming from Jeremy Colson who also nailed the previous Steve Vai album, groove master and technician Philip Bynoe on bass, and long time collaborator Dave Weiner also helping on guitar. The performances are stunning, the sound and production is huge, but most importantly the music is unique and although it hits you immediately there are lots of layers to discover with repeat listening. Picking highlights is pointless in an album of this quality so all I can say is listen to this album if you are a fan of guitar virtuosity that focuses on creating memorable music. Steve Vai you are going to be remembered for what you have achieved in this life...","classification":5,"fold":0}

But honestly, it takes a certain magic to absolutely ignite it from the heart, and make it all worth the effort, the patience, and the heart. For Elton John, he has honestly withstood the test of time in his music and with Bernie Taupin's lyrics, their songs have honestly been the greatest second-coming after The Beatles, with heart, voice, head and heart from time. For George Michael, he has done several of Elton and Bernie's songs live for years, from Tonight for the Two Rooms album in 1991, to Idol off of his Symphonica live album, but out of all of them, the most significant that still delivers all of this time is Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me, which was done as a charity singer in regards to AIDS, which both of them suffered a magnificent loss with Freddie Mercury of Queen, losing his life in 1991. The duet still ignites from the heart, much better than all the joke duets recorded over the past few decades. If you have loved both Elton John and George Michael for years, than you'll absolutely love this song.\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I'm so glad that Jack Bruce and Cream recorded \"I'm So Glad\". In the late 60's and into the early 70's this went from being one of the first songs we wanted to play to a popular cover song in our playlist. Each of us were captured during those youthful times by the energy of Jack Bruce's driving bass and vocals. Clapton's guitar and the Baker's rhythmic inspirations completed the sonic picture.\n\nThe bottom line is after listening to or playing \"I'm So Glad\" we did feel more glad. Jack Bruce was very present and driving in all of Cream's music, but this is one of those where his bass and vocal talent shine through more brightly.\n\nI've been a fan of Jack Bruce since those days with Cream in the 60's. \"I'm So Glad\" is the song that really brought him to my attention for the first time. A true classic and 5 stars to me.","classification":5,"fold":0}
{"text":"It honestly is surprising that someone whom has a lot of talent has lost it with having her voice, and that is very rare that someone can have that happen. Unfortunately, for Meghan Trainor, I have not been pleased with the set of songs she had came out with on her second album, Thank You. When I first heard the song No, I was not only not pleased, I found it to be a weak gamble for her to follow into Britney Spears territory with her voice. Somberly, with a lot of the tracks I had heard from her Thank You album, like I Love Me, I felt she was losing her voice at the soul. Her latest single, Me Too, the third from her Thank You album definitely is not a strong suit for her. She does bring some of her voice back she had on her past songs like Dear Future Husband, but overall, I still was not impressed overall with the work and I think Meghan does need to find better than what she made out with Thank You. Perhaps when her third record comes out, she can have more from her own voice to flow than met the eye, and heard from the soul.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"For those not familiar with Danny Seraphine, he was a founding member and the original drummer for the legendary band Chicago from 1967 through 1990.  He is also considered one of the great stylists and innovators on his instrument, forging a unique jazz-based rock style that propelled his supergroup through 20 top ten hits, 16 million-selling albums and numerous sold out concerts around the world for millions of fans. After Danny was \"fired\" by the group in 1990, he went into seclusion and put his drums aside.  Following years of production projects in the sudio and even Broadway, Danny got back into form in recent years with the inspiration of top industry musicians.  His jam sessions resulted in the formation of \"CTA\" and now the release of this studio work with a wonderful mix of Chicago classics and originals and other rock standards.  Bottomline: Every track works and every track cooks.  Danny's drum chops are back intact as he leads this band of top flight musicians with the amazing Marc Bonilla on guitar and Tower of Power's incredible Larry Braggs on vocals.  Yes, Danny Seraphine is back, back with a vengeance and showing the world a return to the original musical inspiration that made the early Chicago great.  While his former bandmates earn a paycheck entertaining the wine and cheese crowd with Peter Cetra covers like \"If You leave Me Now\" Danny and CTA are playing real music for the sake of the music itself and blowin' the door down.\n\"California Transit Authority\" is a superb CD and is a must listen for all Chicago fans and fans of rock music in general. The current members of Chicago could also stand to listen to this exciting work as a reminder of what they set out to accomplish musically in 1967, while using \"Chicago XXX\" as a coaster for their drinks.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Saw Ted\/Trucks band on ACL and liked them so WishListed \"Let Me Get By\".\n\nFirst the music...\n\nWhile generally classified as Blues-Rock or Blues, I hear a country-rock flavor in many tracks. Not surprising given Trucks' Allman Brothers roots, but I hear more of it in Susan's voice on some tracks. Best example is track 1, \"Anyhow\". While I'm not a \"country fan\", I'm not adverse to a little country flavor... just not into a steady diet of it. And Flavor is all that is here... and only on some tracks adding to the variety and there is nothing if not variety in this 2 disc set.\n\nOther tracks are pure blues including some where Susan's voice is reminiscent of Bonnie Raitt. Track 2, \"Laugh About It\", is an early example. I love Bonnie, but if I heard her in every vocal, then I'd be critical. I didn't, so I'm not.\n\nAnd then there are tracks that come out of nowhere... juke joint material... rock... just wonderfully varied listening.\n\nNow onto the SQ (Sound Quality). When I saw TTB on ACL there must have been eight or ten players on stage. Guitars, horns, keyboards, string, drums x 2 and backing vocalists. And they all seem to be there on this CD, but when they all play I have issues telling and that's the rub. On the three or four busiest tracks the supporting cast all seem to fall into a mush of sound even sometimes dragging the backup vocals with them. Susan's vocals always rise above as does Derek's guitar work, but there's mired sound below them.\n\nSimpler tracks, like the stripped down \"Swamp Raga...\", are beautifully done, as are those where backing instruments tend to take turns, making the confusion of the bogged down tracks all the more mysterious.

{"text":"With just about every movie where there's a love interest, there's a love song.\nWell when \"Batman Forever\" was released, my three sons raved about this song. With the franchise changing Batmans like the four seasons, my sons like most kids were into it (so was their mother).\nSeal's range of vocal talent is very versatile on this one. He sings sweetly & calm, then gradually crescendos to his full range of expression.\nI love the Circus sound @the intro, to a guitar solo with violins soaring & swelling to the choral part.\nI believe there is a sound of a harpsicord, electronic or not, lovely.\nHis lyric of \"compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey\" brings it home for me.\nThe bridge of the song is testament to that. A beautiful tribute to any woman who listens to it, with a British seaside imagined by only the way Seal can give it to us. Makes me feel as though I myself has bloomed.","classification":5,"fold":0}

Mercury. 2010.  2 CDs.  $13.99.\nJJ, voc, guit; others.\n\nLOVETT, Lyle. Live in Texas. MCA. 1999.  $10.49.\n\nCountry Western music is a bit like the little girl who \"had a little curl right in he middle of her forehead\/And when she as good, she was very very good\/ And when she was bad, she was horrid.\" Two of these albums -the last album by C&W great Waylon Jennings and the double album by Alabaman Jamey Johnson, are, if not horrid, at least very very disappointing. But then there's the live album by Lyle Lovett, which, like most of his albums, is well thought out, balanced, musical and alive.\n\nThe virtues of Waylon Jennings as a Country Western singer are many but they've always been balanced by his defects: on the plus side, his take charge manner, his swagger, and that deep resonant voice of his which can, when he's on, tells stories and communicate emotion with the best of him. Waylon at his best is like Johnny Cash on steroids and that's a good thing.\n\nUnfortunately, this album is not his best. To start with, there's not a standout song on the album. Waylon has sold many mediocre songs in the past solely on the strength of his masculine energy and voice. But he sounds tired here. He needed better songs at this point in his career, so his storytelling qualities could take over, but these songs don't provide it.  (2-1\/2 * out of 5)\n\nI was looking forward to hearing Johnson. I'd not heard him before and what I read about him made it sound like he'd be an interesting performer. He's not. His voice is adequate, pretty much generic western male vocalist, outlaw variety. The songs, many of which he wrote, are by and large mediocre. There are 25 songs on this two-disc album. Two of them grabbed me, the first one on each side. \"Lonely at the Top,\" written by Cook .Whitley and Raines, falls into a groove and the lyrics aren't the more usual (on this album) groan and moan resentment lyrics. \"By the Seat of Your Pants\" is a lesson from Papa story about how you learn Life as you go. But the rest of the songs sound generic and many of them are lugubrious, and the quality of Johnson's low moaning voice doesn't help things at all. Two hours of this music was enough to make me want to go to sleep. (2* out of 5)\n\nThe live Lyle album is Lyle with his Little Big Band. It's not his best album -his very first album is that--but it's awfully good. What a great ensemble he had assembled! Listen to the backup singers on \"Church\", for instance. There are a number of favorites on the album, including his best song ever, \"Closing Time,\" a tune I have used on CD mix after CD mix. The thing about Lovett is his range: he sings ballads as well as he odes blues, and he kicks with the best of the C&W crew. And the lyrics! They're witty, even funny. How many other Country Western giants can you say that about? (4* out of 5)","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"It often seems that soul,in the context of a genre of music,refers mainly to a type of singing and playing. Actually you can have the right singing,the right playing and somehow it just isn't quite soul. It's very much a literal term. Very much an individual conception. Bettye LaVette here has a new book out,and one knows she has a lot of stories to tell. But I know two things for sure: her recording career was stalled for decades,and he has a reputation for being a headstrong personality with an enormous sense of conviction in the tradition of all the greats in the genre. This album,celebrating her half century in the \"biz\" is musically dedicated to all the music that inspired her along the way.\n\n  For starters,this album is extraordinarily funkified. In a very deep southern way too-filled with heavily revered drums,electric guitar,bass and keyboards. Dylan's \"Everything Is Broken\",\"I'm Not The One\",\"The More I Search )The More I Die\",\"Fair Enough\" and \"Time Will Do The Talking\" all  showcase this predominantly. Her take on \"Dirty Old Town\" seems to almost illustrate her own attitude and is presented here in two versions,the later longer and far more spare. The rhythm goes up on the very heavily funky \"I'm Tired\",and actually goes very much the opposite direction on the night time bluesy soul of \"Crazy\" and \"Yesterday Is Here\". Neil Young's \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\" gets a countrified treatment whereas Sly's title song goes more to the gospel roots of the song.\n\n  One appealing thing about LaVette right off the bat is that,as an interpretive singer,she never veers from altering the song lyrics in certain ways to personalize it,have it make more sense that she's singing them. On the other hand all the songs selected for thing album already make sense in terms of her doing them. And considering that this is the first full length Bettye LaVette album I've ever heard,the fact that comes out so strongly even for a relative newcomer such as myself speaks volumes for her ability to grab the attention of the largely uninitiated.  Also it helps if one is a music lover getting into more interpretive singers at a given time anyway as I am at this point. Even still the overall effect I get from this is that I'd never have known they weren't originals given her take on them.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"This album is OUTSTANDING.  Why in the hell are we not hearing more about these guys???!!!!  Terry Kath Chicago fans UNITE!  CTA is the REAL deal, and the new songs fit well and show this group has fantastic potential. With all the hubbub about the latest release of Chicago's \"lost\" Stone of Sisyphus, I think I'm going to puke.  The reviews for SOS all sound like old fans trying to convince themselves that SOS is the best since the Terry Kath days and that they should be excited and happy.  It might be best, but it is still a gigantic cry from that early magic. Chicago since Terry Kath's passing and even the \"transitional\" Hot Streets album is a completely different band and should have changed their name.  All the blues and grit from the early days has continued to be replaced with slick production, synthesizers, and seriously stripped down guitar.  California Transit Authority DOES have that early magic, and I hope and pray they can continue to create and perform.  The WORD must get out. And before you get the idea these guys are just an old Chicago cover band, forget it!  They add their own spice and the new songs show they are every bit as inovative and appealing.  Be prepared to be blown away.\n\nIt is truly tragic that Pankow, Loughnane, Parazaider, and Lamm are not a part of Danny's new adventure. The songs are polished, the sound is GREAT, and, if they are honest with themselves, as musicians (with any personality conflicts set aside), I would imagine they would be crying inside not having been part of this wonderful project.\n\nWhen I first heard that the brass sound on the tracks was done on keyboard, I thought it would sound nothing but cheesy.  NO WAY.  No way at all.  In fact, when I listen to the tracks, I cannot tell the difference except on 25 or 6 to 4 which, I believe, was done live.  I can easily imagine that Pankow, Loughnane, and Parazaider made the studio sessions in secret, but due to contractual obligations, they are not credited. Wouldn't that be a gas?!  Anyway, time will tell if the band can pull off some new tunes that equal or surpass Pankow's inovative big brass sound.\n\nThe new musicans really, really cook!!!  Marc Bonilla is fantastic find.  Though no one can replace Kath, Bonilla has his own magic and the playing is phenomenal. He definitely HAS the down and dirty blues.  Larry Braggs from Tower of Power is a perfect fit for the group. All the other musicans are just great, and they play tight.\n\nOne more comment.  I already knew that Danny was a rock drum genius, but this album makes it painfully clear he was an extremely essential ingredient to the early Chicago sound.\n\nIf you like the Terry Kath Chicago, this is an absolute must buy.

Upon listening it becomes clear very quickly she has not only the voice but also the songs to back up this confidence.\n\nIf I didn't know any better, I'd have just as easily guessed this was from 1978 than 2005, sharing as it does a real kinship in sound to (then) emerging singers like Chrissie Hynde, Debbie Harry and in particular Kate Bush. Like Bush's debut 'The Kick Inside', arrangements here swoon and soar, choruses surprise and there's an almost frightening level of intensity at times, which makes for riveting listening throughout. It's also an album that's unafraid to tackle difficult subject matter, though for me, much of it is simply about attempting to transcend life's limitations.\n\nAfter all that verbosity, all you really need to know is this is a beautiful collection of songs by a striking new artist - and if you like her brother Rufus, then odds are you'll like Martha Wainwright too.","classification":4,"fold":0}

It manages to be simultaneously serene and deeply upsetting, and that can't be an easy thing for a composer to do. As an isolated soundtrack listen, it is thus an acquired taste that might well be worth trying to acquire for a soundtrack listener or a fan of the composers' other works.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Honestly, there are few and far between songs that have been more than worthwhile from the 2000 decade. There have been more songs about the artists' images, rather than the sincerity from the heart. But it is very rare that a song from television that has stood the test of time even after the fame. That has been the case when The Fray came out in the 2000 decade. They were alright in regards to their music with a few songs. But however, when their songs made it big for shows like Grey's Anatomy. That has shown with one of my favorite guilty pleasure songs from that decade, How To Save A Life. The song really is The Fray's biggest hit at the soul and song at heart. It is one of those songs that really is worth what the money is from the group. They have honestly had other songs that were worth that dollar as well like You Found Me a few years later. But if you really would like to hear one song from The Fray, well this would be the song that you should go to first. I recommend you download this track.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Back in 1985\/86, Slash Records seemed to be on the brink of starting a whole new American Breed of Rockers. They had new albums and new bands from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Los-Lobos\/dp\/B000CCD0F8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Los Lobos<\/a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Blasters\/dp\/B000VUTP4G\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Blasters<\/a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Bodeans\/dp\/B00005Y1Y4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Bodeans<\/a>. They all got sort of lumped into the 'new wave' category, but there was something more going on here. \"Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams\" was one of the best embodiments of this group of bands, and reissue, almost 25 years after the fact, shows why.\n\nThe Bodeans were young and enthusiastic kids who wanted to make their own sound. Being from Wisconsin, they has no burning desire to be trendy or fashionable, just to make music that felt like escape to them. With the first thrilling notes of \"She's A Runaway\" and the rocking theme of breakout the song offers, it's an instant classic that should have slotted in comfortably next to the Springsteen or Mellencamp hits of the day. T-Bone Burnette heard the truth inside the songs and the vocal magic Kurt Neumann and Sam Llanas made, and hauled them away to Los Angeles to make this album. \"Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams\" is a missing link of an album, the chain the runs between The Everly Brothers and The Rolling Stones (from whom the album nicked its title).\n\nThe remaster sounds incredible. The BoDeans were still fresh and excited, with T-Bone at the top of his early production game. \"Rickshaw Riding\" has sudden space in its slowbreathing sound. \"Looking for Me Somewhere\" sounds like Johnny Cash passed on it to hand it over to these youngsters. And the bonus track \"Turn Your Radio On\" makes you wonder why this Chuck Berry-ish rocker got left behind.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Finest work? Best ever? Better than 'All I intended to be'? Come on! I think there are half a dozen decent tracks here, the remainder are so depressing I really don't want more than one listen. 'Emmett Till' and 'Darlin Kate' may be well-intentioned and personal but boy do they drag. 'Big Black Dog' is embarrassing, whatever Emmylou's involvement with canine welfare. She is wonderful, we all love her. I'm afraid this album doesn't make it for me\nI refer you to the Amazon UK review which I  think is spot on:\n\nAfter a 40-year career which has generated over 25 albums, countless collaborations, twelve Grammy wins, membership of the Country Music Hall of Fame and the undying gratitude of several figures in country music, it's only fair that Emmylou Harris has earned the right to a bit of self-indulgence.\nAlas, though, often self-indulgence doesn't work. Harris' genius has always been to take a song and own it, to make it her own. Whether it were an old Louvin Brothers number everyone had forgotten, or a completely new take on a Patsy Cline classic, her voice would transform it.\n\nThe trouble with Harris is that she's never been much of a songwriter. Actually, that's not correct, quite: there was one instance where her self-penned work was wonderful. Boulder to Birmingham, written shortly after the death of her collaborator, duettist and friend, Gram Parsons, was a highlight of 1975's Pieces of the Sky album. This set begins with another tribute to Gram, The Road; but where the former was full of imagery and allusion, this one makes its point in the most prosaic of ways. All but two of these songs are self-written, but the only one that resonates is Darlin' Kate, written for her close friend, the late Kate McGarrigle. Here it feels as though she forgets what she is trying to do and just writes from her heart.","classification":3,"fold":0}

Although there have been a few tracks over the past few years (Swedish Mafia's \"Greyhound\" and Avicci's \"Levels\",etc.) that have turned me on, this is a deliciously wicked track with a slightly twisted, dark edge that I love. It appeals to me as both a listener and as a dancer, somewhat in the same way Darude's \"Sandstorm\" did.

I'm not sure that Disco or MTV ended the ambitious musical voyages of the late 60's and early to mid 70's. Probably corporate imaging of rock and roll (that would be MTV).  Just wait until the corporations get involved with the legalization of cannabis.  If you think the fun went out of music hold your bong hit. This remix mastered by Steven Wilson brings more justice to this masterpiece.  For me, Steven has brought every nuance to the forefront of the sound.  All these years later and I am startled by how different this music is from Yes's previous endeavors.  Wakeman shines despite his indifference to the music when Tales was released back in 1973.  Alan White's drum work is also prominent.  The bass of the late Chris Squire is groundbreaking.  Anderson is in form.  Steve Howe's guitar interplays more with the other instruments.  Artistically the best Yes album.  Thanks you Steven for the remix.  I know Chris is playing along.  Long live ambitious music.","classification":5,"fold":0}

Some of his songs, like \"Nothing on You\" and \"The Way You Are\", Mars hits the right notes in being the caring boyfriend, but still being confident and energetic.  \"When I Was Your Man\" is not nearly as successful.\n\n  In this song, Mars comes off like a whiny, whipped ex-boyfriend.  If you listen to, and read, the lyrics, it's about how he should have catered to every single wish and whim of girl he's singing to but, because he didn't, they are no longer together, and he is moping about it.  Being attentive and caring about your woman is incredibly important, but the degree to which Mars makes it seem like he needs to be in this song, he would be easily controlled and not very interesting to the girl after she got used to be fawned over.\n\n  Mars nails it most of the time.

{"text":"Covers of songs by famous artists are prone to suffer from one of two flaws: either the artist recording the cover is so eager to stamp it with his or her own style that the song is transformed into something utterly different (and usually far inferior to the original), or the cover is so blindly derivative as to be pointless and ultimately forgettable.\n\nEsperanza Spalding's cover of Billie Holiday's \"I'll Look Around\" gets it exactly right.  Compared to Holiday's version, which was filled with languorous yearning, Spalding's is a little smoother and more upbeat, bringing an almost whimsical note to this song of lost love.  The background is easy-listening jazz - it's the sort of thing you might expect to hear playing softly in a classy restaurant.  Spalding's voice is just as appealing, silky and fluidly sensuous.  This is an old-fashioned song with a timeless sound, and Spalding has made it her own for a modern audience.\n\nNo matter your tastes, this track is sure to add a touch of loveliness to your music collection.

{"text":"\"So Calm\" is a very enjoyable song.  The message in the lyrics is very lovely and romantic, and the music has an overall ethereal quality.\n\nThe drums and keyboards are great and very energetic in places, but the lead vocals and the back-ups clash just a bit.  At first, these qualities seemed just a bit out of place in a song that was otherwise soothing.  But then I realized that the falling and rising energy levels provided the illusion of the tide rising and falling.  Ultimately, the pulsing rhythm, along with the new-age keyboards and slightly clashing background, added to the overall other-worldly and calming effect of the song.\n\nThis is a great song, but it may be a bit of an acquired taste.  If you give it a chance, it will probably grow on you.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"I really wanted to love this because I love working out and I love classical music. But for me, the most important things about workout music are: 1. it has a strong beat, and 2. the beat is steady. The beats and tempos in this mix are too variable, often too slow, and sometimes there is very little beat at all. I mean, Wagner as workout music? Debussy? Seriously?\n\nFortunately, there are some good pieces, and when I deleted the ones that were the worst (in my opinion), I still had 68 tracks, which is excellent for 99 cents. I might delete more of them, and perhaps add some of my own, but as another reviewer said, this can serve as the basis for a good classical workout mix. I think more dance music and marches, and fewer opera arias and piano concerto movements would have been better. So, 3 stars for this one from me.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"I've been buying Amazon music for a while now and I love how Amazon offers low cost music and even free music from new artists. I listen to radio mostly and frequently I get tired of the same stuff and definitely tired of the over-played stuff (even if it's a great beat like Lady Gaga's \"Poker Face\"). I've never heard of Franz Ferdinand and I first heard \"Take me out\" on Amazon. The more I review songs the more I'm aware of my alternative music tastes (especially alternative music reminiscent of 1990's alternative).\n\nFor me, good alt-music has a rock beat with a twist--something different, unexpected, experimental even. I think this can be subtle or obvious and very subjective definitely (in the eye of the beholder or the ear in this case). Sometimes a repetitive beat is annoying (one reason modern country music doesn't do it for me); but sometimes it's classic (like Elvis Costello's \"Pump it up,\" Chuck Berry's \"Johnny B. Goode,\" or Elvis Presley \"That's Alright Mama\" and even some old-skanky-country like Hank Williams' \"I'm so lonesome I could cry\"--old-skanky-country is a term of endearment made up entirely by me). By no means am I comparing \"Take me out\" to the classics, I'm trying to explain how I base my reviews.\n\nWhat caught my ear on \"Take me out\" was the initial repetitive rock beat (it's fast with a hint of punk) guitar and drums dominate; it's a great mix with the singer's voice (is he singing or screaming--it's hard to tell, there's an angry sound to his voice which is fitting with the punk aspect of the music). A minute into it, the beat transitions to a slower, deeper, harder rock sound (hm, interesting choice of words yes? If good music doesn't make you think sex, maybe it's not good music. Anyway, a very sexy transition IMO). There are hints of 70's disco in the cymbals in the chorus (or what I think is the chorus). There isn't much variety in the lyrics or rhythm for that matter; but sometimes that just doesn't matter. The beat keeps the song moving along. The lyrics do borderline on the monotonous but it's an easy song to sing to--maybe Franz doesn't have much to say. It's the only song I've listened to from Franz Ferdinand. I like it, a lot.\n\nWith Amazon's 20 million songs, there is so much to listen to! I rated this song 5 stars because I am very happy with my purchase. I love songs that are a change from the mainstream.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"One thing I could tell for sure with the 2013 collaboration with Dam Funk on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/7-Days-Of-Funk-Explicit\/dp\/B00F4YS4VE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">7 Days Of Funk [Explicit<\/a>] that Snoop Dogg was planning on expanding on his funkier musical emotions. It was a journey that he started in the early 90's via samples. During that time? It was only the original music that was BEING sampled that had any interest to me at all. The alternative rock and hip-hop scenes of the time help absolutely no interest to me. And to a large degree still don't really. Sometimes? That's a position I am more than proud to hold. Other times? Elements of that culture I personally detest showcase artists running to something creatively wonderful. It was Pharrell Williams who a decade ago who helped revive Snoop Doggs career with heavy,straight up funk. He just didn't extend it across an entire album. This new release is a total collaboration between the two that looks to remedy that situation.\n\n  \"California Roll\" is an electric piano led mid-tempo groove,led by the harmonica and vocal harmonies of Stevie Wonder. \"This City\",\"R U A Freak\",the rhythm guitar led \"Awake\",\"So Many Pros\" and the enormous hit with Charlie Wilson \"Peaches 'N Cream\" are a non stop post disco\/boogie funk party-with that current Pharrell style instrumental and production sheen that has been functioning so well instrumentally for him in the last three years. \"Edibles\" is a slower,more stomping electronic P-Funk style number with TI as a guest vocalist. \"I Knew That\" and \"Run Away\",featuring Gwen Stefani on a great call and response rapped vocal with Snoop Dogg both have a sturdy,rhythm guitar led hard and slow stomping boogie funk variation about them \"I'm Ya Dogg\" ends the album in a more synthesizer textured modern hip-hop number with raps from Kedrick Lamar and Rick Ro$$. Personally it's my least favorite song on the entire album.\n\n  Admittedly I haven't heard all of Snoop Dogg's music. But this album actually succeeds in having a very strong and committed focus on funk as a musical genre. Pharrell and Snoop are very comfortable musical bedfellows here-both really positively involved with the talents that both have to offer. Especially in terms of instrumental and vocal flow. Wouldn't exactly call it a P-Funk inspired album however-as the sound of it actually reminds me more of the Solar\/Kashif productions of the early 80's. Which...it would seem Pharrell is most inspired by as a producer\/musician to begin with. Lyrically speaking? Well that's where I deduct a star. Speaking as a proud advocate for marijuana for medicinal purposes? Snoop Dogg's stoner persona is one aspect of his personality that I've always found irritating in large doses. Same goes for people I admire greatly as musical figures such as George Clinton and the late Rick James. Difference is both of them were also excellent storytellers about life,politics and sex. This album mostly focuses on one person personally benefiting from 420 basically. Luckily? The wonderful fluidity of the music,compositions and presentation make this a worthwhile funky exercise.","classification":4,"fold":0}

There are references to bands like Echo & the Bunnymen, Placebo, Editors, New Order, Manic Street Preachers, British Sea Power.  \"Elpintor\" is not a bad album.  I truly enjoyed listening to it.  But I don't hear anything calling me back for a second round.  Interpol has a great feel for thick, churning tunes that mix a melancholic roar with melody & drama.

{"text":"Let me lay the backstory on you first, and Ill begin with the albums title Wednesday Morning, 3AM, debuting in 1964, coming from the fact that on a Wednesday night, our dashing duo had just finished their last song at 3AM in a Greenwich Village folk club, and were homeward bound to their digs in Queens  or perhaps it all had to do with the song Wednesday Morning, 3AM.  Regardless, the iconic photo was taken at that Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street stop.  The photo shoot proved problematic as several hundred images where taken that turned out to be unusable due to an all familiar suggestion that had been penned on the tiled wall, which inspired the writing of the future song A Poem On The Underground Wall, from the album Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme.\n\nIts not uncommon for an initial outing to be a mixed bag of original material, covers, and arrangements of traditional songs, which was the case here, with their cover of Dylans The Times They Are A-Changin ushering them into the inner circle for all things Bob Dylan, and gaining cross-over fans.  For the most part the album was largely acoustically focused, and largely unremarkable, so unremarkable, along with the invasion of The Beatles, that Simon & Garfunkel broke up, with Paul headed off to the UK, and Art going back to school.  It wouldnt be until the track Sounds Of Silence was reworked as the opening number on their following album, and was presented in a more haunting rock n roll manner, that Simon & Garfunkel secured a place on the musical map and never looked back.\n\nThe release was so overshadowed by the Sound Of Silence album that many people completely overlooked it, and with that hit single being on both albums [though as differing versions], it caused confusion for many.  Regardless, what shines most on this release are the traditional and cover songs, where the duo come off as energetic, harmonious, and emotionally sincere.  While sounding sincere and ambitious, the album comes across somewhat disjointed because of this non-original material, and the fact that the songs seemed to have been chosen at random, without consideration for the contextual flow needed for a concise body of work.  While certainly better than their Tom & Jerry [with name taken from the Tom & Jerry cat and mouse comic] material, theyve stepped headlong into an Everly Brothers \/ Peter, Paul and Mary-ish adaptation, making the album sound a bit flat, thin, campy and uninspired.\n\nIm trying hard to bring something positive to the table, yet in all honesty, there is little I can say about this album to make it seem worth not only your while, but your investment.  The one thing Simon & Garfunkel did, which was similar, though not as dramatic as Dylan at Newport, was that they stepped out of the crooning vocal era of the late 50s, and into the folk scene, and then nearly single handedly reinvented the folk attitude, flying under the banner of folk-rock, though still heavy on the folk side  so yes, in a sense this is an important album as a bookmark of sorts, though holds little of lasting value.\n\nYou Can Tell the World by bob Gibson and Bob Camp\nLast Night I Had the Strangest Dream by Ed McCurdy\nBleecker Street by Paul Simon\nSparrow\" by Paul Simon\nBenedictus Traditional Arrangement by Simon & Garfunkel\nThe Sounds Of Silence by Paul Simon\nHe Was My Brother by Paul Kane\nPeggy-O Traditional Arrangement by Paul Simon\nGo Tell It On The Mountain Traditional Arrangement by Paul Simon\nThe Sun Is Burning by Ian Campbell\nThe Times They Are A-Changin by Bob Dylan\nWednesday Morning, 3AM by Paul Simon\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","classification":2,"fold":0}

The rest of the songs range from come ons to girls to typical contempary R&B sounds of bragging, sex, etc. Nothing really new. I guess you could say that his last album before this (not counting the one he did with Bow Wow),&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/21\/dp\/B000H30BW2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">21<\/a>&nbsp;was in a similar vein. HOWEVER, although \"21\" talked about sex too mostly it had bangin', current beats to accompany the songs. That is the difference that ultimately makes this more mediocre than his last solo project.\n\nSo in the end, this project unlike \"21\" is pretty skip-able. There aren't really any money tracks at all although if you like your typical topics of R&B in 2010 and beyond, you might be right at home with this album. All I know is that he's capable of more.\n\n3 stars.","classification":3,"fold":0}

I thought she had a terrific voice. Years later she would be employed as a backup singer for the great Joe Cocker.

{"text":"This is really the biggest surprise of the year thus far. I mean, this girl comes off the American Idol of England, comes to the states, and this song comes out of nowhere building radio play all the way to #1. What's the secret? Apparently America just loves those female R&B Love Song vibes.\n\nLeona Lewis herself has a rather good voice, and carries herself pretty well throughout the song. The song itself is pretty darn standard in the R&B Love Song genre, so it could be sung by Mariah, or any artist in that mold for that matter. No ground is broken, but it is a nice listen, and so far, it has not annoyed me to death, so that's always a positive.\n\nSo overall, nothing brilliant, nothing new, but Leona Lewis seems to nice enough to be let on my radio dial. And, even though this might be saying much, this song might be better than most of Mariah's work, since her stuff is so overly done, it's pathetic. It's also a nice change of pace that Leona isn't practically begging her lover to touch her body like another certain artist has done. ;)","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Many people cite The Love I Lost, from late 1973-early 1974 as the first disco song. It has all the elements from the disco beat to the use of strings. I would say the Trammps with Zing Went the Strings of My Heart had all the disco elements down including the strings, and that was in late 1972, over a year earlier. But the Trammps song was minor and The Love I Lost was a huge mega-hit, so it's known to far more people. Disco evolved out of the Philly sound of Gamble and Huff, and taht's who Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes recorded for.\n\nBut forget labels like disco anyway (some people don't like the term), and what you've got is a smooth orchestra, a driving rhythm and Teddy Pendergrass singing his heart out. It's a great R&B classic and is as fresh today as it was when it was released. There was a long version on the album, but that just had an extended interlude for dancing because dance music was expected to be more than a three minute AM tune. But for just listening I think the single is better as the dance interlude gets a bit repetitious on the long version if you're just listening. It deserves to be in this collection.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"The prelude; Michael Jackson and Chris Tucker having a conversation about a girl they're supposedly looking at, though there isn't any background noise to help set the scene; is like the skit at the beginning of Black Or White. It may be funny initially, but it's replay value is nowhere near that of the song it introduces. Listeners of at-least the official album versions of these tracks may, in other words, find themselves skipping past, or at-least zoning-out on, the first several seconds. That means the tracks, essentially the songs, would be better without their preludes. In the case of You Rock My World, the title of which doesn't come across nearly as corny as it should, the song would also make more sense without it. The dialogue implies that the girl is a total stranger to both Chris and Mike, but the song lyrics have Jackson already romantically entwined with her.\n\n\"It feels like I've finally found a perfect love this time,\" he insists before going into one of his best choruses yet. \"You rocked my world, you know you did,\" it goes, utilizing a harmonic vocal stack similar to the haunting Ghosts, \"Who'd think I'd find someone like you to call mine?\" The words are trite; on paper the song would read like a high school crush poem; but the vocal melodies, even on the verses and bridge, are quite awesome. The music, highlighted by dramatic keyboard strings where applicable, is a slinky soul groove that goes back to the relative timelessness of the Thriller album. Despite an unnecessary scratch break near the end; the ad-lib peak section should take the song out; it's producer Rodney Jerkins at his best. It's not Michael Jackson at his best, but it's damn close. If the quality of this love theme is any indication, I'd guess he got the girl.\n\nmarcellee.com","classification":5,"fold":0}

This is quite a remarkable achievement since a pairing up of Mozart and Gabriel Faur&eacute; really shouldn't work. But it does work, and work wonderfully.\n\nMozart's Vesperae Solennes blends into Faur&eacute;'s Requiem so seamlessly that the first few times I listened to the album, I had to check the track listing to make sure whether the Mozart had ended and the Faur&eacute; begun yet.\n\nThey do sound different, don't get me wrong, with over a hundred years between them. But both works, performed beautifully by The Sixteen (the choir) and the Academy of St-Martin-in-the-Fields, radiate a warm tranquility, and this mood carries over seamlessly from one to the other, across a century.\n\nA really great disc, highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"The state of Alabama has long been known as a hotbed of musical talent. It's also been known for the city of Muscle Shoals- which housed a recording studio that housed some of the biggest names from the 1960's up to the 1980's. Though most of Alabama's talent tend to lend more toward country and R&B, the state has brought us some familiar names within the last decade. In recent years, there's been three American Idol contestants (Ruben Studdard, Bo Bice, Taylor Hicks), Brent Hinds of the heavy metal act Mastodon and the Athens quartet Alabama Shakes. The quartet is fronted by lead singer and primary songwriter Brittany Howard- whose voice owes a huge debt to singers like Janis Joplin and Genya Ravan. The remaining members are bassist Zac Cockrell, drummer Steve Johnson and guitarist Heath Fogg. The origins of Alabama Shakes started in high school when two of the members started writing songs together in high school. One member was asked to join while working at a local music store and the other joined after hearing their demo. After working with a local record producer, they released an EP, played at a festival and was given a recording contract all within the span of a year.\n\nThey released their debut \"Boys & Girls\" in Spring 2012 on Dave Matthews' label ATO Records. The recording received rave reviews and even earned the band a Gold certification from the RIAA. Exactly three years after their debut, the band released their sophomore effort  \"Sound & Color\". Though they felt at home with in their Stax Records influenced music, they decided to take things in a different direction this time around. Musically, they've added keyboards and vibraphones, but still remain true to their sound. They also took a  more direct approach to making a radio friendly record, which actually sounds better than their debut. The album opens with the title track \"Sound & Color\", where they are content with having a peace of mind. On the uptempo \"Don't Wanna Fight\", the song centers around a woman who wants to extend an olive branch to her partner to avoid their constant bickering. They think about the deceased on \"Future People\", while Brittany sings of wanting to love someone dealing with personal issues on the first single \"Gimme All Your Love\". They are content with having an ally on \"This Feeling\", while being unsure about her feelings toward an ex on the ballad \"Miss You\". Being optimistic toward a new relationship is the theme of the song \"Gemini\", while they end the album with the ambient ballad \"Over My Head\". \"Sound & Color\" is a great album by Alabama Shakes. Though it's radically different from its predecessor, it's a step forward from a band that seems to like making music their way. With that frame of mind, expect to hear more great things from them in the near future.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Wow!  This is just amazing! When I first heard about a song titled \"Batman Evolution\" I thought, \"If I were to make a song called 'Batman Evolution', I would take the 1966 Neal Hefti theme, the 1989 Danny Elfman theme, and the 2008 Hanz Zimmer theme, and make a compilation of the three.\"; and I'll be darned if that's not exactly what The Piano Guys did with this one.\nStarting with a quiet intro from the \"Keaton\" theme, it quickly dives into the '66 \"Nana nana nana nana nana, Batman!\" theme. This theme is hard to take very seriously, so this portion is shorter than the other two. That being said, it pays a perfect homage to the original, campy series with a couple \"riffs\" that sound like the \"Pow!, Bang!\" sound effects from the show. There are even vocals shouting Batman! to complete the feel of the original tune. Then it moves onto, probably, the most famous and recognizable of the three: Danny Elfman's 1989 theme. It's easy to picture Keaton's Batmobile cruising through the woods of Gotham, flames licking the road behind it. This portion starts slow, then gets into main gear. The sound gets darker and grittier with the 89 theme. Enough of the theme is in this compilation to satisfy the ones for whom Keaton's Batman is the favorite. Then after a lone cello lilts a small bridge, the Dark Knight theme starts up. At\nthis point, the song gains strength and majesty until it takes up your whole attention. Then, all of the sudden, it ends. On the one hand, it sounds abrupt, and you're left wanting more; on the other hand, it ends exactly the way it should, disappearing into thin air. Just like the Batman.\nI can't wait for the video! Seeing TPG playing amongst the three most famous batmobiles is going to be every bit as impressive as the song.","classification":5,"fold":0}

Can someone else like me who doesn't know a thing about reggae or Jimmy Cliff really enjoy an album like this the way that I do?  Yes.  But why?\n\n\"Reggae music gonna make me feel good \/ reggae music gonna make me feel alright now\" (\"Reggae Music\") - if you've ever felt a little down and out (and haven't we all?) the bouncy shuffle of a reggae beat can pick up your mood, and can do so regardless of what the lyrics say.  The first track \"World Upside Down\" name checks war, poverty, prosperity, morality, injustice, religious hypocrisy, political tyranny, crime, violence, starvation, ecological calamity, economic instability, sanity, vanity, and love, love, love, love, love, love, love - but still made me feel like I was at a party.  You get the message and you get to party at the same time.\n\nWhether Cliff is singing\/speaking in a clear and sincere style (\"World Upside Down\") baring his falsetto soul (\"Cry No More\") or channeling James Brown (the intro to \"Bang\") he sounds like a man half his age and its fun to hear him work through these songs, songs that clearly share a certain reggaeness but are all different enough to keep things interesting and to expose to even the uninitiated reggae listener what strong ties and influences this musical style shares with rock, pop, soul, gospel, rap, hip hop, and R&B.\n\nGet your reggae on, and no matter what's going on, your world should get a little brighter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nConstant Listener","classification":5,"fold":0}

There is more potential for greatness on this record then I have heard in some time from any band, if they only reach it occasionally.\n\n\"Memories\", the records lead off track, is the records best ssong, all minor key harmonies and a twisting, melodic as all else breakdown which is one of the coolest things I have heard this year. The next song \"Telescopic Eyes\" is another keeper, showcasing the bands darker form of melodic pop, catchy enough for radio but different enough for the rest of us.\n\nFrom there the record is spotty. Or actually it's not. There really isn't a quote-unquote bad song on the record, it just gets a bit same soundy as it goes on. The group shows such potential and talent on the first handful of tunes that as the record goes on and the song remains the same you get kind of dissapointed. Maybe some changes in tone, maybe a little, just a little distortion, maybe some different types of arrangements could fix this problem. I don't know.\n\nBut I say buy this record. It is good, and this band could very easily be great a record or two from now. \"Room Noises\" is promising, even if it doesn't deliver fully on said potential.

{"text":"This is Katy Perry's third studio album, and since I loved Teenage Dream so much, it was a no-brainer to pick this one up.  I went ahead and sprung for the Deluxe Edition because those are often better.  Well, let's see how this album holds up:\n\nRoar (5\/5)  - This song is fun and uplifting, and unlike a lot of other uplifting songs, this one truly feels fun and empowering instead of dark and depressing.  Also, it works much better lyrically than \"Firework\" (from Teenage Dream) did at being a motivational song.\n\nLegendary Lovers (4\/5) - This song's interesting; it has got a sort of Asian flare to its sound, and it makes for a nice contrast to the other songs and helps it to be unique.\n\nBirthday (4\/5) - I actually didn't care for this one at first, as it struck me initially as a bit bland musically, but it's really grown on me.  It's a pretty obvious birthday\/sex metaphor, but despite the cheesy lyrics, it's an enjoyable song regardless.\n\nWalking On Air (4\/5) - This one's nice -it's quite energetic.  A few lyrics are kinda corny like rhyming \"erotica\" with exotica, but its pleasant to listen to.\n\nUnconditionally (3\/5)  I can't say I care much for this song.  It's just okay  not terrible, not great, just okay.\n\nDark Horse (Feat. Juicy J) (5\/5)  This is probably the stand-out track on the album  it's catchy, has a unique sound compared to the other album tracks, and is just generally nice to listen to.\n\nThis Is How We Do (4\/5)  I like this song, too.  It's not the best song ever, but it's decent and perfectly listenable.\n\nInternational Smile (3\/5)  This song has some vapid lyrics, and generally feels a bit like a filler song - however, it's saved by the nice chorus.\n\nGhost (4\/5)  This is a tonal shift in the album since the song is a lot darker in subject matter than the previous entries.  Normally, I'm not too fond of the slower songs, but this one is saved by it's catchy chorus.\n\nLove Me (3\/5) - Meh, this song isn't horrible, but not very interesting either.  It's like \"Ghost\" but without an interesting\/catchy chorus to keep it afloat, so it doesn't appeal to me much.\n\nThis Moment (3\/5) - This one is rather dull, but not unlistenable.  It really has the same problems that \"Love Me\" does, and doesn't really stick in my mind.\n\nDouble Rainbow (4\/5)  When I first saw the song title, I was really afraid that this song would be about that stupid youtube video where the guy goes \"Oh, double rainbow  but what does it mean?\".  Thankfully, that's not the case.  It's actually a rather sweet love song, and is surprisingly good.\n\nBy The Grace Of God (4\/5) - This song is reasonably good.  It's a slower song, but builds to a strong chorus.  It's a decent song, but not a must-listen for me.\n\nSpiritual (4\/5) - This song's actually quite good for a slower song, and I like it just fine.\n\nIt Takes Two (2\/5)  I really find this song a bit grating, maybe because of the really repetitive chorus, or the fact that it feels like it goes on too long (even though it isn't particularly long in reality, it feels like it drags).  Either way, I don't care for it.\n\nChoose Your Battles (4\/5) - This song's actually pretty good.  It's got decent energy and is a good listen.\n\nOverall Score (4\/5): NOTE this score is not a mathematical average of previous scores; its my subjective overall score.  It's too bad that this album isn't as high quality as the Teenage Dream album  it honestly feels like there are more \"meh\" songs here than there were there.  This is certainly an album that's uneven in execution with the better songs towards the upper half, but it's still generally listenable all the way through, so I'm overall pleased.  Her previous work, Teenage Dream, was certainly better (and I suggest the Complete Confection version of that album to get all the extra goodies), but this is a respectable effort, too.  I suppose this all comes down to personal preference, as many people seem to enjoy Katy Perry's new more mature direction, but I don't listen to Katy Perry for poignant emotional songs  I listen to her music for fun, catchy, upbeat music, so this release didn't do as much for me.  Nonetheless, it's a respectable effort, and I'd still recommend it to Katy Perry fans.","classification":4,"fold":0}
{"text":"Jason Mraz is definitely an underrated artist in the music world. It's all too easy to write him off as another John Mayer\/Dave Matthews type artist. Nope, M.R.A.Z. is a whole nother breed. He has a little bit country, little bit rap, bit adult alt, bit pop, bit folk, the point is, Mraz can do it all. And this song shows all those elements, and the song writing style of Mraz. Even though this song was co-written by The Matrix song writing group, you can tell which parts are theirs, and which parts are Mraz.\n\nFirst off, the opening lines are awesome, and really set the tone for the verses. They're out of the ordinary, but seem to fit, and most importantly flow. And that's what this song's got going for it the most, flow. The verses, the pre-chorus, the chorus all flow freely even though they all have their unique style. This is accomplished for the most part by Mraz's vocals. The structure is also unique in that it has the verses which are great in of themselves, then you have the pre-chorus which could be a chorus in its own right, and then you have the chorus, which is in true radio-friendly style to grab those radio people, and has the true influence of The Matrix.\n\nIn fact, the only thing you could really criticize the song about is the pre-chorus, as it may just be one chorus too many, or maybe it could be a thinly veiled reference to sex or something. In either case, it both works, and it doesn't. I personally think it should have its own song, although it does great in this song.\n\nSo overall, definitely not your everyday radio fare. It may have a few of those elements, but it has enough originality to keep you interested and tuned in. Kudos to everybody involved with song. It's well-written, well-sung, and well-structured. This song is just another in the long list of reasons to love Jason Mraz.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"After glancing over the track list, I recognized roughly half of these songs as 60's and 70's pop songs:  The Beatles' \"And I Love Her,\" the Rolling Stones' \"Lady Jane,\" Billy Joel's \"Just the Way You Are,' among others. Don't let the title or cover art mislead you; these are not classical music covers. Most of these songs have a Latin flavor to them and the entire album would provide innocuous background music at your next dinner party or simply to serve as the soundtrack at the end of a long day as you unwind with your favorite beverage. Is this muzak? Well...that word has such a negative connotation. There is nothing engaging or exciting about this music, but if all you are looking for is something that will fill the silence, but at the same time not distract you, this might be the aural blanket to wrap yourself in that you were looking for.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"It is honestly so sad whenever someone young and talented throws their voice away, and they've worn out their sex appeal and voice aside. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles has been one of those singers that has been more of a product than a real songstress. It is honestly very sad because she has made songs that have not really delivered, they have just been so overplayed like the manufactured voice at hand, not the songstress on the inside, unlike other divas that were worth something like Whitney Houston and Natalie Cole. When it came down to Ms. Knowles surprise album that she came out with in 2013, it actually has been more like a joke than a \"wow\" factor. Most of the songs have been more like jokes at hand, like Partition. She didn't feel like she igniting in the sex appeal, instead she felt more like a whimper overall. I really didn't like the song, and she really hasn't grown to be more of the diva at the absolute soul. Overall, if you are new to Beyonce's music, I would recommend passing his song up, and go to Crazy In Love, when she used to have a voice.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":0}

{"text":"This is a re-release of the original 1969 album with no extras. Note that it is *not* the Rhino release from 2001 which had a dozen or so bonus tracks and singles added but which is almost impossible to find at the time of writing.\n\nAs an album...well, it's OK. It's a reminder of what a good singer Cher was, even without the gloss and electronics she went in for later. She has a fine natural voice which she uses very well, there's a good band with a quality horn section added at times and as a period piece it's decent music making. Frankly, though, the material lets it down.\n\nIt's largely good material: Dylan, Stills & Young, Otis Redding...they're classy names. However, if you're going to cover a song which a great artist has already recorded in a classic version, you need to do something very different or very special, and Cher doesn't really manage either here. After four and a half decades the generic late-60s sound and arrangements sound pretty bland, and much of the real soul, passion or eroticism is drained out of these songs. Dock Of The Bay has none of Otis's agonised hopelessness and \"Lay Baby Lay\" (!) lacks any of Dylan's laid back, sexy delivery, for example, and the same is true pretty well throughout.\n\nFor me this is an interesting collection to look back on, but a good singer is largely wasted here, I think. It's available pretty cheaply so you may want to give it a try, but it's not one I'll be taking out and playing much, I'm afraid.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Kate Pierson has finally released her own solo cd after being in one of the best out there party bands over the past 35 years, The B'52s and I'm loving this music. To describe what this collection is all about, well it certainly not a paint by numbers pop album.  Its so full of energy, a cosmic connection , its one of the biggest surprises I've listened to in a long time. Unconventional, wordy, arty, a vocal singing celebration that just had to come out.  Harmony's and melodies and choruses bust out everywhere  I'd heard a few cuts released over the past month or so, I knew this was gonna be special, but as a whole, this is neat little pop gem exe produced by Sia and there is wonderful touches and sounds throughout, never over produced, love the electronica splashes everywhere, sure a little B-52s dance pulses in there as well but man this is burst of non stop energy, people of all ages need to hear this. My favorites on Guitars & Microphones.. the title cut is a blast of Kate's imagination and her own world she's grown up in, great song, would make a great video & radio track,  \"Throw down the roses\" starts it off and is another gem of words and music that's pure female empowerment, a highlight track... \"Time wave Zero\", end of days comes for us, and the solar system is imploding but hold on to the one you love and go out dancing! This is such a highlight of music and sounds, \"Matrix\" is another gem with a spacey vibe and awesome wordplay and music jam that never quits. \"Bottoms Up\" gives a nice slice of alt\/rock to mix up the styles on this cd, using Strokes guitarist Nick Valensi and Kate knows how to find the talents to surround herself with. \"Bring your arms\" finds Kate dealing with the issues of saving baby turtles with the talents of Sia's writing  and productions skills and Kate's trippy\/ hippy love shines through on this one. \"Crush me with your love\" and \"Wolves\", dealing with some personal issues of love and happiness that wouldn't have worked as well on a B-52s collection but on this solo collection, they standout,  again mixing up the styles makes \"GUITARS AND MICROPHONES\" stand out with repeated listens.  The first single I heard from \"Guitars and Microphones\", \"Mister Sister\" is a controversial song that took some heat from the transgender communities but it fits into this collection, \"debbie delicious\", whatever? Its a clever song about looking in the mirror and change in a positive way.  Guitars and Microphones ends with \"Pulls you under\", a heartfelt torch  stunner, Kate still has such a bright, powerful voice that's full of the most colorful wordplay, This is a fun record to pick up, once you give it a few listens, your hooked!  Kate Pierson and company must be so proud of this one. Love the bright colorful cd cover by Monica Coleman, Kate's partner and responsible for the big push that got this all made. Don't forget to check out the words to these songs, though the songs breeze like a runaway train,  there is much to think about between the lines, \"Bottoms Up\" speaks of drug addiction and the closer \"Pulls you under\" is a heartbreaking look at death and letting go, can't say enough about this awesome collection of tunes, just buy it!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"This is a score that I've been waiting to get a CD copy of since the movie was released.  It jumps around in price and it sat in my wish list until it dropped reasonably enough for me.  The album cover looks different from what they are currently showing on Amazon but I actually like the CD cover better which has the silver Terminator skull (with red eye) against a black background.  Call me crazy in this digital age but I still prefer to purchase my music on CD.\n\nThis is my third score by Lorne Balfe.  I've previously enjoyed his work on \"Blackwood\" and \"Sons of Liberty\".  Balfe is part Hans Zimmer's score production company known as Remote Control Productions.  It is home to quite a few composers who are mentored by Zimmer and he often collaborates with many on various projects.  After hearing the past few Terminator scores and not really finding them that interesting, I had high hopes that this one by Balfe would finally bring the scores back from the past and into this future.  I am happy to say that this one certainly does just that.  Lorne Balfe successfully pays tribute to Fiedel while also developing his own themes and style to the score.  Fiedel's epic themes can be heard in a few cues like \"Better Days\" (track 2), \"It's Really Me\" (track 12), and most prominently in \"Terminated\" (track 22).  Balfe's interpretation of the theme in the last track is really outstanding and it's something that fans have been waiting for.\n\nBalfe has created his own original score but you can hear hints of the classic Terminator sound throughout the music.  The composer achieves this through his use of similar keyboard effects, percussion, strings, and heavy brass instrumentation that he spins & weaves into a sound that becomes distinctively familiar to fans of the iconic music from the early films.  To Balfe's credit, he does not merely give us only a repeat of that which has already been done, but he also develops new themes and electronic \"riffs\" of his own that are quite enjoyable.  I really liked the thematic music in track 11, \"John Conner\" and I also enjoyed the new and unusual electronic sounds found in \"Family\" (track 17).  There are few cues that give Balfe a chance to slow things down a bit like \"Sarah & Kyle\" (track 5) and \"Alcove\" (track 13) but this is largely an action heavy score.  Like Fiedel's previous scores, however, I found this one to be full of interesting effects, sounds, rhythms, and ambience that makes for an entertaining listen.  I like scores that allow you to mentally picture a scene and I would say that this one does just that.  Listening to pieces like \"Sacrifice\" (19) does this quite well.  The big swooping crescendos as one character saves another and the almost angelic sounding strings praising the heroic deed can certainly give you the mental images found within the music.\n\nI had to wait a long time to finally get a copy of this but it certainly was worth the wait.  The CD contains 22 tracks and runs around 1 hour and 12 minutes.  There is a 12 page CD insert that contains track listings, production credits, orchestra credits, and a special thanks section from Balfe, Zimmer, and Paramount Pictures.  There are plenty of photos from the movie as well.  Some are two page spreads, full pages, and several smaller photos.  This a great score from Balfe and I appreciate the nod to Fiedel's music, as well as, the excellent original music too.  I recommend!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"You know, I never heard of Robert Randolph until I caught a sampling of 'The Word' album on an independent radio station about a year ago. After hearing him play the pedal steel guitar on that collaboration project, I must say I was absolutely floored! EVERYTHING about his playing will bring to mind all the things that made guys like Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Duane Allman, Carlos Santana, and Stevie Ray Vaughan as revered as they are. Simply put, the brother got \"MAD SKILLZ\"!!!\n\nThe same can also be said of his stellar backing unit known simply as the Family Band, whose sound I found it best to describe as being a unique hybrid of the Allman Brothers' roots-based  rock and Graham Central Station's sanctified funk. On this, their first studio-conceived album, nearly all the tracks shine from the infectiously \"gospel-delic\" groove laid down by the band as well as the industrial strength of Randolph's pedal steel work (which is a joy to behold in itself). I would've given this a 5-star rating if some of the jams were extended for greater effect, but that's just a minor complaint linked mainly to personal preference. On the other hand, I do know a good band when I hear one and something tells me that Robert Randolph & Co. aren't that far off from becoming one of the most exciting and influential bands of their generation (MY generation to be specific).\n\nHIGHLY recommended, but also get their live album as well.

{"text":"Cool!  An entire album of prevously unreleased live Johnny Cash goodies from his commercial heyday in 1969, repeating the success of his earlier concert albums, but here performing for the city slickers in the Big Apple.  Johnny is joined by the reconstituted Carter Family, brother Tommy Cash, the Statler Brothers (who he was a patron of...)  and fellow Sun Records veteran Carl Perkins (as we hear on a  track intro at the very end of the album, June Carter Cash wasn't able to attend as she was six months pregnant at the time...)  It's an efficient, professional  presentation, yet one that gives some nice glimpses into Cash's inner life, mostly through the spoken introductions that accompany many of the songs.  The most telling is the intro to \"Last Night I Had The Strangest Dream,\" in which Cash addresses the thorny issue of the Vietnam War.  Stumbling nervously, hoping not to offend anyone one way or the other, Cash recalls how he and his show went to entertain the troops overseas, declaring, \"I may not be a hawk... But maybe I'm a dove with claws...\"  He also introduces a few songs with asides about his down-home background; back then, these monologes may have been a bit hokey, but they've added resonance as Cash has gotten older and his legend increased.  Also of interest is an angry, emotional reading of his Native American rights protest song, \"As Long As Grass Shall Grow,\" which is one of the most powerful performances of Cash's career.  There are also plenty of religious tunes, which he also puts his heart into.  There are some rushed moments, but on the whole, this is an album well worth checking out, and certainly a delight for longtime Cash fans who have never heard this material before.","classification":5,"fold":0}

And now we've got Educated Horses, not remarkably different from The Sinister Urge or Hellbilly Deluxe - maybe some. It's just another dark - yet fun at the time - rock n' roll album Zombie Style. He sticks to musical and lyrical formulas, not switching up enough to alienate long-time fans, nor does the album sound exactly like the others. After all, on this one, he keeps mentioning Educated Horses on different songs.

{"text":"Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova return with The Swell Season 2.0 and there's no let down. At first listen, there's nothing as instantly catchy as the tunes from \"Once\" and their debut album. If you consider the fact that the tunes from those albums represent some of the finest highlights of Glen Hansard's career with The Frames, it's completely understandable. Even if their romantic relationship didn't survive staring at fame in the face, their creative muse did. They seem to have drawn on the end of their romance and the beginning of a different kind of friendship to craft the gentle sadness and cautious optimism that runs through this album. The lion's share of the credit still goes to Hansard but he makes good use of Irglova who's a stellar musician still developing her skills as a vocalist and songwriter. If you consider her age, she should be absolutely devastating as she gains experience. That doesn't even take into account that she was born to harmonize with Glen. Their voices were absolutely made for each other. Grab the deluxe edition and you've got a full length concert and dvd where Glen's skills as a front man are absolutely dazzling. I've heard some of the between song patter before and I'm not even tired of the storytelling yet.","classification":5,"fold":0}

The latter song is actually not so bad in a happy, hippy-ish kind of way but compared to their old stuff like \"Drops Of Jupiter\" it seriously pales in comparison.\n\n\"Ordinary\" is a very awesome song about life through Spiderman's eyes basically.

{"text":"The ever ambitious Brandon Flowers takes the time that The Killers are on break from making music to...make music. \"Flamingo,\" like the Springsteen influenced \"Sam's Town,\" is another ode to Las Vegas, except this time, Flowers decides to run stylistically amok. Surprisingly enough, it works. I've come to enjoy \"Flamingo\" more than I did The Killers' \"Day and Age.\"\n\nOnce again, Flowers is feeling is inner Bruce, but it seems more tempered this time. The duet with Jenny Lewis on \"Hard Enough\" has a softer core than most of The Killers' best songs yet rates right up there with the band for emotional impact. I suspect producer Daniel Lanois' touch in the more atmospheric sound, as Flowers allows the songs to breathe on their own. Not that Flowers resists the urge to rock; both \"Crossfire\" and \"Was It Something I Said\" could easily have been Killers songs.\n\nWhat one can hope for from \"Flamingo\" is that maybe some of what Flowers has picked up will rub off on his regular band; I'd love to hear them take on the slow-burn build-up of a song like \"Jilted Lovers and Broken Hearts.\" Or maybe see if The Killers could take on something as tempered as \"Playing With Fire.\" A pleasant surprise overall, \"Flamingo\" reinforces the notion that Flowers is a serious talent with ambition to burn.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"I have to say like most Chicago fans that I am happy that hey have released a studio album with new material cause it was long overdue, but I have listened critically to this album numerous times and my first impression was right. Now this is not a comparison about old 70's chicago versus current chicago cause that is a matter of taste, but for the format that they were going for this album it did not work smoothly. If you are into the more ballad oriented Chicago, you might want to check this out, but I was dissapointed. There are some beautiful melodies sung with Jason Scheff and the writing material is not bad on this album, but I would have liked to see more imput writing wise from Bill Champlin and Robert Lamm since Scheff had the most input with seven songs.  There was too many ballads in the beginning of the cd.  I felt some more Chicago presence from track 7 and on, but not that much.  I did not like the producer on this album.  Chicago allowed over a dozen other musicians to play keyboards, drums, guitar, vocals etc that I felt cheated. I did not know who played on what track.  My biggest beef with this album is the way it was produced.  It had Pro Tools(digital recording tool)written all over and it was obvious.  I don't care that they are recording digital cause that is the norm, but it was way over the top!  The lead & back vocals(not to mention the brass)went through some kind of pitch correcting machine that is made the whole album plastic in the department of soul deliverance.  The back vocals on the song \"Caroline\" sounded like a straight keyboard sample.  Why do the these great singers Of Chicago have to go though that pop-machine?  They sounded like those country pop boy bands that have these pristine vocals and it's painfully obvious.  I do not mind effects on the voice but I still want to hear the human essence of a person's voice.  Not some voice pitch corrector that was invented for most millinium pop artists who could not sing to begin with.  These veterans have honed their craft so much that they should be proud to avoid such gadgets.  I do not mind the loops, midi, sequencing, samples etc, cause chicago was always in the forefront of using technology in the days of producer Foster, and not to mention Chicago 18 when the drummer programmed all of his playing into a drum machine, but this album is so overly produced that they would have to counter the next Chicago 31 with some organic sounds to balance for what they allowed.","classification":2,"fold":0}

{"text":"The 90s backlash has been ugly, with this not only 90s classic, but music classic being pushed aside since radio chewed it up and spit it back out, 1,000 spins later. It still lives on in the minds of millions of fans who still put this high up on their life's soundtrack.\n\nIt's a song that runs on a million trains of thoughts, ranging from karma, to self-appreciation, to celebrity-bashing. It's certainly ground-breakingly awesome, bringing awesomeness to another level not only in the world of pop rock, but music period. Hearkening back to those piano-driven pop ballads of the 70s, this outwardly simple song holds a lot of complexity to it. Just ask U2 guitarist\/song-writer \"The Edge.\" When asked in Time Magazine back in '06 what songs he would most like to have written, there was \"Wonderwall,\" and \"You Get What You Give.\" And even though some would say it's a throwback to years gone by, it keeps itself a modern eye, staying relevant not only in the 90s, but also in the 00s.\n\nThen you gotta love those vocals, using the false, and they're just so perfect for the song. And again, it's a throwback to the 70s. As for the last few verses, although some outlets have cut them, I don't really care about them, and they kind box the song in the 90s a little bit too much. Although the way he sings it is great, it's kind of here nor there, didn't need that.\n\nSo looking at best 90s songs, this ranks in the top 10, which is pretty impressive considering the litnia of the decade. Once the brutal 90s backlash is over this song and ones like it will once again receive the credit they deserve, but until then, \"You Get What You Give\" will play on as the soundtrack for a moment in time, forever frozen in splendor.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Last year's American Idol winner, Jordin Sparks, really hasn't hit the nail on the head with great songs on her debut. While her debut single Tattoo was a fair song, it just hasn't shown that she has stood out well to compete with greats like Alicia Keys or newcomer Chrisette Michele. Her second single from that album, No Air with rising Hip Hop star Chris Brown, doesn't work well either. While the song has a fairly nice beat, it just doesn't seem to be an everlasting song that stands out. On top of that, the duet doesn't actually show that there is complete chemistry like other classics. I just honestly think she has a good talent, but needs to find better footing for the long run. Her next single needs to do a much better job at sealing the deal.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":0}

{"text":"The pointblank outpouring of the feminine soul - in a state of anguish & mourning - receives its full measure in this exceptional classic \"Un-break My Heart\"; sung with truly unique voice inflections & intonations by Toni Braxton; composed & written by Diane Eve Warren. We hear our heroine pleading for and commanding her deceased or departed lover to return to her immediately to assauge her loss and hurt, \"Don't leave me in all this pain, Don't leave me out in the rain...\" The use of the imperative is so forceful and direct, it heightens the impact of the song, and renders us as wrung out with catharsis - as she is.\n\nBraxton's soft, silky utterances easily immerse the listener in the strength and power of her heavier vocal chords - when she pours it on, \"Say you'll love me again, Undo this hurt you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life; Un-cry these tears, I cried so many nights...Un-break my heart!\" The excellent video for this song with its dramatic intensity lifts this rendition into being scene- and plot-driven, like \"Mourning Becomes Electra\" with the lights turned down.\n\nThis in turn builds plot and 'grief' motif within 'surround sound' orchestration. Braxton's intensity, her passionate request for her lover to return - becomes one of the more powerful crescendos in pop music. This would not be so - if her lips were sealed - they had to be un-sealed - her depth of expression from deep within her soul - may cause us to grieve (our catharsis, her purge of emotion). We listen to her final refrain and empathize with her loss. It is quite satisfying if not exhausting. We hope to be drenched in her emotional denouement upon re-playing this cinematic song. It is yours to enjoy when the mood is right.\n\n\"Bring back the nights when I held you beside me\nUn-break my heart\nSay you'll love me again\nUndo this hurt you caused\nWhen you walked out the door\nAnd walked out of my life\nUn-cry this tears\nI cried so many, many nights\nUn-break my\nUn-break my heart oh baby\nCome back and say you love me\nUn-break my heart\nSweet darlin'\nWithout you I just can't go on\nCan't go on....\"","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I was looking for a band with more of a Texas or outlaw country sound when I purchased this. They've been mentioned as one of the rising stars in the outlaw country scene, but in my opinion... not really.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a great release, and the songs are solid, especially Every Girl and Whole Damn Town. However... if you're looking for a Ryan Bingham, Waylon Jennings kind of sound, this isn't your album. I liken it more to Okie music (a little more upbeat and lively), less sombre. Of course... they are from Oklahoma, so...\n\nIf you like Trampled by Turles or you're an old fan of the Gin Blossoms, I think you'd like this. The reason I say Gin Blossoms, is because Evan Felker's (lead singer) voice is really similar and the music has that upbeat, mid 90's rock and roll feel (not grunge).","classification":4,"fold":0}

This sketch ranks up their with \"A Christmas Story\" and Ralphie along with his Red Rider BB gun with the Compass in the Stock\/Stalk (who knows???) as being American classics.\n\nThis song is an undying testimony to America's obsessive nature with parody and an unrelenting need to kick back and say \"to hell with being up-tight\" and with good reason - stress is the killer (Fantasia and a white bat or something, anyway...) and life is not all that serious as it is irony based. It doesn't come as a surprise as to why the fine line between becoming productive or postal rests somewhere in letting go for a moment.

{"text":"Hey, in 2009 no one, including this reviewer, NEEDS to comment on the fact that The Rolling Stones, pound for pound, have over forty plus years earned their place as the number one band in the rock `n' roll pantheon. Still, it is interesting to listen once again to the guys when they were at the height of their musical powers (and as high, most of the time, as Georgia pines). This album from the tail end of their most creative period , moreover, unlike let us say Bob Dylan who has produced more creative work for longer, is the `golden era\" of the Stone Age. The album, however, is a little uneven in spots reflecting, I think, a certain exhaustion of material that they could call their totally their own unless the time when they owned a big chunk of rock 'n'roll in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The age of a more sedate music (at least technically) was approaching and I think there was some confusion about whether to embrace it or \"spoof\" it. Still \"Cry Baby\" and \"Memory Motel\" (the stick outs here along with \"Fool To Cry\" make any Stones \"greatest hits\" list. Right?","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"When Tommy James was just 13 years old, he and a group of junior high school buddies formed a rock `n roll band in their hometown of Niles, Michigan. They called themselves The Shondells. The group caught the eye of a local record producer and the Shondells were given a chance to cut a record. The Shondells released a tune called \"Judy\" in 1962. Although that record went nowhere, a local DJ that was starting a new label late in 1963 decided to give The Shondells another shot. They recorded a tune called \"Hanky Panky\" on the fledgling Snap label and this time they had themselves a local hit. However, the record never received any airplay outside the local area. Fast forward now to 1966 when Tommy James received a bizarre phone call from a promoter in Pittsburgh with an urgent request that he come to town to do a live concert. Since Tommy had never even been to Pittsburgh he had no idea what was going on. As it turned out, this promoter had found a copy of \"Hanky Panky\" in a used record bin. He liked it so much that he began playing it at dances all around town. Suddenly, radio stations in Pittsburgh were getting requests for this tune. Tommy James packed his bags and headed for the Steel City. The original Shondells had broken up so if was going to do concerts he would need a band to back him up. He hired a local Pittsburgh outfit called the Reconteurs to fill the bill and Tommy James and the Shondells were born. Soon thereafter the group signed with Morris Levy's Roulette records and re-recorded \"Hanky Panky\". This new recording was a bit more uptempo than the original and was an immediate smash. \"Hanky Panky\" would climb all the way to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart and would remain there for two weeks. Tommy James and the Shondells were on their way.  Though this was never one of my favorite Tommy James songs the story behind the story is pretty interesting.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"The one very noticeable feature of \"XXX\" is that Chicago seem frozen in time. To me, their last album was \"Twenty One\" back in 1991. \"XXX\" could easily be the follow up judging by the musical direction the band takes here. I'd say this album is most identical to Chicago 16 through 21. It has the streamlined, by the book, paint by numbers, manufactured syrupy saccharine assembly line power ballads and lite funk\/jazz pieces you'd expect from 1980's era Chicago. What happened? It's as if the boys missed grunge\/rap\/hip-hop\/hip-pop and have released an extremely American Idol friendly album.\n\nThat being said, the 12 songs are fairly homogenous and melodic. I don't hear any hits here because all the songs sound like they could be made by any MOR\/AOR band right now. The guest musicians don't really add anything original to the Chicago sound. The horns seem more present with less keyboards. There isn't a truly awful song on \"XXX\", but it's just bland and banal pop, and nothing that could match Chicago 16-19. I don't believe \"XXX\" has anything that really resembles their 1970's output, which is a shame, because there are still fans waiting for Chicago to really kick out the jams like they used to and sideline this David Foster-cursed pop they've been producing for the past 24 years.\n\nI also felt it a waste of space to have two versions of their first single \"Feel\". I listened to both and there wasn't any major difference between the two, so I'd go with the \"Hot Single Mix\" version.\n\nIt just seems to me that after nearly 40 years Chicago should be taking more chances with their music. They have absolutely nothing to lose at this point.","classification":3,"fold":0}

It is one of his better songs from Invincible that still stands tall. While it isn't as good as his ballads were like Man In The Mirror or Lady In My Life. Still, it holds up well into why he will always be The King Of Pop. He knew what he wanted in song and heart.

James Taylor has to be one of the naturals.\nOf course, if you want perfection, you probably want to stick with the studio recordings.  But if you want to hear a truly electric performance, go with this live album.\nFrom the first cut, \"Sweet Baby James\", you can sense the perfect rapport with the audience.  The live version of \"Mexico\" is quite enhanced by the life atmosphere, and by the time you get to \"Fire and Rain\", you can sense a flow between the singer and his audience.  The energy reaches its zenith on \"Shower The People\" and \"How Sweet It Is\".\nCut after cut is notable here.  The pure country sound of \"She Thinks I Still Care\" is a highlight.  \"You've Got A Friend\" and \"That Lonesome Road\" close a truly exciting experience.  If you prefer the best in the spontanaity of a live performance to the cool and perfect studio recording, or even if the two are equal in your mind, then you deserve to have this in your collection.","classification":5,"fold":0}

I own all of Toro Y Moi's other albums and appreciate them for what they are and consider Anything in Return a worthy addition to his discography.

{"text":"Collective Soul remains the most reliable band in rock. Ed Roland has a formula, and he's stuck with it for many years. Particularly since 2004's \"Youth,\" it seems the band has made essentially the same album four times, with a few different flavors and variations to shake things up. And, incredibly, it's worked, resulting in a consistency of quality music found nowhere else that I know of. They're a band out of time, still relying on big, sometimes lumbering riffs and hooks, big choruses with \"ooh-ooh-oohs,\" soaring harmonies, and a punchy loud-quiet-loud guitar-rock sensibility that defies whatever trend may be big in a given year.\n\nThis time out, they've taken the sound of their last three albums and brought back some of the feel for their eponymous second album. A touch of piano and strings add some much needed depth to a few of the songs, while the other songs totally take care of business to satisfy longtime fans of Collective Soul's hard rock plus big chorus sound.\n\nThe only drawback on the album is how the lyrics can sometimes be very predictable. When Roland sings the first half of a couplet, one can often anticipate exactly what the second half will be even on the first listen. Musically, the band has always had an approach that says \"a place for everything and everything in its place,\" layering each piece and constructing an arrangement, and it seems that the lyrics at times do that, too. In the long run, it's not a big problem for me, but it's noticeable.\n\nUltimately, I think this will satisfy longtime fans but won't win over a new generation. And I don't think that's their goal. I think this band has seen superstardom and knows that they are now part of the old guard with a great fan base and an opportunity to keep making the music they (and we) love. They're taking that opportunity, and this album is the latest entry in what has steadily become one of the strongest catalogs of any of the bands that emerged in the '90s alt-rock boom. Good for them, and good for us.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Previous reviewers have already covered the obvious merits of this live performance and broadly agree except perhaps regarding the extent to which the NYPO plays accurately. I have to say that apart from a few minor burbles from the trumpet and horns which remain perfectly acceptable in a live, I am amazed by the unanimity of their drive and attack; Mitropoulos galvanises them into giving a truly ferocious account of the stretti passages in the first and final movements and they are very sharp in following both the conductor's beat and the frequent switches in rhythm and time signatures characteristic of Mahler's scores. It is clear that Bernstein by no means had it all to do in familiarising this orchestra with Mahler in the sixties; his mentor had obviously already rained and enthused them.\n\nThe only reason to regret the slightly raw and quite resonant mono sound is in the huge, tutti climaxes of the finale, when Mitropoulos generates an extraordinarily glorious cacaphony as the titanic struggle between optimism and despair unfolds; otherwise the acoustic, by accentuating the typically strident whistle of the violins when they are playing high up on the bridge, if anything, adds to the excitement. However, Mitropoulos knows when to let the music swoon and sigh and again prompts me to wonder just how influential he was in informing Bernstein's own style in Mahler.\n\nThere is some radio whistle a few minutes into that finale and the audience are a bit restive up top that point, too, but both irritations pass and Mitropoulos keeps the screws on to the bitter end - and indeed it is, deeply dark and forlorn.\n\nI have an entirely irrelevant and personal reason for favouring this recording; it happens to have been made on the same Easter Sunday over sixty years ago when I first saw the light of day...","classification":5,"fold":0}
{"text":"When Seattle-based rappper, Macklemore, scored his first big hit, \"Thrift Shop\", earlier in the year, I thought it was a very gimmicky song.  I thought the comical lyrics and the use of the little kid's voice were just attempts to draw attention away from Macklemore's rapping, which I felt was uninspired.  However, with repeated, listenings, it has grown on me a little bit.\n\nMacklemore's follow-up, \"Can't Hold Us\" (featuring Ray Dalton), is a whole different story.  This song hits strong and hard right from the start.  It kicks off with the easy, but impressive, vocals of Ray Dalton, whose voice is a perfect compliment to Macklemore's raps.  Macklemore, himself, seems a lot more energized throughout the entire song.  Then, there is the music, which cleverly avoids some of the cliched traps of other pop hits.  Its use of horns in the bridge is entirely fitting, instead of artificial, and the beat stays quick throughout.\n\nI'd like to see Dalton and Macklemore team up some more.","classification":4,"fold":0}

Definately my favorite of the new songs. Lorrie does a remake of \"Another Lonely Song\"  which shows off Lorrie's traditional country voice, a tribute to Tammy Wynette, as only Lorrie could cover a song by the late country diva. \"If I Cry\" is another emotional ballad that will leave you breathless, she sings with so much passion and emotion. \"Whoop-De-Do\" is an upbeat song, a bit of a departure from her usual music, but its fun and you can tell she enjoyed doing it. \"Angel\" is Lorrie's cover of the Sarah McLaughlin hit, she does it just as well, this one is a live track that will make you want to cry.\nThe hits on this album are We Both Walk, Half Enough, By My Side (with Jon Randall), Good As I Was To You, Go Away, One Of Those Nights Tonight, Maybe Not Tonight (with Sammy Kershaw), I Guess I Had to Be There, Trainwreck of Emotion, Standing Tall, He Talks to Me and the classic Something in Red.

{"text":"Shovels & Rope is a husband-and-wife duo from South Carolina, consisting of Michael Trent and Cary Ann Hearst, who bring a nice mix of country-folk-Americana. If you are not familiar with their sound, I'd say that The Civil Wars is a good reference point. in 2012 they released their debut album \" O' Be Joyful\" and now comes the duo's next studio album.\n\n\"Swimmin' Time\" (13 tracks; 54 min.) kicks off with \"The Devil Is All Around\" and it is immediately clear that the new album is very much in line with the debut album. The production sounds like it's a bit richer. \"Evil\" sounds a bit heavier. One of THE highlights on the album is the epic 6+ min. \"After The Storm\". The album's title track features glorious vocal interplay between Michael and Carey Ann. I was initially surprised to see a track called \"Ohio\" on here, thinking it might be a cover of that other Americana-leaning band, Over the Rhine. But no, it is an original tune from Shovels & Rope, and in fact sounds very different than OtR's \"Ohio\". \"Mary Ann & One Eyed Dan\" is an upbeat, romantic tune that lightens the mood nicely. We round out the album with another epic song, \"Tresher\". In all, this is quite the album, and this confirms the great talents that are Shovels & Rope.\n\nAs an avid listener of NPR's Morning Edition, I was surprised but very happy to hear a long piece on\/interview with Michael and Carey Ann on today's show as I was driving in to work. They sure deserve the attention. Can't wait to see them in concert at some point. With the final demise of The Civil Wars, I wouldn't be surprised if Shovels & Rope get more widespread recognition. Meanwhile, \"Swimmin' Time\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"George Benson's Breezin' was a landmark album in jazz music.  It introduced a style of jazz that was inflected with r&b stylings that made it appealing to a mass audience who necessarily didn't like the genre.  The album hit number one on the Top 200 & r&b charts and stayed at number one on the jazz charts for over a year.  The album was spurred on by Mr. Benson's smooth and elegant cover of \"This Masquerade\" which peaked at number 10 and went on to win the 1976 Grammy for Record of the Year.  But in addition to that great track, the album had five other gems including the appropriately titled title track which has a light, airy Latin vibe, the straight jazz of \"Six To Four\" and the sophistication of \"Lady\".  The remastered version contains three additional tracks including a great song, \"Shark Bite\" and the single edit of \"This Masquerade\" which palls in comparison to the full length version.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"2014 has been a creative year for Mary J Blige.  Just to be clear, Ive been a casual Mary fan since \"You Remind Me\" premiered on BET 22 years ago.  I loved her first three albums and then I veered away from her as she started delving into more adult R&B.  I came back when \"Growing Pains\" was released and enjoyed that album fully and then again really didn't get into her releases afterwards as much.\nEarlier this year, I heard the \"Think Like A Man\" soundtrack and just about loved every track that Mary did....think fresher newer R&B along with discoey r&b.  If you haven't heard it, then please check that album out.  The promotion for that album sucked and the singles chosen made no sense.\nNow for the London Sessions, Mary's worked with some serious british hit-makers to put out her most ground-breaking work to date all while staying true to that core Mary sound.  The ballads are all up there with \"Not Gon' Cry\" \"Sweet Thing\" yet sound crisp and fresh and emotional and I just really cant stop listening to them.  Not loving you, Doubt and Whole damn year are my absolute faves from the ballad side.  Then we have the house side which reminds me of 90's sounds from Nightcrawlers, Robin S, etc.  My absolute favorite track on the album is the stunning house epic, \"My Loving.\" The delivery is stunning, the emotion, the beat, the tweaked background vocals, all stunning.\n\nPlease don't mess up the promo for this album.  While i love \"Therapy,\"  did not agree that it should be the song she should have performed at the AMA's.  Mary - perform \"My Loving\" \"Doubt\" \"Whole Damn Year\" or \"Not Loving You\" at the next awards show.  Those tracks need to be heard by the masses.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Frankly, I expected nothing like this cd. Actually, I didn't know what to expect after \"Believe\". I was on of those that had a \"wee\" problem with Cher going 'dance'. I wanted another \"Heart Of Stone\" or \"It's A Man's World. Believe showed Cher in great vocal form from previous recordings. The songs suited her to a tee (with the exception of \"We All Sleep Alone\", a real nightmare!) and the production was quite good.\nMy big surprise was the amount of careful work that went into this followup. The only reason this cd doesn't rate a \"5\" in my opinion is that she could have done it entirely without vocoder effects and it would have still been great. After all, I buy her music to hear HER.\n\"Song For The Lonely\" will be as big, if not bigger, than Believe. And there are several potentials for Top 10 to follow. Check out the infectious \"Different Kind Of Love Song\", the haunting \"Rain Rain\", anthemic \"Alive Again\", the 70's  disco \"Love Is A Lonely Place Without You\", and a great cover of \"Love One Another\". This cd tops Believe without taking away from it. If you haven't got it yet, wait for the february release of the US version which will contain an additional track (13).

{"text":"I would've definitely prepared the idea for Carrie Underwood to record this song on her own.\n\nWhen I first heard this song on the radio, I was totally dying for this song just to be a promotional single. Actually, I was also thinking \"You have totally GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. THIS is ACTUALLY a song?\". The fact that THIS SONG is becoming huge right now is totally shocking and intolerable. I am completely repulsed. I can't believe that this song is something associated with Carrie Underwood, because as far as I'm concerned, she is just about the only thing that is a pro about this song. Why? Does Carrie Underwood have a sassy, whiny, and bratty voice? NO!!! But Miranda Lambert definitely does in this song, and I'm 100% sure that she has been even worse than this.\n\nWhy can't people realize that songs like this are not important to country music and turn to something from Sara Evans or Cassadee Pope instead? Even when good female singers are trying to make themselves useful and make songs that actually mean something, which are also songs that define importance, those female artists just get carelessly and recklessly tossed in the gutty water by untalented and uninspired female artists like Miranda Lambert. It's just saddening, depriving, heartbreaking, and disgustingly inexcusably WRONG!!! Listen, there are better songs out there. Pay no attention to this crap that deserves to be flushed down the toilet the second you learn about it. You SHOULD venture Sara Evans for music that actually means something.","classification":1,"fold":0}

On this tune The Ronettes weaved their best magic and it catapulted the group to the top.\n\nThe lead singer, Veronica Bennett, married Phil Spector and changed her name to Ronnie Spector--and wow, does she handle the lead vocals on this tune like a pro! Backup singers Estelle Bennett (Veronica's sister) and their cousin Nedra Talley do the perfect job of supporting Ronnie. \"Be My Baby\" is also notable for being the very first song on which Cher sang vocals; Cher did extra backup the day this was recorded when someone didn't show up! All together, these ladies never miss a note or fail to harmonize flawlessly.\n\nThis excellent tune is a must have for just about any collection of music by The Ronettes, 1960s girl groups and even pop; others will appreciate their R&B styled music.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I have long thought of the Bangles as a second tier band, sort of the ugly stepsisters to the more enjoyable GoGo's, and nowhere near in the same league as the Cinderella of all groups, Fanny (still the premiere all-female band). I've always liked the group, I just wasn't moved by them. Too much of the time they seemed like four individuals fighting for the solo spotlight, versus a tight, together unit. Well, all that has changed with DOLL REVOLUTION, the new release from 2003's Most Improved act. Tight, cohesive and intelligent, this is a group to be reckoned with. This is clear right from the start; the disc opens with a blistering cover of Elvis Costello's \"Tear Off Your Own Head.\" Susanna Hoff's opening \"HEY!\" only hints at things to come in the rest of the song...hand claps, a pounding rhythm section, tinkling piano and soaring vocals coalesce, resulting in one of the Bangles' best, hardest rocking songs to date. \"Stealing Rosemary\" has a rockin', neo-folk vibe to it, while \"Something That You Said\" has a delicate (yet fresh) techno groove behind it's hushed vocals and tender lyrics. This touching song of true love (\"Showing you every weakness and feeling strong for it\/I used to run from real love now I long for it\/Now I know what I've been missing\/Since I've been listening\") features an assured lead vocal from Hoffs, probably her best to date. The same could be said about Debbi Peterson and her aching take on \"Ask Me No Questions.\" Gorgeous harmonies round out this beauty. \"The Rain Song\" has to be one of my favorite tracks. A mid-tempo rocker, it sports a gutsy lead vocal from guitarist Vicki Peterson and smart lyrics (\"I don't think about us much anymore\/Frankly the topic has become a bore\" and \"I don't think about us when I'm sleeping\/It doesn't even cross my dreamlike mind\/And I don't think I see your face through the curtains\/Hell, I don't even miss you half the time\"). This is an AC hit waiting to happen! Bassist Michael Steele steps into the spotlight and shines on her groovy \"Nickel Romeo.\" This cut is a great example of how much the group has grown into a more unified musical unit. \"Ride The Ride\" is a rollicking group effort, while \"I Will Take Care Of You\" is another gentle Hoffs number. \"Here Right Now\" is a real gem that slowly grew on me. Drummer Debbi Peterson was always kind of \"the kid sister who has to be in the band\" to me, sort of a female Ringo, but she has SO come into her own on DOLL REVOLUTION, both as a vocalist and lyricist (\"In and outta town\/Time for you to settle down\/Stand back, take a look around you\/You're runnin' from the pressures of the restless world\/Hush for a moment, baby just be still\"). Captivating....simply captivating! From here we segue into another favorite, Vicki Peterson's hauntingly dark \"Single By Choice.\" With it's opening chorus (\"Single by choice\/Never married, never ever divorced\/Listen to the solitary voice\/Tell you I'm single by choice\"), one might think there's a bitterness to the song, but nothing could be farther from the truth...as you get deeper into the track, you see there's an intelligence and life-experience to it that's missing from much of today's music (\"I know what you're thinkin'\/She can't be complete\/Til the right kind of man\/Comes sweep her off her feet\/Well I've been there before\/Times four, times five\/With the right kind of man\/Barely made it out alive\"). Brava, Ms. Peterson (kind of ironic, though, that Vicki just got engaged)! \"Lost At Sea\" is another winner from Peterson's baby sister...Debbi once again shines on this heartfelt ballad that builds and soars, with spot-on lyrics that everyone can identify with (\"Can we try to salvage what we can\/From the weight of water and sand\/Lift us up again\", \"Well,you walk\/Never ever looking back\/One defends and one attacks\/There's a thousand reasons to begin again\"). \"Song For A Good Son\" is a great story-song from Steele. Intense and propulsive, the lyrics are stunningly visual - sort of a mini movie! - and Michael delivers them with conviction and in a strong, authoritative vocal. \"Mixed Messages\" and \"Between The Two\" are probably my two least favorite tracks on DOLL REVOLUTION, not because they're bad, just because everything else is so strong. \"Mixed Messages\" has a nice enough 60's feel to it, while \"Between The Two\" has a soaring (albeit slightly forced) intensity. The disc closes with the gorgeous \"Grateful.\" Be it an ode to her children or a musical thank-you to her fellow band members for a successful second chance together, the song is delivered from Hoffs' heart and gut. Floating out of your speakers, it makes you thankful for unexpected opportunities and small surprises. Much the same could be said about DOLL REVOLUTION!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Although Van Morrison's finest duet contribution this year is, in my opinion, on Buddy Guy's Grammy-nominated \"Born to Play Guitar\" album - \"Flesh & Bone,\" an original tribute to the late B.B. King - this is a brilliantly produced (mostly by Morrison, who also plays either guitar or alto sax on half of the 16 tracks) and performed album of the highest quality.  Unlike so many perfunctory duets projects, which may only include a couple of noteworthy or halfway memorable collaborations, this one was carefully designed to elicit a superior level of musical virtuosity and soul from start to finish, drawing from Morrison's stunningly prolific oeuvre (here, extending from 1970 to 2012 - from \"His Band and the Street Choir\" to \"Born to Sing: No Plan B\").  His duet partners were clearly chosen strictly for their remarkable abilities to enhance each selection, as opposed to commercial considerations.\n\nBecause of the consistency of quality, it is not so easy to single out favorites without having to mention nearly every track.  But I feel compelled to start at the beginning with Trk 1, \"Some Peace of Mind\" from \"Hymns to the Silence\" (1991), featuring the late Bobby Womack, the fellow Rock & Roll Hall of Famer and top ten male soul artist of the 1970s, in his final recorded performance.  Co-produced by Morrison and Don Was, this represents a major moment in soul in this century.  Skipping to the closing track \"How Can a Poor Boy?\" from \"Keep It Simple\" (2008), we have the top blues performance of the set - sizzling and ultimately ferocious - with the formidable Taj Mahal.  This is an intense six-and-a-half-minute blues workout, with a well-deserved release at the end as they crack each other up.  (This is illustrative of the tremendous rapport Morrison has with his collaborators.  There is no \"phoning it in\" here.)\n\nAnd how about \"Whatever Happened to P.J. Proby?\" from \"Down the Road\" (2002), also co-produced by Don Was, and featuring none other than P.J. Proby himself!  This is a real soul-jazz vocal treat with echoes of the Chicago great Oscar Brown, Jr. from the '60s.\n\nStaying with soul-jazz, the duet with George Benson is really special because we also get to hear Benson's ultra-cool electric guitar.  The song is \"Higher Than the World\" from \"Inarticulate Speech of the Heart\" (1983) and sounds like it could have been a colossal hit from that time period.  Also doing double duty on guitar and as a vocal collaborator is the fantastic Mark Knopfler on \"Irish Heartbeat,\" from both \"Inarticulate Speech of the Heart\" and the 1988 Van Morrison collaboration with The Chieftains on the \"Irish Heartbeat\" album.\n\nFor notable duets with female artists, there are \"Wild Honey,\" from \"Common One\" 1980), a stunning one done in '70s Philly soul style with Joss Stone, and featuring excellent tenor sax work by Chris White; \"If I Needed Someone\" from \"His Band and the Street Choir\" with the phenomenally soulful Mavis Staples; \"These Are the Days,\" from \"Avalon Sunset\" (1989), with Natalie Cole in maybe her second greatest duet ever (after \"Unforgettable\" with her late father); \"Carrying a Torch,\" from \"Hymns to the Silence\" with the brilliant British chanteuse Clare Teal; and \"Rough God Goes Riding\" (from the 1997 single) with his daughter Shana Morrison, a major vocal artist in her own right.  (The last four mentioned were all co-produced with Don Was.)\n\n\"Streets of Arklow,\" from \"Veedon Fleece\" (1974), teams two of the all-time \"blue-eyed\" British soul-singing greats in Morrison and Mick Hucknall and is another Don Was co-production.  It is hauntingly beautiful, with a stunning electric guitar solo  by Dave Keary.  Michael Bubl rather unpredictably appears on the spirited rocker \"Real Real Gone,\" from \"Enlightenment\" (1990), and sings in an eerily accurate Van Morrison intonation.  Red-hot vocal jazz star Gregory Porter appears on the paean to the classic old-time jazz and blues of Kansas City, \"The Eternal Kansas City,\" from \"A Period of Transition\" (1977).  British soul-rocker Chris Farlowe, who goes back to 1966 as a hit-maker (and later, the vocalist for Colosseum), appears on the late-'50s-New Orleans-R&B-sounding \"Born to Sing,\" the most recently-composed song here (from just three years ago).\n\nI like \"Get On with the Show,\" from \"What's Wrong with This Picture\" (2003), which rocks an early-'60s Brill Building Ben E. King sound, but this is one in which duet guest Georgie Fame, another British star from the '60s, seems to be underused.  He is overpowered vocally and does not get to shine on the organ as he did guesting with Diana Krall on his 1964 dbut hit \"Yeh Yeh\" earlier this year.  Still, the only track I would fall short of fully endorsing is \"Fire in the Belly,\" from \"The Healing Game\" (1997) with Steve Winwood.  I think Morrison erred by allowing this track to run 6:40, and it definitely drags at this length (so unlike the aforementioned \"How Can a Poor Boy?\" - with Taj Mahal - which just kept increasing in intensity, thus meriting such a duration).\n\nSo what we have here is one of the finest all-duets albums you'll ever hear, with some stellar moments for the ages.","classification":5,"fold":0}
{"text":"Irresistible by Fall Out Boy feat. Demi Lovato is a song that initially appears to be about  being romantically attracted to someone even if they are technically hard on your heart (at least that is what Im guessing from the lyrics I love the way you hurt me). However, the youtube video changes up the meaning of the song a little bit, because the group generously shares how the music video shows dolls who come to life that are inspired by one of NSyncs music videos (Nsync member Joey Fatone even makes an appearance in the video for Irresistible by Fall Out Boy feat. Demi Lovato).","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"\"Believe\" as everyone knows was a worldwide smash single, here in the uk i very much enjoyed seeing it at the no. 1 spot for 7 weeks and found out yesterday on tv it was the 5th best selling song of the 90's in the uk. Believe is a good album, the following track \"the power\" takes cher almost in another direction with a feel of eastern music added to a slow thump of a beat which worked very well.\n\n\"Runaway\" was probably the main song i would say could have been released which has a very groovy darkness about it with a very modern fast basey beat and suits chers vocals very well.\n\nThe following 2 songs \"all or nothing\" and \"strong enough\" are typical cher songs, just with pop beats instead of power rock music. Unfortunately after the 5th song things start taking a little bit of a dive - \"dov'e l'amore\" doesnt sit right on this album and sounds too latino, the Emilio Estefan Junior Remix of the song would have sounded better and that was released in the uk. \"taking back my heart\" is ok but not alot to it.\n\nAfter this i think targeting a younger audience was taken to the extreme \"taxi taxi\" and \"love is the groove\" are very badly wrote, cher does her best but it only just manages a level for 10 year olds to enjoy. Finally we get a remix and not a re-recording of \"we all sleep alone\". A little disapointing that there were only 9 new tracks of which 5 were excellent and the others quite the opposite. I gave it 4 stars as the first few deserved 5 stars, usually if i buy an album with 5 tracks on it i really like then thats enough for me to be pretty happy!","classification":4,"fold":0}

But there was another group on the scene that somehow managed to crank it up yet another notch. Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels exploded onto the scene in late 1965 and over the next 18 months had a fabulous run of raucous, driving hit records that included \"Jenny Take A Ride\", \"Sock It To Me Baby\" and a driving remake of Bill Medley's \"Little Latin Lupe Lu\". The granddaddy of them all however was the group's 1966 hit \"Devil With A Blue Dress On & Good Golly Miss Molly\".

{"text":"1973, the Philly wonder group Stylistics release their third album after the first 2 albums, 2 straight classics.  Thom Bell and Linda Creed make a great production team, and Russel Thompkins Jr. keeps hitting the high notes as the lead tenor.  The music is lush again like the second album Round 2, and there are some surefire winners here.  \"Make It Last\" has the same lushness of songs like \"You'll Never Get To Heaven (If You Break My Heart)\" from Round 2.  \"Payback Is A Dog\" is about how a woman who does wrong will finally know how it feels when she is on the receiving side of the heartbreak, and has impeccable harmony.  \"Love Comes Easy\" has that smooth lush feel again and deals with finding one great thing in life in an uneasy world: love.  \"Rockin' Roll Baby\" has a vintage 70's rock feel with the great falsetto lead (giving it a soul inflection), and a light touch of funk.  Not my fav, but it shows that the Stylistics can expand into different territory effectively.  A persistent sentiment of love even if unrequited is expressed in the nice mid-tempo \"I Won't Give You Up.\"  Then we have a great jam with the slower \"Let Them Work It Out,\" which is more laidback and deals with a certain friend who gossips about other friends' love lives (and troubles in said romances), and that it is getting annoying.  The song is about letting couples work through their difficulties.  A somber joint is \"Could This Be The End.\"  It is another slower joint with perfect harmony.  Rockin' Roll Baby is another classic in the Stylistics catalogue.  Thom Bell is a genius musician, especially considering his classic works with The Delfonics, The Stylistics, The Spinners, among others.  The Stylistics are right next to the Delfonics as 2 of my favorite soul groups ever.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Iris' new CD is the gift that keeps on giving.  These are songs that seep under your skin and make the goosebumps rise when she takes your emotions like a new recruit and then sets sail on her musical waters riding the waves through storm and through calm.  The title track \"Sing the Delta\" is full of longing and the sweetest ache of times gone by, \"Sing the Delta a love song for me; Lay it down on that river; Let it roll on out to sea.\"  The opening track \"Go On Ahead & Go Home\" has a joyous feel with the trill in Iris' vocals giving an extra emotional push, \"Go let your mama see you smile; Your mama's gonna wait however long it takes, but it's sure been awhile.\"  When Iris' \"The Night I Learned How Not to Pray\" came on, I thought Iris was adapting Jeannie C. Riley's old tune \"Harper Valley PTA,\" but that impression soon faded as the lyrical darkness began to seep through.  The track is profound because all of us who have been through these deep personal trials must either lose faith or come to understand that our Heavenly Father is not our errand boy and is concerned more with the eternal than the temporal -- at least that's how it seems to me and what I get from this profound confessional song.

This song is most Sergio singing, yet there is a female singing and together they sing their heart out.\nThis song is fun to listen to and there is a lesson in this song of how to treat the person right the first time around!\n\nGreat song for dancing!","classification":5,"fold":0}
{"text":"I know Bach was a prolific composer, but WOW! Got this for my wife, who loves harpsichord music, and there's more than enough for even the most fanatical fan of this baroque instrument. The recordings were good quality and Mr. Galling is apparently one of the top interpreters of this music form, but too many of these pieces sounded too much alike. Honestly, the first 15 minutes were enough for me, but my wife can listen to it all day and loves it.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"The good old loudness war. After getting Thin Lizzy's classic Chinatown Deluxe Edition, I noticed something. It wasn't mixed to maximum loudness. Yipee! Nirvana's Nevermind however was not so fortunate. To your average kid who solely listens to illegally downloaded MP3's on his ipod, this might sound fine, but not to me. It's just too loud. The music has no pop, nothing jumping at you. Very limited dynamic range. You can see for yourself in the customer images I have posted. Think of it as going to the movies and everything is the same volume. The explosions, the gunfights, etc at the same volume of say, a person speaking. Now that just doesn't make sense now does it? There's no oomph, no pop, nothing to make you jump out of your seat, and that's just what this deluxe edition accomplishes. The extras are actually pretty decent, and the packaging is nice apart from Universal cutting corners and replacing the hard outer plastic box with the DELUXE EDITION logo on it with a band that  wraps around the digipack that you have to cut through to get to the goods, or you just get a plain little stick on it that reads DELUXE EDITION. It looks cool and all, but it doesn't cut it. I strongly suggest sticking to your original CD and come across the extras on your own. Universal does not deserve your cash on this one.\n\nTracklist below.\n\nCD 1\nOriginal album\n1. Smells Like Teen Spirit\n2. In Bloom\n3. Come As You Are\n4. Breed\n5. Lithium\n6. Polly\n7.

{"text":"WOW! was my reaction after listening to this the first time.  I've gotten into a very bad habit of buying cds & putting them on my mp3 player without listening to them first so I never know what to expect of new artists.  However each time one of these tracks played, I found myself smiling because it was so good & also pulling out the player so that I could check for the artist.  Finally I listened to the entire album in one sitting and fell in love with it.\n\nLianne is a singer\/songwriter whose lyrics are way beyond a 22 yr old, her vocal style is unique - smoky, airy and reminiscent of Sade on certain tracks while on others she displays strong, confident more powerful vocals. The album is also well constructed with excellent song placement and enough tempo changes so that I was never bored. I love that she is confident in her own style and didn't chase trends in order to make her music fit in with what's hot right now.  These are the type of songs I'll listen to over & over and will probably reach for this album when I'm a senior citizen because they touched my heart and made me feel something.\n\nHonestly the only 2 songs that I like but don't love are: FORGET & TEASE ME.  The songs that I flipped over and keep pressing the repeat button on are: EVERYTHING EVERYTHING, DON'T WAKE ME UP, ELUSIVE, LOST & FOUND, GONE, NO ROOM FOR DOUBT & THEY COULD BE WRONG.\n\nI hope she gets more chances to perfom in the US so that more people can be introduced to her music.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Oh yeah, if you are looking to have your brain slammed back and forth from one ear to the other ear, this is the one! I have heralded only one track\/song by the Queens as the ultimate new age piece destined to become the fashion of the new generation in 2013 and beyond (actually it came out on the airwaves years earlier) and it is one of the two and only two (so far) pieces they were able to write and play that I really love and enjoy hearing it over and over again so much that I would buy the album. The superior details of my pick as the new age tune of the coming age are;\nfirst the subject which carries a universal message that everything they tell you or feed to you isn't true. There is a mystical truth that no one knows but you can know if you want to. Simple, right? Nothing earth shattering about that, but I find such deeper nuances and openings to a deeper or higher truth in it every time I hear it.\n  Second is the orchestration of the piece, and the organization of my perfect song is wonderful. It begins with string entry on electric guitar, (although I've seen the tall guy banging away on an acoustical guitar in concert) . First thing is a tentative mid range chord swipe followed by a second bold strum using the same chord then blazing away into the chords banged as a rhythm, with varying chords that raise up to the high range and then cut off by a single plucked string that's allowed to fade off for a while a second or two and that leads into the voice singing in a soft tone, suggesting a secret whispered into your ear then raising to a pitch that wails across the table at a bistro you're sitting at with him. As the singer carries on with his performance the harmonizing players join on key notes while the electric guitars jam on at a feverous rate, keeping the same rhythm and beat underneath them swelling when there's a pause in the song, eddying away after he rejoins until without warning  (well, I know where and when by now) it all freezes, stops suddenly and there is only the bass thrum of a string , low and reverberating, steady and carrying the whole band, the world and the secret on it's powerful,confident back. That all too brief sound  is the one I wait for as I fall under its spell and it tells me the secret and the meaning that no one knows. I didn't know what to do about the ending going into a Mexican radio station and the announcer crying \"avey,..avay,..avey,..aiyee...\" but now I do know that the Queens had cradled the entire album around and within leaps into various broadcast stations in order to carry the secret out into the world  and seek a change, I have come to enjoy the brash announcer as another performer doing a job, yet a part of mysteries beyond us. The second song on this album is the Mosquito song, perhaps a dig at music producers and bean counters who would suck the life out of composers and performers? however one that I have come to interpret as music of another creation that is living and composing music in its own way and I avoid judgement on its efforts. For sure the whine of a mosquito gives me chills and snags my interest as I prepare to fend it (her?) away from my flesh, but there's something broadcast-y and remenisent about the sound she makes resembling the whine on a radio being tuned in. As of yet I haven't found a single song I would say I can stand after those two, but the ease,flexibility, quality is above average and excellent.","classification":5,"fold":0}

That won't happen because the song honestly doesn't sound significantly different from a few Britney Spears songs we no longer hear on the radio these days, which is a telling sign if you ask me. Still, what \"Bad Romance\" accomplishes is solid proof that Lady Gaga DOES have some talent. Now whether she continues to take advantage of her talent or not is still up in the air. For now however, enjoy \"Bad Romance\" to at least get some minor satisfaction in a pop song that is undeniably good.  Will it hold up over the years and be remembered though?

He has been sober for a while, his wife is pregnant, he is finally getting the recognition he deserves as a song writer. Instead it seems like this album is Southeastern part 2. Please do not think that this is a horrible album, it is pretty good. I just miss Jason's southern rock guitar slinging songs. This album will go into random rotation and hey it may even grow on me, but I doubt I will ever listen to the whole album as one again. Just to slow and predictable to me. I will def catch him live whenever I have the chance, he puts on a great show. I will also look forward to his next album.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"It has been a very, very long time since we've heard anything new from Alicia Keys. She has had a lot of good songs, but radio started to ignore her from her last album Girl On Fire. While she did have some great songs like Brand New Me, and New Day, which were very strong and soulful from her strong voice, Alicia was still overshadowed from the sever overexposure of artists like Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles. But it still has slowed Alicia down from making great music. In Common is Alicia Keys' first new song in four years and definitely a nice return from the Soulful pianist and songwriter. The song is definitely a very spiritual rhythm that definitely sounds unlike anything Alicia has performed in a long while. It is a really good song, and honestly better than the products that have been overplayed on radio today whom stopped knowing what great music is like. The song reminds me of the Sting's hypnotic song Desert Rose from the late 90's, and showed a side of him that really was electrifying at heart. If you are a die hard Alicia Keys fan, you'll definitely like this song, and it is a good treat for anyone whom is just so tired of the so-called jokes of R&B like Ciara and Rihanna.\n\nSong: B+\n\n5,300th Review On Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"I have been turning more toward solo piano music lately, and this collection is a welcome bargain that features mainly very solid performances.\n\nThe artists are generally excellent performers, but not the most famous names -- with one major exception, as Hungary's Jeno Jando features most prominently in the set, with 29 tracks. I consider him an international A-list pianist -- not that I'm an expert, but Jando is certainly the real deal.\n\nFrench pianist Evelyne Dubourg, who has recorded quite a bit on the Tudor label, is the second most featured artist, on 15 tracks, and performs very well. I also found the playing on the six tracks by Peter Rsel very engaging.\n\nThere are a few problems, however. For one, track No. 7, which is supposed to be the 2nd movement of Edvard Grieg's Piano Concerto Op. 16, is in fact a repeat of track No. 1, the famous bit from Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. (Update: I understand this has now been corrected -- check the samples to make sure.)\n\nThere are also a few technical glitches, like a distracting \"click\" on the fade out on track 11 (Robert Schumann's \"Trumerei\"), at 3:03. Track 69, the 2nd movement of Schubert's Piano Sonata in Am, has some serious noise issues, especially at about 2:40. A little more care in production could have caught mistakes like these.\n\nAlso, it's a shame that on orchestral pieces (excerpts from piano concertos and the like), only the names of the orchestras are listed. It is customary to credit the soloist as well, and not doing so is, well, impolite.\n\nFinally, buyers of previous sets from Cobra Entertainment will face a high repetition rate. I have only purchased two of their sets previously --&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/99-Must-Have-Chillout-Classics\/dp\/B0051QU0M6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">99 Must-Have Chillout Classics<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/99-Must-Have-Mozart-Masterpieces\/dp\/B0051U6XZU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">99 Must-Have Mozart Masterpieces<\/a>&nbsp;-- and already this collection gives me 36 tracks that are outright repeats of performances from those other sets. (The large majority of the repeats are from the \"Chillout\" set.) While I realize that content providers make their living by repackaging and reselling content, this kind of repeat rate after so few purchases appears to bode poorly for the future.\n\nThat all being said, is this set worth the introductory price of $1.99? You betcha, and then some. This is great music and overall, highly recommended. Plenty of \"greatest hits\" that everyone will recognize, but also many well-performed gems that are a little more off the beaten path.

{"text":"Although he has recorded numerous times with his Denver-based acoustic jazz group Perpetual Motion, this is Tom's first release as a solo artist, and in the words of Crosby Stills and Nash: \"it's been a long time coming.\" From the opening notes of the first track, \"In Search Of,\" it is obvious that Tom is an accomplished guitar instrumentalist. His intricate fingering is precise, yet fluid as it moves from one passage to another. I couldn't help but notice, not only in this composition, but characteristic of his playing in general, are the unusual chord changes and progressions he comes up with. I liked the occasional unpredictability of it and enjoyed not knowing where it might lead next. While most of the 11 songs on the album are originals, Tom does offer his take on a few cover tunes. The first is an intriguing version of Al Stewart's \"On The Border.\" The original arrangement is an epic composition with vocals and full orchestration, so I was interested to hear how Tom would play it on solo guitar. But he did an admirable job, and I enjoyed hearing this familiar melody in a more elemental form.\n\nAnother cover song is one that I, and probably everyone on the planet, is familiar with - \"Imagine\" by John Lennon. Tom's gentle and respectful version captures the peace and love vibration that marked much of Lennon's writing. The last two compositions on the album, in a way, bookend Tom's career, highlighting past and present. \"A Brief Encounter,\" written in 1985, was his debut fingerstyle composition and is about first love and first heartache. The album comes to rest with a new song called \"What A Difference A Day Makes.\" This is one of my favorite pieces on the album and has a meandering bucolic feel, like a Sunday drive on a country road - a sublime ending to this wonderful recording. There is no doubt that Tom Carleno is a masterful fingerstyle guitarist. His songwriting is innovative and often intriguing, full of unexpected twists and turns. \"Perfect Imperfection\" is perfectly wonderful instrumental guitar music.","classification":5,"fold":0}

How it rates to his other albums, probably right in the middle, not his worst (which I'd still say is a strong 4 star album) and not the best.

{"text":"Trivium is a new favorite speed metal\/thrash band of mine.  They are bringing intricate guitar solos back into modern heavy metal music, much to the everlasting joy of metal fans like me, who are tiring of the repetitive guitar \"riffing\" of most modern nu-metal-influenced bands. These guys play fast and complex and are good at it.\n\nTheir first two albums are fantastic, especially their sophomore effort\n\"Ascendancy\", but to be honest, I was a bit concerned about buying their new one. I had read some disturbing internet rumors about it being a transparent Metallica rip-off. And then the first song was released on their MySpace page, called \"Detonation,\" and I was not terribly thrilled with it. It sounded like they were trying too hard to sound like early Metallica, which is a noble thing to attempt, but I just wasn't into it. I'm not into early Metallica at all, really.  But I bought it anyway, cause I had to hear it for myself and I chose to support the band by purchasing the album instead of just downloading it. And at first, I was pretty worried.\n\nThe first track is called \"Ignition\" and sounds a lot like the second track, the aforementioned \"Detonation.\" They aren't bad songs, per se, but they seemed a bit too old-school for a band that I felt was the beginning of the new age of speed metal. The guitar work was brilliant as ever, but the tone of the music just did not click.\n\nOne thing I did kind of like was the fact that the lead singer, Matt Heafy, was actually singing this time around. Their first two albums were full of angsty, unintelligible screaming for the most part. And while I have no problem with that, there are times when I actually like to understand what the lead singer is saying. But he doesn't scream barely at all this album, which is a bummer cause he was a good screamer. And other reviewers have mentioned the apparent similarity between Heafy's voice and the singing voice of one James Hetfield. This only fueled the \"Metallica rip-off\" claims more.\n\nThe third track, \"Entrance Of The Conflagration,\" was the first one to really pick up my interest. It's a bit heavier than the first two, and without the more obvious Metallica influence. But it's the lyrics that really got me, which were helped by Heafy's clear singing.\n\n\"Forcing her own blood down \/ Beneath the water to drown \/ Lying dead with eyes wide open\"\n\nLike most metal bands, Trivium's lyrics took a back seat to the music on their first two albums. Their lyrics were better than some, but nothing really special, dealing with the common themes of depression, betrayal, angst, and death. But this was the first song that was clearly about something specific. Afterward, I learned that the song is about Andrea Yates, the woman who drowned her five young children in a bathtub. That's serious, right there.\n\nThe next song is \"Anthem (We Are The Fire),\" which I liked because of its song-along chorus and positive vibe. By this point, I was warming to the album after its ho-hum first two tracks.\n\nTrack five is the song \"Unrepentant,\" which grabbed me again because of its very specific lyrics. Like \"Entrance of the Conflagration,\" it was a song about a brutal real-life murder, this time about a Pakistani man named Nazir Ahmad who murdered his four daughters in an honor killing.\n\nThe next song is \"And Sadness Will Sear\", which is quite simply the most powerful song Trivium has ever done. It is about the murder of Matthew Shepard, the gay man in Wyoming who was brutally beaten, tied to a fence in a field, and left to die. Heafy sings the verses in a soft, subdued voice and cries out the chorus very passionately. The guitar work is not a prominent in this song, limited to the short solo and song's finale, but the lyrics are sorrowful and heartfelt.\n\n\"Tied to the fence as they break you \/ And sadness will sear \/ Cold is the wind that will freeze you \/ And sadness will sear \/ It's 12:53 AM when the scarecrow died \/ A victim of society's cruelty \/ It's 12:53 AM when the shepherd died\"\n\nTrack seven is \"Becoming The Dragon\", a fast and heavy rocker to pick up the pace after the somber \"And Sadness Will Sear.\" It's got a great song-along chorus and a unique solo near the end of the song.\n\n\"To The Rats\" is the next song, one of the fastest on the album so far. The lyrics are forgettable, but the guitar work once more is fast and relentless. And it marks the sixth song in a row that doesn't sound like Metallica. One more odd thing about this track is that they swear a few times, and Trivium doesn't really swear that much.\n\n\"This World Can't Tear Us Apart\" is next, and if you can't tell from the title, this is the closest Trivium gets to an actual love song on any of their albums. It's not a slow song by any rate, with some great soloing, but the lyrics at times do get a little cheesy. A cheesy love song is okay though if you don't listen to the words so much.\n\nTrack number ten is the song \"Tread The Floods\", which should totally be released as a single. It's the best straightforward song on the album, fast and complex music with catchy lyrics, and almost impossible not to headbang to.\n\n\"Tread the floods so you can hope to seize \/ Your own reality before it escapes thee \/ Watch yourself drown in disarray \/ It's time to break away or we'll die today\"  I know those aren't the best lyrics in the world. Nobody uses the word \"thee\" anymore. But the initial guitar solo and the longer solo in the middle of the song are totally awesome.\n\nThe next track is the awkwardly-titled \"Contempt Breeds Contamination,\" which sounds like something off a Hatebreed album. The song itself is another tale of brutality and murder, this time the death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed man shot to death by New York police officers.\n\n\"The blood is on your hands \/ Hands which were supposed to protect\nPeople like the man you blew away \/ This isn't justice, this is corruption\nThe four protectors fired 41 shots \/ Hitting him 19 times \/ Searching the body, there were no weapons found \/ He lies with all who died in vain.\"\n\nThe twelfth track is \"The Rising,\" one of the coolest songs Trivium has done to date. It's got a groovy beat and sounds like a hand-clapping arena rocker from someone like Bruce Springsteen. Oddly enough, this song demonstrates Trivium's talent, because it's unlike anything they have done so far. And it's got another rocking chorus:\n\n\"So raise your voices with me \/ And sing this song of unity \/ So raise your hands up with me \/ And hold this moment eternally\"\n\nThe last song, aptly titled \"The Crusade\" is the song all speed metal freaks wait for. It's an eight-minute long instrumental. Trivium, if memory serves, has never done a real instrumental before, and this raging, adrenaline-fueled piece of metal mastery is one of the best I've heard in years.\n\nSo it turns out my worries were unfounded. In my opinion, the two weakest songs on the album were the first two tracks, and the rest of the album is just completely awesome. Definitely Trivium's best, and one of the best metal albums released this year. Those who claim it's a Metallica rip-off probably stopped listening after the first two songs, which I can't really blame them for, cause I was tempted to. But some of the songs are just unbelievable, in particular \"Entrance Of The Conflagration,\" \"And Sadness Will Sear,\" \"Tread The Floods,\" and \"The Rising.\"","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"The first time I ever heard of King was on a roll up of Grammy nominees for this year. It featured a sound sample,and really enjoyed what I heard. This trio is made up of two sisters in songwriter Amber Strother and her instrumentalist sister Paris. They also have another member in Anita Bias. The pair culturally intersect their birth home of Minneapolis,being the daughters of local bluesman Percy Strother and in LA where they grew up. That's quite a significant musical intersection right there. In terms of the album,that back round provided a major curiosity as to where their general sound would go. Got the answers,and even than there's enough for still more questions.\n\n  This album could be described as one that's separated into three \"suites\" of different types of songs. \"The Right One\",\"The Greatest\" (a tribute to the late Muhammad Ali) and the closer \"Native Land\" are all cinematic mid 80's style electro funk numbers-filled with jazzy chord and key changes along with the trio's elaborate vocal harmonies. That singing approach carries over to the slower songs \"Supernatural\",\"Love Song\",\"In The Meantime\" and \"The Story\"-all of which have an almost ambient subtlety to the same basic instrumental framework. Meanwhile \"Carry On\",\"Mister Chameleon\" and \"Hey\" all showcase a shuffling retro girl group rhythm with more succinct three part harmonies.\n\n  'We Are King' is definitely a singers album. But one that understands the importance of groups in that respect. Their harmonies,rather than solos get the priority. And the music has nothing to do with ego. Their chordally complex melodies are of a sort that require an epic sound. And they bring in that mixture of Jam & Lewis's work with the SOS Band (out of Minneapolis and LA,no less) as well as a strong dose of Afro Futurism to their conceptualization. Honestly,it might be my personal favorite album of 2016. It has a consistent sound that the trio do a lot with. And in the end,all of it really comes together in such a rhythmically beautiful way.","classification":5,"fold":0}

I have definitely loved their first song Breakeven when it came out 3 years ago. But sadly, their later songs haven't been able to thrive in regards to voice and spirit. That is the case with their latest song Hall Of Fame, the lead single from their third album, #3. The song is alright, but not absolutely anything out of the ordinary from what I have heard from The Script, and from other artists before. I definitely am appealed to The Script, because they have made better music than a lot of other acts out there right now.

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"This delightful sampler of The Beatles' very own label is a lot of fun, if also loaded with plenty of trifles. It pulls a whole batch of lost 45's and gathers them onto one 21 songs salute. It's also a bit of a history lesson as to where The Beatles themselves thought music would head. They where often spot on, with the discovery of Badfinger (3 singles), James Taylor (the original version of \"Carolina On My Mind\") and Billy Preston (two singles). There's a few misses who should have been bigger (Mary Hopkin, with her classic \"Those Were The Days\") and Chris Hodge, whose near hit in the USA, \"We're On Our Way\" was one of the last Apple Singles.\n\nAlso plenty of fun stuff in the middle, like British Starr Jankie Lomax's Harrison penned \"Sour Milk Sea\" and a novelty TV theme for a Brit Comedy \"Thingumybob,\" written by McCartney and played by The Black Dyke Mills Band (allegedly the \"most famous brass band in the world). The goofiest of these is the rarity \"King of Fuh,\" by Brute Force, who was a member of The Tokens (of all groups!). Reportedly only 1,000 copies were ever pressed and its obscene double-entendre (\"All hail the Fuh King\") had factory workers at EMI refusing to handle it.\n\nThere's a handful of duds, as well. Hot Chocolate eventually became a hit-making pop band (\"Emma\" and \"Every #1's a Miracle\"), but their reggaed version of \"Give Peace a Chance\" is forgettable. Lennon's early foray into political singles, \"God Save Us,\" is overbearing. \"Golden Slumbers-Carry That Weight\" by Trash was a sneak peak at The Beatles' \"Abbey Road,\" and won't make you forget the more famous version. It's very telling to hear how many of these artists were \"Applized,\" with different members of The Beatles writing, playing or producing these acts in their own image. Compare Taylor's Apple \"Carolina On My Mind\" to the more famous version; it's obvious he was being pushed to a sound that wasn't a completely natural fit.\n\nOverall, however, \"Come And Get It\" is a treasure trove of lost singles that Pop History buffs will thrilled to have. Beatlemaniacs will find it a must own, and plenty of folks who'd listen to old AM radios will likely discover forgotten songs buried in the back of their aural memories.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"This is more of a 4.25 star album (yes, I'm getting nit-picky here).  I love Two Steps from Hell, and Thomas Bergersen's previous album \"Illusions\" was magnificent (10 stars for that one).  This one sounded better in the 30-sec previews; I found it has a very tribal quality (due to the vocals) upon listening to the tracks all the way through.  It's in my writing playlist rotation, as I don't think it's a bad album...it's just not quite what I was expecting.  Still, it's grown on me the more I've listened to it - one of those cases of familiarity breeding enjoyment.  I don't regret my purchase; this is one I might have delayed, however, if I'd had the forethought to listen to it on YouTube.  While \"Illusions\" remains a masterful work with infinite replay value, \"Sun\" is more a mood thing and one I don't find myself reaching to play as often.","classification":4,"fold":0}

I was just a little disappointed that they did not include her 1986 minor hit \"Wise Up\". I really like that song but it is not included on here. Also \"I Will Be Your Friend\" and \"Big Yellow Taxi\", are not included here as well. They also could of included her Christmas single \"Tennessee Christmas\".

And this is one of them I was around 7-10 years old in 2003, and I remember how soul siring the songs \"Voice of Truth\", \"We Are The Body\" and \"Who Am I\" appeared on the radio for the first time. That is such an overrated statement. These songs were more then soul stirring. They were convicting and pinned the nail right on the donkey. Even for such a kid like I was. I can't believe how raw this album is, looking back at it. The lyrics are phenomenal. But it doesn't stop there; the instruments, the key signatures, octaves, rhythms and melodies. They play a very key role in this album.

{"text":"The original motion picture soundtrack to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sparkle-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack\/dp\/B008A5H9HE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sparkle: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack<\/a>&nbsp;precedes the film, set to be released to theaters August 17.  Executively produced by Debra Martin Chase, Salim Akil, Mara Brock and T.D. Jakes, Sparkle contains eleven songs.  Songs include classics penned by Curtis Mayfield as well as originals by R. Kelly, Andrew Wansel, and Cee Lo Green (Thomas Callaway).  The best numbers from Sparkle are R. Kelly's cuts, which allow their respective vocalist (Jordin Sparks) to shine at her best.  The soundtrack is a mixed-bag, with some of the strongest cuts tacked on towards the end.\n\n\"I'm A Man,\" performed and co-written by Cee Lo Green, opens the album solidly enough, but doesn't possess the same magical zest as Cee Lo's best songs. The 1960s style soul sound is a highlight, though the cut never quite makes it past the hump of feeling like a `soundtrack' cut as opposed to feeling like a genuine soul entity aside from a compilation.  That may sound trivial, but put \"I'm A Man\" aside Cee Lo's \"I'm Old Fashioned\" and the differences are clear.\n\n\"Yes I Do,\" performed by Carmen Ejoga and produced by Oak, continues the retro-soulful vibe of \"I'm A Man.\" Ejoga's vocals are a playful and casual, not unlike the Supremes of the 60's-70s, but still the listener is longing for her to evoke more grit and bite.  Finally towards the end Ejoga stops `cooing' and tries to emote more soul-laden nuance, but it is a `little bit too late.'\n\n\"Running,\" performed by Goapele and penned\/produced by Chuck Harmony and Claude Kelly works relatively well.  Goapele achieves a more notable vocal performance than Carmen Ejoga on the previous cut, not to mention the sound production work with pummeling drums, horns, and organ. The tag line \"Running, running, and running, running\" takes one back to The Black Eyed Peas's \"Let's Get It Started\" - I'm just saying.\n\n\"Jump,\" performed by Carmen Ejoga, Tika Sumpter and Jordin Sparks is the first of a couple of Curtis Mayfield penned cuts.  Produced by Pop & Wansel, the resulting sound is one that is a light, clean update of Mayfield.  It lacks the funk of the blaxploitation proponent, but it is executed well enough.  The use of background vocals as support is a nice feature if nothing else is.\n\n\"Hooked On Your Love,\" also penned by Mayfield and produced by Wansel, is solid and smooth in sound.  Soul is evoked well throughout, though sometimes the lead vocals are too much `smoke' with not enough `bite.' That said, if the comparison is The Supremes, then the trio are rock-solid.  One of the lengthier showings on this brisk soundtrack at over 4:00, the extended horn and bass instrumental work is a highlight.\n\n\"Something He Can Feel\" is the first R. Kelly production, even if it comes by way of Curtis Mayfield's songwriting.  With a \"Your Precious Love\" quote to open, one can sense \"Something He Can Feel\" has a more authentic, natural feel than some of the other productions.  David Huff provides superb horn arrangements, adding to the bluesy sound cultivated. Smooth and sophisticated, \"Something He Can Feel\" is nothing incredibly new, but is none too shabby either.\n\n\"His Eye Is On The Sparrow\" is one of only two Whitney Houston cuts, which may come as a disappointment to fans searching for that posthumously released album.  In decorated traditional gospel style, the cut (produced by The Underdogs) opens with keyboard accentuated with swirls of organ, performed by Kenneth Crouch. Houston performs the track solidly considering the vocal limitations of her later career, but listening makes you hearken back to `if this was vintage Whitney, she would've have slaughtered this song.' The addition of Voices of Praise towards the end is a sound touch, one that listeners wished had entered a couple of seconds earlier and last at least a couple of seconds longer.\n\n\"Look Into Your Heart\" is Jordin Spark's first solo venture on the album, finding her covering Curtis Mayfield.  The cut is just ok; it doesn't quite suit Sparks's vocal sensibilities and feels forced.  Thankfully, Sparks redeems herself on an R. Kelly original that is arguably the best of the album in \"One Wing.\" \"One Wing\" feels natural on Sparks, who has a superb voice and vocal range.  With a gospel feel combined with hip-hop rhythmic sensibility, \"One Wing\" is modern enough while retaining the classic.  With excellent utilization of choir, \"One Wing\" is a step in the right direction for the soundtrack.\n\n\"Love Will\" keeps up Jordin's pace as R. Kelly keeps atoning for any earlier miscues from Sparkle.  The other Whitney feature, a duet with Sparks, \"Celebrate,\" which keeps Kelly on the payroll ends the album solidly.  While not initially a fan of the duet when it was released as a single, it grows on you and does give Houston enthusiasts a posthumous cut to add to their collection.  If nothing else, it is well produced.\n\nOverall,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sparkle-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack\/dp\/B008A5H9HE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sparkle: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack<\/a>&nbsp;has some triumphant moments while others are just, `eh.' It will undoubtedly be compared to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Dreamgirls-Music-From-The-Motion-Picture-2-CD-Deluxe-Edition\/dp\/B000JLQQ2G\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dreamgirls: Music From The Motion Picture [2-CD Deluxe Edition<\/a>] soundtrack, which it can not hope to compete with; that soundtrack was stellar and better conceived.  If you enjoy soul and gospel music, you will enjoy this soundtrack, particularly R. Kelly's contributions.","classification":3,"fold":0}
{"text":"The only complaint about \"Have a Holly Jolly Christmas\" is that Burl Ives sings only a dozen songs on it and you can find CD collections that will offer more tracks culled from his various Christmas albums.  His first, \"Christmas Day in the Morning,\" came out in 1952, followed by \"Christmas Eve\" in 1956.  \"Have a Holly Jolly Christmas\" came out in 1965, with the soundtrack to the classic holiday television special \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" the following year.  The title song of this album was written by for the special by Johnny Marks, who also wrote the song \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" which Ives sings on this album, and the final track, \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.\"  That is a pretty good trio of Christmas songs, which would make Marks one of the best writers of Christmas songs ever.\n\nHow this album is different from the previous Burl Ives Christmas albums is that he has shifted to this point to more of a pop-oriented approach to singing Christmas songs that the traditional folk style that defined his earlier albums.  There are still some folk songs on this album, with \"Christmas is a Birthday,\" \"Christmas Child (Loo, Loo, Loo),\" \"Christmas Can't Be Far Away,\" and \"Snow for Johnny.\"  But most of the songs are definitely more popular than secular, with \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town,\" \"White Christmas,\" \"Winter Wonderland,\" and \"Silver Bells.\"  I tend to think of \"The Little Drummer Boy\" as being more religious than it really us, but that is more because the music is more hymn-like.\n\nThe net result is that you have Burl Ives singing eight recognizable Christmas songs and introducing you to four songs that you have probably not heard before that are perfectly suited to his strengths as a singer.  Ives started out in the 1920s as an itinerate folk singers, moved to Broadway in the 1930s, appeared on the radio in the 1940s, and became a popular folk singer in the 1950s.  But most people today probably remember him as the Snowman who narrates the story of \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" that still airs each holiday season forty years later.  Because of that connection it is entirely possible that a Burl Ives Christmas album will be warmly received in your home by those who do not know about the rest of his resume.  He certainly produces the requisite warm seasonal feelings.","classification":5,"fold":0}
{"text":"Love it all. Cornell's solo efforts typically fall into Adult Contemporary.  If you are a fan of Temple of the Dog, Soundgarden, and\/or Audioslave, please note that solo work is very different material.  I love his voice and style which is why I pre-ordered this album.  I have most of his collection, even though I didn't care much for his 2009 pairing with a Timbaland, where the two took a turn down a twisted path.\n\nThis album has Brendan O'Brien as producer and, funnily enough, the drums are mostly homegrown loops. Where this normally bothers me, it works on this album since Cornell is more about his voice and guitar skills.\n\nThere is an eclectic mix on this album.  Sample it first before pulling the trigger.  Some are total AC and others are unique, catchy tunes.  In any event, this is a wonderful effort.\n\nI typically try to include a handful of songs as my tops of an album, but after numerous listenings, that is still pretty hard. They are all equally good for various reasons (lyrics, hooks, chorus).\n\nObviously, Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart is solid (it was the first single). Murder of Blue Skies, Only These Words and Higher Truth stick out, as the tempo is faster than the majority of tracks. Our Time in The Universe is catchy as hell and you also get a remix on this album. It almost connects back with Scream, but in a much better way.\n\nHaving had numerous plays, I will be completely shocked if Our Time in the Universe isn't a huge success!  Which version? Hmm. Not sure  as both are great.  If you are a Delain fan, it is like choosing which version of We Are The Others is \"better.\"","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"KD Lang is back with a new band called Siss Bang Boom.  Her new album is entitled \"Sing It Loud\".  \"I Confess\" is my favorite track on this record. This tune has a vulnerable sounding quality in the first half minute or so, but this song picks up lyrically and musically into a song that sounds strong and bold by the end.  This is in due in large part to the guitar playing by Joshua Grange.  He is an excellent guitar player. He gives this song a punch that makes it special.  The title cut is \"Sing It Loud\". This song has a very relaxing tone.  The banjo playing is subtle and lovely on this track.  Joe Pisapia plays the banjo superbly here.  KD really chooses top notch musicians to join her band.  The best love song on this record is \"The Water's Edge\". KD's voice has a romantic quality to it. \"A Sleep With No Dreaming\" is another pretty song with romantic tone. I like this song a lot. \"Sorrow Nevermore\" is the happiest song on this album. This song is truly pleasant.  I love the banjo and percussion playing on this song. \"Inglewood\" is a tribute song to a place that KD Lang holds dear.  She makes California sound like a great place to live. \"Heaven\" is a very peaceful song.  KD sounds very soothing on this song.  Perfect Word is another song with great musical arrangements. The steel petal and guitar playing  is absolutely beautiful on this song.  \"Sugar Buzz\" is a song with a laid back quality.  This song is about a person's love can be addictive.  KD Lang makes me believe in love again. This new record is really enjoyable.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"At least Yung Berg makes it interesting though. Ray J's part is catchy, and very hummable but it's easy for someone to get tired of it before the end of the song.\n\nOn the video front I think this has to be said: Yung Berg is definitely there, feeling ladies' arms and such but I bet 10 to 1 that he's into his own kind too. I think it just sucks because they're afraid to have diversity as far as sexuality goes in the mainstream rap world. That altogether shows how the rap scene tolerates difference.\n\nI mean if a black male is undercover, so what? Why does everyone feel like that's such a big deal? It's only human nature to have different types of people all over.\n\nBut anyway, decent song. Not totally garbage, but like I said Ray J's part is repetitive and Yung Berg as well as the fun beat keeps the song afloat.\n\n3.5 stars.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Five MARVELOUS Stars!! A STELLAR Grammy-nominated musical look at desire and temptation. For a decade and an half,  jazz diva Tierney Sutton's highly creative band has been one of jazz' longer-running small ensembles. Some of her CDs are thematic, such as the Bill Evans tribute<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Blue-in-Green\/dp\/B00005N581\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Blue in Green<\/a>and the sideways glance of<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/On-the-Other-Side\/dp\/B000LV6RBE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">On the Other Side<\/a>of love (\"Get Happy\" as a dirge was both daring and effective). This highly enjoyable CD can also be looked at from the 'spiritual thematic point of view' decrying the seductive dangers of fame and fortune or even as homage' from one of today's certified young jazz divas to past singing stars like Peggy Lee (Fever), Carmen McRae (Skylark) and Julie London (Cry Me a River). Lady Day, Abbey, June, Betty, and Ella also come to mind. As usual, Ms Sutton is a cohesive member of her talented, somewhat instrumentally unusual quintet, as in the title of another CD called<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/I-m-with-the-Band\/dp\/B000A8AXHM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">I'm with the Band<\/a>. Versatile pianist Christian Jacob, drummer Ray Brinker (who is on fire) and 2 inventive bassists: Kevin Axt  & Trey Henry who work well together on the bottom, round out the five spots. These 5 take some familiar standards into new fiery frameworks and multi-rhythmic setups, often shifting gears in flight out of serene starts to dizzying heights and back again (e.g. the smoldering \"Love Me or Leave Me\").\n\nThe 'best of the best' begins with a beautiful 7 minute exposition of \"It's Only A Paper Moon\" which starts with a spiritual poem over an urgent Ray Brinker beat. That effectively contrasts with Tierney's out of tempo rhapsodic vocalizing which then leads to a burning in-tempo Christian Jacob solo with Brinker pouring on the heat with his brushes. A sensational \"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\" again has the urgent beat and voice, as the song takes on a celestial meaning for the word \"Daddy\" as Brinker's accents and rimshots burn behind Tierney's and Jacob's sizzling highly-stylized solos. The two bassists also effectively use differing pizzicato roles on the bottom and in the arrangements. \"Long Daddy Green\" switches the \"Daddy\" word and performance to something more seductive. \"Fever\" escapes Julie London's spell as Tierney puts her stamp on it, bending, twisting, and chopping the notes. \"It's All Right With Me\" is a smoky experience. Even the insistent multi-tracked \"Whatever Lola Wants\" bends to Tierney's musical will, as does \"Skylark\". Tierney Sutton & Band prove it's all about the emphasis & crank up another BIG Winner. DON'T trust the song samples, they don't give a hint of the exhilarating flights that await beyond the intros. Stunning performances!! My Highest Recommendation. Five ENJOYABLE Stars.

{"text":"While this marks the second remastering and repackaging of Santana's debut, this two-disc set is worth the price of admission.  Originally released in August of 1969,the same month as their stunning performance at Woodstock, Santana released one of the strongest albums of their thirty-year-plus career. But while their debut was a wonderful collection of terrific songs--\"Evil Ways, \"Jingo,\" \"Persuasion\"--they were an even better live band.\n\nThe 1998 reissue featured three of their songs from Woodstock, including the 11:49 gem \"Soul Sacrifice.\"  This 2004 Legacy edition includes their entire Woodstock set (with the exception of \"Evil Ways\"), adding four more songs:  \"Waiting,\" \"You Just Don't Care, \"Jingo\" and \"Persuasion.\"\n\nAdditional material on the bonus disc are studio sessions of songs like \"Soul Sacrifice\" and \"\"Persuasion\" that were recorded before drummer Michael Shrieve and percussionist Joe Areas were brought into the band, revealing compelling but alternate performances of these songs.\n\nEven if you already own the 1998 remaster, this is the definitive release.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED","classification":5,"fold":0}

I was extremely pleased with the light-hearted, yet quality material on this album.  While listening to the very nicely constructed melodies and lyrics, I found my top tapping and head bobbing.  This album compels you to move!  The strongest songs on the album are: U & Me = Love (strange title, but excellent), America, Becoming, Yes U Can, Sweet Temptation, Haunted and Intuition.  It seems she really wanted to \"cook\" on the last half of the album because those songs have the best musical content, lyrically and musically, in my opinion.\nThis is a definite buy!

I liked her as a peppy teen on Star Search, I was both enthralled and disgusted by her nekkid suit video, and I wanted to be in the car with her (maybe she'd let me borrow that cool hat she was wearing) in that dopey video for that song from the similarly caustic \"Jagged Little Pill\".  Well, this album's not all that much different than the last two.\nSure, she's done the writing her self.  But...is that such a good thing?  Her tunes are tuneful and the playing is top-notch and very catchy.  But it's the lyrics Heavy Hop Dop can't get behind.  It's the same old woe-is-me, mopey, men are bad-I am sad kinda garbage she's been spitting out for the past five years.  And I've had enough.  There's enough misery around Hoppy's life that I don't have to listen to some multi-millionaire pound my ears with her miserable encounters.  Of course, she does seem to make the most of them.  And I admire her for that.  To summarize:  Good tunes.  Good playing.  Annoying lyrics.  No nekkid suit.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Trina released a very enjoyable album for April Fool's Day 2008!  I thought her debut was decent, but not at all groundbreaking, so I thought this album would be along the lines of her debut, but oh no!  It's a lot better.  \"Still Da Baddest\" is definitely a solid album.  Trina is still talking about sex, how pretty she is (and she is pretty), how great her sex is, and she reminds us that she's still \"da baddest b****.\"  Ironically, though, when I read her interviews, she does not come off as b****y at all.  She seems to be a very kind, gentle and mature woman.  I know there is another side, but it's nice to know that she is a sweetheart beneath the sassiness.\n\n Up-beat tunes and good lyrics fill this album.  Trina's delivery is as energetic and confident as ever, and trust me, you will be dancing and\/or snapping at some point when listening to this album.  Sure, this album is on the experimental side and Trina's voice serves as an annoyance because it is unusually high-pitched  sometimes, but, as a unit, rap fans should be entertained by this LP.  \"Single Again\" was the album's first release.  The catchy hook will really help you get into this song, particularly its melody. Also, this is one of Trina's best songs lyrically.  She apparently sat down and thought this song out before penning it.  Nice beat, too.  Trina is a product of Miami and it was a nice touch for her to speak with a southern drawl on \"Killing You H***.\"  In this song, Trina informs her listener that she is hot and these other women aren't on her level nor are they doing anything for her.  Again, the beat is nice and the hook is alright as well.  Pitbull lends his talents on \"Stop Traffic.\"  His voice is so easy to listen to and he adds flavor to the song.  Every song on this album is at least decent, therefore, you can press play and listen to it from track one to track twelve.\n\n Trina is definitely improving as a rapper.  This is a really nice LP and is recommended by me.  Continue progressing, Trina.  You have a supporter in me.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"Still da Baddest\"\n2. \"I Got a Bottle\"\n3. \"Hot Commodity\"\n4. \"Look Back at Me\"\n5. \"Single Again\"","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"This may be one of the most uninteresting albums I have heard this year; the beats sound uninspired and the content becomes repetitive and lacks strength for the most part.  The production is handled by a variety of producers but none of the tracks really stand out and grasp the listener.  It sounds like the beats are trying to be trying to be a hybrid between pop and rap.  Lupe Fiasco performs well, with messages sprinkled throughout but none of the messages is anything new or interesting.  Accompany this with lacklustre choruses, fueled by jingles, it blatantly takes away from the message and does not sound good in general.  Do not get me wrong, this is technically sound with more than adequate rapping and thought out beats with breaks but it is just sounds like it is missing a whole lot.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Note that in my introduction I've pointed out that this album has increased the number of options the band has for it's live set. What it doesn't do is expand the Nickelback sound beyond some slight alterations to the production qualities from their previous album. What it does do however is to expand their catalogue with more of the same accomplished and very rock radio friendly hard rock. And there is nothing wrong with that.\n\nWhat your unlikely to get from this band are departures like their heroes Metallica did with their Load and Reload, this is a band that seems very focussed on what they want to achieve and they go after their targets and it's a form of professionalism that can stunt creativity a bit but it also produces consistent results.\n\nListening to this album while writing this review it becomes apparent that the bands love of musuclar riffing that bludgens their audience has not diminished. Opener Flat On The Floor is a perfect example of the sort of post grunge hard rock rifferama your going to get with this. Second cut Do This Anymore is more of the same with it's Chad Kroeger vocal lead laid over the top of unspectacular yet insistent guitar blasts.\n\nThis consistency means Nickelback are a very safe bet for punter, their fans know just what they are getting in the same way that AC\/DC fans or Yngwie Malmsteen fans know what they are in for before the disc even hits their stereo. That could be construed as a bad thing but I'm willing to forgive Nickelback their familiarity, their lack of real departure from their norm, in order to get an album I know I can throw on and listen from beginning to end.\n\nThat's not to say that there are no variations from the opening note to the closing one. There are rockers such as the first two cuts mentioned earlier. There are songs that are ballads and there are songs with a sense of humour, all tied neatly together with that feeling you get when one of your mates starts telling you a story you've heard a dozen times before. And there are a number of songs that fall somewhere between rocker and ballad, a sort of rock radio staple sound and I find it impossible to hate Nickelback for their discovery of a successful formula.\n\nWith musicianship that's of a decent standard yet never ego driven, good production qualities that retain a human feeling and a feeling of familiarity in almost every sound bite this album is more of the same in the best way.","classification":4,"fold":0}

Substantial segments of his speeeches and interviwes are provided with good narration to tie it all together.\n\nAs a child born exactly one year, one month, one day, and one hour (December 23, 1964) after JFK's murder, my father would occasionally play this on the stereo at home and this turned me on to JFK. Even at that age, I somehow understood the challenge of his inauguration, the call to put men on the moon, the urging for peace in 63, and the Civil Rights speech in particular spoke to me then and sends chills up my spine today.\n\nOnly complaint-this needs to be on CD.

{"text":"The new Sacred Warrior release is bittersweet. Its amazing to hear these guys shred again after 22 years of studio silence, it truly is remarkable. But the absence of Ray Parra on vocals  especially after all the anticipation  is a major heartbreak. Yes, Eli Prinsen (The Sacrificed) is an amazing singer in his own right, but Parra is to Sacred Warrior what Dickenson is to Maiden so that magic and familiarity is missing here. Nevertheless, with the help of Prinsen and new keyboardist Joe Petit,  Swift, Watkins and Velazquez have crafted some very heavy and credible power metal reminiscent of the Obsessions album. Fans will not be disappointed by the musical direction as the songs are both melodic and riff heavy  a quality that always distinguished them from their peers back in the day when most Christian metal bands were either melodic or they were extreme. At times some of the phrasing sounds a bit awkward, especially on the two opening tracks, but overall the songwriting quality is solid and I think the songs get better as the disc progresses. Long Live The King, Fear Me and Living Sacrifice are vintage Sacred Warrior metal anthems! As always, the lyrics are biting, truthful yet non-clich  a consistent strength of the band.  Packaging and production are indie all the way, but not in a bad way. It would have been nice, however, to have a graphically cleaner cover design\/image. Bittersweet feelings aside, though, there is nothing here to dissuade any fan from enjoying the first original material in 2 decades from this premier pioneering Christian power metal band!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Mozart's serenade and chamber music compositions are some of my favorite pieces, and while I have plenty of recordings of this music already, I didn't hesitate in getting this Bach Guild selection. I'm interested in hearing the interpretations from the performers included here, and so far I've been very happy with how they sound.\n\nIn fact, this is a sort of 'highlight' or 'greatest hits'  set with some of Mozart's most famous and well-loved works, including the ubiquitous Eine Kleine Nachtmusick, here given an excellent performance by the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra led by the late Iona Brown, the Serenata nocturne, and the Hafner Serenade. It also includes a performance of the K. 361 'Gran Partita' serenade for winds that is one of my very favorite pieces (isn't it everyones?) and is here performed by Leopold Stokowski leading the American Symphony Winds, perhaps a rare recording (?) and one I'm enjoying right now as I write this review.\n\nMy iTunes tallies this up as 4 hours and 8 minutes altogether, the perfect length for an afternoon of really delightful and enjoyable music.\n\nThe performances do vary in style and sound, of course, with some of the differences coming from the different dates of the recordings as well as the miking and quality of the recording itself. For example, there is a marked difference between the lightness of performance we hear from Iona Brown's Norwegian Chamber Orchestra, which I find particularly enjoyable for this music, and the much more close miked David Blum led Esterhazy Orchestra, which takes some adjustment. The ordering of the music in this collection, with pieces from each orchestra alternated, is probably not optimal or at least not to my particular taste. That is a minor point, however.\n\nAnother interesting observation that can be made when listening to these various performances is how different the sound is from a small chamber orchestra performance of these Mozart pieces, compared to a large orchestra. The K. 250 serenade here is performed by the Vienna State Opera Orchestra, and after listening to the smaller ensembles that precede it in the collection, the contrast is quite obvious and striking. My personal preference is to hear these works performed by a small ensemble, but others may feel differently, and here we have a sampling of both for those who may be less familiar with the difference it makes to the sound.\n\nContents and links to the recordings where these performances have previously appeared (I will add performance dates and other details as I am able to determine them.

{"text":"Bruce Springsteen's first seven albums make up one of the most impressive streaks of quality for any artist, yet aside from two of those records, none of them have ever been brought up to date sonically, doing a great disservice to these otherwise excellent records by not presenting them the way they deserved to be heard.\n\nUntil now.\n\n\"The Album Collection Vol. 1 1973-84\" more than rectifies this issue. The sound throughout these seven records is uniformly fantastic and each one leaps out of the speakers with impressive clarity and volume. It's cliched, but it really does feel like you are listening to some of these records for the first time, especially \"Greetings,\" \"Wild and Innocent,\" and \"The River,\" all of which suffered from either being too flat (the former two) or harsh and tinny (\"The River\"). There are parts of songs I never noticed before, particularly on more ponderous tracks like \"New York City Serenade\" and \"Drive All Night.\"\n\nThe packaging is okay (not a fan of the cardboard cases and the paper disc holders), but the booklet is very impressive for fans. Musically, however, this is as good as it gets and a must have for all Springsteen fans.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"It's been a very long time since I have been nice to Tori. And why not? She delivered a masterpiece (\"Little Earthquakes\") that still stands the test of time today (and yes, I was there to buy it when it was released in February 1992--and if you were there for \"Y Kant Tori Read\" well, good for you!) And then, lyrically, something happened. She became more esoteric, more metaphorical, more obtuse, more abstract, and she slowly began to distance herself from me. She sealed the deal after 1999's \"To Venus And Back\". That album marked the beginning of a very long stretch of albums that were 'ho-hum'. That is, until now.\n\n\"Unrepentant Geraldines\" has been getting good reviews from the critics and fans. I sequestered myself away as I partook in this 15 track platter. Listening again and again, over and over, and now I have come to my critic's keys, sitting myself down to type this review. I want to be fair, but critical all the same. Do I like this album? Yes. Is it the closest Amos has come to making a consistent album in many a year? Yes. For the most part, this album holds together well. This time, I felt Amos's lyrics finally became more accessible in a way they haven't been (for me at least) since the 1990's. That makes all the difference (for me). When I can get into Amos's head and 'feel' the music, then she has done her job well. And even the harshest Amos critic (which I am) would still have to admit that a song like \"Oysters\" could have easily been found on \"Little Earthquakes\". That's not all--there's \"Invisible Boy\", \"16 Shades Of Blue\", \"Promise\", \"Wild Way\", \"Rose Dover\", \"Forest Of Glass\", \"America\", \"Weatherman\". In fact, I was hard pressed to find one track that I didn't like, but if you asked, I'd have to say that I don't like her fairy songs like \"Maids Of Elfen-Mere\" or \"Selkie\".\n\nFirst single, \"Trouble's Lament\" and \"Giant's Rolling Pin\" are also good songs with a type of \"Leather\", \"Wrong Band\" sort of free-flowing quality to them. There's many interesting lyrics on this album, and many different interesting subjects. As always, her lyrics are open for interpretation, but I thought \"Promise\" was a great idea to have Tori and her daughter duet, singing about their mother-daughter relationship. I thought \"Invisible Boy\" was about Jesus. And, generally, the entire album was lyrically more interesting than many of her albums over the past decade. She turned a corner here. This is her first original album of work in five years, so that might mean something. I read somewhere that she said she needed a break, and so she did holiday music, classical music, and then orchestral music before returning now to alternative pop\/rock music.\n\nThere's no denying that Amos is extremely talented as an artist. That's why I've bought all of her music for the past 22 years. I knew when I saw the video for \"Silent All These Years\" that I would be listening to her music as long as she continued to produce it. Every artist goes through a less popular phase, and for me that would be the past decade of Amos's career, but perhaps she's back now? This is a step in the right direction. I'm also glad to say that, despite my ongoing criticisms of Amos's more recent output, she has never sold out. She has always done things her way. I'm also glad, that unlike many alternative artists, the mainstream has never really seemed to find Amos, which is fine by me. I don't want to hear her splattered all over the radio and television. You also never seem to hear her music in elevators, Starbucks, grocery stores, or anywhere else for that matter, which is also a fantastic thing. I don't want to be at the store buying Doritos when \"Me And A Gun\" begins playing overhead.\n\nAmos is also one artist that I never pair with other artists. I never think she should work with other people. She is original enough on her own. Like Kate Bush before her (although even Kate worked with Peter Gabriel and also Prince). Amos, for me, is right up there with pop piano gods Bruce Hornsby, Billy Joel and Elton John. I've seen Amos in concert (Boys For Pele, The Greek, Los Angeles 1996). She was just as great in concert.\n\n\"Unrepentant Geraldines\" makes me think this could be a late career return for Amos. Let's see what comes next...\n\nAnd before I go into the next section, I just want to say that, yes, I am one of those that does not think \"Scarlet's Walk\" was a fantastic album. In fact, it was overlong and tedious. Since Amos tends to typically make 60 minute albums in general, she still hasn't learned the golden rule that less is more. I'd like to see her cut an album under 45 minutes. I'd like to see her be economical. Even \"Unrepentant Geraldines\" is overlong at 15 tracks. She could have left off some songs and still had a good album.\n\nHere's how \"Unrepentant Geraldines\" compares with Amos's previous works:\n\n1988 Y Kant Tori Read: I've actually never heard this.\n1992 Little Earthquakes: Five Stars\n1994 Under The Pink: Five Stars\n1996 Boys For Pele: Five Stars\n1998 From The Choirgirl Hotel: Four Stars\n1999 To Venus And Back: Three and a Half Stars\n2001 Strange Little Girls: Two Stars\n2002 Scarlet's Walk: Three Stars\n2005 The Beekeeper: Three and a Half Stars\n2007 American Doll Posse: Three and a Half Stars\n2009 Abnormally Attracted To Sin: Three Stars\n2009 Midwinter Graces: Three and a Half Stars\n2011 Night Of Hunters: Three and a Half Stars\n2012 Gold Dust: Three and a Half Stars\n2014 Unrepentant Geraldines: Four Stars","classification":4,"fold":0}

Records, 2010)\n----------------------------------------------\nOne of the great troubadours of the singer-songwriter-big ol' goofball folkie scene, the venerable John Prine is, of course, a brilliant live performer, a guy who set the bar that others strive to attain.  Jovial, self-effacing and deeply funny, he's like your all-time favorite uncle or maybe the one guy at the party that you'd really *love* to get trapped with all evening long.  He's a warm, familiar presence, and this new live set captures him at hs best, singing old favorites such as \"Unwed Fathers,\" \"The Bottomless Lake,\" \"Spanish Pipedream\" and \"Your Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven Anymore.\" There are also a slew of highpowered guests, including Emmylou Harris on a nice version of \"Angel From Montgomery\" and Iris Dement, who duets on two tunes, as well as Nickel Creek's Sara Watkins and some instrumental ooomph from the Kane\/Welch\/Kaplan trio, on the album's closer, Prine's always-timely mining anthem, \"Paradise.\" Americana music doesn't get better than this, and while a lot of this music may already be on your radar, it's still a mighty fine album.

Rap, Kane, KRS \/ Pac, Common, and Kanye would say I'm blessed\" (AZ - Still Alive)\n\nAZ, perhaps, one of the most underrated lyricists to grace hip hop, returns back to the scene by dropping his new album entitled, A.W.O.L., on his new independent Quiet Money Records label.  AZ is probably best known for his now legendary guest appearance on Life's a Bitch from Nas's classic Illmatic album.  AZ has always released quality material, but he was never been able to really blow up in the music scene.  Was it industry politics?  Bad timing?  Whatever the case is, AZ has never allowed for his lack of notoriety to effect his ability in creating quality music.\n\nWith A.W.O.L., rather than following the watered-down movement that's plagued rap for the last few years, AZ stays consistent and refuses to change up his formula.  He still has that smooth flawless delivery that's been blessing listeners since the early to mid 90's.  He's still that wise street poet who somehow is able to construct verses in a nearly flawless manner.  Plus, to further compliment the lyrics, the production on this album is top notch including beats by DJ Premier, Buckwild, and others...  The only weak spot on this album may be Envious featuring Bounty Killer, but that's only due to a clash of styles.\n\nTop tracks include:  The Come Up, Never Change, Still Alive, City Of Gods, and Magic Hour.\n\nGuest appearances include Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Half-A-Mill (recently deceased), Begetz, Bounty Killer, and CL Smooth...","classification":5,"fold":0}
{"text":"Your first thought on seeing the title is, \"Has it come to this?\"  Shades of the late Sinatra and the recent Bennett\/Gaga collaborations, with the aging star still showing some moxie, and the younger acolytes paying tribute.  But it's nothing like that.  Van's voice is as robust as it has ever been, the partners in the duets are shrewdly chosen, and the mutual adaptability required is a credit to all concerned.  Best of all, this is no warmed-over \"greatest hits revisited.\"  The titles here are some lesser-known songs from some of Van's lesser-known (at least today) albums.  I recognized about three of them, which tells you that it's been a while since I listened to \"Irish Heartbeat\" (album or song), and I don't even own \"Hymns to the Silence\" or \"Veedon Fleece.\"  If I started to name favorites, I would end up listing them all, because all are just beautifully presented, in great sound and with great backup, but it is good to hear Van with Taj Mahal and Mavis Staples from the older generation of gospel-inflected blues.

{"text":"Directions To See A Ghost with it's menacing, staggering, stumbling, Jim Morrison over tones, drenched in hypnotic intoxicating drones of heavy acid trip visuals, primal drumming, and garage guitar, all blend to create a bleary eyed fantasy of mind meets soul meets eye, and washes oceans of sound through your ears.  As persuasive as The Black Angels are on record, they are even more so live, and not to be missed on any account.  The Black Angels are a psychological rhythmic reason for stepping into the moonlight, downing a handful of psychedelics, and watching the pageant unfold before your very eyes.  Even the gated album and disc jackets are heavily embossed to visually and texturally trip you out.\n\nThere's a dynamic chemistry found here, created from low end vibrations, Jimmy Page hooks, and Middle Eastern influences that don't so much build in momentum ... rather they steadily carry you forward with an intoxicating obsession.  As dark and lustrious as this album is, it feels very warm, nuturing, inviting, and impressive ... at times startling, fuzzed out, and breathtaking.  But you see, I'm trying to describe an acid trip, or a head full of mushrooms, and that's just about impossible ... you're either on board and know exactly what I'm talking about, or you're at the station, ticket in hand, waiting on sixty tons of locomotive to pull up, drop the steps, punch your ticket, and take you for the ride of a lifetime.\n\nInteresting Note:  The Black Angels, like many others, have been heavily influenced by The Velvet Underground, copping their band name from The Velvet's track \"Black Angel's Death Song.\"  And as if that weren't enough, they drew the connection even tighter by naming their publishing company Death Song, thus completing the song title in full.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"As is usual with the Bach Guild Boxes, not everything is top drawer but for 99 cents, why quibble.  The Commissiona\/Houston Symphony set of the symphonies is fine, the Ronon O'Hara recordings of various piano works is exceptional, as are the songs sung by Arlene Auger. The sonata and concerto by Clara Schumann are also worth a listen. I haven't finished exploring yet but the only performances that I've found to be \"meh\" are the Brendel recordings of the C Major Fantasy and Symphonic Etudes, but I wasn't surprised, as I was left cold by his digital Philips recording of the Fantasy, too.  For the Fantasy, I prefer Richter's EMI recording or Claudio Arrau and the recording by Yuri Egorov is in a class by itself.\n\nBut again, like many in this series, this is an exceptional bargain and combines satisfactory recordings of \"warhorses\" with an opportunity to hear pieces that you might otherwise never encounter, such as the works by Clara mentioned above and the violin etudes after Paganini's Caprices.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"From his debut hit \"Life's A Dance\" in late 1992 through the rest of the '90s, John Michael Montgomery (with his easy going baritone) was one of country music's most reliable hitmakers.  Over the past four years, however, he's had but one top ten hit, the chart topping heart tugger \"The Little Girl.\"  With his recent singles struggling, a hits collection was the logical choice for Montgomery's next release.  A sequel to 1997's GREATEST HITS made the most sense, as Montgomery has ten top 20 hits not included on that first set.  Instead, Warner Brothers went with this career encompassing VERY BEST OF that contains 11 of the 14 recordings already found on the strong selling GREATEST HITS.\nAmong the hits not included on either collection are the engaging \"Ain't Got Nothin' On Us,\" \"Love Working On You,\" and \"Hello L.O.V.E.\"  All are uptempo romps that would have contributed nicely to the ballad-heavy VERY BEST OF.  The sequencing on VERY BEST OF distorts the musical nonbalance even more, with three fast tunes leading off, followed by a slew of slow stuff.  The collection concludes with two new ballads: the paternal reflection \"Cool\" and the pledge of devotion \"One Day Less.\"  While pleasant, neither track seems likely to reverse Montgomery's recent chart struggles.  Ultimately, while it contains more tracks and covers a longer period of Montgomery's recording career, this VERY BEST OF is not as enjoyable to listen to as his earlier GREATEST HITS.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"When it has honestly came down to Rihanna and ballads, most of them have absolutely been awful, except Hate That I Love You with Ne-Yo. But other than that sole one, she definitely has lost her chemistry in her voice. That has shown in most of the songs from the past several years. Stay, the third single from her Unapologetic record feels like a sad song, but she doesn't put out there as much from her voice as she could have. She could have brought in someone who could have been more of a equal as singer. For a newcomer like Mikki Echo, he did not bring much out his voice either into the song. I think Rihanna should definitely find more from her voice, to make her ballads ignite, and that sadly isn't there anymore.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":0}

In June of 1965, The Beatles released their eighth album entitled BEATLES VI (pronouned Beatles 6), another compilation album, featuring six new songs.\n\n  In August of 1965, The Beatles released their ninth album entitled, HELP! This album coincides with their second film of the same name. What made their film, HELP!, different from their film, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, is that HELP! was in color. This album is another one of The Beatles' best albums. An album no Beatles fan can refuse.\n\nHELP!\n\n  The album's title track. This song should be recognized by everybody today. It is, indeed, one of The Beatles major hits, and the song is adored by every Beatles fan. An awesome song.\n\nTHE NIGHT BEFORE\n\n  I love this song.

Gotta love that flute towards the end of the song.\n\nI NEED YOU\n\n  Not bad.\n\nANOTHER GIRL\n\n  This is another one of my favorite songs. My favorite scene in the movie is where they are singing this, where Paul McCartney has a girl pose like a bass, as he acts like he is strumming on her.\n\nTICKET TO RIDE\n\n  I never use to be fond of this song until I found the song growing on me. This song was one of their greatest, and it would later be covered by The Carpenters.\n\nACT NATURALLY\n\n  Another song sung by Ringo.

{"text":"Danger Days is a concept album:  it throws us into the badlands of a post-apocalyptic wasteland right from the start.  While there are stand-alone songs, the whole of Danger Days weaves the Mad Max concepts in & out.  Between tracks we get a DJ host named \"Dr. Death\".  Dr. Death's tongue-in-cheek news, weather & traffic reports are reminiscent of Fallout 3's \"ThreeDog\" and Iggy Pop's \"Angry Bob\" (from the cyberpunk film \"Hardware\").\n\nIf there's one thing different here for My Chemical Romance it's the addition of keyboards--\"Sing\" and \"Planetary (GO!)\" are good examples of how a song can still be high-energy and original even with a synth background.  The songs that stand out as 'hit' material are more accessible than their earlier work: while The Black Parade was a bit more appealing for existing MCR fans,  you could easily hear \"Bulletproof Heart\", \"Gravity\", and \"Planetary (GO!)\" on the radio and that wouldn't be a bad thing.  Ballads like \"S\/C\/A\/R\/E\/C\/R\/O\/W\" and the shout-punk \"Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)\" are pure pop guilty pleasure.\n\nI thought Danger Days would just be a fun album to listen to from time to time; instead I've been pleasantly surprised at the enjoyable sounds they're broadcasting for us in Danger Days, from their own vision of a blasted land.","classification":5,"fold":0}

In addition, the groups wildly successful debut single was co-written by Paul Simon (who was living in London at the time) and Bruce Woodley of The Seekers.

{"text":"It's been just short of 4 years since the Funk Doc last released a solo album, and the Brick City native returns with his 7th major solo.  On top of that, over the years he has been a part of 4 or so group albums and a large handful of mixtapes.  Flash back just about 20 year ago when Redman broke into the rap scene and started a name for himself, a name and persona that would build over the years and eventually lead him to well-known and respected veteran status in the rap game, and breaking that fame into the TV and movie world.  This hear, being his 7th album, compared to his others, I'd have to say it's toward the bottom; but don't get any ideas that it means the album isn't quality.  Compared to his other releases, he's done better work, but this album still is worthy of a strong 4 star rating.  Here is my ratings of his other solo albums:\n\n\"Whut: Thee Album\" (1992) --- 4 stars\n\"Dare iz a Darkside\" (11\/94) - 4.5 stars\n\"Muddy Waters\" (12\/96) --- 4.5 stars\n\"Doc's Da Name\" (12\/98) --- 4.5\/4 stars\n\"Malpractice\" (5\/01) ---  4.5\/4 stars\n\"Red Gone Wild\" --- (3\/07) --- 4\/4.5 stars\n\nOn top of those I have 4 group albums he's been a Part of (Def Squad's \"El Nino\" from 6\/98, and 3 albums with Method Man: \"Blackout!\" 1 & 2 and the \"How High Soundtrack\"), plus he has put out a decent amount of quality mixtapes over the years as well. This one has 13 songs; 1 is a Classic, 1 or maybe 2 that I'd skip over, the other 10-11 are good or real good songs.  Guests are on 6 of the 13 tracks, and are mostly his normal guests from the old crew; 4 songs they are rapping on and the other 2 they provide the chorus.

{"text":"The music of OMD has given me joy for many, many years, so I was thrilled to get this \"comeback\" album and find that it had the same magical vibe as their older, classic material. So much so, that this album could bookend any of the ones that they put out in the early 1980s and it would sound, and feel, perfectly right.\n\nThis CD truly is electro-pop bliss! Many catchy songs, and a few that could inspire you to hit the dance floor, but OMD also still have that a darker, creative edge that colors other tunes. But rest assured, when these guys want to write songs with hooks, they know how to do it, and they still are doing it very well. A great sounding return to form.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"The music is provided by DJ Premier. That's a beat check. Royce Da 5-9 also gets a verse check for his raps, though it must be said that his overdramatic vocal inflections and juvenile bravado do have the tendency to irritate. He was better when he used to just rap; his prime actually ended several years ago, shortly after his 1999 Bad Meets Evil debut; but, however diminished, his skills are decidely better than average.\n\nThe one big flaw here, aside from the \"PRhyme\" concept itself, is the hooks. That's a song-dooming weakness for most MCs and Royce; this is and should be marketed as a solo album; is no exception. Even Premier's scratch samples come across as a stale, sometimes corny, novelty. This is vintage hip-hop for whatever that's worth, Premier virtually guarantees it, but that's never enough when it comes to making good songs.\n\nmarcellee.com","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"I'm by no means a Jackson 5 fanatic. I enjoy their music very music, but before buying this CD box, all I owned was a 2-disc compilation of J5 hits on CD. But the idea of a \"rarities\" album caught my fancy, so I took the splurge and ordered this one. I can honestly say that it meets, and even exceeds, my expectations. Great packaging (I don't have a turntable any longer, but the bonus 45 record is a cool extra) and the booklet is packed with ultra groovy photos of those fun, bygone bellbottom-wearing yesterdays. But the real treat is the music itself; track after track of really good songs. These songs are overflowing with the sort of musical joy and pleasure that the Jackson 5 were so adept at making.\n\nAs I said before, I'm not a diehard fan or collector, so I can't vouch for the rarity value of these tracks, but the quality is certainly very high. As others have noted, most all of these songs could have\/should have been included on previous J5 albums and many would have been big hits too. This stuff is that good. When I hear songs as catchy and joyful as \"Someone's Standing In My Love Light\" or After You Leave Girl,\" or an inspired cover of a song such as \"Up On The Roof,\" it reminds me of those magical times in the late 1960s and early 1970s when listening to the music of this group was so much fun. The same spirit can be found in this 2-CD set. Well done!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":0}

This song takes the issue head on, in an emotional heartfelt song that speaks for itself through its words. Sure the music might be a little to upbeat for the topic, but that problem is fixed on the Bedlight For Blue Eyes' cover of the song on Punk Goes 90's.\n\nBut overall, the modern standard on tackling tough issues through music. The lyrics speak volumes, and succeed where so many other songs like this fail. Maybe it's because the singer had first-hand experience with the subject (a friend who committed suicide), but the emotion shows. Again, an excellent song.","classification":5,"fold":0}
{"text":"Hearing the four man crew from Queensbridge, The Lost Boyz, once again brings back nostalgic memories of the golden age of hip hop music. Mr. Cheeks, Freaky Tah (R.I.P.), Spigg Nice, and Pretty Lou knew the formula to making good music, with most concepts working. With many dope recognizable singles such as \"Music Makes Me High\", \"Renee\", and \"Lex, Coups...\" (there is a remix floating out there I strongly recommend you hear). But what separates this crew from other groups is personalty. Mr. Cheeks is very charismatic on the microphone, and Freaky Tah plays the background vocals (those unfamiliar, think of him being what Flava Flav is to Chuck D in Public Enemy, only more serious).\n\nOne reason that makes this album great is their creative hooks, some of them will have you remembering for a while. \"Music Makes Me High\", and \"The Yearn\" are both entertaining (although I believe \"Da Game\" is very similar to the latter song). \"1,2,3\" is another great song too with the late Freaky Tah on the solo. \"Get Up\" is another song to easily remember, and slightly changes the atmosphere on the album. Other dope tracks to check out are the title song, and \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless\".\n\nThis album is great for the '95\/'96 era and can easily stack up to the many east coast hip hop albums that came out around that time. The album flows great, and I personally believe many fans will enjoy. The lyrics are definitely on point majority of the album.

{"text":"\"Restless Ones\" is another good album by the Heartless Bastards. Like their previous albums, this is consistent and solid both musically and lyrically, delivering a pretty satisfying alt-rock roster of tunes. While there isn't any new ground broken here, the Bastards have a trademark sound mostly due to the unique vocal delivery of singer\/songwriter Erika Wennerstrom - a blend of punk, rock, and a touch of country, even using steel guitar a bit over the years.\n\nWhile I don't think there's anything spectacular that jumps out at you, the group lays down some satisfying unique rock with a strong and sometimes anthem-like presence. I have to admit to gravitating toward groups that are male dominant, being male, but I definitely crave good female singers, and appreciate variety and fine musicianship, whomever it may be. The Bastards deliver on those counts. The last song on the album should have been left out, but the rest is quite solid.\n\nI do find it unfortunate that the graphic design used in designing the cd package resulted in most of the printed copy not being legible. Rule #1 in graphic design is function first. The purpose is to communicate and inform, so this is a bit puzzling - a small matter, but a dis-service to the cd format. The music is good and strong, so give the Heartless Bastards a spin.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Already, I-Empire is one of the best albums of the year (if not THE best).  Of all the CD's I've listened to this year, this one, by far, is very optimistic and uplifting, to say the least.  The anthemic, 80's synth-pop, stadium-rock sound works very well here.  And if it does sound formulaic, so be it!  Very heartfelt and inspirational too!  Tom DeLonge has definitely come a long way from his Blink-182 days, and I'm all the more glad for it!  Instead of the usual bratty, toilet humor, we get mature, \"reach for the sky\" sentiments, that is, keep going, no matter what happens to you in life.  Honestly, I think that's what we need more nowadays.  By the way, forget about that Rolling Stone critic who gave this fine CD only 2 1\/2 stars.  According to the review, \"Blink-182 guitarist is all grown up and synth-poppy.  But is that a good thing?\"  I certainly think so!\n\n** ADDENDUM **\nAngels & Airwaves' new album, LOVE, is already available as a FREE download.

{"text":"Wow--22 five-star reviews so far, and one four-star.  The Train fans are out in full force, and quite early.  I'm really glad that I was able to stream this album first, because otherwise I would have felt completely ripped off.  All in all, while this isn't the worst Christmas album I've ever heard, it's certainly not all that good.  The vocals are all over the place--by the third song, I was hoping for a new vocalist to take over.  They seem to have been done rather quickly, with few if any retakes, and to be honest, I don't feel that the lead vocalist has the vocal qualities to maintain interest for more than ten or fifteen minutes, much less an entire album.  The music behind him is competent, of course, but nothing at all special--it, too, sounds like it was done rather quickly.  Christmas albums are often like that--groups don't spend nearly as much time rehearsing or recording them.  The bottom line is that for every standard on here, I have four of five versions that are much better than these.  For the new songs, there was nothing that made me take notice, nothing that I felt I really wanted to hear again.  It's a standard pop album, with somewhat Christmasy lyrics, and nothing special that I'll look forward to keeping.","classification":2,"fold":0}

{"text":"With so many artists retreading their catalogs with concert performances of classic albums, Stephen Stills' career-spanning live set provides a different proposition. Rather than take his audience back to a single point in time, he takes them on the musical journey he mapped out for himself with Buffalo Springfield, CSN(&Y), Manassas, and various solo releases. The set list focuses primarily on the years 1966 through 1973, but reaches to Stills' last solo album, 2005's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Man-Alive\/dp\/B000A7Q1YW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Man Alive!<\/a>&nbsp;for \"Wounded World\" (segued here with Joe Walsh's \"Rocky Mountain Way\") and draws in a cover of Tom Petty's recent Mudcrutch song \"Wrong Thing to Do.\"\n\nThe show is split into solo acoustic and electric band sets, and rather than following a strict timeline, Stills has arranged the songs into a program that makes for a good show, with crowd-pleasing favorites placed strategically among the deeper album cuts. The solo tunes show Stills to still be a powerful acoustic picker (both finger and flat-pick), and though his singing voice is rough in spots, the song introductions and storytelling are incredibly engaging. Best of all, the disc provides generous helpings of between-song continuity and gives you a good sense of how the show felt as a whole. This is a document of a live concert performance rather than a cleanly edited set of live songs.\n\nThe show kicks off with \"Tree Top Flyer,\" a 1968 solo tune that didn't appear on a commercial release until CS&N tackled it fifteen years later. Fan favorites \"4+20\" and \"Change Partners\" bracket a touching version of the Manassas tune \"Johnny's Garden,\" and a couple of covers, Dylan's \"Girl From the North Country\" and the traditional \"Blind Fiddler\" show off some of Stills' own favorites. The acoustic set closes with a 9-minute rendition of \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\" that shows off Stills' blistering guitar skills, and provides a transition to the electric band set. The second set opens with the little heard \"Isn't It About Time,\" from the second Manassas album, and unlike the chestnuts that follow, the arrangement and performance sound very fresh as Stills adds some meaty Stratocaster playing.\n\nThe Buffalo Springfield numbers are a mixed bag. They're stretched into jams that give Stills an opportunity to show that his guitar can reach heights that his voice can't always follow. \"Rock & Roll Woman\" retains its passion, \"Bluebird\" is reworked enthusiastically to fit Stills' limited vocal range, but a bluesy 7-minute version of \"For What It's Worth\" can't muster the vocal pungency of 1966, despite its on-going political relevance. Overall, Stills sounds more enthusiastic about the material that's newer to him, including his own \"Wounded World\" and the Petty and Walsh covers.\n\nThe widescreen DVD offers the same track line-up as the CD, though with the option of DTS Surround. The only extras are a short intro clip by Stills and credit-roll clips in which Stills discusses the set list. The lighting and videography are excellent, giving viewers a chance to see close-ups of Stills singing and picking. He sells his songs with facial expressions, postures and body movements, and his lack of vocal flexibility is more than made up for by watching him rip on guitar. This is a nicely selected mix of hits and album cuts, performed with the freedom of someone with nothing left to prove. CD and DVD discs are packaged in a three-panel cardboard slipcase.

This song should have been longer with some sort of instrumental solo in the middle and at the end fading away slowly in conjunction with the other instruments. None the less I like this type of song from Nelly. I've been a fan off Nelly since she started in the late 90's. I was in high school and normally listened to rock music like Guns N' Roses, Metalica, Aerosmith, Pink Floyd etc. I hated when she changed to more \"dirty\" type music. But she had to grow up and wish she would make more of this types of songs. This is more classy Nelly and I like a well orchestrate song with melodies.

The song was played on local radio and I remember the song being performed at a carnival that was being held near the city that I lived in at the time (I just wish that I could remember if it was Alannah Myles and her group or if the performance was by a tribute band). Anyhow, the vocals and the lyrics of the  song musically paint a story that would make for good tv episode viewing or a movie about a heartbreaker who is easy on the eyes or maybe not conventionally attractive but a charmer.  Either way a person has to be open-minded to listen to this gem of a song due to the fact that the song appears to be about a womanizer who is easy on the eyes, maybe even pleasant to be around (I.e. a charmer) yet hard on a persons heart romantically speaking.

{"text":"When it has came down to Motown lately, many people have rediscovered the classic R&B rhythms last year with the celebration of Motown's 50th Anniversary. But, with all the celebrating, there was also tragedy with the heartbreaking death of Michael Jackson, and how much that placed a dark cloud over Motown, and the legacy of so many delightful artists of the 60's and 70's era of great R&B. That also has been said with The Commodores as well. It has been nearly 40 years since they've performed their first times together in the heart of Alabama. Since then, Lionel Richie and company have made one of the strongest impacts in pop music. Nevertheless, with all the talks of them reuniting within the past few years, that unfortunately never saw the light of day. Well, for those of us whom still want to enjoy a loving sense of what The Commodores were all about, it is right here,\n\nThe 2009 Commodores Definitive Collection, is a great retrospective of why they've been one of the most influential groups in Pop, R&B, and Funk you could even imagine in the 70's and early 80's. The collection of songs have all been remastered well, and include their biggest songs. While the collection is honestly nothing new for hard core Commodores fans, if you've purchased their 1997 Ultimate Collection, the track lising is honestly the exact same listing of songs. Nevertheless, they still sound absolutely strong including classics from the heartwarming Easy, the funky Brick House, to lesser-recognized songs like Old-Fashion Love, all the way to their classics like Zoom, Just To Be Close To You, all the way to their last big hit, Nightshift, one of the few songs after Lionel left the group for his own solo success.\n\nWhile it is so sad that The Commodores aren't together anymore, it honestly is too easy to forget how great their songs honestly were. If you've alreasy bought their 1997 Ultimate Collection, stay with that because it is the exact same collection. But, for anyone whom never experienced what it is like to hear a brick house of soul, than this would honestly be a great place to start, and that is purely easy like Sunday morning.\n\nAlbum Cover: B+\n\nSongs: B+\n\nPrice: B+\n\nRemastering: A-\n\nOverall: B+","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Splendid offering from the veteran, alt-country band.  Some groups seem to grow tired after a while and their output goes down with time. That is certainly not the case her with The Mavericks. Not only does it match some of their best early moments, the impressive level of greatness exceeds many bands half their age. There is more of a joyous, tex-mex feel to this album with mariachi horns laced through out the discs several key tunes.  The playing is tight and the tunes alive with energy. Raul Malo has always been the team leader and his voice, as they say, could read the Nashville phone book and impress Caruso. On his solo efforts he has always sounded in fine voice, but to me, those offerings, without his band mates, seem to lack some of the spark he seems to generate when the group plays together. Best of all they appear to be enjoying themselves and having fun through out this offering, which comes trough in the fine music and singing. Of the past and the present all at once. Sure they channel the 1960s, from Elvis to Orbison. Queue Ennio Morricone, a tip of the cowboy hat to Marty Robbins, a nod to The Polish Prince, a sly wink to Timi Yuro! The Mavericks take us from Marimba to Newtons Vegas to, dare I say, the Wall of Sound, seamlessly and without shame. They are all over the map and right and tight in the pocket. I loved it. Guitars & strings & trumpets collide, fold, crescendo and fade. They sound confident and conformable in their collective skin, posing as modern-day western jesters and running though a generous 14 songs. It is right up there with the best LPs Ive heard this year, and that The Mavericks have delivered.  Listening to music should never feel like a chore and thankfully on this fresh new recording, Ive looked forward to playing it multiple times without regret. Highly recommended.","classification":4,"fold":0}

How these three artisans could be together and managing to put so much praiseworthy music for even one single is difficult for me to fathom , I know this groups history , now , which really causes me to be amazed that they could sing together at all , but I am convinced that my road trip would not have seemed too short if not for this song and this 8 track tape. As bad as those players were I am still surprised at how this song\/album\/group continues to astonish me with their skill .

It was never a track on any of her albums, but was labeled more as a Jermaine Jackson song. The keyboard and accompanying instrumental work on this is definitive of the time period  and is an aspect of music that is sorely missed in the contemporary market; remastering really does it justice. Probably sweeter than her Bodyguard work, but not as maudlin as things such as \"All at once\".

{"text":"If any song could be a \"signature\" song for Al Hirt it's Java, originally released on his great \"Honey In the Horn\" album in the early 60's. The song by his old New Orleans friend Alan Toussaint  shows off his distinctive sound and style.\n\nIn the early 90's I got to meet Al Hirt briefly at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. He was part of an interview series. His interview was unusual as he aired his feelings about the IRS and business deals gone bad between his reminisces of career and thoughts on Jazz. There was a lot more to him than just music.\n\nWhen he recorded \"Honey in the Horn\" (his his most classic album) he was at the peak of his form. My parents played it on our old Blaupunkt stereo console that was as big as a steamer trunk. It is a classic indeed and a standard of that time.\n\nSound quality for Java and the whole album is, of course, typical of the time and analog recording technology. For me this gives it a little bit of a nostalgic feel. Al Hirt's performances stand the test of time. He is a New Orleans original and Java is a great example of his art.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Musiq Soulchild has been one of the more consistent R&B\/Neo-Soul singers of the last decade. And the reason for that is probably beccause he has a neo-soul style, but he incorporates contemporary R&B touches into his music as well, where as most neo-soul singers stick to that sub genre, Musiq knows how to balance the two extremely well. And Musiqinthemagiq is just another continuation of his already bolstering discography. While the album is definitely far from his best, it's still a typical Musiq album for the most part. The only really big change in style on this album is that he works with some brand new producers that he's never worked with before. There's not one producer on this album that's produced on any of his other albums. Which is a gift and a curse kind of. I always liked the producers he worked with before, (Mainly Carvin & Ivan, and Warryn Campbell) especially when he would switch it up and throw a big name in the mix like the Underdogs or Neff U. But on Musiqinthemagiq, he switches it up completely by enlisting a completely new crew of producers, Jerry Wonda being the executive producer. Because of this, Musiqinthemagiq does have a different style than his previous albums, Musiq himself called this album his most radio friendly album to date and most commercial record. And while part of that is true, due to songs like the funky first single \"Anything\" and the mid tempo contemporary track \"Single\", or the mid tempo banger \"Backtowhere\" which could have been on any Trey Songz or Chris Brown album, the album still has the genuine gentleman R&B feel that all of his previous albums do. There is still plenty of vintage Musiq on this album, like the mid tempo ode to marriage \"Sayido\", which reminds me a lot of \"Teachme\". Or \"Befriends\" also has the vintage neo-soul sound that Musiq fans have come to love. But what keeps this album from being a true stand out, is that while there is a fair amount of good material on the album, towards the end of the album it starts to drag, and the lack of ANY big name producers becomes more and more evident as the album drags on, the songs almost start to blend together, making it hard to distinguish what songs are the keepers and what ones are the duds. With a little more focus, and maybe some better production, this could have been one of his better albums, but in the end it ended up just being solid... nothing amazing or mind blowing, but a solid addition to his discography... if you liked any of his previous albums, you will get enjoyment out of this one as well, just don't expect anything as good as Juslisen or even Luvanmusiq for that matter...","classification":3,"fold":0}

The beat selection and pace of the album was impeccable\n3. The album was quite fluid in sound\n4.

{"text":"Being a new age music journalist for over 30 years as well as a music producer myself who has worked on a number of guided meditation recordings, I can say that, in my experience, Meditations2Go are some of the best I've heard. The series is the work of Rob Brookler, who has been a meditation teacher in the Los Angeles area for 28 years Having worked with many groups and individuals in that time, he draws from real life experience and has created a practical approach to not only focusing the mind, but on gaining insight into many of the issues that are prevalent in our day to day lives. In addition to the audio meditations, his website also offers a wealth of well-written articles that offer guidance for a variety of personal challenges and life learning. While these are presented as a supplement to the meditations and embody many of the principles found within, they can be quite helpful in their own right, and the fact that they are available to read free of charge speaks to the positive intention and goodwill of Rob and his site\n\nOne of the things that impressed me the most about Meditations2Go is how well produced and professional they are. A standout feature for me is Rob's voice. His tone and timbre, as well as his pacing and cadence are about as perfect as you could want for something of this nature. He also has a wonderful ear for the kind of music that is best suited for each topic, and will even spend time in the studio with the soundtrack producer during the recording process to help tailor it for the particular meditation. Needless to say, I am very impressed with Meditations2Go and am greatly enjoying and benefiting from integrating their soothing ambience and insightful narratives into my life.","classification":5,"fold":0}
{"text":"Over four albums, Grace Potter & the Nocturnals have passed from their folk-rock beginnings to Potter wielding her open-E-tuned Gibson Flying V through stadium-stompers rockers like Paris (Ooh La La) and The Lion the Beast the Beat.  Midnight continues this trend with Hot to the Touch, Alive Tonight, and the rebel-yell Instigators.  However, rumors are that Potter fired The Nocturnals halfway through the album, relying much more heavily on collaborative writing with producer Eric Valentine  who also played nearly all the instruments on Midnight.  This insular approach resulted in quite a number of tracks that don't sound as fully developed as they might have been with input from a fully experienced band.  The drum-machined Delirious sounds like a Gloria Estefan knockoff.  The melody of The Miner bears more than a passing resemblance to Paul McCartneys My Love.  And Your Girl is Prince without the prance.  Lyrically, nothing on Midnight carries the soulful fire of Potters biggest ballad Stars, from her previous album The Lion the Beast the Beat.  If Nobodys Born with a Broken Heart is supposed to be poetically profound, Potters romance with Valentine has clearly weakened her critical judgment as a writer.  And while Potter remains in fine voice, the diminished influence of The Nocturnals leaves Midnight a mixed bag of tricks.","classification":3,"fold":0}

Aside from the iconic Smells Like Teen Spirit song, there are other classics on Nevermind by Nirvana such As In Bloom, Come As You Are, Polly and Lithium.  One of the multiple strong qualities of Nevermind by Nirvana is the emotional honesty portrayed in some of the  life theme songs such As Lithium where the song takes the stigma of extreme depression yet turns it into A musical Art form without minimizing the whole concept behind not being Able to just simply wish Away depression And in come As you Are  which highlights expectations  in regards to peoples behavior (I Admit to Also using songfacts As A reference to help me further understand the meanings behind Lithium And Come As You Are).","classification":5,"fold":0}

Kind of like the power struggle over the bed between me, wife, and dog when we are going to sleep at night.\n\nNeil Young & Crazy Horse perform Down by the River with a loosely structured rural grace. Neil sings with a hushed confessional tone, describing how he shot her dead. The ol murder ballad. 'He had to do it, she was shooting her mouth off about his mom.' Oops, that's Crispin Glover in River's Edge. Both are about a river and a murder. Perhaps Neil was a young Feck. If you haven't seen River's Edge, I sorry for you.\n\nWhen Neil isn't singing, he's choking out all sorts of primal electric sounds on his guitar. Love those one note solos! 1:52...then at\n\n3:22 he lays down this amazing lick. Guitars trade some great stabbing chords for a bit, then an even crazier one\/two note solo starts up at 3:56. Neil at his electric best: cutting loose in his idiosyncratic way, no rules, working out all the subtle nuances of one note until he feels it's ok to move on to a different one. Then having little spasms of fast-picked chaos.\n\nI just love Neil's vocal delivery. Nobody sounds like him, letting the words out of his mouth with this kind of delicate seesaw between innocence and wisdom.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"The title track to Born To Run was Bruce Springsteen's last ditch effort for superstardom.  He threw everything he had into the song and it came out as a larger than life anthem.  He wanted to recreate Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, but this wall is on steroids.  The song is a full on blast to your senses with horns, swirling organs, glockenspiels and maybe even an actual kitchen sink thrown in.  The song was released in advance of the album and made a respectable showing of #23 on the Billboard Hot 100.  It marked the only appearance of drummer Ernest \"Boom\" Carter on a studio track by Mr. Springsteen and the last appearance of keyboardist David Sancious for almost twenty years when he ended up playing on a couple of Human Touch tracks.","classification":5,"fold":0}

The siren voices of this group remind me strongly of \"Destiny's Child\", when they first took off with such a bang, and the lyrics are just so beautiful. Everyone who has ever come away from a broken or difficult relationship will ache for the singer whose damaged heart needs healing, and who worries that the pain of her past relationship might seep over and poison her new one - can her new love be patient and help her to heal?\n\nLike all Amazon MP3 downloads, this MP3 is DRM-free and plays beautifully, without fuss on my MP3 player.\n\n~ Ana Mardoll","classification":5,"fold":0}

The melodic nature of the vocals is also rather pleasant, giving a nice edge to the track.

{"text":"Isaac Hayes' classic soundtrack to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Shaft\/dp\/0790743752\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Shaft<\/a>&nbsp;hasn't exactly been hard to find. The original double-album topped the Billboard chart, spun off a #1 Grammy- and Oscar-winning single, and ended up the biggest seller in Stax history. It's been reissued more than a half-dozen times on CD, and more recently it's been available for electronic download. So why another reissue, why now? Primarily because the Stax catalog has come under the control of Concord Records, and the label is, understandably, producing a new round of reissues. Reissues create buzz, press coverage and garner retail space, all of which helps keep catalog evergreens in the green, and keep royalties flowing to artists and their estates.\n\nReissues also provide a chance to run a classic through updated technology, as is the case with this Bob Fisher full re-master from original analog sources. In addition, Fisher has produced a bonus mix of the title song. The new mix opens with a drumstick click track that was edited from the original, moves Charles Pitts' wah-wah guitar from right to center and deepens the tone (or simply increases the relative volume) of Willie Hall's high-hat riff. Is it a must-have? Not really, given the iconic nature of the original. The new mix is just different enough to make you wonder if something's off, but not different enough to give it a life of its own. A more compelling bonus for collectors would have been the edited, single version of the title song. Audiophiles with an earlier CD of the soundtrack may find Fisher's re-master an improvement, but casual listeners likely don't need to update.\n\nThose who've never heard the full album should give it a spin. Though the score doesn't measure up to the hook-filled catchiness of the single, it wasn't meant to. The soundtrack was written as incidental music in support of the film's action, while the theme was an expositional introduction to the film's main character. The bulk of the score is, as with most film soundtracks, instrumental texture and emotional underlining. Aside from the title theme, the only vocal tracks are \"Soulville\" and \"Do Your Thing,\" and the latter quickly evolves into a terrific 19-1\/2 minute soul jam. The instrumentals create mood that often transcends the moving images for which they were written. \"Ellie's Love Theme\" is a tender mix of vibes and horns, \"Caf Regio's\" sports a breezy West Coast Jazz feel, and \"Be Yourself\" has a strong, funky party beat. The score is music worth hearing apart from its role within the film.\n\nHayes brought his musical ethos to the project, but didn't set out to record the sort of genre-busting explorations of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Hot-Buttered-Soul\/dp\/B0028NSE3M\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hot Buttered Soul<\/a>. The longer tracks find compelling funk and soul grooves, but weren't meant to push directly into the spotlight. Those looking for an album full of \"Theme from Shaft\" radio hits will be disappointed, but those seeking a helping of Hayes' genius as a composer, arranger, orchestrator, band leader and conductor will enjoy the soundtrack presented here. Even better, Hayes recorded the film soundtrack at MGM in Los Angeles and then re-recorded the soundtrack album at Stax in Memphis for better sound. Other great blaxploitation soundtracks would follow, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Superfly\/dp\/B00000342V\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Superfly<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Across-110th-Street\/dp\/B0007YNRTK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Across 110th Street<\/a>, but Shaft remains a primal inspiration.

{"text":"Unlike some high profile R&B artist, I will never get tired of buying a Musiq album. Each one has a different vibe. It is perfect that he has decided to drop another album to kick off the summer. \"Musiqinthemagiq\" comes just in time for the summer cookouts and family reunions.\n\nFirst off Musiq is under a new management team. It may seem like boring news, but this has changed the style from what you are used to hearing from a Musiq album. Gone are long time collaborators Wayne Campbell, JR Totem & Orthodox Ransum. In are producers like August Rigo, The Element & Jesse Wilson. The problem with working with new producers is it takes time to gel. Songs like \"Silver&Gold\" takes Musiq in a place he doesn't need to be. \"Lovecontract\" has a weird Rapheal Saadiq sound. The lead single \"Anything\" gets the party started. This album is less on the slow jams (There are none) and heavy on dance grooves. \"Waitingstill\" is the closest to a slow song. The Jesse Wilson produced, \"Donthaveto\" is the gem of this album. It starts a trio of no skip songs including the beautifully written \"Bestfriend\" and \"Yes\".\n\nMusiq has always has always been able to find a good medium between slow grooves and mid tempo songs. The lack of slow jams makes this album not as good as his last two. I rank this somewhere between \"Soulstar\" and \"Juslisen\". This album takes it back to his early \"Aijuswenasing\" days. As a long time Musiq fan, I enjoyed this album. A couple of his classic slow songs would have been nice. But overall I am not disappointed. I think there is no doubt that Musiq has been the most consistent male R&B artist over the past 10 years.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nWhile a great deal of my music library is comprised of Amazon's free songs, I splurged and spent a whopping 69 cents on this one.  Thats right...Amazon has a FREEBIE \/ CHEAP section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies or really good digital music deals (69 cent songs, $5 albums!), you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Departments (drop down menu) --> Digital and Prime Music -->Deals --> Songs by Price \/ Albums by Price (on left side of screen)","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Rhino Records which has already released a dozen of Chicago's first albums as enhanced re-issues, has put out this 20 song offering.  Chicago : What's It Gonna Be Santa\" is a re-issue of \"Chicago XXV\" , a superb contemporary collection of Christmas classics with a Chicago original mixed in. This new release however, adds six newly recorded tracks to the 14 on Chicago XXV, making an already good thing even better.\n\nThe original selection of Christmas tunes is simply terrific. Chicago, following in the approach of \"Night and Day Big Band\" wherein the American supergroup re-arranged big band classics with an inventive and fresh variety of styles, tempos and grooves, takes a similar artistic path with their Christmas release.\n\nSuch holiday standards as \"White Christmas\" and \"The Christmas Song\" are done in an uptempo pop-funk style while \"Let It Snow!\" shows off Chicago's ability to really rock in a blues shuffle groove. Bill Champlin's soulful \"Have Yourself a Merry Little\" Christmas\" gives this moody classic a wonderfully original blues treatment. And, throughout the disc, the legendary Chicago horns play through trombonist Jimmy Pankow's melodic arrangements in their unique, warm and fat style.\n\nThe six new tracks really compliment the original CD, adding even more new styles and sounds. The disc's opener, Bobby Lamm's \"Winter Wonderland\" lays down an infectious rock groove with excellent vocal arrangements making great use of Chicago's arsenal of superb vocalists. Lead guitarist Keith Howland who covers some tunes in concert, shows off his first studio lead vocal with a quick tempo pop rock version of \"Jolly Old Saint Nicholas\". Bassist Jason Scheff's tenor has never sounded better than on \"This Christmas\", which has a wonderful 70's soul retro sound with the Chicago horns propelling the arrangement. Bill Champlin again shows why he is probably the greatest blue-eyed soul singer around with a gutsy, funky \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\". It sounds like an odd combination, but this track really works.\n\nFollowing up to his terrific arrangement of \"Let It Snow!\", trumpeter Lee Loughnane pens a superb shuffle version of \"Sleigh Ride\". Again, he steps behind the microphone to tackle lead vocal duties and his deep voice, reminiscent of the late Terry Kath's depth and timbre lends itself perfectly to this classic.\n\n\"Chicago: What's It Gonna Be Santa\" is just terrific and certainly one of the most inventive and eclectic holiday CD's by any artist. There's something for everyone here to enjoy.\n\nEssential holiday listening as well as essential Chicago.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Yes, it's definitely worth the money.  Why?  1. It has all 42 known recordings.  2. It is a much better sound than the remastering King Of The Delta Blues Singers (1 & 2).  Just compare Terraplane Blues and hear what happens on the KOTDBS when Johnson hits the high notes - chain saw - unnngghh my ears!  3. It leaves the previous box sets in the dust sonically.  4. It has an updated history 5.  The tracks seem to be in their correct order now as far as alternate takes go. eg. Come On In My Kitchen.  I also purchased a collection called Steady Rolling Man about 10 years ago which has all 42 recordings, it's clean but not remastered.  The Centennial Collection is definitely the most improved set out there.  I think people who say \"Not another one\" don't get it.  As the technology improves, so will the RJ recordings.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"May 12th, 1974 marks the band's only appearance in the state of Montana. The was the second show of the first tour to feature the Wall Of Sound with the first show a couple of nights earlier at the University of Nevada. The Reno show experienced a heavy wind storm known as a Washoe Zephyr which blew the speakers around and had the band fearing for their safety.\n\nThe show opens with a muscular version of Bertha although it does take a minute for the mix to get dialed in. Me And My Uncle feels right at home in \"Big Sky Country\". Loser and Black-Throated Wind are nice versions. Next up is the second live version of Scarlet Begonias which falls into a nice and upbeat early version of It Must Have Been The Roses. The western feel continues with great versions of Jack Straw, Tennessee Jed, Mexicali Blues, Deal, Big River and Brown-Eyed Women. The first set ends with a great Playing In The Band that has a great jam despite missing the return back into the song.\n\nThe second set opens with the then new, U.S. Blues and is followed by a nice El Paso. Row Jimmy is simply gorgeous. The band then launches into outer space again with a phenomenal version of Weather Report Suite. The Dark Star that comes out of Weather Report simply rips apart the fabric of time and space. This gives way to China Doll. The band rock the set to a close with hot versions of Promised Land and Not Fade Away->Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad. Unfortunately, before the encore, someone in the crowd threw a beer stein at the stage and it hit Bobby in the head. The band rock the encore with a blazing One More Saturday Night.","classification":5,"fold":0}
{"text":"Call me crazy but this is some of their best work since Animosity. I enjoyed Black Out The Sun but it had a few weaker tracks. On Kill The Flaw every track is strong. Not only that but the album has a great atmosphere and many tracks will grow on you after many listens. The title track alone will blow you away. When is the last time they made a melody that incredible? Blending the heavy with the melodic is what Sevendust is known for and I feel like they really nailed it on this record.\n\nEven though some of the tracks on here are \"radio ready\" tunes, they have such amazing hooks that you can't deny there's not many rock groups that do it better than Sevendust. That's how underrated they are. Many tracks on here should be #1 rock hits. Not that good music makes it to the radio all the time but I'm sure you get my point. These are genuine and sincere songs, not pretentious radio hits. Sevendust is a hard working and humble band that's been in the game for 2 decades and they deserve all their success and more.\n\n Lajon's raw vocal ability is showcased here once again and there's also more guitar solos and killer riffs all across the album. This is some of their most focused and inspired work in awhile. 5\/5.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"AZ (Anthony Cruz) continues to deliver the heat with his latest album \"A.W.O.L.\" (2005). The first real standout for me is \"Never Change\" a cut where AZ reflects about a friend who died, delivering some memorable lyrics and a premium chorus. Wu-Tang's Raekwon and Ghostface then drop in for a solid collaboration repping their city \"New York\". Backed by a crazy beat, AZ rhymes with hunger on \"Still Alive\". My current favorite is \"City Of Gods\", AZ shines rhyming well and laces this one with another impressive chorus. One of the things I have always liked about AZ is he remains genuine. Half-A-Mil was murdered a few years ago, AZ brings him back for the sad and heartfelt \"Street Life\" feat. Begetz. AZ then tells a short \"Bedtime Story\" remembering past years. It's nice to see AZ getting the production he deserves, Premo hooked AZ up for \"The Come Up\" and AZ shines again. Not a Bounty Killer fan, so not feeling \"Envious\", while the title track is solid. The bonus material is decent, good to that CL Smooth is still around feeling \"Magic Hour\". I recently heard another new excellent AZ track called \"Game of Life\", wish that one had been included on this release. For years people have slept on AZ's music, I don't know if that will continue, I do highly recommend checking out \"A.W.O.L.\".","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"This is the second career-spanning box set collection from The Beach Boys.  The first was 1993's 30th Anniversary 5-CD collection,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Good-Vibrations-Thirty-Years-Of-The-Beach-Boys\/dp\/B000002UR4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Good Vibrations: Thirty Years Of The Beach Boys<\/a>.  Now, to celebrate the group's 50th Anniversary, Capitol\/EMI\/Universal Music have put together this elaborately packaged 6-CD box set.  This collection is exactly what a box set should be - a good balance between familiar hits (for the average fan) and unissued rarities and alternate mixes (for the collector).  The sound quality is far superior to the GOOD VIBRATIONS box, because the former used mostly mono mixes, while most of the tracks on the new set are in stereo.  CD remastering technology has also come a long way in 20 years.  An all-rarities box set may be fine for hard-core collectors, but will put off the average listener, and there is no reason to produce an all-hits box set, because you are asking fans to repurchase songs that they already own many times over, just for the sake of fancy packaging.\n\nThe box is a leatherette package that resembles a high-school yearbook of the 1960s, with plenty of archival photos and reminiscences from The Boys (including the late Dennis and Carl Wilson).\n\nI enjoyed the rare outtakes and live performances.  I'm glad that \"Do It Again\" is finally available in true stereo; I wish the compilers had used the 2012 stereo mixes of \"I Get Around,\" \"Help Me, Rhonda,\" and \"Good Vibrations,\" but I guess that Brian didn't want them.

{"text":"Type O is one of my favorite bands, and their album \"October Rust\" is my all-time favorite album. For a band with such a self-deprecating sense of humor and such a choppy musical history, Type O Negative creates powerful, emotional music that transcends the goth stereotypes it wallows in (and helped create). And Peter Steele's dark vocals, once sort of a gimmick, have become integral to their brooding sound.\n\nAnyway, like I said, \"October Rust\" is the best album ever. But the follow-up, \"World Coming Down\", was rather disappointing. I was losing hope for the band when their last album, \"Life Is Killing Me\", turned out to be a significant improvement. While not as uniformly brilliant as \"Rust\", it had some excellent songs and brought back their sense of humor. So I had high hopes for the newest release, \"Dead Again\".\n\nThe album is surprising in a lot of ways. First of all, many of the songs are much faster than previous Type O material. Peter doesn't sing quite so deep and gloomy this time around, and guitarist Kenny Hickey does much more singing than before. A few songs break the ten-minute mark, something they haven't really done since their first record. And while much of their sound remains typically Type O, many of the lyrics deal with new themes and ideas.\n\nAccording to recent interviews, Peter Steele has returned to his Catholic upbringing, and so much of the album deals with Christianity and religion. \"The Profit of Doom\" uses an asteroid striking the Earth as a metaphor for the Apocalypse. \"These Three Things\" deals with abortion and the Jewish state of Israel. \"An Ode To Locksmiths\" offers a rather twisted version of Genesis. \"Halloween in Heaven\" is a bit lighter in tone, dealing with all the dead great musicians playing a concert in Heaven. And as usual, some of the songs are simply about Peter Steele himself and his personal problems. The title track \"Dead Again\" is about drug addiction, and \"Some Stupid Tomorrow\" deals with his anger management issues.\n\nThankfully, their sense of humor has not disappeared or been overwhelmed by the serious subject matter. I laughed out loud at some of the song titles, such as \"Tripping A Blind Man\" and \"Some Stupid Tomorrow,\" and several songs have some hilarious lines. Among my favorites:\n\n\"I had no pulse last time I checked \/ I'd trade my life for self-respect\" (from \"Dead Again\")\n\n\"Elvis ain't dead, so he isn't here\" (from \"Halloween in Heaven\")\n\n\"If only I'd known how cool death is \/ I'd have killed myself sooner\" (from \"Halloween in Heaven\")\n\nAnd let's not forget their album liner notes. The band photo from Life Is Killing Me featured four sets of feet with toe tags on them. Not to be outdone, Dead Again shows a picture of four mangled chalk outlines opposite photos of skeletons inside coffins. And in the section for equipment used, it says \"Type O Negative has yet to learn how to use the following equipment.\" I always get a kick out of that sort of thing.\n\nEven though I think \"Life Is Killing Me\" had some better individual songs than \"Dead Again\", I think \"Dead Again\" is a better album as a whole.  The whole tone of the album sounds more concise and uniform.  But that's just me.  It is a bit on the long side, but that's my only real complaint.\n\nAs a whole, fans of Type O should be happy with this release. The band they know and love has clearly matured over the years, but their style is undeniably intact. However, some people might be put off by the religious content of many of the songs. People bravely hoping for a return to \"October Rust\" territory will surely be disappointed as well. That era is gone, folks.","classification":4,"fold":0}

The inconsistency runs throughout the track leaving me thankful its over, astonished at the attempt  and not happy with the end result.\n\nAt 72, she still has pipes, unlike most of her peers.

{"text":"There are some songs that are just meant to be covered, where in this case there are some songs that had been worth sampling over time. When Ray Parker Jr. came out with the original Ghostbusters theme song, it was caught under innuendo and storms, with him using the Huey Lewis & The News song, I Wanna New Drug back in the 80's. But with time and space, the song has still been as iconic today, as it became a hit back then. When I had heard Fall Out Boy do a cover of this definitive song, Ray Parker Jr. & Huey Lewis got credit for in the 80's, and the original version isn't bad after all this time. It is definitely one of those movie songs that has still stood the test of time, in the way other movies songs like Purple Rain did for with the late great Prince and Footloose for Kenny Loggins as well. It surprisingly still shows a lot of longevity that is worth listening to, and much more worth the download for new fans of the upcoming Ghostbusters remake, and die hard fans of the classic films with Bill Murray & Dan Akroyd.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":0}

His music is straight geared to the Christians and in my opinion, not really geared towards evangelism to the loss.\n\nMost of Flame's album contain great substance, sound doctrine and teaching, but how does a heathen embrace that if he doesn't know much about Christ?  Now I recommend this album to all Christians, especially Gospel Rap Artists because this album actually aims at educating those who want to be apart of the Christian Hip Hop culture.\n\nFlames lyrics really don't have much creativity to me.  One of his highest qualities of how he uses his voice articulation and enunciation is sort of missing in this album.  Nonetheless, he, as always, with the exception of \"Jesus or Nothing\", has delivered a quality Christian rap album worth more than a second listening.  I just feel him and Lecrae needs to do a duo album, because Lecrae's albums seems more geared towards the secular audience, Flame's seems more geared to the Christian audience, a duet album would create the perfect balance.

I didn't expect Cornell to go with a basically acoustic record, especially following an acoustic \"best of\" live release, so maybe it's a case of expecting a rock record from him. One can argue that we got that with the most recent Soundgarden album, but I tend to like variety not only within my music collection, but within a given album as well. Tony Iommi said it best a couple of years ago (paraphrasing), saying that he liked to include softer tunes on an album because it made the heavier tunes sound that much heavier; in other words, there was a balancing of the album thematically and sonically. I am definitely a Cornell fan, just a little let down by what sounds like a middling release to me; I realize that many have rated this a 4 or 5 star release - I could possibly see a 4, but this really isn't a 5, not by any stretch.

St. Vincent mutters creepily on the atonal-yet-pleasant \"Under Neon Lights\" as does Ali Love on \"EML Ritual\", skeletal with drops and builds. Other guests include Cate Le Bon\" on \"Born In The Echoes\", and Beck on the enchanting \"Wide Open\", sublime with eerie flourishes - the album highlight.\n\n\"Sometimes I Feel So Deserted\" is a propulsive clubby number with female vocals. \"I'll See You There\" sounds like a prog rock instrumental with squalling guitar-like sounds (or perhaps the real thing distorted), while the aptly titled \"Just Bang\" reminds one a bit of Underworld's \"Born Slippy\", albeit less urgent. The futuristic \"Reflexion\" juxtaposes disembodied vocal samples with discordant sounds to charming effect. The ominous ballad \"Taste Of Honey\" has got to be the only duet I know of with a buzzing bee, while \"Radiate\" is a tender ballad setting a caressing croon to undulating wave forms which build to a futuristic choral climax, like Coldplay meet Radiohead.

{"text":"Fans who have long preferred Dylan's rebellious, folksy lyrics won't be disappointed. In a market which often pushes Christianity to the gospel music genre, Dylan steps up and gives us his best music in years.\n\"I  Believe in You,\" is the story of a person who is rejected because of  his faith but doesn't flinch. Dylan hits on a theme universal to anyone who  has believed in something intangible. Autobiographical, he sings about the  public's reaction... they wanted him to sing terribly politically incorrect  lyrics like \"just like a woman...\" when he wanted to sing about  his new found faith in Christ, equally politically incorrect.\n\"Gotta  Serve Somebody\" is witty and insightful, and has a great urban  old-school gospel flavor to it.\n\"Man Gave Names to All the  Animals\" is a funny look at what Adam's first job was in Eden.\nI  fully recommend it.\nAnthony Trendl","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"It is with both hope and sorrow that we welcome Sevendust's seventh studio album. Sorrow, for the band has parted ways with guitarist Sonny Mayo not even a week prior to the album's release. Hope, however, that with original guitarist Clint Lowery back in the fold, that the band will stop rushing out albums so quickly and take their time to put out a stunning chapter eight.\n\nTruth is, listening to Sevendust is like getting together with old friends. There's a certain sense of comfort, of knowing what to expect. More or less, Sevendust haven't drastically altered their sound over the years. Each album has been marked with a significant growth, but not enough to turn off the fanbase. It should come as no surprise, then, that \"Chapter VII: Hope & Sorrow\" -- rushed out 13 months after \"Alpha\" -- has the band going through the motions. Usually, with two years between albums, any band can come up with something that is both satisfying and refreshing. Being the first time Sevendust have released two albums so closely together, it is also the first time they have fallen short of expectations.\n\nThat's not to say that their seventh effort is a bad one. It's a totally listenable album, especially for the faithful fan, but there is nothing here that hasn't been done already on the previous six efforts. It's got a strong start with the intense \"Inside\" -- which would make a perfect set opener for their upcoming tour -- and songs like \"Hope\" and the groovy first single, \"Prodigal Son,\" stray from the \"Alpha\" formula, turning out to be the most interesting tracks. In fact, the main problem with this album is that it's basically \"Alpha\" redux. Had they taken more time to tour with that album and record this material, we might have something a little more interesting to listen to. Then again, if they had waited, Sonny wouldn't have gotten his part in this, his closing chapter with the band. But I digress.\n\nIn an attempt to up the ante (and perhaps have a bid at rock radio success) the help of American Idol's Chris Daughtry and Alter Bridge's Miles Kennedy and Mark Tremonti is enlisted. Tremonti's contribution to \"Hope\" is definitely a highlight, but Miles and Daughtry both seem to have trouble meshing with Lajon's vocal style. These collaborations have nothing on the likes of Skin, Chino Moreno or even Aaron Lewis, and each respective singer tends to overpower their song. Definitely a downer. Overall, the album isn't terrible, nor does it have vultures circling above the band's head. It's just a slight mis-step is all. Hopefully with the original line-up intact, the next chapter in the band's story will be a more exciting one.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"So many great recordings from '69 out there, but, is their ever too much of a good thing?? I think not... Most of the songs from the not yet released Workingman's Dead appear on here as well as Me & My Uncle and others that would become staples of the live set for most of the forthcoming years. Disc 2 has a great version of Dire Wolf, Good Lovin, and a killer version of I'm A King Bee (anyone who digs the Doors version of Crawling King Snake will love this) On King Bee T.C delivers some tasty fills on the keyboard( him and Pigpen are definitely the MVP's of this release) Disc 3 is my favorite so far the segue between Alligator and Caution is alone worth the price of admission. There's a very unique version of Uncle John's Band that gets a bit exploratory, like they'd sometimes later do on Playing W. The Band. This is my favorite version of UJB (along w. the 1979 Road Trips Version) The song that follows He Was A Friend Of Mine was also covered by the Byrds and Jerry G.& the boys sound like they're channeling their inner Roger Mcguinn or Crosby Stills and Nash. This release also came w. a killer bonus disc to boot. If you love the Dead, whether or not to invest in a Dave's Picks subscription should be a no brainer.

{"text":"Much like their excellent breakthrough album No Name Face, Stanley Climbfall after many rotations has revealed itself to be another stunning effort. In Jason Wade, Lifehouse appear to have a genuinely first-rate frontman and a fine writer of melodic, literate rock songs and who at a young age seems to have mastered all the combinations of chord changes that have direct access to the heart. The sounds Lifehouse's music immerses itself with have been used so frequently in the name of such mediocrity in the post-grunge era - that perhaps the hardest thing about listening to an album like Stanley CLimbfall is finding the conviction to believe in it's greatness. Lifehouse are truly a cut above. This is an album that by turns embraces terrific monster-hooks (Wash, Am I Ever Going To Find Out, and the title track) and subtle yet glorious melodies which reward repeated listenings (The Beginning, and the wonderful bonus track How Long) which, incredibly, is actually a real bonus - not just a cast-off. This is one band that deserves all the success they can muster and I highly recommend that we contribute to bands that consistently offer quality, depth and a reaon to keep coming back for more.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"In 1958 at the age of 18 a brash young singer\/songwriter from Los Angeles named Phil Spector wrote a song called \"To Know Him Is To Love Him\". Together with three friends from high school Phil formed a group called The Teddy Bears and eventually recorded the song for the Dore label who released it as a single. Within months \"To Know Him Is To Love\" streaked to the top of the Billboard charts and remained there for three weeks. While he enjoyed performing Phil Spector's real ambition was to become a record producer. Phil moved to New York and honed his skills for a couple of years at the legendary Brill Building. While there he had a hand in making a half dozen hit records including the Ben E. King classic \"Spanish Harlem\".\n\nBen E. King was born in Henderson, NC and raised in Harlem. Ben had the great good fortune to work with the legendary vocal group The Moonglows while still in high school. He joined a doo-wop group called The Five Crowns in 1957 and they would become the new Drifters in 1959. Ben E. King can be heard singing lead on The Drifters classic \"There Goes My Baby\".\n\nAs a result of contract disputes with Drifters manager George Treadwell Ben E. King made the decision to leave the group in May 1960 to pursue a career as a solo act. It would prove to be an extremely wise decision. At the tail end of 1960 Atlantic released King's debut single on it's Atco subsidiary. \"Spanish Harlem\" would spend a total of 16 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 pop charts peaking at #10. The tune was co-written by Jerry Leiber and Phil Spector and produced by Leiber and Stoller. \"Spanish Harlem\" was ranked #358 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Songs\nof All-Time\".  This is the original hit recording.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Before HEARTTHROB, Tegan and Sara's 2009 album marked the biggest change in the band's sound.  The band's sound was much more streamlined than it had ever been before, and HEARTTHROB continues this trend.  This record is, for better or worse, more produced, more streamlined, and more electronic than anything Tegan and Sara have ever done before.  For those keeping track of these kinds of things, SAINTHOOD was a very split album: the songs penned by Sara were much more electronic and melodic (\"Alligator\", \"Night Watch,\" \"Red Belt\") and Tegan's output was more in the vein of power-pop and alternative rock (\"Hell,\" \"Northshore,\" \"The Ocean\").  This time around, the distance between these songwriters has closed, and now, it's difficult to tell who has written what.  Even though this makes for a more cohesive record in the end, it comes at the cost of the variety and surprise that many of the past records had.\n\nThe album opens with its lead single, \"Closer.\"  \"Closer\" is a good, solid, catchy tune, and it's filled with many of the twin-on-twin harmonies that has become a hallmark for the band.  The song lays the harmonies, electronic percussion, and synthesizers on nice and thick.  Chris Walla (who produced the previous two albums and guitar player for Death Cab for Cutie) has been replaced with a small handful of other producers.  Greg Kurstin picks up the bulk of the production work here - known for his work with Sia, Kylie Minogue, Pink, and Kelly Clarkson - and he definitely leaves his mark on the duo's sound.  \"Closer\" sets the tone for the rest of the album: it's heavily melodic, but underneath all of the shiny production, there's a well of heartache that Tegan and Sara have used for inspiration.\n\nFor me, this album doesn't completely work.  Before this album, I've enjoyed each new album more than the previous one.  HEARTTHROB isn't bad - it's surely better than most electronic-pop music out there - but it doesn't come close to the heights of SAINTHOOD or THE CON.  The best predictor of whether or not you'll like this album lies in your reaction to the lead single \"Closer.\"  If you loved any of the band's previous albums, you might hate this one, but you might also go crazy for it - it all depends on what you enjoyed most about the band. Either way, listen to this album a few times before making up your mind on it.\n\nRecommend tracks to sample\/download: \"Closer,\" \"How Come You Don't Want Me,\" \"Love They Say\"","classification":4,"fold":0}

His skills as a singer has continued to grow and that confidence is reflected in a series of sterling albums beginning in the late 70's when he teamed with his ex-wife Linda.\n\n\"Still\" continues the Thompson curse because, darn it, it's that good. No, not good--exceptional. It's tough when you produce albums that are varing from good to exceptional to judge something after a couple of listens.\n\nProduced by Wilco's Jeff Tweedy, \"Still\" features some of the sharpest writing that he's done in awhile.\n\nThe last song on the album allows Thompson to indulge himself and pay homage to his heroes with \"Guitar Heroes\". Other stand out tracks are \"Patty Don't You Put Me a Down\", \"Broken Doll\", \"Dungeons for Eyes\" and \"Where's Your Heart\".\n\nThe second disc in the deluxe edition features five songs produced by Thompson himself. It's a terrific disc and every bit the equal of the main album. Humor continues to be a driving element in Thompson's lyrics (and music) and is on display here with a witty, Intelligent set of lyrics (are there any other kinds with Thompson?).\n\nThe mastering for the CD improves over the last album with a slightly more dynamic presentation.\n\nIs the deluxe edition worth it? Yep.\n\nHighly recommended such is the curse of Richard Thompson.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"How many downstroked eighth and sixteenth notes on acoustic guitar can one album have? Come and see!\n\nI do love the sincerity and depth that AF strives toward, and they have some glorious moments here, lyrically most of all, but let's be honest: a lot of these tunes sound like a lot of these other tunes---almost suburbanly cookie-cutterish--- and there are precious few memorable melodies. It's all about mood, but it's mainly that one Arcade Fire mood...perhaps a distillation of their own memories of suburban angst? With each downstroke we bury thee, thoughts of impending gloom! When Month Of May shows up it seems like a punky breath of fresh air...until one realizes it's just another fest of downstroked 16th-notes, only this time on electric gits.\n\nIf I was still in my teens this might be manna from heaven, in all its ineluctable inscrutability. Honestly, I miss that period when music grabbed me by the you-know-whats and meant everything. If you're right there with this right now, god bless you: enjoy it to the hilt while you have it. At some point you'll have heard so many records that it will all blend together and that special wallop of newness will be a rare and special memory. Savor it now.\n\nI can see how this might have that for some, but for me it's all a little bit too homogeneous. Yet it's still got that sheen of unique it-ness that distinguished OK Computer and other modern classics. It doesn't quite grab me that strongly, but maybe I haven't given it enough spins yet.\n\nThe lyrics do have some sweet points (AF aren't afraid to use their brains, their greatest asset), and this could easily become an anthem for many suburban kids, emo-version 2.0, semi-beta.\n\nIt doesn't sound like anything else except the last AF album, and there's nothing wrong with that.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Ok here it is.  Yes I like the album. Barbra sounds great, her vocals are astounding and better than ever I think. However, I cant say I entirely love this album.  Everyone has an opinion and here is mine for those who care.  How many times can we hear Ms. Striesand sing People, The Way We Were, Somewhere, etc, come on enough already.  I know Barbra said she wanted a different take on the old standards, but did it really improve the songs?  AND Stevie Wonder singing People, I didn't like it.  Other misfires were her duet with Blake Sheldon. Not a good match.  Love Me Tender, with Elvis was a disappointment. The arrangements were just not enough for her.  She deserves more, better than this.  I love Josh Groban but their duet just didn't click for some reason like it should have or as well as it did on her duets album.  I could name a few more disappointments but I will move on to what I did like.  It Had To Be You with Michael Buble is fantastic, right up Barbras alley, beautiful sound, big band harmony and just the right amount of fun. Great mix there. Sounded like a Patrick Williams arrangement.  I enjoyed Billy Joel too, but I do prefer their solo efforts better.  Come Rain and Come Shine was a surprise, John Mayer kept up with Barbra very nicely.  This is Barbars album that is very clear.  It goes to show that the new talent cant hold a candle to that of the past, they try but just cant keep up.  Barbra enough with the old hits, lets move on to some classy stuff you are worthy of with Quincy Jones, Patrick Williams or some other great arranger before they are all gone.  But its great hearing you at 72, you sounded great.","classification":4,"fold":0}

It is an already terrible song that overplayed on the radio way too much. \"Who Says You Can't Go Home\" and this song aren't different from bad lyric placement. The reason why THIS song is bad because of the line \"Two days in hell just ain't gonna do\". Like I said in the Bon Jovi\/Jennifer Nettles song review, songs AREN'T good when they do this. A descent song that does this becomes horrible, and this song was actually already horrible. James Otto isn't a bad artist at all, in fact, he does better with anything other than this song. \"Sunset Man\", which is the album that features this song, is actually not at all bad. Reviewed, the album would get a 3\/5. This song isn't good at all, in fact it is very bad, but at least James Otto's other songs have passion.","classification":1,"fold":0}

{"text":"Let Freedom Reign is a great progression in Chrisette's musical career. I was blown away by the originality of her debut album and while her second was good, I felt that her creativity and songwriting ability were subjugated by the label thinking that pairing her with Ne-Yo would garner crossover appeal.\n\nLet Freedom Reign is a phenomenal album featuring strong songwriting & lyrical arrangements and just plain good music. It ranks up there with Erykah Badu, Monica & Fantasia's recent albums as a cohesive, consistent r&b album. As a fan of strong singer\/songwriters, I am glad that Chrisette seemingly went with her gut and wrote 98% of the songs. Personally this is what draws me to her as an artist - her lyrics are thought-provoking and deep and while the album doesn't have a lot of hook-driven tracks, it is a grower because the more I listen to it, the better it gets.\n\nTo those who listened once and are disappointed, please give it more of a chance to \"marinate on your brain\" by listening to it over time because this album is brilliant in construction & content. Unfortunately for Chrisette she is not a priority of her label so hopefully good word of mouth about this album will cause more people to give her music a chance.  She is one of few young r&b female artists who are intelligent, write thoughtful lyrics and don't use sex to sell their image and I appreciate that and hope that more people discover her music.\n\nMy standout tracks are: I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I DO; GOODBYE GAME; I KNOW NOTHING; IF NOBODY SANG ALONG; I'M A STAR & NUMBER ONE.  (**IF NOBODY SANG ALONG is an especially honest track on which Chrisette debates selling out her image & songs so that she can fit in with other artists vs. remaining true to herself.)\n\nOn a superficial note, this is the 1st deluxe digital album I've bought & it was worth the purchase.  The booklet is amazing and being somewhat of a nerd who enjoys reading album liner notes, I felt that this booklet along with the video for \"I'M A STAR\" made this a worthwhile purchase.","classification":4,"fold":0}

I know she released her sophomore album, but it doesn't shine like this one. In my opinion, \"Your Woman\" is probably one of the most underrated, underplayed soul albums of all time. Sunshine outdid herself on this one! Have you listened to the whole cd? Great promotion was given to the track \"Heard It All Before\". That was a serious club anthem for a quick minute, but there was a lot more on this project, a lot of funk and grooves hidden between the verses. I for one continue to rock this album as even the skits are worthy of note. Sunshine would do well to pair up with these producers again and hit us with another solid album. She's too talented to not be at the forefront of the soul scene. I predict she'll be back and will deliver with the zest she's capable of.\n\nDJ Come of Age","classification":5,"fold":0}

I am thinking about DJ Premier, Pete Rock and Buckwild to produce it with guest appearances by Nas, CL Smooth, Common and Cormega.\n\nNone the less, pick up this CD to support AZ.

His album covers from this period make that evident. Unfortunately, donning a snazzy suit and singing chestnuts does not make one Tony Bennett any more than tossing on a leather jacket and ripped jeans makes one Joey Ramone or sporting a soulful swoon makes one Al Green.\n\nIn the world of Rod Stewart image is consistently at the forefront, especially on this disc, where he sounds in perpetual need of a throat lozenge. While his voice has coolly mellowed, not every show biz veteran emanates nostalgic gold on cue.\n\nThis music is as much about marketing and product-placement as the drivel being spilled out by acts such as Katy Perry or Ke$ha, with little to no soul, substance or artistry behind it. The only difference is the demographic being aimed at - here, baby boomers with only a minimal amount of sophistication or taste (if that) who know this material is \"good for them\" but do not have the energy, drive or impetus to locate performances of these songs from better, more suitable vocal interpreters. \"Rod Stewart\" is therefore more a brand and familiar face in this context.\n\nThe arrangements are textured and nicely orchestrated, and Stewart usually sounds like he is supplying differing emotions as he moves in and out of the tracks - and these are, after all, some of the best songs ever written. Even a minimum of competence as a singer can make the likes of \"What a Difference a Day Makes\" and \"I've Got the World on a String\" sound fine.\n\nStewart displays a minimum of enthusiasm for the material and his job as singer, so it all does sound \"fine\" - not transcendent, not brilliant, not particularly soulful, rich or stirring - in other words, not good enough.\n\nIn an era where we, by some wonderful luck, still have Tony Bennett regularly touring and hitting the backs of concert halls, unmiked, with his rendition of Bart Howard's \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" there is simply no need to hear Rod Stewart sleepwalk his way through it. It is redundant, reductive, excessive and unwholesome all at once, much like the experience of Michael Buble performing Sinatra bastardization in a predictable suit and tie. Mimicry is not art.\n\nGo to the nearest jazz hole in the wall you can find if music really matters to you. Order a cocktail and sit down. You are guaranteed to have a more genuine experience than you would have playing this CD or seeing one of Mr. Stewart's overpriced concerts.\n\nAnd if that's out of reach, try any album by Madeleine Peyroux.","classification":2,"fold":0}

{"text":"In silent windless night\nThe voices of the distant stars\nAre ringing in my heart\n\nThis music is filled with transparency. It conveys very simple and clear emotions which purify the heart and arouse the spirit. Some sentimental notes are felt in the music of the album \"A Star Danced\" by David Wahler. These are voices of silent nights when you are alone with your own essence and naked in front of the unfolding endlessness.\n\nThe sampled electronic music of David Wahler is full of individuality. It speaks its own very personal language. Sometimes the celestial nocturnal tunes of \"A Star Danced\" remind me of the music of Jonn Serrie. But David Wahler definitely has his own style. Maybe the comparison with Jonn Serrie occurs to me because the music of \"A Star Danced\" has an evident healing effect. It rehabilitates the mind and raises the spirit. The piano of David Whaler is warm-hearted and moving.\n\nOne wants to say also that the music of \"A Star Danced\" is bewitchingly beautiful. David Wahler is a magnificent composer. \"A Star Danced\" is listened to in one breath. This release is a very precious sample of music therapy.\n\nSerge Kozlovsky\n[...]","classification":5,"fold":0}

CD has 14 tracks (\"Thumb Hang\" is a \"bonus track\"), and running time is 56:57.\n\nI bought this as a companion to the documentary\/film, THE STORY OF ANVIL, as a kind of soundtrack to that picture.  For the most part, this album puts across themes about the record business, ethics, commercial betrayal or disappointment, being passed by, and social commentary, though Anvil's lyrical style reminds me of undeveloped teenage (mentally about 15?) boys' attitudes, this coming from guys in their 50s.\n\nGuitar work is very decent, as is Robb's drumming.  Overall sound in \"heavy\" in the bass and drums, which is a plus here complimenting the themes in the songs.  Anvil's a serviceable bar band chugging out original songs in much the same style they were doing in the late '80s.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Bob Marley & The Wailers-Burnin' *****\n\nReleased in 1973, the same year as the bands debut Catch A Fire was released, and while many consider one significantly greater then the other, which varies who you ask, I must say they both go hand in hand. Catch A Fire and this, Burnin' are sort of like a ying, and yang thing, not to sound too cliche. Catch A Fire seems to be more about peace and togetherness while Burnin' is the opposite spectrum, more empowering, and more about overcoming and getting yours. Marley was always an activist through his lyrics, you could say he was to reggae what Johnny Cash was to country as far as civil justice and spirituality is concerned.\n\nContaining two of the groups biggest hits, the great opener 'Get Up, Stand Up' and the immortal 'I Shot The Sheriff' which is far better then the Clapton cover, and also shows the vicious side of Marleys lyrics. But it's 'Rasta Man Chant' 'Small Axe' 'Pass It On' and the vehement 'Burnin And Lootin' that make this album a classic.\n\nThe new release of the album contains three bonus tracks. 'Reincarnated Souls' being the best, and one that would have perfectly complimented the original album. The other two being less impressive but still great, 'No Symphony' and the chilling 'The Oppressed Song.'\n\nAfter Burin' Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh would both leave to form solo projects, Tosh being the most successful of the two. His album Legalize It is another classic. The departure of those two members would forever change the sound of the band. They would aim for a more commercial appeal while that isn't a bad thing it did seem to loose something. Though I did enjoy the later background vocals they were not as good as the first two albums, and neither was the musicianship which is something Burnin' has an amazing amount of. Burnin' is an album which I would recommend to anyone who is interested in more then Bob Marley & The Wailers hits.","classification":5,"fold":0}

Don't get me wrong I like Riptide, but this is in a different league.\n\nWith members of The Meters and Little Feat backing him, this album is really tight. It would have been quite something to see these guys live. The material is a mixture of originals and two classics by the great New Orleans musician and producer Allen Toussaint. These are the title track and \"From a Whisper to a Scream\". Palmers vocals are as smooth as you would expect and unlike much material from the early 70's this doesn't date.\n\nThis album and Pressure Drop (Palmers 2nd I believe) are both well worth getting. Robert Palmer changed styles throughout his career but never matched these two early classics.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"It is honestly and absolutely so sad when someone young and talented throws their life away from all the vices in the world they can never get over. Unfortunately one of those 90's souls, Scott Weiland from Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver died early at the age of 48. He has had so many great songs on his own, as a part of Velvet Revolver with Slash of Guns N' Roses, but especially when he was with S.T.P. The songs he had back in the 90's were the catalyst of his life. Sadly though, he died of those drug and alcohol problems, and his time in prison. Interstate Love Song, one his biggest songs from the S.T.P. album Purple is one of those songs that really brought out the best in his voice, and his spirit. He definitely drove from top to bottom in the song. It was really his best song, and the groups' biggest hit. I think of when he was gifted with a brilliant and gritty voice. But to see Scott die early, just like Lane Staley of Alice IN Chains and Kurt Cobain of Nirvana was no surprise.

While many music critics were disappointed that the guys would experiment in more orchestral sounds, I thought the blend of classical, ambient, and techno really elevated the film. Of course the guys didn't totally ditched their dance roots. \"Derezzed\" was nothing short of classic Daft Punk. I totally dug \"Tron Legacy\" which combined the haunting melodies of the film's theme song with groovy dance beats. I really enjoyed every single track on the album.

{"text":"This is by far Zeppelin's best \"official\" live recordings that are available. Though the audio quality may be better in How the West Was Won, the band sounds its best in these earlier live recordings. Plant's powerful, gritty blues\/rock vocals are at their absolute best here, as is Page's masterful guitar play. The absolute best versions of Stairway, Since I've Been Loving You, Dazed and Confused, Black Dog, Heartbreaker, How Many More Times, Thank You, etc. are all contained within The BBC Sessions. If you already own the original 2 disc release, you may or may not want to shell out the money for the one disc of new material. I lost my original copy, so I was more than happy to buy this on its release date, because these live recordings have long been my favorite. The tracks are all remastered, but honestly I found little to no difference compared to the older copy. If anything, it seemed the guitar was a bit louder and Plant's vocals maybe a little quieter than before. But not a HUGE difference from the original. Of course, I don't have the two versions to compare side-to-side, so that opinion is strictly from memory. This collection is FAR better than the Sound Remains the Same recordings, and I prefer it over How the West Was Won (though that is also a fantastic collection of live recordings). If you want early Zep in their rawest, most powerful, most skillful form, then look no further than The Complete BBC Sessions. Other earlier live recordings of the band I recommend would be the Osaka Japan recordings and Blueberry Hill (both are bootlegs and unofficial material).\n\nI purchased this album at a local Meijer store the morning of release.

{"text":"Hard to believe that it has almost been 5 years since Michael Jackson tragically died the way he did of his strife and heartbreak. I absolutely know he never forgot all the years he was maliciously judged as a person he wasn't in life, and cost him at the very end. But afterwards he had this cavalcade of music that was left behind in death. Some of the songs were absolutely good with Jackson's voice behind in spirit, and others just haven't been what made Michael Jackson so special to begin with. Love Never Felt So Good, the lead single from Xscape, Michael's collection of unreleased songs isn't a bad song, but honestly not really as strong as the earlier songs Michael had released from his Thriller and Bad records. It is fair for massive fans, but not really anything that delivers just as much as what made him a great artist to begin with.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"I think a lot of the bad reviews of this song are missing the point -- this song was intended as a joke, a satire of pop music's clichs and the absurdity of many popular songs.  Even the band\/comedy group Ylvis, who wrote and performed the dang thing, call the song \"a stupid thing\" and were genuinely surprised that it became as popular as it did.  And as a satire\/parody, it does its job well, playing up all the clichs of modern pop and coming up with some of the most inanely bizarre lyrics ever heard outside a \"Weird\" Al song.\n\nNow that the song's popularity has died down somewhat, it will probably fade into relative obscurity like some of the novelty songs of the past (how many people still regularly listen to \"Party Rock Anthem?\").  And people can now appreciate this song for what it is -- an enormously catchy dance number with really stupid lyrics.\n\nI admit, I got hooked on this song when I first heard it, despite being weirded out by the accompanying music video.  It's a lively and upbeat electronic number, full to bursting with the typical tropes of a pop music number, which is kind of the point.  The lyrics are rather silly, as the singer contemplates what sound a fox makes and what it does with its life, but given the inane subject matter of a lot of popular songs, it's not TOO out of place -- is a song about a fox really less stupid than a lot of the subject matter artists pick for their music?\n\nAll that said, however... this definitely isn't a song for all tastes.  I love the music but cringe at the lyrics, and given how overplayed this song has been in recent times it gets annoying fast.  Maybe an instrumental version of the song would be better...\n\nNot a masterpiece, but still a catchy number that isn't meant to be taken seriously at all.  I'd wait for the hype to die down a little more before putting it on your music player, though...","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"From his debut hit \"Life's A Dance\" in late 1992 through the rest of the '90s, John Michael Montgomery (with his easy going baritone) was one of country music's most reliable hitmakers.  Over the past four years, however, he's had but one top ten hit, the chart topping heart tugger \"The Little Girl.\"  With his recent singles struggling, a hits collection was the logical choice for Montgomery's next release.  A sequel to 1997's GREATEST HITS made the most sense, as Montgomery has ten top 20 hits not included on that first set.  Instead, Warner Brothers went with this career encompassing VERY BEST OF that contains 11 of the 14 recordings already found on the strong selling GREATEST HITS.\nAmong the hits not included on either collection are the engaging \"Ain't Got Nothin' On Us,\" \"Love Working On You,\" and \"Hello L.O.V.E.\"  All are uptempo romps that would have contributed nicely to the ballad-heavy VERY BEST OF.  The sequencing on VERY BEST OF distorts the musical nonbalance even more, with three fast tunes leading off, followed by a slew of slow stuff.  The collection concludes with two new ballads: the paternal reflection \"Cool\" and the pledge of devotion \"One Day Less.\"  While pleasant, neither track seems likely to reverse Montgomery's recent chart struggles.  Ultimately, while it contains more tracks and covers a longer period of Montgomery's recording career, this VERY BEST OF is not as enjoyable to listen to as his earlier GREATEST HITS.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Jack Johnson lost his father and his will to write before a sudden flood of songs emerged for the creation of \"To The Sea,\" dedicated to his father's memory. While the songs rarely stray far from Jack's usual sunny surfer sound, there are a few moments where the grown-up lost-boy lets his emotions free in the lyrics. The result is my favorite Jack Johnson CD to date.\n\nBoth \"To The Sea\" and \"Only The Ocean\" have the emotional tug to them that has sometimes been absent from Jack's easy-going music. He was exploring relationships more on 2008's \"Sleep Through The Static;\" this time he's hitting the notes even better. And yet, his music, guitar playing and style are as smooth as always.\n\nI am also enjoying his maturing lyrics outside the relationships. There's a certain Kinksian quality to \"No Good With Faces\" and \"Pictures of People Taking Pictures,\" which ups the ante. \"Red Wine, Mistakes and Mythology\" is standard Jack Johnson, with a fun feel to it, with the clever wordplay and the sing-song feel of his best work. As always, Johnson sets a mood and runs with it through \"To The Sea,\" and ultimately it's a satisfying one.","classification":4,"fold":0}

Dark Horse, the latest single from the lackluster Prism album firmly does not ignite at all. In fact the song that she did with Juicy J does not even impress. Her voice feels more robotic and dormid into the song, where there is little to nothing to hear from her.

{"text":"This is great going for a band whose era had dried up, not helped by the abysmal new releases by Van Halen, The Cult, and I scarcely need say anything about some of the LA bands or the pop \"hard rock\" survivors.\n\nWell a Don Dokken melody is pretty much typical of his style, and the vocal melodies are always reminiscent of Breaking the Chains, Alone Again, In My Dreams, Escape, There Was A Time and so on. But I seem to like the standard melodies that Dokken comes out with though it sounds like I might have heard it before. They also continue in the slower weary and bitter but hopeful vein, going back a decade and more, which is also something I prefer - the band's claims that it's a return to a faster, harder era always prove to be untrue. You sense that Don is forcing himself to play a few harder tunes like Empire, but that he wishes to go slow and moody, which to me is a great idea.\n\nAgain, the song writing is not brilliant but like albums since Long Way Home, it's close to the same quality of songwriting which I find to be fair. No very strong hooks, and memorable riffs are absent normally but the songwriting seems to work and the interesting melodies are here as usual. Don's unique voice is still great to listen to. I became quite impressed on hearing Today especially , which sounded familiar, and so of course became disappointed to find that it was a cover of Jefferson Starship's song. That's the best song here and Burning Tears is the next as I see it. Empire is not so great, but the other typical mid-tempo world weary songs make for a fairly good and consistent album.\n\nThis was my most anticipated album of the year. If they keep releasing an album of this kind every few years like this, I'd be quite happy.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"First of all, there is that voice. Brittany Howard is a force of nature, one to be reckoned with, and she makes it count on Alabama Shakes' second album, \"Sound and Color.\" Now that they've established themselves with their still awesome debut, they used the time wisely to both road test the new songs and use the studio as an instrument. The opening vibes on the title track are your first clue. There's a touch of psychedelics there, but don't fret. \"Don't Wanna Fight No More\" is one of those songs where Brittany just cuts loose. It's a hot vamp for guitarist Heath Fogg to work over. Or take in the primitive stomp on \"Gemini.\"\n\nThere's a lot of that going on for \"Sound and Color.\" The band is mixing it up, the way the album's title would suggest. They still have that dirty south feel to the sound of it all, but they also want to expand their range. They're painting with a much broader palette than before. Be it the garage band pulse of \"The Greatest\" or the blues wail of \"Gimme All Your Love,\" \"Sound and Color\" is a huge leap forward from \"Boys and Girls.\" Once again, this band is a force of nature. Raw and roots, soul and rock, it all comes together.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"The Rolling Stones' fifth studio album of the 1970s (and sixth overall for their Rolling Stones Records label which was distributed by Atlantic Records) entitled Black and Blue was released in April of 1976.\nThis particular Rolling Stones album was the first studio album for the band since the abrupt departure of guitarist Mick Taylor who left after the It's Only Rock and Roll album's releaseand promo videos shot for the album. Some have called Black and Blue \"the guitar audition album\" because Wayne Perkins, Harvey Mandel (of Canned Heat) and Ron Wood (of Rod Stewart's Faces) all took turns auditioning for the guitarist spot abandoned by Taylor (and Wood would eventually acquire the spot as of 1975). Lead singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards wrote all but one track  (\"Cherry Oh Baby\") on this album and the album is a classic (as I found out when I grabbed the album for Christmas in 1989 on cassette when it was on Rolling Stones\/Columbia\/CBS Records).\nThe Black and Blue album was recorded between December of 1974 and December of 1975 in Germany at Musicland Studios and at Mountain Studios in Montreux with Mick and Keith producing and the late Keith Harwood recording and the legendary Glyn Johns mixing in February of 1976 at Atlantic Studios. Bass player Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts played well on this album as well.\nThe Black and Blue album opens with the funky opener \"Hot Stuff\" which featured lead guitarist Harvey Mandel which stiffed as a single. Next is the rocker \"Hand of Fate\" with Wayne Perkins doing some great fretwork. We follow with the reggae version of \"Cherry Oh Baby\" featuring Nicky Hopkins on organ. Side one closed with the superb ballad \"Memory Motel\" featuring Mick on piano as well as vocal with Keithalso singing the refrain at the end of the choruses.\nRon Wood's slide induced guitar kicks Side 2 off with the rocker \"Hey Negrita\". Next is the jazzy duet with Billy Preston called \"Melody\" which sounds like something from a jazz club complete with horn sections. Next is the hit ballad from the album entitled \"Fool to Cry\" featuring Jagger on vocals and Fender Rhodes piano and Nicky Hopkins on grand piano (the song was a Top 10 hit in the US). We close with the rocker \"Crazy Mama\" with a great guitar riff from Mick Jagger whom played rhythm guitars on the track and also sings like no tomorrow..\nThe Black and Blue album did very well hitting #1 making it the fifth Stones studio effort in a row to top Billboard and was the first Platinum album for the band. Some fans hate this album, but others like me, love it. The remaster has all of the original LP credits and artwork restored.\nThis album is highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Patsy Cline (born Virginia Patterson Hensley, September 8, 1932 - March 5, 1963) was a superbly gifted country music singer--very few could, can or ever will match her ability to take any tune and make it sound wonderful, special, fresh and very new! Patsy also put her heart and soul into everything she sang; and that's grand. Sadly, she died so young in a private plane crash; but at least she lives on through her music. This is an excellent CD of her artistry for both fans and newcomers alike.\n\nThere's not a single dud in the lot here; every song is just that good! \"Walkin' After Midnight,\" written by  Alan Block and Donn Hecht, is a fine way to start the track set--Patsy is squarely front and center which is right where she belongs! The music, as is the case with all the tracks here, fits in perfectly with Patsy's vocals. \"A Poor Man's Roses (Or a Rich Man's Gold)\" is very well done and Patsy does a great job on \"Lovesick Blues\" which is a number I really like. \"I Fall to Pieces\" (Pasty's first #1 hit on the country charts and her second hit on the pop charts) and \"True Love\" from Patsy's 1961 album entitled \"Patsy Cline Showcase\" are most poignant and Patsy sings \"San Antonio Rose\" with panache--I love it! \"Crazy,\" a number by Willie Nelson, shines bright in Patsy's more than capable hands; it's her signature song despite the fact that she didn't like it at all initially!\n\n\"Strange\" is very well done--there's some backup vocals for Patsy and while they do sound pretty good Patsy never really needed backup; her talent carried her through every time! Patsy's interpretation of Hank Cochran's \"She's Got You\" is very impressive; and Patsy's \"Heartaches\" is easily the very best I've ever heard! \"Half As Much\" is easy on the ear even if the lyrics aren't all that happy while \"When I Get through with You (You'll Love Me Too)\" is certainly more upbeat. \"Imagine That\" gets a fine treatment from Patsy and \"So Wrong\" yet again features Patsy's beautiful contralto voice. \"Why Can't He Be You\" is another moving number.\n\n\"Leavin' on Your Mind\" is an incredibly fine tune that gets the royal treatment from Patsy Cline and \"When You Need a Laugh\" is a real gem! \"Back in Baby's Arms\" has a great sound to it as do the other numbers here and songs like \"Faded Love\" make me wish so badly that Patsy was still with us. \"Always\" is a classic for sure and the album ends with two splendid songs, Harlan Howard's \"He Called Me Baby\" and Don Gibson's \"Sweet Dreams (Of You).\"\n\nPatsy Cline shared so much of her gift with us that we are all better off for it. I highly recommend her exceptional music.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"nirvana (noun) - a place or state characterized by freedom from or oblivion to pain, worry, and the external world.\n\ngrunge (noun) - dirt, filth, rubbish; something of inferior quality; trash.\n\nThe 1980s were one big, immoral popularity contest.  Never mind the quality - if it was \"in,\" people wanted it.  While hard rock had dominated most of the 1970s, the 80s were all about pop: artists like Michael Jackson, Phil Collins, Lionel Ritchie, and Whitney Houston.  By 1980, punk rock, which began in the mid-70s, had evolved into \"new wave,\" spawning groups like Tears for Fears and A Flock of Seagulls.  Meanwhile, rock titans like Neil Young seemed to have lost all the edginess that made them so attractive; Bob Dylan stumbled through the decade, fashioning a couple great albums and releasing a much greater number of duds.  Music aficionados were forced to ponder the direst of ponderings: was rock dead?\n\nWhether rock was dead or alive, Nirvana rejuvenated it and brought it back to the forefront, nearly stopping pop in its place.  The world hadn't heard anything so ferocious and reeling with pained awareness since the days of the Sex Pistols, and for a world still feeling hungover from the superficial craze of the 1980s, it was a welcome wake-up call.  Nirvana actually emerged at the end of the 80s, led by lead vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain and also featuring Krist Novoselic on bass and, initially, Chad Channing on the drums.  They released their debut, \"Bleach,\" in 1989, produced and recorded for a mere $600 on the Sub Pop label.  It sold roughly 6,000 copies.  When the band heard that Sub Pop was going to become a subsidiary for a major label, they decided to \"cut out the middleman\" and were signed to Geffen Records.  \"Grunge\" music, the murky indie-alternative rock played by groups like Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, or, more famously, Pearl Jam, was on the verge of becoming popular.  Geffen executives hoped Nirvana could find some fame as one of the better grunge bands.  They hoped to sell 250,000 copies of Nirvana's second effort, 1991's \"Nevermind,\" earning a \"Gold\" certification from the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America).  The band themselves didn't really care.\n\nWhen the record was released in late 1991, MTV's late night music video showcase \"120 Minutes\" began playing \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" the album's lead single.  Soon it became so popular that the network began playing it during the day.  The album appeared on the Billboard 200 at #144, and in November of '91 it entered the Billboard Top 40 at #35.  Half of the initial U.S. pressings went to the northwest, where the album quickly sold out and was unavailable for days.  Around the rest of the country, the album began selling so quickly that none of Geffen's marketing strategies could be enacted.  Finally, in January of 1992, Nevermind hit #1 on the Billboard Top 40.  At that time, it was selling roughly 300,000 copies per week.\n\nCritical response to the album was decidedly mixed.  Rolling Stone gave it 3 out of 5 stars, saying, \"If Nirvana isn't onto anything altogether new, Nevermind does possess the songs, character and confident spirit to be much more than a reformulation of college radio's high-octane hits.\"  On the other hand, Robert Christgau, the so-called \"Dean of American Rock Critics,\" gave the album an A.  \"This is hard rock as the term was understood before metal moved in - the kind of loud, slovenly, tuneful music you think no one will ever work a change on again until the next time it happens,\" Christgau wrote.\n\nThat's exactly what \"Nevermind\" is: a hard rock, post-punk album picking up where the punk groups of the 1970s left off.  It's harder now to understand just what an impact it had upon its release. Nirvana's sound has been imitated countless times by countless groups (Nickelback, Creed, etc. etc.), resulting in a new form of rock: grunge.  When Nevermind was released at the beginning of the 90s, despite its cover art depicting a baby pursuing a dollar bill on a fishing hook underwater, it was like a generation coming up for air after being drowned in commercial, spiritless noise for a decade.  Nirvana defined its generation like no other, and \"Nevermind\" was the crucial album of the 1990s.\n\nTo really understand the album or the band, one must be familiar with its leader: the legendary, quasi-infamous Kurt Cobain.  Most people are very familiar with him, due in no small part to his untimely and much-discussed death in 1994.  He was born in Aberdeen, Washington, a small coastal town that looks like something out of \"The Fog.\"  Friends and family have said that he was the sweetest of children, but his teenage years were a horse of a different color. Cobain hated athletics (despite his father signing him up for the local wrestling and baseball teams, on which Cobain did quite well) and befriended a gay student, leading to taunts and bullying from Cobain's peers.  He focused mostly on drawing, and kept a personal journal, in which he at one point wrote, \"I am not gay, although I wish I were, just to piss off homophobes.\"\n\nCobain is a rock god.  He was named the greatest rock n' roll hero of all time by \"NME\" readers in 2006, and he remains one of the most enigmatic and fascinating personalities in the history of popular music.  On the outside, he was a good-looking, hostile, roughly-dressed twenty-something; on the inside, he was fighting an endless battle against his own inner demons.  The thing that separated Cobain from his similarly rude, rebellious peers was this: he cared about the world.  He really did, and he wasn't afraid to admit it.  Much of the immense pain in his life came from his own terror at the state of the world and, in particular, the people in it.  It's evident not only from his many, many quotes, but from his songs themselves.  Rough numbers like the mocking \"In Bloom\" or the woeful \"Lithium\" sound angry and reckless on top, but beneath all the anger there's immense sorrow at the state of things.  The trademark punk madness, juxtaposed with sincere humanism, was one of the most appealing things about Nirvana.\n\nThen there's the lyrics themselves, penned by Cobain.  While rival group Pearl Jam sang, \"I take a walk outside\/I'm surrounded by some kids at play\/I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear?\", Nirvana grumbled lines like, \"When I was an alien, cultures weren't opinions,\" or such refrains as, \"Give an inch, take a smile\/Fashion shifts, fashion style\/Throw it out and keep it in\/Have to have poison skin.\"  Cobain seemed to be almost rambling as he spewed out line after line of surreal poetry, and though all of it may not mean much - his bandmates attest that most of the lyrics were written within five minutes of their first performance - there sure appeared to be some sort of deeper meaning.  Cobain seemed to be on to something which the rest of the public couldn't quite grasp.\n\nHis lyrics wouldn't have been nearly as powerful without the music to back them up.  Songs like \"On a Plain\" were simple enough to catch the public ear, but at the same time, the arrangement of the music added a new and very appealing depth to them.  Despite his aim to wipe the earth clean of the shiny, soulless tunes of the 80s, Cobain loved pop music.  In fact, \"Nevermind\"'s most famous song, the inescapable \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" (voted the 9th best song of all time by \"Rolling Stone\"), was Cobain's attempt to write the perfect song.  While crafting \"Nevermind,\" he aimed to create the ultimate pop album in the vein of his heroes, the Beatles, one which was modern and catchy enough to obliterate records like Michael Jackson's \"Dangerous\" (number 1 on the charts at that time) but meaningful and spirited enough that the public would grow from listening to it, not step back as they had in the 80s.  Of course, he wanted it to rock, too.\n\nThe result was a manic, pounding, rollicking rush of intense rock music.  Bassist Krist Novoselic added an oily murkiness to the tracks, keeping Cobain's edgy, buzzing guitars from taking off, much like Cobain's own darkness prevented him from ever soaring as a public figure (until his death - more on that later).  The band's original drummer, Chad Channing, was fired and replaced with Dave Grohl.  Where Channing just sort of rolled through each song, Grohl was like a hurricane and an earthquake in one thunderous package.  When he drummed, he drummed.  He didn't have the versatility or sheer prowess of drummers like Rush's Neil Peart or Stewart Copeland of the Police, but he could and did pound the hell out of those things, much like the Who's Keith Moon.  In the public eye, Kurt Cobain was Nirvana, but any fan will tell you that Novoselic and Grohl were equally important, the firm, high-velocity support for Cobain's meandering surrealism.\n\nOf Nirvana's three albums, \"Nevermind\" is widely regarded as their masterpiece.  Each of its 12 tracks are gems.  It may be a testament to the album that its lead single, the aforementioned \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" is probably its weakest track.  That song, with others like the rambunctious \"Breed,\" or the purposefully abysmal \"Territorial Pissings,\"are pure hard-rocking delights.  The watery guitar on the almost ethereal \"Come As You Are\" is irresistible, while the surprisingly melodic chorus of \"On a Plain,\" or the woeful breeziness of \"Something in the Way,\" are downright ghostly.  While the record may have retained that ghostliness since its release, it's certainly more haunting considering the dark circumstances of Cobain's death.\n\nThere is no underlying theme on \"Nevermind.\"  It's not conceptually dense or extraodinarily creative, like \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\"  And all these years later, the abundance of Nirvana-wannabes on popular radio have numbed our ears.  But if at first \"Nevermind\" doesn't seem particularly amazing, listen to it again, and then again, and perhaps even again, and to your surprise, you will forget about all those other \"post-grunge\" groups out there and hear the album as the world heard it back in `91 and `92.  What makes \"Nevermind\" so wonderful is, in part, its story: after all, Cobain and his crew had no intentions of blowing the world away when they released the album.  Then there's the music.  \"Nevermind\" is the sound of a band that had something to say, said it, and had a pretty good time saying it too.  It's rowdy, but aware (painfully so, at times); visceral, but sophisticated.  It's amazing that a genre so inherently ugly, punk, can turn out to be so wise and beautiful.  And punk was never more beautiful than Nirvana.\n\nTruly, Nirvana could have been the best and biggest band since the Beatles.  Although the Beatles' debut was a piece of pop perfection, it took them five more albums to craft a genuinely brilliant record.  Nirvana's debut, on the other-hand, was a nasty, black snake of a record, far from brilliant, but certainly promising.  It took them only one more album to generate a masterpiece, though, and their next album, \"In Utero,\" was similarly great.  \"In Utero\" is, perhaps, structurally and conceptually deeper than \"Nevermind,\" and it sounds more like the rough, vomitific rock of \"Bleach\" than the shiny yet slimey rock of \"Nevermind\" (a sound which the band often expressed their disapproval with).  But \"Nevermind\" was their masterpiece, a perfect rock record that spoke to millions of people.  If one considers that all this was done within the course of three albums, it's breathtaking to think what the group may have done had not Cobain been killed.\n\nSo if the band could've been so great, what happened?  Well, although Nirvana was the pride and joy of American listeners around 1992, when \"In Utero\" was released in 1993, the public was losing interest.  \"In Utero\" was an album that intentionally challenged its listeners, and considering that most listeners were just getting familiar with its predecessors, that was a challenge they weren't willing to accept.  On top of that, the public was getting sick of Cobain's seemingly incessant depression and disregard for his fans.  He was becoming more and more alienated by the band's sudden popularity, too.  1994 found Cobain seeking a divorce from his wife, Courtney Love (the public frequently called \"Cobain & Love\" the new \"Lennon & Ono\"), and even planning to disband Nirvana.\n\nThen he was killed.  The public went mad.  Suddenly everyone loved Nirvana again, and everybody always had.  They were brilliant.  Cobain was immortalized, trapped forever as the dark, troubled 27-year-old lead of one of the greatest bands of all time.  A nation grieved for one of its most promising and talented youth.  How did he die?  Suicide, officially.  The most popular rock music conspiracy is that Cobain didn't kill himself: he was murdered.  He and his band are still discussed in this day, and truthfully, if he hadn't died such a sudden and shocking death, they might not have been remembered so fondly.\n\nRegardless of the history, Nevermind is one hell of an album.  \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it #17 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums, commenting, \"His [Cobain's] slashing riffs, corrosive singing and deviously oblique writing, rammed home by the Pixies-via-Zeppelin might of bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl, put the warrior purity back in rock & roll.\"  It was ranked the second best album ever on VH1's list (behind the Beatles' \"Revolver\"), and has ranked toward the top of countless other \"all-time best\" lists.  Deservedly so.  This is truly one of the finest records ever cut, so fine that it almost single-handedly murdered our nation's obsession with pop.  Unfortunately, Nirvana ended too soon to complete their mission, and so we remain a nation terrifyingly conscious of trashy pop and sickeningly unaware of the good stuff, the real music - stuff like this.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I have had a lot of \"FAVORITE BANDS\" that made up my listening enjoyment over the years... after all music IS the soundtrack to our lives, especially if you are an audiophile like myself. The way BARONESS came into my life was as follows: I was already a fan of MASTODON, and I kept hearing about this new band's debut album, and how they were like the next MASTODON or something... whatever! Then, all the \"best metal albums of the year\" lists came out, and REVOLVER magazine put them at the very top! Now, THIS got my attention, and I figured I better read what they gotta say about 'em. In that review, they quoted the band as saying that they studied several \"CLASSIC\" records (which they would not name), and tried to take the elements that made them such, and distill this knowledge into the writing and recording of their record. What can I say? I was sold, and I went out and bought the album... the \"Red Album\". I liked it, and went back to it a few times, but wasn't 100%. At this point, no one knew (not even the band I think) that there would be a color scheme with each new record. But when I heard that \"Blue Record\" was coming out, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm sure glad it did. \"Blue Record\" was the album that kicked the door open for me and BARONESS. Not since METALLICA, has a band made an impact on me with such an immersive front to back album. I'll just say that the opening and especially the closing track would be the music that I would like to imagine hearing, as I was ascending to the gates of heaven. The love for that album took me back to their first, and I was able to make peace and be forgiven for not believing. Now that I was on board, I had to hurry up and wait for their next effort. By then, I was personally nearing the bottom of my dependency of alcohol and drugs in the summer of 2012, and when things didn't seem like they could get worse, they did... but not before I could get my hands on \"YELLOW & GREEN\". I'll never be able to listen to that album, (double album) without the memory of how scary, hopeless and inescapable my addiction's had become. Through the turbulent last few months I had after that, I caught wind of a terrible bus accident which like my own situation, put a stop to life as I knew it. With an experience such as the band had, one can easily draw the parallels to that of entering a life of recovery. Today I'm grateful to say that I've been sober since the day I took my last drink on Nov. 4th 2012, and like myself, BARONESS has been on a long but rewarding journey back to health. The fact that \"PURPLE\" exists at all is amazing! If I could say anything to John Baizley and his band mates besides \"Thank You\", I would just say \"PHEW!! WE MADE IT!\".  I have a lot of \"FAVORITE BANDS\", but for me BARONESS is the sound of life being affirmed.","classification":5,"fold":0}

Jana Kramer.\n\nWell, i never heard of her before this (Media, always keeping young-uns from the public). And man, what a shame.... what shame, because this song is so beautiful and has a feeling of reaching. Like searching and knowing that the treasure is just around the corner.

We always feel heart break, and imposters always come our way.... but we keep searching, knowing it will just be around the corner. That hope pushes us forward.

{"text":"The ebb-and-flow of Rivers Cuomo's creative streak over the years has been interesting to follow, for as much as we the public at large can follow is (mostly by seeing how good or not so good a Weezer album is, and how long it takes for a new Weezer album to materialize). But Rivers has taken this to an entirely new level by digging into his musical treasure chest and sharing a bunch of demos, of old and previously unheard songs alike.\n\n\"Alone: The Home Recording of Rivers Cuomo\" (18 tracks; 47 min.) is not only a fascinating look into the writing process of Rivers, but on top of that brings some pretty good music too. Most interesting are the demos of songs intended for the eventually shelved second album \"Songs from the Black Hole\" (instead \"Pinkerton\" was released), which as they are heard here almost play like a musical (\"Blast Off\", \"Dude, We're Finally Landing\", \"Superfriend\" and \"Lover in the Snow\"). In spirit they certainly are closer to Pinkerton than the Blue Album. Other interesting items: the 1995 track \"Wanda (You're My Only Love)\", a rejected song for the \"Angus\" movie soundtrack (instead \"You Gave Your Love\" made it on the soundtrack); \"This Is the Way\", cut from the \"Make Believe\" album; the cover \"Little Diane\" (recorded in 2003); and the closing track \"I Was Made for You\" (from 2004\").\n\nIn all, this album plays surprisingly well, even if obviously the recording quality is not optimal. But a contributing factor to making this album so enjoyable are the lines notes from Rivers. And no, they are not just a line or two pre song, they fill pages and pages as Rivers explains in detail the background of each song (and the lyrics are also printed). In all, while of course this does not break any new musical ground as such, this set is essential for any serious Weezer fan.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Prime Cuts: Great I Am, Song of the Beautiful Bride, Glory Came Down\n\nIt is interesting where singer-songwriters find their inspiration.  Many have often found their creative muses in the happenstances of personal and church relations; others were inspired to write after being piqued by a testimony, a conversation, a film, a newspaper article, a book or a sermon.  Yet, other songs are birthed out of the writer's own tales of struggles and pains.  For Paul Wilbur, it is clear that the Hebrew Scriptures (or the Old Testament) are his major afflatus. Wilbur, in the words of Charles Haddon Spurgeon, bleeds Bibline.  These 11 cuts are so soaked in the grand truths espoused by the Old Testament that they drip with a penetrating cry to us to take Hebrew Bible more seriously.  This comes as no surprise as Wilbur is a Messianic Christian.  This means that Wilbur believes that it is never surreptitious that God would call Israel out of all the nations of the world.  And out of Israel came Jesus the Messiah of whom all Jews as well as Gentiles are called to obeisance.  Thus, deep within Wilbur's heart expressed through his own music, there is a deep passion for Israel as well as the nations to be reconciled in the worship of Jesus.  Whether or not one agrees with Wilbur's dispensational theological paradigm, \"Your Great Name\" is choke full of songs steeped in the motifs, images, phrases and ideas from the Old Testament giving us a rich trove of Biblically-driven worship songs.  Such an approach is not novice to Wilbur: ever since his 1990 Integrity Music debut \"Up to Zion,\" Wilbur has always infused Hebraism into his style of modern worship music.  And to season his recordings with an even more Jewish flavor, three of his former records (\"Shalom Jerusalem,\" \"Jerusalem Arise\" and \"Lion of Judah\") were even recorded in Jerusalem on their important festive days.\n\nUnlike his preceding live records, \"Your Great Name\" is his first studio recording in 20 years.  However, patterning after his 2010 live album \"Desert Rain,\" this album is again thematically focused around a major motif conjured up from the Old Testament-this time around it is \"the name of Yahweh.\"  And just like his more recent records, there is a fuller sound created by an amalgamation of the sounds of the orchestral and the rhythmic of modern worship.  Like the unfolding of a James Horner-movie soundtrack, album opener \"Song of Ezekiel\" is a sprawling and dramatic cinematic orchestral piece calling us back to how God unveils the power of His Name via at Ezekiel's Valley of Dry Bones.  The prophet Ezekiel is not the only prophet evoked, Isaiah's new exodus message is at the cynosure on \"Prepare the Way\" (a track that could actually work as a Christmas worship song across churches).  While the story of Moses and the burning bush shadows behind \"Great I Am.\"  Reverently introduced with just vocals and piano before it is joined by a bevy of strings, \"Great I Am\" is a beautiful ballad about the worship of God's name that causes the demons to flee and the mountains to crumble.\n\nOne of the reasons why Wilbur is such an endearing worship leader lies in vocal prowess.  While many male worship leaders have a light tenor, Wilbur possesses a full-bodied Fernando Ortega operatic base. Trained in high-Italian opera in Milan, Italy, Wilbur utilizes his pedigree well:  when he hits the low notes there is such a gravitas of emotional depths that send shimmers down one's soul.  This is most evident in the guitar driven \"Who is Like You.\"  And when it is time to soar, listen to some vocal-power exuberance especially on \"Glory Come Down.\"  However, Wilbur is at his vocal best with the climax-building worship pop ballad \"Nobody Like You.\"  Starting off soft and slow before building and building up his vocal intensity this is a track where you can hear Wilbur in his full vocal glory.\n\nVocal gymnastics aside, one song not to be missed is \"Song of the Beautiful Bride.\"  Keying on the Biblical theme that we are the bride of Christ made up of various nations this song is a passionate call for all of us to be united in reflecting the light of our coming bridegroom.  All in all, \"Your Great Name\" is not just one of your average worship albums.  The Messianic worship songs steeped in the language of the Old Testament is itself a reason to warm up to this album.  Add to this Wilbur has a gorgeous voice; it's one that truly makes songs exalting the great name of Yahweh even more majestic and contagious.","classification":5,"fold":0}

Their treatment of some of the classic Christmas songs is typical Chicago style.  Their muscial stylings are not at all hampered by limitations of the seasonal music as one reviewer suggests.  Track #18 \"A Childs Prayer\" is so sweetly performed.  You'd think a band like this wouldn't be able to play something like it without overdoing it.  The songs that Chicago chose to place on this album tell me that this is not just a performance album.  Rather, Christmas has a certain meaning to the members of Chicago.\n\nI believe this should definately become part of your holiday music library.  It's Christmas music with a jolt.

{"text":"Like many other reviewers I absolutely love this band's first album.  I've been a rock fan for 25 years now, and it had been a long time since I had heard a band so raw, powerful and soulful as Alabama Shakes when that one came along.  Probably also like a lot of other reviewers, I was initially a bit startled by the change in sound on the second release.  Upon first listen I was a little underwhelmed and didn't feel like this new batch of performances truly showcased this band's strengths.  Then I listened a few more times and found myself completely enthralled with these subtler, more diverse arrangements.  The raw soul is still here but the band is delving into a wider array of feelings and emotions than they had previously done.  This mostly works in their favor and showcases their crafts(wo)manship.  I hear traces of all kinds of musical threads here, from blues to modern pop to progressive rock.  What's amazing is that it all coheres.  There's beautiful acoustic-based rock, a song that sounds vaguely Brit-poppish, the quasi-psychedelic opener, etc. etc.  At each listen I discover something new.  What keeps me from giving the fifth star is the feeling that this is a bit of a transitional work, consciously designed to step away from the \"modern soul music\" moniker which has been somewhat unfairly bestowed upon this band.  I suppose at times it does sound just a little bit forced, like the band is still stretching its limbs to see how long they'll get rather than settling into themselves and their \"sweet spot.\"  But that's natural and I expect truly great albums to come from this group in the future. Far from a sophomore slump, this is a sharp and intelligent release that is deeply soulful and continuously intriguing.  Very worthy of addition to your collection and belongs on the shelf right next to their breakthrough first release!","classification":4,"fold":0}

I mean it was already \"digital quality\" on the last release and unless you're going back and forth between the two I seriously doubt the human ear could really tell a lot of difference.. other than the fact this new edition is LOUDER. One thing the original pressing has over this is the fact the Hellion intro into Electric Eye was a lot more accurate.. Once you start Electric Eye on this newer version, you will hear more of the Hellion.. doesn't really matter to me but it seemed worth noting. The \"bonus track\" Prisoner Of Your Eyes doesn't do a lot for me and the live recordings are competent but ---\n\nThe US Festival is why you should buy this. I had waited a LONG time to hear this and was buying it sight unheard in the hopes it would at least sound \"serviceable\"... but...I have never before heard a mix this good of a live show! (I use a simple lil Sony 5.1 in-a-box sound system) WOW!! It almost seems too balanced as though there may be some slight of hand going on but I doubt it. I was at this show, a young lad more interested in Ozzy than Priest in those days but wisdom has caught up to me. We lived nearby and came up the night before and slept on the hood of my sisters car.. and were treated to the best damn concert in history the following day (NOT Van Halen)!! NOBODY sells a song or is more vested in his music than Rob Halford, simply watch Metal Gods from this show and you'll know what I mean..Make no mistake, Judas Priest absolutely owned the US Festival, here is your proof ~ start buying.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Maroon 5 offer up a hook filled album that's high on memorable vocal lines and lots of slick pop production. Adam Levine leads the way here as the only band member who contributes to songwriting and he's backed up by a list of pop song writers such as Ryan Tedder (Adele, Beyonce), Mike Posner (Justin Bieber, Pharrell Williams), Shellback (Pink, Taylor Swift, Britney Spears), and Ross Golan (Enrique Inglesias, Keith Urban). As you can see, this album was clearly set up for massive radio play and to showcase the vocal style of Adam Levine in a similar way as Maroon 5's previous album Overexposed. Highlights include the catchy first single \"Maps\", the killer electronic grooves of \"It Was Always You\", the huge power ballad \"Unkiss Me\", and the brilliant piano ballad \"My Heart Is Open\" featuring Gwen Stefani on vocals and co-written with famous pop songwriter Sia who has had her own hit album recently. The deluxe edition includes three bonus tracks including a laid back cover of the hit song \"Sex And Candy\" originally released by Marcy Playground in 1997. Despite the fact that V ends up sounding more like a solo project for Adam Levine, there's lots to like and it sets up Maroon 5 for a tour where they can show off their actual musicianship while performing these highly glossed pop songs.","classification":4,"fold":0}

Hey guys, we love you anyway. This is still labeled as 14+ hours on the graphic but 11 hours in the Amazon listing, but includes lots of music from the first volume so it's really a lot less than that - but still a huge amount of music by any measure.\n\nThe track 22 Tartini Violin Concerto D.53 still apparently contains the entire 13 minute concerto, with movements 2 and 3 repeated in tracks 23 and 24. When I used the Amazon online cloud player and their unwieldy download version (which works like a warm-up for the Obamacare website), track 48 is still the wrong Bach Brandenburg Concerto 5, although it is not wrong on the 30 second snippet. Needless to say, I'm totally confused. Even Martin Bookspan's calm middlebrow voice from the middlebrow 1950s can't help me.

It brought out the better from her heart and her voice on the album. But honestly her latest album is not really a strong follow-up. Her song Let It Burn is a noble song overall, but I did want to feel her voice a bit more into the song. I like the song, but honestly it has sounded familiar from a song that I had heard before, but truthfully I cannot put a ring on it.

{"text":"This is an entertaining song.  While it does mention Christmas in the chorus, it really isn't necessarily a Christmas song, per se.  The real focus is on two characters with polar opposite preferences of weather and temperature.  Since I have not been fortunate enough to see the original special that this song came from, I can't comment on where it fits into the story, but I think the fact that this song isn't strongly attached to the holiday actually makes it a bit more of an evergreen song.  Listen in the middle of the summer and call yourself Heat Miser if you like.  I'm happy being a Snow Miser...\n\nAs to the quality of the song, first of all, when it comes to modern swing, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy can't really go too far wrong.  They are experts of the craft of making music that sounds like it was recorded decades ago but with impeccable fidelity.  That said, this song is a bit slower tempo than their more popular songs, so if you are already familiar with their music, be warned that it isn't Zoot Suit Riot.  It is still superbly crafted and is a refreshing change of tempo from the run of the mill Christmas fare.  Since this song isn't really directly about the holiday, there isn't anything to object to.  Unless you will only put religious music in your playlist, there is no reason not to give this excellent song a try.  And if you are only looking for religious music, you don't need me to tell you this ain't it...","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Like others have said, if you go into this album with an open mind, and not try to compare it with the Pink Floyd classics of the 70's, you will probably like it.  If you liked \"The Division Bell\", and particularly, the instrumentals on that album (\"Marooned\" and \"Cluster One\") then you'll probably like this even more.  You don't get a lot of David Gilmour vocals here, but you do get a lot of his signature guitar playing, and that's where this album really shines.\n\nThis isn't a perfect album. 9 of the 18 tracks are less than 2 minutes and seem like mere sketches of something that could have been great if they had been developed into full songs with vocals.  The best songs here are the longer ones.  \"It's What We Do\", \"Sum\", and \"Talkin' Hawkin'\" are highlights, and \"Louder Than Words\" (the only song with vocals) is a nice way to end the album.\n\nAs for the bonus material on the blu-ray disc, it's not particularly interesting, or something I'd likely revisit a lot.  A lot of black and white footage of PF jamming in the studio, interspersed with old photos.  No behind the scenes documentary or interviews with Gilmour or Mason about the making of the album.  Although there is one song on the audio section called \"Nervana\" which is really good and really rocks out.  I'm not sure why this wasn't put on the album.\n\nSo overall, a very good Floyd album, though definitely not a classic.  It would have been nice to have more Gilmour vocals, but any Floyd in 2014 is better than none.","classification":4,"fold":0}

Last year, they offered us the title track of the EP \"Stole My Heart.\"  In December, as part of the \"25 Days of Free\" promotion, we got \"Winter Night.\"  Now Little & Ashley are back, with \"Thousand Falling Stars.\"\n\nThere's nothing earthshaking about this song, nothing groundbreaking.  It's a nice little pop song, with an electric guitar adding some energy to the breathy, mellow male vocals.  Perhaps because it's so very unpretentious, however, I couldn't help liking it - a lot.  Or maybe there's just something about the quiet joy of this song that reminds me of that moment when you realize you're falling in love, and anything seems possible.  \"A thousand falling stars in sight\/I'll catch them in my hat tonight\/With you\/I'll catch the stars with you.\"  It's nothing profound, to be sure, but it brings back fond memories and makes me smile.

After 'Crack the Skye' where could they go with the concept album, they'd done it as well as they could, in my opinion. So taking a dramatic left turn and making a very strong hard rock record made sense to me, it gave them the space to move forward in whatever way they wanted. And that is what they have done with this new one. Yes, there is some more straightforward 'radio' type songs on here, but  they still rock. And they have brought back some of the sludgy, heavy, quirky stuff. So it's a real mix of everything that this band has done so far. These guys are so good, and so deserving of success.

{"text":"They've done it again!  Another solid cover album from Pentatonix.  Avi, Kristie, Mitch, Kevin and Scott have done a wonderful job just singing their hearts out.  Taking  another page from their expanse of top 10 radio hits, and putting their creative spin on it is something to behold.  Vol. III gives us the future of PTX with their multifaceted acapella talents.  Kevin's beat-boxing, Mitch, Scott, and Kristie's harmonious ensemble are awe inspiring.  Avi's many talents are utilized especially with his deep, soulful, baritone that liven up this party.  PTX with their world tour, inspire so many of us to follow our dreams.  There's nothing foul or offensive that I can put my finger on.  The opening song Ariana Grande's \"Problem is funky, and Mitch's rap is well done.  The breakdown and transition to the end of the song is dope.  \"On My Way Home\" keeps the PTX train rolling home. Scott's lead vocals are impressive.  \"La La Latch\" has that club feel, and the gang's vocals are smoothly executed.  You've gotta' hear this track, to see what they've done.  I can't even put it into words, It's that cool!  On \"Rather Be\" Mitch and Kristie's voices are the icing on the cake. Boy do they sound great together!  Ari, Scott and Kevin's voices fill in the background phenomenally.  On track #5 \"See Through\" Mitch's Falsetto, and Soprano vocals are powerful, what emotion and feeling!  Track 6.  \"PapaOutai\" featuring Lindsey Stirling, has a Haitian flavored calypso, and tropical flavor all it's own.  Lindsey Stirling's violin makes the track complete.  It's great workout song.  I wasn't expecting Lindsey on this album, but it's another great collaboration for PTX.  What they did on the Imagine Dragon's cover for \"Radiation\"  was groundbreaking.  And this track capitalizes on that success and more.  Finally, the album comes to an end with \"Standing By\" is an alright track.  I think it could've been a little better.  It's a pretty short track.  With this release PTX shows that their still reaching new heights and aren't changing for the status quo.  Their still that fun loving quintet that breathes new inspiration into today's hit songs.  Great cover album with original music sprinkled throughout.  To have come this far by sharing their voice, is heartwarming, and unforgettable.  The world should celebrate the good times with PTX in the background.  What's even more awesome is the fact that I got this album a day before the release date.  And with auto-rip so I can listen to it whenever I want to!  Thanks Amazon.  Thank you Pentatonix for another great release!","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"It has been a very, very long time since we have really heard anything from Maxwell, musically and personally. He had promised at one point to make a trio of albums, after his past 8 year absence from the public eye from 2001-2009. When he did come back at that time, he released the acclaimed BlackSummers' Night, which garnered a few Grammy awards, and a set of really great songs in the process. Now, he is planning to come back with the follow-up to BlackSummers' Night, set to be released in July. Based on the lead single planned for that album, he definitely is in a good vision to his work. Lake By The Ocean, Maxwell's latest single definitely is a good soul song, that is really at the par of his classics that he had made before in his work like Fistful Of Tears, Wherever, Whatever, Wherever and Pretty Wings.. It really feels like a throwback to The Isley Brothers classic Voyage To Atlantis in sound, and definitely a compliment to Maxwell soulful satisfaction in his own work. This is a good download for die hard Maxwell fans, whom are eagerly awaiting his new works.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"After her radio-friendly first album that just seemed too much like it was hacked over and created by a producer, rather than an artist, Clarkson comes out with this track, the best from her album, and the best of her career thus far. This song really brings out the best of Clarkson, and to my knowledge, it's not a breakup song, so there's no anger, just plain Kelly and her vocals. The song is well-crafted, the lyrics are good, and the vocals shine.\n\nI'll always remember the song by a little moment I had with the song a few years back. Riding through Orlando, Florida at 4 o' clock in the morning, moving to my new house in NC, I was flipping through the radio and came to this song. And there I listened to it, in the back seat of a car, the lights of Orlando outside, and I just stared out my window. That's the atmosphere this song creates. And the song is a classic, and Clarkson's best in its own right.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Even at the incredibly low price of 99 cents for all of Bach's solo harpsichord music, I considered this set with some trepidation. This was because I remembered Galling's VoxBox recordings from the 1960s as sufficiently clear and accurate, but also rather hard-edged, literal-minded, and charmless. In fact, a friend described Galling's Bach as \"like a mathematical machine-gun,\" and my sense was that I was listening to a dodged musical plodder rather than a real musician.  Finally, however, given the low cost and the fact that the set contained a few pieces I didn't already own, I decided to bite the bullet.\n\nUnfortunately,  I'm afraid I don't care for Galling's performances any more now than I did in my college days. To my ears, his playing lacks the kind of poetry, rhythmic spring, or imaginative phrasing one finds in different ways in keyboardists like Leonhardt, Pinnock, Staier, Gould, Lipatti, Hewitt, Schiff, Horzowski, Richter, or my latest discovery, the pianist James Friskin who appears in Bach Guild's recently offered Bigger Bach Set.\n\nGalling is OK as background music, but when I listening to him with any attention for even a few minutes, I find myself \"changing channels\" to some performance I enjoy more. If you're new to Bach's wonderful keyboard music and pick up this set, don't make any final judgements about Bach until you hear his music played by one of the other keyboardists I've mentioned.\n\nVox did employ some very fine pianists back in the day, including Alfred Brendel, Abbey Simon, Walter Frankl, Walter Klien, Michael Ponti, and Jerome Rose (whose Liszt 'Annes de Plerinage' is quite extraordinary). You might like Galling's Bach more than I do, and for 99 cents you can't really go that far wrong. This review would be 1 or 2 stars if the price were higher. However, consider exploring some other performers before or after you've heard Galling's Bach.\n\nIf you're looking for REAL bargains, search out some of the alternate Vox performers mentioned above, and also check out Bach Guild's various Big Boxes (Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, Mozart, Hadyn, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Mahler, Tchaikovsky, etc, etc), which in my view are true must-buys.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"This truly is the best collection to get if you are a fan of CREAM. Unfortunately, I found out that I mustn't be a big Cream fan after thoroughly exploring this compilation. Sure, all the big hits (the FM staples) are here, Strange Brew, Sunshine Of Your Love, White Room, Crossroads, Badge, etc. There were even a couple (I Feel Free and Swlabr) that surprised me, but there were too many songs that I skipped. The live material was rather hit and miss for me. This is a gold collection? Well maybe I'm just spoiled being such a big DEEP PURPLE fan for so many years. Cream simply might not be my cup of tea, but I can clearly see that this is quite a good bargain for the \"true\" fan.\n\nIf I intrigued any Cream fan by my Deep Purple reference then check out the early Deep Purple first. There is a new compilation out by EMI called, Deep Purple \"The Early Years\" (7243 5966112 4). This great collection contains highlights of their first three albums 1968-1969 (the same time frame as Cream).

{"text":"With the minor exception of \"Hey Mambo\", none of these fifteen duets were hits; however, they are all good-to-great songs that make for a truly entertaining album.  The earliest is the CD closer \"The Last Duet\", from the long out-of-print \"Barry\" (1980).  It's a (fairly) funny, discofied parody of the then-rampant duet trend sung with Lily Tomlin (!).  Both jazzy duets from Barry's career landmark \"2:00 A.M. Paradise Cafe\" (1984) are included:  \"Big City Blues\" with Mel Torme (featuring Gerry Mulligan) and \"Blue\" with Sarah Vaughan.  \"Run To Me\" (1985) is from a Dionne Warwick LP called \"Finder of Lost Loves\"--named after a hit TV show of the time.  Actually, I never warmed up to Dionne's vocal on this song; I usually love her but something sounds off to me.  This was Barry's first pop single after \"2:00 A.M.\" and it failed to nick the Hot 100, reaching 12 on the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\n\"Hey Mambo\" and \"Summertime\" (with Dianne Schuur) are from the excellent pop\/jazz album \"Swing Street\" (1987).  \"Mambo\" put Kid Creole and the Coconuts on the Hot 100 for the only time, and Barry for the last time (so far--hope springs eternal).  It's a great dance number produced by Gloria Estefan's husband Emilio and is somewhat reminiscent of \"Conga\" and \"Rhythm Is Gonna Get You\".  \"Look To the Rainbow\" is a beautiful ballad with Barbara Cook from the 1991 CD \"Showstoppers\", which consisted of songs from Broadway shows.\n\nIn 1994, Barry did the soundtrack for an animated movie called \"Thumbelina\".  The single \"Let Me Be Your Wings\", with longtime backup singer (and sometime American Idol vocal coach) Debra Byrd actually dented the British pop chart at number 73.  The only song on this CD I never heard of before is \"Now and Forever\" with Sheena Easton.  The liner notes say this was \"released\" in 1995, but don't say what if any disc it comes from.  I have never heard Barry's voice more buried in echo than it is on this song.\n\nIf it had been released in 1977-1981, the Barbra Streisand duet \"I Won't Be the One To Let Go\" would have been an easy Top 10 pop hit.  In 2002, from Barbra's own \"Duets\" CD, it sank like a stone, not even making the AC chart.  A shame, because it's really pretty and the two megastars sound great together.  \"On a Slow Boat To China\" with Bette Midler from her \"Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook\" CD is very cute and plays on Barry and Bette's long history together.\n\nFinally, there are songs from each of Barry's \"Greatest Songs of the...\" CDs that marked an amazing album chart renaissance for him.  The Fifties CD that started it all became his first #1 album since \"Live\" in 1977.  It's nice to hear Phyllis McGuire still sounding good after all these years.  But the performance and arrangement of the Sixties CD's entry here, \"Cherish\/Windy\" with the venerable Association, is perhaps the most amazing song on this (or that) CD.  The two classics swoop around each other brilliantly as Barry and the Association harmonize like he was in on the original records with them.  I assume the group performed this with Barry and are not sampled.  But this is a fantastic song\/medley that deserves more attention than it's gotten.  The Seventies song is a remixed version (what's different from the original?  no idea) of \"You've Got a Friend\" with old friend Melissa Manchester, and from the Eighties CD comes \"Islands in the Stream\" with Reba McEntire.\n\nExcept for the Sheena duet, which I can't seem to get behind, this is all great stuff.  Not a reflection of Barry's hitmaking career, but a bunch of coulda been shoulda beens.  I think fans both casual and fanatical will really appreciate this CD.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"\"Meditations2Go\" are \"guided audio meditations featuring synchronized music and narration,\" each about 30 minutes in length. Each one is original and unique, with it's own sequencing and background music based upon a blend of traditional and contemporary meditation techniques. Being a new age music journalist for over 30 years as well as a music producer myself who has worked on a number of guided meditation recordings, I can say that, in my experience, \"Meditations2Go\" are some of the best I've heard. The series is the work of Rob Brookler, who has been a meditation teacher in the Los Angeles area for 28 years Having worked with many groups and individuals in that time, he draws from real life experience and has created a practical approach to not only focusing the mind, but on gaining insight into many of the issues that are prevalent in our day to day lives.\n\nOne of the things that impressed me the most about \"Meditations2Go\" is how well produced and professional they are. A standout feature for me is Rob's voice. His tone and timbre, as well as his pacing and cadence are about as perfect as you could want for something of this nature. He also has a wonderful ear for the kind of music that is best suited for each topic, and will even spend time in the studio with the soundtrack producer during the recording process to help tailor it for the particular meditation. Needless to say, I am very impressed with \"Meditations2Go\" and am greatly enjoying and benefiting from integrating their soothing ambiance and insightful narratives into my life.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Drake has a standard style to all his songs.  It usually involves him trying to be soft-spoken ladies man trying to woo his next conquest.  He often incorporates an atypical music component and, sometimes, has a featured female singer.  \"One Dance\" has all those 'Drake-ian' elements to it and the result is uninspiring.  The heavy-duty Drake fans won't listen to such blasphemy (after all, they did push it to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100), but an objective analysis has to be honest.\n\n  Drake's chosen musical component is an odd, auto-tuned series of exotic horns that seem over-produced.  While this part is mediocre, the real shortcoming is featured singer, Kyla.  While Kyla appears to have been around for several years and has had some success in the industry, her contribution to \"One Dance\" is just bad.  Her 'verses' simply do not match the flow of the song.  They are slow and disjointed and she is also trying too hard to be sexy.","classification":2,"fold":0}

Instead, Chris Martin's split with Gweneth Paltrow had taken full center stage, where the feeling of the songs just has missed the mark on strikes beyond what words could be said, like before. Still, the boys from England are trying to make some strides ahead, after a bulk of songs which didn't deliver on Mylo Xyloto. A Sky Full Of Stars, the second single from the lagging Ghost Stories album, actually is a better track for Coldplay, and brings in the classic sound Coldplay had been known for in some great before. It actually is a better track than the lost Magic shown. It is a jubilant song that is good, but not great. Still, I like the song well, and for any die hard Coldplay fan, this is a good song to download.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Remember when he sang :\"First we take Manhattan\", what does that song mean today? It's the power of great poetry that a poem changes its meaning as time goes by, it's a whole new poem. Then in his previous studio cd from 1992 he sings: \"I have seen the future and it is murder.\" but now in 2001 he sings about love, secret love, spiritual love and more love, just like he did in his first records. Cohen has done all the circle back and politics are not part of his persona in this cd. His voice grows just deeper, like John Lee Hooker in his last years, the voice is so deep it's like listening to someone singing from a well of from the other side of life. It's a great Leonard Cohen cd again. I am only in my second listening but I can feel this CD will grow on me and grow like all his CD's did in the last 30 years. A friend is back, there is hope for humanity! When I first opened this cd I was wondering if this was a Cohen cd or a series of duets with Shana Robinson, she cowrote all the songs, plays all the tracks on synth. and sings in all the songs. But this are not duets, her singing is more backsinging and although I can only guess I think the songs are 95% cohen and 5% Robinson. I don't know who Robinson is, her voice is sweet and completes the darkness of Cohen songs, but after all, this is a Leonard Cohen cd.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Dr. Dre is a living legend in the music industry and in a league of his own. While the likes of Puff Daddy and Jay-Z have ascended in the capital world with all of their business ventures, Dr. Dre is the only person who has been successful primarily off of his love for music. Everything he has done has always been music related as he is THE most influential producer in the world of Hip Hop. Dr. Dre has helped bring international attention to some of the biggest names in Hip Hop for the last 2 decades including Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 cent and most recently Kendrick Lamar. Needless to say, Dr. Dre doesnt even need to make music anymore. With his most recent business deal with Apple selling his Beats by Dre brand for $1 Billion, Dr. Dre has enough money for 100 lifetimes. But for the sake of his legacy in the music industry, Im guessing he felt obligated to give Hip Hop, and especially his longtime fans one more album before he throws in the towel. And here we have Compton: A Soundtrack by Dr. Dre\n\nIf you're a Hip Hop fan, you should know about the mythical Dr. Dre album that was supposed to have released years ago under the title DETOX. It has been 16 years since his last proper album 2001, released back in 1999. For years fans have been patiently waiting for Detox to drop up until the beginning of August where Dr. Dre has stated he has scrapped the entire project altogether, claiming that he was dissatisfied with the albums direction. According to Dr. Dre the filming of the autobiographical film Straight Outta Compton inspired him to create this album which is, in concept, a culmination of Dr. Dres homage to his humble hometown of Compton and his career as whole. There are 16 tracks on the album (ironically 1 track for every year Dr. Dre hasn't released an album) that ranges from modern trap style beats to freestyle Jazz and the undeniable G-Funk of which Dre is credited as the creator of.\n\nJust like every Dr. Dre album released prior to Compton, this album is filled with an exceptional amount of guest appearances including the usual suspects Snoop Dogg, and Eminem; up and coming artists King Mez, Jon Conner and Justus; and some of the Westcoast OGs including Ice Cube, Xzibit and Cold 187um. However the artists that are most frequent on the album are Kendrick Lamar, R&B soulstress Marsha Ambrosius, King Mez and Compton artist Anderson. Paak who appear on at least 3 tracks or more per person. Every track Kendrick Lamar is vocally present on; Genocide, Deep Water, and Darkside\/Gone are some of the most conceptually lyrical songs accompanied with the most experimental production. You have swift instances of production harking back to his original G-Funk style with songs like Talking to My Diary, Its All on Me and All in a Days Work which are some of the albums highlights.  However I cannot forget to mention the songs Issues and Loose Cannon which features former NWA member Ice Cube and the (now) low key Xzibit. These songs in particular showcase the most aggressive flows I have ever heard from Dr. Dre and stellar performances from both Ice Cube and Xzibit. The song Medicine Man with protg Eminem, has Eminem rapping in his old Slim Shady persona and another standout song on the album; and 100 times better than the  mediocre I Need a Doctor song released a couple of years ago.\n\nI cant say that this album can compare to either The Chronic or 2001, mainly because this is an entirely different beast that sounds nothing like anything Dr. Dre has done before. but I can sincerely say that this album is great in its own right. The only complaint I have with Compton is the choice of collaborators Dre decided to put on the album. All of Dr. Dres albums are infamously known for having a myriad of guest features, but I feel I couldve done without the likes of King Mez and maybe a track or two less of Marsha Ambrosius and Anderson. Paak. While I do admire Dr. Dre keeping the album consistent by letting all of these artists shine throughout the album, they tend to overstay their welcome just a little bit. Also, Dr. Dres flows on a lot of these songs are a little too similar to the artists that are featured on the album and I would have preferred if he didn't always have a superfast cadence while he is rapping. Overall I enjoyed this album and if this is indeed Dr. Dres last album, I am satisfied.\n\nFavorite 5:\n1) Animals (feat. Anderson. Paak)\n2) Talking to My Diary\n3) Its All on Me (feat. Justus & BJ the Chicago Kid)\n4) Genocide (feat. Marsha Ambrosius, Kendrick Lamar & Candice Pillay)\n5) All in a Days Work (feat. Anderson. Paak & Marsha Ambrosius)","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Yeah, the '80s may have watered it down with excessive layers of synthesizers and the general favoring of style over substance. Sure, the '90s have all but stomped it out due to the ubiquitous presence of hip-hop's \"dark\" side (heavily-programmed instruments, blatant sampling, offensive lyrics, bad singing). However, thanks to budding artists like Kem Owens, soul music has finally come around full-circle after 20+ years of musical diarrhea.\n\nKem's sparkling debut should truly set the standard in terms of what to look for in good soul music: REAL INSTRUMENTS (played by REAL MUSICIANS, of course), REAL SONGS (inspired, meaningful lyrics and solid composition skills), and REAL SINGING ABILITY (knowing HOW to sing in addition to having vocal talent). If more and more artists today would just adhere to these relatively simple guidelines, then there wouldn't be so much bad music out there to begin with. An album containing a few hit singles and a load of filler doesn't do it for me. That's why I'm recommending 'Kemistry' to ANYONE who honestly craves good music without the hype to go with it.\n\np.s. It's no wonder why most reviewers on here keep giving this album 5 stars.

{"text":"While this is a pretty decent compilation, it's just too uneven.  It has far too many songs from certain albums and not enough from others.  It's got 8 (!) songs from Flaming Pie, while other albums like \"Run Devil Run\", \"Driving Rain\", \"Flowers in the Dirt\", and all the live albums have nothing at all.  From my understanding, the only reason there are no songs from \"Flowers in the Dirt\" is because the remastering wasn't complete yet.  Then why not just wait?  That album was the commercial and critical comeback for McCartney, and it contained many great songs (My Brave Face, Put it There, This One, and Figure of Eight, and We Got Married were all standouts).\n\nOther essential songs are missing as well:  Spies Like Us, Once Upon a Long Ago, So Bad, Take it Away, Give Ireland Back to the Irish, etc.  Instead they've included some odd choices like Bip Bop, Good Times Coming, Temporary Secretary, and a few too many songs from \"New\".  And then there's the edits and remixes.\n\nOther people have complained about the lack of Beatles songs.  McCartney has plenty of great solo songs to fill 4 CD's without including The Beatles.  A few \"live\" versions of Beatles songs could easily have been used.  \"The Long and Winding Road\" from \"Wings Over America\", or maybe \"Hey Jude\" from \"Tripping the Live Fantastic\" would have been nice.  Regardless, there is nothing here.  With a better track list, this could have been an awesome box set.  Instead, it's just an okay one.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"The 80's was the decade of great Christian music.  Stryper led the way and several other bands followed.  Barren Cross, Bloodgood, Holy Soldier, and Guardian set a new direction and gave musical hope for a multitude of young people who grew tired of what passed for \"music\" in that generation.  One band that rose up during those formative years was Sacred Warrior.  What made this band special was their no-nonsense lyrics that confronted listeners with the biblical gospel.  They were never afraid of confronting sin and speaking plainly about the problem of evil.  SW eventually broke up and went their separate ways.\n\nAlmost thirty years later, Sacred Warrior has returned with a new lead singer and a fresh, updated sound.  Their new album, Waiting in Darkness has all of the features described above.  The only difference is this: The music is faster and the rock is heavier.  In fact, this is their heaviest album to date.  It should come as no surprise that this brain-rattling music is accompanied by the same non-compromising approach to the gospel.  Each song on the album is a testimony to the gospel of grace.\n\nTrack by Track:\n\nThe album begins by addressing the problem of evil and the reality of redemption:\n\nDesperately wicked we are born\nCorrupted seeds\nThis stronghold grips humanity\nThe curse of sin\n\nFlesh and spirit raging on the war within\nLife or death cursed or blessed the choice is given\nIn the perfect sacrifice a hope remains\nRedemption by shedding of blood love overcame\n\nThe title track, Waiting in Darkness is a heavy metal exposition of spiritual warfare:\n\nThrough your anger they fuel the fire\n Feeding off of your flesh's sinful desires\nLies and confusion your faith put to the test\nFocusing in on all of your weaknesses\nWe must be vigilant to thwart their evil plight\nBe strong in the lord and in the power of his might\nBe prepared for war\n\nIn Dust and Ashes is a Job-like lament written in the first person that is sure to grip the attention of anyone who is enduring a dark night of the soul:\n\nOh lord hear my cry\nI'm a man with many troubles\nIn the regions dark and deep\nThis world lies heavy on me\n\nYour steadfast love remains\nEven though I feel abandoned\nInvade my soul\nBreak the chains of doubt and sorrow\n\nSkin for skin all that I am\nWill bless your name in you remain\n\nIn dust and ashes I repent\nResolved to make you my content\nIn dust and ashes I confess\nMy love for you within this test\n\nFear Me is a bold declaration of the sovereignty of God.\n\nI speak and the waves obey I am governed by none,\nsovereign over all  Wisdom begins and ends with me\nAll authority is mine and I'll put an end to evil's reign\nFor vengeance is mine says the lord\n\nFear me like you'd fear a raging fire\nYou'd never run into the flames\nRespect keeps you from the pain\nOr the raging of the ocean\nYou'd never jump into the waves  and sink to your grave\nFear me\n\nTo deny that I exist\nSuppress the truth for a lie professing to be wise\nThe wrath I hold will be revealed\nThis world I will destroy\nJudging all who reject my name\n\nFans of A.W. Pink will immediately wonder if the guys in Sacred Warrior have been meditating on the classic, The Sovereignty of God!\n\nLong Live the King continues to confront the listener with the sovereignty of God over all things.\n\nHe is the lightning he is on high\nAlways and eternal and his love will never die\nHe is forever the answer to the rhyme\nOf what will be for you and me before the start of time\n\nI hear the thunder I hear the call\nThe armies of his angels from the royal temple hall\nOne day is a thousand years, still he's drawing nigh\nLift up your voice unto the sky shout the battle cry\n\nLong live the king, Long live the king\n\nJealous Love is a ballad that glories in the Cross of Christ.\n\nDay of the Lord is the token eschatological metal anthem and is rerecorded from their first studio album, Rebellion.  This one is a real blast from the past!  This is the kind of music that put Sacred Warrior on the map.\n\nFans of Sacred Warrior will only be encouraged by their latest record.  The music is tight, sounds current, best of all - exalts the Lord Jesus Christ!","classification":4,"fold":0}

I had those kick ass sounding old school Craig headphones with that kick ass bass and treble. Sammy Hagar had a voice of the hard rock bands and only Sammy could hit the pinnacle with \"There's Only One Way To Rock\" to become Rocks best!

It is the very first recordings from rhythm guitarist\/vocalist Susanna Hoffs, drummer\/vocalist Debbi Peterson, lead guitarist\/vocalist Vicki Peterson, and then-bassist Annette Z.  (Michael Steele would join the band in 1984 and eventually left in 2007.)\n\nThis is the first raw, unpolished, rock 'n' roll taste of what the sweet, choral harmonies of the Southern California all-girl band sounded like in 1981 before they hit it big 5 years later with the Prince-penned \"Manic Monday\" and mega-smash \"Walk Like An Egyptian.\"  2 of the songs, \"Getting Out Of Hand\", and \"Call On Me\", were previously released as B-sides to the band's 2003 single \"Something That You Said.\"  2 delicious, savory live tracks, along with several demos, are also included on this disc.

The off tempo guitar riffs and hard rocking blues from Keith Richards and Ronnie Woods is timeless and sharp, the solid rhythm section of Watts and Wyman rounds it off to a blistering piece of music. Then you add the icing to the cake with Mick Jagger at his grueling, bluesy, deep throttleing best and you have yourself another Stones classic. It's one of a handful of songs I can hit the replay button on over and over again and never get tired of hearing it. So crank it up, it needs to be loud to enjoy this in all its glory.

{"text":"A 1976 song about being on the road and feeling just a bit lost and out of place, \"Couldn't Get It Right\" just hooks you right in the beginning with a catchy rhythm and then never lets you go.\n\nWritten for their album Gold Plated on short notice to create a radio-playable song, it eventually topped out at #3 on the Hot 100 chart.  Apparently, the band was inspired by their time on the road, with the line about looking for signs in the night reflecting their search for a hotel with vacancies so they could sleep after a performance.\n\nListening to it today, it's marvelous.  Couldn't Get It Right is one of those songs that when it comes on, you think, \"Who sings that? I really like it.\"  It has a great opening beat and guitar riff, with a chrous that makes you feels like a fish on a hook, drawn into singing along.\n\nIt's great just to listen to, but I love driving to this song.

{"text":"In a lot of ways, Kevin Parker reminds me of Elliot Smith. Musically? No. But aesthetically, yes. Like Elliot Smith, Kevin Parker writes songs that feel lonely. Isolated. Also like Elliot Smith, Parker's songs come from a place deep down inside of himself. The outside world is of no concern to Kevin Parker. The world in his head is where he writes from. But unlike Elliot Smith, I don't believe Kevin Parker is sad about being alone. Kevin Parker isn't a tortured soul. He's just an old soul. And from that technicolor landscape deep in Kevin Parker's head is where the excellent new album Lonerism comes from. A place where John Lennon joined Blue Cheer and commited himself to acid head trip jams and Sid and Marty Krofft directed episodes of Little House on the Prairie. Tie-dyed tees and bean bag chairs. Schwinn Stingrays and key parties. Parker isn't old enough to have experienced the 70s, so he's re-creating them one album at a time. This time out he's perfected them.\n\n`Be Above It' starts the album out with a looped voice repeating \"Gotta be above it\" continuously, along with a looped drum part before Parker comes and turns this song into an anthem of sorts. A PSA straight from Perth, Australia. At first listen it's odd, but after you hear it 2 or 3 times it becomes this almost beautiful mantra. `Endors Toi' has that windswept stoicism that permeated Tame Impala's excellent Innerspeaker. `Apocalypse Dreams' sounds like a lost Lennon track. A mix of `A Day In The Life' and Plastic Ono Band idealism with a pinch of THC for good measure. `Mind Mischief' has a great rock `n roll groove by way of Marc Bolan. Then once you get midway into this excellent album you are hit with three amazing acid-tinged pop tracks. `Music To Walk Home By', `Why Won't They Talk To Me' and `Feels Like We Only Go Backwards' are some of the catchiest pop songs you will likely hear this year. Parker shows what a true pop music revivalist he is at heart. `Keep On Lying' is in a class of it's own. It's a long, strange meditation on Parker's own headspace. Who's he lying to? Us? Himself? It doesn't matter cause I dig his lies. Every single one of them. The fact that Kevin Parker's voice reminds me of a younger, reincarnated John Lennon only adds to the love I'm feeling for Tame Impala right now. Parker breaks out the riff strut of `Elephant' to pull us out of our LSD-daze, if just for a moment. It's about as rocking as it gets in Tame Impala country. Much like the Innerspeaker track `Island Walking'(sadly not included on the vinyl version), `Elephant' grabs ahold with a monster guitar riff that lives up to the song's namesake. Much like `Runways, Houses, City, Clouds' on Innerspeaker, `Nothing That Has Happened So Far Has Been Anything We Could Control' is the epic, existential moment on an already epic record. I'll spare you a long explanation of what it means, cause I don't know.  In one word: transcendence.\n\nTame Impala have given us a gift in Lonerism. Perth, Australia has given us a gift in Kevin Parker. Lonerism seems to be a state of mind. A state of mind where it's okay to be alone. A place where you're comfortable with the ghosts of the past and the visions of a place that has never really existed come together to make a technicolor dream you needn't wake from.\n\nKevin Parker may be alone, but never lonely.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"For years, Wilco albums have shown up in my Amazon Recommendations (they still do), but I've honestly never taken the time to sit down and listen to an album.  After Jeff Tweedy released his first solo record, I thought he'd parted ways with the band and that they wouldn't be making music anymore.  Then 'Star Wars' got released, and I decided it was time to get my first Wilco album.  I mean, ain't nothing cheaper than something free, right?\n\nI'm a big fan and supporter of indie music.  Granted, it seems like it gets harder and harder to define what's \"indie\" anymore, but what I like is bands that aren't afraid to experiment with new ideas or challenge our perception of genre labels.  I think that's why Amazon has been trying to get me to listen to Wilco for all these years.  And, after having listened to 'Star Wars' several times, I can see why.\n\nBeing my first Wilco album, I had no idea what to expect.  As overused a term as \"indie\" is, \"alternative\" is an even more overused term when describing music.  What was \"alternative\" when the term was coined isn't \"alternative\" anymore, so I try to avoid using it whenever possible.  However, seeing as how Wilco began back in 1994, I think it's an appropriate use of the term.  Tweedy & Co. definitely push the \"alternative\" envelope by experimenting with non-traditional sounds and elements into their music.  They are clearly a very diverse and talented group of musicians, and it's no wonder they've been as successful a band as they've been.\n\nWhile this is my first Wilco album, it's hard for me to pinpoint any particular songs I can identify as my favorite.  Will this be my only Wilco album?  Maybe, unless I decide to sit down and listen to the rest of their recordings.  One down, eight to go....","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Never understood the distain that John Cale has for Honi Soit a blistering set of rock tunes played by a killer band. Cale, perhaps, felt that this didn't quite live up to what he wanted it to be but, to my ears and sensibility, it remains a classic slice of Cale with blistering lyrics and his voice is, at turns, husky and deep or shrill depending on what emotion he's trying to convey. Mind you, shrill for Cale can be a good thing--it matches the music here in many cases.\n\nThis new reissue (and remastered) edition of Honi Soit has a much stronger bass than the original CD--it isn't bloated at least to my ears but adds some bite and attack to the music. There may be a small amount of digital compression used based on some of the comparisons I've seen but, in a rare case of more is more, it adds to the music for me with this album. The original German pressing has a lighter touch to be sure. The comparison for me is a cool side walk perfectly uniform and fairly smooth while this reminds me more of a recently paved road on a hot day--you can feel the gravel under your feed but it isn't unpleasant.\n\nThis reissue (an import from Holland) doesn't have any extensive liner notes discussing the making of the album just features credits (no re-mastering credit though) for the musicians with photos on a two page spread and noting who played what instrument. I realize there are albums that Cale probably isn't completely happy with but they are a part of his past and should remain in print since they were put out there in the first place. Pretending they don't exist doesn't mean they don't and even \"Caribbean Sunset\" has its moments and should be available on CD and legit downloads.\n\nThis remains a worthy reissue and essential album for Cale fans. Now let's get the other albums that are out of print out there again. Even lesser gems and allow fans to appreciate Cale as imperfect art can sometimes be more interesting than a perfect masterpiece.\n\nCale has always been a challenging and innovative musician. I'd love to see him work with Brian Eno once again as they struck gold in the past with their collaboration on \"Wrong Way Up\".","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Willie Nelson duets with a woman on each song on this album.  Most of the women are country singers, not surprisingly.  Several of the songs had previously been recorded by Willie not as duets.  It's fairly common now for an aging singer to re-record his old songs as duets, but this album works better than most of those kinds of albums do.  The singers are well chosen and (mostly) blend well with Willie's voice.  But it would have been nice to have Alicia Keys do a duet with Willie.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Singer, Songwriter and Musician Eric Benet found himself at a personal and professional crossroads. In spite of a decade that had began with great promise, thanks to his gold-selling and Grammy-nominated Tamia duet, \"Spend My Life With You,\" his reputation as low-key R&B love man was nearly destroyed thanks to acknowledged infidelity against his then-wife, actress Halle Berry. His third CD, the intensely-emotional Hurricane, finally ended his six year recording hiatus and produced a couple of hits, but he didn't completely restore the groove until 2008's Grammy-nominated follow-up, Love & Life. Now, over a decade into his solo career and nearly a decade removed from Hallegate, Mr. Benet's fifth effort, Lost In Time, feels just as well-crafted as its predecessor, giving his faithful following exactly what they expect---lush, love-struck ballads and mid tempos featuring twists of sophistication and sensuality.\n\nWhen Mr. Benet entered the studio for Love..., he confessed (during an interview to SoulTracks, no less) that he'd sequestered himself in the studio with longtime collaborators George Nash and Demonte, employing old school methods to crank out melodies for the songs rather than the other way around. The process of anchoring lyrics to a strong musical foundation continues to serve him well, evidenced in vintage-sounding tracks like \"Always a Reason,\" which could've been an outtake from a Stylistics album in the way it interpolates \"Break Up to Make Up\" and employs a tender falsetto to coax his way into a reluctant heart: \"There's a lifetime of tears we could both leave behind, cuz' in so many ways, we've been broken inside\/All the questions you ask, we'll find answers together in time , all you need is to believe...\"\n\n\"Never Want to Live Without You\" is another blue-light-basement-party special, filled with confessions of a man who's wronged his lady and vows to move faithfully into a brighter future.  The exquisite title track describes the heady sensation that new love creates, and vulnerability reaches new heights with the aching slow-burn of a ballad, \"Sometimes I Cry,\" brimming with tear-stained, Prince-worthy pleading for another chance (or at least a fresh box of Kleenex): \"There's a smile on my face, yeah, but I'm broken inside\/Sometimes I cry, when I'm all alone with this heart of mine. \"\n\nEven the most successful performers need to shake things up from time to time, and that's what Mr. Benet accomplishes, surprisingly, on the Gamble-and-Huff-recalling \"Paid.\" What could've been an ill-fitting and self-conscious duet is, instead, a freely funky jam that laments having more month than money and how the lean green is getting harder and harder to come by. Eddie Levert's baritone complements Mr. Benet's tenor as they grumble about getting \"paid on the first, paid on the last, and struggle all through the middle\/M-O-N-E-Y never seems to multiply for me,\" a rich experience for the singers and the audience alike.\n\nStill, in spite of its overall excellence, a few songs in the line-up manage to fall short. \"Take It,\" which pairs him with Chrisette Michele, sounds like a tentative I-don't-want-to-outshine-him\/her vocal run instead of the fun frolic it was meant to be, and \"Good Life,\" featuring Ledisi, has a great message but needs a more modern backdrop to really drive it home. \"Something's Wrong\" wants to wrap up the collection with a conscience, but it seems to contradict itself in stating that, yes, the whip is fly and the cash is flowing, yet the evidence of mankind's suffering isn't exactly making his day, thank you very much: \"I avert my eyes as I travel them roads, of people begging on the street\/Don't mess up my vibe and show another sick child ain't had enough to eat.\" Huh?\n\nMore nuanced than Hurricane, but less exuberant than Love & Life, Lost in Time---even with its missteps---powerfully demonstrates Mr. Benet's artistic assurance and finesse, qualities that will keep the Milwaukee, WI native from becoming, well, just that.","classification":5,"fold":0}

I will look forward to its intro of a low volume distant repeated guitar chord followed by loud semi crunchy guitars and back ground harmonized ohhhh's.  Then comes some pensive church organ as the singer tells the listener he might make some mistakes but he's got your back. And then it gets louder with driving guitars and some nicley harmonized background vocals. Nice teaser to make me wonder about the rest of the cd.\n\nI must admit when I heard the ohhhhh ohhhhh's that it made me want to compare them to every performer from the Beatles to Katy Perry but I restrained myself and managed to focus on this particular song.

Artpop is much better because it pushes boundaries not just for the sake of being provocative pretentiously but because Artpop dares to tear down walls and break boundaries with highly charged sexual energy in a great way.  I say this because this cd while definitely excellent isn't really breaking new ground especially.  I would say there are a handful of stand out songs that are absolutely amazing and that the other songs are at the very least good.  In other words, you cannot go wrong buying this especially if you are already a Katy Perry fan, she has one of the best voices in music today.  In both cases Artpop and Prism I have no idea why male rap is thrown in; if I want a rap cd I will buy one but that is my only complaint.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"The pointblank outpouring of the feminine soul - in a state of anguish & mourning - receives its full measure in this exceptional classic \"Un-break My Heart\"; sung with truly unique voice inflections & intonations by Toni Braxton; composed & written by Diane Eve Warren. We hear our heroine pleading for and commanding her deceased or departed lover to return to her immediately to assauge her loss and hurt, \"Don't leave me in all this pain, Don't leave me out in the rain...\" The use of the imperative is so forceful and direct, it heightens the impact of the song, and renders us as wrung out with catharsis - as she is.\n\nBraxton's soft, silky utterances easily immerse the listener in the strength and power of her heavier vocal chords - when she pours it on, \"Say you'll love me again, Undo this hurt you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life; Un-cry these tears, I cried so many nights...Un-break my heart!\" The excellent video for this song with its dramatic intensity lifts this rendition into being scene- and plot-driven, like \"Mourning Becomes Electra\" with the lights turned down.\n\nThis in turn builds plot and 'grief' motif within 'surround sound' orchestration. Braxton's intensity, her passionate request for her lover to return - becomes one of the more powerful crescendos in pop music. This would not be so - if her lips were sealed - they had to be un-sealed - her depth of expression from deep within her soul - may cause us to grieve (our catharsis, her purge of emotion). We listen to her final refrain and empathize with her loss. It is quite satisfying if not exhausting. We hope to be drenched in her emotional denouement upon re-playing this cinematic song. It is yours to enjoy when the mood is right.\n\n\"Bring back the nights when I held you beside me\nUn-break my heart\nSay you'll love me again\nUndo this hurt you caused\nWhen you walked out the door\nAnd walked out of my life\nUn-cry this tears\nI cried so many, many nights\nUn-break my\nUn-break my heart oh baby\nCome back and say you love me\nUn-break my heart\nSweet darlin'\nWithout you I just can't go on\nCan't go on....\"","classification":5,"fold":0}

It reminds me of a hybrid of about half a dozen different Madonna songs, such as \"Music\" \"Into The Groove\" \"Holiday\" \"Everybody\" \"Spotlight\" and even \"Erotica.\" It's just so inviting and fun. My favorite part is when Madonna laughs because she has such an honest laughter that is so real and genuine. \"Celebration\" is for both old and newschool fans because the Queen of Pop mixes both the creative and the created like the master artist that she is now famed for. Every time I listen to this song all different images of Madonna over the years flash in my mind, it's like Madonna's life story in 3 minutes set to music. This is the very first MP3 that I ever downloaded, I feel so old. But Madonna is well worth it.

It features Beegie Adair and some friends, and each of these tracks is a pure musical gem. This sampler offers us the following tracks:\n\n1. Alexander's Ragtime Band, featuring Beegie Adair on piano\n2. Shine On Harvest Moon , featuring guitarist, bassist, and producer Jack Jezzro\n3. A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody, featuring Beegie Adair on piano\n4. Scarborough Fair, featuring the smooth trumpet work of Leif Shires\n5. Avalon, featuring the orchestration prowess of the Jeff Steinberg Orchestra\n6. You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It), with Beegie Adair on piano & and vocals by Jaimee Paul\n7. Midnight in Rio, featuring Jack Jezzro's jazz guitar\n8. They Didn't Believe Me, with Beegie Adair performing a jazz classic\n9. Room With a View, featuring Sam Levine on saxophone\n10. Fascination Waltz, with Beegie Adair on piano and David Davidson on violin\n11. Bill Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home, a classic with Sam Levine on saxophone\n12. My Melancholy Baby (feat. Beegie Adair), featuring Jaimee Paul's exquisite vocals\n\nThe twelve tracks here are truly top notch, with some excellent and well seasoned jazz performers, and it was a stroke of production genius to build this album around Beegie Adair.  For those unfamiliar with her work, this is a good place to start. Beegie Adair is a jazz pianist. She studied piano at Western Kentucky University and moved to Nashville, where she did graduate work at Peabody College. She later went on to form the Beegie Adair Trio, and that's where we find most of her best works.\n\nBut this is also a good introduction to each of the jazz artists on this sampler, and it's a really keeper, that for this listener will be listened to for many hours. Thank you to both Green Hill and Amazon for an excellent sampler, one of the smoothest and best free jazz compilations that I've found here.\n\n9\/10\/2012","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Think back to the music scene in the mid 1960's and to all of that energy! There was music by The Beatles, the British Invasion and all those dynamite tunes being cranked out by Motown. But there was another group on the scene that somehow managed to crank it up yet another notch. Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels exploded onto the scene in late 1965 and over the next 18 months had a fabulous run of raucous, driving hit records that included \"Jenny Take A Ride\", \"Sock It To Me Baby\" and a driving remake of Bill Medley's \"Little Latin Lupe Lu\". The granddaddy of them all however was the group's 1966 hit \"Devil With A Blue Dress On & Good Golly Miss Molly\". This song has been cited by the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as one of \"The Songs That Shaped Rock & Roll\".","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Another decade has passed in the career of the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band, and they're celebrating the 50th anniversary of their founding in 1962. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Company are pushing 70, but the group has decided to go out with a bang. They're staging five arena shows on both sides of the Atlantic and putting out a new, feature-length, autobiographical documentary called \"Crossfire Hurricane\" with archival footage from the 60s and 70s narrated by the band. They've reconstructed and restored the first-ever Rolling Stones documentary, \"Charlie Is My Darling,\" filmed in Ireland in 1965, and published a 352-page \"photographic biography\" entitled \"The Rolling Stones 50.\" Finally, they're offering six (count 'em, six!) chronological greatest hits albums: a budget two-CD, a standard three-CD, a deluxe three-CD, a deluxe Blu-Ray, a deluxe vinyl five-LP, and a super deluxe five-CD\/one-EP collection. Each set offers the same two new studio recordings -- good ones, dammit! If you have money to burn and don't mind making some of the richest men in the world just a bit richer, there's almost no limit to what you can spend on the Stones' music and memorabilia this year.\n\nThe best-of compilations are expertly remastered, albeit selectively edited for length, so while newer listeners probably won't notice anything amiss, nostalgic fans might. The first two discs of the standard version (33 out of 50 tracks) cover the Stones' early career, revisiting most of the required hits from the 60s to the mid-70s. Starting with their very first single, a 1963 cover of Chuck Berry's \"Come On,\" the band includes music from their singles and studio albums up to \"Black and Blue\" in 1976. The third disc contains 17 recordings from the 1978 album \"Some Girls\" (though not the title track) to their final studio album in 2005, \"A Bigger Bang,\" plus the aforementioned new songs, \"Doom and Gloom\" and \"One More Shot,\" both of which harken back to the rough classic sound of the Stones. A 12-page booklet is enclosed.\n\nHow does the three-CD set compare to \"Forty Licks,\" the two-disc, 40-track, 40th-anniversary collection? It's far better. Of the four new tunes on that non-chronological 2002 album, only \"Don't Stop\" is recycled; 33 of the 36 remaining cuts are included on \"GRRR!\" (absent are \"Mother's Little Helper,\" \"Shattered,\" and \"You Got Me Rocking\"). These 33 are supplemented with a couple of mid-60s covers, Buddy Holly's \"Not Fade Away\" and Howlin' Wolf's \"Little Red Rooster,\" and enough important songs from the Glimmer Twins to make a more satisfying package: \"Time Is on My Side,\" \"Heart of Stone,\" \"As Tears Go By,\" \"Rocks Off,\" \"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker),\" \"Respectable,\" \"Waiting on a Friend,\" \"Harlem Shuffle,\" \"Streets of Love,\" and others. As wonderful as the music is, though, it's not perfect; several relatively weak choices (\"We Love You,\" \"She Was Hot,\" \"Highwire\") take the place of terrific songs like \"Let It Bleed,\" \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking,\" and \"Dead Flowers,\" which are nowhere to be found.\n\nIf you'd like this set with five postcards commemorating various tours and a 36-page hardcover book instead of the 12-page booklet, buy the Deluxe Edition; if you'd prefer it in a different format, both five-LP and imported Blu-Ray versions are available. And if money's no object, there's the huge Super Deluxe Edition: a 12-by-17-inch box containing four CDs with 80 hits and album cuts and covers, a five-track CD of the Stones' very first unreleased demos, a four-track vinyl EP of an unreleased BBC Radio session, a 96-page hardcover book with photos of various ephemera, a reproduction of an early poster from the Ricky Tick Club (an influential R&B venue on the outskirts of London), in addition to the 36-page book and the five postcards. The 89 super deluxe cuts encompass covers of the Beatles' \"I Wanna Be Your Man,\" O.V. Wright's \"That's How Strong My Love Is,\" and Bob Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone\" as well as more hits and favorite performances not included on the three-disc set: \"I'm Free,\" \"Play with Fire,\" \"Mother's Little Helper,\" \"Lady Jane,\" \"Honky Tonk Women,\" \"Midnight Rambler,\" \"You Got the Silver,\" \"Bitch,\" \"Dance Little Sister,\" \"Shattered,\" \"Far Away Eyes,\" \"She's So Cold,\" \"Rough Justice,\" \"Rain Fall Down,\" etc.\n\nCompilations will never take the place of individual albums from the Rolling Stones' peak years, and they'll never please longtime fans like me who have no need for obvious radio fodder and want the rare stuff and the live stuff instead. There aren't a lot of surprises in these boxes, and the editing and inevitable omissions also reduce their value (where are \"Live with Me\" and \"Star Star\" and \"Hang Fire\" and a dozen more?), so I'm giving them only four stars. The two-CD set earns just three stars as it's even skimpier, dropping 10 songs from the three-CD set: \"Time Is on My Side,\" \"Heart of Stone,\" \"Under My Thumb,\" \"We Love You,\" \"She's a Rainbow,\" \"Highwire,\" \"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker),\" \"She Was Hot,\" \"Streets of Love,\" and \"Rocks Off.\" But if you're in the market for greatest hits, something to remind you of the Stones' awesome talent and staying power over the years, then these boxes are the best you're going to do for now -- though of course you could assemble your own list of fave mp3s and burn a set of CDs for yourself.\n\nSince Amazon has not listed the tracks of the super deluxe set, I will. I've indicated the 14 edited tracks.\n\nCD 1\n1. Come On\n2. I Wanna Be Your Man\n3. Not Fade Away\n4. That's How Strong My Love Is\n5. It's All Over Now\n6. Little Red Rooster\n7. The Last Time\n8.

The introduction of grunge, rap, and other music was hard to get use to. In 1992 along come a great song from Alannah Myles, BLACK VELVET. I thought the music of the 1990's is not lost we have a winner. The reason why I love this song is the lyrics beat, and it has something for everybody. It is a song that is a blend of Pop\/Country, the beat is a blend and the lyrics to me is more pop. So if U hate Pop music you will still love this song and vice-versa with those who dis-like Country music like me. I guarantee you will get attached to this song regardless with music you prefer, so enjoy.\n\nTHX,\nKris L. CocKayne","classification":4,"fold":0}

By the way, this is not necessarily my kind of music.  I was never the biggest fan of theirs.  This album, believe it or not, makes me more of a fan than I was in their prime!

Also check out the politically-charged, pro-revolutionary Small Axe; Duppy Conqueror, with great harominies; Pass It On; and the call for unity One Foundation. I'd call Hallelujah Time the weakest of the bunch. But as for the rest? It's all good. BUY IT!

{"text":"This essential country music album is a triumph for all who participated in its success:  producer Owen Bradley (whose lush, tasteful written strings pour sorrow on \"Sweet Dreams\" and \"Why Can't He Be  You\") pianist Floyd Cramer and a first-class Nashville session band  (whose piano introductions to \"Crazy,\" \"She's Got You,\"  and \"I Fall To Pieces\" are among the most treasured in music),  and, of course, Patsy Cline herself.\nMany have attempted to copy Patsy  Cline's vocal range or stylistic ticks; Reba McEntire, k.d. lang and Mandy  Barnett being only among the more successful. But something about ballads  brought out the pain and emotional desolation in Cline's voice that few  C&W singers then or now could match. Listen to her sing the rather  trite line \"I've been so wrong for so long,\" and hear the sorrow,  anger and regret scribbled into her delivery. Hear her line, \"You  don't love me, it's plain,\" and tears nearly well up as if you're  hearing this with her for the first time. Compare her reading of the line,  \"I've got your memory, or has it got me?\" with Jimmy Buffett's  sloppy, careless version on \"Fruitcakes,\" and you'll see who is  the better musical caretaker.\nNearly every song on the LP fits that  model, as Cline and her stellar support keep the spirit, if not letter, of  what country music is and should be to its fans.

{"text":"In 2005, Sony released without much or any fanfare the terrific \"Essential Michael Jackson\", which easily is the best Michael Jackson compilation available these days. It also released a slightly different international version, which I recently picked up while in China. No, I didn't buy it from a pirated-CD hawking character on some street corner. In fact I bought it in a regular CD store in Shanghai, for all of 39 RMB (about US$ 5.50), if you can believe that.\n\nThe international version of \"The Essential Michael Jackson\" (2 CDs, 38 tracks, 156 min.) differs only slightly from the US version:\n\n1. The Jacksons' \"Can You Feel It\" replaces \"Enjoy Yourself\" (an improvement);\n2. Somehow \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" (from \"Bad\") is lumped along with (and in the middle of) the \"Thriller\" songs on CD1, obviously not an improvement;\n3. The title track from \"Dangerous\" is left off, and instead 2 tracks from 1995's \"HIStory\" second CD of new material are added (\"Earth Song\" and \"They Don't Care About Us\"), a wash as far as I'm concerned although \"Earth Song\" remains a greatly underappreciated tune. How \"They Don't Care About Us\" ended up on the \"essential\" list, is a head-scratcher (although I like the song).\n\nWould I have bought this again if it wasn't for the ridiculous low price in China? Almost certainly not. But I am glad I did, if nothing else, because it is just another memento from my trip to China (the Chinese version comes with Mandarin characters on the cover). That aside, \"The Essential Michael Jackson\" is a terrific album, whether you buy the US version or the international version, and it really showcases Michael Jackson at his best.","classification":5,"fold":0}

It may have ended up as the \"final\" BOC album in 1988 because of the fact that Joe Bouchard was joined in sessions by Eric Bloom, Allen Lanier, Buck Dharma and Albert Bouchard.\n\nSo WHAT?\n\nIt's got the bone-rattling, truly unique \"The Siege and Investiture of Baron von Frankenstein's Castle At Weisseria,\" featuring Joey Cerisano and Jon Rogers on additional lead vocals and the unforgettable shout\/chant\/refrain \"CARPE DIEM\" followed by doomsday crashing riff-heavy guitars, and the opening track \"I Am the One You Warned Me Of,\" which is easily as good as any of the tracks on the early BOC albums.\n\nThere's also a remake of two songs from the second album (\"Tyranny & Mutation\"), \"Astronomy\" and \"Subhuman\" (which is retitled \"Blue Oyster Cult\" here).\n\nSometimes it pays to focus on what an album IS as opposed to what it ISN'T.\n\nThis one will shake the fillings loose from your teeth.

{"text":"I love music and have a very diverse collection of styles and artists in my cd collection including a lot of artists popular in the UK not known here yet.  For some reason I never discovered Amy Winehouse with her superb first release FRANK.  Had I, I would have been a huge fan from the beginning.  Instead, the same as many, I was introduced to her through the single REHAB which sadly came hand in hand with her strong addiction problems.  The paparazzi had a field day with her.  And the joke was she was singing about rehab when it seemed she so obviously needed it.  Even with her Grammy wins I didn't purchase this album.\n\nRegretfully, it took her very sad and untimely death with talk of her unique musical talents and gifts that I bought both FRANK and BACK TO BLACK.  I have truly fallen in love with Amy.  She indeed was a truly gifted artist.  BACK TO BLACK is honestly one of the best albums I have ever heard.  She wrote every track and by listening to this cd you can put all the gossip and drama aside and listen to Amy as an artist.  It is very important to remember she wrote the lyrics to all these songs and it is obvious the poor woman wore her heart and soul on her sleeve.  But for the listener it provided a great gift.  The cd is a winner from beginning to end and speaks of love and relationships and all that comes with it.  Her style combines retro soul with r&b and jazz with a hint of classic pop.  It is a style new, unique and truly inspired.  The songs BACK TO BLACK, LOVE IS A LOSING GAME and TEARS DRY ON THEIR OWN are instant classics.  ME AND MR. JONES is a stunning and clever album cut.  YOU KNOW I'M NO GOOD is also an instant classic and showns much insight into Amy's thoughts of herself.  Listen to the words on the haunting WAKE UP ALONE and SOME UNHOLY WAR and you will feel so much what the life of this woman was like.\n\nThe song REHAB is not a defiant song to those trying to get her help but rather a declaration of how she thought it wouldn't help.  She talks of what rehab would give her but she could get the same advice and support at home listening to music like Ray Charles and waiting for the sorrow to pass.  In her mind it was all about love and heartbeak.  If the sorrow could pass she would not have to use.  Addiction is a very serious illness and whatever was really going on we need to acknowledge the very sad fact that this musically gifted person Amy Winehouse left us and this life way too early.  For her sake she managed to leave a musical legacy behind with only 2 cds.  She will live on through her music and because of her gifts as a songwriter and expressive, superbly diverse singer we will always see her as the person by the music.  May you rest in peace Amy and hopefully all your demons have been silenced and you have found peace.  But rest assured you will be remembered.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"In country music, one name stands above all others: Willie Nelson.  While not a huge Willie fan, I've always admired the man, for he has such a talent for bringing a song to life.  And \"The Great Divide\" is no exception.\nI won't waste time telling you which songs were my favorites, for you are not me.  I will tell you, however, that you are in for a treat.  Rob Thomas, Sheryl Crow, and Bonnie Rait show themselves for harmony duets, blending their voices well with Willie's.  Lee Ann Womack, Kid Rock, and Brian McKnight go for the full-fledged thing--bringing to life tales of gunslingers, lost loves, and hope.  Willie redoes the old Kenny Rogers rock'n'roll song \"Just Dropped In...\" and goes entirely country on the title track and \"This Face,\" a wonderful ballad about aging.  \"Maria,\" \"Last Stand,\" \"Be There For You,\" and \"Time After Time\" keep the album's upbeat going, while \"Mendocino County Line\", \"Won't Catch Me Crying,\" \"Don't Fade Away,\" \"Recollection Phoenix\", and \"You Remain\" provide a gentler, quieter side.\nWith all the talent on this CD (with Willie, of course, being the most prominent) this is one divide you should not step across.

The song and Whitney's pop elegance stands shoulders above a lot of the pop music of today in droves.

{"text":"I remember the song from my youth as an autistic child in the 1960's.  \"To Sir With Love\" was the title song to a movie of the same name.  The movie chronicled a class of poor to working class family 1960's era inner city tough rebellious high school students.  Sidney Poitier attempting to teach these kids respect for humanity, authority and themselves required the kids to call him sir as a metter of basic respect.  Of course there was lots of struggle and contention as the kids rebelled against the lessons Sir attempted to instill in these children.  Over time Sir won the hearts and souls of the kids and in respect as a gift to him this song was the result.\n\nTo Sir With Love is sung with such passion that it could easily bring me to tears today if I allow it.  Movies about the transformation of wayward people into good people always inspire and move me deeply.  Society had given up on these kids but, Sir saw the potential for greatness in each of them.  Growing up autistic I never knew what to make of teachers, they always seemed to be my enemy.  To Sir With Love at least gave me the ideal the truly great teachers were supposed to be aiming for.\n\nI purchased this To Sir With Love MP3 because; like so many others it marks a key point in my development and understanding of humanity, culture and education.  Being a child with autism the true purpose of school elluded me for a very long time.  To Sir With Love explained the purpose of school by showing the ideal teacher who overcomes all obsticles to insure his students leave high school ready to embrace the world of college or work.","classification":5,"fold":0}

Her music has been more like a fashion of time, but honestly the songs that she has recently shown for her Prism album, have been less than stellar with her previous work. Her latest set of songs have not really had the knock-out punch she had with Teenage Dream. Her latest single, This Is How We Do, the fourth single from her Prism album, feels more like it is a retro throwback to the 80's in music. Sadly, I found the song to not only not deliver, but bring a sag out from Katy's voice. She might be a character to a younger generation, but she needs to find better from her voice than a song that loses her at heart. That is how you shouldn't do.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":0}

{"text":"...of a boring Monday night.\n\nI bought this album on cassette when it came out in 1987.  I'm listening to the CD as I write this review.  It is one of Cher's over-the-top albums, and I say that lovingly.  It's fun, full of catchy tunes, with an overblown production with credits that read like a who's who in studio musicians.  It is perfect listening when you are stuck in a traffic jam, or when you need music to propel you to clean your house.  The high energy songs will help turn washing your windows or dishes into a tightly choreographed routine.  Some reviewers refer to it as a comeback album, but for some of us, Cher never went away.  There might have been a few years absence from the music charts, but does it really matter?","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"After over-playing all my Third Day CDs to date, I was almost worried about whether or not I'd love their new album. I worried that maybe I'd grown tired of their sound. Ha, not even close!!!! This CD, is probably their best new CD yet. A fresher, stronger sound is how I'd describe this collection, with impeccable lyrics, music and vocals. Simply put - awesome. I was shocked to discover that (again, just as with many of their previous CDs), I loved EVERY single song on the CD! I can put it in and listen to every song without even thinking about skipping over a one. That's how good it is. The lyrics and music are PERFECTION - skillfully written and crafted. I can't say enough - get this, the music on this CD is truly a work of art. PTL! :) Also, the songs on this CD display different sounds this time around. My favorites on it are Surrender (very cool intro and southern rock sound!!), Trust in Jesus (awesome classic Third Day), and Sound of Your Voice (beautiful). LOVE LOVE LOVE this CD, and LOVE LOVE LOVE this group! We are so blessed and fortunate to have groups like Third Day to rock out to!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Theres been a lot of debate over Pink Floyd releasing unfinished snippets from their 1994 album The Division Bell as their swan song. Many have said its a disservice to loyal fans, others have claimed its a way of milking music buyers once more before the band finally sails into the sunsetor the endless river.\n\nNearly into their fiftieth year as a band (no matter which lineup era was your favorite), Pink Floyd have nothing left to prove. They have scaled all the heights that most bands could only hope to achieve. Every musician would love to claim to have recorded Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, The Wall, and perhaps even Animals and Meddle. The band members of Pink Floyd could have lived comfortably for the rest of their lives on the royalties from the release of the single Money alone. So I have to disagree when I hear people claiming that the Gilmore-led Pink Floyd are simply cashing in.\n\nThe Endless River is essentially a tribute to the late Rick Wright, Keyboardist for the band and founding member. Wright was a major key element to Pink Floyds sound and success. Often overlooked, Wright provided the band with all the amazing ethereal and sonic sounds throughout their career. One only needs to listen to Dark Side of the Moon to get the gist of his importance. Many pieces of Wrights work were left behind after the completion of the bands 1994 release The Division Bell. Basically, David Gilmore and Nick Mason gathered up the remaining pieces left behind and strung them together to create a final farewell, to both Wright and the fans.\n\nIf you're a fan of the bands instrumentation, then youll really enjoy The Endless River. The album is broken into four pieces (or sides.) The final track, Louder Than Words, is the only song with vocals (Gilmore.)\n\nThe Deluxe version of the album is beautifully housed in a box, including a Casebound book full of photos, Postcards and a Blu-ray Disc featuring the album tracks, bonus tracks and six video clips featuring various stages of recording, from The Division Bell to The Endless River.\n\nA highly enjoyable listening experience and if you love Pink Floyd, theres no reason you wouldnt love this.","classification":4,"fold":0}

Her lead single from the album Body & Soul is absolutely one of those songs that sincerely takes my breath away, from the heart and the beautiful voice within. It still shows a seductive diva singing her heart into song out so well into each and every note. It truly is one of Anita's best songs, and if you really have been stuck on Rapture, you should get a dear listen to this song.

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"After a four year hiatus it's refreshing to have The Decembrists back. They're a group that you can always count on for consistency. They're not out to reinvent themselves in any massive way but over time they've expanded their sound just enough to keep things interesting. What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World doesn't make any major leaps forward but it is pleasant enough for those who have enjoyed their previous outings, yet there's something slightly \"off\" about this one that leaves me a bit underwhelmed.\n\nIn some ways this might be the most meta release the band has ever done. \"The Singer Addresses His Audience\" is a pleasant, if somewhat somber, opener that finds Colin Meloy essentially apologizing for the band changing and exploring new avenues, both musically and commercially. It's a heartfelt nod to their longtime fans but I'm not sure that this was really necessary, as nothing about the group has ever struck me as fake or desperate, but I suppose it's something he felt strongly about. It's not a move I would have expected from Meloy and it seems that the band may be trapped in self-consciousness, afraid to change while also being afraid of continuing with the same style and themes that have come to define them. \"Anti-Summersong\" continues in this vein and finds Meloy caught between wanting to move on and wanting to hang it up. Wrapping the song up in a pleasant sing-a-long melody keeps it from becoming as desperate as the lyrics imply, which is a good thing. Other tracks like \"Cavalry Captain\" and \"Mistral\" are built from the band's typical blueprint but that's not a bad thing by any means. Fans have come to love the band's storytelling and musical boisterousness and these tracks prove they still have it.\n\nI wasn't initially thrilled with lead-single \"Make You Better\" but repeated listens have made me enjoy it more and more. The gentle folk of \"12\/17\/12\" recalls The King Is Dead and \"Better Not Wake the Baby\" wouldn't have sounded out of place on Picaresque. Unfortunately the album also suffers from a slow middle, with tracks like \"Lake Song\", \"Carolina Low\" and \"Till the Water's All Long Gone\" dragging the flow down. In the end the album feels disjointed, as if there are two or three separate projects being condensed into one and the result is a bit messy. Add to that a track like \"Philomena\" (complete with a sexually curious narrator) and it feels tacky coming from a group that's known for literary characters and obscure vocabulary.\n\nIn the end this is an enjoyable album that should please fans of their previous work. It's also a record that feels unfocused and displays a band uncertain of where to go and who to be. Albums like The Crane Wife and The Hazards of Love worked so well because the band appeared fearless and free with what they were doing. Now they seemed trapped in expectations and their own accomplishments, making it hard to tell how many of these tunes are sincere and which ones are being written simply because they feel they have to. I hope Meloy is able to decide what he wants to do and, more importantly, that the band's next effort finds them plowing ahead without the need to apologize for growth. In the meantime there's enough here to tide us over.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"For someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music, its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances, I find this CD one of the most beautiful recordings of all-time. Once again and as always, the great Nelson Riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standards from the Great American Songbook. This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.\n\nWith the superb instrumental skills of pianist Don Grolnick, drummer John Guerin, bassist Bob Magnusson, guitarist Bob Mann (who also played fabulously on Rod Stewart and Steve Tyrell's recordings) and the creative flair of concertmaster David Frisina, this CD offers some of the glowing moments of Ms. Ronstadt's musical career. \"Lush Life,\" \"What's New?\" and \"For Sentimental Reasons\" are three of the greatest and most beautiful albums of standards ever recorded.\n\nNobody sounded more expressive than Ms. Ronstadt singing \"When I Fall In Love,\" a song lamenting that love has ended even before it has begun. You can hear that beguiling guitar accompaniment by a fine guitarist, Bob Mann, complementing Ms. Ronstadt's exquisite voice. Likewise, nobody sounded so excruciatingly poignant with her moving rendition of \"When Your Lover Has Gone.\"\n\n\"What lonely hours\nThe evening shadows bring\nWhat lonely hours\nWith memories lingering\nLike faded flowers\nLife can't mean anything . . .\"\n\nIn \"Skylark,\" the singer made a mark on this song with her heartfelt rendition as she brings new life to this Johnny Mercer\/Hoagy Carmichael classic. She also left a lasting impression to one of Sinatra's signature songs \"I'm A Fool To Want You,\" just like Ol' Blue Eyes did with his meaningful interpretation. They both did the best versions for male and female vocals, respectively.\n\nShe swings lightly on Rodgers & Hart's gem \"You Took Advantage Of Me,\" then she takes it slower in Mills\/Parish\/Ellington's \"Sophisticated Lady.\" And picks up the light swing tempo again on \"Can't We Be Friends?\"\n\n\"Sophisticated lady I know\nYou miss the love you had long ago\nAnd when nobody is nigh\nYou cry. . . you cry.\"\n\nIf you're a lover of standards like me and an admirer of beauty in all its forms, you should have this CD in your collection and take pleasure in listening to its endless beauty.\n\nHere's to the magic of beautiful music!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I want music listeners to know that Bobby Valentino's debut album, \"Disturbing the Peace Presents Bobby Valentino\" is one of the best albums to be released in the last ten years. It is a timeless classic!  \"Fly on the Wall\" is not as good as his debut, but substantially better than \"Special Occassion.\" He is easily one of my favorite artists to come out in recent history. I like the fact that he is talented, educated (Clark-Atlanta alumnus), handsome and a class act.\n\nI heard \"Words\" on AOL Radio and was thrilled to learn that he had another album on the way. I saw him promoting it on Twitter. I am glad I listened to it. It's lengthy, 18 tracks, but who can't appreciate an artist who gives a consumer their money's worth?  Bobby was kind enough to include club tracks, mid-tempos and ballads. He does all he can with his voice, another thing music listeners should appreciate. \"Hummin'\" is a nice track which features a good rap by Lloyd Banks. He remakes Bobby Brown's classic, \"Rock Witcha\" and though this version is nice, Bobby Brown's version trumps Bobby Valentino's. Bobby joins forces with Plies on \"Phone #.\" This song is about getting a girl's number so they can have phone sex. \"Grab Somebody\" is another highlight, it features the king of fast-rapping, Twista. It's a mid-tempo about grabbing someone you are attracted to.\n\n\"Fly on the Wall\" is a good listening experience overall. Some moments are better than others, but it is an enjoyable LP.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"Hummin'\"\n2. \"Words\"\n3. \"Alter Ego\"\n4.\"Rock Witcha\"\n5. \"Sweetness\"","classification":3,"fold":0}

Zac and the band continues to deliver material that put them on the charts, ranging from reggae\/island flavored tunes to twangy country to rock. It's hard to pick out one track over another on this album, or their previous two studio albums for that matter. ZBB defintaly have polished their act over the years with their touring and song writing. If you have the chance to see them live, take it. You'll be singing along with every song, enjoying every moment of their show. They also do a few numbers with their opening act, serving as a back-up band, and help promote their albums which is cool. And they also do several covers of familiar numbers too. It'll be intresting too see them include them on an album one day, just to pay homeage to some of their musical influences.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"As a huge Mahavishnu Orchestra fan, I was pretty excited when I stumbled across this 1975 album, which has been nicely remastered by Columbia.  This album features Jan playing all of the instruments including acoustic piano, Fender Rhodes electric piano, moog synthesizer, Oberheim synthesizer and digital sequencer, Freeman string synthesizer, and mellotron along with a full drum kit.  As it turns out, he is a pretty good drummer.  Steve Kindler provides some violin work here and there, while David Earle Johnson provides percussion on The Animals and Sixth Day People.\n\nThe music on The First Seven Days is a far cry from the full-out rave ups on Mahavishnu albums like Inner Mounting Flame (1971) and Birds of Fire (1973).  Rather, this is a very prog rock sounding album, with loads of synthesizers, European classical influences, rock influences, and with very little in the way of jazz.  In general, the pieces range from quiet piano interludes to heavier tracks that feature the drums (the title track for example).  In general though, all of the tracks are very atmospheric and synth-heavy.\n\nFor those of you that are curious, this album is not an exercise in mere \"blowing\".  Although Jan does flex some Mahavishnu-like muscle from time to time, the pieces are generally carefully composed and arranged, and exhibit a great deal of restraint for somebody with such tremendous \"chops\".\n\nAll in all this album is very highly recommended to prog fans, exploratory Mahavishnu Orchestra fans, and possibly even electronica fans.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Nine Inch Nails has returned, unannounced this time, with a new album.  This one is a 36-track collection of short, instrumental pieces that have no order, no agenda and no direction.  But this is not a bad thing!  It's vintage NIN.  It's abstract art, coming from the mind of one of this era's greatest musicians.\n\nI LOVED how Trent released this album.  I wish I could've gotten the $300 version.  The presentation of this album is nothing short of immaculate.  Even if you only got the mp3 album, the presentation is a cut above your average internet purchase.  Each of the 36 songs has a different picture attached to it.  On my iPod, instead of the album cover, it shows one of these for every song.  It's little things such as this that make Trent's music so invigorating.\n\nObviously it goes without saying that this is not an album for the mainstream.  You can't just pop this in and listen to it like you would any other NIN release.  This one requires a certain degree of active listening for you to pick out the subtle nuances that Trent put into these songs.  As background noise, you won't hear much and no songs really stand out.  This is why the best way to listen to it is through headphones, while allowing your mind to fully take in the music.\n\nThis is one of the most unique releases ever.  Not for everyone, but still a masterpiece.","classification":4,"fold":0}

And what yummy mastering !\nBlast it and you will be taken into another world.\n\nAll of this said, I must admit, the 5'th Dimension were one American Musical Institution that were not so easy to put your finger on... I mean, they pretty much defied the soul of virtually every genre they touched and had a sound that was strictly their own.  Admittedly, at one time I tended to dismiss them as \"bubble-gum\", but then over the years more and more songs from their repertoire began to sneak onto my frequently play list.\nPerhaps it was seeing them do \"PUPPET MAN\" on a repeat of some 70's TV action\/show (?) that initially led me to go after there stuff (as opposed to hearing it on the radio.)  Years later, \"LOVE'S LINES CIRCLES AND LINES\" bought me back again.  (Like most people, \"UP UP AND AWAY\", \"AQUARIUS\" and \"ONE LESS BELL TO ANSWER\" were how I first came to notice them.)\n\nAnyway, combining a groovy look, unique \"lush\" vocal harmony sound (a strange blend of jazz and pop, but backed by WAY extremely kicking orchestrations) - - the FIFTH were a group with a strong visual image and tight sound...  from \"The smiling fat guy with the beard\" to the ultra\/hot\/foxy Marilyn McCoo (yowzums) - - Another interesting thing about the group is that even though they did have Bill Davis, a very traditional SOUL WAILER, it was really the harmonies and Marilyn McCoo's sweet voice, and the overall interaction of the group that made them great.\n\nI could go on and on talking about my favorite tunes from the album, why I like them, and how much I appreciate the mix, but won't...  I'll only say one thing:  This album is a wild incense and peppermint\/Brady Bunch hip trip back to the 70's... and though the music is timeless, it has one other thing in common with the 70's:  If you're old enough to remember it, you may recalling hating it then... but now, really really really loving and missing it...  To me, that's what the Fifth is all about:  A group that grows on you ridiculously...\n\n*P.S.  Baby, send me back in a time machine... I wanna steal Marilyn from Billy!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Hypothethically, if you made an album of The Beatles' best solo songs, it would make sense to gather them from the early years after their infamous split. This paradigm is not new, and its concept was introduced by a columnist whom I cannot recall, so I have to paraphrase it by memory.\n\nAnyway, I would vote for Ringo Starr's \"Photograph,\" arguably the best song of his post Fab Four career.  Contractually, Ringo was given rights to sing one song per Beatles' album, so this one fits the bill.  Can you \"imagine\" (sorry) an album with \"My Sweet Lord,\" \"Nineteen Hundred and Eighty Five,\" \"Imagine,\" \"Love,\" \"My Love,\" \"Listen to What the Man Said,\" \"Give Me Love,\" \"What Is Life?\" \"Whatever Gets You Through the Night,\" and, of course, this one?  If George and Ringo didn't feel like they got the support they desired back in the day, they sure make up for it by (characteristically) supporting each other (George allegedly wrote most of the song) and with a \"little help\" from Ringo's many friends.  Gloriously, \"Photograph\" is as grand and corny as they get.  The rewards are twice that.","classification":5,"fold":0}

Unfortunately (or fortunately) in my junior English class I realized that her beautiful blonde hair was courtesy of Madam Clairol when she went too long between visits to Madam Clairol. But this song has stuck with me forever and I have applied it several women since including the young woman who became my wife who was such a non-Clairol Blonde when we first met that I did not believe she was not a Clairol Blonde for several months.

{"text":"Muse's latest offering \"Drones\" plays out like a summer blockbuster soundtrack. Push play and drift away to a sonic, bombastic landscape of big riffs and meaty drums draped over themes involving western war\/intelligence\/military capabilities. Muse have not put together an album this consistent since Black Holes, or as hard since Absolution. It's a delight to take in for longtime fans. One critique is the lyrical depth. Bellamy's always had awkward lyrics, and here's no exception. The socio-political underpinnings are painfully one dimensional and about as nuanced as a Michael Bay script. But I don't really listen to Muse for the lyrics. I found this album to grow on me quickly, and I look forward to replaying it each time it ends.","classification":4,"fold":0}

I actually like that this album, and their previous one, is strong throughout, without weaker songs added simply to extend the length.  They do write much more \"pop\" songs than other \"indie\" bands, and I expect BoH has much more mainstream appeal because of this, but that's not always a bad thing.","classification":4,"fold":0}

If Volume 1 has a lot of basic repertoire (chamber music-wise), Volume II focuses on works you probably haven't heard.\n\nThere is a really nice variety and a number of welcome rarities.  I'd never encountered Dohnanyi's chamber music before, nor had I heard the Arensky 2nd Quartet or the Clarinet Quintet of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor.  This set also contains excellent performance of the Debussy and Ravel String Quartets and several French pieces for winds.\n\nSo a lot of music (outside of the Debussy and Ravel) that may be unfamiliar but very worthy of your time and 99 cents!","classification":5,"fold":0}

O.N.I.F.C. doesn't possess the same zest of Rolling Papers, suffering from overindulgence and being overstuffed at over 73 minutes.  17 Tracks long, Cuts could and should've been made by Wiz\/producers, isolating the strongest cuts like \"The Bluff,\" \"Work Hard, Play Hard,\" \"Remember You,\" and \"Medicated.\" There are sufficient cuts aside from these, but even promo single \"Work Hard, Play Hard\" is no \"Black and Yellow,\" Stargate producing or not.  Ultimately, O.N.I.F.C. is nothing better than average and never triumphs the likes of stronger 2012 rap albums like Kendrick Lamar's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Good-Kid-M-A-A-D-City-Deluxe-Edition\/dp\/B00913P6G0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Good Kid: M.A.A.D City [Deluxe Edition<\/a>] or even Meek Mill's sometimes flawed but promising&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Dreams-Nightmares\/dp\/B008M4HC66\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dreams & Nightmares<\/a>.\n\nHonestly, the \"Intro\" may be the first bad sign as :40 of instrumental leave the listener ultimately saying to themselves, \"so what?\" \"Paperbound\" saves as the first full length cut, finding Wiz bragging about his excess of money and his substance habits. \"Paperbound\" is at best a 'B,' leaving the listener less intelligent than they felt prior to partaking in \"Paperbound.\" \"Bluffin'\" doesn't atone, with Khalifa bragging on the hook: \"I got so much money I think I should pay for all this\/they ain't down to spend how much they say cause they ain't ballin'...\" Even Christopher \"Drumma Boy\" Gholson's production is less notable than usual on the average cut. The Akon featuring \"Let It Go\" is slightly more notable, but Akon sounds less than enthused on the hook, failing to add much pizzaz. The production is solid nonetheless, giving an ok \"Let It Go\" some redemption.\n\n\"The Bluff,\" featuring Cam'ron is the best cut at the front of the album. ID Labs delivers lush production work of which both Wiz and Cam'ron deliver.  Wiz doesn't change his message, but at least it's more convincing on \"The Bluff.\" Similarly, \"Work Hard, Play Hard\" is none too shabby, even if it falls quite short of the grandeur of \"Black and Yellow.\" \"Work Hard, Play Hard\" benefits from its hook: \"The bigger the bill, the harder you ball\/well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long...work hard play hard,\" etc.\n\n\"Got Everything\" featuring Courtney Noelle marks an upswing, as does the mysterious production on \"Fall Asleep,\" a cut produced by @PopWansel, @Oakwud, and @Flippa123.  Again, it is not messaging as Wiz doesn't change anything, but the music coupled with Wiz's approach at times on this particular cut makes \"Fall Asleep\" worthwhile.  \"Time\" is forgettable, with Wiz referencing his favorite crop while \"It's Nothing\" finds Drumma Boy delivering capable production for a rather dumb song. The hook is as minimalist as Drumma Boy's slinky production: \"It's nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing\/stackin' cheese till my bread right...did it all on my own so I'mma spend all my bread like, it's nothin...\" Pretty simplistic and unintelligible.  2 Chainz certainly doesn't heighten the intellect.\n\n\"Rise Above\" features Pharrell (who also produces), Tuki Carter & Amber Rose.  The production is signature Pharrell, perhaps the best characteristic of the track. Amber Rose's outtro caps off the utter ridiculousness of much of the album and the cut itself.  She manages another spot at the end of \"Initiation,\" a cut that more prominently features Lola Monroe, a female rapper that sounds quite similar to one Nicki Minaj.  Khalifa tells producer Sledgren that \"he's stupid for this one,\" though perhaps Khalifa should have referred to himself. \"This is for them Taylors... Yeah I got it, so I flaunt it\/and I bought it cause I want it,\" he proclaims on the hook.  Maybe Lola Monroe's trash talk serves as the highlight, if there is one here.\n\n\"Up In It\" has lush production (Jim Jonsin, Earl & E, and Rico Love) on its side. \"No Limit\" is well produced but at nine and a half minutes, it is 'way too much.' \"The Plan,\" featuring Juicy J. is more accessible, though still overindulges in that ugly thing called 'repetition.' The two best cuts grace the end, just one of the many qualms that is O.N.I.F.C. \"Remember You,\" featuring The Weeknd is emo and moody just like Abel Tesfaye (The Weeknd) likes it.  Concluding cut \"Medicated,\" featuring Chevy Woods & Juicy J, features superb production by Nate \"Danja\" Hills and solid rhymes by Wiz and the guest artists.  Even if the album starts off incredibly bumpy, Khalifa manages to close it capably.\n\nOverall,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/O-N-I-F-C\/dp\/B008DL466C\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">O.N.I.F.C.<\/a>&nbsp;is just so-so.  It has its good moments, but fails to 'captivate' or truly 'wow.' On future efforts, Wiz will need to focus more and broaden his style, approach, and most important, his rhymes. The lack of truly memorable cuts aside from a few notable ones really hurts this effort. 3 stars is kind.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"I suspect if you are reading this review that you like Leonard Cohen and his type of music since he never has had a hit, and when I ask people if they know who he is I get the typical confused look. Since 1968, Cohen has been writing exceptional poetry and setting them to music. \"Ten New Song\" is his first studio cd since 1992's \"The Future\". In general, Cohen does not push the musical envelope more than he has on previous albums, but he does offer up what I think is a soulful sound. If Cohen can actually be soulful with his one note singing style. Yet, he pulls of the r&b nicely here with songs like \"In My Secret Life\", \"That Don't Make It Junk\", \"Alexandra Leaving\" and \"Boogie Street\". All ten songs are very well written, especially if you compare them to, say, Aerosmith's latest. The kind of music Cohen creates isn't for everyone, but what he makes he makes well. A good solid album, \"Ten New Songs\" should last us another 10 years until his next album!!","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"The first time you heard \"While You See a Chance\" in the early 80's you hear these luscious arranged keyboard sounds, and it welcomes the 80's decade with a up tempo keyboard solo, then you hear the voice and you say to yourself \"Isn't that Steve Winwood? The same guy who played organ in the Spencer Davis Group?\"  You automatically get a road map of Winwood's new 80's direction.  It's a direction of synthesizers dominating his sounds, and soloing with unique keyboard phrases that defines this era of his career.  Arc Of A Diver is the beginning of  Winwood where he redefines himself.  The album's mix is below par.  The instrumentations that are put together also fail to adhered some kinda of unity, but this is excused because Steve Winwood played all the instruments.  Winwood also engineered and mixed the whole album.  In my opinion when it comes to artists that play all their instruments on their albums I put Arc Of A Diver in the top 5.  Their are some good uptempo danceable songs like \"Second Hand Women\", and \"Night Train.\"  \"Slowdown Sundown\" is more classic Winwood ballad.  You can hear the organ, but their is also a beautiful multimoog solo.  Their are only seven tracks on this album, and a important album in Steve Winwoods career.  The album is only 40 minutes long, but enjoyable!","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Jackson Browne's \"Standing in the Breach\" is a strong addition to an amazing catalog.  The set opens with \"The Birds of St. Marks\" that Val McCallum's chiming lead guitar brings to mind the classic Southern California sound from the Byrds' era with Browne's amazing lyrics, \"Maybe we've found what we have lost when we've unwound so many crossed, entangling misunderstandings.\"  \"Yeah Yeah\" is a track that grabs me with its catchy melody, Browne's great singing, \"You paid for the love that we've got, you paid.  And you made for the heart when we fought and you stayed.\"  \"The Long Way Around\" is a midtempo gem with its deceptively simple melody and a sweet supporting vocal by Chavonne Stewart, \"Now I'm a long way gone from this wild road I'm on.\"  On \"You Know the Night\" Jackson takes a lyric by Woody Guthrie and adds his classic Browne melody which makes the track fit seamlessly into this set.  Browne translates Cuban singer Carlos Varela's lyric and sings his melody passionately with Varela contributing end vocals on \"Walls & Doors,\" \"For some, it's always winter while others have the spring; Some people find good fortune while others never find a thing.\"  The title track is a philosophic anthem with a lovely sadness in the melody between the vision of a better world and the reality of what we've made of it in the present, \"You don't know how it will happen now after all that's come undone, but you know the change the world needs now is there, in everyone.\"  \"Standing in the Breach\" is a strong set.  It doesn't have quite the catchy pop hooks of the early classic recordings, but it adds depth and insight which feels like sonic wisdom.  Enjoy!","classification":4,"fold":0}
{"text":"Ryan Leslie is a musical genius and one of this generation's shining stars.  He and The-Dream stand side by side as phenomenal producers\/songwriters\/performers.  Ryan Leslie has such a unique production style that is unmistakable yet distinct, addictive, and musical.  He presents sample free instrumentation and creativity, sufficient singing (face it he isn't exactly Luther Vandross), and excellent thought provoking heartfelt lyrics on his second studio album Transition.\n\nRyan Leslie makes music that everyone can enjoy and it is one of this world's great mysteries why he isn't a megastar.  Without sounding like a crazy person(STAN) everything he touches is great\/noteworthy.  He can switch between his futuristic R&B landscape to hip hop tracks and down to ballads.  He can do it all...a true triple threat in music.  The only song I don't like is \"NOTHING\". All music lovers should definitely purchase this album because it's definitely worth every penny.\n\n*If you bought from BB, you get three bonus tracks WHEN WE DANCE, PROMISE NOT TO CALL, and RESCUE U.  Those are just some more Ryan Leslie goodness especially RESCUE U.  A DVD accompanies it and although I haven't had a chance to watch it, it features ZODIAC video, some behind the scenes and making of footage and soundchecks.  The lyrics are included in the book as well.  That along with the music is good incentive for a purchase*","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Chris Botti has been one of the most sought after jazz musicians over the last decade.  His CD's have been very diverse within the Contemporary Jazz spectrum, often rolling between Acid Jazz and R&B.  But in his latest CD, Botti goes back to jazz standards from the 1950's & 60's.  Botti does give a nice rendition of Sade's \"No Ordinary Love\".  Other highlights were \"When I Fall In Love\" & \"Someone To Watch Over Me\".  It's quite refreshing to hear music done with such a melodramatic touch.  If you're looking for music in the line of \"Indian Summer\" or \"Regrooveable\", look elsewhere.  But, if you want music you can relax to or have a nice dinner with, this CD is for you!  Recommended!!","classification":4,"fold":0}

Neither album has enough originality, energy or even catchy hooks to get played very often. (Plus, the Decemberists seem to rely on  'profound' &\/or 'shock value' lyrics in all too many songs) The albums aren't bad; they are just not all that good.\n\nIt's sad, too, because both artists have produced excellent music in the past. In The Decemberists' case, \"The Crane Wife\" & \"The King Is Dead\" were very good, albeit with the yawner \"Hazards Of Love\" sandwiched between them.\n\nIf you find that you can't really get into \"What a Terrible...\" or \"Down Where...\" as much as you'd hoped, you might consider checking out Armistice or The Pierces (\"Creation\", etc.). And recent productions by Dan Auerbach [Ray LaMontagne, Black Keys, even Nikki Lane ] have ranged from very good to outstanding.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Right up until last year, I was never really much of a Metallica fan.  Then for some reason, I decided to get Garage Inc..  That in turn was followed by Justice, Black, Load, Reload, S&M, Puppets, and now, Ride.  Before buying S&M, I deciding to get the Cunning Stunts DVD.  And  believe me, I really enjoyed the spectacular concert the guys performed,  particularly, \"Creeping Death\" (probably the best song on the  DVD), \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\", and especially \"Kill\/Ride  Medley\".  Those performances (along with the tracks on S&M) were  what prompted me to buy this CD. I was especially interested in hearing the  original versions of \"Fight Fire With Fire\" and \"Ride The  Lightning\" from the Medley.  And let me tell you, they are definitely  killer!  The machine-gun guitar and drum riffs were probably what made this  CD popular in the first place.  IMHO, Metallica help create speed\/thrash  metal in the early\/mid-80's.  Not only do you get the killer riffs, but you  also get the popular \"Fade To Black\" which is similar to  \"One\" in that it starts out really slow, then gradually picks up  speed before peaking at a fast guitar solo.  And then you have \"The  Call Of Ktulu\" which is an excellent instrumental by itself (however,  I prefer the S&M version; it sounds SO much better with the  orchestra!).\nBeing a new Metallica fan, so to speak, I can start to see  why many of the longtime fans out there don't prefer the newer stuff  they've put out (I personally like both of the Loads).  Ride (along with  Puppets and Justice) was unique in the sense that Jaymz and company had the  guts to put out something that would stand the test of time to this day.  Even though I've heard it only a few times, I'm starting to appreciate it  already!","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"While I love the movie \"Real Steel,\" the soundtrack didn't especially stand out to me... except for this song.  It debuted in most of the scenes with Atom's introduction to the ring, and the sight of the robot and his young owner\/trainer entering the arena with a fun dance number were cute and added some levity to the film.  And while it isn't the type of music I normally listen to, those scenes left enough of an impression on me -- and the song got embedded deeply enough in my head -- that I decided to track down a copy.\n\n\"Give It a Go\" is a heavy techno beat with heavily synthesized voices, almost like something Daft Punk might produce (only not as heavy on the synthesizer in the instrumentals).  It's unexpectedly fun and catchy, though, and one can't help but move along with the beat.  The singing isn't stellar and the female vocal seems to come out of nowhere, but otherwise it's a good number and could work well as a club or workout song.\n\nNot great, but a decent song from a good movie, and guaranteed to get the blood pumping.  As mentioned before, a good song to have playing in your headphones while you do your workout.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Despite the title, this song is actually a pleasure to listen to.  I must first start off by saying how much I love the fact that that Three Days Grace manages to turn a song about love involving pain into a genius art form.  This is another fun song that I have on my zune player and I like how he expresses himself when he sings lyric such as \"trust me and take my hand\" \"when the lights go out you will understand\" and then the song pauses for s split second before he belts out pain among the right timed guitars to help break the pause.  He raises his voice some times during the songs but he does it at the right times in the songs such as in the end of it and at one of my favorite moments in the song when he sings \"I'm always here for you\" \"Iknow, I know, I know, I know that you'll thank me later\".  The lead singer's awesome voice goes perfect with this song. Anyhow, the interesting thing about this song is that if you would like to listen to a sensual erotic song that falls under the hard rock\/alternative rock genre then this song would be a must have in your musical collection.  It's been a couple of years since this song came out but I am still enjoying it and I am glad to have it as part of my musical collection.  This song is definitely recommended for rock music lovers amd even music lovers that may only be lightly into rock but would like to add something different to their musical collection.","classification":5,"fold":0}

The haunting \"Willing & Able\" takes the tempo down and features soul crooner Kwabs on something that wouldn't sound out of place on his album. A sultry Lorde appears on the moody soulful \"Magnets\". \"Let's embrace the point of no return\" she pleads.\n\nEverything stands out really, from the dark clubby \"Jaded\", the spare hypnotic \"Good Intentions\" featuring Miguel, the woozy \"Superego\" featuring London songstress Nao, the skittery bounce of \"Echoes\", the slow burning D'Angelo-style \"Masterpiece\" featuring the soulful Jordan Rakei, the late night groove \"Molecules\", the trippy ballad \"Moving Mountains\", and the hushed pulsing Jamie XX-style \"Afterthought\" which is anything but.\n\nAnother winner!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"If there is one thing that I have always loved about Phil Collins, is that when it has came down to his solo songs, they have been very strong, upbeat and sincere from the soul. But after his first two records which were more dormid and dark reflecting on divorce, Face Value & Hello I Must Be Going, he needed to have something more poppy and upbeat in his career. Than his landmark 1985 album, No Jacket Required came along, and earned Phil a lot of great acclaim and rewards, including Album Of The Year a the 1986 Grammy Awards. Now, looking back at Phil's legacy, I have always loved his brilliance in song, but also the choices he has made in song have been very strong. Even when he took a notorious use of Prince's music for Sussudio. The lead single from No Jacket Required, which took on a sample of Prince's 1999, actually is one of those uplifting songs that have been strong from the soul, and definitely upbeat in the rhythm at heart. It is a great song worth listening too, and one of those tracks that really was a game changer for Phil in the 80's that is still fun to listen to. If you've never heard a Phil Collins song before, well this is one I absolutely recommend.\n\nSong: A-","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"\"Yeah, well... there's the ultimate `production record,'\" was my first thought, upon first hearing this. (A \"production record,\" of course, is anything built ENTIRELY behind the board.) ANYBODY could have sung the vox, in other words... ANYBODY could have built the drum-track on any old laptop, ANYBODY could have built the bass line with a phlanger add-in to Reason -- and ANYBODY could have the mixed the whole thing with PT on any old PC in anybody's basement.\n\nThe truth is, however, that the track NOT a by-the-numbers piece from RedOne's assembly line - and that's a very cool thing indeed: it is, instead, a self-crafted little gem from a duo straight out of nowhere, Colorado. Yeah, it SOUNDS (initially) like a crunk-core version of any other production record; it has every hallmark of every other major-label McCookie McCutter record-of-the-moment (which will be history the very moment that THIS PARTICULAR SPLIT-SECOND passes the world by) - BUT THIS ONE HAS SOMETHING ELSE: this one has THAT EXACT AND SPECIFIC something else; that special, intoxicating, can't-quite-put-your-finger-on-it THANG that hits just the right mix of jarring yet cool and yet utterly NEW genre-mashing... that THANG which leads to monster hit records -- which, ultimately, turn-out to be so massive that they lead to the direct creation of entirely new sub-genres within modern pop.\n\nIt's THAT damn huge.\n\nBLACKOUT is simply ALL KINDS of massive.\n\nBreathe Carolina mix electronica with post-hardcore; they mix autotune with vocorder while screaming vox into the red. In other words, they break EVERY rule. \"Um, yeah... guys, that's not supposed to work.\" It DOES, though: it works PERFECTLY. And that's the crux: they mix clean with unclean vocals AND EFFECTS; they mix all of those exact and specific things which AIN'T SUPPOSED TO WORK AT MASS MARKET ON THE BIG CHART AT ALL. They take EVERY musical risk, is what I'm trying to say; they take EVERY wrong turn and almost dare the song to fall apart, and, oh man... is it EVAR cool. I mean, it's just hella HELLA cool... it's just all kinds of goddang awesome. In other words, what they have here is something that every label on Earth is constantly searching for, and yet so rarely find: A sound that is blazingly unique, blindingly frigging original, and ooooohhh-sooooo-insanely-commercial. You can almost SMELL the platinum.\n\nBlackout is a MONSTER. As I write this, the song has yet to chart, anywhere. I heard the track on middle-of-the-night Minnesota radio, and I could hardly imagine the jing this thing will pull, like a magnet, from iTunes. It IS, simply, the record of the year. I can't even count the possible ringtones in this thing; there's gotta be at least a hundred Million worth of ringtone$ in Blackout. It's the edgiest thing to hit the big chart (WHEN it hits, that is) in a good long while... the style is BRAZEN; the record is a textbook on FLAIR. It's just gripping, man... the band rips through its chorii like Bon Jovi on steroids. It's anthemic, and you just can't turn it off. Even after it ends, you find yourself turning-off the radio just to re-listen, in your head, to what you've just heard.\n\nIt's the Bay City Rollers doing Linkin Park covers -- as if they were produced by RedOne and mixed by Bob Rock.\n\nAbsolutely MASSIVE.\n\nGood God, just MASSIVE.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"After 8 years, Modest Mouse is finally back, and this album should not disappoint you, as long as you give it a fair chance. Lets start by stating the obvious: this is not Lonesome Crowded West. Nor is it The Moon and Antarctica. However, its still a solid body of work with some standout Modest Mouse tracks.\n\nThe album starts off strong, building from the slow Strangers to Ourselves into the driving Lampshades On Fire and Sh*t in Your Cut, all three of which are very good songs. Then, we have the unfortunate thing that is track 4: on first listen, Pistol might seem like one of the worst songs ever. However, it grows on you, reminiscent of My Morning Jackets Highly Suspicious, a song that seems so bad until you realize its actually embarrassingly good (but still in a bad way).\n\nIt doesnt take long for the band to recover. Track 6, The Ground Walks, with Time in a Box, is an instant classic, the type of energetic, fist-pumping, foot-pounding song that makes Modest Mouse so great.\n\nFrom there, the album remains pretty solid until the complete throwaway track God is an Indian Why they decided to include this on the album is beyond me. After 8 years, I guess anything goes. But a lousy 1-minute track isn't enough to ruin a good album.\n\nOverall, theres plenty of good stuff on this record. Yes, it feels a little bloated at times, and its by no means their best. Some of these riffs feel recycled, and it doesnt cover much new territory. But this is still one mighty mouse that packs a lot of punch.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"I am a big fan of Leonard Cohen, but I don't care for his earlier albums.  Not being a fan of any folk music, regardless of lyrics, I have always preferred other ways for singer\/songwriters to compose.  Of course, that's my personal preference, and in no way do I want to denigrate this great man's earlier works either - it just isn't my cup of tea, and I'm not a fan of most live music either unless it does something different and exciting.\n  \"Ten New Songs\" is past Cohen's pure folk style where he started employing different elements, like synthesizers on \"I'm Your Man\" or bluesy like \"Popular People\".  The main difference for me is his voice.  As he grew older, his vocal performance took on an almost mystical quality - so deep, some half spoken, especially on \"Dear Heather\" or his last few albums, including the beautiful and my favorite album of his, \"You Want It Darker\", one of the saddest yet brilliant and catchy albums ever.\n  \"Ten New Songs\" came after a nine year break, and according to amazon's review, he spent most of it in a monastery studying Zen teachings.  I'm not sure just how effective that isolation may have been but this album is the most languid and smooth of his latter works, and that's saying something coming from a man like him who defined mellow and cool in his music.  Sharon Robinson was a big part of this album, and played the lion's share of instruments and provided her own backing vocals.  She also wrote a lot of the music, with Cohen of course providing his usual genius lyrics and smoky voice.\n  This album like no other Cohen CD is truly a captivating one as the style stays consistent with some of the most pensive and ethereal material he's done.  For those who are most attracted by his lyrics, they are included, but \"Ten New Songs\" are truly a set of tunes that fit together like a puzzle, with no pieces to be spared.  It isn't quirky, like \"Popular Problems\", a bit weird (but still great) like \"Dear Heather\", or synth heavy like \"I'm Your Man\".  It's another essential album from a genius who is and will continue to be a sorely missed presence in a music scene that desperately is crying out for the kind of quality he possessed.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Recently I decided to download this song on my zune player after being captivated by the sound and savoring it.  It turns out that the vocals are sung by Trace Cyrus (Miley Cyrus's older brother).  Although Trace is only 19 years old he really sings this song in a very self confident and mature way.  Admittedly this is a song that you may not want to expose to somebody that is under 13 because the song has sexual undertones to it.  The reason why I say this is because the song still has appropriate language to it but he sings about being on the bed with someone and their clothes on the floor (to his credit creatively).  He also suggests in the song how he will take someone home if he's not left at the front door.  However what makes the song great is that he sings the song creatively, self confidently, and narratively.  The reason why is say that he sings this narratively is because it sounds like he is telling a short story about charming someone he is interested in while making sure to combine the singing in seamlessly.  I agree with the others that say this is a good workout song too because the music is really  upbeat and sounds like something you can easily dance to in the club or a party.  It was also featured on one of the reality tv shows I was watching on mtv one night that features Lauren Conrad.  All in all if you are fine with songs that have a dance pop twist and you are curious to listen to how Trace Cyrus sounds then in my opinion you will like this song.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"RICKY VAN SHELTON-16 BIGGEST HITS: He may have typified the \"hunks in hats\" era of late eighties\/early nineties country, but RICKY VAN SHELTON had a lot more going for him than a dazzling smile and a twinkle in his eye...an honest to goodness, authentically expressive set of pipes that served him well on a hit batch of sprightly honky tonkers and bittersweet ballads. Like his non-songwriting contemporary GEORGE STRAIT, RVS made the most of material from outside contributors, from legendary tunesmiths ROGER MILLER to HARLAN HOWARD. Whether tackling well loved oldies such as NED MILLER's FROM A JACK TO A KING and JACK GREENE's STATUE OF A FOOL or kicking up his heels for modern day barn burners WILD MAN and CRIME OF PASSION, his passionate Virginia-bred baritone and spirited delivery was always front and center. VAN SHELTON racked up nine chart-topping singles and many more top tens during his hey-day, most of which are collected on 16 BIGGEST HITS, an indispensable offering for fans of \"in the pocket\" new traditionalist country.\n\nRATING: FOUR STETSONS","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Balligomingo is the brainchild of keyboardist\/programmer Garrett Schwarz, and I first became aware of the group through the inclusion of their song, \"Purify,\" on the \"Pure Moods IV\" CD, and I was instantly taken with the song's lushness & sensuality, so I bought the group's album, \"Beneath The Surface.\" This is an excellent disc, filled with heavenly keyboards, beats, atmospheres, and female vocals that remind me of groups like Enigma and Delerium. If you love the ethereal music of those studio groups, you will most certainly love Balligomingo. The dreamiest tracks, in my opinion, are \"Purify,\" \"Sweet Allure,\" \"Wild Butterfly\" (with an obvious nod to Enigma in it---listen for it), \"Beyond,\" \"Marooned,\" \"Lust,\" and the untitled bonus track. Great music to chill to, with lovely, seductive vocals throughout by such ladies as Jody Quine, Beverley Staunton & Jennifer Hershman. \"Beneath The Surface\" is a great debut album by this promising studio outfit, and I definitely want to hear more.

{"text":"This is still one of my favourite George Benson CDs. He won a 'Record of the Year' Grammy in 1976 for \"This Masquerade\" and rightly so. It's a fantastic vocal performance and the only vocal performance on this record.\n\nHe also won a 'Best Pop Instrumental Performance' Grammy that same year for \"Breezin'\" and this was the song I remember being all over the radio back then. But the guitar work on that particular song is nothing compared to what he throws down on the excellent (and proper jazz) songs, \"Affirmation\" and \"So This Is Love?\"\n\nBut those two are just my favourites. All six tunes are great and this is another of those CDs I put on repeat anytime I play it. One listen is very rarely ever enough. Great production by the celebrated Tommy LiPuma with the orchestra arranged and conducted by the equally legendary Claus Ogerman. It rarely gets any better.\n\nIf war or flooding (or something equally disastrous) was on its way and I had the opportunity to take 100 CDs from my collection before I fled, this would definitely be one of them.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"As far back as I remember, my daughter has been a huge fan of Audrey Hepburn. The movie, \"Breakfast At Tiffany's\", was her all time favorite. Little did I know that the song, \"Moon River\" was the song she had always dreamed of playing as she walked down the aisle at her wedding. This past February, my \"little girl\" got married, but that's not all of the story.\nSee, not only am I her father, I am also a pastor. Not only did I have the great privilege of walking my baby girl down the aisle but I was also given the privilege of presiding over the wedding ceremony.\nAs the song \"Moon River\" began to play, I looked at her and she at me, smiles on both our faces as well as tears beginning to flow from both our eyes, I could still see that same \"little girl\" who was now a grown woman who had made her daddy so proud for so many years. We began that long walk down the aisle with the eyes of many watching us, most filled with tears, just like us. When we finally reached the altar and my close friend and fellow pastor asked the question, \"Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?\", I once again looked at her, now seeing the beautiful woman she has become, and uttered the words, \"I do.\" Then, taking my place in the pulpit, I saw her and my now son-in-law looking at one another with a love so intent.\nI have listened to this song so many times since that day and hear it afresh each time, praying that not only did this little song fulfill my \"little girl's dream\" but that all of her dreams with her husband and my grandchildren will always be fulfilled. Thank you Ms. Hepburn, for recording a song that made a dream come true.","classification":5,"fold":0}

In general, Shambhu's guitar solo is weightless and deeply meditative. It is free from pain and suffering. His music inspires you to open your heart and to hear the vibrations of love and compassion. It gives a rest for your soul and helps to achieve clearness for your mind.\n\n\"Sacred Love\" is the debut album by Shambhu. It was produced by legendary Windham Hill Records founder and Grammy winner Will Ackerman. Many first class musicians have participated on the recording of this release. As a result \"Sacred Love\" is a multicolored carpet which imbues with the aromas of various cultures and musical traditions.\n\nThe debut album by Shambhu has the unique, mesmeric flavor of the music of India. And at the same time it is a really western born project. Cello, violin and other parts of traditional instruments bring tenderness and a classical charm to \"Sacred Love\".\n\nOne wants to listen to these fine tunes very attentively in order to not to miss each nuance. Shambhu's music is penetrated by many subtle details and when you listen to the composition \"Imagine\" you, without effort, are able to recognize the thoughtful and slightly ringing guitar of Will Ackerman. His touching soul manner of performing cannot be confused with anybody else.\n\nIn conclusion I'd like to say that \"Sacred Love\" has a perfect sound design. Its sounding is pure and exquisite. When I listened to the album of Shambhu one thought appeared in my mind again and again: how could I live without this wonderful music all the time before?\n\nSerge Kozlovsky\n[...]","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"1978 was a year that found the dead at the beginning of a major transition . all organic entities are in a constant state of evolving and the dead were no different. the sound the dead developed and the set lists are easily identified and 78 has it's uniqueness just as other periods do. the emergence of scarlet\/fire as the center piece of a dead show along with terrapin station as a focal point is a trademark of this point in time. these songs are played superbly here at this show and the terrapin\/rhythm devils\/ space\/ nfa\/ black peter, sequence here is excellent, with wild drums and way outer space.. it showcases how mickey's drumming was such a dominant musical force by this time ;; which also leads to the decline of keith's influence on the sound of the band. the transition i alluded to earlier was this fact and also the eventual exit from the band by keith and donna. depending on which era you were seeing the band for yourself, generally will influence your view on weather this was a positive or a negative change. regardless of were your preferences lie, you cannot deny the changes in the sound of the band here from just a few years earlier. this cd is a great snapshot of what was going down in mid 78 with very good versions of each song performed ,, the mixing and sound is the usual top shelf product thanks to dave and co. there are some cool and unique surprises in this show [ disco dead and a surprise zevon tune as well as a surprisingly high energy first disc along with more]which will make this cd a great addition to your collection. this cd sold out quickly over at the dead site ,, hope you got one ! to my humble ears  it's the best 'official' release from 78 since dicks picks 18,, although i had been wishing for some 'hidden' tracks to fill disc, 2 ... that didn't happen .. as they stayed with the complete show concept..","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"There honestly sometimes are artist who might have potential, but others who just haven't made any good songs ata all. For Katy Perry, whom last year was really a bit overdubbed as the I Kissed A Girl vixen, has yet to really make the soul shine as her own. For her latest single, Thinking Of You, the third single from her debut album One Of The Boys, shows that she is trying to grow up quickly from being a wannabe artist, to a rock diva. Sadly, I didn't feel the chemistry here either matched for her either. She might have the appeal, but for Katy Perry herself, she needs to find much better songs to think of. Thinking Of You just wasn't at all a thought in the dark.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":0}

{"text":"This is the first LP record (album) from the Pretty Reckless and was released in 2011. \"The Pretty Reckless\" are a New York rock band fronted by Taylor Momsen.\nThe Pretty Reckless now have 3 albums and I listened to the 2nd one first. I don't recall hearing any singles form \"Light Me Up\" but who doesn't remember \"Follow Me Down\" and :Heaven Knows\".\nAs a 1st album this is really pretty good. Musically this isn't very experimental or pregressive. It's a standard rock set. What makes this special then is Taylor Momsen's voice and the lyrics. The lyrics tell a dark tale of drugs, alcohol, sex and sexual abuse. So even though the music is modern-rock conservative it will build an audience. So as the audience builder album it works well and act as a gateway to the more populist \"Going to Hell\". The two best songs are \"The Walls are closing in\/hangman\" and \"Mad love\". Two great bookends for an interesting debut album>","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I was fortunate to receive an advanced copy of Fly from Here the new album by Yes, and it is a masterpiece! The album itself has a timeless quality about it, and is a pleasure to listen to.\nTrevor Horn ex-lead singer for Yes is once again with the band as strictly a producer\/cowriter, and the product is brilliant.\nNote: (Trevor Horn replaced Jon Anderson as lead vocalists in the band for the Drama album exclusively, as well as the tour in support of the album).\n This release also marks the debut of Benot David the new lead singer for Yes, and I have to say I am extremely impressed with his vocals. David appears to sometimes sound a bit like Anderson, but more like Horn, so much so that at times one might think they were listening to something from Drama that was never released. That in fact is not far from the truth, as the title track \"Fly from Here\" an epic six part piece is based on a demo from 1980 entitled \"We Can Fly from Here\". Having expanded the demo track into the epic it now is was a fantastic idea, and it works mainly due to Benot David's vocal similarity to Trevor Horn. The other five tracks are primarily stand-alone tunes and are beautifully written and performed by the band as a whole. Rejoining Yes for Fly from Here is yet another member of the band from the Drama album, on keyboards completely outdoing himself is Geoff Downes, and Geoff is at the top of his game, and is refreshing to hear performing at his progressive rock peak. Longtime Yes members Chris Squire , Alan White, and Steve Howe are also in rare form, especially throughout the six part \"Fly from Here\".\nThis album signifies a new beginning for Yes, and brings us some closure from the days of Drama (one of my favorite albums), as well as opening the future for the band building on the Drama sound and taking it to an entirely new level. Fly from Here in many ways is the follow-up to Drama ,that we as Yes fans never got, and although many fans may refuse to accept any other singer then Jon Anderson, get over it! Change can be a good thing, and in the case of Fly from Here an exceptional musical experience!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"\"One Step Up\" is an open look at the troubled marriage Mr. Springsteen had with Julianne Phillips at the time.  The song depicts the singer in a hopeless marriage that he and wife keep living the same old sad story and act.  They keep fighting and having little battles in their dirty war.  This drives the singer to a bar where he contemplates sleeping with another woman.  He sees that she isn't married and he knows he's just pretending to be.  After he's seen his potential one-night stand he remembers that he dreamt the night before that he danced with his wife to never ending music.  He can't escape the marriage as whenever he tries to move forward, he gets dragged back into the hopeless situation.","classification":5,"fold":0}

I honestly found the music video very eccentric (in a positive way), but creative at the same time, and hearing the song got me interested in hearing it more.  I admit that this review is also influenced by the fact that I think that he is very hot in the video. The song contains many good industrial rock notes in it, and I like the words to the chorus when he nearly seductively whispers towards the middle of the song (there is a cool chorus part where he says the following lyrics that I find very sexy and creative:( Through every forest, above the trees Within my stomach, scraped off my knees I drink the honey inside your hive You are the reason I stay alive). Obviously, many who read this review already know exactly what that part of the chorus means. I was only listing one part of the various great parts of the song that I found very exciting.

He was best known for his 1967 hit single and generational anthem, `San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)'...John Phillips wrote and co-produced \"San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Flowers In Your Hair)\" for McKenzie. Phillips played guitar on the recording and session musician Gary L Coleman played orchestra bells and chimes. The bass line of the song was supplied by session musician Joe Osborn. Hal Blaine played drums.\"\n\n\"'San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)' was released on 13 May 1967 in the United States and was an instant hit, reaching #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was also a #1 in the UK and several other countries, selling over seven million copies globally.\"\n\nAnd what a great song this is! True, the others did a great job helping Scott with this number; but I'm particularly impressed with Scott McKenzie's unforgettable treatment of this song. Scott sings with great sensitivity and captures the musical essence of \"The Summer of Love\" flawlessly.\n\nSadly, Scott McKenzie passed away just 3 days ago; he will be remembered for quite some while to come. This song is the perfect introduction to Scott's artistry; we are better off because he shared his gift with us.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"This album came out during my junior year in college. Van Morrison was at his peak. The performances, rightly regarded as classic, were well regarded, but the recorded sound and production on the original vinyl album was not. While the \"Caledonia Soul Orchestra\" was a great unit, their sound was not well captured. This new remastered release belatedly corrects that situation.\n\nWhile I still miss the full sound of David Hayes' bass, it is far more prominent than before. More importantly perhaps, Van is right up front. Another reviewer suggested that if you turn it up, you'll feel as if you are right at the show - and that is true, particularly with a fine sound system. Just be prepared to turn the bass up a bit more than usual.\n\nThese two discs capture Van The Man at his creative, musical, and performing peak. Not an easy thing to do - in 1973, 2003, or even 2013. Van and the band really s-w-i-n-g on these tunes - this is not merely a run through of the standards\/hits from his big early 70s albums. Everyone's clearly having fun. Even Morrison himself. Everything sounds fresh and newly written. If These Dream Of You doesn't get you up and rockin' around your living room I don't know what will. Celtic soul indeed. Help Me.\n\nHow good is this set?

{"text":"Electro-pop singer Ashley Nicolette Frangipane was born in Washington, New Jersey to a Black father and a White mother. The contrast in tastes of music (Her father: Hip hop, her mother; Alternative rock) would form the basis of who she is as an artist. Coming from humble beginnings, the singer watched as her parents struggled to make ends meet, as they were minors at the time of her birth. As a teenager, she became well versed in playing the violin as well as the acoustic guitar. However, she became a musician full time to make ends meet. She then chose the moniker Halsey, which was an alternate spelling of her first name and filmed doing cover songs on YouTube and posting original songs on Soundcloud. The latter gave her attention from record labels, to which she signed to the Virgin Records' alternative label Astralwerks Records - the same label responsible for The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim and Empire Of The Sun. In 2014, she released her EP \"Room 93\" and went on tour with the British band The Kooks as an opening act. Almost a year after she released her EP, she released her debut album \"Badlands\" which featured production from the likes of Tim Anderson, Lido, The Futuristics, Swedish producer Yung Gud and the trio Captain Cuts, among others.\n\nMusically, her album is rooted in the current sounds of edgy pop music with frequent nods to 80's indie. Thematically, the concept revolves around a fictional dystopian society called The Badlands - a desert wasteland where the survivors and natives were imprisoned. She begins the project with \"Castle\", where she enters a progressing society despite being chained. Halsey also tries to keep her head up admist the face of adversity and opposition on \"Hold Me Down\". On the first single \"New Americana\", she celebrates the diversity of the millennial generation, while working in a reference to Mtume's 1983 hit \"Juicy Fruit\". On the ballad \"Drive\", she speaks of a couple who have deep feelings for each other but are very careful not to make the first move and respond with silence. \"Hurricane\" is an autobiographical song that tells of her brief romance with an older man in her native New York during her teenage years. She finds an escape from her problems and desires to find happiness somewhere else on \"Roman Holiday\", while being done with an indifferent lover on \"Ghost\". She deals with someone on a path to self-destruction on \"Colors\" and continues the storyline on \"Coming Down\". Overall, \"Badlands\" is a good recording from Halsey. Although the production could have been a little better, in the end the songs are quite catchy and surprisingly upbeat for an indie pop act. Given the success of her debut, there may be a chance to hear more from her.","classification":4,"fold":0}

It's just good music.\n\nIt's true country music. Not the junk you find on modern country radio. Lemon Drop (Track 2)  sounds like it was written in 1962, and that's not a bad thing.

{"text":"Never before have I started a review with the words the End is the beginning, but as Fiona started her album as such, I thought I would as well.\n\nTrack one from her brand new album is a treat, it's the title of the album and 600 years in a moment is probably the ground breaking new release she dreamed of, this amazingly talented Australian artist just oozes class beyond the pale realms of the legions of the New Age Piano genre.\n\nHer sultry voice leads us so gently into an album of majesty and grace, but a talent so rare and a track so crafted as the opener at some six minutes plus long is not only courageous but stunning.\n\nNaked Love, track two is also an emotive and clever journey of mixed genres, a musical chef would throw in a little Jazz, mixed with some world influences, even a little gypsy feel now and then and with the constant piano of Fiona's which I must add is played to total perfection is a recipe for greatness.\n\nThe Journey, again this composition is a marvel, rarely to I rave about an album while in the writing process, but I find myself scribing away about this release with an eager heartfelt willingness to let you my dear constant readers just how good this album is and I am only 3 tracks in.\n\nThis is an upbeat, yet mellow and with the negative chords adds a little emotional feeling that lays like a dream of a distant far off love that is eager to be reached, there is everything to be adored about this track, the strings alone are a constant driving force, the bass reverberates around the musical heart, the drumming is like a constant pounding of musical emotion and here and all the while lays Fiona's stylish and purposeful playing, like a never ending reminder of this albums greatness.\n\nEarthbound, this is a gentle place visited by Fiona's delicate fingers, it's almost like each note has been lovingly caressed by her heaven like fingers into an almost calming composition that has that gentle mother like hand of the shoulder saying everything is going to work out fine and judging by this album, that's a truism and a half.\n\nKevin Kendle once composed a superb track called Gliders, here we have Gliding, this track was sublime and the premise is the same, it really floated with a deftness and calm ease that eased us into the middle of the album, the crafted piano style employed here by the artist is clever and well-paced, one can truly glide and float through this piece with peace.\n\nTango on a Wednesday, when I first saw the title I wondered what we were going to be in for here! Not that there was any concern on my part, but the unusual title found its way into this day of musical interludes with a grace and charm all of its own.\n\nWith horn and passionate playing and some very delicate guitar this is almost a dance of instrumentation that once more shows Fiona Joy Hawkins skill of being able to morph from several genres at a time.\n\nSo we move with slight of hand and quickness of mind to the track Running On joy, a reference to her mood? I think so; Fiona has found herself through this collection of amazing tracks and each and every album she releases.\n\nI detect a smattering of didge in here and bringing it back to her roots Hawkins with a wonderful mixed style of playing almost takes us on a journey through her life and to the point now it becomes so obvious with the harmonious combination of instruments and the world influence she is most defiantly running on joy.\n\nAncient Albatross took me back in time to the turn of the century, the late but great Jon Lord released an album called Pictured Within and this and if I may say quite stunning composition has almost the same energy as his soundtrack, of course a totally different piece and subject matter, but I am referring of course to the structure and emotive qualities within this piece, this one almost moved me to tears, you know those tears that one gets when they hear something so beautiful that words are an insult to such beauty.\n\nA shift to another theme, another place and time, imagine yourself in an empty theatre, as the spot lights shift to the stage and scan the empty stalls around you, a figure of a young girls dances in the dust filled lights of the stage in front of you, her dance begins to become intense, this perfection in dance is evident and this show is just for you, on a long lonely distant highway in time, you have witnessed the spirit of the The Lost Ballerina, listen to this piece and let me know what you think.\n\nNow to one of my favourite compositions from the entire album, I heard the story in our interview of how Fiona went on a journey to Antarctica and during her time, she composed this track entitled Antarctica! Having never been there myself I let my entire soul be engulfed in the music and I soon found myself transported to a wasteland of coldness beyond freezing, but within this very existence I felt a freedom that one can seemingly never have in a land filled with technology and other mind numbing devices.\n\nHere Fiona has created a land not only of music, but also of a frozen land of escape and solitude, such beautiful strings combined with her passion filled deep emotive sculpting makes this track a must to listen to and enjoy in the warmth of you own sacred place.\n\nTalking about freedom and by some amazing coincidence the track that is the penultimate one of the album is called Captured Freedom. Once more the strings come to the aid of the leading piano in such a way it is almost like a cry for help, the flute sold this for me, Fiona's craft is to create such emotional music that one cannot be moved by its very deep and meaningful nature, but with the flute coming in as well was the final and utterly brilliant master stroke that left us the listener wondering if we had captured freedom, of was our freedom captured.\n\nThe last track starts with a melancholy flute and is the climax to what has in truth been a breath taking album to review, very emotional and very heart felt and now we must take stock of all that we have heard as Fiona Joy Hawkins begins to draw the curtains on this musical sojourn, Forgiveness is a composition that almost teaches us the very lesson of the title itself and this is a gentle and loving and soul searching track to end with.\n\nIn 600 years in a moment Hawkins has pulled off what I can only call a masterpiece in the genre she is in, but what is that genre, certainly here Fiona Joy Hawkins has crossed cultural boundaries and taken us on a journey across all borders and brought the world a classic album that each and every one of you should really go on and purchase now, for this is an album that has been crafted by the hands of a genius.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Even when Brandon Flowers makes mistakes on \"Flamingo,\" his intriguing solo debut, they are extremely interesting mistakes.\n\nWith his quivering yet authoritative vocals - reminiscent, in an unusual way, of the late, wonderful Roy Orbison's - he charges through this selection of unique, quirky, often quite touching set of modern, urbane singer-songwriter pop with aplomb and conviction.\n\nProponents of Ryan Adams could credibly postulate that Flowers is perhaps taking some of Adams' artistic eccentricities and sprucing them up for a more palatable audience, but nonetheless...\n\nLead single \"Crossfire\" has earned critical repute and deserves far more radio success than it has thus far achieved. The poetic, effervescent lyrics and hopelessly scintillating (and purely catchy) chorus make the song an instant hit. Other potential hits exist in \"Hard Enough,\" a gorgeous, lyrically eloquent mid-tempo ballad co-written and co-performed with Jenny Lewis, whose expressive voice gels extremely well with Flowers'. The cathartic, prayerful \"On the Floor\" sounds as weightless as it does profoundly beautiful.\n\nThere are many intriguing misfires (perhaps `misfires' is too harsh a word) on the album as well. The bubbly, perky, 80s-styled \"Was It Something I Said?\" sounds like guttural Americana and retro bubble gum at the same time, but, much like the overlong, cliched \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas,\" it takes a long time to not quite catch its groove, sounding more like a very interesting idea for a song than a finished one.\n\nEven the promising \"Jilted Lovers and Broken Hearts\" is sprawling and in need of restraint, despite its urgent production and excellent display of Flowers' vocal range. It has a common problem for the record - Flowers' excesses as a song writer have not been reigned in. The songs are often overlong and in need of more focus. Perhaps this has to do with his going it alone without his Killers bandmates. Perhaps this has to do with Island Records giving him creative carte blanche for the project. Perhaps both.\n\nEven Tolstoy needed an editor.\n\nThe more forgettable material is still well-oiled due to Flowers' compelling, driving vocals and fine production work from Daniel Lanois, Brendan O'Brien and Stuart Price.\n\n\"Flamingo\" may not be an artistic triumph, but it is nothing to sneer at, either. Flowers is a quirky, brooding, highly inventive young artist, and while he is reminiscent of other performers (it is difficult not to be) he has a distinct sound of his own, even irrespective of the Killers, that he is beginning to hone quite well. It is a hell of a lot more interesting to hear an artist stumble a bit trying for something real and original than simply doing what has come before, and Flowers fulfills that desire. He is worth far more than a passing glance.\n\n(The bonus tracks were clearly left off the album for a reason - from the folksy, beat-poetry-like \"The Clock Was Tickin'\" and the atmospheric, pillow-padded, downbeat \"Jacksonville,\" these tunes would have diffused the atmosphere of the standard album were they included on it. They are inventive, idiosyncratic and worthwhile for the above-average fan or completest.)","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"If you grew amidst the 1960s folk revival, you may well remember a favorite Pete Seeger, Burl Ives or Johnny Cash record of great American folk songs. You might have been schooled by the Dillards (in the guise of the Darling Family) on The Andy Griffith Show, had parents who sang these songs as you drifted off to sleep, sang folk songs at camp or had a progressive grade school teacher who introduced these songs at music time. But it's probably been a few decades since folk songs were central to your life. Of course, you'll still hear many of these titles on Prairie Home Companion and at bluegrass festivals, but their mainstream circulation has dwindled, pushing their legacies to the fringe. And that's a shame, because these are great songs, rife with historical significance (both in their creation and in the stories they tell) and deep musical pleasures.\n\nSuzy Bogguss has collected seventeen titles, mostly well-known, and assembled them into a songbook of both musical and intellectual depth. In addition to her lovely acoustic renderings, assisted by a terrific band of musicians and backing vocalists, she's written a companion book that provides history and sheet music. The song backgrounds essay the unsettled origins of many songs (is \"Red River Valley\" a reference to a tributary of the Mississippi, a spur of the Hudson, or the valley drained by the Red River of the North?), the variations of their lyrics, and their paths to prominence. The sheet music is perfect for accompanying your home sing-along on piano or guitar, and the CD is sure to be a favorite for both parents and kids, not to mention a nutritious respite from calorie-free children's records.

From beginning to end, A Moon Shaped Pool sounds focused, and pointed, producing beautiful melodies and thoughtful lyrics. This is such a breath of fresh air and enthusiasm following the disappointment that was The King of Limbs.\n\nIt's worth noting this is one of the softest Radiohead releases, and I kept feeling, time and time again, as I listened, that Radiohead put their heart and soul into this production.

{"text":"Yes, I said it, I hate Nirvana.  However, Smells Like Teen Spirit is among my favorite songs of all time, as my redemption comment lol.  Before the fire and lava start pouring out of your ears, let me explain why I dislike them.  First I'm going to start off by fueling the fire and saying I think Kurt Cobain is among the worst songwriters in history because most, if not all, the songs were written while he was on drugs or drunk.  That to me does not make you a good writer.  It just means you can produce crappy noise for people who have no idea what music is.  He was a decent guitar player but even still sucked at it.  The SOLE reason for three stars was for the influence this CD had on pop-culture.  I would never ever own this, I'd get the few songs I like and call it good.  Nirvana was unquestionably one of the most influential bands in rock history according to our society, but to me that doesn't say much.  Black Sabbath, Cannibal Corpse, Johnny Cash, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Aerosmith, Slayer, and maybe Metallica were REAL rock and metal icons.  Nirvana brought grunge and alternative rock to the forefront but didn't really influence metal or heavy rock much.  They were just the Black Sabbath of the alternative scene, not rock in general.  I know everyone wants to stab my eyes repeatedly with a dull rusty butter knife right now, but hey, it's just how I feel.  Would I recommend this album?  Only to a collector, but not to rock or metal fans.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"It should be noted for those interested in the inclusion of Lady Gaga's \"Born This Way\" that the version here is not the hit version from the radio but instead the dance floor ready Starstruck Mix, which clocks in at 6:45 and, while full of zest, is no replacement for the catchy original.\n\nStill, it seldom gets more cost effective than nearly 40 tracks - most of them hit singles, many of them quite recent, others timeless radio staples - for 10 dollars. Add in the fact that the artists and their labels have waived their standard fees, which means all profits go to help those who are suffering in Japan, and \"Songs for Japan\" may justifiably become one of the year's highest sellers.\n\nOf course, some inclusions are less generous than others, such as Adele's take on Bob Dylan's \"Make You Feel My Love,\" popularized by Billy Joel, as opposed to one of her several larger hits. Still, the standard of quality persists, with a leaning toward strength-of-conviction anthems such U2's \"Walk On\" and the pure, unadulterated beauty of John Lennon's \"Imagine.\"\n\nThis makes tracks such as Pink's 2008 Top 20 hit \"Sober\" and Rihanna's recent chart-topper \"Only Girl (In the World)\" - not to mention Justin Timberlake's 2002 Michael Jackson mimicry \"Like I Love You\" - stand out like sore thumbs. Nevertheless, the amount of (mostly) solid music for the price is large.\n\nMadonna's \"Miles Away\" is represented by a solid live rendition on the digital release. It was one of the best tracks from her 2008 album \"Hard Candy\" and should have been a hit single. Other lesser-known gems include Bruce Springsteen's satisfying, underrated \"Human Touch\" from 1992.\n\nKings of Leon deserve commendation for turning down a paycheck in the name of the artistic beliefs and not licensing their music to Fox's \"Glee\" yet including their biggest hit (\"Use Somebody\") here without any profit to be had.\n\nSome of the sequencing is a bit odd, as though the track list was determined by drawing names from a hat. After all, a recent Justin Bieber recording (\"Pray\") sounds a bit jarring when so close in proximity to soothing Enya (\"If I Could Be Where You Are\") and classic Elton John (\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me\"). So does Shakira's 2001 smash \"Whenever, Wherever\" next to Norah Jones' gorgeous \"Sunrise.\"\n\n\"Songs for Japan\" is an impressive selection of music, precision-tooled to draw a large audience together to spread music and, most importantly, charity. A purchase is highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I recently saw the Decemberists in concert again (more on that later). It was my first time in almost a decade (8 years, to be exact) that I had seen them live, and during that span, they have grown into a widely popular band, both on the concert circuit as well as on the album charts.\n\n\"What A Terrible World, What A Beautiful World\" (14 tracks; 53 min.) starts off with the very subdued \"The Singer Addresses His Audience\", but things immediately pick up with \"Calvary Captain\", which reminds me of REM's \"Losing My Relogion\". In fact, it is amazing how many similarities, sound-wise, there are between the Decemberists and REM, and with REM having retired from the music scene, the Decemberists clearly have taken over that sweet spot where pop-folk-Americana convene. \"What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World\" finds the band relaxed yet very confident, and the resulting album is strong throughout. Other highlights for me include the pensive \"The Wrong Year\", the ironic \"Anti-Summersong\", and the album's closer \"A Beginning Song\".\n\nI recently saw the Decemberists at the rapidly-growing Bunbury Music Festival here in Cincinnati. The band was the next-to-last to play on the second main stage on a hot and humid Saturday evening, but the weather didn't stop them from bringing us a 60 min. set that bristled with energy. The career-spanning set of course was heavy on the new album, starting off with \"A Beginning Song\" (which makes a lot more sense than having it as the album's loser), then going to \"Calvary Captain\" before going \"Down By The Water\", and on and on. It was a brilliant set, period, and one of THE highlights of the festival for me. The MASSIVE crowd absolutely ate it up. If you have a chance to see the Decemberists in concert, do not miss them! Meanwhile, \"What A Terrible World, What A Beautiful World\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"After a hiatus from music, Matchbox Twenty\/20 is back in business, at least for this half best-of\/ep, then it's back to the solo work. So, you could look at this as their comeback song, and it greatly tides over our thirst for everything MB20. First off, the lyrics are incredible just like they are with any MB20 song, with lyrics like, \"I'm waking up at the start of the end of the world\/ but it feels just like every other morning before.\" The song is catchy and well-written, and overall just well done. And even though this is a rather successful single, it doesn't really sound it. In fact, most of the best songs on their albums were singles anyhow. The bridge is also great musically, and the only thing that could get me down on this song is the chorus. While it is a great chorus for concerts, and to get you pumping, it just seems like more could have been done to it.\n\nBut overall, a great song, a great single, a great group.

{"text":"So Trent Reznor has been making music for a long time now and ever since \"With Teeth\", he has been in one of his most prolific periods.\n\nAlso, even since \"With Teeth\", it seems like he has been getting more and more minimalistic with his work.  Do not get me wrong, it is still good and this album as well as his newest one, The Slip, are both awesome.  This is an instrumental work that covers a broad range of musical styles and moods, but as I was saying, it is more and more minimalistic.\n\nIf you are a NIN fan, you must own this.  If you are a fan of electronic music, this might suit you, but you are a fan of only the poppy NIN stuff or the radio hits, this is not the album for you, but on that same note, the entire cd is only 5 bucks, so you might as well check it out and if you do not like it, you are only out a couple of bucks in the end.","classification":4,"fold":0}
{"text":"Call this what you want, a cash grab, a tribute to Rick Wright or just a collection of outtakes from The Division Bell that should have just been left as outtakes and nothing more.  If these tracks were good enough to be released now then maybe they should have been included on the original album instead of releasing now as a separate album.  What would have done more justice to the outtakes would have been to have totally remastered The Division Bell including these tracks where they were originally meant to be.  Now, that would have been a tribute to Rick Wright and would have done them justice.  Lest anyone forget also that Roger Waters was the driving force behind Pink Floyd (except for the last two albums), not Gilmour and I might have the tendency to agree with other reviewers that Waters would have never released anything like this, but who knows.  The argument will continue to the end of time of the Gilmour Pink Floyd vs. the Waters Pink Floyd versions of the band.  While I'm not necessarily thrilled with this album there are only a couple of good tracks for me and it's always nice to hear some new music from Gilmour.  But, other than that this is just a collection of ambient music that suits some, but not others and that's just the way it is.  Either you believe Gilmour regarding the reasoning of this album or you don't.  Plain and simple.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Basicially,after over half a century in the musi business this is Ron Isley's debut solo recording without his brothers or pairing him up with another performer. When I first heard this was coming out I instantly had in mind not only Isley's ability to transend generations and musical trends but also his OG style appeal that he's worn proudly in the last two decades almost as a badge of honor. This needless to say makes him very appealing to many new school hip-hoppers who've adopted his attitude and image so many Isley related albums during this period have been highly geared toward the contemporary hip-hop\/R&B crowd. Now that would be fine if that genre itself hasn't been reduced to one of the most generic sounds R&B has ever produced,filled with digital clishes and very little creativity in the songwriting. Ron Isley,whether on original material or as a vocal interpreter needs either the right sort of production and\/or instrumentation to really become himself. And sadly a good deal of this album just plain doesn't provide that.\n\n  Two of the more interesting songs are the acoustic guitar based single \"No More\" and a similarly themed cover of \"You've Got A Friend\" with Aretha Franklin looking,to a degree to recreate some of the magic created on the last famed male\/female R&B pairing on this song:Roberta Flack And Donny Hathaway. And all the same these tunes are just alright and frankly,\"just alright\" is NOT good enough for either of these soul titans. A good cross section of this material,the main culprit being \"Put Your Money On Me\" with T.I are very very clished attempts at mining the contemporary digitized hip-hop\/R&B style that pretty much defined the most recent Isley Brothers album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Baby-Makin-Music\/dp\/B000BY8278\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Baby Makin' Music<\/a>. Frankly,at least to my ears this sound has become beyond tiresome and it's rigid,overly repetitive nature doesn't really suit Ron Isley at all aside from his ability to adapt to the times. But if the music doesn't work frankly,why should he?\n\n  Another issue that is important about this album is how utterly lacking in uptempo funky and soul it is. The two most compelling of the R&B type tunes on this album are the midtempo \"Dance For Me\" and \"What I Miss Most\" and frankly neither of them are all that strong or powerful. It's not a terrible album but isn't that destinctive considering the source and none of the songs really stand out particularly well. And I don't entirely blame the hip-hop connection either because the Isley's 1996 album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mission-to-Please\/dp\/B000001E9B\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mission to Please<\/a>&nbsp;was a collection of new jack inflected ballads with R Kelly and remains one of their best albums in terms of production and songwriting. Even the best of people in any genre have to have something of a dud in their career; this is not the first time such as thing has happened to Ron Isley and doubtlessly won't be the last. But I can only hope that,should he choose to continue his solo career that he sets the bar a bit higher in terms of quality standards next time around.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"The punk rock world was in a questionable state by the turn of the millennium.  One group that undoubtedly ruled the '90s scene -- Green Day, in October of 2000, would issue a nearly-all-acoustic record (\"Warning\"), which, while being okay, seemed to signal a change in direction, that could have been seen as a death-knell for the genre.  Were it not, that is, for a new crop of young bands, all of whom were just pre-teens in 1994 when Green Day released \"Dookie,\" that emerged around this time to save the day and inject some much-needed youthful vitriol to the sound.\n\nPerhaps the first group in this scene to break through to the mainstream during this era was Toronto, Ontario's Sum 41, who began recording their second release and the album being reviewed, \"All Killer, No Filler\", in October of Y2K, just as Green Day were clearly moving on to pastures anew.\n\nWow!  Talk about this record being a return to form for punk!  After a mood-setting intro, on track number two \"Nothing On My Back,\" the listener is introduced to the band's striking, distinctive, and razor-sharp guitar sound, which was equal parts traditional punk-rock reverb and equal parts pure attitude.  It is a guitar tone that is truly raw, inspired, and decidedly \"old school\" -- and was indeed copied ten times over by acts that would follow.  Often imitated, but never duplicated, because no one ever did it again like Sum did.\n\nAnd yet, on this same opener, it is made clear that the group also have the tunes to back it up, and then some!  From vocalist\/co-guitarist Deryck Whibley's ultra-memorable vocal lines and defiant sneer to bassist Cone's well-placed and twanging mid-song interlude, these guys prove they're the real deal, and it doesn't let up from there.  This cut segues into the 50-second \"Never Wake Up,\" which is a fast and furious monster and as good of a take on hardcore punk as any I've heard.  The two best songs, though, lie in the disc's second half.  One is \"Summer,\" a rerecording from the group's debut \"Half Hour of Power,\" and boy, is it a masterpiece!  The main driving force in it is a simple, three-chord progression, but it proves that sometimes the simplest riffing can also be the most effective.  And that chorus -- you will not get it out of your head for days!  No doubt, one of Sum's signature tunes.  Perhaps my all-time favorite, though, is track number ten, \"Crazy Amanda Bunkface.\"  This one is two minutes and 16 seconds of pure punk rock bliss, and Deryck's raging guitar solo, which is somewhat reminiscent of Green Day's earlier \"Haushinka,\" will surely have you cranking the sound to maximum levels and basking in the euphoria.  Again, a cut virtually unrivalled in the confines of punk.\n\nAnd there you have it -- 32 minutes of great music, with absolutely no boring spots anywhere to be found, that will surely have you putting \"All Killer, No Filler\" on repeat.  I know there was a time in the mid-2000s that I used to air this album in its entirety daily, and almost exactly 15 years on from its release, it hasn't dated one bit or lost its power to enthrall you.  I want to add that I'm 41 (incidentally) and have been listening to underground punk rock (Dead Kennedys, Government Issue, the F.U.'s, et al) for decades, and I still think that \"All Killer, No Filler\" is among the best-crafted punk LPs in my collection, with perhaps the highest replay value of them all.

{"text":"Keith is an awesome songwriter and singer, and this album showcases his musical talents! His vocal rang is amazing, and I love to hear him sing. I first heard him sing, of course, in his place as part of Celtic Thunder (music that is also wonderful), and I loved his solo's in their shows. But this album is all Keith. There are a couple of covers on the cd --Have I Told You Lately That I Love You and Everybody's Talking At Me, but he takes even these songs and makes them his own. My favorite songs on the cd are 'Tears of Hercules', 'Don't Forget About Me' and The Heart of Saturday NIght', but truly I love them all. Keith also plays guitar wonderfully, as you can hear on this album. I have just about worn out my \"The Very Best of Celtic Thunder' cd and this cd by Keith the name of which is simply Keith Harkin! Well worth checking out for those of you who love Celtic Thunder and for those of you who just want to hear some wonderful music by an amazing young musician.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Chase Cut: This album was a huge disappointment...\n\nFine Print: After hearing the pop-punk influenced single \"take me away\", I had to have this CD. So I went out, bought it, and quickly tried to sell it back. It was total crap, boring as hell and quickly forgetable. This IS NOT pop-punk...its soul rock, and man does that ever blow!!!!\n\n1. Stupid Little Love Song...Just that, STUPID. Sure the guitar and drums SOUND like something by SR-71 or Blink, but the music IS FAR FROM PUNK 2\/10\n\n2. Bye Bye Boyfriend...I have a softspot for this song, don't ask me why, but i do 5\/10\n\n3. Take me Away...The first single, and very deceptive. None of the album sounds ANYTHING like this 7\/10\n\n4. Everything...BORING!!!!1\/10\n\n5. Rock It Till You Drop It...My least favorite, and that says a whole hell of alot -100000\/10\n\n6. Revolution Song...No need to read the lyric sheet. Its the the words \"Na Na Na\" over and over again for 5 f**kin minutes straight 0\/10\n\n7. Kiss me fool...More crap. Stupid lyrics and forgetable music make this one a big ZERO\/10\n\n8. Unforgiven...Another softspot song. Its actually pretty catchy, and its about the only one i actually like while listening to the album 8\/10\n\n9. We went for a ride...the melody is okay, but the song is just so boring its not worth my time 2\/10\n\n10. Give it up...The lyrics are stupid as hell, but the music is okay 2\/10\n\n11. Julia...Yuck! This one Sucks a** 0\/10\n\n12. 8x10...This one gives me a headache, seriously. 1\/10\n\n13.

{"text":"I just finished downloading (from the cloud) and there's a problem.  Four of the tracks will not play on Windows Media Player or on Winamp (on a Windows XP system).\nThe bad tracks are:\n (disc 1) track 04\n (disc 1) track 08\n (disc 2) track 10\n (disc 2) track 13\nIf I try to open them in Windows Media Player, nothing happens; the name doesn't even appear in the playlist.\nIf I try to open them in Winamp, then (disc 1) track 01 (Canon) plays instead!\n\nI believe that the problem is caused by the file name\/path being too long.  Windows won't even let you rename them in the normal way.\n\nUPDATE: I've found a workaround to the file problem, which is listed at the end of this review.*\n\nALSO:  Several of the tracks are NOT relaxing, IMHO.  For example, disc 1 track 9 (Violin Sonata) has several passages that become quite loud and full of angst...  not relaxing to me.  Disc 2 track 4 (Ballade No. 1) has several sections that are quite loud and heavy-handed, and a section near the end that is quite agitated.  Disc 2 track 10 (Sonata for Two Pianos) begins quietly, but has several passages that become quite loud and aggressive.  Disc 2 track 16 (Minuet in G) has a few sections that are downright bombastic, with the piano hammering out the bass line in octaves while the orchestra plays fortissimo.\n\nIndeed, classical music is not necessarily intended to be soporific.  But the selection on this pair of MP3 \"discs\" seems to be quite erratic.  To point out just one glaring example:  where is Brahms' Lullabye?\n\nBuy this as a general sampler, if you like.  But do NOT expect to be relaxed and lulled to sleep when it's finished.\n\n* FILE REPAIR SOLUTION\n\nAs I suspected, the problem is the excessive length of the file name and \"path\" (the entire route that the computer takes to get to the files).  Windows allows a maximum of 255 characters for the path + name.\n\nBy default, when you download these, Amazon will put them in this path:\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Documents\\Amazon\\Various Artists\\A Collection of the Most Relaxing Classical Music in the Universe\\\nThat's 135 characters right there, which leaves 120 characters for the track name.\n\nNow let's consider the name of one of the non-functional files:\n(disc 2) 10 - Sonata for Two Pianos in F minor, Op. 34b_ II. Andante, _un poco adagio_ - Sonata for Two Pianos in F minor, Op. 34b_ II. Andante, _un poco adagio_.mp3\nThat's 165 characters.  So the total is 135 + 165 = 300 characters, well over the 255-character limit.  Windows just can't handle that!\n\nAs a workaround, after you have downloaded all the files, navigate to the folder as listed above.  Temporarily rename the folder something very short, like \"XYZ\" (without the quotation marks).  That's 65 characters shorter than the original file name.  Now the totals are under 255 characters, so Windows will let you rename the individual files.  Go through and chop out all the duplicate information.  In the example given above, you'll cut out 72 characters, leaving a total of 93 characters.  Do this for all the tracks.\n\nFinally, if you want, you can go back and rename the folder to something reasonable, like \"Relaxing Classical Music\" which will give you a total length of 94 characters.  If you add the new file name (from the example above) which is 93 characters, you'll see that you end up with a total of 187 characters, well UNDER the 255 character limit.\n\nOf course one wonders:  Why didn't Amazon think about this, and use a reasonable album name, and file names WITHOUT duplication, in the first place.\n\nMY CONCLUSION:  Given that at least four of the tracks are NOT relaxing, and you'll have to spend at least 15 minutes screwing around to fix the file naming errors, IMHO this collection just isn't worth the trouble, even if it's free to begin with.  Of course if you're really hard up for music that is MAYBE relaxing... go for it.\n\nPersonally, I think Amazon could and should do a better job.  I know I would, if I worked for them.","classification":1,"fold":0}

I wonder what Patsy Cline would make of him if she had lived a long life, given that she was reluctant to record Crazy, because she didn't like his voice :-) I suppose it is an acquired taste, but millions of us have acquired that taste.\n\nNot many singers could record an album this good at 80, but Willie has proved with this album that it can be done.","classification":5,"fold":0}

The miss came down to the song Team, and the lagging heart she showed in the song. Tennis Court unfortunately delivers the same lagging heart that shows in the same way that Team did. The third single isn't as astride as well as Royals showed when it had came out. I just found the song to miss what she had when she came out. It really isn't as strong as what could've been. She still has a lot going for her, if she finds better to match her voice. But lets hope that there is better for love than this song is on the tennis court.

Alot of the lyrics are pure poetry; expressing love, exhortation, positivity, and all the things that would make us better people to humanity, ourselves, and loved ones.\nThe vocals and music showcased on this stellar project are warm and enchanting. \"The Truth\" is my absoulte favorite track with its haunting background vocals and its acoustic spanish motiff. \"Little Things\" is tight and has that \"All That I Can Say\" by Mary J. music flavor. \"The One\" is a catchy tune that will have you singin' \"Laa Laa Laa Lalalala\". \"Interested\" has a nice groove that gets the neck to moving and foot stomping.

{"text":"Ledisi - Soulsinger (2000)\nWord has it that this album is to be rereleased this year on Tommy Boy Records. If this is true, then I'm glad that she's getting a second chance. Soulsinger is filled with Ledisi's ability to mix little spoken word with jazz, R&B, and soul. She puts her all in every performance, as evidenced in \"Take Time\" and \"Coffee\". She has the voice of a throaty Southern gospel choir singer and she truly delivers. It's too bad that some of these songs have uninspired lyricism like in \"Groove On\", a song about her wanting a one-night stand. Also, she tends to sing so hard that she gets off-key, which is a problem throughout the album. But it's hard to find powerful singers like her these days and by listening to \"Free Again\" and the very revealing \"Poppa Loved to Love Me\", Ledisi should start getting props soon. -EJR","classification":4,"fold":0}

Woke up a second time, same sweat...SAME SONG & HOOK.  It's hard to go back to sleep hearing or seeing the same dream, and yet after this second time I heard it, followed same routine of wiping sweat off and going back to bed...A THIRD TIME...SAME SONG & HOOK!

{"text":"When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, she has been the most overexposed artist of the past decade, and sadly the quality of her voice has died in each and every note she has sung. For her music, she really has lost the drive in her newer music. When she made word late last year that she had a surprise record, sadly for her the word was not even close to the hype in her music. That has even showed with the numerous collaborations she had done with her husband Jay-Z. Their latest collaboration Drunk In Love does not come close to igniting. It sounds more like she is trying to be in Hip Hop, than a songstress. Sadly, the chemistry she and Jay-Z have in song has died and in fact sounds worse than any of the earlier songs she and Jay-Z had done before like Deja Vu and Crazy In Love. I think the next time she pulls a rabbit out of the hat like that, it should feel more timid and loveable than lagging like a wild hare. She really has lost it, and sadly doing work with her husband feels more like a snore than being drunk in love.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":0}
{"text":"After his 2006 album \"Release Therapy\", Ludacris seemed to get a lot of criticism for a deeply personal album that wasn't really that bad. He bounced back with his best effort to date- 2008's \"Theater Of The Mind\" and things seemed to be going well- at least that's how Ludacris tells it. He talked about a concept album called \"Battle Of The Sexes\"- a duet album between himself and Shawnna (best known for appearing on his song \"What's Your Fantasy\" and her hit \"Gettin' Some\"). Unfortunately, Shawnna abandoned the project midway through completion, and rather than shelve the album, Ludacris soldiered on with the project. The end result is Shawnna appearing only on three songs- \"I Do It All Night\", \"B.O.T.S. Radio\" and the phone sex inspired \"Feelin' So Sexy\".\n\nThere are other guests who fill the absence left by Shawnna. Nicki Minaj steps in for the song \"My Chick Bad\", Ne-Yo appears on the Swizz Beatz produced \"Tell Me A Secret\", and Trey Songz makes a cameo on the rather dull \"Sex Room\". The songs \"Everybody Drunk\" and \"Party No Mo'\" are horribly out of place on this album. In fact, the only song that actually is in line with the concept of the album is \"B.O.T.S. Radio\". Things come to a close with the final track, The Neptunes produced \"Sexting\" which makes light of the Tiger Woods scandal. The problem with this album- aside from the production- is the album overall is misleading regarding the concept of \"Battle Of The Sexes\". The album title should have been \"Pandering To The Sexes\" being that is what's done on the entire album. If you're a Ludacris fan, you may want to sit this one out.","classification":2,"fold":0}

While the album itself never lets up - it's a great driving album, let's face it... especially in a sports car on a twisty road... the album does indeed sound \"flat\" and very compressed in some instances. Where the music should be soaring and taking you with it, it feels strangled and you're left with that ... almost, but not quite... feeling.\nOverall, the album is good and if you can overlook the basic music inadequacies, you'll be happy with the purchase.","classification":4,"fold":0}
{"text":"Cher is at it again.  Now nearly 56 years of age, Cher is still fighting the inevitable tide of time.  This time, as with her last \"effort\" \"Believe\", Cher (with platinum hair--will it translate to platinum sales?  I doubt it) continues her foray into the world of trippy dance beats and nuevo-disco stylings as the listener is bombarded with studio wizardry and up-to-date technology (and Cher's unique voice).  The songs (as is usually the case with Cher) are penned by songwriters (i.e., not Cher herself although she did have a hand (ha!) in writing the first \"tune\") and Cher is backed by a slew of competent studio musicians and masterful, clinical, overproduction.  To me, this sounds like technology for technology sake and not for the sake of the music.  On the bright side, it does tend to obscure Cher's questionable \"talent\" somewhat and that can't be all bad.  If you go for dance music, stick with the experts and not some \"artist\" trying to stave off irrelevance.  If you're someone who digs Cher, you'll buy this anyway (and maybe even dance to it--ha ha ha!!!).  The bottom line:  Overproduced dance music that's been done better by many others.

{"text":"It is so sad that whenever someone is talented, they really throw their voice away, and no longer show that they were once talented, and instead scared with strife and heartbreak. Sadly, Beyonce' Knowles has been one of those \"products\" that has stopped showing her own voice. Instead, she has been forced to severely overexpose herself, where other artists haven't even been able to deliver in sound and soul from the voice within. It is too sad that Beyonce' Knowles has been such a joke, that her voice tragically died over a decade ago, after she and Destiny's Child broke up. A few years ago, when she came out with a surprise record in 2013, it really has been more of a joke, and showed that she does not want to flex her vocals into higher territory. Her 2016, \"surprise, not surprise joke\" album Lemonade has been another disaster, focusing in on a scarred heart, with a upcoming split between her and Jay-Z whom had cheated on her. Most of the tracks were pathetic and Sorry, her latest single from the album is another weak song from her.. The song is chinsy, cheap, and is another faded joke in song. She really hasn't grown up enough. With more bad songs like this, I'd say to Beyonce' Knowles, retire from music and start her life over again. She has a lot of scars from her breakup with Jay-Z that need more healing than her career could show. Another failure.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":0}

(MAS\/SMAS-2363) is radically different than its UK counterpart but is also a legitimate motion picture soundtrack. The LP contains all seven songs from the movie, plus five cuts of instrumental film music composed by Ken Thorne and performed by George Martin's orchestra. This eighth CAPITOL Beatles album was #1 on Billboard's 200 for nine weeks.\n\nReleased as a single in April of '65, \"Ticket to Ride\" was #1 in both Britain and the U.S. The Fabs' July '65 single of \"Help!\" equalled this. No other songs from this LP charted.\n\nAlnum opening \"Help!\" includes a 007-like instrumental intro heard in the picture's title sequence. \"From Me to You Fantasy\" is film score that includes sitar. On \"In the Tyrol\" a brief martial tune is followed by an adaptation of \"Seigfried's Rhine Journey.\" Sitar is featured again on \"Another Hard Day's Night,\" along with tabla, oud and a flutelike instrument on strains of \"Can't Buy Me Love\" and \"I Should Have Known Better.\" The air of intrigue start of \"Bitter End\" hints at \"You Can't Do That.\" Bass strings simmer until the full orchestra comes in. Electric guitar is the final element added. \"The Chase\" is another raga of much energy.\n\nSIDE ONE\n[2:35] Help!\n[2:33]The Night Before\n[2:03] From Me to You Fantasy\n[2:08] You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\n[2:28] I Need You\n[2:21] In the Tyrol: Introducing Wagner's Overture to Act III of \"Lohengrin\" Beatles Style\n\nSIDE TWO\n[2:02] Another Girl\n[2:28] Another Hard Day's Night\n[3:03] Ticket to Ride\n[2:20] The Bitter End \/ You Can't Do That\n[2:18] You're Gonna Lose That Girl\n[2:24] The Chase\n\nTOTAL TIME: 28:43","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Randy Rogers and Wade Bowen were right.  There is room for country in country music.  The numbers its been putting up on iTunes sales as well as on Amazon that there must be people out there who are hungry for something more when it comes to country music.\n\nWhen I first heard of this albums release, I couldn't wait.  I knew it was going to be something special.  Two of my absolute favorite artists were putting out a collaborative studio album.  Two artists with distinctive styles who frequently collaborate on writing and who do regular shows together were finally giving the nation a taste of what their region has known for years  these two are masters of the craft and among the best in the business.\n\nAnd then it happened: Standards was released as a preview track and we had our first inkling of what this album was going to be like.  And the impression was good.\n\nThe album works perfectly.  This isn't simply two artists deciding to put an album out together: these are two artists whove worked together, who know each other, who can play off each other musically and in their personalities.  And thats what they do.  Songs like Good Luck With That showcase a banter between these two which could just as easily be a conversation that they're having over a beer, backed by true country instrumentation and beat.  In the Next Life works in a similar way.\n\nStandards, which at this point weve all already heard in advance of the album is of course their own version of a protest song.  I don't have hits, Ive got standards, the two singers say when they're asked to cut a song that will be a hit but isn't true to them.  And a song like El Dorado even harken back to the days when country music was called Country and Western.  Its a very throw-back song and Id call it one of my favorites on the album, right along with Til It Does (if I could find a way to get any of these songs out of my head).\n\nHangin Out in Bars is a song where the singers try to get over a breakup by going out to bars.  While this may sound like standard country fare, these two make it work by showing the toll that it takes on them; they manage to make a fun song while still acknowledging that this lifestyle isn't going to lead to anything good.  Those consequences though are never explored in the song though  only the knowledge that they're right around the corner.\n\nLady Bug was another song that Wade and Randy shared in advance of the record.  Its a simple feel-good tune about looking for a sign of something good in otherwise hard times.  Sure, that may sound depressing when you read just that, but the song is just so much damn fun that you cant help but smile when listening to it!\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of this album is its overall feel.  Neither artist own this album: its exactly what its billed as  a collaborative effort.  Neither artist outshines the other, and neither artist is trying either.  As Ive said more than once in this review already, these are two artists whove known and respected each other for a long time, and thats what shines through on the album.\n\nMy hard copy of the album got delayed in the mail and still hasn't arrived, so I only received my digital copy of the product today.  The digital copy that came from my pre-order from RandyAndWade.com also included two live bonus tracks, Randy Rogers Lost & Found and Wade Bowens Trouble.  These are great songs from each of their individual catalogs.\n\nThe album has a Vol. 1 as part of its title.  Im hoping that this means that in the near future, there will be a Vol. 2.\n\nFOLLOW OPINIONS ON COUNTRY MUSIC AT HOPEFORCOUNTRYMUSIC.WEEBLY.COM","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"In much the same way that Run The Jewels with El-P and Killer Mike joined two pretty humongous, previously unassociated rap camps for a detour into cruel punk rap songs, Czarface (Wu-Tang Clan's Inspectah Deck with Boston's 7L & Esoteric) are putting their unique spin on the genre with a personality and mike-disposition nearly identical to RTJ's. Their self titled Czarface debut became an instant underground smash in 2013 and revealed that the Rebel INS plus 7L & Eso mix very well with each other.\n\nTheir second official release, Every Hero Needs A Villain, is almost a mirror-image of their first, save for a new set of guests (Method Man, Large Professor, Juju of The Beatnuts, GZA, MF Doom, Meyhem Lauren, R.A. the Rugged Man) and all- original rhyme verses in each track of course. In any case, EHNAV is a strong album sustained by epic, raw lyrics and more of 7L and Spada4's industrial and grunge rock-inspired alternative beats. Ambitious on both its vocal and instrumental fronts, the album's main concerns are to appall (with coarse, sometimes violent imagery), impress (with dizzying, nonstop rhyme schemes) and exhilarate (with artsy, indie, experimental production), and by all intensive purposes, they've more or less reached their goal.\n\nDespite having few social implications or a variety of concepts (it truly has only one), EHNAV flourishes by being a rich greenhouse of thriving hip hop excitement, a wild comicbook-like rap album. The most important meaning behind this project however is its continuation of healthy collaboration between two rap acts from substantially different backgrounds, Inspectah Deck from the rough and tumble Staten Island, New York and producer\/emcee team 7L & Esoteric from the more congenial backdrops of Boston, Massachusetts. Both have overlooked some of their cultural disparities to commune on their shared love for hip-hop.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"This is a Jazz album that everyone should have in their collection. The Oscar Peterson Trio is joined Milt Jackson and what a beautiful album they create together.\n\nRecorded in 1961 the album starts with On Green Dolphin Street. This is mellow and laid back for a while and then changes gear to swing. Perhaps the most noticeable thing about this track is Peterson's very restrained and delicate Piano solo. Even when the solo reaches the swing section there aren't the torrents of notes that you might expect. This is Oscar Peterson showing a different facet to his great talent.\n\nOf course part of the reason for Petersons restraint on the first track maybe because a couple of the other tracks are absolute barnstormers. In particular Work Song and Reunion Blues swing like hell. Milt Jackson plays with a fire that, to me, was sometimes missing from his work with the MJQ. Listen on these tracks for Ed Thigpens great drumming. He really hits some great accents when you really don't expect them - and they work! Combine his work with the relentless Ray Browns bass and you have a swinging backdrop that could make much lesser musicians sound good.\n\nSadly only Oscar Peterson survives from this marvellous quartet at the time of writing. This disc captures them all at the height of their abilities and is an essential purchase.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"\"New religion\" is the brand new, second studio album by Swedish up and coming rock band \"Crazy Lixx\". In terms of sound the band has been classified anything amongst sleaze metal, glam metal and hard rock.\n\nWith their 2007 debut \"...Lix\" established themselves as one of the leading glam\/sleaze bands of their generation, featuring a very expressive frontman\/lead singer in Danny Rexon and the very accomplished guitarist Vic Zino (who has since left the band, having joined `Hardcore Superstar').\n\n2010 Finds the band in an even higher artistic form than the previous album; Zino is replaced by the equally talented Andy Dawson never forgetting the ever-present Loke Rivano on bass and Joel Cirera on drums. In terms of sound not much has changed in the \"...Lixx\" camp, since \"New Religion\" walks the same path as their debut. I have to say however that this new album has many more memorable songs than their previous release.\n\nThe \"Loud minority\" debut spawned a hit single in \"Heroes are forever\", the new album offers a real handful of potential hits. Indeed \"21 `til I die\" is straight up tempo rocker in the style of \"Heroes are forever\", but the real surprise comes with the mid tempo inclusions of \"Children of the cross\" a -too considerate for hair metal- song very close in sound to the band \"Talisman\". And of course there is the amazingly melodic \"Blame it on love\" demonstrating large choruses and those crying backing vocals that make the track absolutely irresistible.\n\n\"Crazy Lixx\" are determined to retain their title as one of the most promising newcomers in European hair metal\/hard rock; and, in fact, none of that seems to have changed with \"New Religion\" it just got bigger and better!!","classification":5,"fold":0}

The track was first released on September 18, 2012 as the fourth single from his fourth studio album, Wild Ones.[1] The song is based on Bingo Players' \"Cry (Just a Little)\" which samples \"Piano in the Dark\" by Brenda Russell. \"I Cry\" was produced by the French production duo soFLY & Nius and the Futuristics, and it was written by Flo Rida, The Futuristics, Scott Cutler, Jeffrey Hull, Brenda Russell, and soFLY & Nius.\n\"I Cry\" received mixed reviews from music critics, who criticized its lyrical content and production, and stated that it would have been better with a collaboration with Sia Furler, who previously collaborated with Flo Rida on the song, \"Wild Ones\". However, some critics were positive towards its catchiness and club-nature. The song received commercial success upon its release, peaking inside the top ten in many countries including Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States.

{"text":"I hear people complaining how bad this album is, that \"Soilwork have turned to crappy nu-metal or they're not melo-death!\" Seriously, if you think THIS album sucks, go buy Metallica's horrible excuse for a new album \"St. Anger\", or that that new album from Limp Bizkit. True \"Stabbing The Drama\" isn't Soilwork's best album, but is sure blows the previous release \"Figure Number Five\" right out of the water, and at least the drummer doesn't sound like he's banging his drum sticks on trash cans, and that guitarists Ola Frenning and Peter Wichers still know how to solo. Now that I got that out of my chest, I will now review the album. 2005's \"Stabbing The Drama\", Soilwork's sixth album is one of the best metal albums I bought this year. Like I said before, this blows FNF out of the water. Even thought the bass and keyboards are somewhat drowned out (due to the bit faulty production), this album still has great vocals from Speed Strid, catchy guitar riffs and some nice solos from Peter Wichers and Ola Frenning, and some very good drumming as well. My favorite songs on here are \"Stabbing The Drama\", \"One With The Flies\" (which is very catchy), \"Weapon Of Vanity\", \"Stalemate\", \"Nerve\", \"Distance\", and \"Blind Eye Halo\" (which is an excellent dose of traditional Soilwork brutality and aggression).\n\nthemetalbeast's track ratings:\n\n1. Stabbing The Drama: 5\/5\n\n2. One With The Flies: 5\/5 (Very catchy, nice solo)\n\n3. Weapon Of Vanity: 5\/5\n\n4. The Crestfallen: 4\/5\n\n5. Nerve: 5\/5\n\n6. Stalemate: 5\/5\n\n7. Distance: 5\/5\n\n8. Observation Slave: 4\/5\n\n9. Fate In Motion: 4\/5\n\n10. Blind Eye Halo: 5\/5 (Very aggressive song, I love it)\n\n11. If Possible (Bonus Track): 5\/5\n\n12. Wherever Thorns May Grow (Bonus Track): 5\/5\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nIs \"Stabbing The Drama\" a horrible sell-out album, an underrated masterpiece, or just a misunderstood album. Truly a misunderstood, underrated masterpiece, and one of 2005's best. You might be disappointed if you're acustomed to Soilwork's older albums, but if you're a true Soilwork fan, or just have a great taste in music, feel free to purchase this.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Although Isadar's latest solo piano album was timed to release around Valentine's Day because of its love-inspired themes, the music is wide-ranging and versatile enough to be enjoyed all year long.\n\nThe real love that comes through on the CD is that which Isadar clearly has for music and the piano, as evidenced by his brilliant and quirky songwriting and passionate performances. Some of the tunes are subtle and intimate, and others are grand and sweeping, but they are all clever and original thanks to Isadar's convention-defying compositions. Sometimes you think you know where the music's leading you, and then all of a sudden it comes at you out of left field, making it lively and engaging.\n\nThis writing style keeps Isadar's fingers on their toes, so to speak. Isadar's mastery of his craft is apparent in the seemingly effortless ease with which he can go from light to dark and from understated to emphatic. His phrasing and chord progressions are also smart and snappy.\n\nThis is a rewarding experience for those who are willing to accompany Isadar on his musical journey of love.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Shinedowns vocalist Brent Smith and guitarist Zach Myers strip down and unplug to cover several classics and their choices are surprising and broad ranging from seminal punk (The Clashs London Calling), blues (Kenny Wayne Shepherds Blue On Black), old Rhythm and Blues (Otis Reddings Sitting On the Dock of the Bay), heavy metal (Metallicas Nothing Else Matters), and alternative (Soul Asylums Runaway Train).  The categories are even more varied if you count the second release which includes contemporary pop (Adeles Someone Like You) and some old school 80s rock (Phil Collins In the Air Tonight).  There are ten songs over two releases and this first release accounts for six of the tracks.  All are live recordings but the production and levels are so good, so crisp, with audience volume and fuzz kept to a bare minimum that it might as well be a studio recording.  I like that, and another thing too, with Smith introducing each songs name and artist before they put the song out in a solid and clear presentation.  Smiths vocals are powerful but he doesnt try to overreach, or to make the song his own, or add too much to it.  The translations are pretty simple and straightforward.  My favorite of this lot would be their cover of Metallicas Nothing Else Matters wherein Smith soars to add that emotional punch right at the right moment.","classification":4,"fold":0}
{"text":"When it has came down to Whitney Houston's best movie songs, the one that is always turned to is the definitive I Will Always Love You from The Bodyguard. But to follow it up with Waiting To Exhale, Whitney continued to make \"her-story\" of her own as well. Exhale (Shoop Shoop,) is a sweet and simple song that ignites well in simplicity and soulfulness. It because the first song from a movie to debut at #1 on Billboard in 1995, and it still shows a lot of soul and simplicity. I have always liked the song because it really is better than most of the jokes on radio today. While Whitney somberly passed away a year ago, her songs still carry a tune beautifully. If you are discovering Whitney Houston for the first time, this is one song I definitely recommend for your music library.\n\nSong: A-","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"The proclaimed future of modern pop has struck again, and this time it isn't the instant sensation that was \"Bleeding Love\" nor is it the inspirational ballad of \"Footprints In The Sand.\" Nope, instead she gives us some background music, which may sound in with the times, but comes off as little more than a smooth radio-friendly sap fest.\n\nMusically, you can tell from the review title that the new Mariah is clearly musical fan of the old Mariah. But the not-so deep point here is that it could basically be sung by pop goddess, which doesn't differentiate this song from the rest of the competition.\n\nSo if you love Leona, love modern music, love smooth pop\/R&B tunes, and love \"safe\" music, than welcome to the party. But it holds little more than background music for me, because it doesn't really doesn't try to be anything more. Like some countries in the Olympics, some are just satisfied with OK.

The version of the album I have actually has 22 songs because I bought it initially off Itunes  to get the two itunes exclusive tracks. I then came back on here and found out there were five more Amazon exclusive tracks. There is not a bad song here. Lacey's voice never ceases to amaze me. Also, the lyrics on this record are awesome. I like the musical style too. I know that the overtly Christian lyrics my be a bit of a turn off to some of the band's non-Christian fans, they are the opposite for me. I love my savior Jesus Christ, and what he has done for me, and I love how Flyleaf expresses that they feel the same way. Give this record a try.

{"text":"This album is a set of mellow cover songs, mostly from the 80's. Springfield's cover versions are somewhat bland and vary little from the originals. It's a bit disappointing that Springfield doesn't attempt to update these songs (to avoid some dated 80's elements) or add any new twists on these songs. A re-imagining or unique spin on these songs would be expected, as that is traditionally the point of a covers album.\n\nThat being said, the songs sound nice and it's interesting to hear his vocals on these songs. You'll be able to sing along to every song from the start, since nothing about these arrangements differ from their original versions.\n\nIf you're a die-hard Springfield fan, it's worth purchasing just to hear his vocals on these songs. But don't expect any breakthroughs. Honestly, this album either feels like a \"filler\" album (to meet contractual requirements) or an attempt to recapture 80's-era fans (i.e. the \"Jessie's Girl\" crowd) who were were turned off by the grungy Shock\/Anger\/Denial\/Acceptance album that proceeded this.  If you're more a fan of Springfield's work from Tao or Karma, you might be a bit disappointed in this album for its lack of creativity or anything that reflects Springfield's unique pop\/rock style. But if you just enjoy his voice, this is a pleasant trip through the 80's.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Marilyn Manson has been popular for 20+ years now. I'm sure many bands wish they could last that long. This album is as good as all the other Manson albums, with the possible exception of the trilogy of \"Antichrist Superstar\", \"Mechanical Animals\" and \"Holy Wood\". Those who thought \"Mechanical Animals\" leaned too far into the mainstream might feel that way about this one too. Yes, it is tight, structured and pretty thoroughly produced. Not surprising, because most long-term artists take this route later in their careers anyway. But it has all the elements I want and expect from a Marilyn Manson album - loudness, dissonance, dark atmosphere, desperation, and religious and literary allusions. The sound engineering is clean and the music is well executed. There is excellent and varied guitar work throughout. The vocals, to me, sound as good as those on any other Manson album.\n\nI like the entire album, but some details stand out. \"Killing Strangers\", \"Birds Of Hell Awaiting\" and \"Odds Of Even\" are nice and bluesy. \"Odds Of Even\" in particular sounds like a Led Zeppelin epic, and in \"Birds Of Hell\" I like the amorphous quality caused by the constant echoing vocals. \"Deep Six\" develops into a screaming rock track, and it contains one of the two best lines on the album: \"You wanna know what Zeus said to Narcissus? You better watch yourself.\" \"Slave Only Dreams To Be King\", \"The Devil Beneath My Feet\" and \"Cupid Carries A Gun\" are all characterized by constant heavy pounding of the drums, and \"The Devil Beneath My Feet\" has my other favorite line: \"It's better to be blamed for robbing Peter than guilty for paying Paul.\" And, is that a piano I hear at the beginning of \"Cupid\"? Whatever, it is a nice touch.\n\nThe 3 bonus tracks are stripped-down, \"unplugged\" versions of \"Third Day Of A Seven Day Binge\", \"Mephistopheles of Los Angeles\" and \"Odds Of Even\", respectively. They are smooth as Manson tracks go, and interesting just by virtue of being different, sounding like classic singer\/songwriter tracks.","classification":5,"fold":0}

Regarded as Cher's disco album, once the single \"Believe\" was released to radio stations, DJ's couldn't get it on the radio fast enough due to the many requests by listeners. \"Believe\" was also a huge dance single ultimately winning Cher the Grammy for Best Dance recording. The \"Believe\" album was certified Quadruple Platinum meaning it had sold four million copies in the United States. The record would ultimately sell 20,000,000 copies worldwide becoming Cher's highest selling album in her remarkable career.\n\n \"Believe\" has really held up well over the last twelve years since its initial release. The songs are not dated which proves that the material Cher chose for this project was impeccably worked on by both the artist and her producers.\n\n The title single would stay at #1 for an amazing four week run.

After all, she was the one whom whipped Justin Beiber's moptop when she won Best New Artist at the Grammys this past year.

I was pleasantly surprised, especially with her smooth blended style, added with the intimacy of hearing the voice of Billie saying how she grew up out of slavery, and made only a grand a week.

I really like their older albums like Learning to Breathe, Legend of Chin and New Way to Be Human so was excited when I heard the singles for Where The Light Shines Through. This is Switchfoot going back to their early roots and a softer sound then what they did in Beautiful Letdown, Nothing is Sound, and Oh! Gravity which was a louder rock sound. I liked the Deluxe Edition as mine came with two bonus songs that are from the Switchfoot vault. Plus mine cane with an autograph which was cool as a collectors item. Overall great album if you like the earlier albums of Switchfoot.

But, there are those few songs that honestly just aren't some of her best works. Her latest single is no acception to that rule.

The song does follow Mariah's vocals nicely, but I just wasn't completely impressed. It just didn't seem to blow me away like the songs from her last record, The Emancipation Of Mimi did.

{"text":"JI throws a curve with the first song which is pure \"new traditionalist\" Country that would have fit well with his old band Drive By Truckers.  The rest of the album sounds nothing like that.  I guess this is called alt-country because there seems to be a need to place artists into boxes, but the sound is more along the lines of Neil Young, the Jayhawks, maybe a little John Prine - and all Jason Isbell.  In any case, the melodies are gorgeous throughout, but what really stands out are the outstanding lyrics, the best I've heard in a long time.  JI is a real story teller with lyrics that make you sit up and listen, supported by music and arrangements that reward repeated listenings.  I consider this to be one of the very finest releases of 2015.\nIt's difficult to pick favorites because the album is so solidly excellent throughout.

{"text":"Tantric's sophomore effort is pure brilliance.  After hearing seeing them live, I immediately went out and bought their self-titled debut and every SECOND of the album was up to pitch, fantastic rock music.  So when I heard they were coming out with another album, I was ecstatic.  Though this album is a little more 'hard' then their first CD, it's still amazing and those acoustics made famous by Todd are still there.  Their first single 'Hey Now' is actually more like their old stuff.  My favourite song on the CD would have to be 'Hero', a brilliant done song.  'The Chain' is a Fleetwood Mac remake, the beginning doesn't really sound like Tantric but once it gets to the chorus, you can hear their signature sound.  From start to finish this album delivers and I cannot WAIT to hear more.  If you liked the first album from Days of the New, Tantric's first CD or just love rock music you won't be disappointed with this.\n\nThat was my review after the first week of having the CD, now I have a little more to say.  Tantric's 'After We Go' is a timeless album, it hasn't left my CD player since it's release.  It's one of those albums that you can put on replay for the rest of your LIFE and still want to hear more.  Each track is amazingly good, it's like a big juicy apple pie, rich and delicious.  The opener, 'Chasing After' is a fast paced starter, Hugo's vocals are extremely well done here, lyrically good as well.  'After We Go' is one of my favourites (tied with about 5 others), the background vocals surpass Hugo's...strange, no.  The talent of this band is overflowing.  'Falling Away' is musically, one of the best songs I've heard.  The guitar work is actually intelligent.  The first single 'Hey Now' is a single I actually love to listen to.  'Hero' which was my favourite song when I first got the CD has now dropped a fair bit, it's still brilliant - a somewhat sweet anthem, if that is an apology, I accept.  'The Chain' is a Fleetwood Mac cover, very well done of the classic, the chorus is hard edged, I love Hugo's vocals on the 'and if you don't love me now, you will never love me again', chills.  'Change The World' is a great song to start off if you're a new Tantric fan, it's not as experimental, still extremely well done.  'Just Once' is my favourite song, I think when I listen to it, I go into a different world, the guitars and vocals put me into this dream and I never want to wake up.  These last few songs are what I call the creme de la creme, the best damn music I've ever heard in a long time!  All of these are tied with 'After We Go' for my favourite after 'Just Once' - that didn't really make sense.  In any case, 'Relentless' is lyrically amazing, Hugo's vocals are sexy as hell.  'Alright' - what can I say, the chorus ... if you're a woman, you will get caught up in the vocals, I am telling you, there is nothing sexier than Hugo's vocals.  Todd - you are a god.  Always will be.  'Before' really, there isn't much more I can say ... if I had a thesaurus close by I would look up some more incredible words to describe it's brilliance.  Lastly, 'Awake', a great closing song but every time I get there I wish there was more.  I hit repeat for the time being and I am counting down the days for the next album!!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"A reissue of an earlier release by the Billboard-charting New Age duo 2002, this CD, like their new album Damayanti, is a wondrous collection of some of the most breathtaking, exquisitely beautiful music ever recorded.\n\nHusband-and-wife Randy and Pamela Copus have hit on a winning formula, combining Randy's guitars and Pamela's flute and harp along with keyboards and synthesizers to create a hypnotic sound that mesmerizes and enthralls. It's no wonder that they consistently chart on Billboard - they have clearly connected with their audience by continually delivering pleasing melodies and luxurious arrangements.\n\nHaving recently reviewed Damayanti and now Deep Still Blue, I have noticed that 2002 has developed a consistent style that comprises deliberate, measured pacing. I haven't heard a 2002 song so far that's faster than mid-tempo. Each track takes its time, unfolding at its own leisure, allowing the listener to bask in all of its rich sonic intricacies. This is a refreshing change of pace from most albums of any genre, where tunes careen from one style to another, sometimes to jarring effect. Instead, 2002 stays true to its particular style or theme and is all the more successful for it.\n\nThis consistency of methodology is a major reason why Randy Copus is quickly becoming my favorite, strictly-New Age guitarist. Rather than a flashy display of virtuosity, his lead- and rhythm-guitar playing is as deliberate and measured as the expansive songs themselves. Each note he picks delivers precise and maximum impact, and his chords are as comforting as floating clouds. This is masterful technique in itself. The full effect of Randy's approach can be heard on such stunning tracks as \"An Ocean Apart,\" \"Little Angel,\" and \"The Voyage Home.\"\n\nPamela Copus is equally impressive in her subtle flute and harp playing. I'm not a flute and harp fan, but she makes it very accessible and enjoyable. Again, like Randy, her musical goal with her instruments is not to dazzle but to help paint a vivid, sonic portrait. Sometimes the flute trades lines with the guitar and other times it harmonizes with it, while the harp provides unobtrusive, decorative fills here and there. The result is a sound that is very cinematic.\n\nVocals also play a part in the proceedings, although not in the traditional sense. For the most part, the occasional vocals are wordless (\"vocalese\") and are very angelic and choir-like. The title track has actual lyrics written by Randy and Pamela's daughter Sarah and has an entrancing, hypnotic sound that I can only describe as New Age hippie folk, and I mean that in a good way.\n\nDeep Still Blue is another gem in 2002's stellar catalogue, and as \"Flight of the Swan\" is to Damayanti, \"An Ocean Apart\" is the jewel in the crown here - although the entire album is a delight from start to finish. Deep Still Blue and Damayanti are definitely two of my desert island picks.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I am perplexed at the stellar reviews 'Extended Play' has been getting in the press.  If you read them, they are almost word for word the same, so someone's doing a killer job with their PR.  It's as if no one dares to speak badly about elder statesmen.  And so those who assume I'm a fair-weather fan, I've purchased everything the band and solo artists have put out since 1973.\n\nI'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious about their four song Ep.  What had a ten year absence brought (after a 16 year one before that)?  Well, not much - that's for sure.\n\nFirst off, any Fleetwood Mac album since 1987 has been a result of Lindsey Buckingham's solo work being taken and morphed into a Fleetwood Mac album - and it always shows.  'Extended Play' is no different.\n\nThree of the four are Buckingham tunes - and iffy ones at that.  The one Stevie Nicks song is from 1973 - which isn't a shock. Almost all her material for the last 25 years has been pulled songs she wrote in the '70s.  If they weren't good enough to record then.......guess what?\n\nLet's start with her \"Without You\".  Cat Stevens should sue for plagiarism.  The music and arrangement has \"Peace Train\" written all over it.  (and enough with finding these songs on YouTube, which she did on her last solo disk, and from a woman who claims not to own or use a computer.)\n\nThe criticism of Nicks' voice back in the '70s was somewhat unwarranted, but like a prophecy waiting to be fulfilled, she lived up to it long ago.\n\nNicks' voice has been shot since the late '80's and for the life of me, the people who trip over themselves to sing (ha!) her praises is beyond me. The woman can no longer sing more than three notes and it is painful to listen to - mostly due to the nostalgia I'm feeling of what used to be.  Her vocal limits can work when songs and vocals are arranged correctly. But I can think of a few instances in the last 20 years where that has worked. It didn't hurt that the harmony vocals helped save those few songs.  For this outing, the harmonies are barely there....and they're all hers.\n\nBuckingham's \"Sad Angel\" is just half right. It's sad.  I don't know it would have even worked as a solo song, but it doesn't pass muster as a band one.  And speaking of solo stuff, his \"It Takes Time\" is just that.  Seriously, if you're going to do a group record, then a song with just you and a piano isn't the one to present in this venue. Save it for your solo work.\n\nThe only song that pseudo-works is the horribly titled \"Miss Fantasy\".  Buckingham writes notes he can't possibly hit - and doesn't - but doesn't jigger the vocal arrangement.  It is here that Nick's muted harmony on the chorus actually (almost) saves the song.\n\nWhat is sadder than the actual release is the band's assertion that this is some of their best work.  Yikes.\n\nI get that they're 63 years old and up, but has their hearing gone too?\n\nI'm not sure whether to blame Buckingham or co-producer Mitchell Froom.  Froom was a wiz with Crowded House, Forest for the Trees and Suzanne Vega.  But he bombs out here.  Or maybe this is the best he could do with which he had to work.\n\nI expect more from a band like this and not be expected to take with gratitude anything they push our way once every decade. They don't just get a pass. Either way - skip it.  Save yourself $3.98.","classification":1,"fold":0}

{"text":"Alison Sudol, aka A Fine Frenzy, has always gone for lyrical depth with her music, but she takes it to another level on Pines.  I won't repeat what you can read here on the product page, but she lost me this time.  In part because the concept is a bit obtuse, but the music does little to support her narrative.  No, it further obfuscates the story with long instrumental interludes that are all over the place in style.  The first two songs place heavy emphasis on acoustic guitar and folk style to the extent that they sound more like they belong on Lisa Hannigan's (Note: There's nothing wrong with Lisa Hannigan.  However, if I want that sound, I'll queue up Lisa Hannigan instead.) first album than something from A Fine Frenzy.  It's not just the instrumentation on these songs, but it is also Sudol's vocal delivery.  It goes between whisper\/spoken and grating falsetto with too much vibrato.  It's not until \"Avalanches (Culla's Song)\" that longtime fans will find something that sounds like what they are expecting.  The only other songs that resemble A Fine Frenzy's sound are \"Sailingsong\" and \"Now Is The Start\".  However, it would be inaccurate to say that this is all there is to Pines - but not necessarily in a good way.  If you fancy generic dance pop, then look no further than \"It's Alive\".  That is an ironic way to arrive at saying that Pines is the musical equivalent of Frankenstein's monster.  While it was intended to be high concept, it comes off as a collection of ill-fitting random parts.  If you want good music from A Fine Frenzy, grab One Cell in the Sea and Bomb in a Birdcage if you don't have them.  If you are curious about the folk songs, try Lisa Hannigan's See Sew.  But whatever you do, pass on Pines.","classification":2,"fold":0}

Adam must have sold out or been pressured into recording this generic sounding pop music that everyone is releasing these days.

{"text":"At a time when soldiers were viewed by many as anti-American and were being degraded for fighting in Viet Nam; SSgt. Barry Sadler, US Army, Green Beret, recorded this immortal song and injected a feeling of patriotism into an America divided by many issues. The 'Great Society' envisioned by LBJ was just a mirage in the distance that could never be reached as white and black Americans tried to come to terms with centuries of injustice and factions of Americans turned to drugs and isolation and created a counter-culture in an effort to escape governmental control. The war in Viet Nam was an ever-escalating affair that was not going the way it was suposed to go and was causing no end of discontent among American citizens who longed for peace. The President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, had been assasinated a few years earlier ending any chance we had for a revival of 'Camelot', an event that was soon to be repeated by the murders of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and John's younger brother Bobby. There were riots in the streets of most of America's major cities as black Americans, tired of being referred to as 'Africans' and other less savory titles, angrily demanded recognition and acceptance as Americans by their white counterparts. Draftees returning from duty in Viet Nam found themselves targets of tomato-throwers as if they had done some grievous misdeed by following orders. In the midst of all this was heard the steady voice of SSgt. Sadler. Suddenly, if only temporarily, our sight was focused on the bravery and unselfishness of our military members and we felt a rush of pride as we listened. Here was a song that was not about drugs...not about sex...not about money...it was a song about Americans, both black and white, who were ready to give their all for the rest of us. For a moment we forgot about the troubles...forgot about the turmoil...forgot about our differences...and remembered our heritage. For a moment we were in Camelot...and the Great Society was real.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"On this cover of All of the Stars, Jackie Evancho's voice is drop dead gorgeous, even though she employs a much less classical voice than usual. To me, she has given this song a far more approachable treatment. She starts out in a pensive voice in her lower register, then she works her way up. She also sings her own harmony track, which is a clever addition to her styling.\n\nPeople who view the video of this song might feel Jackie has re-purposed this song into an anthem for a topic that has been getting some recent play, but until now, nowhere nearly as sensitively as her voice does. She has done this sort of thing in the past. She sang My Heart Will Go on from Titanic on the 2014 PBS Memorial Day Concert on the Mall in Washington D. C. In the process, her treatment of that song transformed it from one woman's private love and loss into an anthem of tragedy, heartbreak and healing for an entire country. Nobody can do this as well as she can, and she does it yet again with All of the Stars.\n\nI am very impressed with what she has accomplished in her short life. This adds to that. Big time.","classification":5,"fold":0}

The song takes on too much of the feeling of Madonna's Express Yourself, with a pinch of Vogue. I really wasn't even impressed with the song at all. It really feels like she is trying too hard to be into the sexual appeal Madonna had shown for over 25 years, than being herself.

None other could get between the two, the sincerity he displayed in his words was what got me to stay and listen.\n\nIf my mom wasn't sleeping she might have looked at me a bit funny.

Unfortunately, most of the covers in the past several years have been jokes and not really as classy as the original songs have been. The past several years for R&B have been more of the overexposure of acts like Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles. But for classic songs, they haven't really been shown the compassion and care that had been drove like songs did years ago. For Will Downing, he has been one of those R&B singers, known more for his concerts than even having a glance on the radio. But when he has sung a song, it is worth listening to. His cover of Cherelle & Alexander O' Neal's song Everything I Miss At Home definitely is a bright light, in a industry that has been more about flaunting the outers than the inner voice itself. It is a nice cover, and definitely ranks into the few that have been worth listening to the past few years like Musiq Soulchild's version of Maze's Silky Soul in 2010.

{"text":"LIVE TO WIN\nPaul Stanley\n\nTwenty-Eight years after his first solo album release, Paul Stanley of the rock God's of Thunder, KISS, proves yet again that he can deliver.  His unmistakable powerhouse voice doesn't sound a day older than it did in 1976, when Destroyer came out, forever changing my eleven year old life.  With the anticipation of a school girl, I went out and bought \"Live to Win\" and brought it home, not opening it.  I set it in a place of honor and in plain sight, but I couldn't bring my self to open it...not yet.  I was hesitant and anxious all at the same time about listening to the CD, I felt like a friend or a lover, almost protective, I was in his corner cheering for him to do great even if he didn't quite pull it off.  It took me two days of mental preparation after buying it to carefully unwrap it and pop it in for a listen.  I selected random, turned up the volume, pushed play and held my breath.  The first song chosen was \"Where Angels Dare\" and hallelujah, I was eleven again.  The hair stood up on the back of my neck, excitement ran through my body and I was again newly in love with Paul.  The lyrics are poignant and say everything I was feeling for the never aging Rock Star before I ever opened the CD.  \"They say it's over, but I have just begun to fight\", honey it is definitely NOT over!  Forgive me Paul, I should of trusted you and known better.  This 10 track CD doesn't disappoint this Paul Stanley fan, not in the least.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"There are a certain group of folk who expect the PSB's to bring out only stomping disco bangers, a la the recent Electric, and Very. Yes, they do those brilliantly, but they also do the gentler stuff extremely well (many PSB fans consider 'Behavior' to be their finest album, including myself). This time, the boys work with Kanye West producer Andrew Dawson and come up with this rather beautiful album. This was originally going to be called 'Happy Sad' which would have suited the music perfectly, but the eventual title also fits well.\nIn my opinion, the album is a bit of a mixed bag, but doesn't deserve some of the less favorable reviews it got. Here's a fairly short run-through of the tracks:\n\nLeaving - Nice opening song that sets the tone of the album. Seems to be about death. Chugs along nicely, with a lovely chorus.\nInvisible - Love this song. The lyrics seem to be about an older guy who now feels invisible when he goes out. Quite relatable! It's accompanied by extremely minimal and really beautiful music. A standout for me.\nWinner - I'm not going to lie. This is a generic pop song that seemed to be written to cash in on the London Olympics. However, the boys say it was actually written with the Eurovision song contest in mind. I really don't like this, the boys have done so much better.\nYour Early Stuff - Pretty much a bunch of quotes that Neil has heard about the PSB's while in taxi's and the like. Really quite a funny and well-produced track.\nA Face Like That - An odd, but good inclusion. This sounds very much like the 'Please' era PSB's and sounds great.\nBreathing Space - Probably my favorite track. Really strong lyrics about taking a step back when things get too much, and yet another beautiful melody.\nEgo Music - Not really for me, the faintly electro sounding music is pretty good, but the lyrics, nah!\nHold On - Set to a backing of Handel, this choir enhanced track is pretty nice.\nGive It a Go - Lot's of PSB fans hated this, but I don't think it's too bad. A little 3 minute pop song about love.\nMemory of the Future - Not THIS could have been a Eurovision entry. It's OK, but doesn't really have the wit and charm of a classic PSB track for me.\nEverything Means Something - The track I always skip!\nRequiem in Denim and Leopardskin - A fantastic closer. Keeps the gentle feel of the rest of the album, but adds some disco stylings and great lyrics. Wonderful driving music!\n\nSo if you're a PSB fan, you already have this. If you are not, this is not the best introduction to boys music (I'd say 'PopArt' is that), but it's a wonderful (mostly) album that you might grow to love like I did.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Silver-toned Ed Brown's 50 year news reporting career included stints at WMCA-570 AM and WNEW-1130 AM in NYC and for the RKO and NBC radio networks. He retired in 1997 after some years at WCHL-1360, in Chapel Hill, NC.\n\nFounded in 1925 as a 5,000 watt station at the top of the AM dial, by 1960 WMCA adopted their successful \"Good Guys\" Top 40 format. Despite competition from 50,000 watt clear channel WABC-770, 'MCA was NYC's ratings champ from 1963 through '66. By 1970, they transitioned to an all talk format called \"Dial-Log Radio.\"\n\nNYC's PREMIER ALBUMS was founded in 1959 as a budget operation with such labels as CORONET and SPIN-O-RAMA. In 1965, Premier bought out Philly-based CAMEO\/PARKWAY. Their JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY - A MEMORIAL ALBUM (#2099) is fine-quality: a substantial disc with good audio. The record reproduces in full a one-hour show narrated by Brown and broadcast over WMCA on the day of JFK's murder, 11\/22\/63. All but two speeches selected are excerpts.\n\nThe LP's back cover has the memorial service eulogy given by Cardinal Richard Cushing of Massachusetts, and the lying in state remarks of House Speaker John McCormack (of Boston), Chief Justice Earl Warren (former Gov. of CA.) and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (of MT.). Mansfield's comments were briefest, but also the most moving:\n\n\"There was a sound of laughter; in a moment, it\nwas no more. And so she took a ring from her finger\nand placed it in his hands.\nThere was a husband who asked much and gave much,\nand out of the giving and the asking wove with a\nwoman what could not be broken in life, and in a\nmoment it was no more. And so she took a ring from\nher finger and placed it in his hands, and kissed him\nand closed the lid of a coffin.\nA piece of each of us died at that moment. Yet, in\ndeath he gave of himself to us. He gave us of a good\nheart from which the laughter came. He gave us of a\nprofound wit, from which a great leadership emerged.\"\n\nSIDE ONE\n[21:20] Oath of Office (1\/20\/61); Campaign speech on being Catholic; \"New Frontier\" acceptance speech, 1960  Democratic Convention, L.A.; First Nixon-Kennedy Debate; Inaugural Address, unedited (1\/20\/61)\n\nSIDE TWO\n[27:10] West Berlin and the dangers of Communism's expansion (Alliance For Progress); U.S. Steel price increases (spring '62); Cuban Missile Crisis TV speech, conclusion (Oct.

{"text":"British soul singer Corinne Bailey Rae didn't always have dreams of doing rhythm and blues. Her first foray into music was being the lead singer of an all-female alt-rock band named Helen - a band modeled after the American female rockers L7. Although largely ignored by labels in their hometown, they were offered a recording contract with American hard rock\/heavy metal label Roadrunner Records in the late 90's. Before they could sign the contract, the bass player of the group became pregnant, which caused the group to disband. Figuring out what to do next, she decided to ditch rock music for soul music and made guest appearances on albums by other London acts. One of those collaborations led her to a recording contract with EMI Records UK, which resulted in her 2006 self titled debut. The album delivered hit singles such as \"Like A Star\" as well as \"Put Your Records On\", which brought her fame in England as well as the United States. In the middle of recording her next album, she got the news that her husband Jason Rae had died of a drug overdose. The incident would later cause her to delay and shift the direction of the album, which became her 2010 sophomore set \"The Sea\". 2012 saw Corinne record the ballad \"Chains\" for the Quentin Tarantino executive produced RZA film \"The Man With The Iron Fists\". Also in that same year, she experienced yet another setback - this time, due to issues surrounding her record label. Due to corporate restructuring, Corinne was moved from EMI to its sister label Virgin Records. She was delayed even further due to Virgin getting a new CEO in the form of former A&M and Geffen executive Ron Fair.\n\nShe set about recording a new album, only this time, her longtime producers suggested that she record in Los Angeles. Initially hesitant of the move, she ended up recording with the likes of Valerie Simpson, Esperanza Spalding, Marcus Miller, \"Black Messiah\"'s session musicians Isaiah Starkey and James Gadson and lastly, KING members Amber and Paris Strother. Those collaborations would end up on Corinne's first album in six years \"The Heart Speaks In Whispers\".  On her new album, she takes on an sound that's very reminiscent of the R&B music scene of the mid to late 80's. She opens the album with the optimistic \"The Skies Will Break\" and decides to give a lover a second chance on the acoustic ballad \"Hey, I Won't Break Your Heart\". She reflects on a romance's perfect timing on \"I've Been To The Moon\" and brings a club sound to the romantic atmosphere on \"Tell Me\". She  uses nature as a romantic setting on the first single \"Green Aphrodisiac\" and gets sensual on \"Horse Print Dress\". On the ballad  \"Do You Think Of Me\", she laments over having to be in a long distance relationship. She hopes for a long lasting love on \"Taken By Dreams\", while closing the album with \"Night\". \"The Heart Speaks In Whispers\" is another great recording from Corinne Bailey Rae. Despite the numerous setbacks she's faced over the years, it hasn't put a damper on her music - or her career. Although it's been a minute that she's released an album, she shows that she hasn't lost a step.","classification":5,"fold":0}

THEN, I heard she wrote some songs on the 1st album, and that on this new one, she wrote pretty much the whole thing, and I heard that it was pretty authentic.  A friend of mine who buys country, preferably the alternative singer\/songwriter kind, praised this and said I'd like it.  Then I see it debuted really high in Billboard...#10 pop and higher in country, like #3 or even #1...so I kept it in mind.\n\nSo I'm at Target, and I can't keep my eyes off this thing...she is one FINE-looking woman...and I don't buy just because someone looks good, but from multiple sources, I hear she has the talent behind the looks, and Target's version has not 1 or 2, but FOUR bonus tracks and always $9.99, so I caved...and glad I did...will have to get album #1 as well.  Vocally, she doesn't sound like how she looks AT ALL...which you think Shania Twain or very girly...nope...she's raw and raspy, more like Miranda Lambert than anyone else...BUT she has this powerpop sensibility that reminds me of Sara Evans as well, with a similar character quality...opening track \"Boomerang\" reminds me of Sara's \"Coalmine\" off her 2005 album \"Real Fine Place\".  Heard the album once, and I can tell, it's from Jana's soul and heart...blood and guts...but there is a catchiness to it as well...a tiny bit of sugar to make the bitter pill go down easier.\n\nWill delve deeper with repeated listens, but whatta first impression!!

{"text":"The country music genre has changed a lot over the years.  I grew up with my dad playing guys like Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard and Johnny Paycheck.  While the new breed of country stars you hear on the radio are mainly pop-country at best and have very little to do with those other guys I mentioned, Chris Knight is the real deal.  His songs are about real people living real lives and he's often downright pissed off at the way the government is interfering with our lives.\n\nLittle Victories is a damn good record that is somewhere between the acoustic discs \"Trailer Tapes\" and \"Trailer II\" that Knight has released and the hard rocking \"Enough Rope.\"  The songs on this record just ring true to me and are better than anything you'll find on country radio.\n\nThe bottom line is I'd highly recommend any of Chris Knight's albums to anyone that likes real, gritty country music.  If you're into that pop stuff you'll probably want to pass.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"It has been a very long time since Maxwell made a impact with making deep music. When he released his 2009 album Blacksummers' Night, it came at a time when we were going through a tragic death in the world, with the loss of Michael Jackson. His work coming back in the music industry, after a seven year wait has been more of a shocker, but honestly it has been worth it. Especially when the R&B music industry has been more diluted with overexposed artists like Beyonce; Knowles and Rihanna that have made it more like it is garbage than brilliance. But for Maxwell, when he does a good song, it is worth listening to. Even if it is a surprising sample that is better than what radio sounds like today. 1990x, the second single from Maxwell's 2016 album, black Summers' Night is very soulful and intimate from his sensual and sophisticated voice. The song also takes on a Michael Jackson sample of his lesser-known song Heaven Can Wait from 2001's Invincible brilliantly. Maxwell really samples the song very well, and takes it more in a soulful simplistic direction. I was honestly very impressed, because it sounds better than the weights Jackson made for his song to sound like from years ago were not as brilliant as Maxwell makes of his washed-up song to a tune that meets Maxwell's heart so nicely. This is a real treat for die hard Maxwell fans, and for anyone that never heard his music before.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Back To Black by Amy Winehouse features her talents as a professional singer, songwriter and guitar player. She even provides her own background vocals on some of these tracks! I'm impressed. Amy certainly has her personal demons; but she does an incredible job performing the songs on this CD. The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is beautifully done. The liner notes include the song lyrics as well as the credits.\n\nThe album begins with Amy singing her heart out on \"Rehab.\" She sings of a woman, probably based in part on her own experiences, who is not exactly eager to go to a rehabilitation center as a way to get better. The musical arrangement has a strong percussion element that supplies the foundation for the music; the guitar and brass work well for \"Rehab\" to create a lush musical arrangement. Nevertheless, this arrangement never steals the spotlight away from Amy's vocals; and \"Rehab\" is a powerful, catchy and memorable number. \"You Know I'm No Good\" starts off with what sounds like a rap or hip hop musical intro; but when the music goes into the main portion of the song you get that `60s style arrangement Amy does so well. Amy sings this without a superfluous note and she never falters. \"You Know I'm No Good\" explores complicated, painful love relationships and Amy delivers this like a champ! In addition, I really like \"Just Friends;\" Amy sings this wearing her heart on her sleeve. Her excellent diction enhances her performance even more and again the music fits in perfectly with her singing.\n\n\"Back To Black,\" the title track for this album, reminds me of a tune The Supremes might have released in their time. Amy delivers this without a hitch and that's grand. \"Back To Black\" deals with the pain that can come with the ending of a love affair; and \"Back To Black\" is obviously a major highlight of this album. \"Love Is A Losing Game\" is another tune that explores the painful end of a love affair. \"Love Is A Losing Game\" also has a somewhat mellow, old school vibe arrangement to accompany Amy as she sings this to perfection and beyond! \"Wake Up Alone\" has complex key modulations but Amy handles this like the pro she is and always will be! \"Wake Up Alone\" stuns me with its beauty even though it's not the happiest of songs; Amy Winehouse does a great job on \"Wake Up Alone.\"\n\n\"Some Unholy War\" has Amy singing, playing guitar and providing her own backup vocals. \"Some Unholy War\" has Amy squarely in the spotlight--right where she belongs! Although the track set appears to end with \"He Can Only Hold Her,\" the CD has silence for about 20 seconds before we are treated to a remix of \"You Know I'm No Good.\" Excellent!\n\nBack To Black still sells well years after its release; and this proves just how wonderful the music is on this album. This CD is a \"must-have\" for Amy's fans; and people just discovering Amy would do well to start with this album. In addition, people who enjoy songs with a retro soul flavor to them will not be disappointed.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Alanis Morissette gets into the carpet where most generic brands of vacuum do not. \"Under Rug Swept\" is the third testament to Morissette's capable songwriting abilities. Look between the fibers of \"Flinch\" and \"Hands Clean\" (according to Morissette it's told from the other person's point of view, which few songwriter's even think about trying). While the penmanship is poignant, the music fails to capture the immediacy of 1995's \"Jagged Little Pill\". This is, after all, Morissette's third cd for a major label, and haven't we been here before? The musical riffs fit like a well trodden carpet, and it could be said that musical experimentation isn't one of Alanis's strong points. Yet, the music here is entertaining like the old fashioned chorus of \"Narcissus\" or the trance beats of \"Surrendering\". The one thing fans will take with them is Morissette's heartfelt lyrics. This is the grit in the carpet that will continue to draw crowds. Few musicians covet their shag carpeting, often choosing stain resistant approaches to music and lyrics. \"Under Rug Swept\" is as durable as an old shag alright, right down to the 70's-looking cd cover. Perhaps Morissette might consider working with a Peter Gabriel or fellow Canadian Robbie Robertson next time out. It might give new musical direction and keep fans glued to the floor.  Overall, no fleas from Morissette this time out, this one's a keeper.","classification":4,"fold":0}
{"text":"One of my favorite Christmas classics, and who doesn't love Dean Martin? I really enjoy mixing this song in with my holiday playlist, and it fits in well with other classics and a lot of new Christmas songs. Has a nice sound, a bit slow, but I still love to sing along and always smile when it reminds me how times have changed based on the phrases they used, that were ok years ago, But now used only by heavy metal bands, and some would be offended by the lyrics of staying to have a cigarette and a drink!! Haha, kind of amazing if you think about it......but I do love it and recommend this version to anyone looking for a favorite classic.","classification":5,"fold":0}

This collection contains several complete symphonies except for the unfinished 8th along with chamber music (Trout) and of course, lots of solo piano music.

I was at Best Buy a few weeks ago and they had his live DVD playing on one of the big screens and he actually does pretty good on live shows and I decided to pick up this CD since it was on sale and I couldn't find \"The Arrival\" by Kindred the Family Soul. I gave the CD a few listens and i got either a headache or real sleepy halfway through. What looked promising sounded deriative at best. his duet with Brandy was way less than I expected, the CD ran together and at the end of the week, after importing into iTunes, i just picked and choosed what to listen to and even after a few more days, i don't even listen to it and the CD has collected dust pretty much.

{"text":"As a child growing up in the projects of New Jersey, Jaheim Hoagland accumulated more emotional baggage than all of JFK international airport.  Having lost his father at two years old, he spent most of his childhood doing the street thug thing, getting into all sorts of petty trouble while being raised in a single-parent household.  But when his mother passed away when he was 17, the pain of his loss inspired him to aggressively pursue a recording career, and 4 years later his debut, \"Ghetto Love,\" was released.  To be certain, that record wasn't perfect, and it had its share of filler.  But what made it worth the trip was Jaheim's voice, which had me do double-takes to make sure I wasn't listening to a Teddy Pendegrass record.  On his superior, impressive second album, \"Still Ghetto,\" the flava is r&b with a dash of hip hop, but the influences are clearly rooted in the old school.  Throughout its trip of nearly an hour, \"Still Ghetto\" is honest, rugged, and soulful.  Thematically, it's not a huge departure from his debut, as the majority of the songs pertain to relationships and the drama that sometimes comes with them.  Mary J. Blige openly gave Jaheim props in a Rolling Stone article, and she appears in the impressive duet, \"Beauty and Thug,\" in which the Queen of Hip Hop Soul's bruised voice goes hand-in-hand with his husky voice.  He glides effortlessly through the ultrasmooth slow jam \"Long As I Live,\" and I don't even need to explain what the song \"Tight Jeans\" is about.  \"Still Ghetto\" is essentially the record Tank's \"One Man\" should have been.  The latter record suffered from tired beats and half-inspired singing, but on \"Still Ghetto,\" Jaheim pulls it off with flying colors.  He may be a little rough on the edges, and some may even question his choice of words (um, \"Me and My B----,\" anyone?), but there's no denying his honesty.  Some records keep it real, and others keep it right.  This record does both.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"\"Last Song,\" by Edward Bear, is another of the 1970's songs which are melancholy and wistful and sad. Released in 1972 (same year as Bread's \"Diary,\" a similar sad song), \"Last Song\" spent 18 weeks on the charts and peaked at number 3 on Billboard's Hot 100. This was Edward Bear's most successful song; it centers on the singer's realization that his love, gone now for two years, is not coming back despite his keeping the lights on, hoping and longing for that return. Now, however, he understands that will not happen and so he writes and sings this \"last song\" for her. The time has come to close that chapter of his life, despite his continuing love for her. It's time to turn out the lights. A gently-sung piece, \"Last Song\" is entirely reminiscent of the feeling of the soft-rock 70's.\n\nEdward Bear is not a person's name; it's actually a three-man band, named for Winnie the Pooh, whose actual name is Edward Bear. A Canadian group, Edward Bear started out in 1966, completely unknown and performed at events, birthday parties, bars -- eventually getting noticed almost by accident and signed by Capital Records. The members were Larry Evoy, architect\/keyboardist Paul Weldon, and guitarist Danny Marks. The band lasted twelve years all told. They produced four albums and four solid hits. At the end, there were apparently no conflicts or issues among the trio; they just decided they were through with this segment of their lives and wanted to do other things.\n\nIn 1995, Evoy received an award from the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada for \"Last Song\" (and two other pieces) having been played on-air 100,000 times. On soft-rock stations, \"Last Song\" is still played, 44 years after its initial release!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I avoided the EP releases from Pixies Phase II, but I could hold out no longer when I saw them collected as Indie Cindy. A longtime fan of both Pixies and Frank Black, I felt I had to open myself up to disappointment and give this a chance. It certainly helped that Frank Black's latest releases have been good, his music turning back toward his strengths. Teenager of the Year remains one of my favorite albums by any artist, and I of course love the entire run of the original Pixies, particularly Doolittle. Indie Cindy is a bit of a catch-all of the Pixies' strengths, even though the absence of Kim Deal is subtly felt. In a nutshell, this is what one would expect from a post-Trompe le Monde Pixies: hard, melodic, punchy, and sonically interesting.\n\nMost notably, Frank Black (I still think of him by that particular alias) sounds better than he has since Teenager of the Year. His vocals are just fantastic, the production giving just the right touch. Now that he's back with Santiago and Lovering, all the instruments have personality, so the dynamic is just right for these songs. In the end, this album not only doesn't diminish the band's legacy, it adds an exciting new chapter. Their peak years were of course their original run, but this isn't an exercise in nostalgia or a victory lap for an old band. It's a great batch of songs by artists in a new phase of their careers. I'm excited to see what they do next, but for now I'm thrilled to spend some time with Indie Cindy.","classification":4,"fold":0}

Enticed by a Metamorpho review, I decided to head down memory lane and pick up a jazzy and formidable piece of rock music.  \"The Wanderer\" gets my vote as the best Dion song, and, as I refuse to contradict the merits of Meta's illuminating review, I can still wait for tomorrow to pick up the other nuggets I've sampled of his on Amazon when I get extra greenbacks.\n\nNot to date myself, but it is quite a blessing to discover the glory of music in different phases:  a clock radio (childhood), a radio tape-recorder (puberty) to stereo and Walkman (college), and now the splendor and clarity of MP3 player resonance and selection.\n\n(For the uninitiated, TAKE NOTE:  Write down the directions as you initiate your downloading capabilities from Amazon.  Download the complimentary starter song they offer (You may say, \"I didn't order that!\" Notice it says \"Free Download\" to start your format.  Then, play the song from its selected option.  (See if your Windows Media Player  plays it and capture it in your library.)  When it does and you've captured it, you're in business. Then, you can download songs off Amazon.  (I would also advise you to listen to the songs before you download them.  Make sure you hear the version of the song you want. [I almost downloaded a new version of The Crystals' \"He's a Rebel,\" a no-no in my book.)\n\nBeing somewhere between a newbie and computer whiz kid, I admit it's a little hard to start on Amazon.  (I had to pay twice for Cyndi Lauper's \"All Through the Night\" before I got the hang of it.)  If you write down the directions, it is easy after your first download and capture.  So pay attention and \"Don't do as I do, do as I say!\"  Having the will and way, I am happy to take the Amazon MP3 Player plunge.  Give it a try and you will, too.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"When it has came down to Mariah Carey, her music at heart has been terrible and out of tune for quite awhile. It has been a very long while since she came out with new songs. The past few years set the motion of her music failing and more about her feuds between Nicki Minaj, and the decision of firing her as a judge on American Idol. Her latest set of songs, do fail to ignite on her new record Me... I Am Mariah: The Elusive Chanteuse. Thirsty, the next single from wasted album shows that Mariah still is missing the mark at heart and in voice as well. I really found the song to be even worse than even all the songs she had released from her last album, Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel. She definitely needs to find better in her voice, and her heart. Hopefully, there will be better from her to quench your thirst in her voice.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":0}

{"text":"Bizzle to me is hands down the best lyricist in Gospel rap now.  Every time he spits something it is very relevant. However, Bizzle didn't go as hard on this album as Wishing Wells.  A lil too much singing... had him sounding kind of \"50 Cent Like\" at times.  Also his subject matter on this album seemed to be only geared at one race. (My humble opinion.)  His popularity is growing at a vast rate.  I think its time he makes his music more universal to appeal to all his Christian brothers and sisters of different races.  This one seems a lil too urban.  Wishing wells seemed to have a more universal sound,.\n\nBizzle's lyrics are still very thought provoking... It just didn't stir me like his mixtape songs like the Same Love, his check on other secular artists who were disrespectful to our Savior.  Nonetheless Bizzle is my favorite and most prevalent Gospel Rap Artist right now... I'm just praying he digs deeper.  Cross the boundaries to other races in Christianity and dig deeper in Christ to get that deeper anointing to continue to impact the kingdom like he does.\n\nThis 3 star view is kind of harsh... but that's because Bizzle is my favorite Christian rap artist and I know what he's capable of consistently putting out. Thought provoking music for all nationalities in Christianity.  Nonetheless... this album is a keeper and Bizzle is the most insightful Christian rap artist out there.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"If ever there was a song that aspires to be something more, but leaves you feeling 'meh', this is it.  Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande are already big time, chart-topping talents.  Jessie J is getting close to that status (already scoring hits with \"Domino\" and \"Price Tag\").  \"Bang Bang\" is a song designed to bring three sexy powerful voices together for a sexy, raunchy tune.  It ends up being just an 'ok' song (more like a 2 1\/2 star song, rather than the 2 I'm giving it).\n\n  It's hard to quantify why \"Bang Bang\" doesn't deliver.  Though, in all likelihood, it is because the studio over-produced this track, which typically happens when multiple big talents are brought together.","classification":2,"fold":0}

{"text":"From Marvin Junior (The Dells) to Teddy Pendergrass...and now Jaheim...the torch keeps passing!  Although THIS CD displays his incredible voice and makes him a STAR...I'm saving my FIVE star review for his NEXT CD.  The next one SHOULD make him a SUPERSTAR...elevating him to the Luther and Teddy heights.\n\nI miss Teddy Pendergrass...the Teddy who sang with the Blue Notes and who later had some fantastic solo albums BEFORE the accident.  Where Luther had a touch of female in his phrasing (which made his voice incredible)...Teddy's voice was ALL testosterone, without apologies.  Forceful, direct and demanding, Teddy's singing reminded me of old Southern Negro field hollers.  All due respect to David Ruffin, Eddie Levert, Dennis Edwards...even Gerald Levert (excellent ALL)...but they're urban...they're missing that \"pig feet and hot sauce\".  Teddy had the quintescential southern black, arrogant, macho, R&B song voice...and during the 70's, I'm sure it made many white people (especially women) uncomfortable in various ways.\n\nJaheim has the same voice...the same approach.  What played well in the 70's...continues to play.  His \"ghetto-ness\" might turn some off...but I hope he doesn't completely drop that thug affect...yet.  It took 25 years...but the torch has been passed.  On his NEXT CD...I hope he pays a tribute to Teddy by remaking a song.\n\nYes...I'm ol' skool...and I thank you Jaheim...now pass the corn bread.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Remember back in 1996 when everyone came back to New Edition for their reunion album? Then Bobby Brown said he could make more money by himself, and everyone said he was coming off too cocky. Well, Johnny Gill released a new solo album at the same time New Edition's Home Again came out, so wasn't he being a little cocky himself? Yeah, everyone knows Johnny can do his thing solo, but to be honest, this wasn't his best album.\nTake the Babyface-penned title track, for example. The song sounds fine until you get to the chorus: \"Let's get the mood right\/Turn on your heart light.\" Turn on your heart light? That's too cheesy, even for Babyface. And \"Love In An Elevator\" is full of corny lyrics like \"They say there's no luck on the thirteenth floor\/But I found love and so much more\" and \"Like The Staples, I wanna take you there.\" \"Simply Say I Love You\" is okay, but the album said Stevie Wonder is featured in this song. Maybe it's just me, but I don't remember hearing Stevie in that song.\nThe only songs that really stand out are \"Maybe\" and \"It's Your Body\". The latter features Roger Troutman, and we all know that slow Roger Troutman songs are irresistible. The thing that really brings the other slow songs down is that they all talk about the same thing: sex, sex, and more sex. The sleepy production doesn't make things better, either.\nAnother problem on this album are the corny uptempo songs, especially the very last track, \"So Gentle\". It features a rap from Ron DeVoe, so you know what the main problem is. But the thing is that the preceding song \"I Know You Want Me\" features uninspired rapping from some other guy, and his rapping is actually worse than Ron's.\nI still like Johnny Gill, but this album seems like it was rushed. And the strong adlibs he's known for usually adds feeling to the songs, but here it seems like they're trying to hide the questionable material. You're better off getting the solo albums he made before this.","classification":3,"fold":0}

Like checking this boy's penis size in his pants.\n\nI don't know why but songs like this are a pass for me. Just don't expect to be blown away, lyrically.\n\n3.75 stars or a 7.5\/10.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Bob Dylan has long been known as a phenomenal songwriter, with varied opinions on how good of a singer he actually is. Numerous artists and bands have made huge names for themselves recording songs that Dylan wrote. The fun part here is that this is a cover album! So now it's Dylan singing other people's songs. It all feels very backwards. But it's his 37th studio album, so I guess he's earned the right to sit back and let other people do the songwriting for once.\n\nThe super ironic part is that he voice sounds better now than it ever did in his prime. This cover album works at times, and its just sort of there at other times. There's not really a bad track in the bunch. There are 2 songs I didn't love, but even those were okay. I think you have to go into this understanding that it's not a groundbreaking album that's going to change the world. (Bob Dylan has literally already done that. It's hard to pull a thing like that off twice). It's an old guy singing songs he personally loves because they mean something to him. Understanding that, I loved this album.\n\n Young At Heart - Okay at first it's just weird to hear Bob Dylan signing lounge music. It feels very out of place at first. But as you listen, you hear Dylan really nails it. Since he is in his golden years this song works perfectly for him. It ends up being a great version of a classic song.\n\n Maybe You'll Be There - Its' very soft and very mellow. It's very relaxing. This is one of those songs that just sort of there. It's nice, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to listen to it.\n\n Polka Dots and Moonbeams - This is so peaceful and relaxing it's almost therapeutic. The music is awesome. Dylan's singing it awesome. This one literally just put me in a better mood.\n\n All The Way - This song is all about loving someone to the fullest extent possible, because there's no point in holding back love. It's a GREAT song. That is such a wonderful message and a valuable lesson coming from an older person telling younger people a good way to grow old without having regrets that you didn't love hard enough. It's a beautiful song. It's got a slow rhythm and Dylan makes it sound like he's alone in a room signing only to you and the person you love....and that you should be slow dancing with each other while he sings.\n\n Skylark - More soothing wonderfulness. I am not familiar with the original on this one. But I like Dylan's version.\n\n Nevertheless - Again, Dylan makes you feel like he's signing this to you and only you. I don't know how he pulls that off but he does it on several tracks on this album and this is one of the better examples of it.\n\n All Or Nothing At All - This was one of my least favorite tracks on the album, but it's still decent. Like everything else here it's quiet and soothing. It's just the song never did anything for me. But music is a personal preference sort of thing so it might be someone else's favorite track ever and they wouldn't be wrong.\n\n On A Little Street In Singapore - This is a good story. Listen to the lyrics. It sounds great set to Dylan's raspy voice.\n\n It Had To Be You - Best track of the album. Hands down. And I went into this album thinking I was going to hate this because I absolutely love this song. (The Harry Connick Jr version played at my wedding) I wasn't sure Dylan could do this one justice. But he absolutely owns it. It's a very slow version of this all time classic and it works in every possible way.\n\n Melancholy Mood - Dylan has still got that raspy voice of the people sound, but it's more refined now. And his voice style is PERFECT for this song.\n\n That Old Black Magic - This one is soft, but fast. It's soothing but peppy. I don't know how those things mix, but it's happening on this track. This is one of the most fun songs on the album and Dylan's voice does it well. You can almost hear him dancing while singing.\n\n Come Rain or Come Shine - I didn't love this one. Again, it's not bad. It's just kind of 'there'. Nothing really comes together on this track. Dylan's voice doesn't work for the song. The music is almost too simple to be interesting. It's not a song I skipped at the end, but it wasn't super engaging me.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I read some of the negative reviews of India. Arie's Voyage to India album and I wonder if those reviewers listened to the whole album. Sure, she gets preachy at times on here, but that's only on two or three songs, and even those are good. And every time I listen to this album, I love it even more.\n\"Little Things\" is an okay song for a first single, but there are better songs than that on here. Check out the two highlights, \"Good Man\", where India tells a story about a man who tells his wife to remember him if he dies someday, and \"Talk to Her\" (which is still very preachy), where India tells men to respect their women. The latter, as well as a few other songs, features Laurnea, who's been M.I.A. from the industry for a while. Where did India find her??? Even as a backup singer, she shines like she always did.\n\"Can I Walk With You\" has that ready-for-VH1 feel to it, as does \"Interested\", but that doesn't make these songs any less engaging. Also, I noticed that \"Slow Down\" has the same melody as last year's \"Back to the Middle\". But this album is still solid. Don't buy it expecting some kind of growth in songwriting or spiritual evolution (it's only been a year since her Acoustic Soul album).

{"text":"Cake is a unique group to say the least, where the singer doesn't sing, he just talk to a rhythm and a beat. However, this arrangement and quirk works perfectly for them and their style. Can you imagine a song like this being sung by anybody else?\n\nThis song is about what girl the singer wants, and it's a rather long list, and like a child's Christmas list, it starts off general and reasonable, but by the end it gets very specific, \"She's changing her name\/From Kitty to Karen\/She's trading her MG\/For a white Chrysler LeBaron\/I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket.\" And when the song gets to the Na Na Na Na Na part, then you're instantly hooked, dancing, and singing. This song is amazingly catchy, and brilliant. You won't hear lyrics like these from Beyonce, or anybody else, except for Weird Al.\n\nOverall, a great song that shine with its subtle poise, humor, wit and brilliance. This is a excellent song not only for Cake, but for music in general. And to this day, nobody has made anything like it...","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Jennifer is a great success story. It seems hard to believe that its almost been 2 years since Dreamgirls came out and a fan like me was wondering when is she ever going to release her debut CD. In the end i realized that perhaps her heart just wasn't to into the MUSIC. Finally Spotlight gets released and its a cute single. It took a bit to grow on me but it has a great chorus and nice background vocals. Other then that after spinning this album a few times i still haven't found any redeeming tracks that i love or tracks that stand out enough to be a winner. This album seemed very directionless and if any artist takes 2 years to churn out an album you should either have a masterpiece or an album done half azz job. Unfortunately thats what we get here, something half done. I guess over the course of 2 years she just sang track to track when she had free time or nothing to do. Jennifer already has a very soulful voice so adding a church choir to some of the background vocals only sends the song to ethnic over drive. \"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\" shouldnt even be on this album. I felt like the producers were doing everything they can to provide fans with as little new material as possible. Adding that song was trying so hard to make this release have over 10 songs. The song from the Sex & The City soundtrack isn't even on here. The last song about Jesus is ridiculous!!! What does Jennifer know about a Jewish Rabbi whose mother claimed she had her son without intercourse. There's only really 1 good song on this entire album and thats the Diane Warren written song. None of the tracks here seem interesting, relevant, or addictive enough to keep me interested. Here's hoping that her next album will have better producers.\n\nStand out tracks are:\nYou Pulled Me Through (Best Song on the Album 10\/10)\nSpotlight (Good 08\/10)\nIf This Isnt Love (Good 08\/10)","classification":1,"fold":0}

{"text":"Time for another Big Bach Guild Box - and here are some of our thoughts that we wanted to share with you.\n\n1. We definitely read each review and we want to thank everyone who takes the time to send their thoughts, short or long.\n\n2. We have endeavored mightily to insure that this Box is error free. Unfortunately, there have been too many errors in the past. We apologize. If there are more issues, please send us an email or reply to this post and we will try and fix whatever is wrong.\n\n3. Now, on to how we put this box together. We spent a lot of time blathering on about the importance of Bachs cantatas in the early years of the Bach Guild. But as the years went on, Seymour Solomon became much more involved in recording many of Handels oratorios and vocal works. And so alongside the cantatas, a marvelous catalog of groundbreaking Handel recordings were made.\n\n4. Many of you have written about your desire for us to avoid using recordings a second time - and that has proven a challenge for this box when offering Handels most commercial works. Water Music, the flute sonatas and Messiah have all appeared on other boxes. We thought about simply creating a vocals only box, which would be filled with extraordinary performances, and probably be about 100 hours long, but we had to allow for new customers who didn't buy the Big Christmas or Big Baroque collections.\n\n5. However, fans of Handels vocal music, Rejoice, greatly! This set does include a marvelous, really marvelous collection of high quality performances of Handels vocal and choral output. Most of it is new to digital download - almost all of the vocal performances are new to Amazons customers.\n\n6. When we put together these sets, we do like to please the knowledgeable customers who are looking for previously unreleased material - and weve seen in some of the longer reviews some members are very in-tune with what is available and what isnt. The goodies in this set are the Rutgers University Choir recordings of the Chandos Anthems, which has been completely unavailable digitally until now, and has been out of print on CD for almost 20 years. The recording of Alexanders Feast is only available digitally as part of a much larger set. Same with my own personal favorite, the recording that leads off this box, the Ode on the Birthday of Queen Anne, with that magical opening Eternal Source, a favorite recording of Alfred Deller and Seymour Solomon of Vanguard. There are also some oboe concerti that have never been available digitally as well.\n\n8. We have tried to remain true to a recorded quality - many of you have written about the transfers. The transfers can be difficult to trace, particularly in recordings from the late 1950s and early 1960s, when stereo and mono masters were made as a matter of routine. The CD masters were not always strong when they indicated which master was used - we have tried to use stereo where possible, but at times, the mono masters, occasionally unmarked as mono are used as the recorded source. However, some recordings are mono; there are no stereo sources. We really have no way in this space to indicate that. We will try to do it on our web site. And to answer one comment from the Mozart Box - we never, ever use LPs as our source. We are tempted often - there are some sublime recordings by Anton Heiller and Kenneth Cooper of Handels harpsichord suites that we were not able to include because the masters are in terrible shape - but we just avoided them instead of mastering from LP. Perhaps in a different release, but not in our Big Boxes.\n\nPlease enjoy this set! Our next set, of Vivaldi, will be out soon!","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"All hail the queen of teen angst! The woman who always got the last laugh in her break-ups by stabbing them with her blatant, sharp lyrics, Alanis Morrisette comes back with her third American full-length release to tell us about wrong-doing lovers and general sessions of emotional outbursts.\nHow can one forget the power that \"Jagged Little Pill\" instilled in every troubled heart clutching the Walkman during recess. Her American debut not only skyrocketed her to super stardom but also set a standard for rock music.\n\"You Oughta Know\" became the national anthem of heartbreak and \"Ironic\" showed us that no matter how many words there are in a lyric, Alanis can somehow manage to cram them all into one chorus. That, and how many ways something might seem like it should be ironic but really isn't.\nAfter her name became household, she faded and came back with the less-aggressive and complex \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,\" which was a spiritual, more mature approach about life and its stakes.\n\"Junkie\" garnered less success, but contained some of Morrisette's most complete work such us the single \"Thank U\" and the incomparable \"That I Would Be Good\" - which was also featured in her next release the live \"Alanis Unplugged.\"\nNot too bad for the Ottawa-born singer who used to sing sweet pop of the Mandy Moore caliber back in the day.\nThis time Morrisette comes back with \"Under Rug Swept,\" which contains the new single \"Hands Clean\" - a growing international favorite. However, the rest of the songs on this album do not carry the same lullaby sing-along feel.\nAlanis hits hard with songs such as \"Narcissus\" - a song that is basically a blame-rant at an egotist boy. \"21 Things I Want In A Lover\" is a dry opener with rigid lyrics.\nMorrisette than delves into self-consciousness on \"So Unsexy\" - which shows why she is a winning combination.\nHer witty verbalization and gushing of words explains the most simple, yet indescribable feelings every human encounters.\nWhat is different about this album is the fact that Alanis fully produced the whole record.\n\"Flinch\" opens the conversational balladry that usually pops in an Alanis record.\nThe real melodic prize is in \"You Owe Me Nothing In Return.\" The song is good enough to be a single because of its catchiness, yet one can't tell if she is being sarcastic in her words or not - a filling treat.\nThe album closes with \"Surrendering\" and an intricately arranged optimistic ballad \"Utopia\" showing that Alanis is a true gem.\nThis album is not as angry and as straightforward as \"Jagged Little Pill\" nor is it as deep and dim as \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,\" but it is a more refined and complete rock record. \"Under Rug Swept\" will not produce a lot of hit songs, but will still stand as one of the best records of the year.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"I think half the movies Hollywood and Critics rate highly are about 70% crap and the rest good. Also on that note i think half of the movies critics rate as being horrible turn out being great, its all in personal preference. I for one really liked this film, mainly because of Josh Brolin who is great in films like No Country For Old Men, and W. He makes a go of this comic book western and i think he does a good job, for what he's given to work with. Honestly i'm not a Meagan Foxx fan at all, is she pretty, yeah she's decent, can she act, no not really. John Malkovich as a bad guy is a good idea, and he at least fits his \"small\" but evil role as the sinister bad man. I don't wanna give spoilers but this movie is really easy to follow anyways.\n\nIts just all about Jonah Hex getting revenge for his wife and kids after there death. He basically rides around looking for the men who did so, but there are some very interesting twist on how he does this. He has the power to raise the dead and ask questions, and the way this is executed is very cool, to me. I guess people were just really wanting another X-men, Sin City type comic deal but you don't get that here, not from a story perspective anyways. Josh Brolin to me could definitely be the next Eastwood, he just does the silent, low tone, southern i'm going to gun you down type voice, with the attitude like he just doesnt give a #%#t. So this is just simple film, and actually pretty damn violent for PG-13, just without all the blood. So its a simple comic book western with some good acting, and over the top effects, nothing more, nothing less. And i like it more, than most, i see.:)","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Much of Depeche Modes earlier material was more new-wave synth pop and more poppy in sound but this album is where they would become the dark depressing masters they are now. Some of the songs did stir up some controversy back when this album was released and this album was a major turning point for this amazing band.\nSomething to Do is a hard edged number that kicks this CD off. Lie To Me is an amazing song that I listen to many times without tiring. The dark melody, the sad sound to it is a treat for my ears. People Are People is a fabolous song with phat beats, killer bass lines and a sort of industrial feel. This song is about all people of all religions, races, etc. to get along regardless of their differences. This song has a great message. The ambience at the ending forever leaves this album in my memory. It doesn't matter doesn't have any major beats but has dingling synths and a both happy and sad sound to it. This song is great. Stories Of Old is another cool song but nto as great as the next one. This song is rather poppy. Somebody is a very sad piano ballad with simply pianos and Martin Gore on vocals. This song is truly a gem on this CD. Master And Servant stirred some controversy back during it's heyday. It's a hard-edged song with a strong industrial feel. This song from what I guess talks about S&M. This is my second favorite. If You Want is my favorite off SGR. It starts off as a creepy electronic song with creepy keyboards and with no drums for the first minute. At 1:30 the drums starts and the song becomes an industrial new wave dance number. Blasphemous Rumours is the one that caused controversy back in 1984. It's a very depressing song about religous doubt and suicide. It's a very sad closer to this amazing album.\nThis CD marks the turning point for Depeche Mode and all of their latter music. While not as strong as their next 5 albums this is a very good album and should be in every DM fans collection.","classification":5,"fold":0}

Unfortunately, I believe that is why everyone lately has been trying to do cover songs instead, which are more wasted because the chemistry the original artist that did record the song made you really bliss into ecstasy. That lag came from covers recently from Sia with her rendition of Natalie Cole's Unforgettable which was lagging the chemistry she and her great father showed in spirit and song, and with the Ghostbusters theme song which Fall Out Boy didn't make you feel afraid, just laugh around compared to the song back in 1984. Now, Panic! At The Disco is doing another cover for the films. Their rendition of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody actually fairs better than the other two joke covers, that really didn't thrive from the original song. Still, Panic! At The Disco is no Freddie Mercury's in disguise, but at least they can strike a bit better. Still, if you are a die hard Queen fan, you'll definitely want to stick to the original, or if area die hard Panic! At The Disco fan, than you'll want the song.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Back in 2003, someone apparently thought it was a good idea to bring the powers that were Mary J. Blige and P. Diddy back together, in hopes of re-creating the magic of their earlier works. Well, they were wrong. By no means was the result, Love & Life, a terrible album; however, almost any fan will agree that it's Mary's--for the lack of a better term--worst work to date. Yes, there were some great moments, but most of it was uninspired with some pretty lazy production, courtesy of Diddy. The disc barely went platinum, making it her lowest selling studio album by far. The ever-consistent woman who seemingly could do no wrong made a slight misstep. That's what made 2005's excellent release, The Breakthrough, such a pleasant surprise. With the huge success of \"Be Without You,\" the album's triple platinum status, its record-breaking first-week sales, and its eight Grammy nominations, it proved that Blige was on top once again and wasn't going anywhere. Two years later, she is back with Growing Pains.\n\nFrom the photos, to the lyrics, to the themes and overall sound, Mary J. is definitely getting her grown woman on. Now a wife, she speaks with brutal honesty and maturity on serious relationships. They involve work, conflicts, disagreements, dependency, compromise, pain, passion, effort, and love, of course. Although it is a beautiful thing and brings much joy to people, to quote her, \"it ain't all roses.\" I have read numerous reviews, from proffesionals nonetheless, that simply dismiss some of the lyrics as \"preachy,\" but I would have to disagree. Mary is a woman who has clearly been through many trials and tribulations in her life, and she just wants to share her wisdom and knowledge of the world to her large fanbase, who could most likely benefit from her viewpoints. (If these reviewers really can't hear these true-to-life statements without cringing, then it's probably time they put themselves in check!) The pictures in the album's booklet show Mary keeping it classier than ever.\n\nThe stunning back cover shows Mary sitting atop a cabinet of old vinyls. The only vinyl cover that you are able to decipher is Diana Ross' 1981 album, Why Do Fools Fall In Love. It is most likely just a plain coincidence, but it speaks volumes of Growing Pains. This album has the major crossover appeal that Ross possessed back in the day. While Pains will not alienate her solid fanbase that was built upon her original hip-hop\/soul (which is still very present), each track, especially \"Come To Me (Peace),\" contains a slight change in sound that could let them be comfortable on almost any radio format, not just simply R&B. This could be due to some fresh producers and songwriters that have shown much promise recently, such as Ne-Yo, Tricky, The Dream, Jazze Pha, Bryan-Michael Cox, Stargate, and the Neptunes, among others.\n\n\"Work That,\" as heard in the iTunes commercials, is a great choice for the second single. It is upbeat, inspirational, and infectious. The production by newcomer, Theron Otis Feemster, is simple and melodic, but it suits the song perfectly. On this, and a few other select tracks, Mary has a new swagger in her delivery that almost makes her sound like an MC. \"Grown Woman\" is another example of this. Over the hard-hitting and grungy hip-hop beat, she exudes confidence and pride in her womanhood. \"Stay Down\" speaks on marriage and how \"sometimes when we fight\/ it don't seem like God's desgin\/ but... I promised I would stand by you.\" My favorite line appears in the chorus, when she begs her man to \"stay down\/ we're almost to the very best part.\" The production, by ingenious Bryan-Michael Cox, complements the emotion and triumph in Mary's strong vocals. \"Roses\" finds her nowhere near being preahcy; it's about those days when you want to be left alone and quite frankly, your lover just fans the fire. In between verses, she speaks, venting her emotions. On \"Talk To Me,\" she urges her man to communicate his feelings over an Emotions horn sample, casuing the track to have a very nostalgic, old school soul feel.\n\nWhile this album is excellent, it is not flawless. Ludacris' guest appearance irritates me and almost ruins the great \"Grown Woman\" for me. His verse, while not terrible, is a bit vulgar, putting him and his supposed grown woman's bedroom business all out there. Lines like \"we some Stairmasters\/ I make her get her exercise\" seem to contradict the classiness that Mary maintains throughout the rest of the track. \"Shake Down\" sounds a bit too much like something Mariah Carey would record. (I love Mariah, I just think that it's not like something Mary would do.) It's not a bad track, though. \"Just Fine,\" oddly chosen as the lead-off single, is a song I can take or leave depending on the day and my mood. \"Till the Morning,\" however, is my least favorite track. The Neptunes' production and writing has become very bland, stale, and predictable to me by this point in time. The song sounds like Kelis-lite during her Kaleidoscope era. The bridge is good, but that's pretty much all I enjoy of the track. \"Work In Progress (Growing Pains)\" is a musically very good, but the whole I'm-just-like-you-even-though-I'm-a-celebrity thing is getting pretty tired. \"What Love Is\" is also exceptional, but lyrics like \"it feels like joy\/ it feels like pain\/ it feels like sunshine\/ it feels like rain\" are undeniably clich&eacute;.\n\nThe bottom line: It is not perfect, but Growing Pains is still a darn good album. Her vocals are on point, the production and songwriting is top notch, and the lyrics are mature and real. Growing Pains has a slightly new sound that will most likely lead to an even bigger crossover than The Breakthrough caused. Still, even her fans from the beginning will feel satisfied. How does she do it? It's a mystery. Mary J. Blige is a truly special and talented grown woman.\n\nKey tracks: Grown Woman, Stay Down, Roses, Fade Away, Talk to Me, Work That.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Jewel's 0304 is a drastic change from the folk\/pop singer we all know and adore. This album is not unlistenable like others have stated, it is just very different than her previous records. But change is good and well Jewel sure had the guts to try something fun and new. Standout tracks include: the gorgeous, Sweet Temptation, the rock-out anthem, America, the sensitive, 2 Find U, and the first single, Intuition. Some of the tracks obviously do not measure up like U plus me equals love, very silly and repetitive, Stand is awkward but has cool lyrics, and the closing song Becoming is just plain boring. But i still give this album a high rating because i love Jewel, her writing, and her raspy and lovely voice. The best song of the whole bunch is track number nine, Haunted. This song is classic Jewel. \"The fury of my conviction will cause your heart to quicken..\" Just a haunting song about a man stalking a woman. I would give this record a try if you like dance songs, it is a great summer record.","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Let me start by saying, I love Linkin Park. I have all their albums and I've seen them live five times. So I can't even begin to describe how disappointed I am in The Hunting Party. Even their last two albums (which weren't nearly as good as the ones previous) had some great highlights that made them worth the money. This album sounds like Mike and Chester are singing with a completely different band. Nine out of the 12 songs are heavy metal or speed metal which is weird and out-of-place. Their lyrics, which are usually clever and smart, have been reduced to Chester screaming, \"you don't know what you got till it's gone\" cliches. \"The Last Masquerade\" is another sound-a-like Transformers-style song. The only highlight is the first track \"Keys to the Kingdom,\" and it's barely a highlight at that. If you're a LP fan, I recommend listening to the album in it's entirety before you decide to buy.","classification":1,"fold":0}

{"text":"It's been a long time since Type O Negative have been on the scene. Too long, as a matter of fact. 2003 saw the release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Life-Is-Killing-Me\/dp\/B00009PJPT\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Life Is Killing Me<\/a>&nbsp;and the band seemed to all but vaporize since. Rest assured, however, the boys from Brooklyn are back, and frontman Peter Steele has gone through enough of a personal Hell to inspire one of the best albums of their career. \"Dead Again,\" Type O's seventh studio album sounds just as fresh as the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Bloody-Kisses\/dp\/B000000H6Y\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bloody Kisses<\/a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/October-Rust\/dp\/B000000H57\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">October Rust<\/a>, leaving no fan disappointed in it's wake.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a fanboy, I must say that this album totally blew my mind. Listening to it, I get the same feelings I did when I took my first listen of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Bloody-Kisses\/dp\/B000000H6Y\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bloody Kisses<\/a>&nbsp;oh so many years ago. It's hard to believe how long these guys have been at it, and that they have yet to get stale or boring. Whether it's the triumphant opening title track, or the gloomy ballad, \"September Sun,\" Type O Negative touch on all their previous material here, while still keeping it relevant. Others like \"Tripping A Blind Man,\" \"An Ode To Locksmiths\" and \"She Burned Me Down\" are the cream of the crop, with their punch-in-the-gut riffs that bring back old school Black Sabbath (something that Type O are the best at). Even a song like \"These Three Things,\" which clocks in at over fourteen minutes, is impossible not to enjoy. And if I'm not mistaken, I can hear a bit of confidence in Steele's voice like never before. For the first time, he truly sounds like he is releasing his demons through his music.\n\n\"Dead Again\" is quite possibly the most accessible Type O Negative record available. Granted, you're not going to be hearing this stuff on the radio much, but if you were ever a Type O Negative fan, there is surely something here for you. They are one of the few bands that can create an album that matches their earlier work without it sounding like a shameless rehash. This is easily the most inspired Type O have been in ten years. Everyone who cares for this band owes it to themselves to own a copy of \"Dead Again.\"","classification":5,"fold":0}

As can be said for each of their previous albums, the band shows continued maturity of songwriting that continues to come through their performances.\n\nLinkin Park fans are going to love this album. The twelve songs portray a band with a new sense of purpose and mission. Present is more of the energy and edginess that made the band the revered band that it is.\n\nThe three randomly selected tunes to highlight for you are:\n\nWastelands  Boomerocity wagers that this song will be a crowd favorite.

It has an almost anthem-like sound and feel to it. Im anxious to see if this song gets the traction that I think it will get.\n\nIll end this reviews as I did with my review of the Living Things CD: Linkin Park fans are going to eat this album up and love every musical morsel of it.

But for her teaming up with Babyface for the first time in years, as a duet partner with a new song, the question is do they both have the chemistry to sing together? Well, it is more like a hurt than really a hit. Hurt You, the lead single from her upcoming album Love, Marriage & Divorce isn't actually a striking song. The two of them have lost their rhythm in the song. It also feels that Toni really didn't give her all unlike Babyface which he did well in Give U My Heart years ago for the Boomerang soundtrack with Toni.

Upon listening it becomes clear very quickly she has not only the voice but also the songs to back up this confidence.\n\nIf I didn't know any better, I'd have just as easily guessed this was from 1978 than 2005, sharing as it does a real kinship in sound to (then) emerging singers like Chrissie Hynde, Debbie Harry and in particular Kate Bush. Like Bush's debut 'The Kick Inside', arrangements here swoon and soar, choruses surprise and there's an almost frightening level of intensity at times, which makes for riveting listening throughout. It's also an album that's unafraid to tackle difficult subject matter, though for me, much of it is simply about attempting to transcend life's limitations.\n\nAfter all that verbosity, all you really need to know is this is a beautiful collection of songs by a striking new artist - and if you like her brother Rufus, then odds are you'll like Martha Wainwright too.","classification":4,"fold":0}

Production wise Prince took drum programming to whole nother level while the old cats where struggling to make a drum machine sound an feel like a live drummer, Prince seen the future of funk, that kick snare pattern just loops for 8 minutes, with various breakdowns from the electric toms lol, but all the other instruments get to play freely an make it feel like what it is a funk jam where all the little nuances go a long way the Sly scream that during 80's was part of his trademark hits, the rappin \"I don't wanna be a poet...\" The wicked bass line the master overdubbing makes you feel like it was recorded live at first avenue in Minneapolis, you can taste the sweat off the party goers just funky. All studio. Very few artist could replicate this level of funk in a studio. I mean sure George an Parliament had 8, 9 minutes jams but they also had an army of nearly 12 to 20 people to do it.

They had new albums and new bands from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Los-Lobos\/dp\/B000CCD0F8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Los Lobos<\/a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Blasters\/dp\/B000VUTP4G\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Blasters<\/a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Bodeans\/dp\/B00005Y1Y4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Bodeans<\/a>. They all got sort of lumped into the 'new wave' category, but there was something more going on here. \"Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams\" was one of the best embodiments of this group of bands, and reissue, almost 25 years after the fact, shows why.\n\nThe Bodeans were young and enthusiastic kids who wanted to make their own sound. Being from Wisconsin, they has no burning desire to be trendy or fashionable, just to make music that felt like escape to them. With the first thrilling notes of \"She's A Runaway\" and the rocking theme of breakout the song offers, it's an instant classic that should have slotted in comfortably next to the Springsteen or Mellencamp hits of the day. T-Bone Burnette heard the truth inside the songs and the vocal magic Kurt Neumann and Sam Llanas made, and hauled them away to Los Angeles to make this album. \"Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams\" is a missing link of an album, the chain the runs between The Everly Brothers and The Rolling Stones (from whom the album nicked its title).\n\nThe remaster sounds incredible. The BoDeans were still fresh and excited, with T-Bone at the top of his early production game. \"Rickshaw Riding\" has sudden space in its slowbreathing sound. \"Looking for Me Somewhere\" sounds like Johnny Cash passed on it to hand it over to these youngsters. And the bonus track \"Turn Your Radio On\" makes you wonder why this Chuck Berry-ish rocker got left behind.\n\nThe there's the DVD, a homecoming of sorts with a live Minneapolis concert from 1985. Again, there's this brash enthusiasm that only a hungry young band could muster, and it's great fun to watch. It's east to see why (if you believe Kurt's liner notes) the T-Bone urged the suits at Warners to sing The Bodeans because \"they're gonna be bigger than The Beatles.\" It includes songs that never made it to the studio albums done in front of a hometown audience, excited that their local heroes just might be the next big thing. \"Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams\" captures that desire, and this re-issue - from the good folks at Rhino - makes you scratch your head as to why it didn't happen.","classification":4,"fold":0}

Remember you is cool but Wiz ruined for rapping about stuff that had absolutely noting to do with the song, its supposed to be about a girl but all he does is spot braggadocios lyrics. Wiz said that this album was gonna be like Kush & Orange Juice, which is a classic mixtape by the way but this is nothing like that. Too much filler on this album, if your subject matter is that limited its no way you should have a 17 track album. No need to waste your money on this, diehard Wiz fans might love it but that's about it.

There is different music on each, the blue has a few covers of older (mostly Mowtown)music, like JIMMY MACK. The track listing for this RED album is: 1: WHEN I'M GONE, 2: FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM, 3: HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU, 4: AH SHOOT, 5: MORE AND MORE, 6: I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, 7: I WANNA MAKE IT (IN YOUR WORLD), 8: MY EVERTHING. \/ The song HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was a single, it was even released as a \"Disco Single Remix\" with a longer disco sound.

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library.  With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing.  It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.  Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon.  Thats right!  Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too.  In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.  Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great!  At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free\n\nFREE ALBUMS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Albums by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":0}

It has a laid back atmosphere that decently complements Masta Killa's delivery but the majority of the end is either talking or skits. The production is rather all over the place as some have that Wu-Tang trademark sound while others go on a West Coast synthesized appeal. Masta Killa performs decently with his slow delivery, deep lyrics, and somewhat average flow but the lack of solid hooks, too many skit-time, and change in production kills it. Add his weak attempt to sound like ODB (he is paying homage) and you get annoyed. This is more of a backpack album, beware.","classification":2,"fold":0}

Her latest song Focus, is honestly one of those that really shows she has not delivered better at the soul. She really made a song that really says, \"I am catering to a young audience and not branching out to where I can do better for everyone.\" I personally feel that Arianda can do much better, and she has not been able to do so.

{"text":"MR RONALD ISLEY of the ISLEY BROTHERS has gotten me by surprise with the release of his second solo album entitled \"THIS SONG IS FOR YOU\". I never know about it or it's upcoming release but when I heard the hit single \"DINNER AND A MOVIE\" on the air, I was like \"wow, RONALD does it again!!\". As a die hard fan, I've got it and is very pleased with it overall. His voice is as sweet, romantic and forceful as ever, singing and music is indeed his destiny, he is so determined and resilient for his age. It is as if it was preordained to be so. I truly honor and respect him a lot. He is indeed a true musical legend...And the legacy continues!!!.\n\nAll the songs on this masterpiece is well written and produced, vocal and instrumental arrangements well done but listening to the entire record I detect a basic sameness in almost all the songs, reading the inlay booklet I came to realize that almost all the songs was written, arranged and produced by MR TROY TAYLOR. Next time RON needs to use different writers and producers to include more variety in his recordings. Due to his legendary status, most of the writers and producers of the present is somewhat beneath him. The seasoned ones would do him well.\n\nComing in at 12 songs and clocking a tad over 40 minutes, the album is a very good listen, I prefer it to his previous release, it's much more laid back with out the hip hop influence.\n\nThe program starts with the title track \"THIS SONG IS FOR YOU\", it gives a MARVIN GAYE meets AL GREEN effect, it's very good but too brief. My absolute favorite song on this project is the mellow and soothing \"DINNER AND A MOVIE\", perfect in every way, a modern stroll down memory lane.\n\"MY FAVORITE THING\", featuring the super talented KEM is as good as it gets, overall, another good song.\n\"THE BOSS\", \"BED TIME\", \"HE WON'T EVER LOVE YOU\", \"LET'S BE ALONE\" and \"LAY YOU DOWN\" featuring TREY SONGZ are pretty decent too, RON is trying to fit in with the guys of the present, not bad at all.\nDo we need a \"BETWEEN THE SHEETS\" part two?. No!!. Not at all but \"ANOTHER NIGHT\" is a perfect fill in!!.\nWell it's a different story with the modern classic \"REUNION\", this cut is superb, I love this song, well done, nice leads!!.\n\n\"BETTER OR WORSE\" is also another excellent record, slow, mellow and reassuring.\nThe final cut is the \"VOYAGE TO ATLANTIS\" reminder, \"MAKE LOVE TO YOUR SOUL\" yes...this one takes you back then brings you back..another favorite here.\nOverall, the entire album is excellent.\n\nMR RONALD ISLEY has indeed given us his very all for well over 50 years.

{"text":"This is the album that cemented Madonna's career and let the world know that she was here to stay! After three internationally successful albums, Madonna closes out the decade that made her famous with a monster of an album, which garnered the singer the most commercial and critical success, as well as controversy, up to this point in her career. This album set the stage for everything Madonna was going to do in the years to come and proved to pop music listeners everywhere that the pop diva wasn't going anywhere any time soon. Here are my rankings of the songs:\n1. \"Like a Prayer\" - 10\/10\n2. \"Express Yourself\" - 10\/10\n3. \"Love Song\" - 7\/10\n4. \"Til Death Do Us Part\" - 7\/10\n5. \"Promise to Try\" - 8\/10\n6. \"Cherish\" - 9\/10\n7. \"Dear Jessie\" - 9\/10\n8. \"Oh Father\" - 8\/10\n9. \"Keep it Together\" - 8\/10\n10. \"Spanish Eyes\" - 9\/10\n11. \"Act of Contrition\" - 7\/10","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"I really like OneRepublic.  I remember when I first heard `Apologize' and I was instantly hooked.  I love their style and their sound and Ryan Tedder's voice is magic to my ears.  He has the perfect falsetto, yet he never comes off as anything less than masculine in his delivery.  Lyrically, they have a nice repertoire, and just when I think that they can't one-up themselves I hear the next track and I'm engaged all over again.\n\nAll of this said, they have yet to produce an album as universally complete as I know they are capable of.\n\nIn parts `Waking Up' is a great album.  Sadly, OneRepublic winds up tied down by the one thing that makes them so unique; their sound.  When you hear any of the songs on this album it is instantly obvious that it is a One Republic song.  Even before Ryan starts serenading us, we know that his voice is about to be broadcast.  OneRepublic has a signature sound that they drench each and every track on this album with to the point where their songs start to run into one another.\n\nIt's a shame, I know.\n\nThe eleven tracks on this album range from great to mediocre, with only really one song standing out as unappealing to me, but then again only three stand out as truly amazing to me.\n\nThe album opens with a gigantic bang, the first three songs basically setting the bar SO high that the only way to go from there was down.  `Made For You' is a fantastic opening track, perfectly fusing the pop beats with the soft piano and that chorus is just hauntingly hushed yet loud with emotional merit.  `All the Right Moves' keeps the energy high with a chorus so energetically engrossing you can't help but become a part of the song.  Still, `Secrets' is even better.  The musical opening is stunning and instantly grabs the listener.  The lyrical content is pure and poignant.  When the songs snaps into attention less than 40 seconds in with that stunning chorus you know that you have found this bands opus.\n\nAnd then the album starts to spiral away from itself.\n\n`Everybody Loves Me' is rich with satirical content, but it just doesn't manage to be anything more than a Beck soundalike.  `Good Life' is `happy-inducing' but it is also a tad lazy.  It just sounds so familiar for them, with no real newness to it.  That said, I really like the song.  In fact, I really like the entire album, it just doesn't wow me like I expected after that one-two-THREE punch right off the bat.  `Marchin On' has grown on me, if not for the fact that it shows true ambition.  It can feel a tad long, but no where near as long as the title track, `Waking Up', comes off as.  In fact, that song is the one that I just DO NOT LIKE.  It is just really bland and it carries on for far too long.  `Missing Persons 1 & 2' is nice and subtle, yet it doesn't leave a major impact.  It is pretty to listen to, but Ryan's voice does seem to strain in parts.  I do like the haunting quality to the song, but it just doesn't live up to potential.  The shift in song structure is also odd.  Why didn't they separate this into two tracks?  `All This Time' sounds like something they've already done, with no real spark or anything to remember.  In fact, it actually sounds a tad dated.  `Fear' is simply forgettable.  It almost feels like an afterthought.\n\nThe closing song `Lullaby' would have been less disappointing had the rest of the album been more impressive.  It isn't a bad song at all, and it would generally be a great way to end an album (soft, sweet, serene) but instead it just becomes another seemingly dull song.\n\nIn the end, I still give this album a B and recommend it if you are a fan of the group.  Ryan Tedder is going to stick around (highly in demand as a song writer and producer as well) so I don't expect this band to go away anytime soon, which is a good thing.  I want them to release an album that lives up to what I know they can create.  They have the goods and they have a unique and signature sound that I really wish they would use to the full instead of allowing it to defeat them by rendering them seemingly `one-note'.\n\nHere is my ranking for those interested:\n\n1) Secrets\n2) Made for You\n3) All the Right Moves\n4) Good Life\n5) Marchin On\n6) Everybody Loves Me\n7) Lullaby\n8) Missing Persons 1 &2\n9) All This Time\n10) Fear\n11) Waking Up","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Excerpt taken from \"New Business Science Times\":\n\n\"It has been a long and hard journey for the fledgling sound systems corporation, Weyland Sonics.\nIndustry insiders were shocked by the fatalities and property damage created by their first offering \"Taylor 1.2\".\nMost considered this line as a complete write-off.\n\n  The cost of repairing Houston's infrastructure alone was enough to make most corporations file for bankruptcy.\nUndaunted, the new CEO of W.S., Charles Bleaufeldt, revamped their entire Research division. \"Youth, Youth, Youth!\" was the mantra for the\nnew CEO. \"We need sounds younger than Juice Newton, more strident than Ga-Ga 2.0 and lets keep the bio-covering as flat as possible!\"\n\n  His staff did complain and many resigned. One researcher, a Mr. Arno Stark, left to create his own tech company.\nMr Stark told me: \"Horrible, just horrible! By the time I left, I was drinking every day. The sound that thing made!\nThere is no ear protection made that can save you. Three techs were made permanently deaf! There is no controlling this thing!\"\n\n  Earlier this year, Mr. Bleaufeldt did unveil his new creation at the Branson Sound Technologies Expo.\nHe decided to change the name, from \"Taylor 3.4.5.2\" to the more appealing \"Taylor RED\".\nIndustry leaders were shocked by its ultra-thin bio-covering but were amazed by its speech emulation capacity. Here is a sample:\n'Hi, I'm Taylor. I love the number 13. *whirrrrr-click-click-click*  I like imagining what life was like hundreds of years ago.\n*whirrrrr-click-click-click* I have blurry eyesight. I'm easily excited, thrilled, scared, and shocked. *whirrrrr-click-click-click*\nI live in Nashville, *whirrrrr-click-click-click*'\n\n  Simply amazing! During Taylor-Red's debut it proved its effectiveness as a sonic weapon by disintegrating a 5 ton block of granite\nfrom 20 feet away. Needless to say, the military was very impressed and rumors abound about the many orders they are placing.\nBleaufeldt is now considering building a miniature version of Taylor-Red for the European market.\"","classification":1,"fold":0}

{"text":"Michael Jackson gave us so much wonderful music during his lifetime; and this two CD set showcases his fine talent. Michael is consistently at the top of his game on these tracks; there's not a dud in the bunch. The quality of the sound on these two CDs is excellent and I like the artwork as well.\n\n\"I Want You Back\" starts the first CD off with Michael doing a great job with the rest of The Jackson 5; they sing and play this to perfection--and beyond! \"ABC\" is very catchy. \"Got To Be There\" is a very romantic song that is truly a classic; Michael's genius is clearly abundant even at a very early age. He sings \"Got To Be There\" with all his heart and soul; and he never lets go of a single superfluous note, either! \"Rockin' Robin\" is infectiously catchy and upbeat, too--and how's about that guitar solo?\n\n\"Ben\" is a masterpiece even if Michael is singing a song about a pet rat (!!!); Michael's excellent diction makes \"Ben\" even more beautiful. \"Enjoy Yourself\" again has Michael with the rest performing just wonderfully; and it's got that `70s beat I always like so much. \"Blame It on the Boogie\" is still perfect for dancing nearly wherever you are; and there's yet another gem in \"Shake Your Body (Down To the Ground).\" Listen also for Michael to deliver \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" without ever skipping a beat; and he does outstanding work as he sings \"Rock with You;\" \"Off The Wall\" and a great duet with Paul McCartney entitled \"The Girl Is Mine.\" \"Billie Jean\" was a huge hit for Michael when it was released; and it remains one of his best tunes ever. It's got some beat! \"Beat It\" is yet another jewel on the first CD. \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" is another catchy, infectious tune that sticks in your mind forever once you hear it; and I especially like \"Thriller;\" \"Thriller\" is timeless and just one listen proves it!\n\n\"Bad\" is another awesome tune that features Michael squarely front and center; that music fits in perfectly with his vocals but wisely they never try to steal the show away from MJ--he stands right there, front and center where he belongs! \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" gets a most sensitive treatment from Michael and Siedah Garrett; and \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" is pop music at its very best. \"Man in the Mirror\" is a meaningful tune with a sensitive flavor to it; and Michael does a superb job on \"Another Part of Me.\" I love it! \"Black or White\" is very well done; Michael sings this with lots of energy and it helps the number a lot. \"Heal The World\" is very sweet and easy on the ear--this music lacks nothing, it's all THAT good.\n\n\"Remember The Time\" has an eerie sound to it that nevertheless sounds really good; it's truly more classic pop as only Michael could do it. \"Will You Be There\" uses a choir in the background for a nice effect; and \"Dangerous\" has some beat! \"You Are Not Alone\" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard; no wonder why so many people love Michael Jackson's songs! The second CD ends well with MJ performing \"You Rock My World.\" Awesome!\n\nMichael Jackson fans should consider this a \"must-have\" for their collections; and it has so many songs that it makes the perfect introduction to MJ and his music for newcomers just discovering his magic. I highly recommend this two CD set.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Almost all the reviewers on youtube say this album is trash because there is no Jim Morrison...well hell, shallow people.\n\nThis album, many of the tracks were rehearsed while Jim was alive and wouda been the next album.  Ray Manzerik comes in on most of the vocals and does a very good job.\n\nYou can sense the songs structure and feel were made for Jim Morrison to come in the studio and lay down his vocals on the tracks, but it didn't happen.\n\n\"Tightrope Ride\" was the single released and I am amazed it wasn't atleast a top 40 hit, the album must not have been promoted too much by the label, although it did reach No. 35 on the charts and thats not bad, having the 35th most popular album in America.\n\nThe song \"Ships with Sails\" is a amazing song and if you heard it, you'd KNOW it's classic Doors all the way, a great 6+ min tune that kinda resembles \"Riders on the storm\".\n\nThe opening song \"In the Eye of the Sun\" is also a great Doors song that has that great Doors sound.\n\nThis album has been ignored long enough, bring it back, release it on CD, its not a Morrison release, but its the Doors and it's a great album!","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"I'm going to do something that some of you out there reading might consider highly unusual.  I'm going to pick this song apart and explain why each and every part of it is so irresistibly awesome.  \"Reflections\" might just be the greatest song Diana Ross & the Supremes ever released.  This song must have come on the radio a million times throughout the country over the years, and I wouldn't mind listening to it a million times myself.  Here we go!\n\nIt starts off on an unusual note for the first few seconds with swirling machinery-type sounds that seems totally out of place at first but now that I've heard the song so many times, I believe these chaotic sounds are supposed to represent the confusion and emotional distraught that Diana Ross feels through her rollercoaster emotional state of mind.\n\nThen Diana Ross begins to sing... and her voice *alone* is brilliant.  It sounds so tender with *just* the right hoarse sound.  Like a young woman who's finally had enough of having someone hold her down, so she's going to stand up and express exactly how she feels.  Like she's on stage and it's her turn to speak, or sing in this case, what's on her mind.  I actually never noticed she had a hoarse voice until recently and it's more noticeable in her early days when she was younger.  I LOVE it!\n\nThen we have the Supremes providing the really somber and suspense-building \"ooooo, oo-oo-oo\" behind Diana's powerful vocals.  Listen to the perfectly executed way the \"oooo\" dreamily soothes and creates tension during the way Diana sings the line \"Through the mirrors of my mind, through these tears I am crying\".  With the Supremes providing back-up, now this song takes on a whole new meaning.  Without the Supremes Diana's vocals would have been great as it is, but WITH the Supremes?  Now it's just insanely good!\n\nWhat proves this band had a knack for totally absorbing into your emotional state of mind is perfectly summed up in the way Diana sings the line \"I'm all alone now, no love to shield me, trapped in a world of distorted reality\".  Suddenly, during this particular line, the song shifts in a VERY different direction as Diana stands alone.  What was once suspenseful tension building courtesy of both Diana Ross and the Supremes NOW feels like someone who's soul has been crushed to the point that whenever they think about their past, they feel cold and angry.  If my words aren't clear, this is one EXTREMELY powerful tempo change but the lyrics tell a story with such ease that it's easy to not acknowledge what a spectacular moment of the song this is.\n\nIt took me a LONG time to notice there's a speedy bass section playing in the background, and what appears to be a violin or string section playing a few notes rapidly for a few seconds during the above mentioned tempo change.  It's brief and easy to not notice unless you're playing REALLY close attention.  And how about the orchestration at the 1:50 mark?  It's now very demanding and seems to illustrate Diana's emotions all coming to a head and she's either on the verge of a nervous breakdown or realizing that she needs to ditch her troubled past as soon as possible.  This is ANOTHER really powerful moment.  Granted, my interpretation probably isn't the same as Diana's, but that's okay- we all interpret music differently.\n\nThe song finishes on a more optimistic note with dramatically more promising vibes the way Diana Ross demandingly sings \"Reflections of, the way life used to be\" with a pounding rhythm illustrating a brighter future.  The tone of the song right here at this point seems to paint a picture of someone who's learned to move on from a troubled relationship and won't dare repeat the same mistakes again.\n\nAnd just to throw in some humor, it's fun to misinterpret a line near the end that is a popular misheard lyric- \"In the UFO!\"  No Diana is actually saying \"In the you and I\" and the Supremes providing their own vocals makes it easy to misunderstand what is actually being sung here.  BUT!  If you consider the odd sound effects that appear on at least two occasions (in the beginning and when Diana sings the line \"happiness you took from me and left me alone with only memories\" and the line near the end \"I see a dream that's lost from the hurt you have caused\") you could actually be led to believe she's singing about UFO's, haha.\n\nSo what is it about \"Reflections\" that is so magnificent?  It's that it goes through many emotional shifts in such a way that for 3 glorious minutes leaves you completely stunned.  Sadness, optimism, worry, fear, deserted... these are just some of the feelings I experience.  If you love the song as much as I do and hopefully you do, you should be able to detect all these emotions and more!  Most artists could spend their entire careers creating something with as much emotion that Diana Ross & the Supremes summed up honestly in one 3-minute song, and that my friends is downright amazing.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"The one very noticeable feature of \"XXX\" is that Chicago seem frozen in time. To me, their last album was \"Twenty One\" back in 1991. \"XXX\" could easily be the follow up judging by the musical direction the band takes here. I'd say this album is most identical to Chicago 16 through 21. It has the streamlined, by the book, paint by numbers, manufactured syrupy saccharine assembly line power ballads and lite funk\/jazz pieces you'd expect from 1980's era Chicago. What happened? It's as if the boys missed grunge\/rap\/hip-hop\/hip-pop and have released an extremely American Idol friendly album.\n\nThat being said, the 12 songs are fairly homogenous and melodic. I don't hear any hits here because all the songs sound like they could be made by any MOR\/AOR band right now. The guest musicians don't really add anything original to the Chicago sound. The horns seem more present with less keyboards. There isn't a truly awful song on \"XXX\", but it's just bland and banal pop, and nothing that could match Chicago 16-19. I don't believe \"XXX\" has anything that really resembles their 1970's output, which is a shame, because there are still fans waiting for Chicago to really kick out the jams like they used to and sideline this David Foster-cursed pop they've been producing for the past 24 years.\n\nI also felt it a waste of space to have two versions of their first single \"Feel\". I listened to both and there wasn't any major difference between the two, so I'd go with the \"Hot Single Mix\" version.\n\nIt just seems to me that after nearly 40 years Chicago should be taking more chances with their music. They have absolutely nothing to lose at this point.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"In 1963, Miles Davis took his new quintet-- tenor saxophonist George Coleman, pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter and drummer Tony Williams on the road.  No less than three live albums-- \"Miles Davis in Europe\", \"My Funny Valentine\", and \"Four and More\" were drawn from these shows.  \"Miles Davis in Europe\" is the weakest of these.\n\nThe set consists of a handful of originals and standards Davis had been associated with for several years and Victor Feldman's \"Joshua\", recorded in this studio the previous month.  The performances are decent enough, but it seems to lack something.  Part of the problem is that Davis is at times detached-- his performance on \"Autumn Leaves\" for example finds him pretty really not digging in at all (curiously enough, Coleman digs deep and produces a real gem of a performance).  Much of the rest of the set shows that this was a very new band-- \"Milestones\" and \"Joshua\" both find Davis running full bore and soloing explosively (particularly the latter, where Tony Williams pushes him on and on), but when Davis' solo ends and Coleman takes over, the intensity drops way down, particularly on \"Milestones\" where Coleman seems to run out of steam.\n\nFor all these gripes, there are still quite a bit of brilliant performances-- \"Walkin'\" is probably worth the price of the disc alone-- Davis comes skidding in and whirls through his solo before turning over to Coleman, whose angular solo is unceasingly inventive.  And Davis really digs in deep on \"I Thought About You\", opening in a ballad form and really cutting loose into a deep blues feel.\n\nStill, all in all, there are other recordings by this band that are significantly better-- start with the studio effort or the other two live albums (recorded some time later), come back to this one if you need more.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"For his first album in many years Henley has decided to go in a country direction.  Some of this material will undoubtedly remind people of early Eagles albums, when the band was essentially more country than rock.  How much you like country music my influence how much you like this album.  For me, this one does not really rank up there with Henleys best and I find it to be a rather middle of the road release.  There is a ton of country star power to be found here, with several guest vocalists, and some of the best Nashville session players in the city appearing on the album.  There are more covers to be found here than on a typical Henley release as well.  I buy Henley albums mainly for his songwriting, so for me that is a bit of a disappointment.  This is not to say that there are not any good songs here, as there are quite a few that I really like including, Take A Picture Of This, Waiting Tables, That Old Flame, and Train In The Distance.  The final track Where I Am Now seems to sum up Henleys acceptance of his age and place in the world ending the album on a rather more upbeat note than most Henley fans are probably used too.  In the end this is neither a great nor terrible Henley album.  Country fans will probably get more out of it than non-country fans.","classification":3,"fold":0}

None of the R&B hybrid \"hip hop\" that so many R&B singers feel need to be all up on their albums these days. That's why I was a bit thrown to know that Future would be on this track because I was worried she was falling into that, but he's not really on the track at all. It's mostly Tamar, and her voice, as usual, sounds great. I do wish the lyrics were a bit more...present. It's a super simple song. Which isn't bad, but I'm hoping her new album coming out doesn't just have all the simple songs, but gives us the complexity we had of gems like \"Love & War\" \"White Candle\" and others on her previous one.

{"text":"The past few years have really brought out anew for pop star Amy Grant. She had moved back into her Christian roots well with her core audience, but unfortunate, she hasn't been able to click with newer music buyers. Since her A&M catalog was recently moved over to EMI, on her label Sparrow. While so many acts have done well with a new label in catalog sales, Amy still has a long way to return to the success she had a long time ago. A few years ago, it was well said with her previous hits package Greatest Hits 1986-2004 which did very well with the actual appeal. Now that she has another hits package, does Amy Grant really have the appeal she once conquered with record buyers?\n\nAmy Grant's 2007 Greatest Hits mixes in a bit of the old and the new that Amy had delivered well from her 90's pop mix, to her contemporary mixes of soul and Christian music. The songs have been remastered nicely, and tries to deliver nicely as a re-introduction to Amy to a whole new audience. The collection includes some of her great gems like Every Heartbeat and Baby Baby, to her contemporary Christian classics like Lead Me On and Father's Eyes. While the collection works fairly well for new fans, it misses a few great songs from her pop era that worked better from her previous hits package. The collection overlooks a few great tracks like The Next Time I Fall, her often overlooked duet with former Chicago singer Peter Cetera, as well as The Things We Do For Love, which she did for the Ellen Degeneres film Mr. Wrong, and her delightful cover of Joni Mitchell's Big Yellow Taxi from House Of Love, which had a very colorful video, and a better beat than when Joni recorded it years ago.\n\nAll in all, Amy Grant's Greatest Hits isn't a bad collection though, but it just doesn't deliver like the A&M days really did, or her previous Greatest Hits 1986-2004 album, which unfortunately is no longer in print. Hopefully, there could be a better hits collection that could attract Amy's great pop days like that one did, but this one could've had more to be desired, and that makes it a missed heartbeat.\n\nAlbum Cover: B\n\nSongs: C\n\nPrice: C+\n\nRemastering: B-\n\nOverall: C 1\/2+","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"I don't expect much from these 99 downloads of classical music on amazon, so I feel the need to call out any download that exceeds my expectations.\n\nThis Wagner selection from Red Classics is such a case.\n\nFirst, the sound is really first-rate for an MP3. These sound like analogue recordings that were well mastered, or perhaps digital recordings that were done with a simple mic set-up (I could be totally wrong on this). In any case, the recordings sound open, clear and natural.\n\nSecond, there are some major artists to be heard here, and in performances that represent them at their best. Soprano Sylvia Sass sounds big-voiced and wonderful in \"Dich, teure Halle,\" big voiced and a bit squally in Isolde's Libestod. Her voice is a cross between Nilsson and Mdl. Hermann Prey's \"Evening Star\" is excellent as well. The choruses - especially the women's chorus in their exposed bits - are really top drawer, while the orchestras are proficient and well balanced. Professional might be a word that springs to mind.\n\nWhat's missing is the sense of the music's potential being fully realized the way it does when a master conductor like Karajan or Kempe is leading the proceedings (which is why I held back on giving this a 5-star review, but that was a very close call).\n\nYou could do a lot worse than what's offered in this download, and from artists whose reputations in this repertoire far exceed those of the Bulgarian (et al) orchestras and choruses here featured.\n\nRecommended.","classification":4,"fold":0}

Starting of with an intense acoustic set showcasing his considearble picking skills that ends with a surprise \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\", a song he hasn't played in recent years, here nailed perfectly. He even hits some of those high vocal notes. In fact he seems to be in the best of form both vocally and overall. Thx to a clean up of his act and succesful cancer treatment.\n\nAfter the break he dives into a solid electric performance backed by a congenial band anchored by the always inventive drumming of long time musical partner Joe Vitale. And here the show really takes flight with classics like \"Bluebird\", \"For What it's Worth\", \"Dark Star\". But also some lesser known tunes like \"Rock & Roll Woman\" and the stylish \"I Wanna Make Love To You\" (from the Stills-Young album).\n\nThe often reclusive Stills comes across here as a humorous and relaxed performer facing a great and enthusiastic crowd. The days when he was a pioneering artist may be long gone, but he can sure still deliver a magnificient evening armed with a collection of songs many others would have to envy him. Blues, rock, country, latin, impressive wah-wah drenched psychedelic solos all blend into one.\n\nLike the recent brilliant album of Manassas outtakes<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Pieces\/dp\/B002JG669C\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pieces<\/a>this is essential stuf for any CSN(Y) fan.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Chicago XXX is the band's first straight pop record since 1991's Chicago Twenty 1.  Despite the fifteen year gap, the album sounds like it could have been released that same year.  Keying on the power ballads that were a staple of the late 80's and early 90's, the band plays to their strengths.  \"King Of Might Have Been\" is strong ballad that is faintly reminiscent of \"Hard To Say I'm Sorry\", \"Caroline\" has some meaty guitar riffs and \"Better\" is accentuated by the classic Chicago horn sound.  Only the album's opener, \"Feel\" which has a spacey trip hop beat, strays from their tried and true sound.","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Ellie Goulding struck it big with her Billboard #5 hit, \"Lights\".  Prior to releasing that hit, she released the lesser known, but exceptionally good song \"Starry Eyed\".  Unlike \"Lights\", \"Starry Eyed\" has a slower, more deliberate pace for a ballad about being caught in those moments where lovers are lost in each other's world together.  One of the nicer aspects of \"Starry Eyed\" is the accompanying music video, which has Ellie and her on-screen boyfriend stargazing and getting lost together at twilight.  For anyone who is a fan of \"Battlestar Galactica\", they could easily make you think of Apollo and Starbuck.  Ellie is going to be big.  I can't wait for her next work.","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"2012 proved to be for pop music a ladies' affair: There was the re-vamped femme fatale who seduced every haunted human soul (Lana Del Rey-\"Born to die\"). The latina diva who waved a bouncey first-chapter-career-retrospective farewell (J.Lo-\"Dance again: The hits\"). The street chic who went officially bad with no remorse (Rihanna-\"Unapologetic\"). The Queen of Bitches who got painfully de-throned by that remorseless chick (Madonna-\"MDNA\"). The Aussie miniature with the gigantic teeth who crossed a different street (Kylie-\"The Abbey Road sessions\"). The nutty rock gal who got to learn her lesson well (P!ink-\"The truth about love\"). The cooky siren who became human (Tori Amos-\"Gold dust\"). The bionic princess who tried to find her way back to fame ...and, also, the fridge (Christina Aguilera-\"Lotus\"). The groovy bohemian who got her urban\/hip-hop spirit crashed (Nelly Furtado-\"The spirit indestructable\"). The British Mariah-wannabe who started breaking beats apart from glasses (Leona Lewis-\"Glassheart\"). The Swede ESC euphoric winner whose epic debut album proved the strongest medicine (Loreen-\"Heal\"). The perky Snow White lookalike who got perkier (Katy Perry-\"Teenage Dream: The complete confection\"). The Canadian chaunteuse who warbled like mad honoring her french roots (Celine Dion-\"Sans attendre\"). And the uninvited pop-rocker who, well, remained a pop-rocker (Alanis Morissette-\"Havoc and bright lights\"). Let us not forget Adele's 2011 \"21\" album that reached 24m sales that year.\n\nTo complete the year's list of female releases, party-bimbo Ke$ha delivered her sophomore proper album. Predecessors \"Animal\" and \"Cannibal\" EP were a hybrid of party anthems, dancey riffs, cheeky lyrics and trashy attitude. Accompanied by clever videos, they produced massive hits, making Ke$ha a true sensation, an almost iconic figure among teenagers. It was only inevitable that every successful ingredient employed the first time, would be put to greater effect this third time around, too. 12 songs (16 on the deluxe edition) varying from dance electro-pop to indie hippy-chic, setting the mood even by the title, and leaving a euphoric feeling by the end of listening. Even the use of Ke$ha's trademark, the auto-tuned vocals, works in her favour on this, because it is used more discreetly. Also, on quite a few of the songs the sound is more stripped down, allowing Ke$ha's voice to come through, and she sounds rather sweet. To her credit, she co-writes the majority of the material; evidently she has got the skills, she is much more than just  the obvious glitter freak. Tracks like \"Supernatural\" and \"All that matters (The beautiful life)\" are top notch pop numbers. Fun should be mandatory, so, release your inhabitions, let the Warrior Princess lead the way, and start the party-fight!","classification":3,"fold":0}

{"text":"Reznor's \"Ghosts I-IV\" is good.  That much I am sure of, and while I'm not completely sure what I think about it yet, whatever the final verdict is, he had an interesting idea that was worth exploring.\n\n\"Ghosts\" is odd not because of its large number of tracks or because it is purely instrumental, but because it is so thematic.  Despite the wide spectrum of possibilities he could have explored making an instrumental album, and his proven ability to conjure up some truly bizarre ambience (like in a lot of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Downward-Spiral\/dp\/B000001Y5Z\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Downward Spiral<\/a>), he focused almost solely on loop driven, rhythmic pieces in which most of the sound comes from guitar or piano.  For better or for worse, \"Ghosts\" is nowhere near as diverse as the instrumental work from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Fragile\/dp\/B00001P4TH\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Fragile<\/a>.\n\nAlthough others have said they find each volume of the 4 contained in \"Ghosts I-IV\" to be thematically different, I find the entire thing to be a consistent mood piece... spacious and reminiscent of a desert landscape, with forays into cool caves and shaded spaces, but always with that incredibly dry aesthetic.  The volumes only differ in the sounds added or subtracted from their palettes (for example, III has a lot more Aphex Twin-esque synth basslines).\n\nInitially many of the guitar riffs and piano arrangements seem signature Reznor, almost to the point of self parody.  However, the strength of \"Ghosts\" really lies in the careful organization and panning of sounds, the gradual swell of every track into a usually abrupt cut-off.  Despite lacking the free-form organization of true ambient music, these songs really are sound environments.  The lack of development in each track matters little when each song is a trip back to a different area of the same imaginary land...\n\n\"Ghosts I-IV\" may lack some of the intensity of previous NIN because the way it's put together prevents any kind of tension from building, but it's still full of great ideas.  I also give \"Ghosts I-IV\" a lot of credit for being a double album that I almost always listen to in one sitting, a rare thing (I don't even usually do that with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Fragile\/dp\/B00001P4TH\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Fragile<\/a>).  It flows very well and is very listenable, and it feels much shorter than it is.\n\nSo for $5, how could you go wrong?","classification":4,"fold":0}

{"text":"Canadian indie rock duo Tegan amid Sara makes the drastic jump into mainstream pop music consciousness and wonderfully too I might add. The beats are catchy and the lyrics witty as you have come to expect from the sisters. Despite what some others my say I think despite a new turn in direction the music remains the same lyrical (I did go back and listen to their discography). The lead track and single \"Closer\" set the bar pretty high for the album which the sisters wonderfully maintain. My favorites are \"Closer\" which is a wonderfully bouncy song that you can't help but like it; \"I Was a Fool\" which is a lower midtempo ballad beautifully written and sung; also \"Goodbye, Goodbye\" , \"Drove Me Wild\", and \"I Am Not Your Hero\".","classification":5,"fold":0}

{"text":"Nine Inch Nails has returned, unannounced this time, with a new album.  This one is a 36-track collection of short, instrumental pieces that have no order, no agenda and no direction.  But this is not a bad thing!  It's vintage NIN.  It's abstract art, coming from the mind of one of this era's greatest musicians.\n\nI LOVED how Trent released this album.  I wish I could've gotten the $300 version.  The presentation of this album is nothing short of immaculate.  Even if you only got the mp3 album, the presentation is a cut above your average internet purchase.  Each of the 36 songs has a different picture attached to it.  On my iPod, instead of the album cover, it shows one of these for every song.  It's little things such as this that make Trent's music so invigorating.\n\nObviously it goes without saying that this is not an album for the mainstream.  You can't just pop this in and listen to it like you would any other NIN release.  This one requires a certain degree of active listening for you to pick out the subtle nuances that Trent put into these songs.  As background noise, you won't hear much and no songs really stand out.  This is why the best way to listen to it is through headphones, while allowing your mind to fully take in the music.\n\nThis is one of the most unique releases ever.  Not for everyone, but still a masterpiece.","classification":4,"fold":0}

Roger and company never let us down on all the tracks. While many who write reviews want to tell you about the significants of each track I won't go there. You should listen and judge for yourself. The music is good, the music is fun. FUN ?!! Yes fun, it's been a long time since music was fun and still made you wanna get your groove on. That's what this disc does, as Boosty says on one of his early Funkadelic tracks.

{"text":"She is back, and never has this living legend sounded so good. Forget that the lyrics are not deep, just enjoy this awesome disc from Cher. Being in Canada, I bought the international version of Living Proof with 'You take it all' instead of 'When you walk away' last November from a local retailer. It has been in my stereo ever since! 'Real Love' 'Song for the Lonely' and 'When the money's gone' are the best of the best. High energy, fun, and radio-ready cuts to say the least. Cher has changed with the times, that is why she had such a long-standing career. Sometimes the computer effects on the tracks get to be a bit much, but I love every song nontheless. Be sure to listen to this disc from start to finish. I can honestly say that there is not one track that could be considered the 'worst' song on the album. Some are stronger than others, but each one is worthy of being a single. Cher, keep up the awesome work. Your fans want to hear more from you for years to come. Buy this cd now!","classification":5,"fold":0}

All of the songs are missing the original sound that made this album great.\n\nRemastering this album is just like someone going back and remastering the original Rage Against the Machine album that was also recorded at Sound City.\n\nIf it is PERFECT, don't screw with it!  You can't beat PERFECTION!!\n\nMusic recorded at Sound City on the very rare NEVE console using tape and actual talent are VERY FEW.

I realize whenever I see this music video, it makes me feel good, and so does this song.  Therefore, I will say it takes me back to the old days and good memories.  The beats and rhythm in the song sound like a merry-go-round would sound if music went with it.  \"Merry-go-round,\"  \"Around\" the way..\"  anyway, he is rhyming about making passes at girls while walking down the block, most likely in Jamaica, Queens where he grew up.  Flirting with ladies while they do everyday things like sucking on a \"blow pop.\"  I bought that brand lollipop all the time where I went to elementary and junior high school in Crown Heights.  The rhythm and harmonies in this song are soft, and not too hard.","classification":2,"fold":0}
{"text":"Sold through the Capitol Record Club as a \"collector\" premium, via his fan club at the time. Latest track on the Lp, \"Once More With Feeling,\" is an Lp filler from TRY A LITTLE KINDNESS Lp, which dates this set into 1970-71 or so.\n\nThis album set was packaged with a folded 24\" x 36\" poster (same photo shot as the front cover of THE GOODTIME ALBUM, Capitol SW 493, roughly August, 1970) and a copy of THE GLEN CAMPBELL SOUVENIR PICTURE BOOK, normally the brown cover version, though some of the earliest runs on this set used the previous yellow cover edition with GC in a WICHITA LINEMAN photo shot.\n\nBeware that used record dealers may split out the extra packaging--the poster and the picture book--to sell separately. This is basically a reissue of the obvious fillers, with some nice extras.","classification":2,"fold":0}

{"text":"The lyrics to this so called \"song\" are absolutely awful. The lyrics are definitely the worse part...if you actually listen to the lyrics and comprehend them you will know just how little effort and thought was put into this song. Seriously just understand the lyrics, but most people who listen to this song would not even care about lyrics in a song...what do lyrics matter in a song? This song is made for people with no music taste whatsoever. It is simply one of the most annoying, worst excuses for a song created in the year it was released.\n\nHow this singer was even on a singing competition and got past the first round makes no sense. She cannot sing. And whoever she hires to write most of her lyrics obviously can't do their job either. Why anyone would listen to this song is beyond me, they must seriously have no music taste whatsoever. If you like this song you have just proved to the world you have no taste at all...not even remotely. This song is an utter embarrassment, and most people who listen to it are kids and kids should not even listen to this song but it has very suggestive lyrics for no reason.\n\nThe song is trying to be cute but it's actually rather nasty. If you listen to the lyrics it's about a woman who is extremely easy to get into her pants, meeting a random guy and agreeing to put out just about is what the song is about, she says that she just met this guy and gives her number and this is crazy...yes, it is crazy. What kind of s word gives her phone number out to the most random guy who doesn't even ask for it? She goes up right to him and gives her number to any guy she thinks she might have a chance of having intercourse with. It's pathetic.","classification":1,"fold":0}
