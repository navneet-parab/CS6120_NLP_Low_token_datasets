It was born out of a contradiction and a paradox. \n\nThe contradiction is that while the world is growing more interdependent, the media is fragmenting -- re-nationalizing, re-localizing and even tribalizing. The resulting paradox is that the information age is becoming the age of non-communication across boundaries -- political, cultural and ideological.\n\nThe aim of The WorldPost is to help bridge this growing chasm by becoming a platform where the whole world meets; a common zone where cross-pollination of ideas and perspectives from all corners of the planet can take place.\n\nTo achieve this aim, The WorldPost strives for a global viewpoint looking around, not a national perspective looking out. Along with intelligent curation of the global news and original reportage, what distinguishes us, above all, are the first person global voices of our contributors. Every week, they weigh in as events break from Havana to Beijing, from Moscow to Mexico City, Paris, New Delhi and Abuja among so many other places.\n\nThe WorldPost seems to have met an outstanding need.

These documents show that both before and after the investigation of Sulkowicz's alleged sexual assault, Columbia has taken missteps in handling other cases, failing to adhere to federal guidance and standards.\n\nTitle IX, the federal law that mandates gender equality in education, advises sexual assault cases be fully resolved within 60 days of the initial reporting. Columbia's policy goes further, stating that investigations will take no longer than 30 days and that once the investigation is over, a hearing will wrap up a case two weeks later.\n\nAccording to university documents, Zachary's case took seven months. In another case from 2014, a transgender Columbia sophomore said xe* waited over six months for the investigation to be resolved. And, Sarah, a rising senior, filed two sexual assault cases in 2013. One took four months to resolve; the other took six.","classification":"COLLEGE","fold":9}

We should absolutely hold accountable those responsible for the recent suffering and deaths of America's veterans. But let's not stop with the VA. One reason the system is so overwhelmed is because of the tens of thousands injured in Iraq, an unnecessary war, which also claimed over 4,400 soldiers' lives. In 2003, Shinseki, then serving as Army chief of staff, testified it would take \"several hundred thousand soldiers\" to occupy Iraq. For speaking the truth about the recklessness and hubris behind the invasion, he was pushed aside by Bush, Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz.  So yes, there should be a price to pay for the unnecessary deaths of U.S. veterans -- but when will there be a price to pay for all those who were killed or are still suffering because of an unnecessary and immoral war?","classification":"POLITICS","fold":9}

{"text":"The polling averages now show Clinton up by about 13 points in Tuesday's primary. Sanders has closed gaps like this, but mainly in states that allow independents to vote in party primaries. If Clinton does pull out a win, it ends Sanders' streak and all but guarantees Clinton's nomination. If, on the other hand, Sanders should narrowly win, it doesn't mean he wins the nomination -- the two will split New York's delegates almost evenly. His path to a delegate majority would still be exceedingly steep. But a Sanders win, which would make eight out of the last nine, would reinforce the impression that he's the one with momentum. And it would put the remaining states, most notably Pennsylvania and California, seriously in play. Even with a close win for Clinton in New York, the risk for Democrats is that Clinton limps towards nomination, while the preponderance of energy and excitement are with Sanders.","classification":"POLITICS","fold":9}

The explicit purpose is to make patent protection stronger and longer. While these provisions are likely to lead to higher drug prices in the United States, they will have their greatest impact in the developing world. In most developing countries, drugs are far cheaper than in the United States. This is especially the case in India. The country has a world-class generic industry that produces high-quality drugs that typically sell for a small fraction of the price in the United States. The U.S. drug industry desperately wants to eliminate this sort of price gap, which can exceed a ratio of one hundred to one. This should have everyone very worried.","classification":"BUSINESS","fold":9}

{"text":"This week was dominated by news from Ferguson -- but much of what was really happening went untold by the media. While TV viewers were mostly presented with endless images of tear gas, violence and division, a fuller depiction would have revealed a community challenged by adversity, underrepresentation and institutional failure that responded with remarkable empathy, kindness and trust. At HuffPost, in addition to covering the protests, the failure of those sworn to serve the citizens of Ferguson, and the entrenched role of race, we also tried to shine a light on how the community came together -- cleaning up, handing out food, and raising money. There was a lot more love than looting in Ferguson, more compassion than conflict. How the media covers a crisis matters -- and showing only one side breeds cynicism about what we can become. The brave citizens of Ferguson have risen to the occasion. I hope the media will join them.","classification":"POLITICS","fold":9}
