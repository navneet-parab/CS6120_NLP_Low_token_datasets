{"text":"Evidently the title \"Simple Plan\" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, \"Time To Say Goodbye.\" It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer\/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block. This becomes all the more apparent because Britney Spears' songwriting team was brought in to write several songs, making Simple Plan sound like a boy band. Even when they try to rock out, the production is so overdone that the guitars seem distorted and out of place. And there are WAY too many piano-ballads. I think any trace of the faux-punk label they were slapped with after their first two albums, which were decent efforts packed with pop-punk hooks, can permanently be removed now. Simple Plan will spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was the three-plus year layoff between albums or the change of sound\/style on this new one that killed their career. And the answer is neither. It is the lack of originality, energy, and songcraft that will do them in. Lets face it, when Hilary Duff rocks harder than you, your band is not \"punk.\" And in the three and a half years this band was away, the scene changed, but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band calls \"unchartered musical territory.\" Perhaps \"UnCHARTED\" musical territory is more like it.

{"text":"Jewel Kilcher was always known for her meaningful lyrics and acoustic song stylings so it was no surprise that she would be labeled a \"sell-out\" once she switched things up at all. No one knows quite why Jewel decided to switch styles though many assume it was to crossover to the mainstream and sell more. Jewel's fourth album \"0304\" takes a more electronica\/dance approach than its guitar-driven predecessors though the lyrical quality is still there. The even weirder thing was that at the time of this album's release, June 2003, the big dance-pop bang from the late 90's and even 2000\/2001 was over which suggests that this wasn't exactly an attempt to ride the latest trends. Jewel was never known for doing what was trendy and this is no exception.\n\nThe album starts off with the social commentary song entitled \"Stand\". The song comments on numerous topics including policemen stealing and the mayor having no money because he spent it on \"hookers and hash\". The lyrics seem to be trying to say that we can make a stand against all these problems. Next up is the first evidence of Jewel's new style, \"Run 2 U\". Everything from the internet-style writing in the title (numbers instead of words) to the dance beat in the background takes listeners away from what they thought a Jewel song should be but to me, it still works. The song is catchy enough that it will stick in your head but still maintains Jewel's usual meaningful lyrics (\"I need you for dark reasons, for greed and lust...\"). Thirdly. We have the first single \"Intuition\" which seems to almost be a parody of the pop music scene. The lyrics are not quite as deep as people are used to from Jewel however it is one of those meaningful yet catchy songs that gives its message as it gets stuck in your head. While it is good to dance to, it still maintains the positive message of following your heart.\n\nNext is \"Leave The Lights On\" which is the first lyrically poor song on the album. I love the way Jewel's voice sounds in the verses of the songs but the lyrics leave a lot to be desired especially since we know Jewel can do much better. (\"If you want my love, you can try my love, you can't buy my love\"). It's catchy and Jewel sounds good in it, but she can do better. The song after, \"2 Find U\" reminds me of \"Standing Still\" (especially in the chorus) but that is not really a bad thing. The chorus is vocally good but lyrically weak. The verses are lyrically much better. Next is \"Fragile Heart\", another love-themed song. It is probably closest to Jewel's former style, but while it is a nice song on its own, it seems very out of place on this album. Maybe it would have sounded better on an album with more songs of a similar style.  After that is \"Doin' Fine\" which is also quite poor lyrically as well as a somewhat clichd theme (that her and her man are doing fine). This song is average at best and fails to really stand out.\n\nThen comes \"2 Become 1\", and it is quite obvious what this song is about. Lyrically, it is mediocre and could have been much better. Jewel sounds very sweet in this song and this is probably my favourite song vocally, however in the grand scheme of things it is mostly average. Next up is \"Haunted\" which is told from the point of view of a stalker (similar to Sarah Mclachlan's \"Possesion\"). This song returns to the lyrical quality that listeners expect from Jewel though vocally it reminds me of Tori Amos. It is an essentially eerie-sounding song that is bound to creep out some listeners. Afterwards is \"Sweet Temptation\" which seems like a better version of \"2 Become 1\". They both talk about the same subject however \"Sweet Temptation\" is much better both vocally and lyrically. This song is also much more catchy and memorable than \"2 Become 1\".\n\nThe next song, \"Yes U Can\" is probably one of the weakest on the album and is merely a typical dance track that nearly any singer could have done. Lyrically, it is not even up to Jewel's usual standards (\"Would you like to come along? Then shut up and sing this song\"). While it is a catchy, danceable song, it does not seem like a song that Jewel would or should be doing. \"U & Me = Love\" is no better, either vocally or lyrically. I understand that Jewel is trying to branch out to a different style however she would be better off with quality songs like \"Intuition\" and \"Stand\" than this song or the one before it. After that is \"America\", which is obviously another social commentary. Unfortunately, while I appreciate what Jewel was trying to do with this song, it did not work out too well. The lyrics are quite weak (\"The Osbournes and Anna Nicole are too freaky to tell\") and the vocals are fairly standard. Lastly is \"Becoming\" which has better lyrics but really does not stand out too much. It is not in any way bad except maybe it was poorly placed.\n\nOverall Mark: 3\/5\n\nWhile most fans were outraged when Jewel released this album, she actually has some decent dance songs that prove she's capable of other styles. This album could have been really great if Jewel had stuck with infusing meaningful lyrics to dance beats (as with \"Stand\" and \"Intuition\"). Unfortunately, towards the second half of the album, Jewel ends up using mediocre lyrics that any dance artist could have done. Up until \"Fragile Heart\", the album was exceptionally well done for what it was supposed to be (meaningful dance music) though it faltered in a lot of places after that. Generally though, it is a pretty good dance album and much catchier than anything Jewel's done before.","classification":3,"fold":6}
{"text":"Ludacris was once a pre-eminent rapper who could easily score a multiplatinum album. Like many rappers, he had a powerful run with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Chicken-N-Beer\/dp\/B0000AQS1A\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Chicken N Beer<\/a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Red-Light-District\/dp\/B00065JTAQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Red Light District<\/a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Release-Therapy\/dp\/B000H30MYY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Release Therapy<\/a>&nbsp;all reaching the \"number one spot\" (no pun intended) and going platinum or better.  2008's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Theater-of-the-Mind\/dp\/B001EUSYE4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Theater of the Mind<\/a>&nbsp;marked a high spot critically in the rapper's career, but a #5 opening (still respectable) and a slept on album resulted, only being certified gold.  The album, in my opinion was better round than Ludacris's Grammy winning 'Release Therapy', but didn't spark the hits of 'Release Therapy' (\"Money Maker\" and \"Runaway Love\" namely).  'Battle of the Sexes' already has a better advantage over its predecessor with the top ten hit single \"How Low\" returning Ludacris to the nastiness, yet addictiveness of singles such as \"Splash Waterfalls\" or the anthemic nature of \"Stand Up\".  Maybe if it were say Common (who made a huge faux pas with 2008's dreadful 'Universal Mind Control') trying to be more commercial it would be a big deal, but we expect Ludacris to be, well \"ludicrous\".  'Battle of the Sexes' is indulgent, but it comes over as more enjoyable than 'Theater of the Mind' because it settles for a cheaper, immature image.  Not my favorite Ludacris albums, but maybe it is that transitional efforts to buy back fans who didn't show up for his last album.\n\nThe album opens up with a forgettable intro, but \"brings the heat\" with \"How Low\", one of the strongest cuts from the album.  Nasty, over-sexualized, yet captivating,  it is no wonder why \"How Low\" has quickly ascended to the top of the charts and had more staying power opposed to singles \"What Them Girls Want\" or \"One More Drink\" from 'Theater of the Mind.'  He keeps up the pace, as provocative as ever with the catchy \"My Chick Bad\", featuring female rap standout Nicki Minaj. \"Everybody Drunk\" featuring Lil Scrappy deviates from the sexual overtones of \"How Low\" and \"My Chick Bad\", though it is slightly less enjoyable - still a standout.  After this, \"I Do It All Night\" is solid enough, but not nearly as potent as the first three cuts.  The Trey Song featured \"Sex Room\" in all its freakiness makes up for any lack of inspiration or 'ear candy.'\n\n\"Hey H*\" (feat. Lil Kim) and \"Party No Mo'\" (feat. Gucci Mane) are solid, but not necessarily stellar.  \"B.O.T.S.\" (feat. I-20) finds a similar fate, though the soulful well produced duet with Monica \"Can't Live With You\" is one of my personal favorites.  Monica sounds better than ever.  \"Feeling So Sexy\" and \"Tell Me A Secret\" (feat. Ne-Yo) are ok, but forgettable.  \"My Chick Bad {Remix]\" featuring an all star collaborative crew (Diamond, Eve, Trina) and \"Sexting\" are excellent closers to an album that is solid enough, though inconsistent in overall conception.\n\nWhile I wouldn't go as far to call this effort 'unexceptional', 'Battle of the Sexes' lacks the maturity of 'Release Therapy' (there is no \"Runaway Love\") and the well-rounded edge of 'Theater of the Mind'.  It is what it is.  Enjoyable, though not earth-shattering by any means.  3 stars.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"When reviewing this album, I try to keep in mind that Cher Lloyd was a teenager when much of this was recorded. As such, she frequently slips into full brat mode, dropping \"f\" bombs in a thick accent, channeling her inner \"Lady Sovereign.\" But this is not really a rap or hip-hop album; much of it was composed by the likes of Shellback, Max Martin, Matt Squire, and other professional songwriters that have had pop hits with other artists such as Ke$ha, Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, etc.\n\nAs a result, the album sounds good, but you have heard all of these songs before in some other form. The sound is big, glossy, bombastic, over the top, and Lloyd is certainly to have a massive hit single. The cheesy album cover art doesn't help, with Lloyd sitting in a bathtub, tattoos exposed, phone in hand, smoke in her mouth. There are several other pictures of her with smoke in her mouth in the liner notes, and that comes off as if she is desperate to appeal to a certain demographic. The songs are, for the most part, good, although they border on being cliche. The opener \"Just Be Mine\" rips off the band \"Sleigh Bells,\" the track \"Dirty Love\" is a faster version of \"Til the World Ends\" by Britney Spears. Not surprising considering the same people wrote both songs. As pop albums go, this is a decent, refreshing outing, but not much of a step forward. Lloyd is certainly capable of doing more, from an artistic standpoint, and remember she is only 20. Over a dozen professional songwriters had their hands in this project, and while it is a decent effort, Lloyd would benefit in the future from developing a sound that is more of her own. 3.5 stars.","classification":3,"fold":6}

Don't get me wrong, I love Patsy Cline as much as anyone among the many 4- and 5-star reviewers so far, and I really regret breaking the string of assessments. But the fact is, there are many, many more superior compilations available now than this MCA release from 1988 which re-issues an earlier vinyl LP produced by Owen Bradley.\n\nFor a few dollars more you can pick up one which has all 19 of her Country hit singles registered between 1957 and 1982, the last ten posthumously following her death in that March 1963 plane crash.\n\nAlso, like far too many of the early compilations, they chose NOT to give us the original version of her first hit for Decca in 1957, Walkin' After Midnight. That version went for 2:30 and reached # 2 Country\/# 12 Billboard Pop Top 100 in May. What they give you here was a re-recording done in August 1961, shorter by almost 30 seconds and performed at a slightly faster tempo.\n\nThe rest are all originals although, technically, tracks 7, 10, and 11 were not among her \"12 greatest hits\" which is, after all, the title of this album. Back In Baby's Arms was the uncharted B-side of Sweet Dreams (Of You), Why Can't He Be You? was the uncharted flip of Heartaches which, not included here, made it to # 73 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in 1962 (but failed to make the Country charts - go figure), and You're Stronger Than Me was the uncharted flip of So Wrong in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Heartaches, legitimate hits left off this volume were the B-side to Walkin' After Midnight - A Poor Man's Roses, Or A Rich Man's Gold [# 14 Country] - the double-sided 1962 hit When I Get Thru (You'll Love Me Too)\/Imagine That which reached # 10 Country\/# 53 Hot 100 and # 21 Country\/# 90 Hot 100 respectively, When You Need A Laugh [# 47 Country in 1964], and He Called Me Baby [# 23 Country in December 1964 and her first immediate posthumous hit].\n\nIn 1969 her rendition of the old Eddy Arnold hit, Anytime, reached # 73 Country, followed nine years later by Life's Railway To Heaven which topped out at # 98. Two years after that, in 1980, a release of her cut of the old standard Always went all the way to # 18, followed in December by a re-mix of I Fall To Pieces [# 61]. In late 1981 her duet with Jim Reeves on Have You Ever Been Lonely (Have You Ever Been Blue?] soared all the way to # 5, and in 1982 yet another version of I Fall To Pieces, this time dubbing her voice with that of Jim Reeves, was a # 54.\n\nWith the insert you do get two pages of background notes written by Jay Orr and Don Roy, a chronology of Patsy's all-too-brief life, and a list of session personnel involved on each of the 12 tracks. But while these features and the AAD sound reproduction makes this a nice, inexpensive, sampling of Patsy, MCA can easily turn it into a 5-star offering by simply following the lead of others who re-released earlier 10- and 12-track CDs [Elvis, Donovan, Sarah Vaughan as examples] with bonus tracks.","classification":3,"fold":6}

The song after, \"2 Find U\" reminds me of \"Standing Still\" (especially in the chorus) but that is not really a bad thing. The chorus is vocally good but lyrically weak. The verses are lyrically much better. Next is \"Fragile Heart\", another love-themed song. It is probably closest to Jewel's former style, but while it is a nice song on its own, it seems very out of place on this album. Maybe it would have sounded better on an album with more songs of a similar style.  After that is \"Doin' Fine\" which is also quite poor lyrically as well as a somewhat clichd theme (that her and her man are doing fine). This song is average at best and fails to really stand out.\n\nThen comes \"2 Become 1\", and it is quite obvious what this song is about. Lyrically, it is mediocre and could have been much better. Jewel sounds very sweet in this song and this is probably my favourite song vocally, however in the grand scheme of things it is mostly average. Next up is \"Haunted\" which is told from the point of view of a stalker (similar to Sarah Mclachlan's \"Possesion\"). This song returns to the lyrical quality that listeners expect from Jewel though vocally it reminds me of Tori Amos. It is an essentially eerie-sounding song that is bound to creep out some listeners. Afterwards is \"Sweet Temptation\" which seems like a better version of \"2 Become 1\". They both talk about the same subject however \"Sweet Temptation\" is much better both vocally and lyrically. This song is also much more catchy and memorable than \"2 Become 1\".\n\nThe next song, \"Yes U Can\" is probably one of the weakest on the album and is merely a typical dance track that nearly any singer could have done. Lyrically, it is not even up to Jewel's usual standards (\"Would you like to come along? Then shut up and sing this song\"). While it is a catchy, danceable song, it does not seem like a song that Jewel would or should be doing. \"U & Me = Love\" is no better, either vocally or lyrically. I understand that Jewel is trying to branch out to a different style however she would be better off with quality songs like \"Intuition\" and \"Stand\" than this song or the one before it. After that is \"America\", which is obviously another social commentary. Unfortunately, while I appreciate what Jewel was trying to do with this song, it did not work out too well. The lyrics are quite weak (\"The Osbournes and Anna Nicole are too freaky to tell\") and the vocals are fairly standard. Lastly is \"Becoming\" which has better lyrics but really does not stand out too much. It is not in any way bad except maybe it was poorly placed.\n\nOverall Mark: 3\/5\n\nWhile most fans were outraged when Jewel released this album, she actually has some decent dance songs that prove she's capable of other styles. This album could have been really great if Jewel had stuck with infusing meaningful lyrics to dance beats (as with \"Stand\" and \"Intuition\"). Unfortunately, towards the second half of the album, Jewel ends up using mediocre lyrics that any dance artist could have done. Up until \"Fragile Heart\", the album was exceptionally well done for what it was supposed to be (meaningful dance music) though it faltered in a lot of places after that. Generally though, it is a pretty good dance album and much catchier than anything Jewel's done before.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"VERY disappointed! :( As a lifelong Pink Floyd fan who has all their albums, DVDs, etc; I was hopeful that this would pick up where Division Bell left off...The artwork is very cool and the overall package is excellent as one would expect with a Pink Floyd offering. Sadly the 'music' is woefully disjointed and lacking inspiration, direction or even a theme, it really doesn't sound like Pink Floyd. I was hoping for a crowning achievement, their magnum opus; and instead, I just don't know.. I feel like I have lost a dear old friend, and the last time I saw them I barely recognized them - so I guess if you measure it that way, it's a success; but it's not something I will be playing again. :(","classification":1,"fold":6}

A young boy's mother sending over thing to this lonely old man. A young boy sitting on the porch swing listening to the wisdom that his friend has earned. Passing on the wisdom he learn from reading the bible; \"the words written in red\" was mentioned. Some versions of the bible had Jesus's words printed in red, so the bible reader knew who was speaking. This old man said to the boy, he would see his wife and child soon. He also said as he aged he drew more strengh from the words written in red.  He didn't believe that life ended in a slow ride in a hearse.  He knew of a place that Jesus said he would prepare for his followers who remain faithful a place where his own wife and child were already there.\n\nThen the Boy grows up and he is in college, his Mom and he were talking about the thing happening in the small town he grew up in. Finally she tells her son that the old man who was his best friend had died.\n\nLater in bed that night he says to himself, he didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

{"text":"This MP3 set brings together two songs each from five bands on the National Geographic label. If you didn't know National Geographic had a label, get in line. I'm sure there are plenty of us out there. But judging by this sampler, they are doing some good stuff -- except for the first track, which in my view is really pretty bad.\n\nThe main nit I would pick is that the label seems to be positioning itself in \"world music\", but the bands here are all strictly rich-world groups -- based in places like Paris, New York or Madrid. No Africa- or South America-based music here. That being said, the bands here are all good at bringing a fusion of \"world music\" sensibilities with US or European tastes and production values.\n\nThe first two songs are from Bibi Tanga and the Selenites, who are based in Paris, although Bibi Tanga is from Bangui in the Central African Republic. The band says of itself that it is attracted to \"groove in all its shapes\". But judging by the first track, some shapes might be better left alone. It sounded, to my admittedly old-fashioned tastes, like a bad disco nightmare, a bad Rick James knockoff, sung in a falsetto &agrave; la Eddie Murphy's \"Roxanne\" in \"48 Hours\". The second track is a great improvement -- the falsetto is still there, but it works much better.\n\nThe second two tracks are by DePedro, a Madrid-based band -- which you can hear in their in their Spanish accents when they sing. For my tastes, these are the best songs on the collection. The first, \"Comanche\" has great slide guitar riffs and a funky rhythm, while the second is good laid back track with xylophone and a banjo riff to kick off. The band's lyrics are really pretty good and add to the music.\n\nNext up, Grupo Fantasma is a US-based Latin orchestra that gets good reviews for its tight arrangements and playing. The sound has a modernized Latin orchestral sound with strong guitars giving an American feel. A little like Tito Puente meets Santana. Very nice stuff.\n\nBalkan Beat Box is a New York-based band that also has roots in Tel Aviv. It was founded by Tamir Muskat, formerly of Gogol Bordello, and Ori Kaplan, formerly of Firewater and bringing a background in klezmer clarinet. MC Tomer Yosef is also key to the sound. Their music is sometimes called gypsy punk, and there is a definite Balkan\/gypsy feeling. But there are strong dance beats and rapping, as well as influences from around the Mediterranean. This is club music with a more inclusive and informed musical sensibility than a lot of the other stuff out there. Not my cup of tea, but for its genre it seems a cut above.\n\nThe set closes out with two tracks from Forro in the Dark, a group of Brazilians who got together to make music in New York. The music has a lot of Brazilian-inspired, but Americanized rhythms. I enjoyed the cuts here. David Byrne has recorded with them, so they have certainly reached a certain level of street cred. The first cut is a rocker, relatively speaking, and the second a rousing instrumental with a flute lead.\n\nOverall this music is definitely worth a listen. I might even consider buying something by DePedro later on. I wouldn't be surprised to hear that a lot of people with different tastes and interests than mine are inspired to check out the other bands here. Good stuff!","classification":5,"fold":6}

So what to do??  Get the new version, keep the slipcase, make the case a triple, and cut out the lyrics\/info from the old booklet and put inside the new one, use the other case for another disc that needs a new one...broken\/scratched\/worn-out marks.

{"text":"The California trio Dilated Peoples got off to a rocky start earlier in their career. Originally signed to Immortal\/Epic Records, they were planning to release their debut in 1995- that is, until it got shelved by the label. They went to the indie label ABB Records and released a few 12 inch singles here and there, while group member Evidence produced one-third of Defari's 1998 debut \"Focused Daily\". They raised their profile by appearing on the Gold-selling Rawkus compilation \"Soundbombing II\". That appearance led to them being signed to Capitol Records where in 2000, they released their formal debut- the critically acclaimed \"The Platform\". 2001 saw the release of their sophomore effort \"Expansion Team\" and three years later, followed the somewhat commercial \"Neighborhood Watch\". In 2006, they released what became their final album for Capitol, \"20\/20\". In 2007, Evidence released his solo debut \"The Weatherman LP\", while Rakaa released \"Crown Of Thorns\" a few years later. Within that time, the group's future was up in the air- even amongst the members themselves. Things started to change when Evidence signed with Rhymesayers to release \"Cats & Dogs\". Not only did the label sign him, but also the group- and so began the journey into their first album in nearly a decade, \"Directors Of Photography\".\n\nWhile most of Dilated Peoples' albums were helmed primarily by Evidence and The Alchemist, this time around their production contributions amount to very little. Evidence produces the title track, the Vince Staples assisted \"The Dark Room\" and two interludes, while The Alchemist oversees the Sick Jacken featured \"L.A. River Drive\" and the track recalling their formative years in their hometowns \"Cut My Teeth\". DJ Babu produces three songs: the bass heavy scratch track \"Figure It Out (Melvin's Theme)\", \"The Reversal\" and Opinions May Vary\". On \"Directors Of Photography\", they reunite with DJ Premier on the first single \"Good As Gone\", while getting production help from D.I.T.C. member Diamond D. on the search for serenity \"Let Your Thoughts Fly Away\". Madlib's younger brother Oh No produces \"Century Of The Self\", with 9th Wonder overseeing the closing track \"The Bigger Picture\" featuring Strong Arm Steady member Krondon. Though most of the album is clearly geared towards the underground, the Aloe Blacc featured \"Show Me The Way\" sounds like it was meant to become a radio hit. \"Directors Of Photography\" is another great album from Dilated Peoples. They may been gone for eight years, but they haven't missed a step- and that's a good thing.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Just in time for the holiday season, the Bach Guild's latest release returns to the Baroque era. This is their third Baroque compilation (I know, it says Vol III right on the box, so that much is obvious...) and this time they have included a very interesting selection of works from no less than 30 different composers, some of which were completely new to me personally, others well-known 'war horses' (and a few who would normally be considered to be outside of the 'baroque' period, but that is a minor quibble). Eight hours and nineteen minutes altogether, on 129 tracks.\n\nDuplications with previous Bach Guild releases are few; here is what I am aware of so far:\n- Bach cantatas (tracks 114-116) were also included with the Big Christmas Box\n- Purcell's Abdelazer Suite (tracks 34-42) was also included with the Big Baroque Box I\n\nSome performance notes for a couple of the pieces that I've listened to so far:\n\n- Vivaldi's Concerto for Violin in G Minor, No. 1 in G minor, RV 317, here performed by the Vienna State Opera Orchestra Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Vladimir Golschmann, with violinist Mischa Elman, compares very well to my other recording of this work, by Pavlo Beznosiuk on violin and with Christopher Hogwood conducting the Academy of Ancient Music (on Amazon search for ASIN B004I7MCHA, Vivaldi Masterworks).\n\n- The very familiar and beloved Bach Violin Concerto in E Major, BWV 1042, also performed here by Vienna State Opera Orchestra Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Vladimir Golschmann, with violinist Mischa Elman is not one that I will frankly find myself returning to again, but for someone who does not yet have a performance in their collection, it will serve as a placeholder until one of the many better performances is acquired (for example, consider Andrew Manze, violin and conducting the Academy of Ancient Music (on Amazon search for ASIN B00000IL4A, or Simon Standage, with Trevor Pinnock conducting the English Concert, ASIN B00000E2NY or with the newer collection B00004SAAY).\n\nOther notable and interesting works include, for example and as John Van Note has already mentioned in his review, the Soler Concertos Nos. 1 through 6 for two obbligato (keyboards) performed by Anton Heiller (organ and harpsichord) and Erna Heiller (harpsichord), fascinating and enjoyable music and very well performed and recorded here, along with the various sounds and noises that go along with such playing. Close your eyes and you can imagine yourself in an 18th century parlour, in Vienna or Salzburg - or perhaps I should say Madrid or Barcelona, since Soler was born in Spain and I do not know how much time he might have spent in Austria or elsewhere during his lifetime.\n\nI do feel that a couple of corrections are needed regarding the track labeling for this collection. Tracks 93-95 are identified as C.P.E. Bach: Concerto for Orchestra in D Major, however I think that this performance is actually the Sinfonia Concertante in D Major by Johann Christian Bach. Track 80 is identified as Archangelo Torelli: Concerto in D Minor, Op. 6, No. 10, however I believe this is actually by the composer Giuseppe Torelli. There may be some others I have not yet caught. Please comment to my review if you disagree or have any other notes to add, and I'll keep this listing as up to date and accurate as possible.\n\nFinally, below is a complete listing of the contents, along with performers and links to previous releases. In most cases I have so far been unable to determine date or venue of the performances included in this collection, but as I am able to find that information I will update this review to include that information:\n\nTracks 1-10:\n- Antonio Vivaldi: \"L'Estro Armonico\", Op. 3, Concerto No. 11 in D minor for two violins, cello and strings, RV 565\n- Arcangelo Corelli: Concerto Grosso, Op. 6 No. 8, in G minor \"Christmas Concerto\"\n\nPerformances by The Leopold Stokowski Orchestra, conducted by Leopold Stokowski, with pianist Igor Kipnis (separately released on Vanguard CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Vivaldi-J-S-Bach-Corelli-Mozart\/dp\/B0000023EJ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Vivaldi \/ J.

{"text":"When I first heard about this song, I thought it was simply a gimmick by the band to score points with the comic-book-nerd crowd, or a goofy fan project by the band.  Why else would someone make a song about Superman, of all things?  Not that a song about a comic-book character can't be good -- it just seemed like a weird concept to me.  So when I finally heard the song on the radio, I was rather shocked.  Rather than being the goofy novelty song I was expecting, it turned out to be wistful and even sad.  Was I even listening to the right song?\n\nNow I've fallen in love with the song, and it's introduced me to other fantastic numbers by Five For Fighting.  Though \"Superman\" will always be my favorite song of theirs.\n\n\"Superman (It's Not Easy)\" never refers to the titular hero by name in its lyrics, but its references are quite obvious -- it paraphrases the infamous \"It's a bird!  It's a plane!\" catchphrase in \"I'm more than a bird\/I'm more than a plane,\" and makes references to \"a silly red sheet\" and \"digging for Kryptonite on this one-way street.\"  And it takes what has long been a heroic but flat character and gives him a more tragic side, showing how difficult it is to be a hero, and reminisces about how even an icon such as the Man of Steel has his own dreams, fears, and grief, and \"even heroes have the right to bleed.\"  One can easily apply this \"darker side\" to other classic heroes and figures, of course, but naturally this song is Superman's only.\n\nThe music is quite lovely as well, a wistful guitar and piano number that's never intense but always thoughtful and contemplative, with John Ondrasik providing vocals that are heartfelt but never over-the-top.  Drums are used at points of the song, but they're very understated and never overtake the music.\n\nThis is a lovely number I'd recommend to everybody, but is especially poignant to the comic-book fan who is familiar with Superman and wants to see another side to the Man of Steel.  Even heroes, after all, have the right to bleed, dream, and cry.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I remember first hearing this quality tune Black Velvet by Alannah Myles around the time I was 9-10 years old.  The song was played on local radio and I remember the song being performed at a carnival that was being held near the city that I lived in at the time (I just wish that I could remember if it was Alannah Myles and her group or if the performance was by a tribute band). Anyhow, the vocals and the lyrics of the  song musically paint a story that would make for good tv episode viewing or a movie about a heartbreaker who is easy on the eyes or maybe not conventionally attractive but a charmer.  Either way a person has to be open-minded to listen to this gem of a song due to the fact that the song appears to be about a womanizer who is easy on the eyes, maybe even pleasant to be around (I.e. a charmer) yet hard on a persons heart romantically speaking. Im also keeping a record of this song as one of the multiple tunes I remember from my childhood.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"This album is just as over-the-top awesome as the cover suggests, and I absolutely love it! Muse are a band who write meaningful songs about important subjects, yet aren't afraid to add some silliness in there occasionally. This album's subject matter is very serious indeed, but the generous dose of lighthearted fun Muse has sprinkled it with saves Drones from being too dark.\n\nDrones includes many of the same elements that have defined Muse's unique and epic sound over the years, while at the same time being fresh and original and unlike anything the band has ever done before. The album starts off with what some might call a \"generic Muse song\", and ends with what is by far their least \"generic\" song ever. This album is pretty \"out there\", and I mean that in the best way possible. There are so many genres packed into this album--including everything from pop-rock to metal to classical opera to punk rock to acapella Gregorian chants! But Muse makes it all work together wonderfully, and distills all these diverse musical influences into something truly amazing. It may take a few listens to fully appreciate, but this release is something special. Muse are a band who aren't afraid to take risks and change things up from album to album, and that is one of the qualities that I think makes them such a great band. Despite what Pitchfork and various hipster critics might say, this album is another well-crafted and enjoyable release from Muse that will stand the test of time. Finally, I gotta say--if Radiohead released this album, it would probably be heralded by critics as a masterpiece (and in saying that I mean no insult to Radiohead, as I am a huge Radiohead fan).","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"It is honestly so sad that whenever someone young and talented has died at a early age. The shock of the death of Pete Burns has been deviating, but not a real surprised. He really was one of the most driven artists that had been more known as a one-hit wonder, than having massive success beyond the 80's. But also, his death was from the years of drugs and plastic surgery and him becoming a transvestite, becoming a man and being a woman at the end of the day. But nevertheless, he will always be known for just one song. That is how his friends and fans want to remember him and Dead Or Alive. You Spin Me Round (Like A Record) remains one of the most driven anthems to have ever came out of the 80's, in excess but also at heart as well. It has been one of those songs worthwhile at spirit, but also shows just how strong the 80's anthems ignite today, more than almost all of the artists that have ever came out with a album. But anyway, this is how Pete Burns should be remembered, as a fad, but as a strong example of what music was like in the era of excess.\n\nSong: B\n\nPete Burns  1959-2016","classification":4,"fold":6}

However I had to hunt and settle for buying this one on iTunes in order to have it before a large 2,000+ event at a college with a large Korean student population.\n\nAs far as the song - I like it, but it won't have the lasting power of the Cupid Shuffle, Cha-Cha Slide, and the more recent Wobble unfortunately. I already see it dying. I'm happy to see a K-Pop song with a (fairly) positive message getting so much attention, and Psy really deserves it as an artist. This is a better satire than Right Said Fred's 'I'm Too Sexy', though it basically has the same message.

{"text":"I think the reviewer who calls this Brahms Fourth a dud is overstating the case. Szell never falls below the high standard of execution that made the Cleveland Orch. world class, so ensemble and balances are perfect. But for some reason he seems dispirited. The opening movement, whose first theme sounds disjointed here, doesn't soar: it's just one note after the other. This literalness is even more apparent in the slow movement, which seems to be sleepwalking.\n\nI was shocked, given that Szell generally followed Toscanini's model in Brahms, which is swift and tense. The Scherzo catches a spark or two, but the phrasing remains foursquare rather than flowing or exciting. When the finale arrived and I heard the opening bars played with every chord at the same volume, with no attempt to express the shape of Brahms's great passacaglia, I gave up. From college I remember Szell's Academic Festival Over. being one of the best, and it has more sprightly energy than the symphony by a long shot; recording and inner detail are marvelous also. But you'd never guess that Brahms had written a celebratory piece. Likewise, the Tragic Over., which is the best thing on this budget CD, is forceful and well recorded but short on real tragedy.\n\nIn all, this is the least successful installment in Szell's Brahms cycle, which includes a riveting First and Third.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"This is a very unusual album, due mostly, I believe, to the talents of Ryan Tedder, who is responsible for the vocals and the bulk of the writing, producing and arranging, as well as playing piano and other instruments. The result is an album that has solid beats and bright, structured production to ensure pop success, but also features diverse, sometimes complex arrangements, with many of the tracks including melodic piano and strings combined with heavy percussion. This is important because it gives the album a quality which makes it a cut above the ordinary pop album, a sound which is, at times, almost symphonic.\n\nFor example, the first track, \"Made For You\", begins with soft drums and piano, then the vocals come in backed by heavier percussion, then later there is an interlude of only vocals and strings, then there is chanting of \"All the right friends in all the right places\", which are actually lyrics from the second track, which opens with a choir singing those lyrics. Got that? \"Missing Persons 1 & 2\" is, as the title suggests, actually 2 songs, connected by a short bridge of electronic sound. \"Waking Up\" begins with a vocal backed by a church-organ sound, then quickly turns harder, featuring chiming guitar reminiscent of U2. If fact, this track reminds me of U2's \"Joshua Tree\" period, except that it changes again at the end to a peaceful instrumental of piano and strings.  \"Marchin On\" does indeed have the beat and rousing quality of a march, but even this track contains a softer interlude.\n\nAnd there's more. \"Good Life\" is a very positive, happy song which has as its background an 80's-90's synthesizer sound; this is what attracted me to the album in the first place. \"Everybody Loves Me\" (another of my favorites) is a rock track with bluesy guitar and a sort of \"talking\" vocal. Ryan really frees his soul on this one! \"Fear\" is a beautiful ballad introduced by stacatto strings, then piano. \"Lullaby\" really does sound like a lullaby - hypnotic, comforting. In general, the lyrics are personal enough to relate to but abstract enough to appeal to the general pop audience. Ryan Tedder's voice is high-pitched and goes frequently into falsetto, which fits the arrangements and material. A deep voice would not enhance the aura of musicality and vague spirituality that is part of the album's charm.\n\nEven more amazing is the fact that all this creative diversity is contained in an album that is slightly under 48 minutes long. That is remarkable in itself, but it  makes me wonder what Mr. Tedder could accomplish if he set out to write an opera or perhaps a standard full-length symphony.","classification":5,"fold":6}

With her return on Closer To The Truth, Cher has been away from Hollywood for awhile, but nevertheless she still has a hunger for being a sultry singer. I Hope You Find It, the second single from her album is definitely a good return to form in her voice and absolute spirit. It is a good ballad that can rank high with her classics like Just Like Jesse James and If I Could Turn Back Time. It is honestly a better song than what Cher had with A Woman's World when that was a single late last year. If you are new to Cher's music, in a  world filled with manufactured divas like Katy Perry & Rihanna, maybe they should take a second look at what Cher has been able to do for nearly 50 years.\n\nSong: B 1\/2-","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Showing more spunk than would be expected after a seven year hiatus, \"Glad All Over\" finds The Wallflowers rocking harder than probably any of their previous albums. Especially after the neo-folk of Jakob Dylan's pair of solo cd's, this is an unexpected surprise and delight. Adding to the jet fuel is drummer Jack Irons (late of the Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Mick Jones guesting on two rather Clash like songs. \"Glad All Over\" is shaking all around with a triumphant feeling.\n\n\"Reboot The Mission\" they snap on the best song here. With Jones adding back-up vocals, it's Casbah pleasing rock. That's not all the band has up their sleeve, though. The frantic opener \"Hospital for Sinners\" sounds wickedly fun, even a little sinister. Same with the piano pounding \"Devil's Waltz.\" If you're looking for the \"One Headlight\" clone, the closest it the disc's closer \"One Set of Wings.\" But this is an album that punches harder than the old songs.

{"text":"Fresh off of an eleven-year-long hiatus, Ratt finally returned with their seventh full-length album in 2010. Taking said hiatus was a really risky move on the band's part because it surely made quite a few of their fans lose interest. (But, fortunately, \"Infestation\" did prove to be very popular, as it debuted at #30, thus making it the highest-charting Ratt record since 1990.) And plus, when Ratt finally did return, they would have a lot of work to do to show the world that they can still shred as mightily as ever. But Warren DeMartini and Carlos Cavazo effortlessly prove that fact without question. It is filled with delicious dual-guitar shredding, including tasty licks and infectious leads. And plus, there isn't one solo on tap, here, that is not worth hearing at least once.\n\n\"Eat Me Up Alive\" is a heavy set opener with meaty, driving, hard-rocking riffs that evoke Judas Priest's Eighties era. But the tune is particularly of note for featuring one of Ratt's all-time best and most infectious choruses. And, of course, some really excellent and memorable, trade-off guitar solos are tucked into the mix, here, as well. \"Best Of Me\" boasts some especially melodic guitar work, including melodic riffing, soaring guitar harmonies, and a dazzling, acrobatically winding solo. And the song's catchy, sing-songy choruses are the icing on the cake. Later tracks, such as \"A Little Too Much\" and \"Last Call\" (which features a strong, pronounced, dirty\/grungy-sounding bass line) have guitar leads that dip into Motorhead-like blues-metal territory. And they are, naturally, both complete with catchy, arena-sized choruses, too. But these two tunes are offset by \"Look Out Below,\" which is perhaps the record's heaviest moment, with its heavy, driving main riff backed up by fiery, shredding guitar soloing (including one especially ripping solo that brings to mind Priest's \"Painkiller\" days).\n\n\"Lost Weekend\" is another huge standout, and it stands out for being a hit-single-worthy number, and one that is filled with fiery, crunchy, chugga-chugga riffing and anthemic, arena-sized vocal refrains. Elsewhere, the delicious guitar shredding in \"As Good As It Gets\" ultimately comes across sounding like a cross between Rush, Queensryche, Van Halen, and Def Leppard; and \"Garden Of Eden\" has big, hefty, hard rockin' Black Sabbath riffs counteracted by a soaring melodic solo. There are two other pleasant surprises found later on, too, in the form of \"Take A Big Bite\" and \"Don't Let Go,\" as they are both unexpectedly blistering bursts of speed metal with ripping, piercing, Priest-y  soloing. And sandwiched between these two tracks is track ten, \"Take Me Home,\" an epic power ballad that is partially acoustic, and entirely cleanly sung. It is also highlighted by a really lengthy, epically wailing, melodic guitar solo section that lasts roughly a minute.\n\nAll in all, \"Infestation\" might not break much new ground for the band, but it is, ultimately, the best album Ratt have released this side of the 1980's. It is a quality piece of hair metal, I tell you what; and definitely one that should satisfy the band's fan base, no matter how large and rabid it may be. So, then again, it might be wise of the band to stick to the sound that got them famous in the first place.","classification":4,"fold":6}

We travel the roads from the suburbs of the South hearing the testimony and struggle that emerged Midwest.  Alex and Dre give voice to the disparity and racial stereotypes shared by the inhabitants of their hometowns.  As far as the album's length is concerned.  Which can be a hit or miss in this situation.  Southern Light clocks in under 43 minutes.\n\n  Alex and Dre paid dues to be where they are in Christian and HIp Hop worlds.  Unwavering in their commitment to make meaningful music and sharing the Gospel.  Both are disciplined in their storytelling ability.  Reminiscent of Outkast, the way they share roles, and spit on solo outings.  Guest features from Sean C. Johnson, ADA-L, add their passion and artistic merit on the album.  They contributions are not to be missed.  You will also get insightful lyricism, chants\/hooks and raw energy from Young Noah, Tragic Hero  and Corey Paul.  Because of the length of the album you'll repeat most of these songs anyway.  The guitars, keyboard synths, beat elements are blended professionally and should be noted. There's no denying the stomping ground our boys call home.  My definitive favorite tracks  are Wake Up Music, Overexposed,  All Around The World, Money, Taking Time, and City of Nightmares II.  This remastered or remixed version of Decatur Street Blues doesn't hype me up as much as  the single did.  I get the feeling that both artists held back something.  Perhaps a track with all fellow Ws Live As Kings bandmates was a pretty tall order to fill.\n\nIn summation,  you should definitely check out Southern Lights.  This record sheds light in the dark places that Alex and Dre have tread.  These two illuminate the light of Christ without fail.  I'm definitely keeping my ears further open to the music that Collision Records have planned.  Thank you Alex Faith and Dre Murray.  God bless you both.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"When The Beatles split up for good back in 1970 I wondered what in the world would become of George. While I enjoyed much of his work as lead guitarist with The Beatles I was really not too sure that he could make it as a solo artist. My doubts were quickly dispelled in the late fall of 1970 when Harrison released his epic 3 LP set \"All Things Must Pass\". George Harrison's debut LP as a solo act was an immediate smash. In the years that followed I found that much to my surprise George's work as a solo artist was by far the most interesting to me of all of the Fab Four.  One of my very favorite Harrison tunes was his 1987 cover version of James Ray's 1962 hit \"I've Got My Mind Set On You\".  Much to everyone's surprise the release would become George Harrison's last #1 record.  I think it is fair to say that in this case the re-make is much better than the original.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Whether it's by kicking a female fan at one of his concerts or admitting he's sleeping with his cousin, Baton Rouge rapper and Atlantic Records artist Kevin Gates (Kevin Gilyard) sure knows how to make himself look like a douchebag in the public eye. And for those two revelations to surface close to the release of Islah, his debut studio album, means an even more severe blow has been dealt to his likability and career-longevity. Gates has released several mixtapes since 2006, worked with many notables in the game and was inducted into XXL's 2014 Freshmen Class, something the popular hip-hop magazine might be regretting now. Islah (released Jan. 29) is just what you'd expect from Gates and nothing more, as he positions himself comfortably in the dual role of gangster and lover in this precisely unimpressive first major label LP of his.\n\nIslah actually starts off decently, but it doesn't last long. Gates holds hip-hop's pupils' attention for the entirety of the first song, \"Not The Only One,\" with its ordinary but nice low-key beat and the good kindhearted intentions of its contents, and Gates also has some solid flows in there, but after track's end, the ADD is likely to flare up for wildly anxious listeners. All of the rest of the album proceeds in the exact same predictable way, showcasing Gates as either a hard product of the trap or an experienced romantic, and he takes really no chances anywhere.\n\n\"Really Really\" and \"Two Phones\" attempt to establish authenticity and rally up support for Gates's cause and brand, and \"Pride\" shows his softer side as he misses his ex-girlfriend and carries on in that way. He then goes back and forth between the streets and his relationships, song for song between the hood and his love life, the ghetto and the game of love. This two-way structure is pretty obvious to make note of if you map out the whole tracklist. Gates switches from one to the other so regularly that the pattern is really conspicuous, and the issue isn't necessarily in the skeleton or outline or the number of topics presented but rather in the nature of the topics. The sensationalization of the dangerous black \"gutter\" and emotionalized intersex relations are such trite rituals for rap in these times. Accurate reporting from real black communities is always useful, but here it's wickedly and exaggeratedly characterized and dramatized so that it's no longer in a useful context.\n\nBars-wise, Gates is up to snuff based on his prior standards, but lyrically he hasn't challenged himself. His scratchy low voice and occasionally funny side remarks and hooks are unmistakeable, but it's all in the service of his and his label's agenda and image-advancement. The music doesn't make a great impression or step forward either, and for all the different producers involved in making Islah, the beats all sound too similar, too consistent from one to the next, all using the current trap style or some pop variation, like in \"Kno One,\" a universally appealable slow jam engineered for the people. And besides Trey Songz, Jamie Foxx and Ty Dolla $ign in the bonus \"Jam,\" the non-deluxe version is completely guest-less. For a debut, Islah is disappointing, and considering who and where it's coming from, people shouldn't be surprised. Kevin Gates cares more about getting major \"paper\" in the game than being a major player in the game.","classification":1,"fold":6}

{"text":"When fans talk about Metallica, many of them refer to the first four albums as thrash classics, grouping them together as if they all feature the same style and fit into the same genre.  What I see many people fail to point out is that Ride the Lightning was just as huge a shift in sound and style from Kill `Em All as The Black Album was from And Justice For All.\n\nWhen Metallica wrote Kill `Em All, thrash as a subgenre of heavy metal didn't exist yet.  They were influenced by speed metal bands like Venom and Motorhead, and produced a debut album where the musical traits of those bands were stamped clearly on just about every song.  Starting with Ride the Lightning, Metallica made a full shift to thrash, essentially defining the genre by making far more use of shredding riffs, melodic solos, and high-speed double bass drumming.  While James still utilized his scream on tracks like Trapped Under Ice, he employed a deeper overall tone and used a more gruff delivery.  You really don't hear many similarities to Kill `Em All musically; I mean, what songs from Ride the Lightning would sound right on that album?  In my opinion, none.  They  showed incredible progression and maturity from the wild, intense nature of Kill `Em All to the controlled powerhouse approach of Ride the Lightning.\n\nThe album itself is an easy five stars (bold statement, right?).  What metal fan doesn't know For Whom The Bell Tolls and Fade to Black by heart?  Crushing thrash songs like Fight Fire With Fire, the title track, Trapped Under Ice, and Creeping Death are relentlessly aggressive.  Escape highlights the melodic NWOBHM influence that was virtually non-existent on Kill `Em All.  The perennial favorite Metallica instrumental, The Call of Ktulu, rounds out one of the greatest metal albums of all time.  It has a sound completely distinct from their others, has some of the best songs in Metallica's catalog, and without question belongs in any collection of heavy music.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"One could say that Cyndi Laupers new album \"Detour\" is yet another in a long line of albums by rock\/pop stars who are turning to country to score a hit. You could say that, but that's not the case here. With \"Detour\" Cyndi is adding to her string of cover albums in genres that have inspired her. Prior to this she did \"At Last\" which was mostly 50's-60's pop and \"Memphis Blues\" which was a blues album. So this is right in line with what she's been doing as of late. Pauper can wrap her vocals around pretty much any type of song and sell it. With \"Detour\" she is doing pretty much straight forward covers of primarily 50's and 60's country songs. A couple of the tracks don't really fit this time line, \"Funnel Of Love\" is a cover of the 1961 Wanda Jackson pop b-side to her country single \"Right Or Wrong\". My mom had this 45 and I discovered the record when I was little and have \"Funnel Of Love\" ever since. Another that doesn't fit is \"Hard Candy Christmas\" which is actually from the 1970's musical \"The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas\" but best known by, and included here because of, Dolly Parton's 1982 remake.\n Most of the tracks work really well in particular the pair of Patsy Clone covers and Skeeter Davis's \"The End Of The World\". There are two really corny covers. The first, and better of the two, is the Loretta Lynn\/Conway Twitty novelty hit \"You're The Reason Our Kids Are Ugly\". Done here as a duet with Vince Gill. Like the original it contains ad libbed banter between the two as the song closes. The worst of the album though is the cover of the Patsy Montana chestnut \"I Want To Be A Cowboys Sweetheart\". The whole song just doesn't quite work for me. It features Jewel yodeling. I've never liked this song in the first place and Cyndi doesn't help that.\n Overall this is a decent album, not really sure who this will appeal to. Cyndi's long time fans may find something to like here. Fans of classic country will certainly find something to enjoy, but casual fans of either will likely pass on it.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"CALIFORNIA SOUL, an Ashford & Simpson composition, sung by Marlena Shaw is a treat to the ears! I heard this song a few years back, it was playing in the background of a car commercial and everyone in the room wanted to know the name and who sang it. I had to find it and add it to my collection. Since then, I've heard it on 3 more commercials and it was on Lincoln Lawyer soundtrack, and featured in the movie The Italian Job. From the time the music starts playing, you know you're in for a treat and you get it. The music is upbeat and the melody is sweet. Marlena's voice is on point; it's uniquely powerful and full of soul. She has great control of her instrument and you get swept up in the soulful way she delivers each and every note. This song is still going strong and this is a testament to how great of a singer she is. It's no wonder - California Soul has been sampled over and over by rappers (Gang Starr, The Game, etc.), beer manufacturers, Dockers, countless television commercials and a driving game - Driver: San Frisco. I like the album, but I LOVE THIS SONG. You can't listen to it once, you have to play it over and over because it's so good. It's a timeless classic. Great tune and highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":6}

And Song For Guy is soothing to the soul. The piano touches are quite special.\n\nElton explores many styles on this recording as opposed to sticking with a constant arrangment as he has done on previous recordings such as Caribou and Madman Accross The Water.  This is a good thing.  Howeve, the last few songs are pretty unmemorable in the hook department.  Others midway through the record have pleasant arrangments but lack a strong melody.\n\nTherefore, this is a good recording but not on the same level as Elton's prime time era or even The One or Too Low For Zero.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"I was so excited when I finished this album! She is not a sell-out! I still would like her even if she was, but she is not, and I'm happy I can tell everybody that.\nSTAND is the ultimate Jewel song, very reminiscent of WHO WILL SAVE YOUR SOUL? from those early days. RUN 2 U is a really cool upbeat dance track. INTUITION is that cool top 30 hit you've heard lately. Read the lyrics. It's classic Jewel. (I love Ms. J's big butt is boss-who do you think this is about :) LEAVE THE LIGHTS ON is a cool jazz-infused song. Ooh so good and Jewel-like! 2 FIND U is a beautiful poetic ballad. A great new kind of song for Jewel, she sings a beautiful ballad like Celine would only she writes her own. FRAGILE HEART is another beautiful poetic ballad more Jewel-like in the vocal area. DOIN' FINE is a cool upbeat dance record that uses the guitar in a really odd that's different and very interesting. 2 BECOME 1 is an excellent song very beautiful even better done live acoustic but excellent on the album; almost a sequel to 2 FIND U. HAUNTED is easily the coolest song she's ever written. It's truly haunting. I feel like I'm stalking Jewel as I hear it and I feel bad for her, but I can't help myself. SWEET TEMPTATION is a really excellent track, more a rock 'n roll record than a dance record. YES U CAN is a cool upbeat rock record she originally wrote for Santana but he decided not to keep. I'm glad he didn't, her performance is great. Such a cool song! YOU & ME=LOVE is another cool upbeat song. The title is the theme of the song. AMERICA is a thought-provoking dance record about what we do in America, whether it be good things or bad things. She mentions plenty of both, and quite skillfully. BECOMING is a great ballad about Jewel becoming, as she constantly becoming other things. She is young, and she is still a work in progress, and she intends to keep acknowledging that truth.\nThis is definitely her second best album to PIECES OF YOU. It is better than THIS WAY and SPIRIT only by a little but nevertheless if you get an album better than those two albums that's really saying something. Folks, Jewel is hear to stay, and so is the ever-present guitar on this album. She is blossoming and you can see it in this CD, and she still has her guitar at her side as she's blossoming. It's beautiful to see her blossoming! Get your copy of 0304 and experience the beauty of this CD and a glimpse at a special artist ever-evolving!","classification":5,"fold":6}

The punchy post-punk flow of guitars & keyboards\/synthesizers by Josh Homme (Queens of the Stone Age, Kyuss, Eagles of Death Metal, Them Crooked Vultures) and Dean Fertita (QOTSA, The Dead Weather) + Matt Helders (Arctic Monkeys) on drums mixes with the periodic infusion of horns, strings and background singersall combining to create an addictive flow of quiet, implied danger and reckless beauty in the midst of a classic, timeless rock album.

{"text":"Stories of alcohol abuse and irreverence are usually the talk of male recording artists, with Courtney Love being the only exception to the rule.  Enter Amy Winehouse, a British songstress who embodies the individualism of Pink, the brash of a younger Madonna, the soul of Erykah Badu, and the spirit of 1960's jazz singers on Back To Black.  The animated nature of Back To Black is rarely seen these days because there is a certain stigma that goes along with it when it's attached to an entertainer.  Nevertheless, Amy Winehouse embraces any comparison the media and listening public has for her.  The appeal of the presumptuous \"Rehab\" sent the song soaring up the charts and feverishly downloaded into MP3 players by everybody and their momma.  \"You Know I'm No Good\" is just as assertive, only this time it's Amy giving a fair warning about who she is and you'll ultimately have to deal with it.  \"Me and Mr. Jones\" is filled with humorous (yet adult-natured) quips about a guy that's stood her up for a Slick Rick concert.  She even ponders her relationship with a guy who's already taken for the song \"Just Friends.\"  And at first listen, listening to \"Back To Black\" might sound like she's talking about a failed relationship, but examining more closely might suggest that she's actually talking about a drug dependency.  Songs like \"Love Is A Losing Game\" and \"Wake Up Alone\" are very descriptive and seem more heartfelt than just regular compositions by everyday songwriters.  \"Tears Dry On Their Own\" captures the emotion of a one-sided break-up, but expounds the feeling that you can eventually look past it all without much disenchantment.  The album closes with the enamored track \"Some Unholy War,\" the engrossing lyrics of \"He Can Only Hold Her,\" and a remix of \"You Know I'm No Good\" with Ghostface Killah giving a riveting verse filled with conviction to accompany the theme of the song.  Back To Black is good, mature music that invites listeners to examine the true meaning of the songs.  Amy Winehouse has a way with words, and thankfully for her....everybody's listening.","classification":5,"fold":6}
{"text":"CooleyHighHarmony is a classic album that has yet to be topped by any of these so-called R&B artists that are out now. Boyz II Men put Philly on the map as well as laid themselves a strong foundation in R&B with that album. There was only one way they could have went after Cooleyhighharmony: up. And they did with this superb sophomore release.\n\nThere are too many tracks that are vintage Boyz II Men tracks. Thank You, All Around The World, Vibin and U Know are excellent tracks the the Philly quartet. I'll Make Love To You and On Bended Knee were on Blender(cheap knockoff of Rolling Stone) and Vh1 as awesomely bad songs countdown but those love ballads are classics so the hell with Blender and VH1! These are the songs that these immature little freaks were conceived to and they have the nerve to trash it but never once do they mention any Eminem, D12 or any Shady records artists as well as Justin Timberlake. Are they trying to say that none of these artists make awesomely bad records? Really? I find that type of favoritism questionable. Plus forms of media like Vh1, Blender and GQ only appeal to idiotic trendies that think that saying \"Meh\" at the beginning of every sentence and defending movies that stink to high heaven makes them hip.\n\n50 Candles, Water Runs Dry, Trying Times and Yesterday are more smooth R&B ballads that give this album a much needed boost. There are no bad songs on this album so I'll keep going on.\n\nBottom Line: Boyz II Men's II is the best sophomore album from an R&B quartet of all time. The ballads are exceptional and the fast songs aren't bad plus the group still has what most groups R&B groups now sorely lack: harmony. If you love 90s R&B in its purest form you cant go wrong with this sophomore effort by Boyz II Men.\n\nStandouts: THANK YOU, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, U KNOW, VIBIN, TRYING TIMES, I'LL MAKE LOVE TO YOU, ON BENDED KNEE, WATER RUNS DRY and YESTERDAY.","classification":5,"fold":6}

There is pedal steel on three tracks (Queen of California, Shadow Days, and Whiskey Whiskey Whiskey) and lap steel on another (Born and Raised). I don't recall if this is JM's first time using steel guitar, but he uses it well. In fact, my only complaint is that he doesn't use it often enough.\n\nContinuum is still his best album, and it isn't really close, but Born & Raised is a worthy and timely addition. Given the rapid musical desertification that is occurring at the hands of dance-pop glitz infested radio, Born & Raised comes as an intensely quenching and relieving swig of cool water. We should support this album for that reason alone-- to show that we still crave popular music that has soul.\n\nP.S. - If you adore this album, then you'd probably also adore a similarly folksy and steel-guitar-y album from Ray LaMontagne:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/God-Willin-The-Creek-Don-t-Rise\/dp\/B003QCCS36\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">God Willin' & The Creek Don't Rise<\/a>.","classification":5,"fold":6}

The introspective songwriting is still here, it's just backed with dance beats and a more polished sound that her folk\/country stuff from previous albums. Yes Jewel has gone pop, but her music still has substance. Many accuse her of selling out, but she hasn't, this style of music isn't what is all over the place right now. The first single \"Intution\" is a piece of pop heaven, that has proven to be a big hit for her, and people seem to enjoy her new style. There's so many good songs that could be singles like \"Stand\", \"Run 2 U\", \"2 Find U\", \"Fragile Heart\", \"Haunted\", etc. This is a great album, give it a try and keep an open mind.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"NOTE: This review was written for the special 'Target' edition of this new James Taylor CD, which was originally listed on a separate page here on Amazon. Subsequently Amazon has combined the listings with the result that all versions of this James Taylor CD can be viewed on this single page, which has also resulted in both of my reviews appearing here as well, something that does not normally happen. I'm maintaining this review here rather than deleting it as a duplication mostly because it includes comments that I wanted to be preserved.\n\nOriginal review to this Target edition:\n\n-----------------\n\nNOTE: This is the special 'Target' edition of this new James Taylor CD. It includes three 'bonus' tracks that are unique to the Target edition (see details below). The main product listing for this recording can be seen here on Amazon (Before This World, where there are several formats available (CD, CD+DVD, super-deluxe combo edition, LP, .mp3 download). None of those other editions include the three 'bonus' tracks, which are only included in this version produced for Target.\n\nMy review to this CD follows, as posted on the main product page here on Amazon:\n\n-----------------\n\nI hadn't realized that it's been 13 years since James Taylor had issued a studio album with new original material, but it turns out that is has been that long (to be strictly correct,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/October-Road\/dp\/B003IMV8I0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">October Road<\/a>, which was released in 2002, was his last studio album with new material; others released since then were&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Covers\/dp\/B001D5DQCU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Covers<\/a>&nbsp;in 2008 and with his interpretations of songs written by other artists;&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Live-at-the-Troubadour\/dp\/B0039TD7PY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Live at the Troubadour<\/a>, with Carole King, with a mixture of songs written by Taylor, King, and others;&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/A-Christmas-Album\/dp\/B00078V7AW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">A Christmas Album<\/a>&nbsp;(2004);&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/James-Taylor-At-Christmas\/dp\/B0099TJ4YQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">James Taylor At Christmas<\/a>&nbsp;(2006); and the live album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Amchitka-The-1970-Concert-That-Launched-Greenpeace\/dp\/B003M7LLC4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Amchitka The 1970 Concert That Launched Greenpeace<\/a>&nbsp;with Joni Mitchell and Phil Ochs, that was released in 2009).\n\nTo write these new songs, James borrowed a friend's apartment in Newport, Rhode Island, and for one weekend a month over several months in 2013 and 2014 he worked undisturbed and focused on writing, as he hadn't been able to do for over a decade. The results are worth the long wait (well, we would have liked something sooner of course, but now that it's here I think his fans are grateful to receive it!).\n\nHe sounds as good as ever, as you would expect from a singer who has continued to tour and give concerts pretty much continuously for the past several decades, and it's still James with his soft clear voice in this selection of ten songs. In fact it almost sounds like the 1970's again. Nine of the songs are brand new James Taylor compositions, and those make up the first nine tracks of the album. The final track, Wild Mountain Thyme. is a folk song written by Francis McPeake that has been widely covered over the years and is very beautifully performed here.\n\nThe album was recorded mostly at the Barn, the recording studio near to his home, and in producing this recording he's brought together many of his longstanding musical collaborators including Michael Landau (guitar), Larry Goldings (keyboards), Luis Conte (percussion), Steve Gadd (drums) and Jimmy Johnson (bass). It was produced by Dave O'Donnell, who's also been associated with James for many years.\n\nThere are also some special guests together with James for several of the songs:\n\n- track 2, `You and I Again': Yo-Yo Ma on cello\n- track 3, `Angels of Fenway': harmony vocals by James's wife Kim and son Henry\n- track 8, `Before This World\/Jolly Springtime': Yo-Yo Ma on cello, Sting harmony vocals\n- track 10, `Wild Mountain Thyme': harmony vocals by James's wife Kim and son Henry\n\nThemes of the songs on this album are also familiar to those of us who are longtime fans of James - `Watchin' Over Me' (recovery, and a personal reflection on James's own years fighting the demons of depression and substance abuse); `You and I Again' (love song); `Stretch of the Highway' (traveling); `Today, Today, Today' (working); `Far Afghanistan' (war).\n\nThe album times in at just under 42 minutes, perhaps roughly comparable to a live set if you were hearing James at a concert. He put a great deal of effort into the collection of songs that is included here, and the sequence that they are presented, in order to provide the listening experience exactly the way he wanted it. It was worth the effort, and listening to the album from beginning to end, there is nothing discordant about how the music flows from one song to the other. Each of the songs has a specific meaning, and the overall experience is, well, it sounds just like a James Taylor album should sound! It's great to hear him as good as ever (at age 67!).\n\nThis album also includes a nicely produced booklet, which begins with a note from James discussing the music on the album, and includes lyrics for each song, along with photos throughout. It's very well done and\n\nCOMMENT regarding the various editions of this album:\n\nAs can be seen on this Amazon page, this can be purchased as a CD, or as a CD plus DVD, or as a super-deluxe package that includes a book and other neat stuff.\n\nI have the CD plus DVD that I purchased at Target (sorry, Amazon!), and it also has a feature that isn't available with any of the versions offered here, three 'bonus' tracks that are exclusive to Target. I've seen this before with other music CD's that have exclusive Wal-Mart editions as well.\n\nFor those who might be curious regarding what is included with the Target edition, here are the three additional tracks along with some explanatory information:\n\n- Track 11: Pretty Boy Floyd -- written by Woody Guthrie, recorded in Nashville with Mark Knopfler and Chuck Ainlay in 1999 at the same session that was planned to work on October road and produced the song Sailing to Philadelphia where James accompanied Mark. That song appeared on the album of the same name:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sailing-to-Philadelphia\/dp\/B00004Y6Q0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sailing to Philadelphia<\/a>.\n- Track 12: I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You) -- written by Hank Williams (James says it 'has always been my favorite Hank Williams song'), recorded in 2003 with Danny Kortchmar on electric guitar accompanying James.\n- Track 13: Diamond Joe -- traditional, recorded in Nashville at the same session where track 11 above was recorded.\n\nThese additional tracks bring the total time of the CD to 54 minutes.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Prime Cuts: One Black Sheep, Let It Rain, Heartbreak Dreamer\n\n\"Just Kids\" unfolds like a novella with page after page of anecdotes from Mat Kearney's own life.  With perspicuous attention paid to details, you can almost picture each scene in your mind's eye as Kearney sings about growing up, his struggles with faith, his bouts with self-identity, his run in with God, his meeting with his future wife, and his dreams and aspirations.  Just like every well-narrated story, there is a dimension to these autobiographical accounts that have bearing on those of us who care to lean in to listen.  Many of the issues that Kearney sings about on this record will not only strike a chord that resonates with us, but they also have a pedagogical function in teaching us from truths milled through the wheels of life refined by the very Word of God.\n\n\"Just Kids\" came together over the past few years while Kearney toured the world. For the very first time, he built a portable studio on his bus, and he cut songs all over the globe from Los Angeles and Sweden to his home studio in Nashville. Most of this vision is a product of his own production, but he had a little help from MDL [Maroon 5, Justin Bieber] as well as frequent collaborator, Josh Crosby. Since his Columbia Records debut, \"Nothing Left to Lose,\" Kearney has amassed for himself a total of 5 top 20 hits on the Adult Top 40 Chart.\n\nFeaturing a Middle Eastern serpentine melody and the militant sounding percussion over half-spoken-half-sung vocals of Kearney, album opener \"Heartbreak Dreamer\" has all the hallmarks of a hit single. It is essentially a shout-out to the overlooked heroes the world frowns upon.  Continuing on the inspirational route is \"Moving On,\" an insatiably catchy tune adorned with a stoic 80s-Police coolness.  Kearney's keening attention paid to details is in exhibition on the title cut \"Just Kids.\"  The first line that will harken so many memories for those of us who grew up in the 90s:  \"'Cause it was Bell Biv DeVoe, playing on my radio\/And I had Wu-Tang Clan living in my stereo.\"\n\nBoasting a hint of Mumford & Sons folkish vibe is \"One Black Sheep.\"  It's a coming of age song where Kearney recalls his nascent feelings of sin and his need for a Savior in the midst of a well-narrated storyline.  Lyrically the most heartwarming song is the retro-sounding power ballad \"Let It Rain.\"  It is quipped with lots of great lines; this is a song that will help those who of us who feel like we are submerged in the floods of life.  On the other hand, lead single \"Heartbeat,\" though not the best song on the record, has a more contemporary sound to it leaning towards electronica.\n\nExperimenting with a cacophony of sounds from 80s-pop to rustic folk to contemporary EDM to 90s-soul-rap, there isn't a dull moment on this record.  And to add further zest to already a spicy record are the vivid images and picturesque descriptions.  All of these thus make \"Just Kids\" a gorgeous three-dimensional sonic autobiography.","classification":4,"fold":6}

Then suddenly, you realize it's won your heart.* I love the minor key of this song. I tugs at my heart and attempts to draw my very soul out. I actually visualize the darkened rooms in the evening. Then I see a young man pleading with his girlfriend to take steps toward a commitment she isn't sure she's ready for. Looking back over my fifty years, I didn't appreciate this ballad so much as I do now. I am fortunate that I've been married more than half of my life to the same man. Yet I see so many young kids getting married and I hope that they are doing it for love, not just because they're expected to. I hope that women especially will realize that they are forever someone's daughter. Someday, God willing, they will become a mother and grandmother -- but when will they ever just be themselves?  There needs to be a year or two where they learn who they are, not what they are by how someone else defines them!\n\n*Note, I am a cat lover.

I liked this album, but that's about it. I do not understand why Rick chose to remake songs almost identical to their originals. I really did not enjoy his version of The Dream Academy's \"Life In A Northern Town\" or Foreigner's \"Waiting For A Girl Like You\". I did not understand why he got Richard Page of Mr. Mister to redo \"Broken Wings\". I mean, why get the vocalist of the song to do the song again? His version of Human League's \"Human\" also failed. However, there was something likeable about his version of The Church's \"Under The Milky Way\" and John Lennon's \"Imagine\". The only original song, \"Cry\", cannot hold a candle to the other classics on the disc. Why is that Rick would do an album of covers not even two years after releasing his first album of original material in five years?

I admit that this review is also influenced by the fact that I think that he is very hot in the video. The song contains many good industrial rock notes in it, and I like the words to the chorus when he nearly seductively whispers towards the middle of the song (there is a cool chorus part where he says the following lyrics that I find very sexy and creative:( Through every forest, above the trees Within my stomach, scraped off my knees I drink the honey inside your hive You are the reason I stay alive). Obviously, many who read this review already know exactly what that part of the chorus means. I was only listing one part of the various great parts of the song that I found very exciting.

{"text":"Similar Skin finds Umphrey's McGee becoming heavier and more progressive than ever before. They always had this side to them and you heard a lot of this on Mantis. Death by Stereo found them retaining their genre hopping ways but becoming more commercial. Similar Skin still finds the band genre hopping but it does sound like they've been listening to some Rush as you can hear their influence peppered throughout, especially on \"The Linear\", \"Puppet String\", and the title track. One thing about this album's harder nature is that is shows a welcome return of Jake Cinninger and Brendan Bayliss' guitars back to the forefront. But as usual, the band throws you a curveball and a gem at that with the excellent \"No Diablo\". They've been writing at least one catchy pop song per album for a while but they outdid themselves on this one with its memorable piano line and chorus. From this point, progressive rules the day best evidenced on \"Educated Guess\" and \"Bridgeless\". The only songs that are lacking are \"Little Gift\" and \"Hindsight\", which find the band jacking up the distortion on their guitars. The riffs on these tracks are super heavy and they grow on you. However, the silly choruses do not, especially on \"Little Gift\". Fortunately, these songs are among the shortest on the album so it doesn't upset the flow much. All told, Similar Skin shows Umphrey's McGee continuing to expand their palette as well as their chops and if you liked their other albums but also like something heavier, you'll dig it.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"I started listening to Tegan and Sara when The Con came out.  I loved that song and still think it is one of the best songs of the past 15 years.  I bought all their albums, and then Sainthood when it was released.  I'm not a big fan of acoustic music, but I like just about any song with a good melody.  Songs like \"My Number\" are among my favorites, but I prefer the more rock and pop music they've done.  So Jealous was my favorite T&S album until Heartthrob.\n\nI always thought T&S had a bit of '80s influence in their music, especially the So Jealous album, \"The Con\" single, and some songs on Sainthood.  I love that they took it further.  There isn't a bad track on this album.  I've played it, or parts of it, almost every day since it was released.  Bought the CD, and also the vinyl for a nostalgic feeling.  It's great music to enjoy, especially if you like pop, new wave, or electro-pop.  The album has a complexity to it like someone else mentioned.  I hear something different in it each time I play it, and I'm not tired of it after many repeat plays.\n\nMy favorites are I Was a Fool, Drove Me Wild, Shock to Your System, Closer, and I Couldn't Be Your Friend.  The rest are good too, but sometimes blend together in sound.  Still, it doesn't really matter to me that there isn't a lot of variety, because it's such a good sound throughout the album.  It's less rock than So Jealous, but even that album had synths and pop-type songs on it.  My one complaint about Heartthrob would be that the bonus tracks are not on the CD.  So glad Amazon gave them as a download with the CD purchase.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Kates distinct vocals are front and center on every track and in no way are overshadowed by the modern production, which while quite layered, never comes across as too busy or overproduced, a rarity these days. The arrangements are unusual but catchy as hell and the lyrics are original and clever, which means youll never hear any of these on the radio, ha-ha. Full lyrics are included in the liner notes too, which is much appreciated.\n\nMy favorites include the dynamic opening ode to self-empowerment THROWING DOWN THE ROSES, the irresistible stomper MISTER SISTER that captures the pain of struggle of the transgender experience in only two verses and earworm chorus and BOTTOMS UP, which is the perfect song for cruising with the top down on a weekend afternoon, but each song here has its own unique charms (although I am not that crazy about the final depressing number PULLS YOU UNDER which prevents me from rating this 5 Stars).","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"What rock star sings about insecurity? What almost untouchable and glorified famous person writes a song that screams for help and then turns that pleading song into a massive hit? Cries for help rarely result in dancing, partying and feeling fab. Nonetheless, John Lennon's self-professed appeal for support filled the airwaves and, subsequently, the movie theaters of 1965. Perhaps this represents another pop music first? Therapy as hit single? A sort of trial run for Lennon's later primal scream sessions? The song apparently began as a far more anguished piano based ballad, but quickly morphed into the more jangly fun song that climbed the charts when its commercial potential became evident. No recordings seem to exist of the slow earlier version. A deeper look at the song reveals the almost incongruous tension between its lyrics and its music. The combination definitely works, but its self-conscious lyrics seem less threatening embedded in the great instrumentation and harmonies. Perhaps the music helped the countless teenagers, many who likely identified fervently with the words, swallow the bitter pill of the song's message? The film of the same name further downplayed the theme by wrapping it in a screwball James Bond-esque parody. Whatever the case or context, \"Help!\" remains one of the Beatles', and one of pop music's, classic songs.\n\nUnlike many bands, especially bands of today, the Beatles continued to morph and experiment throughout their brief career. \"Help!\" continues the experimentation of its predecessor, \"Beatles For Sale\" adding flute, more dominant keyboards, heavy acoustic guitar and experimental arrangements. \"Ticket To Ride,\" with its guitar arpeggio onslaught, sounded unlike anything at the time. Likewise, \"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\" sounds unlike anything the Beatles had done before, sounding far more folk than rock. Some even consider \"I've Just Seen A Face\" a pure country song (though many bewailed its absence as the lead song on the 1980s \"Rubber Soul\" CD release). Of course the big shocker remains \"Yesterday,\" which probably seemed billions of miles away from the Beatles' sound at the time. Many consider it one of the best songs ever written, it only features McCartney with a string quartet and represents the most poignant clue as to what the band would become in the late 1960s (though \"I'll Follow The Sun\" from \"Beatles For Sale\" provided some extra foreshadowing). Harrison managed to sneak in two songs, \"I Need You,\" with its ethereal pulsating guitar, and the less impressive but still decent \"You Like Me Too Much.\" Cover songs were kept to a minimum and pretty much disappeared from subsequent albums. In retrospect, \"Help!\" seems like the perfect dividing point between what some call \"The Early Beatles\" and \"The Late Beatles.\" Future albums would wrench the band in unimaginable and almost unprecedented directions. The end of their surreal, and sometimes futile, touring schedule in 1966 catalyzed this change.\n\nIn the US, of course, the album was sliced and diced for maximum profit. The original British LP included songs from the film on side one and a potpourri on side two. Similar to \"A Hard Day's Night,\" the US release contained all of the film songs with instrumentals intertwined. Other songs appeared on \"Yesterday and Today,\" \"Rubber Soul\" and the uninspiringly titled \"Beatles VI.\" Consequently, US fans experienced Beatlemania, and the band's unique evolution, very differently from fans in the UK. The slaughter finally ended with \"Sgt. Pepper's,\" but still causes some confusion and resentment for fans who remain fond of the earlier US versions. In any case \"Help!\" continued the undeniably and justifiably and shamelessly lauded singularity that was The Beatles.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"It hasn't been a good decade for Korn. Slumping record sales combined with line-up changes and creative frustration have threatened to force the group into irrelevance. In 2005, the band saw the exit of guitarist Brian \"Head\" Welch and released \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/See-You-on-the-Other-Side\/dp\/B000BMSTMS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">See You on the Other Side<\/a>\", a blatantly over-produced and experimental album that attempted to reinvent the band's signature sound by blanketing it in dense electronics and slick pop production. A mere two years later, and with the arrival of \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Untitled\/dp\/B000RPCJYI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Untitled<\/a>\" the band had bid farewell to drummer David Silveria, thus slimming down to a three-piece. With three different drummers in tow, \"Untitled,\" lacked consistency which compromised its creativity. In turn, it flopped harder than any Korn album before and for a while, it looked the band would never recover.\n\n With album number nine, the Bakersfield heroes attempt to set things right once and for all. By recruiting drummer Ray Luzier (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Army-of-Anyone\/dp\/B000IHY9ZW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Army of Anyone<\/a>) full-time and reuniting with producer Ross Robinson -- the man at the helm of their ground-breaking&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/debut\/dp\/B000002AUU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">debut<\/a>&nbsp;and its follow-up, \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Life-Is-Peachy\/dp\/B000002BHP\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Life Is Peachy<\/a>\" -- \"Korn III: Remember Who You Are\" is an honest to goodness attempt at a return to form for a band facing a mid-career crisis. Gone are the pop-songwriters and the studio trickery which masked the group's short-comings and in their place is a down and dirty, back to basics sound that attempts to re-capture the intensity and immediacy that accompanied their best work.\n\nUnfortunately, this technique also serves to show the holes in Korn's creative process, revealing a band that sounds incomplete. Part of what made the first two Korn albums so great was the call-and-response riffing of James \"Munky\" Shaffer and Welch, and since the band refuses to hire a full-time second guitarist (and instead, choose to cram their touring guitarist Shane Gibson behind the equipment during live shows), Munky's riffs are forced to pick up much of the slack in the band's sound, but without accompaniment, fall flat. The biggest crime on \"Remember Who You Are\" is the lack of a single memorable riff in the vein of \"Clown\" or \"Good God.\" Nowhere is this more evident than on the album's first single, \"Oildale (Leave Me Alone)\".  Instead, it's left up to the rhythm section to compensate, and to that end, the album succeeds. Ray Luzier is a big part of the album's sound, and his chemistry with Fieldy on bass is evident throughout. Between the two, some of the band's grooviest and catchiest material in years comes to fruition on songs such as \"Pop a Pill\" and \"Fear is a Place to Live\".\n\nThe biggest enemy of the album, however, is frontman Jonathan Davis. While Davis turns in a decent enough vocal performance, the subject matter of his lyrics is cringe-inducing at best. While he made valiant enough efforts at expanding his scope on the band's latter-day albums, he regresses to the whiny, mopey dude in a track-suit that he grew out of many, many years ago. When you're pushing forty and you've got a successful marriage, career and children, it's hard to take it seriously when you cry at the end of a song. This sort of thing worked in 1994, but even its most hardcore fanbase has grown out of Korn's self-pitying and for a while, it seemed like Davis had too. The lyrics and their delivery sound forced and artificial, verging on self-parody at times and threaten to tear down whatever integrity the album may have.\n\nOn the whole, \"Korn III: Remember Who You Are\" isn't exactly the return to form that you may be hoping for, but for a band that has slimmed down considerably, they make do with what they have, with the addition of Luzier being perhaps the best thing to happen to the band in years. Old-school fans might find comfort in hearing a band attempt to re-align itself with its roots, but those who have grown above and beyond will find it to be merely child's play. It makes for decent enough background music, but when examined too closely, there are too many surface cracks and flaws to ignore. Is this Korn's \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/St-Anger\/dp\/B00008OWZG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">St. Anger<\/a>\" and is there a much better album to follow? Or have they stalled creatively and changed so much that they will no longer be able to function as a cohesive band? Only time will tell.","classification":3,"fold":6}
{"text":"It was 1985, and this song called \"So In Love\" was playing in frequent rotation on the radio. At age 12, I liked it, but it didn't register yet. Flash forward to 1986, \"Pretty In Pink\" is released and \"If You Leave\" shoots up the charts. Great song, now I know who OMD are (or so I think). Flash forward to Christmas 1986, my cousins get me a cassette tape (yes, remember those?) of \"The Pacific Age\" (I know what you're thinking already). I listen to it over and over and decide, yes, I like OMD. Flash forward to 1988, \"Dreaming\" is released, and it is just okay, I think. Then the break-up. I find \"Sugar Tax\" as an import and wonder is this THE OMD? Sure enough, Andy McCluskey pulls a Tears For Fears, and continues on with the band's moniker even though he is the only remaining member of the original band.\n\nAnd so on and so forth. In the early 2000's I get \"Navigation: The B-Sides\" and go back and get everything pre-\"The Pacific Age\", and I am struck by how talented this New Wave band was, and that in America, they were given short shrift, only being known, truly, for \"If You Leave\", when they are so much more than that.\n\n2005, OMD re-forms, and promise of a new album starts to percolate. 2010, finally, \"The History Of Modern\"--except it isn't so modern. No, reports state many of these tracks were written before the re-formation, some of them were rejected from Andy McCluskey's pet projects, others were started back in the early 1980's, and still more were started in the 1990's. Hmmm.\n\nWell, let's put it this way: I am very happy to have OMD back. It was time for all these current bands who are directly borrowing from greats like OMD, to see how it's done. Bands like White Lies, The Postal Service, Empire Of The Sun, The Killers, Keane, to name but a few.\n\n\"History Of Modern\" is the first time in 24 years the original four members have worked on an album together, and the first OMD album in 14 years. With 14 tracks, there are bound to be some great tracks and some weak ones.\n\nSo let me get the weak ones out of the way first. \"Sometimes\" has to be the weakest track here. The refrain \"Sometimes I feel like a motherless child\" over and over gets real tiresome as moaned by either Jennifer John or Lucy Styles. Very annoying, along with the hip-hop record scratching, this song is the worst track here. The other track, as much as I like Aretha Franklin, is \"Save Me\". I didn't feel like it belonged here, and it didn't. It's a bonus track on the U.S. edition.\n\nNow the great songs: \"New Babies: New Toys\" is a great album opener that doesn't just have trademark OMD synths, but some guitar heft as well. \"If You Want It\" is a solid ballad that follows. My favorite track on the entire album is \"History Of Modern, Pt. 1\". This is what OMD does best, and I think to myself, Coldplay gets all over the radio with \"Viva La Vida\", a song that's not that far removed from \"History Of Modern, Pt. 1\", but OMD get no airplay. Hmmm. \"History Of Modern, Pt. 2\" rounds out the first four tracks very nicely. Then we're hit with \"Sometimes\", followed by the okay tracks \"RFWK\" and \"New Holy Ground\".\n\nThe second half of the album starts with an almost disco sounding \"The Future, The Past, And Forever After\" which is okay. \"Sister Marie Says\" has been compared to \"Enola Gay\", and I get the comparison, but \"Sister Marie Says\" still has enough about it to set it apart from \"Enola Gay\". Still, it's an okay song. Now, I know I'm going to hear complaints about this, but I actually liked \"Pulse\". I thought it was a different style that OMD actually did quite well. In fact, as I listened to it, I thought of Duran Duran, and that \"Pulse\" could have been taken from their 2007 album \"Red Carpet Massacre\" (take note Duran Duran, you're being reviewed in February 2011 with your new album). \"Green\" is good, and so is \"Bondage Of Fate\". My second favorite track is \"The Right Side?\" Sprawling out to eight minutes, this song gets the Kraftwerk treatment, and perhaps the closest track to a Human League track musically (take note Human League, you will be reviewed when your new album is released in March 2011).\n\nOn first listen, the album sounded better than it actually was. With repeated listening, I felt I came up with a more accurate rating for this album. It has some very good tracks, quite a few okay tracks, and a couple of undesirable tracks. There is a good deal of variety here, so nothing to get bored with. Overall, a very strong return to form for a band that has not worked on an album in 24 years! Also, like always, prior to listening to \"History Of Modern\", and went back to the beginning and listened to each OMD album in sequential order so as to hear how the band changed over the years. \"History Of Modern\" is definitely a mash of up of all different phases of their career with a heavier leaning towards their middle and late career rather than their first four albums (I know this may disappoint some fans, but I like all phases of OMD).\n\nSo here is how \"History Of Modern\" rates next to their previous works:\n\n1980 Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark: Four Stars\n1980 Organisation: Four and a Half Stars\n1981 Architecture & Morality: Five Stars\n1983 Dazzle Ships: Five Stars\n1984 Junk Culture: Four Stars\n1985 Crush: Three and a Half Stars\n1986 The Pacific Age: Three and a Half Stars\n1991 Sugar Tax: Three and a Half Stars\n1993 Liberator: Two and a Half Stars\n1996 Universal: Four Stars\n2010 History Of Modern: Four Stars","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Yep, it is true.  I am not ashamed to like this band of Aussie punk powerpop goofballs.  Yes, I saw them live this past summer for a $5 ticket...I was like, what the heck...and I'm happy I did, it was a fun show, the guys were clearly enjoying themselves, acting like idiots in the most splendid way really.  They were tight and loose at the same time, and couldn't give a hoot if they made a mistake, or if the girl they pulled on stage to play guitar COULDN'T play guitar, it didn't matter.  The songs were cool and they had really tight sweet harmonies to boot.  Opening band HEY VIOLET (formerly Cherri Bomb) were a great (mostly) girlpop opener as well...waiting for their album now...\n\nOnto their new album, \"Sounds Good Feels Good\"...I had every right to expect it would be more of the same of their debut, which had some great songs, but I needed to see how the boys would evolve\/progress, in order for me to stick with em and follow their career.  The show was a good first step, as the new songs they played had promise and they boosted the debut's songs as well.  Then, I saw the good-to-great reviews...3 stars in Rolling Stone, A- in Newsday with Glenn Gamboa, etc.  Then a friend of mine bought it and said it was one of his fave albums of the year.  Then it was sold out at at least 3 Targets, and I did not want to miss out on the sale...$13.99 for the 19-tracker exclusive.  I had a feeling this record was going to be good.  And it is.  In context of the bands I enjoy, I would compare 5SOS to Northern Irish band ASH, who also started out as kids doing punk-inspired powerpop in the early 90s.  Their debut album was called \"1977\", named after the year they were born, as well as the birth year of both punk rock (the Sex Pistols' \"Never Mind The Bullocks\", the first Clash album, and 2 Ramones albums) and \"Star Wars\"...the 1st Ramones album was from 1976, which predated punk by a year, but who's counting??  ASH did release a taster EP called \"Trailer\" in 1995 and some singles and demo tapes between 1991 and 1994.  That means ASH's Tim Wheeler & Mark Hamilton were just 17 when they started making records, Rick McMurray a year or 2 older.  5SOS, how old are they??  The same, although drummer Ash (name coincidence??) Irwin is 21 now.  Like the BAND ASH, their drummer is 2 years older.  5SOS' first album and singles were equivalent to ASH's \"Trailer\" and pre-album singles, like \"Jack Names The Planets\", same sound, except 5SOS uses gang vocals, and ASH the band doesn't.\n\nThis new album, though, is a BIG leap forward in terms of songwriting and honing their sound to a very tight point, in melody and energy.  Just like \"1977\".  There are a coupla tracks the band did not write, but they fit with the band's own material, and it flows seamlessly.  I only played the album once, and it was an instant gem, almost like a punkier Bay City Rollers, and that's a GOOD thing!!  They also sound like the type of band that Sid & Marty Krofft would have embraced in the 70s and built a show around, like a Banana Splits or have Sigmund & the Sea Monsters characters running around, or a Monkees type of show, with 5SOS involved in some crazy antics and hijinks...in the 90s, Steven Spielberg wanted to create a new Monkees type of show around young Britpop band Supergrass, but the band turned him down...he should bring up the idea again for the Aussie goofballs...they would embrace it and it would be a fun watch, I think.  I'm not sure if there will be a better powerpop album released in 2015 than this one.  And these Aussie goofballs will only get better STILL.\n\nNow, a thought also occurred about 5SOS and ASH...5SOS were mislabeled a \"boyband\" at first, still are in some circles, which is wrong, as they are a (mostly) teen punk\/powerpop band.  Is it their ages??  However, in the 90s, ASH never were labeled a boyband??  Why weren't they, compared to 5SOS??  They were the same age at the same time...the band was even called \"Guaranteed Real Teenagers\" before they were called ASH!!  Was it because of their associations??  In 1994\/1995\/1996, they went on tour, supporting Britpop bands like Elastica and played the major UK festivals like Glastonbury and Reading.  Was it their record label??  In the UK, they were signed to credible indie called Infectious Records, who also had Elastica.  Britpop fans who dug ASH didn't focus on their ages but their songs, energy and charm, despite their youthfulness.  If they were the same age and released \"Trailer\" and \"1977\" NOW, in the age of social media, and 1D discovered em on YouTube playing tunes like \"Jack Names The Planets\" and took em on tour instead of them playing the Warped Tour, ASH WOULD have been mislabeled a \"boyband\", but they escaped that trap due to these circumstances, and are still going strong today, with a great new album \"Kablammo!!\"  On the same token, if 5SOS were a band at this age the same time as ASH and played the UK festivals and Aussie festivals like Big Day Out, in the heyday of Britpop and Green Day, would they have been mislabeled a \"boyband\"...probably not, but with this new album, they have the goods to transcend that label, and publications like People are realizing that the tag \"boyband\" was a mistake in regards to this band.\n\nFrom the beginning, I called 5SOS a Warped Tour punk band that somehow skipped the Warped Tour, meaning they skipped an important step on their way to domination, that they really didn't pay their dues properly and risked their artistic credibility.  This album proves they have the talent to get away with it in the end.  Makes you think...what if ALL the Warped Tour bands skipped the Warped Tour altogether, hopped on tours by teenpop bands like One Direction instead, as opening acts, like 5SOS did???  Would they get more success like 5SOS did??  Or are 5SOS just lucky??\n\nThis new album proves they have the talent to sustain the luck.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Geoff was a legendary part of the band from the beginning, but he was removed with good cause several years ago, has his own thing going now, and is completely irrelevant to this album, which is now Queensryche's second after his departure. Now, with that taken care of, on to the new music.\n\nI loved the self-titled QR, and even though it was put together fairly quickly, it had really good songs that were short, bare-bones heavy metal\/hard rock tunes focused on strong vocal melodies, twin guitar harmonies, and intricate drumming. In other words, the best features of old Queensryche. If it had any shortcomings, it was that the production was thin and overly compressed, and the sound was more melancholy than I'd hoped for after the band said they were going for a more classic style than the previous decade or so. Still, it was a huge step in the right direction and a sign that, given time to properly plan an album, these guys were capable of a much more epic release.\n\nIt's now time to rejoice, because that album has arrived. Condition Human makes the self-titled sound exactly like what it was; a warm-up. This is now a band firing on all cylinders, realizing the full potential of their reinvigorated lineup. Todd La Torre shows more poise, personality, and confidence with several years experience fronting the band under his belt. Positive fan feedback, good reviews, and steady touring have helped him come into his own as Queensryche's singer and enabled him to deliver a masterful performance. Michael Wilton shows a lot more muscle in the riff department on this one, favoring us with an engaging blend of crunchy riffs and classy melody. His guitar tone is much more rich than the thin sound heard on the self-titled. Eddie is Eddie, thumping out the bottom end, but he's also done justice by the improved production. No distracting rattle hampering the smoothness of his delivery. Rockenfield sounds inspired behind the kit, as each member of the band seems to be pushing one another to re-capture a bit of the old magic. And Parker, if he hadn't already, earns his spot with contributions to a second very good album and commanding live performances.\n\nI don't think there's a dud on the album, but I'm partial to Arrow of Time, Guardian, Hellfire, Eye9, Bulletproof, Hourglass, All There Was, and the fantastic title track. If you gave up on Queensryche during their weird years, give this album a shot. It's fair to say at this point that they are all the way back.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Some people will lambast me for saying that, but I'm just being honest.

{"text":"I miss rock n roll. I was a teen when grunge kicked hair metal and Michael Jackson off the charts, and the heyday of alt-rock (1991-1994) went a long way towards shaping my musical tastes for a lifetime.  The early 2000s hailed another, more minor rock revival with bands like The Strokes and The White Stripes bringing stripped-down garage rock back into the spotlight. It was around this time that I discovered Spoon, which became a favorite along with Yo La Tengo, Built To Spill, and other progressive indie-type bands. I've enjoyed each album released since the early 2000s with no exception. Over time, as some of Spoon's other rock n roll peers from the early 2000s fell away, the kind of music which Spoon makes has become more and more unique.\n\nSo here's Spoon's latest entry after a hiatus, and it very much reminds me why I missed this band. I missed Spoon because I miss rock n roll. Popular music these days seems to be more about talent shows on TV than it does about a bunch of people getting together to write songs and learn to play instruments for love of music.  I have a hard time relating to the talent show type stuff even when there is actually real talent involved (in some cases there truly is).  Maybe it's just my bias given the era in which I discovered music, but the kind of thing Spoon does seems more real and relatable to my ears.  This album in particular sounds like a bit of a fresh start for the band. It's got all the stuff I have always loved about Spoon's music but it's a bit warmer and brings the Cars influence to the forefront to create a modern take on power-pop. I'm not going to bother with a track-by-track because they are all great and worth hearing.  This is a refreshing take on a sound that is grounded in the history of the great art form we know of as rock music.  Too bad there aren't more artists out there doing this.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I remember being so excited when this album dropped. I can't believe I forgot to write a review; I could've sworn I did... Anyway, this is so refreshing to hear. A throwback album full of great soul\/R&B (that isn't just full of covers... sorry Boyz)! People must have forgot or been turned off by all the media hoopla, but R. Kelly is one of the best R&B artists ever! He makes this sound classic, yet I still feel like its clearly fresh, new music. I love how he pulled that off while paying tribute to greats such as Otis Redding, Stevie Wonder, up to Michael Jackson. And he still did it his way. Hey, who better to sing \"You Are Not Alone\" (a bonus track) than R. Kelly? He wrote and produced the original song anyway! \"When a Woman Loves\" is a fantastic display of his voice and appreciation for women. Seeing him perform it live is even better... SMH... I can't believe it. One of teh best male vocal performances I have ever heard. Despite me being a big R. Kelly fan, I don't even think I'm exaggerating. The title track is a great dance song that also has (OMG) MEANING to it. The rhythm and melody to Love Letter is infectious and soulful. \"I'm Not Feeling the Love\" is a sincere, poignant song about what it feels like when you think you've lost the love and romance in your life and relationship. There are so many good songs here.\n\nMan, the instrumentation, the rhythms, the lyrics, production and vocal performances on this album are top notch. Also, in case you didn't already figure it out, it's not full of garbage \"R&B\" that tries to cater to young, immature rap fans. R. Kelly has put out some lackluster material the past few years, no lie, and it would kill me every time. Aside from a few highlights, forget TP3, Double Up and the like. The man is better than trying to get high, drunk and silly with all these new jacks as if he were 21 years old. He proved it with this album. He's better. He's back. He can make seriously touching music that will make you want to dance, reminisce, cry, feel romantic, and... just anything associated with real R&B\/soul music. I can't go on enough about this album. This was really great, and it deserved a much better reception and more anticipation than it got. This is the realness right here. This is R. Kelly. Love Letter. GET IT.\n\nP.S. Can't wait for \"Write Me Back\" man! See you live June 29th! (and June 28th for the book signing!)","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Firstly, I am a huge Jewel fan.  She has written some of the most gorgeous ballads ever.  At first, I was disappointed to see her change her style for this latest offering.  The cover looks cheap and countless reviews slammed the album in general.  But let's not give up on Jewel so quickly.  I admit, I don't like the first single from 0304 \"Intuition\" because it is rather forgetful pop (and won't go down as a classic), but you cannot deny that it appealed to many younger people.  The second single \"Stand\" really appeals to me, on the other hand.  It is a very catchy song, and while it is not traditional Jewel, it shows that she can be versatile like any star out there. And at the end of the day, isn't that what is important about a singer?  To be able to re-invent themself from time to time?  Madonna has done it countless times and people accepted it.  I consider \"0304\" an opportunity that Jewel took to try something different.  She never said she wouldn't go back to her traditional style in the future.  Unfortunately at the moment, folk type music isn't that popular ... so that's another reason why Jewel is trying something different.  In 1978, the Rolling Stones released a disco single (Miss You) because that's what the public were really into then - even though rock was their normal style. Going with the flow, in other words. Times will change yet again, and folk music will be what the public want.  Cycles ...\n\"0304\" is Jewel in 2003.  It's not the classic of \"pieces of you\" or \"Spirit\", but it's not as vile as many reviewers have stated.","classification":3,"fold":6}

After watching the video that they put out on Metal Undergound back in 2011, I've been keeping an eye out for a release.  This has a lot of music I already own from different studio albums, but there are several previously unreleased cuts, including the two from Who Cares.  Those alone make it worth the purchase.  Although I loved Born Again (unlike many, I suppose) the Who Cares sound is highly polished and is almost impossible to reconcile with that 30 year old Black Sabbath release.  Put on the headphones, crank it up and try not to dwell on the fact that it's two old dudes kickin' ass...or maybe do.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Like most Americans, I was first learned of Bryan Adams in 1983 via MTV and the videos for \"Straight From The Heart\", \"Cuts Like A Knife\" and \"This Time\". As a 10 year old I didn't really know what to think of Bryan Adams. I mean, just look at all the other artists crowding MTV at the time, and then there's Bryan Adams. The following year, \"Reckless\" would dominate. \"Run To You\" began airing November 1984 and the hits just kept coming with \"Somebody\", \"Heaven\", \"Summer Of '69\", \"One Night Love Affair\" and \"It's Only Love\". I was saturated with Bryan Adams for the rest of my living days. 1987's \"Into The Fire\" didn't fare well. Perhaps Americans were tired of Adams. Burned out. \"Heat Of The Night\", \"Hearts On Fire\" and \"Victim Of Love\" didn't really possess the staying power, and I think Adams retreated, only to come roaring back in 1991 with \"Waking Up The Neighbors\" and another barrage of hits from \"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You\", \"Can't Stop This Thing We Started\", \"Thought I'd Died And Gone To Heaven\" and \"Do I Have To Say The Words?\". Enough, overkill, and then the ballads kept coming with 1993's \"All For Love\" and then \"Please Forgive Me\" and then \"Have You Really Ever Loved A Woman?\" Nail in coffin, goodnight.\n\nAnd that's just it, isn't it? I've always thought of Adams as a singles man, not an album man. His albums have so much filler, and guess what, even \"Get Up\" has that filler too. Adams hasn't had a top 40 hit since \"Here I Am\" from \"Spirit: Stallion Of The Cimarron\" back in 2002 (in America at least). I don't think Adams enjoys America too much since he's been burned at the stake here for 1996's \"18 Til I Die\" and 1998's \"On A Day Like Today\" (both mediocre albums with some good songs).\n\nSo, you would think that Adams, along with songwriting veteran partner Jim Vallance, and in the producer's chair, Jeff Lynne of ELO, that \"Get Up\" would be instant magic, right? Wrong. Here's the deal. \"Get Up\" is only nine songs, which is great, except for the filler like \"Go Down Rockin'\" \"We Did It All\", \"Don't Even Try\" and \"Yesterday Was Just A Dream\". Come on, admit it, those are the weakest tracks here. The other five are pretty good, but sound like ELO with Bryan Adams. Even Jeff Lynne's help couldn't fix Adams' and Vallance's weak songwriting habits.\n\nDo yourself a favor, just buy Adams' two disc \"Anthology\" from 2005. It has everything you'd want from Adams all in one neat package. Then, you can add select tracks from 2008's \"11\" and \"Get Up\" and you're done. Although, there are a few other album tracks I'd add like \"East Side Story\" from 2004's \"Room Service\" or \"Into The Fire\", \"Victim Of Love\", \"Another Day\" and \"Native Son\" from 1987's \"Into The Fire\".\n\nThe problem with 56 year old Adams is that he refuses to experiment much. He staunchly, almost defiantly, stands on middle of the road rock\/pop\/balladry. In fact, only 1987's \"Into The Fire\" showed any signs of Adams willing to stretch a bit more musically and lyrically.\n\nSo here's how \"Get Up\" compares to Adams other works:\n\n1980 Bryan Adams: Three Stars\n1981 You Want It, You Got It: Two and a Half Stars\n1983 Cuts Like A Knife: Three Stars\n1984 Reckless: Four Stars\n1987 Into The Fire: Four Stars\n1991 Waking Up The Neighbors: Three Stars\n1996 18 Til I Die: Three Stars\n1998 On A Day Like Today: Three Stars\n2004 Room Service: Three Stars\n2008 11: Three Stars\n2015 Get Up Three Stars","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"THIS third album by the legendary vocal super group THE STYLISTICS is a PERFECT THIRD STRIKE!!! Wow! it's as superb as \"THE ORIGINAL DEBUT ALBUM\" and \"ROUND 2\"!! This consummate recording is an extension of musical excellence indeed. Once more, the album was very well written, arranged, conducted and produced by MASTER THOM BELL, this man is most certainly a musical genius, he bought out the very best of anyone he worked with, including the vocally gifted lead RUSSELL THOMKINS JR.\nOverall, \"ROCKIN' ROLL BABY\" is indeed stellar in terms of musical and vocal sincerity, all songs are a message of love, hope, regret, mistakes and other positive and negative aspects of the human experience, weighing TEN songs heavy, your soul is in for something heavenly...though originally released in 1973, it's so strong and enduring, this music FAR RIVALS what is released in recent times...\n...Let's once more discover greatness...Starting this master works is the lively, positive \"ONLY FOR THE CHILDREN\", then comes beauty embracing gloom in \"COULD THIS BE THE END?\", this one really hits deep, a favorited cut. Another solid effort is the \"selfish\" \"LET THEM WORK IT OUT\", \"MAKE IT LAST\", is a wish to make a living fantasy last, so gentle a song...but my most loved work here is the almost vengeful \"PAY BACK IS A DOG\"..truly amazingly real..\"LOVE COMES EASY\" is so blissfully crafted with such a message that we all need..love this one real bad!!. Another knock out is the reassuring, airy, \"THERE'S NO REASON\" . Things get really lively with the title track \"ROCKIN' ROLL BABY\" simply dandy! Next is one of the most famous and loved songs ever!  \"YOU MAKE ME FEEL BRAND NEW,\" this is indeed the pinnacle of true art, I say no more!!  Finishing off is the brightly \"I WON'T GIVE YOU UP\"...and the package is complete..\nFor the R&B fan, this is a most essential addition to your collection, no regrets, no fillers, like fine wine, this album is rich, full bodied and mellow, very, very highly recommend because \"ROCKIN' ROLL BABY is very satisfying indeed...","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Ne-Yo is one of the most talented and maybe even underrated singers of the new generation.  He's a phenomenal writer having penned many hits for himself and others.  He's a true performer in that he can dance and dance very well.  He does not rely on gimmicks to sell his album or his talent.  On top of that he has one of the smoothest voices around that shows shades of the great Michael Jackson more often than you would like to admit.  Not to mention he has a sound that is unique to him.  However, he never really gets put in the upper echelon of singers and it's a shame.\n\nOn his 4th album, Libra Scale, Ne-Yo continues to hone his craft into something worth enjoying and experiencing for many years.  The album is groovy and smooth.  At ten tracks deep, some may gripe about the length of the album but I find it to be a perfect pace and values the quality over quantity.  I like it more when artists make a conscious effort to release an effort that is focused with an overall theme rather than try throw a bunch of songs on the album just because they've been recorded.  Libra Scale is said to have a storyline but I don't really hear a clear story line throughout the album and if it's there I think it's really loose interpretation of the word story.  Maybe this story is better told through videos.\n\nThere's a lot of \"sexy\" songs on this album including One In A Million, Crazy Love, Know Your Name, and the incredible Champagne Life.  There are 8 great songs on this album as I don't really care for the number one single Beautiful Monster because I think it's wack. As many know from my other reviews, I'm not too fond of the whole obligatory European night club techno song that has invaded R&B and Soul artists' albums.  Even though I do find the video to make the song better, I find the actual song unnecessary and forced.  When a talent like Ne-Yo can create Champagne Life then he doesn't need Beautiful Monster.  That right there is my opinion on the matter.  Also Cause I Said So is not a great track either.\n\nNe-Yo's Libra Scale is an album that is definitely worth adding to the collection.  It's well produced, written, and performed and the songs are highly enjoyable.  A few missteps prevent this from being a classic but as it stands it's still an extremely good album.  If you've liked Ne-Yo before then there should be no hesitation regarding this album.  You won't be disappointed one bit.  4 Stars.\n\n**The Deluxe Edition comes with a DVD, which features all 3 videos released so far and a 15 minute interview\/BTS with Ne-Yo.  It's nice to have, well done, and worth seeing at least once in my opinion but it's nothing essential. **","classification":4,"fold":6}

It is still very much alive.\nYet, here comes an immediate follow-up smash, \"The One\" featuring another dazzling vocal performance from Tamar, it samples Mtume's \"Juicy Fruit\" in as different and clever as Biggie Smalls \"Juicy\".

{"text":"I Dreamed a Dream (Susan Boyle) \/ B002XSWMU8\n\nI must have listened to the YouTube performance of Susan Boyle's stunning \"I Dreamed a Dream\" a hundred times, so I couldn't wait to buy this when it came out on Amazon. I really should have listened to the preview more closely, though, as this version is vastly different to her live performance and, in my personal opinion, the difference is not for the better.\n\nSusan Boyle's live performance was full of passion and depth and vibrato, like an opera singer at the height of her career. Yet all that passion and depth has been stripped out for this recorded version; it feels like someone insisted that she low-ball the song into something soft and 'safe' for elevator music and easy listening stations. Maybe that's what is wrong with the industry today - take a winning voice that stunned the world and rework it so that it's as bland and forgettable as everything else out there. *sigh*\n\nThere's nothing wrong with this version of \"I Dreamed a Dream\" - the vocals and music are very pretty. But in comparison to the performance we heard before... I know for a fact that this MP3 will sit unused on my computer while I reach for the YouTube version every time.\n\n~ Ana Mardoll","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"Black Magic by Little Mix is a quirky pop\/dance song that plays with the idea of attracting love through magic spells and\/or supernatural means. The online music video shows the girls going from bumbling to self-confident with the help of the occult in order to attract love(hence the title black magic). I understand that this song is meant to be light-hearted and not taken too seriously. However, the only thing that I must diplomatically comment on is that there is a scene in the video where the girls are targeting a love rival by making the suitor change his treatment towards her by using magic to change how she is perceived through smell. However, the love rival may have put on a public front of being snobby\/snotty, but she did not really do anything to harm any of the girls, which overlooks a negative karmic slant on using black magic on someone who did not really do you any real harm (even if for love). Yes, I understand that black magic (even if it involves just written words) is not necessary evil within itself and depends on intent (for instance a person using black magic to prevent and\/or disable their enemy and\/or enemies from doing them harm as long as they are not sending harmful\/evil energy back to their enemies is not in the same league as someone wishing someone else harm\/illwill out of jealousy and\/or towards a person who may have caused hurt in the past but is no longer doing any intentional harm to others.). However, the way that magic is used in the online video in fairness to the group describes what they mean by black magic. However, the ending could have at least shown the love rival ending up with someone else who is more matched for her than her previous boyfriend. Other than that caveat, Black Magic by Little Mix is a catchy pop dance song.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Counting Crows was my favorite band in high school and I've always stuck with them and always enjoyed hearing the direction that they take their music.  While \"Saturday Nights & Sunday Mornings\" took some time to grow on me, I'd actually now rank it as my second favorite album of theirs.\n\n\"Somewhere Under Wonderland\" is very different from anything Counting Crows has put out before.  There's still a connection to what made their fans fall in love with them way back in 1993, but there's a newness to their music...something fresh and different.  Sure, there's still the melancholy and longing that's been ever-present in their music, but there's less downtrodden tracks here.\n\nIs it the best thing they've ever produced?  Probably not.  But keep in mind this is really only their sixth album of original material in a 21-year period.  Many fans are so used to their classics that new songs will take time to become fan-favorites.  It will take time to become familiar with these songs and understand them and dissect them the way we have with songs from AaAE and RTS.  It will take time for these songs to become ingrained in our minds.\n\nBut hey, it happened with SN&SM.

This follows the club hit \"I'm a fire\" which topped Billboard's Hot dance club play charts (her 13th #1 there), in the process making her the only artist ever to have topped those charts in every decade from the seventies to date.\n\nWhile that effort was vintage Summer (very retro cool), \"Stamp your feet\" is very different, much more contemporary sounding; a player's anthem with a slight Hip hop\/Pop\/Dance feel (thankfully without a rapper in sight), stomping beats, electronic flourishes, and an incredibly catchy sing-a-long cheerleader-style chant and chorus. The lyrics (especially the free-form verbose verses) are fun, yet inspirational, urging on the down-and-out in life to get back up and into the game and win, using an athlete\/sportsman as a metaphor.\n\nAs ever, Summer shines vocally, (there's some slight vocoder effects) singing mainly in a lower register. The potential for this song is enormous, and if there's any justice, it should be a massive hit!\n\nCo-written by Summer with some young songwriters Greg Kurstin (Lily Allen, Kylie Minogue, P!nk) and Danielle Brisebois (Natasha Bedingfield, New Radicals, Kelly Clarkson), this is just one of the different colours (or sounds) Summer promises her new CD will contain, and with the two teasers off the album being this great, I can't wait to get my full box of \"Crayons\".\n\nP.S. er, Kayode, you'll have to download this for now... :-)","classification":5,"fold":6}
{"text":"Donell Jones is a bit of an anomaly in the world of soul music. He's well respected inside as well as outside of the business, but commercial success has eluded him from time to time. Part of the reason is his long intervals between albums (like Mint Condition long), and the fact that he was signed to LaFace Records in the mid 90's. Being that he was on LaFace, he always seemed like the odd man out. His music was decidedly East Coast on a Southern based label. Then there were his peers at LaFace: Usher, Toni Braxton, TLC, OutKast and Goodie Mob. It almost seemed as if he couldn't catch a break at times and when he did, it was due to his work with someone else. His biggest hits came from behind the scenes- writing Usher's \"Think Of You\" with Faith Evans and writing and producing 702's \"Get It Together\". His best album ironically became his worst selling album- 2006's \"Journey Of A Gemini\", an album that was all but given the cold shoulder by Jive Records. After ten years of dealing with major labels, Donell decided to go E1 Music for his new album, \"Lyrics\".\n\nIt's basically the same old Donell with his interesting and thought-provoking ruminations on love and relationships, such as the case with the song \"All About The Sex\". In the song, he pays tribute to a woman who has everything he's looking for, so there's no need to stray. On \"Imagine That\", he urges men to put themselves in a woman's position to see the error of their ways. The rather amusing \"Blackmail\" shows Donell sticking it to an ex about her past indiscretions shortly before her wedding day, while suggesting a little hush money for the trouble. He takes on the role of the other man in the ballad \"Backdoor\", while taking on social commentary on \"O How I Wonder\". The album starts to lose steam in the middle with the songs \"Stripclub\" featuring an unnecessary guest appearance from Yung Joc, the tepid \"What's Next\" and \"You Can Burn\" which features lead vocals solely performed by his protege Briana Fry. All of the songs are produced by Donell except the album's best song \"The Finer Things In Life\", which was written and produced by Mike City, who previously worked with Donell on \"Journey Of A Gemini\". Overall, this album is good but could have been better- much better if the songs \"Menage A Trois\", \"Don't Trip\" and the acoustic version of \"All About the Sex\" were on the album's final tracklisting, instead of being relegated to bonus tracks. Still in all, it's an album worth checking out.","classification":4,"fold":6}

Her folksy rendering of phrases like \"love changes everything\" and \"I was made to love you strongly\" hit the soul, not just the heart.  The simple melody is aural and raw, feeling like something you'd hear in the living room of a dear friend.  Amy's soft vocals, complete with subtle imperfections that add lovely character, rest easy on the ears like a child's lullaby.  I'd let her sing me to sleep any day.  So, grab a glass of wine or a cup of hot cocoa (spiked with something, of course) and cozy up by the fire with Stroup's music playing softly over the stereo.  It is a mood I'd give anything to feel every moment of every day.\n\nYeah, I can't wait to hear much, much more from this girl!","classification":5,"fold":6}

The songs are decent such as the lament on \"Timezone\" and the churning rock of \"Hanging On.\"  \"Staring Out to Sea\" is a strong pop song that does seem to have a motion of waves in the beat.  \"Make It Home\" has a good beat.

{"text":"There is no question that Jamie Foxx has had a strong set as a actor and singer. With acting, he had won a Oscar with Ray, paying tribute and delivering a strong performance as the late Ray Charles, and also with singing. But when it has came down to his latest single, it just doesn't feel like he was driven enough. Fall For Your Type, the lead single from his 4th album Best Night Of My Life isn't really a driven soul song. The song even though felt like it was incredibly dark, it didn't feel like he had brought in the seductive swagger he had shown in Unpredictable six years ago. I honestly think Jamie needs to rethink his music before he delivers again. It might've felt like he was falling. Not in the way he had shown to be for love, just falling down. Hopefully, he can redeem himself in singing. He has with his acting, but his singing is another story.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"I started liking Korn shortly after Life is Peachy was released and stayed an extremely loyal and devoted fan right up until Take a Look in the Mirror. Not saying that was a bad record by any means, but I just kind of lost my interest. Other Side was pretty good but a little too light and I don't even know what the hell that untitled album was.\n\nThis record however, brought back the original crunch without trying to remake their first two albums. It's heavy as all get out but it's still so different than anything they've done. My main draw was what they did with Jon's vocals. They're a little more up front in the mix and I really think that gives the songs a more reckless feel to them. I fell so in love with it that I listened to nothing but this for the next 5 days after buying it.\n\nIf you look at Korn's catalogue of music, each album is so different from the last. This is very rare in the music world. Especially for a band that has so unfairly been labeled as nu-metal, a genre of \"music\" that prides itself in not only having albums that sound alike, but also each song. Next to their first 2 records, this is definitely my favorite.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"TON returns to inject a major dose of truly exceptional musick into the basilar membrane which is both empowering and contemplative, considering the Rasputin theme and aestheics as well. The lyrical theme is entirely seperate to the aesthetic, which makes them both distinct unto themselves:\n\nMusick\n\nTrack List: 1. Dead Again 2. Tripping A Blind Man 3. The Profits Of Doom 4. September Sun 5. Halloween in Heaven 6. These Three Things 7. She Burned Me Down 8. Some Stupid Tomorrow 9. An Ode To Locksmiths 10. Hail And Farewell To Britain\n\nDead Again preserves their evocatively best style, with rhythmically crunching and echoing guitars, haunting cathedral keyboards, the darkly erotic inunciations and deep reverberations from Peter Steele, and the hypnotic beat of the drums all combine to create another Goth-Metal masterpiece akin to Bloody Kisses. As is typical TON, each song takes its time, coursing and describing the emotions, while stimulating a sense of sweet euphoria.\n\nOf note, The Profit of Doom, dealing with The Antichrist Beast of Revelation complete with references to the six triumverate; Halloween In Heaven, a jaunty tune featuring a female voice {Tara VanFlower of Lycia} complimenting Steele's well with a pleasing contrast. September Sun, & These Three Things combine ponderous ballad moments with sudden bursts of energy creating a perfect mix of melancholy and rage.\n\nAlso, I was pleasantly surprised to find an additional disc contained inside with a Live recording featuring tracks from Bloody Kisses {Christian Woman, Love You To Death, Black No. 1}, October Rust {Everything Dies \/ My Girlfriend's Girlfriend}, Slow Deep & Hard, {Gravitational Constant}, and Origin of The [...]{Are You Afraid}, all of which sounds extraordinary.\n\nOverall, Dead Again contains a mutiplicity of content from the art {even the thorny vines on the CD itself is a very nice touch} to the quantity of music, which hearkens to Bloody Kisses and October Rust while standing upon its own merit. Highly recommended.\n\nAesthetics\n\nThe cover art features Grigori Efimovich Rasputin, Mystic, so called \"Holy Devil\" and \"Mad Monk\", deriving from The Khlysty, a sect who practiced self-flagellation, although he disagreed with their masochistic methods and basically became a renegade monk with a penchant for carnal indulgence - from imbibing in copious libations, passionate dance {it was rumored that he even celebrated a phallic cavort with the legendary ample appendage} , to sensual pleasures with many of the local women who admired his extraordinary abilities, as well as his libertine lifestyle, in which he revelled, and was more than willing and able to satisfy on a frequent basis.\n\nHis influence pervaded the Russian Aristocracy, wherein he had the Czar and Czarina transfixed. Briefly, extremely fortunate for them, he attained the power to heal, and used that ability to cure the Czar's son Alex, which gained their unyielding loyalty. From the beginning, there were those who resented him, claiming he was in league with The Devil. Through treachorous subterfuge, he was tricked and betrayed, and eventually excarnated after displaying apparent invincibility, to the fear and trepidation of his detractors.\n\nHe lived his life to the fullest, attained a passionate joie de vivre, employing lesser magic principles to charm and confound when it served his purposes, and excelled in his chosen endeavors, all of which designates him a de-facto Satanist, in My estimation.\n\nThe back cover features the images of Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia and Alex, the unfortunate royal children who were assassinated {with the exception of Maria, who would later write a book entitled \"Rasputin: The Man Behind The Myth\"} in Yekaterinburg (Sverdlovsk) on 16th July 1918, by the filthy hands of stuporstitious peasants wanting to rid the kingdom of anything to do with Rasputin. The ignorant frightened cowards.\n\nThe green font used on the entire album can be a bit distracting, which is something of a Russian version of the English alphabet, with several reversed letters. Also mentionable, the booklet is a fold-out cross design containing full lyrics and liner notes.","classification":5,"fold":6}

But for Whitney Houston doing it back in 1991, she made it more dominant than what Francis Scott Key could've ever imagined. It came on the heels of the Persian Gulf War, and hearing how bold and somber it is, sadly after Whitney had died, it is a unparalleled trademark of why someone is that strong. Whitney dominated that song beyond what words could've ever said, and that lightning in a bottle will never be replicated.

Whitney Houston will be missed, and definitively never forgotten.\n\nWhitney Houston 1963-2012\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"There is definitely something rockin' here. The song made #12 on the American charts and #8 on the\nBritish charts. Rolling Stone Magazine, in 2004, put this song at #499 in the top  500 greatest songs\nof all time. In 2005, Q magazine place it at #38 on its list of 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. Yes, it should\nbe.\n\nThe reason? Great almost-poetic lyrics by Phil Lynott, hitting his peak, and dynamite intertwined guitar\nleads, all done with a working man's sensibility. The twin guitar leads were essentially a trademark of\nThin Lizzy, after 1975, and helped the band stand apart from the rest of the rock 'n' roll pack. The lead\nand rhythm guitar  playing uses very sharp crisp chords that pulsate and propel the song. Wait for the\nsparse twin guitar lead as the rest of the band lays back; then the singer comes back in as the twin\nleads repeat their riff underscoring the lyrics and subsequently the Boys bravado.\n\nThe song was released in 1976 and featured a black Irish lead singer\/bass player and a mixed band of\nProtestant and Catholic musicians. Talk about cross cultural influences, this band was it. Amazingly\nthe song was used at the 2012 Republican Convention to introduce the Vice-Presidential candidate to\nthe stage. Again, the Republicans used a song unauthorized (Reagan and \"Born In The USA\") and was\ncriticized for its use. This was objected to by the Lynott family citing that Lynott would have objected\nto the anti-gay policies of the party and never let them use it for political purposes.\n\nNonetheless, this song sounds immediate no matter how many times it is played. This is why it has been\nused in countless movies, television commercials and sporting events. The energy on this song, displayed\nby the band, keeps you glued to your air guitar and keeps you wondering if the song will have a different\nending each time you play it. To me it always seems fresh and exciting; in one word, timeless, and that,\nto me, is what a great rock 'n' roll song is all about.","classification":5,"fold":6}

New Day Rising is sort of like Zen Arcade meets their later, but still brilliant, poppier work. It's not as dark as Zen Arcade, but it has just as much power and emotion. But probably the most stunning thing about this album is that it was made over 15 years ago, and it does not sound dated one bit. New Day Rising blows away the crap that tries to be passed off as music these days. \"Celebrated Summer,\" \"59 Times The Pain,\" \"Terms Of Psychic Warfare,\" \"If I Told You,\" \"Folklore,\" \"I Don't Know What You're Talking About,\" and \"Plans I Make\" should blow your mind. And while the production may sound lacking at first (the drums sound kind of muffled at times), it actually does the album justice upon further listening. Forget the marketed fake angst of much of today's rock and listen to New Day Rising. This is arguably the best Husker album out there.

{"text":"Though MASH sometimes floated a bit between drama and comedy a lot. I would say it was a dramedy but i hate when people add two words like that together. I personally didn't like MASH as much as my siblings, it wasn't until I got older and was off to college that I started to watch the reruns late in the evening, the ones where Klinger didn't wear dresses anymore. Klinger actually became my favorite character. I guess at that point I started paying more attention to it, and was also more forgiving of the relentless puns. some of those were so cringe-worthy that I would want to leave the room. I always thought the song was cool, but it wasn't until i learned later that it had words to it. after hearing it with vocals, I started paying more attention to the show itself. also whenever the instrumental played I could now feel the inate sadness behind it. Very good song.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I've heard this song in the background of my daily life since it was released last year.  Then I finally decided to sit down and listen to it.  It has all of the marks of a pop song: Catchy beat, redundant lyrics, and a short run-time.\n\nSo why do I give it five stars?  This song will give you an ear-worm like you won't believe, thanks to the very Polynesian-sounding chorus in the background, and the upbeat music is very offset by the decidedly melancholy tone of the lyrics, which are surprisingly dark (inferring that being dead isn't that much different than living a sham relationship).\n\nBe warned, though -- there are NO GOOD REMIXES of this song that I've found, because every single one of them seems to take half of what makes this song so appealing (the chorus) and drops it in favor of a disappointing dub-step.  Stick with this, the original!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"They have been wowing audiences now for nearly six decades.  The group was formed in Brooklyn, NY in 1957 and was originally known as The Chesters.  Just a year or so later they changed their name to The Imperials and ultimately to Little Anthony and the Imperials.  Led by lead singer Anthony Gourdine the group would make some of the most memorable R&B singles of the early 1960s.  Perhaps the best known of these is the moving Goin Out Of My Head from 1964.  I think we can all relate when Little Anthony cries out I see you each morning, but you just walk past me, you don't even notice I exist.

{"text":"Four years after the release of their highly successful self-titled album, the most prominent Christian rock band from Texas -- Flyleaf -- have reunited with producer Howard Benson to dish out their long-awaited sophomore effort, \"Memento Mori.\" While the first album had more of a garage band edge to it, the follow-up finds the band shedding away some of their punkier second-rate Nirvana influences in favor for a much more polished and radio-ready sound. This should come as no surprise though, as Flyleaf are one of those rare rock bands nowadays who can sell a record and since their debut was a bit raw and immature.\n\nTouring heavily with the likes of Korn and Disturbed has done little to soften the band's strong Christian themes. In fact, on \"Memento Mori,\" such moments are much clearer than ever. For some this could be a turn-off, but for the (ahem) faithful followers, it may be a plus. Put plain and simple, Lacey loves Jesus and wants to make sure you know all about it. Putting that aside, though, the album is certainly a notch above the first as far as musicianship goes. While the band has yet to establish a distinctive style, they back up Lacey's broad themes and unique voice well, and Benson's improved production only serves to give the whole affair more bombast and sonic improvements. Put simply, this is the same Flyleaf you know already, just marginally improved and perfected.\n\nIf \"Memento Mori\" has one fatal flaw, though, it's that the songs tend to blend into one another without a single moment sticking out. While there isn't necessarily a bad song to be found, it can be an overall taxing album to listen to and certainly begs the question of whether or not it will continue Flyleaf's string of success. At the end of the day, their second effort improves on almost all fronts, leaving memorable song-writing on the back-burner. Chalk it up to a burnt-out producer (seriously, what album HASN'T Howard Benson produced this year?) and a slightly immature band. Hopefully album number three irons out some of the wrinkles, but in the meantime, this will suffice.\n\nThe deluxe edition features four bonus tracks: \"Break Your Knees,\" \"Enemy,\" \"Have We Lost\" and \"Who Am I\". \"Break Your Knees\" and \"Have We Lost\" sound like it would fit right in with the first album, while \"Enemy\" meanders along rather blandly. \"Who Am I,\" on the other hand, sticks out and would probably make a good single -- if it weren't for the fact that it is so short. These tracks are worth owning for the fans who can't get enough of the band, but don't neccessarily improve the album as a whole. Take 'em or leave 'em.","classification":4,"fold":6}

Joe Cocker was one of those soulful greats that had a very uncanny, sweet & somber style that not only has been so timeless, but his songs have never gotten old, no matter how much the music industry changed. Yet, it tragically has been over a year since Joe Cocker passed on from lung cancer, from the years of drug and alcohol abuse he had gone through in his personal and professional life. Still, when I do think of Joe Cocker, I definitely think of the sweet and somber songs that he had recorded for years, and You Can Leave Your Hat On, has been one of those upbeat songs that not only show Joe was still standing at a very tough time in his life, beating addiction, but also personally as Joe finally found his lifelong partner Pam. He definitely showed a lot of heart and soul in the soul, and recorded a very upbeat and soulful song, definitely worth his soul. If you never heard a Joe Cocker song, than this is one I recommend you download.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"I'll admit it, I love Joe Satriani. In all seriousness, he was the driving force that pushed me to play guitar as an awkward Midwestern teenager. I'd been playing for two years prior to hearing Joe, but once I heard Surfing With The Alien when I was 14 years old I felt like I'd been rechristened with the task of becoming one hell of a guitar slinger. You see, Satriani wasn't like those other guys. The dudes in spandex and White Rain-hardened hair were out to play as fast as they could, melody be damned. It was all about speed, not nuance. Joe could do both, and wearing jeans and a t-shirt. He threw in sci fi, film, and literary elements in his music as well. Kurt Vonnegut, The Silver Surfer, and Blade Runner were all inspirations for his music. Joe Satriani was a beacon for the nerds and geeks, whether they(or he) realized it or not.\n\nOver the years, he's put out a steady stream of albums. Some better than others, but always a solid group of tunes. Shockwave Supernova is his newest guitar opus and Joe has found a really comfortable spot musically on this one. He's left the singing at the door and is concentrating on making the best guitar instrumentals he can. At 59 years old, he can still outplay anybody out there and can still create earworm melodies that won't leave your head for days. Recorded with longtime producing partner John Cuniberti, Satriani headed into Skywalker Studios and made one of his best sounding records in ten years.\n\nJoe has a style all his own. His songs aren't dummy tracks that he can fly across the fretboard over for five minutes. He creates mood and feel before laying the mind-melting solos down first, and opening track \"Shockwave Supernova\" does just that. The song sounds like some massive sci-fi epic. You can almost see the chromed-out space craft traveling at light speed across the universe as this track blows into your earholes. There's some great slide playing in this one, as well as some patented Middle-Eastern flair in the solo. \"Lost In A Memory\" harkens back to Flying In A Blue Dream territory. It's spacious, moody, and really accentuates Joe's knack for creating an emotional pocket we can get lost in. \"Crazy Joey\" is a fun as hell kind of song. Some serious face-melting picking technique in there as well that will send guys like me down to the basement and practice for hours(or until we're told to come upstairs.) \"On Peregrine Wings\" is a monster rock tune with some seriously meaty riffs.\n\nThere's also some great laid back moments, such as the blues shuffle of \"San Francisco Blue\" and \"Scarborough Stomp\". Both pay tribute to the Bay area that Satriani has called home since he was 20 years old. Joe can also create beautiful pieces of music, much like a classical composer creates sonatas and airy chamber music. \"Butterfly and Zebra\" is a short-but-sweet piece that reminds one of something like Surfing's \"Midnight\".  \"Stars Race Across The Sky\" has a melancholy vibe with some great piano to accompany Joe's nuanced guitar lines.\n\nShockwave Supernova is a solid musical outing for 'ol Satch. I don't think anything Joe puts out now will ever recapture that magic of hearing Surfing With The Alien for the first time when I was 14. And really, that's pretty unfair of a longtime fan to expect. Though, something you can expect and count on from Joe Satriani is a solid group of tunes each time out. Shockwave Supernova is just that, and easily his best album in ten years.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"4th album from U.K. band emphasizes their more volatile, heavy art-punk side by pumping out\n  explosive, hard, abrasive post-Britpop with a terse, sandpaper edge of dissonance--mixed with\n  almost unexpected melodic twists.  Jagged guitar roars and avant-punk rhythm structures lend\n  an air of innovative danger and power to the underlying pop elements.  \"Four\" is a surprising\n  powerhouse of risky, tempered aggression that sometimes finds its soft side.

{"text":"There is a surprising dedication to the music of Franz Liszt in the catalog of The Bach Guild. There isn't the drive and dedication that one finds when examining composers who were of complete interest to the Solomon Brothers (like Bach, Handel or Haydn). The clues left in the catalog lead one to a simple conclusion: pianists love Liszt. And as pianists were gathered in the 50 year active recording history of The Bach Guild\/Vanguard Classics, they gathered enough negotiation power to record one for them.\n\nSo, the end result is that tucked into the Vanguard catalog are several hours of wonderful Liszt recordings. Only one orchestral recording, only one of the concerti, but many hours of superb piano performances from Alfred Brendel, Jeanne-Marie Darre, Russell Sherman and Earl Wild.\n\nTo the meticulous and collectors among our followers, you won't find much here that has been difficult to find. Emil Gilelss performance of the Liszt has been out of print on CD for 20 years, and is not available digitally so thats a treat for all concerned. The Hungarian Rhapsodies performed by the Vienna State Opera Orchestra is well-known to collectors for its sound quality, and a few CDs have floated around the marketplace, but as with the Gilels, this represents the digital debut of these fine recordings.\n\nBut the other Liszt performances, due mainly to the high visibility of the performers, has not been hidden away in the vaults.  We have included all the works, so there are a few instances of repeated works.\n\nBut never has all of it been compiled and placed in one simple, accessible set.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"This is an extremely unusual rendition of \"Silent Night,\" performed on the acoustic guitar, and I must admit that I needed to listen to it six or seven times before it started to grow on me.  During the introduction, I thought John Fahey was attempting to play the song with a hint of a Hawaiian influence, but then the stylistic influences seemed to come into the song from a multitude of directions, almost to the point that the song seemed to lack cohesion in places.\n\nDo I want \"Silent Night\" played in this fashion?  Maybe not.  But I'll keep it around because it is fascinating to listen to the multitude of musical techniques he uses.  There is no doubt that Mr. Fahey was an extremely talented musician, and I enjoyed listening to the sheer artistry and creativity that went into recording the song.  I'm glad it was offered as a free download, so Ill be generous and round it up my rating to four stars.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"For an all too brief period in the mid 1960's Petula Clark was a major force on both the Billboard Hot 100 and on Top 40 radio as well. Born in Epsom England in 1932, Petula Clark made her entrance into show business at a very young age. In fact she hosted her very own radio show \"Pet's Parlour\" at the age of 11 and made her debut on the British charts way back in 1954. At the tender age of 22 Petula Clark would become a major recording star in Britain. She maintained a constant presence on the British charts for the next decade and was a major star throughout Europe as well. Then lightning struck in early 1965 when \"Downtown\" went all the way to #1 on the U.S. pop charts. Just a few months later Warner Brothers released the follow-up single \"I Know A Place\". The song was nearly as big a hit as \"Downtown\" in the U.S. peaking at #3 and would earn Petula Clark a Grammy for \"Best Rock & Roll Female Vocal\" of 1965.  A memorable vocal performance!","classification":5,"fold":6}

I've always been more of a casual fan of these guys compared to Rob, but after hearing this album, man, I did not expect them to deliver a great album, but they have!\n\nI can't remember the last time I heard an album I listened to from start to finish without skipping a track or two... but even when I almost did about two times on this album, I didn't! After hearing the whole album now, there is only about 2 tracks I don't think where that great, but for the most part every song on this album has gotten at minimum a 3\/5 rating from me. A first in quite some time!\n\nIt's also funny, because a lot of this album goes against what I do like, so Powerman 5000 have definitely proven themselves as being able to utilize sounds and effects that usually just give me an instant headache and put me in a bad mood that anybody is allowed to use them at all, but these guys have gotten away with it!\n\nMy only criticism is saying good luck trying to play some of these songs live, as there is quite alot of effects, echoes, mixing, you name it, everything seems to have been used.\n\nI was already impressed and rockin to the album on the first listen up until track 5 (builders of the future), then dreaded techno noises kicked in, and I cringed, however, by the time the song was over, it wasn't that bad! I give it 3 stars, but I do know there is an audience for it, and it wouldn't surprise me if that song charts! It's the kind of thing that would these days. Not my cup of tea personally, but like I said, I give it 3 stars, which is high considering I usually give techno -1 stars before even hearing it. That song wouldn't surprise me if it charts, the people who like a majority of what chart music is today love the song, then look confused when they hear the rest of Powerman 5000's material. It seems to be a song that doesn't quite fit in with the rest of Powerman 5000's back catalog, but yet it's not so far out of place I would say it does not belong on the album or anything.\n\nThe second half of the album kicks off with a slow number ( I want to kill you), which was putting me to sleep until the chorus kicked in and I just got what it was about. Interesting, but not something I will listen to much in future. After that was up and down of 3 to 4 star material!\n\nExcellent work from Powerman 500 here. Like I said before, I've been a casual fan, mostly due to only finding a couple of tracks from previous albums that I loved, but this album here, this has moved up Powerman in my favorite bands list. To me, this is certainly the best overall album the band has done. I may not have found a new favorite song by these guys to replace \"Blast Off\" or \"Nobody's Real\" but something on this album is definitely going to grow on me soon enough to become my 3rd favorite... and probably 4 to 10 as well!\n\nBUY IT!","classification":4,"fold":6}
{"text":"No, Beyonce or J.Lo. did not make this song, nor is it in yo face sexual. Nope, just good old fashioned fun and dance. And it's catchy, whether this is a good thing, since it got it from its over simplistic nature, is a different story.\n\nThis could be the surprise song of the year, in a year full of surprises, because let's admit it, did anybody see this song becoming a national hit? I think it says something about the state of dance music. I mean, any top 10 hit is given a BPM, and sent to the clubs, and sometimes your radio. These songs are cheap shots at great music, and I take them as an insult. I mean, I can't tell whether we're supposed to dance or laugh at these \"re-mixes.\"\n\n\"Shake It\" is simple on the verses, which is typical of Metro Station, but they bring it on the chorus, and they bring it home in a big way. The chorus is catchy, fun, happy and it could start a new dance craze, if their was more of a dance to create.\n\nSo overall, the verses aren't that great, but the chorus is what makes the song. It might not be original, but it's fun. Here's to the continued success of \"Shake It\" and Metro Station.

{"text":"This is a great & fantastic CD release by the talented, prolific singer-songwriter & King of R n' B, Robert Kelly, titled, \"Love Letter\". This Great CD opens with \"Love Letter (Prelude)\", a beautiful & soulful 'al cappella' track, voicing being greatful for the support he received during his recent troubles with the law & as well as more about the great music in this CD. \"Love Letter\" is the next great track : great drum kit sound, laid-back track with great vocals (title track). \"Love Letter Christmas\" is great remix of the title track. \"Number One Hit\" is another great track (electro-R n' B track, great bass\/drums combination & great clear vocals). Other great tracks include \"Just Can't Get Enough\" (soul sound & soulful vocals), \"Radio Message\" (Great vocals & very persuasive lyrics, singer pleading very convincingly, \"Baby come back\"), \"Love Is\" (great vocals & harmonies, featuring K. Michelle) & \"You Are Not Alone\" (a hidden track on my CD, great effort & interpretation by Robert Kelly of the classic song he wrote for Michael Jackson, a well fitting tribute to the great fallen musician. His vocals don't fully match Michael Jackson's, but is nevertheless a great effort, tribute & his own interpretation of the this great song). Good tracks include \"Not Feelin' The Love\", \"Taxi Cab\", \"Just Like That\" (great guitar intro & bass\/drum combination) & \"Music Must Be A Lady\" (great orchestral intro, the track starts quite greatly but does fail to keep its greatness as it goes on). \"Lost In Your Love\" is a solid track\/gem : a beautiful grand piano sound, fantastic melody, wonderful bass\/drum combination, great chorus, harmonies & lyrics. He declares \"Baby tonight I wanna be lost in your love\", very convincingly. \"When  A Women Loves\" is another solid track\/gem : probably inspired by Percy Sledge's classic, \"When A Man Loves A Woman\". The song has a beautiful melody, great high pitched vocals & persuasive lyrics. He proclaims a woman, \"She loves for real... She fills my soul\". \"How Do I Tell Her?\" is a masterpiece of a song : beautiful orchestral background\/base track, very melodical, 'heartbreaking' lyrics & vocals. The song also has well matched rhythm guitar, grand piano & a nice saxophone near the end. The singer fading singing, \"Bye bye baby...bye bye baby...\", what a gem of a song! This is my favourite track from this fantastic CD & hence the title of my review. This great CD has no weak track to really talk of. On overall, this is a great & fantastic CD release by the talented, Chicago (IL) born, Robert Kelly, a highly recommended listening. The King of R n' B is back with a bang! A great early Christmas gift to his loyal fans!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"And I don't think she's writing any of her material but that's OK for now. She just started out.\n\nBut my point with the title was that Tattoo was safe. So safe that it bored me. I think I thought it was \"cute\" the first time I heard it but I still haven't seen the video and I don't care. I don't think I'll ever care for that song EVER.\n\nAnd that's fine with me.\n\nBut this single...I heard it a few times and was like \"I like it. I really do.\"\n\nIt's much more...her. I think. Still don't \"know\" the girl! But it just seems a bit less predictable. Sure, this love thing is tried and true to death, but this song is catchier to me, the production a LOT nicer (like a floating, \"this can't be real\" kinda feel) and it shows more vocal power. I will say at the end though, Jordin literally shrieks a note and it's just too loud. That could've been left out but if you don't mind belting, then this song is good pop music.\n\nThe vibe, playful and youthful (the eldest, Chris is only 18 after all).\n\nAnd even though some of you are sick to DEATH of him (me excluded), Chris does a good vocal job here too. After hearing the SMASH, \"With You\" and a few of his older tracks, I can tell that even though they had no hand in the writing of this track, that at least Chris feels his part. Surely, Jordin does too.\n\nI wish her luck in the future although I heard her album wasn't that great. Guess I didn't miss much!\n\n3.9 stars (compared to the measly 2.25 i awarded the first single, Tattoo).\n\nEnd note: I like Jordin. She's a sweety, got's a good set of pipes and she's damn pretty. However, I did have many gripes with her actually winning because although she was more marketable than Melinda (who got ROBBED!!!!!!), she didn't have the pipes like her nor quite like Lakisha.\n\nIt was sad.\n\nBut she won. It's over. Great voice. Hope to see her co-write 2 songs (at least) next go round and I wish her happiness. No surprises here.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"I love this song. Of all the slow songs Elton John has done this one has to be the most unique of the bunch. It has that 80's New York blues feel to it and plays with chord progressions that move in unexpected places; making a melody that is both complex and familiar. Elton's singing is at its best here. The song takes me to places when I hear it. He sings like a smooth and mellow crooner, giving a little edge just where the song needs it. I am baffled this track wasn't included in any of the greatest hits collections. It was a top ten song on the UI.K. and and top 15 in the U.S.\n\nIf you love ballads or mellow songs that are a cut different than your standard pop tune that are still catchy and beautiful you must do yourself a favor and check out Blue Eyes.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"A critic from The Washington Post called this song \"a power ballad without much power,\" which I thought was funny, but not entirely fair. Of all 12 songs currently on hit radio, this one carries the most force because it is the only song patient enough to allow for a slow build-up of instrumentation (and in particular drums) and because it stays out of Rihanna's way and lets her blast us with layers of her full-throated vocals.\n\nLyrically, melodically, instrumentally, it's at best ho-hum.

{"text":"This is my introduction to Frazey Ford's music.  I saw it in new releases, sampled it and ordered.  Two of the tracks here are strong favorites of mine.  The opener \"September Rain\" laces a catchy breeze of a melody that percolates like hot water over coffee with Frazey's expressive vocals delivering a powerful punch, \"Do you ache in your body and your mind?\"  \"Done\" is an incredible track.  I punch repeat play and listen to it about four times each time I spin this disc.  \"I was taking every hit from a drive-by shooting son of a *****; and I'm done, oh oh I'm done.  Who told you that you could rewrite the rules and take me for a GD fool cause I'm done?*\"  The sass and defiance make this a classic breakup track.  The rest of the set has yet to connect with me.

{"text":"From the opening notes of \"Wrecking Ball\", this CD is pure Terri Clark. it is an upbeat, rocking number with clever lyrics, driving guitar, with just enough fiddle. \"Breakin' Up Thing\" is about a guy with 'no respect for the human heart', it is a mid-tempo song with a smattering of pedal steel, not quite a kiss-off song, it is more from the side of the kissee. \"The One\" is a slower song, about what she wants in a relationship: 'I don't need a love that I can live with, I want the one I can't live without'. \"Northern Girl\" could be the anthem for a whole generation of young ladies from Canada! Four of the tracks were co-written with Kristen Hall, formerly of Sugarland, including my favorite: \"Beautiful and Broken\". I love the banjo and accordion. \"Lonesome's Last Call\" sounds straight out of 1978 with the weepy fiddle\/pedal steel intro and story of two lonely souls who happen to find each other. A broken relationship is the story of \"The Good Was Great\". \"Smile\" is an emotional tribute to Clark's mother and features Alison Krauss, it put a lump in my throat. \"We're Here For a Good Time\" is a cover of the old Trooper song about having a good time, even when it's raining. The album closes with a Celtic-inspired song about the futility of planting \"Flowers in the Snow\". It's a shame that Terri Clark is not more popular, her music has so much more heart and depth than the other stuff being released to country radio right now.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"This past year we have already lost a lot of legends in music whom have died before their time and fell to the waste side before our eyes, from Prince to David Bowie and Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire. This year has honestly been a tragic year for legends. But some of them have had so much to celebrate over the years, like this year for Phil Collins, whom had stepped away from the music industry for quite awhile to take care of some health problems. Well, now he is making a return to the industry, and celebrating his music all over. But anyway, he also celebrated some huge milestones this year, celebrating the 35th anniversary of his solo debut Face Value, and the 30th anniversary of him winning Album Of The Year at The Grammy awards for his No Jacket Required album. But when he was going to re-release all of his studio albums again, he had a lot of albums being celebrated, but was taking a step back on one album, and changing it to a different record.\n\nThe Essential Going Back, is more like a recreation of his 2010 album Going Back, where Phil Collins recorded a lot of classic standards and covers of songs he had grown up listening to, and celebrated the music of soul in the 60's and 50's. But fort this re-release of the original 2010 Going Back album, which had two versions, Phil decided instead to reduce the tracks being re-released instead of releasing all the tracks from both of his 2010 versions. Still, you do get some really good tracks being remastered like (Love Is Like A) Heatwave, his rendition of Stevie Wonder's Uptight, his soulful rendition of Some Of Your Lovin' and a driven rendition of The Temptations standard Papa Was A Rolling Stone. There also are some live songs which were never released as original recordings on the studio album a soulful cover of The Temptations hit My Girl and Too Many Fish In The Sea. Yet, the downside to this release for die hard Phil Collins fans whom have bought the earlier versions of Going Back released in 2010 is that there were a lot of good songs that were cut out of the re-release like In My Lonely Room, a soulful cover of Standing In The Shadows Of Love and Jimmy Mack to name a few songs.\n\nStill, despite a few songs being overlooked, which Phil Collins intentionally said he would do, because he felt the deluxe version and even the original version would be a little too much of a hassle being re-released as a album, The Essential Going Back is a good buy for mainly the die hard Phil Collins fans where the live tracks are worth the while, but for newcomers to Phil Collins music, they might want to take the step back and listen to the original album versions, regular and deluxe from 2010 to get a better ear of what Phil had made musically from his soul first, before they sink their teeth into The Essential Going Back. Still, it is a good buy for hard core Phil Collins fans that is nobly worth the dollar.\n\nAlbum Cover: B\n\nSongs: C+\n\nPrice: B-\n\nMastering & Remastering: B 1\/2-\n\nOverall: B-","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"This album generally continues in the style of their breakthrough album, Silver Side Up, but there is some experimentation, such as mellow songs \"Feelin' Way too Damn Good\" and \"Should've Listened\", and songs with guitar solos and a strange ethereal atmosphere \"Do This Anymore (one of the best)\".  All the material is easily as well written and good as the first 2 albums, though there is an obvious radio single with \"Someday\".  The band has pushed their sound to new extremes, shown by the actually-pretty-heavy almost metal sound of \"Flat on the Floor\".  The drummer is also more featured, this time using some quick + fast double bass patterns that he didn't show he could do before now.  Overall, a solid step in the right direction for Nickelback.  True their is only so much they can do with their poppish grunge-influenced sound, but I think that without changing their sound, this is the best they could do.  I praise Nickelback for being the only popular band I know that stays good on their second major popular CD.  Even Staind and Korn suck now.  The only dissapointment is that there's nothing like my favorite Nickelback song \"Woke up this Morning\" on here.  They should make more songs like that.\n\nRecommended if you like Nickelback.  Some might think it's too poppy.\n\nIn retrospect I'd rate this album 4 stars.  Only releases with no bad songs and few noticable flaws get 5.","classification":5,"fold":6}
{"text":"Not being a huge Depeche Mode fan but loving quite a few of their songs, VIOLATOR is the one album I loved and I will probably completely download the digital version of the album as well as other Depeche Mode tracks from various original vinyl albums.  I have never cared for the singles so much as the album versions of their songs, so this is the best way to do that.  Yes I had quite a few LP's from DM but for the most part I ended up recording audio cassettes of my favorite tracks in the order I liked them, save the Violator album.  Amazon makes doing this easy and the quality of these digital tracks are perfection.  Usually album-oriented, this is somewhat against my usual grain, but in the cases such as this, where a handful of songs will suffice, you can't argue with the price!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"There are now a whole bunch of classical Christmas mp3s on Amazon that offer a hundred or more tracks of Xmas favorites for about a buck. Several of these are pretty good, but this is one with a difference--and one you shouldn't miss. What makes this album special is the rich concentration of important and beautiful choral works found within its nearly 10 hours and 192 tracks. Many of this pieces are very hard to find, and given that most of these recordings must date from the 1950s or 1960s, the sound is remarkably good. Performance standard are consistently high, with beautiful solo singing and choral ensembles.\nUnfortunately amazon gives us no composer names, so it's not easy to know what you're getting. After some research, I can provide at least a partial list of some of the complete choral works on this album. Starting with track numbers, these include:\n1. Jean Mouton - Noe, Noe, Psallite Noe\n2. Anonymous (Gregorian Chant) - Veni Redemptor Gentium; Balthasar Resinarius, Johann Eccard & Andreas Raselius - Nun komm der Heiden Heiland (4 settings)\n3. Anonymous (English 15th c.) - Nova, Nova; Anonymous (Czech 15th c.) - Salve, Lux Fidelium; Jacob Obrecht - Magnificat\n4. Anonymous (16th c.) - Joseph Est Bien Mari; Anonymous (15th c.) - Marvel not, Joseph; Johann Walther - Joseph lieber Joseph mein\n5. Tomas Luis de Victoria - O Magnum Mysterium; Francesco Guerrero - Virgen Santa; Anonymous (Spanish 16th c.) - Riu, Riu, Chiu\n6. Michael Praetorius - Wie schn leuchtet der Morgenstern; Francesco Guerrero - Los Reyes Siguen La Estrella; Clemens Non Papa - Vox In Rama\n7. Michael Praetorius - Quem Pastores Laudavere; John Attley - Sweet Was The Song The Virgin Sung; William Byrd - Lullaby\n8: Buxtehude: Magnificat Anima Mea\n9: Haydn: Catilena pro Adventu\n10-28: Schtz: Historia der Geburt Jesu Christi (Story of the Birth of Jesus Christ)\n38-61: Caldara: Vaticini di Pace (Christmas Cantata)\n62: Alessandro Scarlatti: Cantata Pastorale per la Nativita di Nostro Signore Gesu Cristo\n72-133: Bach: Christmas Oratorio (--that's right, Bach's complete Christmas Oratorio, covering more the 60 tracks!)\n154-166: Tchaikovsky: Nutcracker (Substantial selections)\n177-189: Monteverdi: Magnificat\n190: Schtz: Magnificat\n191: Palestrina: O Magnum Mysterium\n192: Purcell: Behold, I Bring You Glad Tidings (Anthem, Z 002)\nBoth Schtz works are gorgeous, as are the pieces by Buxtehude, Haydn, Caldara, Monteverdi, and the closing anthem by Purcell-- all of which were previously unknown to me. Helmut Rilling, who went on to record Bach's complete cantatas, is at the helm for several of these performances.\nThere are also selections from Handel's Messiah and Bach's Magnificat--and a few other Bach pieces-- scattered throughout the album (I would rather have seen them concentrated in one place).\nI would strongly recommend this for the wonderful and hard to find choral works listed above. And the popular carols aren't bad either. I downloaded this a few hours ago and have been listening to it non-stop every since! Enjoy....","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"If there is honestly one thing that I do love about The Beatles after all this time, is that they have delivered the best in stamina and strength in song. Now, with a whole new generation of people discovering their music, now that it is finally available for downloading, I would honestly they still are the most influential in regards to the harmonies and rock that still have driven for years. John, Paul, George and Ringo have made some of the most remarkable albums in their career as one, and so many dynamic songs over the years on their own as well. One of the last songs that they have recorded together, Hey Jude is honestly one of those songs that still shows that their influence is honestly more wider and strong than most of today's artists. The song was written in regards to the divorce of John Lennon and his first wife, Cynthia, whom sadly just passed away after a deep battle with cancer. It was said to Julian Lennon, John's son that he was made to stand stronger after travesty, and it is a enduring song that still is worth the while. This song is one song that I sincerely do recommend if you have never heard a Beatles song.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"I love Christmas albums. I have several in my household, ranging from A Charlie Brown Christmas to a Bobby Sherman Christmas. I also have Mitch Miller's famous one, along with Phil Spector's Christmas Album. And I can safely say that this album can stand with those easily.  Bob Dylan's Christmas in the Heart is one of the best Christmas albums I've ever heard.\n\nThere is a tendency by people to mock this album even before hearing it. Bob Dylan making a Christmas album? Even as a Dylan fan, I was surprised at first, then delighted. This is a really good and heartfelt album.  It has excellent arrangements of Christmas classics, and it has a few tunes that I've never heard before (like The Christmas Blues).  The arrangement of Must Be Santa is rocking and phenonemal, to say the least.  Dylan even adds some hysterical lyrics at the end, and it totally works. On Dylan's last album, Together Through Life, the arrangements were a little loose and relaxed.  Sometimes that worked, other times it didn't. Here, Dylan's band is tight as they have ever been, and it really helps the music immensely. Sure, Dylan's voice is, to quote a song of his, like a \"bullfrog croakin'\", but it doesn't bother me that much.  In fact, on some of the ballads here, his ragged voice works wonders, like on some of the ballads on Modern Times.  The best examples of that are The First Noel, Silver Bells, and Hark the Herald Angels Sing.  I also love the tenderness of Winter Wonderland and The First Noel here, and the charm of Here Comes Santa Claus as well.\n\nThis album has turned out to be one of Dylan's most polarising albums EVER, and I'm really not entirely sure why.  Some of the reactions are downright bizarre at times.  Maybe it's because Dylan is truly sincere here, paying tribute to Christmas songs he heard when he was a child, and that there is no condenscension towards the audience here.  No self conscious smugness.  Just a great record brilliantly performed.  Many people were polarised by Dylan's Christian period as well (which was much underrated in my opinion). Normally, I would recommend this album to Dylan completists, but I recommend it to everyone now. I'm not going to be an idiot contrarian by saying it's Dylan's best album ever (it isn't), but I like it as much as Together Through Life (his other 2009 album), and I have played it quite a lot since I bought it back in November 2009.\n\nChristmas in the Heart is one of Dylan's most memorable albums, like it or not.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"When Jeremih released his smash debut single, \"Birthday Sex\" back in 2009, I thought for sure he'd have a smash album instead he produced one of the worst debuts in recent memory. On his follow up while there is stronger material there's nothing of note that will help him stand out. The CD starts out on decent with All About You where Jeremih, echoes The Dream followed by the equally impressive X & O's. However the third track the 50 Cent assisted Down On Me is just plain trash and a little too vulgar for my tastes. The only other tracks really worth mentioning are the lead single I Like feat. Ludacris, Sleeper,Waiter\/The Five Senses and Love Don't Change. I Like was released this past summer and didn't really get the attention it deserved. With Sleeper and Waiter\/The Five Senses, Jeremih produces a sexy slow jam without going into the corny R. Kelly terriority. The closing track Love Don't Change shows given a chance and the right production, Jeremih can produce some quality R&B music. Love Don't Change may not be a strong ballad as Eric Benet's newest, however like his label mate Sterling Simms, it shows that some of the young cats can produce quality music. Like the recent Trey Songz release, Jeremih would have been smart to release an EP instead of a full album. When you have eleven songs and only six are good, it shows that you just threw some filler on your album. If Jeremih wants to compete with Trey Songz and the revamped Chris Brown he'll need to come a little harder next time.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"George Benson's Breezin' was a landmark album in jazz music.  It introduced a style of jazz that was inflected with r&b stylings that made it appealing to a mass audience who necessarily didn't like the genre.  The album hit number one on the Top 200 & r&b charts and stayed at number one on the jazz charts for over a year.  The album was spurred on by Mr. Benson's smooth and elegant cover of \"This Masquerade\" which peaked at number 10 and went on to win the 1976 Grammy for Record of the Year.  But in addition to that great track, the album had five other gems including the appropriately titled title track which has a light, airy Latin vibe, the straight jazz of \"Six To Four\" and the sophistication of \"Lady\".  The remastered version contains three additional tracks including a great song, \"Shark Bite\" and the single edit of \"This Masquerade\" which palls in comparison to the full length version.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"We do not really think of Simon & Garfunkel as being a folk group, mainly because when \"The Sounds of Silence\" became a big hit and a signature song of the 1960s it had been electrified.  But when you listen to their first album, \"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.,\" it becomes clear from the opening track, \"You Can Tell the World,\" that they were a folk duo.  Of course there is the obligatory Dylan song, \"The Times They Are-A Changin',\" Sixties songs like \"Last Night I had the Strangest Dream,\" and traditional songs like \"Go Tell It On the Mountain\" to add to the folk song bona fides of the album.\n\nIn retrospect what is interesting is Paul Simon's attempt to write folk songs, a category into which \"The Sounds of Silence\" does not fall.  Of those original songs, \"He Was My Brother\" is the one most in keeping with the spirit of the Sixties, while \"Bleecker Street\" evinces the delicate music he could write.  But Simon is still learning his craft, as evidenced by \"Sparrow,\" which tends to be a bit pretentious.  Then there is Simon & Garfunkle's rendition of the traditional song \"Benedictus,\" which gets a bit electrified as well. There is a real sense that the duo are still learning their craft and just beginning to find the sound that would define them.\n\nIn addition to be digitally remastered, this version of \"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. includes a trio of bonus tracks, which consist of bare boned demo version of Simon's \"Bleecker Street\" and alternate takes of his \"He Was My Brother\" and the cover of \"The Sun is Burning.\"  But even with those additions this remains an interesting but not great debut album by a duo that would continue to improve with each and every album they put out until they reached the pinnacle with \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" and then called it quits when they were literally on top of the music world.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"\"Tornado\" is Little Big Town's fifth album, but is the album where the country group has achieved the most success. The album's first single \"Pontoon\" reached #1 on the country charts.  The second single, \"Tornado\", had entered the top 10.  \"Pontoon\" is a catchy little song about having fun of a boat, complete with a double-entendre (\"Mmmm, motorboatin'!).\n\nThere isn't a weak track on the entire album.  The lyrics throughout the album are strong.  That is especially true for \"Tornado\" (the title track).  Like a few other tracks, it is about forlorn love.  Although a country group, there's a lot more to the group than country. They're not a typical `new country act.  There are a lot of classic rock, soul, and gospel elements in their music.  For instance, \"Leavin' In Your Eyes\" sounds like something Fleetwood Mac could have done in the late 70s.  \"Front Porch Thing\" has some gospel harmonies at the beginning. The members of Little Big Town often harmonize their voice together, something uncommon in new country music. Every member of the band is a strong vocalist, and they harmonize very well.  On \"Can't Go Back\", the entire track is harmonizing.\n\n\"Sober\" is an excellent country pop ballad that highlights the lead vocalist's talents. I could see Taylor Swift performing it. \"Self Made\" features heavier guitars than other tracks.  I could see Tim McGraw performing it.\n\nI would recommend this album not only to country fans, but also fans of soulful rock.\n\n(4.25 out of 5 stars)\n\n--Isa R Bufano (February 22, 2013)","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Finally, in early October of 2006, The Killers released their second album: SAM'S TOWN. Fans had been left waiting two years for more material from this pop rock band. The wait was well worth it. This record is just as well put together and performed as the band's debut. SAM'S TOWN opens with an upbeat pop dance tune and the record unfolds from there with the stylish performance of The Killers. The band consists of guitars, bass, drums, keyboards, and numerous sound effects. The vocalist has a very musical part, and its amazing what he accomplishes with the range he has been given. Guitars perform arrpegiated chords, but the inversions of the sanorities trick the ear in hearing fragmented melody lines. The bass and the drums are the main foundation to this group, for they provide the time and roots of harmonies for the keyboards and vocalist to mess around with. The drums parts however are used so cleverly that they almost are a part all their own, but the composer made the instrument play perfectly for each piece. Once again, the keyboards are the most prominate feature to this record and provide harmonies and melodies that back up the vocalist. Progressions are easy on the ear for the most part, but the way the band performs them is what makes each song so unique. The record overall has a great contour and it sets the listener up for a great experience. SAM'S TOWN is a remarkable piece of work, and one to add to The Killers fans' collection as well as any music collection.\n\nStand out tracks include:\n\n\"Sam's Town\"\n\n\"When You Were Young\"\n\n\"For Reasons Unkown\"\n\n\"Read My Mind\"\n\n\"My List\"\n\n\"The River Is Wild\"","classification":4,"fold":6}

Ian Hunter had clearly taken control of the band authoring or co-authoring 8 of the 9 songs. This doesn't diminish Mick  Ralphs contributions--his guitar playing is terrific and his single solo  composition(He wrote three other tracks with Hunter) is a terrific song.\nAlong with Brain Capers, this is the band's finest hour. After this  Ralphs left the band leaving a gaping hole that, perhaps, only Mick Ronson  could have filled if he and Hunter had stayed with the band.

This will re-kindle the passions of many an old fan (like myself).  The songs are overall fall short of the novelty of the first two Keeper albums, but still manage to grasp the key elements of great guitar solos, and an occasional catchy melody\/chorus (IE Ms. God good lyrics, Silent Rain good intro riff), but the flow of the story\/music isn't there for me. It seems very forced.  Times are different, and helloween need to continue to evolve, and not get stuck in a rut like this.  I give it a 4 out of 5 compared to their past few efforts, but if I were a fresh listener, only a 3 at best.  New folks must be introduced to \"I want out-live\" or \"Keepers Live\" first, then The Best, The Rest, The Rare. After savoring those, then dive into Keepers I and II for the complete hook.  Oh, and by the way, there was no need to make two discs out of thes (run time around 78 minutes for both combined).

{"text":"Last night I was reviewing Metacritic's top Cds of 2016. My daughter and I commented upon how few we had listened to and how many we had not even heard of. I went back to the \"top\" LPs of 1968 (a particularly great year) and of the first 100 there wasn't an artist who I didn't recognize. I have the vinyl for about 75% of this 100 and the CD for most of those. The fact is that the volume of music in every genre has exploded to the point where an enormous amount just falls through the cracks. If one is to even contemplate staying current it would involve the devotion of hours a day and would almost certainly necessitate foregoing one's older music library. An anxious person, even while discovering something fabulous that was earlier missed, would always feel that he or she was still missing something great. Undoubtedly is! I prefer to look at it differently. The enormous quantity of quality music being released daily and whizzing by is for me a discovery waiting for me just around the corner. Which brings me to Tame Impala.\n\nA friend Mentioned the band to me so I sought it out, starting with the latest release. I loved it immediately. As I enjoy dreamy base and drum driven synth and as I knew nothing about the artist I was able to listen without prejudice, unaware that the previous CDs were guitar laden and are apparently preferred by many fans. Kevin Porter reminds me of Lewis Taylor, Pet Shop Boys, Brian Wilson, the Beatles and Jonathan Wilson, all artists who enjoyed at some point in their respective careers playing with the production. I now look forward to listening to the first two recordings.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Teddy Thompson and Kelly Jones have teamed up to produce a set that pays homage to the 1950s \"countrypolitan\" songs that married the country influence to a bit more mainstream pop of the era.  Of the two singers, Thompson is the one that I follow with such outstanding CDs as \"Bella,\"; but his 2007 set \"Upfront and Down Low\" most closely resembles this vintage of music.  \"Never Knew You Loved Me Too\" opens with their vocal harmonies tight with frequent Elvis Costello sideman Pete Thomas' drums subtle but sparking the vocals, \"Life is full of little windows that open now and then; so I guess we're left to wonder what might have been.\"  \"Make A Wish On Me\" has punchy percussion and great keyboards with Kelly and Teddy's vocals joyfully having a ball, \"When you've rubbed every lamp in Aladdin's cave...\"  \"Wondering\" stands out with its romantic urgency in the traditional-sounding melody, \"Yes, I'm wondering if you might be wondering too about your touch, about your kisses, about how good it'd feel gettin' close to you.\"  I love the slow heartbreak melody of \"Don't Remind Me\" that makes flash on some of Roy Orbison's great work, \"I try to put these memories behind me, but somehow they always seem to find me.\"  \"Only Fooling\" rests on a mid-tempo melody with a catchy hook, \"You know how much I love you; I can't believe you'd really go.\"  While the set seems short at 25 minutes by today's standards, it fits nicely into the 1950s with most songs under three minutes.  \"Little Windows\" charms the pants off me -- and for a romantically themed album, maybe that's a good thing.

{"text":"This is a very compelling and powerful song about how you can unexpectedly become passionately \"addicted\" to a person (like some type of sexual drug). Obviously, the song is about trying to quit them but how that can be easier said than done. For this song, checking into rehab is more about trying to release someone that has a powerful sexual hold on you. The \"Rehab\" music video features both Rihanna and Justin Timberlake playing a convincing act of lovers who erotically long for each other but who do not really want to let each other go. They have some strong chemistry together in the music video. This song did get some coverage and attention when it first came out, but in my humble opinion it deserved even more exposure and is underrated.

Then came in Mark Kendall's bluesy guitar licks and you got that feeling it was going to up and kick you in the balls and sure neough, it did. The only thing I particularly disliked was how Mark used hammer ons at the end of the song which took away from it's tremendous bluesy feel but that's a musician's point-of-view. *shrugs* Other than that, the CD has some decent material worth listening too as well but this song flat out ROCKS!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Some say Domingo's voice has gotten too old to sing opera anymore so he's crossed over to pop music. I think he is finally sitting back and exploring the music he didn't have time for when he was too busy performing the more than 150 primary opera roles he has sung in his over 45-50 year career. I think he has finally had the opportunity to lift his head up out of Verdi and Puccini and realize there is a wealth of beautiful music out there to explore. He is in marvelous form and  a duets album is a guaranteed success for a crossover production because everyone on it will be selling it. Every Josh Groban fan, Harry Connick Jr.,Kathrine Jenkins, Chris Botti and Susan Boyle fan will buy it for the one song they want to hear from their idol, plus Domingo. I'm an unabashed Groban, Botti,  Boyle and Jenkins fan. I found the most captivating song on this album to be the french song written by Jacques Brel \"La Chanson des vieux Amants\" that Placido sings with French jazz singer ZAZ (aka Isabelle Geffroy). Her voice has that romantic gypsy sound that with his timbre of his tenor takes one away to to a table off cobblestoned streets, a cafe where lovers meet; he pours his heart out to her the Song of Old Lovers:that after twenty years, how can I love another; we've had our fights and stormed off yet everything around us lives and breathes our love. I will always love you; my tender,marvelous love. His French is very good, very clear but then what do I know. I just love this album.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"When Ke$ha was still somewhat new on the scene, I received a lot of flack for supporting an artist whom so many were quick to write off as just another drunken party girl desperate for her 15 minutes. Now, I admit I love my share of mindless pop music anyway, but what made her stand out for me was her incredible knack for writing strong, catchy hooks and incorporating clever, intricate wordplay. And however silly the finished product might be, you never got the feeling that she wasn't in on the joke, unlike so many other popular artists who shall remain nameless. I don't throw around the word genius very often, but as pop music goes, she really is. Needless to say, I was very much looking forward to her new album, Warrior.\n\nTruth be told it's kind of a difficult album to rate, because while she has no doubt matured as a person and as a musical artist (see next paragraph), on the surface a large portion of it just isn't as catchy as I would have expected, and as I said above that's one of the things I can usually count on in a Ke$ha record. When the single Die Young was released to radio, it never really elevated beyond \"just okay\" to me, and still hasn't. The message is good, of course, but it ultimately felt like a half-hearted reworking of We R Who R from her last CD. Unfortunately, I'd say a good half the album is comprised of tracks that left me feeling the same way - not bad necessarily, but nothing you'd likely be caught singing along to, and only just distinctive enough to vaguely remind you of something else she'd done before. Not that there aren't some classic Ke$ha gems to be found here; Thinking of You is a really good \"up yours\" kind of song that would make your grandmother's hair stand on end, and All That Matters is a welcome throwback to 90's dance in the vein of Real McCoy or Ace of Base. Her duet with Iggy Pop, called Dirty Love, puts her in full rocker mode and is actually quite impressive considering it doesn't even break three minutes. Still, even the tracks I do enjoy in the moment have yet to really solidify themselves in my brain the way Tik-Tok or Take it Off did upon first listen a couple years ago.\n\nHowever, if you dig a little deeper and look beyond the obvious lack of Top 40 potential, you might be surprised to find that where the record really shines is in its ballads. \"Introspective\" isn't a word that comes up a lot in relation to Ke$ha, but songs like Wonderland paint a poignant picture of a successful young woman remembering her roots, while Love Into the Light is a forward-looking electro ballad bordering on ethereal. Absolutely phenomenal. Past Lives deserves honorable mention here as well, though my favorite song on the album has to be Last Goodbye; the acoustic structure is not only an unexpected direction for her to take, but really accentuates her vocal range and abilities. Play this one for any of her detractors and you'll have them eating their words, guaranteed.\n\nSo, like I said, taken as a whole Warrior is pretty tricky to form a definitive opinion about. Many of the elements I loved about her earlier releases are downplayed this time around, but at the same time she took so many new risks that paid off and you just can't help but appreciate her as an evolving artist. She wears a lot of hats and dabbles in a lot of styles this time around, but a common theme of self-acceptance and enjoying life runs throughout without ever pandering to or victimizing her audience a la Lady Gaga. (Before anyone goes off, I adore Gaga and her efforts at equality awareness. But it often seems she's bent solely on gaining sympathy for her problems rather than solving them. Just an observation.) In fact, in a weird way, even though I don't love as many individual tracks as I do on her past CDs, Warrior still somehow comes off as the better overall album. I still don't think it's the most mainstream or hook-heavy brand of pop music you'll hear - you really need to LISTEN to it rather than let it play mindlessly in the background at some party - but the way she manages to be fun, silly, bold, gross, witty, thoughtful, meloncholy, sarcastic, and inspirational all at the same time is indeed a feat to behold.","classification":4,"fold":6}

Yet, she hasn't had the best when it has came down to her songs recently.

While Be Without U was very distinctive to a broader audience, and still hits a deep nail on the head, Mr. Wrong didn't really shine from start to finish for me, as much as she could've made it to be.

We just sat mesmerized listening and then the Moog Synthesizer came in and it was WOW.  And all those guitars and guitar licks!  The announcer said it was the Wilson Sisters from Cananda.

Having made the move from SoCal folk-rock band in the late 60's to Nashville-based country band by the early 80's, NGDB never fully lost its roots and is often credited with influencing the modern country-crossover movement.\n\nYou certainly hear those blended influences in \"Fishin' in the Dark\", which marries the toe-tapping twang of mid-80's Nashville country with the vocal harmonies of earlier SoCal folk-rockers like the Mamas and Papas.

{"text":"There are very few MC's from this generation out there that stay true to the art of rap. With artists like Young Thug, Cheif Keef and Bobby Shmurda gaining buzz based off their appearance and antics more so than their actual music, Hip Hop has been on the decline as far as musical quality goes. There have been a few glimmers of hope with the likes of Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole and Big KRIT that have been contributing to the culture in a positive manner, but they come few far in between. However, this young man by the name of \"Logic\" has given this generation of Hip Hop a much needed reminder of how hard work and true appreciation for the art of Hip Hop can make you successful. Equipped with incredible flow and introspective lyricism, Logic part of a rare breed of Hip Hop artists that embodies the culture and helps keep the tradition of good Hip Hop alive.\n\nBack in the 80's and 90's, if you were labeled a rapper in the industry, you actually had to have skill in rapping. Thankfully, Logic is a true MC with great technical skills who can tell palpable stories. This album is one of the best Hip Hop debuts I've heard since Kendrick Lamar's \"good kid, m. A.A.d city\" which came out a full 2 years ago. This album contains everything I want in a Hip Hop album; compelling stories, great production, personality and variety. \"Under Pressure\" has 12 tracks on the standard edition filled with Logic's past experiences and ideologies from telling stories about his brothers selling drugs and streetlife in the stellar \"Gang Related\" to nicotine addiction in \"Nikki\" and his family's past in \"Soul Food\" & \"Growing Pains III\", this album just helps listeners delve into the mind of Logic. The title track \"Under Pressure\" is a 9 minute song that covers everything from his family, his rise as a respectable rapper and skills as an MC.\n\nI've been following Logic ever since he released his first Young Sinatra mixtape back in 2011, so it's pretty incredible to see how far he has came in the past 3 years. He has learned many tricks and has improved vastly as a song-writer. \"Buried Alive\" has great melodies and wonderful production, \"Metropolis\" is a beautiful jazz retrospectful song and \"Bounce\" shows his more braggadocious\/playful side. With that said, while I give this album a 5 star rating there are still small gripes I have. I believe that some of the hooks could've better thought out and less repetitive, while I do appreciate the melodic hooks, there's still work to be done in that department for Logic. With that said, this is a near flawless debut album that fully demonstrates Logic's artistry. Not to mention, he has NO features on this album (excluding the deluxe edition tracks) which is a bold move for any rapper in the industry these days. Please do yourself a favor and check this album out!!!!\n\nFavorite 5\n1) Gang Related\n2) Under Pressure\n3) Buried Alive\n4) Never Enough\n5) Til The End","classification":5,"fold":6}

When listening to the album you keep thinking that the music is building to something, only to have it merge into a different sounding experience.\n\nNote: for those not aware, this album was pieced together using leftover material from The Division Bell sessions, with very little new material actually recorded.\n\nI'm speechless, disappointed, and seriously hoping that I'm not the only person that feels this way after listening to the Pink Floyd album we've been waiting for forever it would seem!","classification":1,"fold":6}

{"text":"In 2008, the world was introduced to Katy Perry.  Her first major-label album, One of the Boys, was nice little album.  Nothing earth-shatter, in my humble opinion, but it had a few fantastic moments.  Its 2010 follow-up, Teenage Dream, was something else entirely.  That was easily one of the greatest pop albums ever released, and a true force to be reckoned with in the world of mainstream music!  Therefore, Prism had a lot to live up to, and its almost not fair to compare it to its older sibling.  With that in mind, let me say that Perry did a fabulous job of making a proper follow-up to that behemoth.  While Teenage Dream was full of sugary pop confections, Prism is much more serious and revealing.  It still has plenty of fun moments though, and when taken in its entirety its a record that will stand firmly among Perrys best work.  Heres a quasi-rundown by track:\n\nROAR  The albums first single, and honestly its the song that least represents the record as a whole.  I always felt that the song wasn't quite finished and takes more than a few shortcuts.  Not the strongest Perry single (despite being #1 on the charts), but its fun enough.  Im glad its the first song on the record, because after it ends the album really opens up.\n\nLEGENDARY LOVERS  Right off, we get into one of the best songs on Prism.  A love song with a Bollywood edge, this is a Katy Perry highlight!  Great production, fantastic vocals, and an awesome breakdown in the middle make for a fantastic song!\n\nBIRTHDAY  For some reason, this reminds me of early Mariah Carey.  The more upbeat stuff she did, to be specific.  A sweet little love song, this is very much Katy Perry.\n\nWALKING ON AIR  One word: GLORIOUS!  Perry was going for a sound reminiscent of early 90s CeCe Peniston and Crystal Watersand to say she succeeded is an understatement!  This song is a 90s deep house love letter, and it wins.  This should be playing at every club at top volume.  It makes me want to jump and dance around my living room!\n\nUNCONDITIONALLY  The albums second single.  Its got some good production, but in my opinion is not the strongest song on the album.  I personally wouldnt have picked this as a single.  The chorus soars, but like Roar I feel it wasn't written too well.\n\nDARK HORSE  This is a hip-hop number that is easily the albums weakest moment.  Its got a repetitive synth backdrop and a grating rap breakdown.  Katy is better than this style of music.\n\nTHIS IS HOW WE DO  I love this song!  Its got a great beat and pays homage to care-free partying, a la Last Friday Night.  My only grip here is that the song is only just over three minutes long.  This would make a fantastic single.\n\nINTERNATIONAL SMILE  Amazing!  Great dance beat and a riveting Daft Punk breakdown in the middle.  Katy shines when she does stuff like this!\n\nGHOST, LOVE ME, THIS MOMENT, DOUBLE RAINBOW  I lump these together because this is the segment of the album that loses me every time.  The four songs aren't bad, and the production is good.theyre just not very memorable at all.  Its unfortunate, because this is the part where Perry starts getting really personal.  Musically, however, they just happen to be blander than the rest of the record.\n\nBY THE GRACE OF GOD  The album closer of the standard edition, this is the albums most personal moment.  Its a beautiful ballad, and one of Prisms strongest tracks.\n\nSPIRITUAL  Along with Walking on Air, this is one of the albums best songs.  Its an ethereal pop track reminiscent of Duran Durans slower material.  This really sounds like nothing else on the record, and its a shame that only the deluxe edition gets this track.  This should be a single.\n\nIT TAKES TWO, CHOOSE YOUR BATTLES  Another two tracks that kind of meld together.  Its tough to follow-up Spiritual, and maybe thats why the deluxe editions closing tracks don't measure up.  Generic lyrics and average production.\n\nWhile not a constant string of heavy-hitting tracks like Teenage Dream, Prism is still a great album.  Really, there was nowhere else for Perrys sound to go.  This really is a great follow up, and in many ways its superior.  If it weren't for those few unmemorable tracks that hold it back.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Jewel Kilcher's recent musical and style change is perhaps the biggest public makeover in years. Once she was a guitar-strumming folk girl. Now she's reinvented herself as the American Kylie Minogue with \"0304,\" a catchy but overpolished collection of dance-pop songs.\nThe more philosophical side of Jewel seems to linger in the slow-paced \"Stand\" (\"It's a shame there's no one to blame\/for all the pain that life brings...\"). But that vanishes with the wispy \"Run 2 U\" and pale \"2 Find U,\" both colorless dance tunes. Some of the necessary verve and power reappears with the catchy \"Intuition,\" bouncy USA-themed song \"America,\" and shimmying \"Yes U Can.\" A more gothic sensibility surfaces in the distorted, ominous \"Haunted.\"\nNobody expects dance-pop to be deep -- all it has to be is catchy. And \"0304\" isn't deep. It's just a collection of mid-level dance music, with mediocre lyrics, acceptable vocals and packaged electronic pop music. We've seen it all before, but Jewel's offering isn't bad. Instead, it just fails to be really good.\nWhen you hear Jewel's voice, you can tell that all the flaws have been scrupulously polished out. In past albums, her voice had minor imperfections. No more. It's not an exceptional voice, but neither is it bad; it's suited for the dance music she produces here, which isn' too taxing.  Musically, it can't be denied that \"0304\" is very catchy. Jewel flavors the dance-pop with hints of jazz (the accordion in \"Intuition\") and replaces her acoustic guitars with electric and bass. Okay, the acoustic guitars are still there, but good luck finding them.\nUnfortunately the songs are essentially empty. Jewel has a good ear for rhythm and rhyme, but there's nothing really interesting about these songs. They're just ordinary dance-pop. (\"If u want my love\/u can try my love\/u can't buy my love\/just take my hand\") The only exceptions to this are \"Stand\" and the sinister, stalker theme song \"Haunted.\" Ironically, these two are the best of this album.\n\"0304\" may prove to be a mixed blessing for Jewel. It's catchy and danceable but essentially empty. Only time will tell if the folkie-turned-popster's new sound will take.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"First let me say, based on what I've read the record companies have waived their usual fees so ALL of the money from sales goes directly to the Japan Red Cross. If that's so, bravo to them. Currently the mp3 and CD goes for around ten dollars. That may not seem like much to donate to such a needed cause, but when many thousands of people do it...$$$.\n\nNow for the music, other than the Lady Gaga track it looks to me like everything here is available elsewhere. Some songs are old, some songs are newer, but almost nothing is exclusive to this collection (usually a reason to buy). Also fyi, a number of the songs are the live versions: RHCP, Madonna, Josh Groban, REM, Sting. Songs from Eminem and Nicki Minaj are the clean versions. One big plus is that Songs For Japan is two discs worth of music, so we get 38 songs! 19 on each disc, which is about as full as a CD can be. (Currently the CD edition isn't showing the Madonna or David Guetta tracks).\n\nThere's no doubt few people want every song here, but at 38 cents a track you can't beat it. It's like getting 28 songs for free. Normally I'd never give most of these songs 5 stars, but for the quantity, the quality and the cause....5 stars.

{"text":"An audio and video document of the quintet's 2011 tour, The Mothership Returns is a return to form for Return to Forever.  Long-time alums Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, and Lenny White join forces with guitarist Frank Gambale and violinist Jean-Luc Ponty on revisits of their prog-jazz past.  Some tracks trace to a note their original studio version's twisting, stop-on-a-dime arrangements -- this band is tight!  Others explore and stretch, as the musicians challenge and prod each other to new ground - this band fears nothing!  Around White's and Clarke's precision rhythm base, Corea paints piano and synth splashes, Ponty's violin soars in lyrical flights, and Gambale shreds guitar lines that make Carlos Santana sound like a Mel Bay student.  The sound is round, well-produced, and clean.  And there are no best parts, `cause they're all on.  Don't miss the Escher-like turns of \"Medieval Overture,\" the laid-back funk of \"Sorceress,\" and Corea's instrumental duel with the audience in \"Spain.\"  The mothership has returned and offers a trip like no other.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"What I love about this band is how real their music is. Hard rock is so much more popular now than it ever use to be, so there's lots of wannabe bands showing up, trying to be the next big thing. And they end up just sounding like some sort of boy-band version of hard rock. But Avenged Sevenfold is the real deal. They make songs that people will listen to years from now. They're not just one hit wonders trying to get a single song to make the charts. They have real talent, and Hail to the King is a great example of it. This song tells a great story, and it very different from other rock songs out there. Avenged Sevenfold knows how to do this, just like so many of the all time best hard rock bands do. They're taking their place in the ranks with groups like Nine Inch Nails, Metallica, Disturbed, Alice in Chains, Godsmack and all the other bands that make killer music music that's genuine, not wannabe.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Glad All Over will stop you dead in your tracks, so don't go thinking you're gonna hear more of the memories that reside on the jukebox as a whispering of what you're about to discover here.  Glad All Over, the first release from the band in seven years, following the two solo albums by Jacob Dylan that sailed quietly under the radar, presents The Wallflowers rebooted, kicked into high gear, full of colourful imagery, and strung out on verbal and guitar hooks that splash across the screen with the raw urgency of \"Rock The Casaba,\" and features Mick Jones on two tracks.\n\nGlad All Over hits like this is the very first time you're hearing the band, coming at you with a power that nearly erases their past low keyed outings as little more than Blonde On Blonde meandering nods ... finally coming to grips with their own talent, one that's filled with a huge sharp engulfing sound more suitable for the big stage, and not the small clubs.  Now ... there are going to be many who don't understand why a band some twenty years into their career would adopt a neo-punk attitude, and craft songs that stand in complete juxtaposition to the etherial atmospheric visions that both defined and graced their first releases.  Considering those aspects, this is not a comfortable album, but one that certainly reflects the times and world situation, and it's all by choice and design, making this just one more pocket for the boys to draw from, even if it is a bit out of their and our comfort zone.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"You may remember Crossfade, as coming out from nowhere with their big hit single in 2004 with \"Cold.\" Since that song faded out on the airwaves, it's been a pretty low-profile for the band. Well, here we are in 2006, the band has ditched their turntablist\/backing vocalist and have emerged with a new album, \"Falling Away\" that promises more and more radio-play, with each and every song seemingly tailor-made for mainstream rock stations.\n\nDoes anything live up to the catchiness and effect of their one big hit? Well, like their debut, the answer is pretty much \"no.\" There are a few songs that show true growth and improvement, such as \"Breathing Slowly\" \"Never Coming Home\" and \"Washing The World Away.\" Songs like \"Invincible\" and \"Someday,\" however, come across as feeble attempts to recapture that magic. For those who dug the rap-rock vibes of the first CD, you'll be disappointed to find that element is missing (thanks to a missing member, I presume). Personally, I think they're the better for it, but if \"Death Trend Setta\" was your thing, you'll probably hate this album.\n\nI'm not gonna say this album is all bad. The three tracks I mentioned are definitely worth looking into this album for, and catchy rock-filler like \"Anchor\" and \"Falling Away\" help make it a more appealing listen. It's a better album than the first one, but still a far cry from greatness. The sad fact is that Crossfade's sound is nothing overly original or inspiring. Just simple modern-rock for the masses -- not that there's anything wrong with that...","classification":3,"fold":6}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites","classification":5,"fold":6}
{"text":"The Black Angels' debut \"Passover\" was an exciting surge back to 60s psychedelia, full of mind-bending drones, trippy guitars and a truly inspired vocalist in Alex Maas. \"Direction To See A Ghost\" continues things in the same vein. Granted there isn't much new to TBA's sound, but this doesn't bother me. They have such a distinguished sound already that varying it too much after just two releases was never necessary.\n\nAs with the debut, the songs tend to flow and groove endlessly. The `drone machine' saturates everything, the drums are powerful and locked, the guitar tone is perfectly fuzzy and Maas' piercing, nasally delivery is wonderfully fitting. Some songs have the tendency to drift on, but there are some real gems here. The one-two punch of \"You On The Run\" and \"Doves\" is a grand opening, with the former setting up a brooding, melancholy Velvet Underground atmosphere, only for the latter to cut through with some feel-good, sunshine pop psychedelia. Other highlights include the sombre \"18 Years\" and the sitar-laden \"Deer-Ree-Shee\". Generally, there isn't a bad song to be found here. \"Directions\" is another great album from The Black Angels that firmly cements them at the forefront of modern psychedelic rock.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Zac Brown & his band are definitely innovators in Modern American Music. They are definitely the best band to come out of the \"South\" in many years. To me, they seem like a \"Modern Day\" Allman Brothers Band (ABB). \"Uncaged\" is definitely \"Music Without Boundaries\". They've already won a grammy award for the Best New Artist, from a few years back. I love everything they've released, and I really love this new album.\n\nLike other reviewers have pointed out, these songs reflect several different genres & styles, but the one thing that is consistent, is that all the songs are fantastic. I like the picture of \"Southern Ground\" (Zac Brown's Band \"ZBB\"), on the back of the CD package, it has the band members appearing in a \"historical style\" setting. The \"Island Song\" is \"Jimmy Buffet & Bob Marley Raggae flavored\". \"Overnight\" is \"Jazz flavored\" & includes Louisiana's own Trombone Shorty, who toured with the ZBB this year (2012). \"The Day I Die\" is kinda blues flavored & includes Amos Lee. Other songs are Country flavored & some are Southern Rock flavored. This album simply contains a mix of fantastic music from the very beginning to the very end.\n\nOverall, this is definitely a 5 star Zac Brown Band Album, and I highly recommend it. Thanks and I hope this review has been helpful.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library.  With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing.  It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.  Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was fairly cheap on Amazon....69 cents, I think?  But most of the songs I download are free..  Thats right!  Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too.  In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.  Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great!  At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free\n\nFREE ALBUMS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Albums by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":6}

The truth is that after the fact, the whole album makes you think twice as to her original purpose with \"Intuition\", the song\/video that has stigmatized her so much.\nBut yes! As a whole, it's not tough to see that most of the songs are geared toward a more teenage audience, rather than the one that grew through College listening to her earlier work, but there's a few songs for those of us that are in the latter category, such as the very Alanis-like \"Haunted\" (in fact, it's such an appropriate song to play out loud on a Halloween night like tonight) and the clever \"America\". Falling somewhere in between the preferences of the two groups lies the closing track, \"Becoming\" which I particularly loved.\nAll in all, this is an album mostly geared to a teenage audience with a little \"classic\" Jewel to offer for her longtime followers.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"A bit late to the party here, but I figure I might as well leave a review anyhow.\n\nI normally don't listen to a lot of modern, popular music -- I have my favorites and am content to listen to them, and most modern music doesn't appeal to me.  I'll stick with my movie soundtracks and '80s classics, thank you.  XD  But after seeing the music video for \"Roar\" and really listening to the lyrics, I grew attached to this song.  I'm not a huge fan of most of Katy Perry's music, but there was something empowering about \"Roar\" and its message, and the music video was fun to watch.  And that was worth stepping out of my comfort zone to listen to.\n\nThe song itself is fun and catchy, with a lively beat and instrumentals, but stylistically it's not much different from a lot of modern pop music.  And Katy Perry's voice is passable but not excellent -- many singers seem to be more popular for their looks than for their pipes anymore.  Still, a song about standing up for yourself and finding your own inner strength instead of relying on someone else's is something to celebrate.  And in a day when so much media chooses to focus on trivial things like sex, partying, etc., it's nice to have a song with a strong message instead of a generic subject matter.\n\nKaty Perry's heyday may be on its way out, but I hope \"Roar\" is a song she's remembered for.  It's a proud pop anthem that may not be the greatest song ever, but is catchy and well worth getting stuck in your head.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"It's no secret that Michael Jackson was incredibly talented and gifted musician, the fact that he also had a passion for his art must have helped. This two discs collection covering the man's entire career from the time he was a little kid up to his later years as one of the most famous person on this planet. It serves as an example of how great his music was and how it's still amazing today. Few artists have had the impact that MJ had on the music industry, Michael revolutionized it, and in the 1980's Michael was fashion. MJ's certainly has an interesting musical career and The Essential Michael Jackson is all the proof you need, we could go into how Thriller is the best selling album of all time, or how History is the best selling double disc album of all time, or how Blood On The Dance Floor is the best selling remix album... However the point here is not to demonstrate Michael's numerous accomplishments in the music industry, it's how good his music was.\n\nThe first 8 songs of this greatest hits album are from Michael's time in the Jackson 5\/ Jacksons. Then we get 4 songs from Off The Wall (1979), 7 songs from Thriller (1982), 8 from Bad (1987), 7 from Dangerous (1992) and 1 from both History (1995) and Invincible (2001). All the hits you would expect are here: Don't Stop `Till You Get Enough, Billie Jean, Thriller, Bad and much more. There isn't much to say about the songs included, they're all great in their own way and deserving to be on this \"essential\" collection. Besides the \"Ultimate Collection\" boxed set, this compilation is by far the most comprehensive look at Michael's career. It covers not only his solo career but his early years as a child with the Jackson 5\/ Jacksons which is a nice feature of this compilation disc, Michael Jackson compilations tend to be focused only on his solo career.\n\nI can't hide the fact that I'm a little disappointed that there is only one song from both History and Invincible. Those latter years album were not huge hits for Michael (although History sold very well and went on to become the most successful double disc album of all time) but I still like them both and thought more songs from these albums could\/should have been included. \"They Don't Care About Us\" and \"Earth Song\" are excellent songs from History that would have been excellent to have on a career-spawning collection. From Invincible I think \"Whatever Happens\" should have been here and perhaps \"Butterflies\". It's easy to understand why almost nothing from these albums was included, they do not really match the pop \"hits\" in terms of lyrics or musicality, they are much more personal and less accessible than material from Thriller or Bad for instance. That aside, The Essential Michael Jackson gives buyers what they really want, the hits and more well-known songs. I must add it does a good job at doing so!\n\nThe Essential Michael Jackson does an excellent job of going further than your average compilation and offers Michael's hits and some of his best songs. The fact that it covers his entire career is great; you get a proper overview of Jackson's music. For someone who is relatively new to Michael Jackson's music this is really The Essential Michael Jackson.  4  \/5.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Rap, Rock, Alternative, Praise. Gospel you name it.\n\nI dare you for one week, listen ONLY to Christian Radio and Music.\n\nThen go back and \"try\" to listen to secular radio and music.

{"text":"Lianne La Havas Is Your Love Big Enough is the one that got away in 2012.  La Havas didn't glide totally under the American radar. The Brit appeared on Carson Dalys show and she got a mention on NPR.\n\nI actually learned about Is Your Love Big Enough while looking at the best of 2012 list compiled by an on-line magazine that I respect  Pop Matters. Ive been going there and comparing their list to ours for the last three years, and usually theres a lot of overlap. That was also the case in 2012.\n\nIs Your Love Big Enough landed at number two on Pop Matters best R&B list. That piqued my curiosity and I was able to land a copy. However, I didn't listen right away. I finally got around to it about two weeks ago, and Ive hardly listened to anything else.\n\nIn many ways LaHavas is a fusion of the many of the female singers from Great Britain who have achieved varying levels of success in America over the last five years. Acoustic tunes such as Tease Me, Age  a witty tune in which the 23-year old singer\/songwriter tells a tale of falling for a much older man  and the duet No Room For Doubt place La Havas in that folk and R&B fusion occupied by singer\/songwriters such as the tragically overlooked Rachael Bell.\n\nTracks such as the sparse and melancholy Gone allow LaHavas to display vocal range. La Havas sings accompanied by a piano, an arrangement that gives the artist free range to showcase her powerful and soulful vocal instrument, and might remind listeners of power ballads rendered by Adele on her instant classic 21.\n\nLa Havas occupies her own space on the percussive Forget, a tune the singer wrote after a break-up. The track is a high-energy amalgamation of funk and rock in which La Havas showcases her deft fingering on her constantly present guitar. Her vocals  especially the hook where she yells fooorgeeet\/all the words the let you break my heart combine the assertiveness of rock with one the one bounce of funk.\n\nLa Havas is a powerful and unique voice, and its a mystery to me why she hasn't attained the breakout success in America of Adele, Amy Winehouse, Corinne Bailey Rae or Joss Stone. Is Your Love Big Enough attests to the fact that La Havas artistic range and talent is large enough to operate in the territory occupied by all of those performers while also managing to sound distinctive.","classification":5,"fold":6}

It's the same sound you hear when a cassette tape gets caught up in the rollers. After you untangle the tape and fix it right on the reel, it's still playable but there's one section that got mangled and doesn't quite sound right.

{"text":"Firefall \"is a rock band that formed in Boulder, Colorado in 1974. It was founded by Rick Roberts, who had been in the Flying Burrito Brothers, and Jock Bartley, who had been Tommy Bolin's replacement in Zephyr. The band's biggest hit single, `You Are the Woman,' peaked at number 9 on the Billboard charts in 1976. Other hits include `Just Remember I Love You' (# 11 in 1977), `Strange Way' (# 11 in 1978), `Cinderella' (# 34 in 1977) and `Staying with It' (# 37 in 1981) with female vocalist Lisa Nemzo.\" (Wikipedia).\n\nThese five tracks are some of Firefall's best music. \"You Are the Woman\" has a sweet melody and Firefall does this really well--it's a classic that got lots of airplay when it was originally released! \"You Are the Woman\" still sounds good today. \"Just Remember I Love You\" also was a big hit for the band; just one listen will tell you why! The guitar is well used in the musical arrangement and this couldn't have been done any better. \"Strange Way\" features Firefall singing and playing at their usual very best; and \"So Long\" is an excellent tune. The track set ends with Firefall performing \"Livin' Ain't Livin';\" it leaves me wanting more from this awesome group!\n\nFirefall biggest fans will probably have most if not all of this great music already, so I think this music is best for the more casual fan or newcomers just discovering Firefall's incredible artistry.

{"text":"Watching BET's Midnight Love one night, I was introduced to a r&b singer named Jaheim.  As I was watching his video, I wasn't too impressed with \"Could It Be\" at first.  I saw the song as just another new cat jumping into the r&b game.  However, as I heard the song more often, I began to like the song more and Jaheim's voice wasn't that bad, as it reminded me of the infamous Teddy P singing \"Love TKO\", \"Turn Off The Lights\", or \"Come Go With Me\".  I was still hesitant in buying \"Ghetto Love\" but everyone that had purchased the CD gave me rave reviews so I decided to purchase my own copy.  \"Ghetto Love\" turned out to be one of my favorite r&b CDs of 2001.  I liked how Jaheim used his sharp \"street\" edge to his songs.  My favorites included \"Looking For Love\", \"Ghetto Love\", \"Remarkable\" w\/Terry Dexter, \"Ready, Willing & Able\", as well as the rest of his singles:  \"Just In Case\" and \"Anything\" w\/Next.  With a title of \"Still Ghetto\" you would expect the same thing from his sophomore CD and ladies and gentlemen that is what you will get.  \"Still Ghetto\" starts off with Jaheim and Duganz doing what they did on a few tracks on \"Ghetto Love\" by rappin' and singin' straight from the streets.  From there, Jaheim does what he does best by lacing his fans with the street anthems and romantic melodies that he is known for now.  His 1st single, \"Fabolous\" is dedicated to the children coming up in the world today.  As Jaheim can tell you, he knows how rough it was growing up and being a hardhead so he is trying to motivate children of today to not walk in the same path that he did.  While the song may not hit you like \"Could It Be\", \"Fabolous\" gets a strong point across and was definintely the right pick for the 1st single.  The majority of the rest of the songs deal with relationships and trying to find the right woman.  The ladies will definitely be impressed with this CD.  \"Diamond In Da Ruff\" deals with a woman that Jaheim wish he would have treated better and now he realizes how much they could have had if he would have swallowed his pride and been a man about their relationship.  \"Let's Talk About It\" follows the same line as Jaheim wants to talk to someone that he dealt with in the past and try to realize where they went wrong.  He was in trouble so much that he couldn't be focused in the relationship.  \"Put That Woman First\" covers territory that has been covered by R Kelly, \"When A Woman's Fed Up\" and Joe, \"Treat Her Like A Lady\".  However, with the old school feel to the song, this will still be one of your favorites.  \"Beauty & Thug\" features the queen of r&b\/hip hop, Mary J Blige and brings pleasant results.  Both singers sound very well together and Malik Pendleton, who produced Mary J. Blige's \"Seven Days\" from her \"Share My World\" CD does the production.  The fellas will be able to relate to \"Tight Jeans\", as Jaheim tells a tale about one of his good female friends always coming around him wearing tight jeans.  While he may have intentions of being a platonic friend, she is tempting him to think of her in other ways.  Jaheim also displays the same sentimental side that he showed on \"Ghetto Love\" with songs like \"Backtight\", \"Special Day\", \"Long As I Live\" and \"Everywhere I Am\".  The latter, is a powerful dedication to his mom who passed away when he was a teenager . On another song, \"Me And My B****\", Jaheim professes his loyalty for his lady, but at the same time he is saying if you try to \"get at her\", that might be the last move you make.  This may be too much for some r&b fans, but if you understand the concept, you will understand that he isn't trying to offend women, this is just his way of expressing his thoughts on this particular song.  If Jaheim would have ended \"Still Ghetto\" at track 13, I believe that he would have a 5 star CD on his hands.  However, tracks 14-16, turn out to be nothing but filler.  Especially, \"Whut You Want\", which puts a damper on 13 straight tight songs.  The majority of the production is handled by Kay Gee, formerly of Naughty By Nature and Eddie F and Darren Lighty, which provides primarily the same sound as his debut CD displayed.  Overall, Jaheim has a nice sophomore CD on his hands.  If you liked \"Ghetto Love\", you will enjoy \"Still Ghetto\" but you may enjoy the 1st CD better.\nJames' Top 5\n1) Long As I Live\n2) Diamond In Da Ruff\n3) Beauty & Thug w\/Mary J Blige\n4) Me & My B****\n5) Put That Woman First","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Honestly, it is very tough whenever someone young and talented, dies at a young age, and in a heartbroken stage in their life. Sadly, it has been 20 years since the deviating suicide of Michael Hutchence of INXS, and his death is still just as sad and unparalleled for anyone whop is a hard core fan of the 80's Australian rock band. Yet, INXS did try and comeback hard in 2005, with a new lead singer, J.D. Fortune, and he took the group back to the heights they used to have for a brief shining moment with their 2005 album, Switch. Their lead single, Pretty Vegas from the Switch album is one of those songs that tries to bring in the hearty hard core pieces from some of INXS's past songs like Devil Inside from their Kick record. The song is alright, but not anything that tries to be more striking to bring in new fans of INXS. It is just so sad that INXS isn't together anymore, but they did leave a amazing imprint in Australian rock music that has still has not been matched from the land down under. Maybe the next Michael or J.D. will come around the corner and try and be more than fiercely pretty.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":6}

But for Kelly Clarkson, she honestly hasn't been able to make music sound all her own so well. That actually is proof of her latest single, Already Gone, the 3rd single from her latest album All I Ever Wanted isn't really a song that feels like it is original. Actually, if you honestly get a closer listen to the song, it actually sounds a bit too similar in its melody like Beyonce's recent song Halo. I really am not that fully impressed with Kelly's latest, not only that, but it also is a bit dissapointing. It doesn't bring out the heart on other recent songs, like Whitney Houston's elequent I Look To You.

{"text":"At this point you can't pretend that you bought a Roger Waters' album without knowing what to expect. You know he's going to critically examine war, politics, politicians, policies, and societal ills. This is something he has been doing in earnest since 1973's \"Dark Side of the Moon\". Same goes for making 'concept' albums, which \"Is This the Life We Really Want?\" (ITTLWRW) clearly is.\n\nSo, does 73 year old Waters have something fresh and new to say? No, but he is one of only a handful of musicians willing to continually comment on the current state of affairs, and for that, he immediately earns two stars. The trouble with Waters solo work is that it has lacked the musicianship from the rest of the Pink Floyd camp. Someone once said that Roger Waters was Pink Floyd's conscience, it's vision, it's lyrical poetry, whilst Gilmour, Wright and Mason were the architects, sound designers, and heart behind Waters' words. Nowhere is that more apparent that on ITTLWRW--the lyrics are spot on, but musically....well....the album is just so-so. Musically, there are no inspired moments, no innovative curves, no surprises sonically. So, after several listens, the music isn't all that memorable while what Waters is talking about resonates long after the music ends.\n\nI'm not entirely certain as to why Waters felt the need after 25 years of silence to comment once more on current affairs. He pretty much addressed everything that needed addressing with 1992's \"Amused to Death\", or 1979's \"The Wall\" or 1977's \"Animals\". I want to be extremely clear here--I side with Waters' point of view, but that point of view isn't as effectively showcased with the music presented on ITTLWRW. I don't mind at all that Waters is a realist, a cynic, a pessimist, or what you will. I side with that view. He just should have brought the music to go with it this time, and he didn't. For that, I can't give this work five stars, or even four stars. It falls somewhere between three and three and a half stars for me.\n\nThat being said, I have to say that the final trilogy of songs here are some of Waters' most moving of his career--\"Wait for Her\", \"Oceans Apart\", and \"A Part of Me Died\". Those, along with \"Broken Bones\" are my favorites here. They just aren't enough to push this album above three stars.\n\nThis very well could be the first and last time I write a critique on Roger Waters and\/or Pink Floyd as it seems there may be nothing that follows in the future. I am not a big David Gilmour solo work fan, and so I will take this final opportunity to compare this current work with Roger Waters' and Pink Floyd's previous works.\n\nPink Floyd:\n\n1967 The Piper at the Gates of Dawn: Four Stars\n1968 A Saucerful of Secrets: Three and a Half Stars\n1969 More: Three Stars\n1969 Ummagumma: Two and a Half Stars\n1970 Atom Heart Mother: Three Stars\n1971 Meddle: Four Stars\n1972 Obscured by Clouds: Three and a Half Stars\n1973 Dark Side of the Moon: Five Stars\n1975 Wish You Were Here: Five Stars\n1977 Animals: Four Stars\n1979 The Wall: Five Stars\n1983 The Final Cut: Four Stars\n1987 A Momentary Lapse of Reason: Three Stars\n1994 The Division Bell: Three and a Half Stars\n2014 The Endless River: Two and a Half Stars\n\nRoger Waters:\n\n1984 The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking: Three and a Half Stars\n1987 Radio K.A.O.S.: Three Stars\n1992 Amused to Death: Four Stars\n2017 Is This the Life We Really Want?: Three Stars","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"As we approach the thirtieth anniversary of Madonna's warmly quixotic song and video, \"La Isla Bonita,\" we are reminded of a time when undocumented Latinos in America were being granted amnesty and Latino culture was on the rise, in large measure due to people like Gloria Estefan and her Miami Sound Machine Band.  So in a very real sense, not much has changed in the intervening thirty years.  We do have more Latino Governors and Congressional Latinos as well as the first Latina on the Supreme Court, but we are still grappling with the everyday problems of immigration, civil rights, and the wars on drugs and poverty.  Madonna's smash hit from the summer of 1986, \"La Isla Bonita,\" was both the heir apparent to a view of Latino America that harkened back to the West Side Story of the 1950s or even the \"Feliz Navidad\" of the 1970s while rejecting the more negative stereotypes of a guns-a-blazing Speedy Gonzalez or an overtly sexual Don Juan.  Her song and message infused the American pop landscape with images of warm ocean breezes and the young love between a boy and a girl.\n\nCatching its wind from the sexual reformation and women's liberation of the 1960s, the gist of the song and video is a young girl's desire and fantasy for intimacy and escape from the confines of her apartment in a Latino neighborhood, symbolizing sexual freedom within the confines of proper society.  While the song emphasized the lyrical melody of soft Latino folk and guitar music to a calypso beat, the accompanying video incorporated elements of the family, the Church, and everyday street life in the barrios.  While the song was a longing by Madonna to be near the tropical and warm, her video was a senorita's longing for her new love, a street guitarist named San Pedro. The charm of the song and the video was in their simplicity and innocence and how it captured a Latino's perspective on life in general.  With young and old alike dancing in the streets, a Madonna in full Spanish regalia bounds from her apartment to join the muchachos in their celebration of love, life, and unity of purpose as the lyrics expressively sing of all nature wild and free and a paradisiacal Spanish lullaby.  Madonna is both a woman in control, as she flirts with each of the street dancers, and strangely vulnerable as she swaggers from the scene.\n\nIf America is marching towards a future a bit more European and a bit more bi-lingual or even multi-lingual, then \"La Isla Bonita\" will continue to serve as an example of all that is good and pure and playful in a culture which either thrust itself or was thrust upon by natural forces the American scene.  While locally we have experienced everything from the brutal murder of an illegal immigrant named Luis Ramirez to Latino life and culture being displayed daily by newspaper, radio, and television, Madonna's unabashedly, even foolishly, romantic portrayal and expression of Latino life stands as a charming reminder of what America really is, and that is a melting pot of humanistic ideals that are common to all people.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Dream Theater goes  well, theatrical. So having read the hype up to this release I have to say that this is not exactly what I was expecting. With cultures current obsession with dystopian futuristic machine vs. man science fiction movies\/books\/themes going on it is no surprise to find one of the most prolific and adventurous progressive bands of our era delving into similar subject material. But, while themes of oppression, governmental control, revolution and war were expected, I never expected this to be a modern day version of Romeo & Juliet  sort of. In reality, it is all of those things and much more. This 2 hour concept double CD (4LP) production plays out like a play  truly an epic story of love, betrayal and redemption this was clearly written with the intent to take on the road as a big rock opera\/theatrical production. Lyrically conceived and written by Petrucci, the story takes place some 200 years in the future where the reigning powers have allowed the NOMACS to suppress musical expression in favor of electronic noise (sound familiar?) In a manner similar to Rushs 2112, The Chosen One rises from the oppressed with the offer of the gift of music to humanity  the music to serve as the vehicle to spur revolution and the restoration of humanity. Yeah, its much more complicated than that but no spoilers here. The fun of an album like this is to be able to explore the characters, scenes and backdrop for oneself - far be it from me to spoil anybodys virgin listening experience.\n\nMusically, this is truly different from where the band has gone before. Sure, theyve done the epic story telling tracks before (The Count of Tuscany just one example), but those songs really could stand alone. The Astonishing is an entire theatrical performance (akin to Pink Floyds The Wall) and plays out exactly in that fashion, each song dependent on the preceding track for support and context both lyrically and musically. Sound effects are used to create a cinematic vibe and there are some choral and symphonic elements but they never seem to overwhelm what the band is trying to accomplish. Its cool how the narration of the story is actually worked into the body of the songs so we don't get corny spoken parts interrupting the flow of music. The way they reference themselves in When Your Time Comes is brilliant. And in general, the genius with much of the diversity here is that if you take the work as a whole it actually pays tribute to many different forms of music (rock, jazz, classical, etc.) and in doing so specifically supports the legacy of Dream Theater and in general all forms of musical expression.\n\nSo what about the music that supports this epic story? Well, there are a few things that really surprised me. With the exception of the overture type songs that we hear at the beginning of Act I and Act II (not new to Dream Theater), it has been a long time since I heard these guys emphasize the melody and really serve the song in this regard. Some of these songs are a bit mellow (especially Act I), so don't expect huge technical riffing and endless soloing. That is definitely de-emphasized here to the point that I almost didn't believe what I was hearing at first (only because it was such a departure for DT), but with repeated listens these melodies are strikingly beautiful. Even Mangini takes a back seat to the song  his normally mathematical machinations supplanted by supporting rhythms injected with the occasional flamboyancies. Interestingly, much of this music reminds me of the Images and Words\/Awake era in that regard, as well as Scenes From A Memory. The piano plays a huge role, especially in Act I. More surprising though is that LaBrie handles the vocals of (in addition to the narrator) ALL EIGHT of the key characters! Those familiar with Ayreon  Arjen Lucassen is the master of 2 CD concept releases  will recall his thing was to give each character in his stories a different voice in the form of an individual singer. Folks, James LaBrie does all of the voices here, which is extremely challenging. And while I would have loved to have heard some guest vocalists on a release like this, LaBrie makes it work. He is truly brilliant on this record. Look, Ive been a sceptic of his voice in the past, at times when his voice was less than stellar. But his performance here is THE focal point of The Astonishing  and to me that is astonishing in and of itself since the history of this band has always been that the vocals kind of take a back seat to the instrumental wizardry. Not so here. Although I will say that while Act I feels a bit more melody driven, Act II brings some of the heaviness, instrumental wizardry and soloing that fans will want. My final surprise with this release musically is that the NOMACS don't play a bigger role here. Their \"music\" only occupies 5 short tracks on the entire 2CD set. I really thought there might be more warring between traditional music and robotic music, but as it turns out the NOMACS are a very small part of the story here as this is really a story about humanity vs. humanity  the machines are controlled by the behavior of the humans, and the ultimate outcome dictated by human actions.\n\nSo where are the negatives? Well, more vocalists would have been more fun in my opinion but I applaud LaBries performance here  his best in nearly 2 decades. I don't like the long lag between tracks which makes no sense if this is actually to play out like a musical. The digipak presentation is very average, the insert booklet (which is bound to the inside of the digipak) very hard to read. And while I realize the deluxe packages and vinyl packages will provide more in the area of presentation I still cant help but think the label could have done a better job with a release of this magnitude. And so the deluxe editions (ridiculously delayed due to manufacturing issues until later this spring despite the money grab) should shine in this regard and provide even more depth into the story, but Ive yet to hear about any kind of 5.1 formats. I suspect that will come with a BD\/DVD live presentation most likely after the tour has concluded. For me, I cant wait to hear the vinyl version. Although it was well advertised ahead of time that the deluxe box version was not going to be available until March, I was disappointed that the vinyl box set has been delayed since as it was originally slated for release today.\n\nIn summary, The Astonishing is a different beast, one that might frighten some fans away while simultaneously entice others to explore. But one thing is for sure  this is Dream Theater through and through, and I for one am really glad to see them not only revisit their more melodic roots but also bring something this inspiring, positive and this hugely theatrical to the stage.\n\n3\/17\/16 - The vinyl version consists of 4 LPs housed in an impressive thick cardboard case containing Act I and Act II - each act a double gatefold 2LP  the impressive fold-out map one side\/poster on other, and the FLAC download card. The 180gm black LPs (mine nice and flat) are contained within non anti-static, printed sleeves (a character on each side) and the lyrics themselves are printed on the inside of the gate-folds. I have to say, for the most part the packaging is primo but I do not understand why the lyrics are printed in the same small white font as the CD version and they don't fill the entire inner double gate-fold, so it looks awkward and its hard to read the lyrics. This is quite disappointing, to say the least. The artwork on the outside of the box does stand out, though, so thats a plus.\n\nSo how does this version sound? Well, with the criticisms about the overly compressed CD version being mostly valid, some fans will be glad to know that the vinyl version does really impart to these songs a more open and vibrant quality, although the difference between the CD and vinyl is not quite as noticeable on this release as that on, say the new Iron Maiden album where the vinyl sounds worlds better than the CD. The bass end does gain traction on the vinyl, but it still seems a bit suppressed (bass drum and guitar that is). What really stands out here are the vocals and some of the nuances in the music (like crowd and background noises) that really jump out of the speakers on the vinyl and really were background in the CD mix. And, the vinyl master sounds really great at high volumes (no distortion) and its here that the bass lines start to assert their power. Overall, I prefer this version, and Im not an audiophile snob as I realize that digital to analog has its pitfalls. In general, I still prefer D to A vinyl to overly compressed CD\/mp3 quality most of the time (unless its HD 96\/24 digital). Still, until we hear the live performances (which steal the show sound-wise from what Ive read in reviews so far) I think it is fair to say that the vinyl version, which sounds more dynamic and less compressed than the mp3\/CD versions, does this composition more justice but still seems a bit lacking in the low frequency punch. Rotating 4 LPs through 8 sides is a lot of work for some so I think this will mostly appeal to those truly looking for the total listening experience to The Astonishing. To me the vinyl experience is a step up from the CD\/mp3 version (these are clear\/crisp sounding records), but for some the cost may be too steep to justify.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"New Day Rising is proof that a band can follow-up an incredibly brilliant album, in this case Zen Arcade, with an even better album. New Day Rising is sort of like Zen Arcade meets their later, but still brilliant, poppier work. It's not as dark as Zen Arcade, but it has just as much power and emotion. But probably the most stunning thing about this album is that it was made over 15 years ago, and it does not sound dated one bit. New Day Rising blows away the crap that tries to be passed off as music these days. \"Celebrated Summer,\" \"59 Times The Pain,\" \"Terms Of Psychic Warfare,\" \"If I Told You,\" \"Folklore,\" \"I Don't Know What You're Talking About,\" and \"Plans I Make\" should blow your mind. And while the production may sound lacking at first (the drums sound kind of muffled at times), it actually does the album justice upon further listening. Forget the marketed fake angst of much of today's rock and listen to New Day Rising. This is arguably the best Husker album out there. It really makes me sad though that these guys are one of the BEST BANDS EVER, and they still have not gotten the due they deserve. You MUST buy this.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"What is it with the negative mentality from fans when a lead singer goes solo? I am glad I grew up during a different era when it was just fine for a lead singer to go solo with fans. For example, Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins, David Lee Roth, Peter Cetera, Jon Anderson, etc., etc. Nowadays it seems there's this negative element involved for no really good reason.\n\nBrandon Flowers of The Killers releases his first solo album and it's, \"This isn't what I expected\" or \"This is another Killers album\" or \"The fans who give this positive reviews are deluded\", etc., etc. The fact of the matter is The Killers are popular right now, \"Flamingo\" entered the Billboard Top 200 Albums Chart in the top ten, the first single \"Crossfire\" has done well on the charts.\n\nAlso, Flowers brings in the heavy artillery with three great producers: Stuart Price (New Order, Madonna, Scissor Sisters, Pet Shop Boys, Gwen Stefani, Seal and Keane), Daniel Lanois (U2, Peter Gabriel and Robbie Robertson) and Brendan O'Brien (Stone Temple Pilots, Pearl Jam, Rage Against The Machine, Korn, The Offspring, Train, Bruce Springsteen, Incubus, The Music, The Wallflowers, Audioslave, The Bravery, Velvet Revolver and AC\/DC). This has ensured a quality product. Plus a duet with Riley Kilo's lead singer Jenny Lewis on \"Hard Enough\".\n\nI listened to all three Killers albums in sequential order prior to listening to \"Flamingo\", and I have to say I liked \"Flamingo\" slightly more than The Killers albums. This is the first album where I felt there was a musical unity throughout. I did not feel, upon repeated listening, that there were any weak tracks here. Some are better than others, but overall the album sounded good, not great. Flowers (and The Killers) still have the potential to develop into a classic rock band, but they have yet to hit their stride.\n\nGrowing up in the 1980's, this album reminded me of many other artists\/bands from that era with a modern polish, and The Killers are, after all, a retro band, a post-new wave revival band. Flowers' influences are also from that era, and they are evident here.\n\n\"Welcome To Fabulous Las Vegas\" is a great, grand, sweeping opener. \"Only The Young\", the album's second single, is a beautifully sung, electronic ballad. \"Hard Enough\" has a country tinge with a carefully placed hook in the chorus. \"Jilted Lovers & Broken Hearts\" is the most Killers sounding track and one of the fastest paced tracks here. \"Playing With Fire\" might be the weakest track here, but it redeems itself in its melody line during the second half of the song. \"Was It Something I Said?\" has a good melody. \"Magdalena\" is pure vocal hook magic. \"Crossfire\" is likewise catchy and melodic. \"On The Floor\" and \"Swallow It\" finish off the original 10 track album with more hooks. The four bonus tracks are equally as good with \"The Clock Was Tickin'\" and \"Jacksonville\" being very catchy.\n\nOverall, \"Flamingo\" deserves four stars for its great production and hooks galore. Anyone can quibble over the lyrical content here, and many have complained about the religious content, but I inspected the lyrics online and did not feel Flowers was being overly preachy. I mean give me a break here. There are so many other artists that are absolutely preachy in their convictions, and who cares? That's what's great about popular music--passion, conviction, opinions, points of view, attitudes. People are so easily perturbed by the smallest things.\n\nHere's how \"Flamingo\" compares to The Killers:\n\n2004 Hot Fuss: Four Stars\n2006 Sam's Town: Three and a Half Stars\n2008 Day & Age: Three and a Half Stars\n2010 Flamingo: Four Stars (from a biased, non-zealous fan)","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"I have to admit I didn't know what to expect from this CD but was very pleasantly surprised. I had heard \"I Don't Want To Be\" on the radio and loved it. On a whim, I bought the CD when I was out shopping, and didn't expect the rest of the album to be so consistently good, but it is. While \"I Don't Want To Be\" remains my favorite track on the CD, there are numerous other standouts as well including the popular \"Chariot\" and \"Over-Rated,\" another of my favorites.\n\nThe beauty of the album is the eclectic amalgamation of styles from pop (obviously,) rock, and blues, with a weird alternative undercurrent. DeGraw undoubtedly has a powerful singing style (though he occasionally flirts with giving an overwrought performance,) and has clear command of the material and the needed vocal range to pull off these songs. For those of you who doubt this, give a listen to the bonus disc, \"Stripped,\" and his interpretation of the Sam Cooke classic \"Change Is Gonna Come.\" \"Stripped\" was one of the big reasons I bought the CD versus just downloading a few choice tracks: I love hearing alternate, unenhanced versions of music (e.g. \"Unplugged,\") and while not simply DeGraw and a guitar or piano (there are rhythm and drum parts) I really enjoyed \"Stripped.\" In fact my initial inclination was to give the album four stars due to some homogeneity in the songs as originally presented, but \"Stripped\" changed my mind, and made the five star rating the only logical choice. On balance I still prefer listening to \"Chariot\" in its original form, but \"Stripped\" provides a refreshing alternative approach to the material and the bonus of \"Change Is Gonna Come.\" You might not think a young guy like DeGraw could pull off the Cooke civil rights watershed, but he does so convincingly and respectfully.\n\nI am surprised I liked this CD as much as I did as I am not generally a fan of the genre, but DeGraw is clearly a talented performer and has genre-defying dynamism: \"Chariot\" is a really good effort, and will provide hours of listening pleasure.","classification":5,"fold":6}

It gives the whole album an emptier vibe than I think John really wanted. \"Green Light\" is the only upbeat track here that I like. He steps out from the piano here and this song lights up the room. It just works. \"Everybody Knows\" and especially \"This Time\" are also really good tracks. \"Quickly\" featuring Brandy is OK but gets old. \"No Other Love\" featuring Estelle fairs a bit better and is a song you can get through without cringing. There is depth to be heard in some of the lyrics to the songs. In fact I really like when John is talking about not having love anymore cause here, like on \"Everybody Knows\" it really works. I felt his pain on that track. But most of the hooks here fall flat. I was shocked that I hated the majority of the album as much as I did. I honestly wouldn't care if I never heard this album again in my life. Yes, it's that bad, John. To put it bluntly he will only have to half try on his next CD to come up with better material than this because he's talented. But this is a mess. Seriously.\n\nSo average it's painful.

{"text":"First, let me say that I am glad seeing this many reviews pop up after being released for only three days! It shows a definite interest and healthy discussion about the \"legendary\" band Yes. Keep 'em coming. After following  Yes for over 4 decades I have to weigh in.\n\nWhile I so desperately wanted to dislike the CD, I must admit that I just cannot. It is a solid piece of work. Granted, it is no 5 star and will never be destined to be a Yes \"classic\". Those days are long gone for Yes, as they are for any once dominant musical group of the 70's and 80's. The reason I wanted to dislike \"Fly From Here\" was because of all the issues surrounding the departure of Jon Anderson. Can there be a Yes without Jon Anderson. I think we all need to remember here that the only consistent torch bearer in Yes is Chris Squire. He is THE ONLY member who has been on virtually every single album\/CD containing the title of Yes. Dare I say Yes is Chris's group. I say Yes is Chris's group. If you read any history of Yes it was Chris who spent months, locked away, honing his signature bass sound that became the foundation of all Yes music. So...can there be a Yes without Jon Anderson, of course, there already has been. So, all personal feelings aside, this is a good release without Jon Anderson. (Personally, much better than \"Open Your Eyes\" and \"Magnification\") Different without him, but it does not deserve to be rated as \"bad\" because of it.  One can dislike it for other reasons but don't just dismiss it because Jon is not the vocalist. Let me just break it down into some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\nYou still have one of the most recognizable, and best, rhythm sections in rock music with Steve Howe, Chris Squire, and Alan White. You have solid song writing with the unmistakable Yes sound. They bring back extended pieces of music rather than the short pop style of songs found on such works \"Open Your Eyes\" and \"Big Generator\". Geoff Downes  is a suitable keyboard replacement, although a bit unimaginative. (He does what he needs to do, about the same at Patrick Moraz  did.) (Downes played on Drama.)Keyboards have always been a revolving door with Yes anyway so you get used to different sounds. (I know, I know, Wakeman was the best. But then he is \"world class\") A really nice variety of song styles and lengths. You even get a solo acoustic number by Steve, \"Solitaire\".  It has been ages since we have had one of those on a new Yes release.\nCons:\nTrevor Horn as the producer. The producer is so instrumental (no pun intended) in the way a group will sound on any particular release. I have never been fond of the way he makes Yes sound. He was responsible for the \"90125\" and \"Big Generator\". If you liked the way those works sounded then you will probably not have a problem with FFH. Personally, I think he makes them sound too sterile, too 80ish if that is actually a sound. Jon Anderson is not singing. I am not saying that Benoit David does not do a fine job. I can just hear different parts where Jon's voice would be much more appropriate and his interpretations much better in fitting with the music.\n\nSo the pros and cons really cancel each other out. This is a piece of work that everyone will have a different take on, simply based on who you like and who you don't like. Bottom line to me, it is a good Yes release, regardless of the players, and I like it. I am not going to say it is a \"must buy\" but I really can't think that any fan of Yes would be totally disappointed either.  Hence the 3 stars. You may like it, or you may not, but buy it to support the band. Good luck finding it in a store. It is a small label with limited distribution. (I gave up after checking three major music sellers.)  I would just order it on line or down load it.","classification":3,"fold":6}

Thus, there is no new material here, but this compilation is the strongest single CD of Dwight's music so far released.\n\nInevitably, some classic songs have been omitted, one example being The heart that I own.

{"text":"When i think of GOOD Christian music... i think of stuff that sounds melancholy to hopeful.... has a message about one or more of the aspects of Christianity... takes it's stuff seriously and DOESN'T try to make a hip-hip-hooray song of it... and has beautiful or thoughtful lyrics.\nNow... most of Toby's stuff IS happy... and the reason it doesn't fit into the blah christian music category is because it's more inspirational music than evangelical. This on the other hand, IS evangelical, and it's amazing. One of the best Christian songs I've ever heard.\n\nLose My Soul is about us... as Believers... going through our lives attempting to serve and please our God, Jehovah... even as the world and it's material things pressure us and call to us, pulling us away. We can't afford to go that route, ladies and gents. How does it profit a man if he gains the whole world... but loses his very soul? OH. It brings shivers. So much is at stake.\n\nIt's a powerful song with a great message. Very peaceful and mindful melody. Great lyrics. TobyMac, Mandisa and Kirk Franklin performing a great collaboration. And all of it comes together and serves us fanboys (and girls) with a perfectly delivered message.\n\nIt's awesome. Add it to your library. And enjoy it.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Debby Boone was a mere toddler when her dad Pat Boone was hobnobbing with the Rat Pack, Barbra Streisand and all the showbiz elite in Las Vegas.  Yet, she must have had her eyes opened, taking mental notes and indulging in the splendor, as Debby Boone returns many moons later to do what her dad did best.  With her new show at Caf Carlyle and her ensuing new record entitled Swing This, Boone is back to performing a whole omnium gatherum of songs associated with the Rat Pack era.  Yet, Boone is no stranger to swinging jazz as she is married to Gabriel Ferror who is the son of the late great Rosemary Clooney (and incidentally also the cousin of actor George Clooney).  This is by no means Boones first attempt at nepotism: way back in 2005, Boone recorded Reflections of Rosemary, a tribute album to her mother-in-law. Now, backed by her mother-in-laws nine piece band directed by John Oddo, Boone re-visits some of the treasured standards of bygone past such as Irving Berlins Be Careful, Its My Heart, Mercer and Arlens That Old Black Magic and Lee Hazelwoods These Boots Are Made for Walking.\n\nThose with long memories would recall that Debby Boones first claim to fame was when her debut solo record You Light Up My Life became an unprecedented hit spending 10 consecutive weeks at Billboards number one spot.  This then is followed by a long and successful career in both pop and country music.  Especially in country music, when the genre was mostly male-dominated, Boone became one of the few ladies to regularly visit Billboards Country Top 10 Singles category.  Then in 1980, Boone began channelling her career into Contemporary Christian music. She started off with aplomb when her song With My Song won her a Grammy Award.  Then she went on to record 4 Christian albums all of which were highly successful with 3 of them landing in the top 10 of Billboards Christian album chart.  Later, due to popular demand, Curb Records has had re-issued all her Christian albums and she has also re-recorded many of her hits and hymns too.  Though Swing This is by no means a religious record, the themes of love and relationships so dear to the Scriptures pervade right through these 14 tracks.\n\nReminding one of the refrain in Song of Solomon not to awake love until the time is right loves irrepressible power is both negatively and positively expounded through these songs.  Mack the Knife, most commonly associated with Louis Armstrong and Bobby Darin is a prime example of the former where a love that has gone awry leads to a facetious dramatic outcome.  Boones animated storytelling prowess gears us up with suspense and intrigue right through this deftly crafted story song.  But shes less convincing on These Boots Are Made For Walking.  Somehow Boones more languid delivery lacks the sassy strutting bravado attitude that the song requires.  Lyrically one of the music most descriptive songs of love lost has to be Cry Me a River.  Here Boone incarnates brilliantly the tortured nature of a soul who has just experienced a love lost.\n\nOf the songs that display a more positive side of love is Get Me to the Church on Time.  Nowadays, we have lots of love songs exalting the gore of one night stances but songs that celebrate marriage and a union blessed by God are far and in between.  With the lovely bell chimes, Boone captures all the joys of a bride-to-be on Get Me to Church on Time.  Sounding more and more like Rosemary Clooney, Boone redefines intimacy with the piano-led Everybody Loves Somebody.  And she removes all emotional scaffolds with the tender Be Careful, Its My Heart.  At 56 years old, Boone shows on Swing This that she can still move heartswhether she sings of love found or lost  she sings as if they are her own life experiences lifted straight out of the pages of her own diary.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"I first saw MMJ on Austin City Limits, doing mostly stuff from \"Z\", and I thought it was just outstanding. Like many of their fans, I'm a big fan of Alt-Country, but am always looking for something new - a different twist - so I've continued to follow this group. I'm not too taken with their current direction, one that seems very commercial, void of the organic, and of little substance. Still, I like the group and have faith they're very talented folks, willing to take chances, and unwilling to get stale and predictable.\n\nAs this record starts out, I sense I'm hearing a theme song from a Disney movie, with the cheery little tune and message in \"Believe\". Still, the overall tone of this album is pleasant to listen to, and as other reviewers have noted, it is cohesive and flows nicely. I'll be listening to it despite my reservations about its' place in the MMJ catalog. I'm just hoping this is musical adventure that  is going to evolve into something more interesting. Otherwise, I think MMJ may as well resign themselves to creating soundtracks for Disney - cute and bubbly.\n\nI'll remain a big fan of much of their previous work, and expect further evolution on the part of the band. No doubt there are many more adventures to share from a band so talented.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"This very well may be one of the shortest reviews I have ever written, but the truth is there really isn't much TO say about Maroon 5's latest album, \"V.\" It's a straightforward, uncomplicated pop record and enjoyable enough in the moment, but with its lack of catchy hooks and overabundance of generic, shallow lyrics, it also strikes me as instantly forgettable.\n\nNot that it doesn't have its moments. The lead single, \"Maps,\" piqued my interest with its unique melody line, and \"Unkiss Me\" is a mid-tempo ballad which has Adam Levine showcasing a lower vocal register which suits him rather well. A personal highlight is \"It Was Always You,\" a smooth electro-groove which reminds of me something Rick Astley would be proud of. (And yes, I totally mean that as a compliment, lol.) Unfortunately after the first four or five tracks the shine wears of, and the rest of the songs become indecipherable from one another. No catchy choruses to sing along with, no thought-provoking lyrics, and certainly nothing that will go down as a Maroon 5 classic several years from now. Like I said, nothing here is offensively terrible in itself - well, except for maybe \"Sugar,\" in which Levine's squealing reaches cringe-worthy new heights - but as an album it just feels so bland and uninspired. Plus, watching this band of 30-something men compromise their artistic integrity in trying to relate to the mindsets of 12-year-old girls just doesn't work, and is in fact kind of sad. No disrespect intemded as I realize that's the market for radio these days, but I imagine they're alienating a good segment of their original fan base in doing so. Of course, Maroon 5's entire catalog going back to the \"Songs About Jane\" days is nothing if not catchy pop, but that's the key word - catchy - and up until the \"Overexposed\" era it was music you could tell they at least WANTED to be making. Unfortunately the good majority of \"V\" comes off as not much more than random button pushing.\n\nIn spite of those criticisms I do still consider myself a fan. But personally I think they peaked with the underrated \"Hands All Over,\" an album which successfully managed to blend meaningful songwriting with mainstream pop sensibilities which resulted in nearly every track having its own distinct identity. (\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\" remains their best CD overall, in my opinion.) Ideally I would rate this about 2.5 stars, but I'm rounding up to three giving it the benefit of the doubt. I have certainly heard worse, and I'm not going to throw it in the garbage or anything like that. It just won't be leaving the shelf very often.","classification":3,"fold":6}

That is definitely the case with the song Diane Warrne penned for her, Spanish Guitar. The song is absolutely very bold and brilliant from what the song captures through Toni's voice, and is honestly one of my favorites from Toni top to bottom. While people will always go back into Diane's other big one from Toni, Un-Break My Heart, this song is definitely worth a deep listen from the seductive soul. Tell you the truth, the song was originally written for Celine Dion, but a good thing she passed it up. While many people overshadowed Pulse, this pulse of a intimate guitar is the best from Toni's heat anyday.\n\nSong: A 1\/2-","classification":5,"fold":6}

Slow acoustic guitar subdued band and twang vocal. Very nice.\n\nNext up The Yayhoos with What Are We Waiting For. Strong vocal busy band on upbeat 'chorus is the title' listen to it live in a bar track. Great song.\n\nTrack 4 Trailer Bride playing Hope Is A Thing With Feathers. Deliberate opening bland female vocal a few noises over simple song with lady playing a wood saw throughout. (I checked YouTube). Nice song.\n\nThe Meat Purveyors bring us Hey Little Sister. Great high speed sounds like fiddle, box w\/one string, banjo recorded on the porch song. Brilliant.\n\nBlacks sing Fake Out Jesus. Nice vocal opens, band joins in, story tellin' song. Nice.\n\nTrack 7 is Devil In A Wood Pile with Good Morning School Girl. Harmonica playin' summer time song sounds very old, we're back on the porch sounds cool.\n\nGotta Get Back To Forgetting You by Rex Hobart & The Misery Boys. Much more upbeat than the song title and band name suggest. Great straight forward hoedown at the Big Barn two step song. I must be in the mood sounds great.\n\nThe Riptones are Out All Night. They played this at the Big Barn to. Nice tune zips along. Guess what it's about.\n\nTrack 10 is Flash by The Sadies. More intense country song zooms along sounds like it was recorded next door, good track.\n\nRico Bell & The Snakehandlers play Merseyside. Speedy beat telling story good words sounds cool. Yee Haw.\n\nMoonshine Willy has 18 Wheels and he's singing about them. I'm pretty sure I heard a washboard in there somewhere. Mostly vocal with instruments keeping up. I'm smiling as the song plays.\n\nLast up The Waco Brothers with Nothing To Say. That ain't true. Active band behind in your ears singer.

{"text":"Jazz is a pretty broad genre.  When I think of jazz, one thing I think of is the dialog between the musicians... the breaks and solos taken by various members of the group... for example, the interplay between the saxes and brass and drums... a lot of improvisation.  I don't hear much of this spontaneity and interplay in the Green Hill Jazz Sampler, so to my ear it's \"not quite jazz.\"\n\nMany of the pieces sound more like \"dance band\" music than \"jazz\" to me.  Some of the pieces might qualify as \"smooth jazz\" ... that hybrid eunuch of a format that is, nonetheless, often very pleasant listening.  Some pieces don't even go that far, IMHO; for example Fascination Waltz (certainly an old musical standard) bears no resemblance to what I think of as jazz.  Some (especially the vocals) are \"lounge music\" to my way of thinking.\n\nStill, some of the arrangements are fairly spirited and jazzy.  Bill Bailey, and Alexander's Ragtime Band, are pretty authentic to my ear.  No argument there.\n\nAll in all, the Sampler is quite listenable, although perhaps more as background music, rather than foreground.  It's an interesting mix of the \"Jazz\" palette.  All the arrangements are good, and the playing is meticulous, so it's a very polished collection.  I'm glad it's part of my library, and I'll listen to it again in the future.","classification":4,"fold":6}

With a set of deviating deaths in R&B legends we've lost this year with Natalie Cole, Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire, but honestly no death is more shocking and sad than the passing of Prince. The guy not only was brilliant, but his sound and song with R&B, funk, jazz and Rock is and will always transcend beyond boundaries in the way that David Bowie kept rolling with the tides years earlier. The guy really had so many memorable, that he had kept changing with time and everyone followed so deeply with the punches, and not bashing him at heart. When Doves Cry is one of his deepest songs from Purple Rain. The song still ignites aflame that can definitely showcase his sensuality in song, with a deep soul from his heart that really showed his sensitivity in song.

{"text":"Emmylou wrote most of the lyrics for the songs on this album;and she wrote them from her heart and soul. She tells us through these songs that her hife has been a \"hard bargain\".Yes,she has had her trials and tribulations,but by baring her thoughts and soul in these songs;she is not asking for sympathy.\n I have been a fan of her and her music for over 25 years,and have always felt that her music was ,above all else,true to herself. This has never been more evident than in these songs.\n I really enjoyed many of the Reviews here,some I did not agree with,but everyone is entitled to their opinion.\n A lot of the reviews were less than enthused with the music,and felt that it drowned out Emmylou's,magnificent and distinctive voice. With that I agree,but be that as it may,I still feel her excellent voice more than offsets that. I reacall an interview with Emmylou where she said she wished they would get their music out of the studios and back in the living rooms where it came from and belongs. I wish she had done that here,as it would have enhanced her songs.\n The songs are very sad and lonely and straight from the soul and experiences Emmylou has had with the people who meant so much in her life. For that reason,it is unlikely that many of these songs will be recorded by other artists. It wouldn't make sense because there is no denying ;these are her songs,and would lack believeability if sung by others.\n My only hope is that Emmylou's life has had her share of rewards and happiness along with the sadness and loneliness conveyed in this album--God knows she deserves it.\n\n By the way,the CD comes with a booklet with all the lyrics to all the songs--you'll need it because the music drowns out many of Emmylou's words.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"This isn't the most fantastic jazz-trumpet-standards CD I've ever heard - that distinction belongs to something like Clifford Brown With Strings - but it's still a real solid effort from Chris Botti.  His tones on these songs are as clear and pure as a mountain spring, and the song selection is well designed for those who want to get \"in the mood for love.\"  I like the fact that there's a mix of traditional standards and more modern romantic songs.  Thus Sting's \"No Ordinary Love\" appears right after \"What'll I Do?\" and so on.  I think Botti has been unfairly labeled as a \"Smooth Jazz\" artist (a now ultra-bland subgenre that no self-respecting musician wants to be a part of - although they'll gladly take the sales...).  Certainly on this album his backing is more likely to satisfy classic jazz fans - no funky rhythm section and synthesized dance beats, just an orchestra, big band or acoustic ensemble.  And his straight-out horn blowing on songs such \"Let's Fall In Love\" (cool jazz riffs) should earn him a measure of respect.","classification":4,"fold":6}

His Holy Modal Majesty (what the hell did that mean?) is a wonderful jam, it must have influenced Duane Allman who was just coming into his own around this same time.\nThe Stills stuff is not quite as strong as the Bloomfield stuff. It Takes a Lot to Laugh..., a Dylan cover, is pretty good. Season of the Witch is totally re-imagined from the Donovan original. Still haven't decided what I think of it. You Don't Love Me sounds really dated, in my opinion. Man's Temptation & Harvey's Tune are not strong.\nAlas, the version I had doesn't include the 4 bonus tracks. I might have enjoyed hearing Albert's Shuffle & Train w\/o the horns, which definitely feel like they were plunked down rudely on top of the rest of the mix.","classification":4,"fold":6}

It's easily one of the best songs on the album, but not because PLANS is mediocre; \"Soul Meets Body\" is one of Death Cab for Cutie's best.  Ben Gibbard's lyrics border on poetry here, and his voice finds a place between mellow crooning and urgent singing.  The band's instrumentation is just as interesting as the lyrics: use of slight electronics, keys, mandolins.  The final line: \"a melody softly soaring through my atmosphere\" might as well be describing the song itself.  If you are looking for one song to convince you to listen to the band, \"Soul Meets Body\" might as well be it.  Fantastic song.","classification":5,"fold":6}

He is such a talented artist, but never would I have expected a recording like this to come from him!  From start to finish, this disc is awesome!  He pays tribute to the ole' Motown classic wonderfully, and I've also got a feeling that when you strip him of everything that people take for granted and what they expect from him, this is what you get.

But, his last song Good Kisser was good, but not honestly as good as he showed it before. His latest song, She Came To Give It To You, which features Nicki Minaj doesn't have the stride as his earlier songs. It also sounds a bit similar to Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines, by sampling the Marvin Gaye song, Got To Give It Up. Sadly, it loses a bit of the stride. Also, Usher and Nicki Minaj don't have a lot of chemistry teaming up voice and soul. I think Nicki should consider finding better, as for Usher he needs to really get better when his album comes up down the road. Hopefully, his next song will prove just that and he came to give it to us.\n\nSong: C 1\/2-","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"After experiencing a career rebirth of sorts piggy backing on Maroon 5's smash \"Moves Like Jagger\", Christina Aguilera's \"Lotus\" rides on the wave of that success. Lead-single \"Your Body\" is a sweaty stomper that takes no prisoners with its addictive \"Oh oh oh\" refrain.\n\n\"Lotus Intro\" is rather trippy with intricate vocal layering and slowed electro beats. The Dance\/Rock \"Army Of Me\" is the \"Fighter\" of the album, with the lines ''There's a thousand faces of me, and we're gonna rise up... for every time you wronged me, Well, you're gonna face an army, army of me\" set to angry thumping beats. \"Red Hot Kinda Love\" is a playful retro-tinged groove, the Electro Funk \"Make The World Move\" features her Voice co-coach Cee-Lo Green (though he is criminally under-utilized, you hardly notice he's there), the catchy \"Let There Be Love\" is Techno with stabbing synths, \"Around The World\" is set to Hip Hop\/Martial beats, while \"Shut Up\" is a sulky rocker set to Hip Hop Beats. There's nothing as tuneless as \"Woohoo\" or \"Elastic Love\" thankfully.\n\nThe rest of the album comprises ballads, with the Country-tinged \"Just A Fool\" featuring another Voice co-coach Blake Shelton. For those who like a good holler, there's \"Sing For Me\", sure to be a regular on future episodes of The Voice, X Factor, or Idol. The best ballads though are The spare piano ballad \"Blank Page\" which finds her confessing \"I know there's pain, but people change, Lord knows I've been no saint\", the epic \"Cease Fire\" which is set to skittery martial beats, the rather lovely guitar-driven Pink-style \"Circles\" which finds her inviting some unlucky person to \"Spin around in circles on my middle finger\", and the anthemic \"Best Of Me\".\n\nIt's not quite the blockbuster it could have been (the tracklist could do with a little trimming), but still, a welcome return to form.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Tegan and Sara have produced an energetic collection of pop-fused melodies on their album Heartthrob that contain an uncanny sound reminiscent of timeless songs from the eighties from artists such Cyndi Lauper and Roxette.  This record is not so much a departure from the duo's eclectic style that fans have grown accustomed to but rather a maturation of their creativity as artists and musicians - a step ahead of what they have been performing for over a decade.  Indeed, they have grown and the production on this record shows.\n\nListeners may find a favorite tune in the set of ten tracks but all are worth a listen.  But for this listener, the undeniable comparisons are noticeable from not only the eighties genre but present day artists.  All of the tracks can easily be singles off the record, of course, the catchy \"Closer\" has already landed that distinction within mainstream radio, which has a tinge of Katy Perry or Keisha quality, especially in the chorus and driving beat and rhythm, \"I'm Not Your Hero\" is quite good and a bit of P!nk in the song, and back to the eighties,  think Cyndi Lauper for \"How Come You Don't Want Me\" and \"Goodbye, Goodbye,\" Roxette sounding \"I Was a Fool,\" and the Kate Bush-like \"Shock to you System.\"\n\nBut aside from the comparisons, Heartthrob is a good album to add to one's playlist for listening pleasure, especially during a warm afternoon driving down the road with the volume turned up.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"This is, by far, Lopez's best work -- and it's about damned time, too -- what the heck have you been waiting for, Jenny...?!! Using just the right mix of Latin rhythm structures with an interpolation of Lambada, RedOne (the Producer, here) mixes this perfectly; the hint of exotica is slight enough to be barely discernible... which is correct for mass market radio, and yes indeed: RedOne has this crafted with radio firmly in mind. I first heard this on middle-of-the-night club radio, and initially assumed it was an unknown Euro-import -- and was delighted to find that it was no such thing (I do hear a touch of dubstep there in the bass line (but  hey, I heard grime in Britney's HOLD IT AGAINST ME, too, so take that for what it's worth), and I definitely like the idea of ANY dubstep (even if it's just a hint) breaking big in American pop). I'd bet you even-money odds that Lady Gaga is screaming at RedOne's answering machine right now that she didn't get this for her follow-up to THE FAME. It's a monster of a record.\n\nAt 130 beats per minute, RedOne shows a monumental grasp of musical SENSE, here. It would have been VERY tempting to speed this thing up -- and I have no doubt that most DJ's out there will be trying to do just that with their upcoming wave of re-mixes -- but RedOne has this exactly right: 130 BPM, and in common time... clocked for radio, and clocked CORRECTLY. Kinda hard to believe he got agreement from JLo to keep it this \"slow.\" Too, the song is in a very unusual key for dance-pop; my ears have it in E-flat Minor, which is Metallica territory as far as keys go (usually, anything written in E-flat Minor is guitar-originated (the guitar is tuned to E by default), and that makes it a highly unusual key for material in this genre). The key gives the track a slightly darker tone -- and allows the bass line to truly SLAM. It's good work; I like the whole thought-process, here. Lopez delivers her vox with a touch of authority; she comes across with AUTHORITATIVE CLASS. The hook is instantly accessible; there is no need to hear this one a dozen times to get the earworm stuck in your head. Once you hear it, you're stuck with it RIGHT AWAY.\n\nTell you something, here: if Lopez can break this massive radio-friendly unit as big I think she can (and will), a Lambada \"comeback\" (in general) market-wide would not surprise me. Those of you inside the music business might want to think about bidding for the back-rights to the original Lambada. Owning something like that within your back-catalog is worth a mint when something as heavily-derived as this thing is comes along (plus, given the name here (Lopez), you know the push will be mighty indeed).\n\nToo, the song is an open invitation to re-mixers. There's so much here to re-mix that I'm glad I'm not spinning the noise for a living. I wouldn't even know where to begin de-constructing this one. We'll be hearing variation of this for a good long while.\n\nIn other words:\n\nThank you, Jenny.\n\nMay we have another...?","classification":4,"fold":6}

My friend tries her best in trying to get me to like him, but it's virtually impossible. She's \"made progress\" with that, however...but I'm going off on a tangent, so let me bring it back.\nI have mixed feelings about Chris Brown. Yes, he's a talented artist, but I'll never look at him the same again after he beat the crap out of Rihanna. With respect to this song, he added a nice element with the singing part in the beginning, but his speed rap obviously can't touch that of Busta Rhymes'. All this is done to a sick beat.

{"text":"Poor Katharine McPhee has never received the critical accolades she is so worthy of.  She definitely deserved to win American Idol against Taylor Hicks.  There was no comparison but Ms. McPhee is one of those women who is so beautiful on the outside that many people ignore the inside.  She is lovely and beautiful indeed but many critics just think she has a simple pleasant voice and she possesses so much more.  I love her new look and hairdo as she asks to have her vocals heard.  I was one of those who did not love her debut cd.  It was too poppish for me and didn't show off her great vocals and versatility.\n\nA couple of years have passed and Katharine McPhee has grown up a lot.  When I first heard this cd I didn't know what I thought and honestly would have given it 3 stars at that point.  But after hearing it over and over I love it.  There are no tracks here that are standout hits so you must listen to each track as its own.  Most of the songs are ballads and only with the intense listening will you find the quality and versatility that is actually here.\n\nIt would have helped to have some uptempo tracks to break up the ballads so that they could have been appreciated more.  Standouts of the ballads are SURRENDER, LAST LETTER, SAY GOODBYE and FAULTLINE.  Interestingly my least favorite track is the title UNBROKEN.  ANYBODY'S HEART has Katharine's vocals velvety like silk and DRIVIN and TERRIFIED are excellent displays of her vocals.  The most uptempo here are poppish ballads LIFETIME, HAD IT ALL and the fun BRAND NEW KEY.\n\nI still feel like Katharine McPhee has not been matched with the ultimate music to show her true artistry and versatitlity.  Listen to her sing SOMEWHERE on the David Foster and Friends cd\/dvd and you will see what she is capable of.  But she does well here and I am very grateful for SAY GOODBYE and LAST LETTER.  I am a huge fan and just wish that this cd had some strong tracks for singles to draw more listeners in.  Katharine McPhee is still a rising star yet to meet her highest mark but UNBROKEN is a strong positive step.  There is great talent here and I can't wait to see what comes next.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Jackie Wilson began his career as a solo artist when in 1953 he was offered an opportunity to replace Clyde McPhatter in the legendary R&B group Billy Ward and His Dominoes. Jackie made several memorable sides with the group before signing with Brunswick in 1957. Once again flying solo, Jackie Wilson would record dozens of hit records over the next decade. Of all of those terrific recordings my favorite has always been the remarkable \"To Be Loved\" from 1958. Feel the sheer exhilaration of a person who firmly believes that someone actually loves him.

{"text":"Drenched in guitars and strings, and in a minor key, \"There Is A Tree\" hooked me the minute Carrie began to sing, and from there the album never lost my interest.  Thoughtful, unusual songs yet sound familiar, and upon a second listen, feel like old friends.  The instrumentation, although relatively spare, sounds full and rich, complimenting Newcomer's lovely, alto voice perfectly, without ever stealing the spotlight.  A few tracks have gentle, sometimes driving rhythms, and there are subtle yet surprising sounds around every bend, so there's enough variety to keep THE GEOGRAPHY OF LIGHT from becoming too somber.  In fact the title and the cover art are quite apt, as the general mood of this wonderful CD does remind me of one of those days when half the sky is dark with a passing storm, yet clear enough in spaces to let shafts of golden sunlight through.\n\nA couple of side notes: not only has Carrie written perhaps the only song ever sung about geodes, but she then ends this elegant album on an upbeat note with \"Don't Push Send,\" a highly amusing ditty about the dangers of writing and sending letters in cyber-space.  Presumably, she calls this a \"bonus track\" because it's so different from the rest of the album, but it works, and I've quickly decided that it's not a throwaway; it belongs here...\n\nI've been listening to Carrie Newcomer's songs for many years, and have most of her albums on CD.  But it wasn't until 2000's THE AGE OF POSSIBILITY that I thought Carrie had finally done a truly solid album.  In 2002 and 2005, respectively, she released two more fine CD's, GATHERING OF SPIRITS and REGULARS AND REFUGEES.  The latter included a single from the previous release, a BEST OF collection, \"Betty's Diner\" which had been inspired by her own short story.  The subsequent album was all about the people she imagined as customers of said diner.  The conceit worked well, and I could hardly wait to hear what Newcomer would come up with next.  It would be a two-year wait, but it was worth it.  I believe Carrie Newcomer has topped herself and turned out her best album yet.  Not a false step here; this is a woman who has hit her stride.  She has always written compelling lyrics, but this time out, the the melodies, music and arrangements rise to their level in just about every instance.  If you like thoughtful, mature songs that are about something, and your taste runs toward the melodic, I can recommend this CD without reservation.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"There is honestly a difference between a singer, and being a product. Unfortunately for divas these days like Rihanna and Beyonce', they have chosen to overexpose themselves and choose to be products, not people, and sadly the songs have became so overplayed, their voices have slowly passed away. For other divas, like Vanessa Williams, whom has been very sophisticated at the soul, and very true to her own heart, and strong at the voice, her songs have remained so timeless. Nearly 30 years after Vanessa Williams broke from scandal and heartbreak, after the Miss America Pageant, she found her own voice again through music and acting, and made herself a  worldwide staple as a diva that has never gone out of style. One of my favorite songs, her staple Saved The Best For Last, is actually one of those songs that has sincerely gotten much better with age, and the soulful melody aligned. I adore this song each time I hear it, and if you have never heard a Vanessa Williams song before, than I recommend you download this beauty.\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":6}

He's a cut above in the vocal department - he doesn't need to do this.  I'm not a fan of his song selections and the direction he's gone in his career, with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock, where he shines, in my opinion.  But, I adore him and his fearlessness.  He's obviously doing what he loves and just because it doesn't resonate with me doesn't mean it's not worthwhile.

{"text":"As you start the first track, you have a feeling of being suspended in the sky, sunlight streaming through the clouds, and the colors of the sunset are breathtaking.  Lorne Balfe introduces his new theme to Terminator: Genisys in a tender and loving way.  Then the drums and low strings begin the rhythm and the theme is reintroduced with cellos, horns and the choir coming in, and you feel your spirit soar.  This soundtrack can go from 0 to 60 in about a second.  Track 2 (0) is a tender restatement of the original Terminator theme, but Track 4 (60) cranks up the heat, bringing a relentless drive to the music that is truly exhilarating.  Track 6 begins like a freight train bearing down on you, and he then pushes the pause button introducing some menacing, low synthesizer sounds.  One of my favorite tracks is Track 7.  It has that Assassin's Creed III feel to it which is one of my all time favorite soundtracks that Lorne Balfe has done.  It is intense and threatening with that pulse in the strings and drums setting up the tension.  Track 9 is that classic Terminator sound, and I can picture the machines giving chase to their objective.  Track 11 is another one that I really like, introducing a new theme, first with a trumpet and then with horns, having a driving beat and that heroic, epic feel.  Track 16, Judgment Day, unleashes the full power of the orchestra, as does Track 18, Fight, and you can clearly hear the anvil punctuating this piece of music.  The last track ends this soundtrack perfectly with Lorne Balfe's rendition of the classic Terminator theme.  Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I really hate it for Omarion because no matter how good it gets the competition keeps changing the game. This album in my opinion is a classic just like the last album. I do believe that a lot of reviewers who don't like this album ears are trained. Let me explain, See radio hits and album hits are in two different categories. Most people who listen to albums are unable to hear the difference there for when you right a review, you compare it to what you ear on the radio. Far from the case if you are to be fair or honest to someone who reads your review. I read one person compare this album to Joe's new album. You can't do that! Two different styles and age groups that these artists are after. This album is not his worst album. I would say that his first album maybe the worst then his second album although he some big singles on that second album the whole album wasn't that good. This album is consistent and is a strong classic R&B album. No other way to explain it! If you do not listen to all sects of R&B then you are cheating the reader and the artist as a reviewer. Omarion has really stepped his game up however being underrated shadows everything about his craft.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Jaheim came out on the scene pretty strong, selling double platinum with his debut album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ghetto-Love\/dp\/B00005899K\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ghetto Love<\/a>&nbsp;and then platinum with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Still-Ghetto\/dp\/B00006WKYJ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Still Ghetto<\/a>. And when his last album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ghetto-Classics\/dp\/B000BJ7CCY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ghetto Classics<\/a>&nbsp;only managed to go gold, things looked a little troublesome. This is especially true since Ghetto Classics was just as good as its predecessors, but Jaheim didn't get the push he deserved from his label and failed to chalk up the numbers he used to get in his prime. Now with Atlantic Records as his new label home, Jaheim hopes to re-up and capture the attention of his original fan base and millions more with his new album The Makings Of A Man. He keeps the formula the same for the most part, resorting to mid-tempo grooves and slow cuts for the majority of the album. After professing his worth with the intro track \"Voice of R&B.\" Jaheim lays it down with \"Hush,\" a song about keeping an affair with a homie's girl on the low. \"Have You Ever\" rides out with strong background vocals, simple piano work, and lyrics about speculating on what could have been and rethinking what has already been done. \"Lonely\" is a reworking of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Bobby-Womack\/dp\/B00004SATU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bobby Womack<\/a>'s \"If You Think You're Lonely Now,\" using the infamous hook for the song but changing the lyrics to reflect Jaheim's own tale of scooping up the next girl and her man is the one sitting at home all alone! \"Life of a Thug\" is a depiction of Jaheim's life in the form of an autobiographical song, describing all the trials and tribulations that he's faced over the years and his ultimate redemption from those trying times. He questions why a lover doesn't realize a good man when he's right in your face on the song \"Just Don't Have A Clue.\" For the track \"She Ain't You,\" Jaheim borrows the melody and background from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Delphonics\/dp\/B000EMGJTK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Delphonics<\/a>' classic \"La La Means I Love You\" for another reworking where he talks about his former girl still having his heart and wishing he could still be with her instead of anyone he's been with since losing her. Jaheim hangs up his player status for the love of his life on the album's lead-off single \"Never.\" \"I've Changed\" features the dynamic rawness of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Keyshia-Cole\/dp\/B000VDDCHO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Keyshia Cole<\/a>&nbsp;alongside his ghetto bravado, but the ridiculously child-like delivery of the chorus ultimately kills the song. Jaheim gets real on \"What You Think Of That\" where he describes realizing the true essence of a woman who was disrespected and unappreciated by a fool who didn't know what he had. \"Make A Wish\" is a smooth yet simple song about giving his girl whatever she wants and dreams of having, something every woman wishes were true! The album closes with the tender cut \"Back Together Again,\" a tribute to his parents who are now reunited in Heaven. Jaheim took his time with Makings Of A Man, and it truly shows in practically every track. If this doesn't convince the masses that he is the real thing, then this will certainly prove that people don't know true R&B talent when they see it...let alone hear it.","classification":4,"fold":6}

This may not be the most original album, bit its going to absolutely live on your turn-\n table.  These are the kinds of songs that sound immediately familiar, friendly & comfortable.\n There is no filler here; every single one is a stone-cold keeper!  Fresh and lively, hook-dominated\n tunes with 60s-influenced melodies that bounce along in a hallucinogenic fairy-dust guitar-pop\n sparkle.  If you appreciate prime power-pop, know which end of the bong to put to your lips and\n have ever closed your eyes to dance around the room with your headphones onthis is the\n album for you.  Reminiscent of a number of cool bands:  Tame Impala, the Brian Jonestown\n Massacre, Mmoss, the Byrds, MGMT, Asteroid No. 4, the Beatles, Robyn Hitchcock, Toy, Baby\n Woodrose, Strangers Family Band, etc.  Sun Structures is a strong early contender for best of\n 2014:  simple, pure & just brilliant!!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"As the lead singer and key songwriter of The Killers, it's not surprising to find similar and frequent references to Brandon Flowers' hometown of Las Vegas on his first solo record. From the album's title, named after the famous Vegas casino, to the opening track \"Welcome to the Fabulous Las Vegas,\" these references are also far from hidden. Although The Killers' second record, Sam's Town, drew many comparisons to Bruce Springsteen, Flamingo plays as if each call came straight from The Boss' playbook.\n\nDaniel Lanois, known for his longstanding production relationships with both U2 and Bob Dylan, lends his hand to Flamingo in a very characteristic fashion.\n\nThe delay effects heard on the album's lead single, \"Crossfire\" offer an airy effect reminiscent of nearly every U2 album while the added presence and clarity of the vocals within the mix puts the importance of the lyrics in focus. This is actually what sets Flowers' solo venture apart from the three existing Killers records.\n\nUnder The Killers' umbrella, guitar solos and more elaborate instrumental sections provide the driving force of the music, but Lanois' mixes keep all of the instrumentation ever so slightly in the distance.\n\nFans of The Killers will not be disappointed with Flowers' solo outing. There are less standout singles, but as a whole, Flamingo is an enjoyable side-step from the grandiose anthems The Killers have provided us for the better part of a decade.\n\nSimilar Artists: The Killers, Bruce Springsteen\n\nTrack Suggestion: \"Crossfire\"","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Let me start by saying that this is a great song, and I actually like what Timbaland did with the it, and actually prefer this version to the original. However, why did Timbaland give OneRepublic (the band that made the song), a \"featured\" spot. The guy just remixed the song, and added his voice to the background. Is that deserving of taking credit for you making the song? No. I mean, I'm not the biggest Timbaland fan mind you, I like \"The Way I Are,\" but really, this is an undue cheapshot. But, if he hadn't done this, then OneRepublic probably would have taken forever to put out their stunning debut, so in a way, it's actually a good thing. Still bad, but good came out of it.\n\nOverall, the song is still pretty great, and it deserved to be #1. But support OneRepublic and go buy their album, \"Dreaming Out Loud.\" It's a great CD that has this song, and the original, and enough other stuff to please most everybody.","classification":4,"fold":6}

But when it has came down to her, she has had a few strong surprises up her sleeve that have let her voice sincerely flow.

She delivers a more natural tone with her ballad very intimately, unlike more oversatured divas like Rihanna and Beyonce' have made in their songs. I was pleasantly surprised with the song from Jill. It definitely is a better ballad than what has shown to brew on radio. While everything lately on radio has been so much about Lady Gaga, what Jill has is a more natural feeling with her voice. It is a better song than what she had with Shame with Eve. If you're a huge Jill Scott fan, give Hear My Call a shot.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","classification":4,"fold":6}

I only own a couple of their albums right now, but I've heard a good share. In spite of all that, I'm a big fan, and I have HUGE respect for them, as any self-respecting metalhead should.\n\nNow, maybe I'm biased because I'm a bass player myself, but I like this album a lot. If you were to give it a label, I'd say it's \"progg-ish, melodic modern rock.\"\n\nThe bass is louder in the mix than on your average rock record. We're used to hearing the clang of Steve's bass on Maiden, but this material is very different. So it's a bit odd to have the bass so loud, but I don't think it kills it. Again, maybe I'm biased.\n\nAnd the singer is clearly not the most powerful one you'll hear, but his tone and delivery fit the tamer, more brooding type of rock that this album is exploring.\n\nI think that the fact that Steve can write in a different style, and assemble a different type of band and make it sound good is a testament to his talent, even if you don't particularly like the style. At least he's not a one trick pony.\n\nSteve, you're the man, a legend. Thanks for all the music, including this. \\m\/","classification":5,"fold":6}

I think it says something about the state of dance music. I mean, any top 10 hit is given a BPM, and sent to the clubs, and sometimes your radio. These songs are cheap shots at great music, and I take them as an insult. I mean, I can't tell whether we're supposed to dance or laugh at these \"re-mixes.\"\n\n\"Shake It\" is simple on the verses, which is typical of Metro Station, but they bring it on the chorus, and they bring it home in a big way. The chorus is catchy, fun, happy and it could start a new dance craze, if their was more of a dance to create.\n\nSo overall, the verses aren't that great, but the chorus is what makes the song.

{"text":"Mott the Hoople was one of those great rock and roll bands that was unfortunately just a tad too quirky to ever be accepted by mainstream audiences.  Though it doesn't contain thier best known song (the David Bowie penned \"All the Young Dudes\"), \"Mott\" still gets the nod as the band's best album.\nThe album features a healthy does of everything that made them great: unpredictable songwriting, fine guitar playing from Mick Ralphs (later of Bad Company), and the theatrical vocals of front man Ian Hunter.  The highlights include the catchy, horn laden \"All the Way from Memphis\" that kicks things off, the sequel to their David Bowie hit \"Hymn for the Dudes,\" the downcast autobiographical story song \"Ballad of Mott the Hoople\" and the goofy but sweet ballad \"I Wish I Was Your Mother\" that closes the record.  In between is a lot of typical Mott glam rock weirdness like \"I'm a Cadilac\" and \"Violence.\"  Though it lacks liner notes, the CD booklet does feature a full lyrics sheet.\nOverall, a terrific classic rock album from an underappreciated band.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"I pre-ordered this album and was able to download The Devil In I and The Negative One ahead of the full release date. I was beyond impressed with these tracks and was interested to see what I was in store for us on release day. Was it going to be a mix of heavy songs and slow moody songs? Was this going to be some good songs mixed in with a bunch of whiny, emo lyrics?\n\nIt is neither.\n\nThis album sets itself apart from the earlier releases while still maintaining that Slipknot attitude and sound. It is incredibly heavy and aggressive and I must mention the lyrics multiple times because they are outstanding. This album lacks nothing....musically or lyrically. I read an interview by Corey Taylor a couple of months ago where he stated this album would be heavy but also moody. This album is supposed to be a culmination of all the feelings and emotions the band has dealing with the last few years...especially with regards to the death of Paul Gray.\n\nWhile Slipknot certainly has reasons to put out an emotional, angry, hostile or even an emo album... they chose to release this album. It is emotional, it is angry, it is hostile and all of these emotions are put in their proper place amongst some great musicianship and amazing lyrics. I have always been a fan of Corey's writing style but the lyrics on 0.5 are on a new level. You can feel the anger and the pain these guys have felt in a musical package so well put together it can stand against any so-called \"emotional and meaningful\" album in any genre.\n\nSimply put...this album is amazing! Every Slipknot release until this point has had tracks I love and a few I can live without. I have listened to it from start to finish many times over and I love every track. I am in no way a Slipknot fan boy but they have outdone themselves with this release. Every track holds its own on this album and every track deserves your full attention. While it does have its moody parts, those parts do not take anything away from the rest of the album...they only compliment it. The moodiness is presented in a real and mostly aggressive manner and this album is never emo in any way.\n\n0.5 is raw...it is emotional...it is heavy...it is real.\n\nBuy this album.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I really, really enjoyed this record.  More than any new record I have picked up in a long time. In fact, I found this largely instrumental album to be far more enjoyable than anything the group has released since the time of The Final Cut (1983). The Endless River is also more \"progressive\" sounding than anything they have released in quite some time. Although everything must come to an end, it is a shame that they are packing it in - this music is really interesting and I would have liked to see where they were heading with this approach.\n\nThe Endless River is arranged in a song-cycle that is tied together by a few repeated themes. The music is classic Pink Floyd: doleful and played at a very slow tempo. Although largely instrumental, there is an excerpt of spoken word from scientist Stephen Hawking on \"Talkin' Hawkin', and the last track is the only one to feature a \"traditional\" vocal track courtesy of David Gilmour.\n\nAlthough based on recordings made during the Division Bell sessions, this music sounds nothing like the Division Bell.  There are subtle nods in the direction of past albums that are scattered here and there, but they do not dominate the recording.  This music is very \"Floydian\", yet at times sounds nothing like the band at all.\n\nOne aspect of the music that I loved was the keyboard playing of the late Rick Wright. It is ethereal, transcendent, yet always grounded. Rick favors very warm, clean tones on the Hammond organ and the synthesizer tone colors are reminiscent of the analog synthesizers that were in favor in the 1970s, e.g., mini-moog. There is even a snippet of Rick playing a pipe organ that was recorded in 1968.\n\nThe packaging is of the highest quality and features loads of group photos, most of which were taken during the Division Bell sessions. Given that Dave Gilmour indicated that The Endless River was a tribute of sorts to Rick Wright, I was surprised to not see any acknowledgement of that fact in the liner notes. The late graphic artist Storm Thorgerson is, however, acknowledged.  Storm founded the outfit Hipgnosis - they designed album covers for Pink Floyd, along with other progressive artists from the 1970s. Like all of the Pink Floyd albums, the sound quality is outstanding. The entire album has a very analog sound that is warm and intimate. There is very little compression and there is good separation of individual instruments.\n\nAll in all, this is a wonderful album that I have been playing constantly since I received it.  Although I am a little bummed that this will (in all likelihood) be the last time I enjoy a \"new\" Pink Floyd album, I am grateful for the enjoyment they have provided me since the time I first heard them (around the time of The Wall). So to the remaining members of Pink Floyd, here is a \"thank you\" and best wishes.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Neo Soul crooner John Legend hooks up with Hip Hop collective The Roots to release \"Wake up!\", a collection of covers of socially\/politically conscious Soul classics from the sixties and seventies. This has been a rather prolific year for The Roots as they released \"How I got over\" earlier in the year.\n\nBoth were inspired by the 2008 United States presidential election and chose songs they felt were obscure. The album has a loose live-jam feel to it with the only Hip Hop infusion being sporadic rapping by Black Thought or guest rappers.\n\nThe lone original composition is the church piano-driven \"Shine\". \"Humanity (Love the way it should be)\" is horn-sprinkled Reggae. They eschew the popular songs on Marvin Gaye's \"What's going on\" going for \"Wholy holy\".\n\nLead-off single \"Wake up everybody\" features Common and Melanie Fiona and is light and breezy. \"Hard times\" and \"Compared to what\" (with an incredibly groovy bassline and funky horns) are Funk\/Soul, \"Little ghetto boy\" an airy organ-driven Jazz\/Soul ballad, while \"I can't write left handed\" is a sprawling 12 minute epic, an anti-war lament originally done by Bill Whithers telling the story of a wounded war veteran writing a letter to his mother.\n\nEach song stands out really, and what prevents the album from being too depressing and preachy are the excellent vocals and superb musicianship. A much needed wake up call musically.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"The urge to merge:  instinctual as breathing and inevitable as growing up, there comes a time when Be Without You sounds better than Single Life and many start looking outward for legacy-building, contentment and companionship (spiritually and otherwise).  Dweles song catalog has always showcased the stages of love, but his sixth release, Greater Than One, delves deeper into murkier temptations and territories, using rich melodies, heightened harmonies and lucid lyrics to encapsulate a desire to commit without sacrificing the cool factor in the process.\n\nIf long-time fans or Dwele-come-lately listeners had high expectations due to his spectacular 2010 project, W.ants W.orld W.omen, the multi-instrumentalist, producer and songwriter doesnt disappoint: theres less bombast and boom-bap than on W.ants, since a distinctively 80s aura dominates this set, but its range is just as emotive and exciting.  Never one to phone in, the prolific Dwele writes or co-writes ten of the thirteen tracks while working the drum kit, keys and horns. Monica Blaire, Raheem DeVaughn, J Tait, L Renee and one-man hit machine Mike City contribute just enough of their talents to embellish Greater  without overtaking its direction.\n\nAs the opening interlude demonstrates, the 30+ performer is coming to terms with relinquishing the player card, but is not quite ready for rings, kids and SUVs just yet, a brutal truth that he paid dearly for in the bittersweet, horn-laden jazzy soul hybrid Going Leaving: She wanted more but I wasn't ready, me keepin it real made her heart heavy. I can admit it, scared me when she said where is this go-ING, I said Im not rea-DY, now shes leav-ING.she wants chil-DREN, OOOH.  One of the Mike City joints, the single What Profit, offers up syncopated rhythms and guitar-anchored grit on a cautionary tale about deserting your baby for the bling after getting large: Deep inside your mind down to the depths of your soul\/you see love lasts long, after all the money comes and goes. What profit a man to gain the whole world, but lose his girl. If I were your man, Id do all I can, to keep you Girl.\n\nJust as a relationship can arc outward as deeper emotions take root, the songs on Greater. ripple and resonate as Dwele wades into deeper levels of honesty and oneness. Takes22Tango is a sinuous and salty exploration of a love that has potential to steal the show when they get their vertical rhythm right, and Raheem DeVaughn helps to double-down on the give-her-good-love or else message during the mellow, but mesmerizing What You Gotta Do. Another intriguing track is Obey, with Dweles tenor solemnly promising happily-ever-after as synthesized notes swell and surge beneath a fragile reunion.  This Love is a 180-degree turn-around and a likely culmination at the jewelry store, jubilant and flush with affectionate awe for his newly-christened missus.\n\nDwele may be contemplating future monogamy, but the present still leaves room for partying, heard on the glib Must Be while trading verses with Black Milk, LRenee and J. Tait about the chaos that occurs when we aint sober and as hes wading through a Love Triangle, a folly that clicked into place after two friends with eyes for Dwele decide to..well, you can guess. Patrick Ronald (which mustve been conceived after a Prince\/The Time music marathon) is a club cut paying homage to the stomach-scraping beverage known as Patron that even allows Dwele to drop a few bars: That girl, she lookin good\/ she came up on me talmbout whassup I said my wood,\/ sorry, thats Patrick talkin. Frankly My Dear (Im Bennett I Aint Innit) closes with repentance when as he plays tug-of-war with his lust and his logic after discovering that last nights companion has a man: But you sure is fine, and right now you're mine\/I should just be hesitant and use my common sense. On my shoulders theres a good head, but I keep using my (bleeped out) instead.\n\nIn the decade since his self-distributed debut Rize, Dwele couldve stagnated within the neo-soul niche or chased bigger name recognition by dropping simpler and sex-starved R&B, but the Detroit native continues to evolve, fearlessly melding expansive lyrical insights with his masterful sense of musicality, making this CD an essential purchase and one of the Greater contemporary soul releases of 2012.","classification":5,"fold":6}

I saw him perform live this summer with my youngest sister and he confirmed what I already knew: he's very talented. Most of the songs on this album are so romantic.

{"text":"Roberta Flack's First Time Ever I Saw Your Face debuted on her first album FIRST TAKE in 1969 and took the radio waves by storm.  There wasn't a pop, soul, or even jazz station that was not playing it in regular rotation.  It rocketed Robert to instant stardom and her voice became one of the most recognizable ballad singers of the 70's.  One listen and you know there was a subtle and beautiful power there.  Modern soul\/R&B singers have not a clue as to how to command a vocal like this.  Now it is all about \"runs\" and unrestrained power.  Take a lesson everone, this is how you deliver a beautiful ballad.  If you want more, lay your ears on her cover of The Three Degrees \"Trade Winds\" another Roberta Flack hit that utilizes gorgeous vocal delivery, subtle jazz and soul instrumentation, and a slow burn to building crescendo.

{"text":"Jewel was at the very tail end of her 20s in 2003 when her fourth album \"0304\" was released.  But the photos that adorn the CD's layout -- oh my!  She is more gorgeous and youthful in them than girls 10 years her minor.  She has to be one of the most beautiful women in the world in fact.  She is the living definition of \"young and smart and sexy,\" to use the catchphrase she coined for this album.\n\nOK, so I've just now been open about my admiration for Jewel's looks, but the question is, does she have the music to back it up?  The answer is an unequivocal \"yes.\"\n\nSome reviewers considered \"0304\" to be something of a misstep for the Alaskan born singer\/songwriter, but I believe this to be one of her best albums.  The opener \"Stand\" is a classic.  It always brings me back to the first times that I heard this CD.  One of her best ever.  It and the other songs here demonstrate Jewel's knack for making odd references in her lyrics (see also the one to Charlie Sheen in \"Intuition\") that put a smile on the listener's face and make for memorable songs.  Beyond that, I love \"Leave the Lights On,\" a slower and more laid back track.  One thing that was new to Jewel's sound on this release was the use of electronica to create numbers tailor-made for any dance hall, something some fans of her past, more folkish tunes didn't take well to.  I for one love it.  Some of my favorite tracks here are the lesser known ones stacked at the end that are great for dancing or exercising to.  I mean, you just can't get more catchy than songs like \"Yes U Can,\" \"U & Me = Love,\" and the rousing track where Jewel demonstrates her love for her home country, \"America.\"  Excellent stuff.\n\nThere is actually not one weak track or moment of filler here though and Jewel sustains the listener's interest for the 53 minute duration of the CD, as only Jewel can, all the while proudly wearing her femininity and sex appeal on her sleeve.  The only reason I'm rating this album just shy of five stars is I liked the 2006 follow-up \"Goodbye Alice in Wonderland\" even slightly better.  Still, if you want to feel young and smart and sexy no matter what age you are, Jewel will show you how on \"0304.\"  Highly recommended.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"So this is Jewel. I was surprised when I saw the album cover a few months ago. Slowly but surely \"Intuition\" grew on me, it's a fun dance number about pop culture and materialism. I understand with this project now that Jewel wanted to encorporate her meaningful lyrics with dance music, showing that it is possible. It's not a sell out either, since this music isn't popular like it was a few years ago. Not to say it's bad by any means. The best track for me is \"2 Find U\", a nice love song. \"Run 2 U\" is another favorite. \"Leave The Lights On\" has a nice groove and reminds me a bit of Nelly Furtado. \"Haunted\" is another great track here. \"2 Become 1\" is a great love song. The album reminds me a bit of Sheryl Crow's second album, picking up strands of pop music and familiar lyrics, and including odd pop-culture references and name-dropping along the songs. This is still the same Jewel, just with dance beats. And it is her most enjoyable album yet. Overall fans might be taken aback but with an open mind, people will be sure to enjoy this CD.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"I am a huge fan of Reach Records, and I loved KB's debut album and previous mixtape. I like this release, the more Reach music out there the better! However, being an EP, its difficult to get a 5 from me because there is less content to \"grade.\" I'm personally not a huge fan of EPs because I tear through them so quickly, and my chances of landing that big hit song that comes with a good album is dramatically decreased.\n\nI consider myself lucky. None of these songs really top the best from KB's debut album, Weight & Glory, but some CAN for sure compete with them. 100 and Kamikaze are terrific songs, featuring great guest spots from Andy Mineo and Priscilla, respectively. Undefeated with Derek Minor is a good one as well. The remaining 3 tracks are all decent, and better than most of the stuff we still get from the CCR world, unfortunately. They're good songs, but they represent the low end of the release. Thats why its such a good EP.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is a very good release, but its not exactly a full album or mixtape, fully crammed with music and ideas. So hence the 4. Of course, I still strongly encourage anyone to purchase this, because you can never get too much of KB's music, and technically, if you can score 50% of the songs on a purchase as good as this time, its definitely worth it. So maybe this is a 4.5 EP and a 4 overall release.\n\nBreakdown\nGive My All: 3.5\n100: 4.5\nUndefeated: 4\nKamikaze: 5\nDoubts: 3\nCrazy: 3","classification":4,"fold":6}

Then you see some commercial for the ASPCA on TV and you have to go \"get something out of your eye\" in the bathroom for a few minutes. I've been there, man. Hell, we've all been there. Beach House have been bringing us dreamy, melancholy, and slightly druggy albums in the key of \"sigh\" for a few years now. Every since Devotion, each record has excelled at surpassing the previous ones grandeur and lamenting nature. Depression Cherry isn't changing the formula, but it has refined their wispy sound to a fine, hazy moan. If you're new to Beach House, don't let all the sappy, sadsack stuff dissuade you from hitting play on their new long player, or any of their albums for that matter. They're pieces of artful beauty.\n\nAlex Scally and Victoria LeGrand form the whole of Beach House, and they work together wonderfully. LeGrand has one of those timeless voices. It's a dark, smokey voice that gives the impression of years of good and bad; stories float within her cadences and lazy delivery. It's a voice that's aged much quicker than LeGrand's merely 34 years. Alex Scally creates these curtains of slow motion revelations in the music, which only accentuates the emotional heft LeGrand delivers. On Depression Cherry, Scally and LeGrand have given us a much needed autumn album. Songs filled with sage advice about love, life, and beyond. The passage of time and getting older is felt on these songs. \"Levitation\" slowly finds its way into focus like the ocean waves hitting the shore. There's no rushing to any conclusions. There's always a sense of heightened perception in a Beach House song. Like slow motion psychedelia. A giddy calliope carries you on some strange trip, with the gray of reality always in the distance. \"Sparks\" is the most upbeat song on the album, and possibly in the entire Beach House canon. With the most distorted guitar I've ever heard(or noticed) in a Beach House song, and with the melding of Scally and LeGrand's voices this song almost brings a Medicine vibe to mind. \"Space Song\" floats along nicely with a great slide guitar, steady bass, and some synth strings. Victoria LeGrand emotes wonderfully as always. This is the kind of song you'd play for someone new to the Beach House world and say \"This is what they sound like.\"\n\nThere's always been a Cocteau Twins sound with Beach House. Maybe not \"exactly\" like Cocteau Twins, but they both create this ethereal music that feels like AM pop music from some other alternate universe. It's both sad and happy. Beach House make sad music for happy people. \"Beyond Love\", \"PPP\", and \"Wildflower\" all hit hard in the gut, pushing the air from your lungs like a bit of sad news. But somehow, it's never depressing. Much like the same reason you sit and listen to songs like The Beatles' \"In My Life\", The Zombies' \"The Way I Feel Inside\", or Nick Drake's \"Way To Blue\", we somehow need that down to get back up. Maybe we're masochists at heart. Maybe I am. Either way, Beach House capture that longing we crave beautifully, and \"Days of Candy\" is one of the most beautifully written and arranged songs you'll hear all year. With an almost Brian Wilson-meets-10CC sound, this song aches and creaks like an old love. It's like walking through a childhood home and seeing hints of the past in every corner. It's a truly breathtaking song, and one you won't soon forget.\n\nDepression Cherry is a triumph of mood and emotion. You don't need to know what Victoria LeGrand is singing to be moved by her. There's a certain solace in sad songs. I guess it's knowing that you're not the only one going through it. Depression Cherry is the voice in the abyss telling you you're not alone.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"The proclaimed future of modern pop has struck again, and this time it isn't the instant sensation that was \"Bleeding Love\" nor is it the inspirational ballad of \"Footprints In The Sand.\" Nope, instead she gives us some background music, which may sound in with the times, but comes off as little more than a smooth radio-friendly sap fest.\n\nMusically, you can tell from the review title that the new Mariah is clearly musical fan of the old Mariah. But the not-so deep point here is that it could basically be sung by pop goddess, which doesn't differentiate this song from the rest of the competition.\n\nSo if you love Leona, love modern music, love smooth pop\/R&B tunes, and love \"safe\" music, than welcome to the party. But it holds little more than background music for me, because it doesn't really doesn't try to be anything more. Like some countries in the Olympics, some are just satisfied with OK.

{"text":"Cyndi Lauper returns with her 13th studio album.  As you can clearly see from the album title, Cyndi has defiantly taken her musical career through every little \"detour\" that she could find.  For starters, she fronted the one-off rockabilly band called Blue Angel back in 1980 for just one album before she became a solo megastar and MTV darling with 1983's \"She's So Unusual.\"  Throughout her 35 year career, she has done it ALL by tackling nearly every single genre:  pop, rock, R & B, ballads, standards, electronica\/dance, Memphis soul, and now country.  If you present it to Cyndi, she will work it to her advantage and deliver the vocals to you 120%.  Even Madonna could NEVER pull this off.  :)\n\nCyndi brings back the 1950's and 1960's standards that made other musicians famous.  Plus, she brings a few of her OWN great souls for a few tracks:  Emmylou Harris, Willie Nelson, Alison Krauss, and Jewel.  On \"I Want To Be A Cowboy's Sweetheart\", Jewel yodels but doesn't sing any lyrics, which is completely unheard of on ANY Jewel album (however, she did get her musical start from yodeling with her father).\n\nEvery song on this record is all killer, no filler; Cyndi hasn't lost a SINGLE octave in her register 4 decades later, and she shows NO signs of slowing down anytime soon.  Key tracks are \"Funnel Of Love\", \"Misty Blue\", and the Patsy Cline mainstay, \"I Fall To Pieces.\"  So, put on your cowboy\/cowgirl hat and get ready to have fun with Cyndi Lauper once again!!  :)","classification":5,"fold":6}

'hard to handle' is hot and chugs. and 'good lovin' is great pigpen rock and roll. this song was never the same after pigpen was gone. then 'i'm a king bee' could be one of my favorite versions ever,, really smokin blues. as said already in the other reviews, the 'alligator > drums> alligator> caution> feedback> goodnight,, ending is killer, and is a fitting climax to the show.  but wait ,there's more, the bonus disc is crazy good and may be a cd you just can't get out of your player. the whole disc is awesome ! and a real treat that dave included this disc from the night before at the same venue.... so what more is there ,, thanks dave !","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"\"Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree,\" written by Irwin Levine and L. Russell Brown, is performed better than ever here by Dawn featuring Tony Orlando. Tony born (Michael Anthony Orlando Cassavitis) sings the lyrics to the song while Telma Hopkins, Joyce Vincent Wilson and her sister Pamela Vincent sing excellent backup vocals. The song is sung from the point of view of a man who spent three years in prison; and he wonders if his one true love will take him back now that he is free. It's all poignantly told in the lyrics of the song.\n\nThe melody is catchy, memorable and fairly upbeat even though the outcome doesn't come until the end of the song. It's amazing that such a great hit then still sounds excellent today. I highly recommend this tune.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I listen to a wide range of music, and often I don't realize that a particular song I enjoy isn't a modern release until I look up more information about it online.  I frequently heard John \"Cougar\" Mellencamp's \"Jack and Diane\" on a \"lite\" radio station in the 2000s, but always thought it was a recent release -- it wasn't until recently that I learned it actually came out in the early '80s.  This doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the song, however -- I enjoy older music more than most modern music, and '80s music especially.  And this particular song is a fun and thoughtful one, upbeat but with lyrics that anyone can appreciate.\n\nA mellower rock song with electric and acoustic guitars as the main instruments (the drums are more subdued up until the bridge), this song showcases the titular teens as the main characters -- two kids growing up in a small town in America's heartland, entertaining dreams of the future and enjoying each other's company.  Even as they make big plans for the future, the chorus and the bridge counsel them to hang onto their youth as long as they can, because everyone grows up eventually, and there's no returning to the days of your youth.  After all \"life goes on, long after the thrill of living is done.\"\n\nWhether or not you agree with that sentiment (there's still the old adages of \"age is only a number\" and \"growing old is mandatory, growing up is optional,\" after all), this is still a powerful song, sort of a grown-up version of Kenny Loggins' \"Return to Pooh Corner.\"  While the singer of the former longs for a return to the days of childhood, John Mellencamp seems content to reminisce on the teenage years, and accepts that they won't come back and it's best to enjoy them as long as you can.\n\nA very enjoyable rock number, one that transcends its era and is timely even to modern audiences.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Interestingly enough,it was colorful artwork on the cover of St. Lucia's first full length album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/When-The-Night\/dp\/B00EMAGI28\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">When The Night<\/a>&nbsp;that attracted me to listening to it in the first place. One of the chief topics between myself and online friend of a decade Henrique Hopkins is how much the mid 80's electronic production ethic is the base of contemporary pop music in the 2010's. Jean-Philip Grobler,the real name of this artist,understands that part of the synth pop of a few decades past was actually built on song craft and rhythm more than a mere production style. And as if that wasn't projected enough on his previous album,it goes to the next level on this one.\n\n\"Do You Remember\" begins the album with a dense sound that manages to be both airy and industrial. \"Home\" is one of my favorite numbers here with it's percussive rhythm and brittle synth bass. \"Dancing On Glass\" slows down the tempo and maintains that mechanical electronic bass line. \"Physical\" is a pulsing techno styled number while \"Game 4 You\" is a beautifully crafted uptempo dance-pop number. \"The Winds Of Change\" and \"Love Somebody\" are both stripped down numbers-the former a more uptempo number and the latter a ballad. \"Rescue Me\" is a dramatically orchestrated house\/disco number while \"Stay\" brings in the South African flavor of Grobler's country of birth while the slamming synth rocker of \"Help Me Run Away\" and the dramatic ballad \"Always\" conclude the album.\n\nSt. Lucia's sound seems to always have a certain bigness about it. But he really bumps up the rhythm in a huge way on this album. All of the songs here are based squarely in the mid\/late 80's dance-techno-club-house sound where everything has a metallic cling and clang about it. His compositions are still extremely strong. And the arrangements add a vital thickness that makes the album so fully realized. He actually explores different aspects of the retro 80's sound on this album as well-including some numbers that are more minimalist and dealing with more percussive polyrhythms as well. As far as St. Lucia's artistic future? Let's just say this release is really heightening my expectations to what he's going to come up with if he keeps pursuing this percussive song craft based sound.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Third single \"Read My Mind\" is quite good and another of the releatively few highlights.\n\nThe title track is much better in the \"Sawdust\" version - somehow the great melody is lost in this upbeat version.

{"text":"With \"HIGHER TRUTH\" Chris Cornell Ventures Into Different Territory With Overwhelming Beautiful Results!!!  This Is, To Date, His Solo Masterpiece!\n\nWhile Chris Cornell (Known As The 90's God Of Grunge) Could Easily Have Sat Back On His Heels, He Is Quite Frequently Reinventing Himself...With Soundgarden, Temple Of The Dog, Audioslave And Solo Releases...\n\nIt Doesn't Always Work Out Well For The Musician When They Switch Gears.  However, Chris Cornell Manages To Incorporate New Sounds And  Instrumentation So His Fanbase Not Only Doesn't Desert Him, But Broadens!!  I, Myself, First Got Interested When I Heard About Audioslave Being The First U.S. Band To Perform In Cuba.  I'm Not Cuban, But Was Very Intrigued, Purchased A Used DVD On Amazon (Priced Very Attractively; I Wasn't Sure How I'd Feel About It) With Concert & Documentary.  Upon Watching, I Grew More Impressed And Interested.  The Documentary Was As Terrific As The Concert!  These Are Very Talented, Creative Artists & Intelligent, Respectful Men.  Watching Them Interact With The Cuban People Was An Education In Itself.  In Audioslave, Chris \"Rocks\" More (I Have \"Revelations\"; In Particular, Song \"Original Fire\") & Tom Morello (Rage Against The Machine) Tones Down The Rage & Rap...Which I Felt Worked To Both Their Advantages...\n\nBut, Chris Seemingly Likes To \"Change It Up\" From Time To Time.  He Never Stagnates!!  I Also Very Much Enjoy His Solo \"Euphoria Morning\", Wherein He Covers More Downbeat Serious Matters.  \"HIGHER TRUTH\" Lightens Things Up A Bit.  Every Song On It Is A Winner!!  I Caught The Music Video For The First Single: \"Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart\" And Was Sold Immediately!!  With \"HIGHER TRUTH\", Chris Cornell Proves Once & For All That It Certainly Is Possible And Viable For An Artist To Not Only Evolve But Even Top Themselves!! The Mantle 'God Of Grunge' Can Be Replaced With Chris Cornell Being The Voice Of His Generation's Neil Young, (Which I Do Mean As High Praise)!  And, Now To \"Toy\" With My Brain Will Be Figuring Out Who I'd Consider To Be The 'Neil Young' For My Own Generation (Somewhere Between The Two!!)  Hmmmmm.....","classification":5,"fold":6}

RTL has the best of early thrash\/speed metal but it also has some progressive influences that would show more on their next 2 releases. Ride the Lightning has the perfect mix and it's a classic. The band matured also from their previous both musically and lyrically, it's a but darker than their first album. It's also their first album to feature Cliff Burton on bass in every track, replaced Ron McGovney which he was the original bassist. Dave Mustaine was fired in 1983 and formed Megadeth, former Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammet replaced him and RTL is their first to feature him on guitar. The band gets their line up together here. All of the songs are great but Creeping Death is my personal favorite.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I wasn't really a fan of Tame Impala before this album. I listened to their previous albums and though I agree they are great classics in their own rights, their style wasn't for me. Then one day a friend of mine showed me their song 'Cause I'm A Man'. I was impressed. But it wasn't until I heard their song 'Let It Happen' that they had my full attention. It was one of the most epic and catchy electronic rock songs I've heard in recent years. So I read up on the mastermind behind the band Kevin Parker and his comments regarding this album. I was especially intrigued by the fact that it was basically abandoning the psychedelic rock nature or their previous efforts in favor of more synths and electronic aspects. Then behold the song 'Eventually' was released. Probably one of the greatest songs of all time. But still, leading up to the albums eventual release I almost forgot about the album coming out. But once again the week the album came out there was my friend again reminding me of the album and telling me how great it was all around. So I gave it a preview listen online and liked it. I also couldn't help but to see that other reviewers were calling it another classic breakup record. I love breakup albums the most. So I went and purchased the album and gave it a good few listens and I'm glad I did. Here is a track by track review of this amazing musical journey.\n\n1. Let It Happen: As I said, this is an epic synth dance disco rock song. The main synth riff is so urgent and infectious. In fact this entire song has a feeling of urgency as if one was being chased by bad guys throughout a maze like dance floor. At nearly 8 minutes it has more replay value than most 3 minute songs I've heard recently. There is just a bit guitar in here so don't worry if you were concerned that there would be no guitar at all. The final half of the song gets almost robotic in the vein of Daft Punk perfectly. This is also one of my new workout playlist tracks for the gym! Amazing song. 10\/10\n2. Nangs: This is a short cut. At first I thought it was going to be an interlude but its just a quick song. It's very trippy and layered with repeated vocals throughout. There's something soothing about it that makes me wish it lasted longer. Still very dreamlike. 9\/10\n3. The Moment: Another upbeat disco rock track. The repeated synth riff is simple and genius. There are atmospheric sounds faintly in the background that seem like faint orchestrated parts. Kevin sings in a relaxed voice throughout with infectious wit. The lyrics are very nice too. There is also an interesting synth solo that sounds exotic. 9.5\/10\n4. Yes I'm Changing: Things slow down for this very emotional and masterfully executed ballad. This is probably Kevins best vocal performance yet. I never thought he could sing like this. This should be a single. The lyrics are very reflecting. The production really makes you get lost in the soundscape. The final minute change tone to somewhat gothic keyboards ending the song in a hauntingly beautiful manner. A perfect song. 11\/10\n5. Eventually: Another perfect song. As I said earlier this is one of the best songs of all time in my opinion. It's a break up song, but from the point of view of the person doing the breaking up. The harsh but tuneful synth riff throughout is tragic and gorgeous. There are sudden stops throughout that just work so well. The vocals of course are emotional and almost remorseful to the lyrics. Its a sad song for a break up. I suggest you not listen to it during a bad break up. Still a masterpiece of a song. The final part of the song features this synth riff that just leaves me in near tears each time no matter my mood. I'm surprised this hasn't become a mega hit(yet) as it's also the catchiest song on an album full of catchy tracks. A beautiful emotional tour de force track that I would call the Song Of The Year. 11\/10\n6. Gossip: The synth of this song sounds like what its title suggest. It's as if the sounds are gossiping to each other. Very clever short interlude. 9\/10\n7. The Less I Know The Better: This one features more of the disco rock style. The guitars are back again with a funky groove throughout along with Kevins fun vocals despite the tone of the lyrics. The final verse of the song sounds like it should've been a chorus for the song its so playful and sad. A great unconventional possible hit! 9.5\/10\n8. Past Life: This is just amazing. The verses are spoken word and tell such a beautiful story about a past love. The chorus is sung in heavenly manner. Though at first some might be off put by the effect put on Kevins voice during the verses it actually feels like it couldn't work without it once you get used to the song. Very dreamy and heartbreaking yet it ends on a positive note. 10\/10\n9. Disciples: Another really short song. Not an interlude. Just a quick and awesome song. Its a nice fast song and I understand why its so short, but I wouldn't mind if it was twice as long either. Oh well that's what the replay button is for! 9\/10\n10. 'Cause I'm A Man: This is the closest thing to the psychedelic style but also in tune with the rest of the album. It's a very relaxing and empowering song. I was impressed but it's not my favorite on the album. Maybe it'll be yours though. 8.5\/10\n11. Reality In Motion: I like the laid back playful tone of Kevins singing again on this song. He makes it seem so effortless. It's a real head bobbing song. Of course like most of the songs it changes style a bit toward the end. There's even a slight guitar near the finale. Very nice. 9\/10\n12. Love\/Paranoia: Wow. Can this guy do no wrong? Just as the title suggest this one is full of love and paranoia in its sound and lyrics. It also a slight R&B feel that is pulled off almost too nicely. Very emotional too. Less than 30 seconds to the end it gets a so good with guitars and orchestration that I wish it lasted much longer. Dare I say it? Another perfect song. 10\/10\n13. New Person, Same Old Mistakes: The album began epic and fast. It ends epic and somewhat slow, in a good way. This song just has such a classy vibe to it. Everything about this song is smooth from the production to the style of the singing. This sounds like the perfect song to listen to while walking down a cityscape while wearing your best suit or dress with your head held up high. It's a very mysterious song as well. A great way to close this emotional album. 10\/10\n\nSo this album was a pleasant surprise and a nice treat. Very few times are full albums so consistent. This was epic and full of genius but at the same time very catchy and accessible. Something that is very rare to find in music nowadays. It is also the best all out break up album for me. But don't get me wrong, even if you're happily in a relationship or happily single you'd appreciate the beauty and sound of this. It's hard to fully explain just how magnificent and near perfect this album is. Like I said, I wasn't a fan before this album. Hopefully in further released the band explores more of this sound or maybe another. I'm sure Kevin is a class act with whatever style of music he tries to make. You will dance to this. You will relax to this. You might even cry to this. Don't be ashamed if you do! This is a very satisfying and smooth headphone album of heartbreak. Close your eyes. Let the music take you to abstract places in your mind. I seriously think this is a candidate for the Album Of The Year. It would be a criminal injustice if it wasn't even nominated at the Grammys. (Future people was I right or wrong?) If you liked their old albums but have an open mind for new sounds then you might like this or maybe not. If you like good electronic rock then you'll love this. I suggest you listen to it online first and if you like it then buy it. But be warned, once you get into this album, you'll never get tired of it!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"\"This is the start of something good, don't you agree?\" croons 26-year-old Gavin Degraw at the start of \"Follow Through\", the opening track of his debut album, CHARIOT, which has thus far peaked at #8 on Billboard's Heatseeker chart.  While a modest success saleswise as of yet, a thorough listen to the album proves the undeniable fact that this artist and album are destined for bigger, better places.\nDegraw has been at this for quite some time, despite having recently released his debut album.  A native of Manhattan, he has been an integral part of New York's music scene for a while now.  His music being unique yet comfortably familiar, hometown fans have come in droves to see his local shows.\nHis individuality shines throughout CHARIOT.  While at first glance one might think they could lump him with other successful male singer\/songwriters of lately who shouldn't even be being generalized in the first place such as Jason Mraz, John Mayer, Jack Johnson and, most recently, Josh Kelley, Degraw separates himself immediately from them with his smorgasbord of veering song structures, uniquely quirky lyrics and signature voice.  It also helps that his album isn't produced by John Alagia and that his name does not begin with J.\nIn the oddball \"Chemical Party\" he gives you a bird's eye view of what it is to be \"too high to see the point\", while the lead single \"Follow Through\" is a catchy tale of mutual sincerity in what could be the start of a rewarding relationship. \"I Don't Have to Be\", the set's easy highlight, is an ode to individuality.\n\"All I have to do\/Is think of me and I have peace in mind\/I'm tired of lookin' round rooms\/Wondering what I've got to do\/Or who I'm supposed to be\/I don't want to be anything other than me.\"\nOne song with particular hit potential is the endearing \"(Nice To Meet You) Anyway\", which could be considered an optimistic follow-up to the situation presented earlier in \"Follow Through\", which did not work out in the scheme of things, resulting in his finding a more nurturing, special relationship.  Also, in \"Over-Rated\", the uplifting finish to CHARIOT, Gavin tells his companion that, because of her, he now sees the stuff of life to be materialistic and, as it turns out, not so important.\nOther definite highlights include \"Belief\", a stream-of-conscious tune that features Degraw's soaring vocals at its conclusion, and the album's title track, which is delightful to the ears and cannot help but bring a smile or even perhaps a chuckle to the listener.\n\"Your favorite fruit is chocolate-covered cherries\/And seedless watermelon\/Nothing from the ground is good enough\/Body Rise\/Look what's over me\/Oh chariot\/Your golden waves\/Are walking down\/Upon this face\/Oh chariot\/I'm singing out loud\".\nHopefully Gavin will break into mainstream success similar to Jason Mraz, who did so quite a while after his debut album was released.  With an excellent album, a strong local fan base and constant self-promotion, all the right things seem in place for fate to its course. One thing is for sure: This is definitely the start of something good.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Life runs away forever\nTo never return back\nYou won't be able to predict\nWhat's waiting for tomorrow\n\nThese strong and very emotional melodies capture the soul from the first moments. You are not able to go away without continuing to hear this incredible music. Heidi Breyer returns with a new unbelievably wonderful 3rd project \"Beyond the Turning\".\n\nIt reminds us that life is a long road and invites us to move along on this exciting journey.\n\nWhat is the first impression of the new album of Heidi Breyer? Her piano music is filled with warmth and sincerity. These melodies are born from the bottom of the artist's heart. Their cordiality and easiness thrill the listener's heart.\n\nBut the emotional impact is not the only memorable feature of \"Beyond the Turning\". The music of Heidi Breyer is perfectly composed and arranged. Her newest project was produced by renowned sound engineer Corin Nelsen. The result of his work is the refined sound of the \"Beyond the Turning\".\n\nThe masters of acoustic instruments such as David Cullen (electric guitar), Eugene Friesen (cello), Charlie Bisharat (violin), Michael Manring (fretless bass) along with many other brilliant performers including tremendous ethnic vocals by Samite help to create the unique atmosphere of Heidi Breyer's project and achieve depths of emotional experiences.\n\nThe releasing of \"Beyond the Turning\" is undoubtedly a bright event of this year. Heidi Breyer continues to create and each listener is able to reach the harmonious and creative state of his soul and mind listening to her astonishing and vibrant new album.\n\nListen to the \"Beyond the Turning\" and sense what the music of the new epoch is...","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"From the sample, I had high expectations of the song but hearing the full version was not a great experience. Overall, when I listen to a slow song one thing I don't have is patience. So in order to circumvent this desire of mine to skip it in my mp3 player it must have several key elements to stop me from pushing that button. The first is innovative lyrics, then a soul that resonates, and a story in the sound (and I don't mean musicals). The song's lyrics are not impressive. They are somewhat repetitive and lack imagery and metaphors that make it stand out or relate to me. The soul in the song is...quiet. She has a lovely voice but because the song's lyrics lack power, her voice is underutilized and they make me think of...a calm stream in the mountains. Very lovely, but no something that will keep your interest for long unless you want to meditate. And then comes the story of the sound. This is where it gets tricky. The story of the sound only has two arcs. Most great songs have three places in the song that will keep you hooked. The climax of the song is the middle part after the introduction that will pull the song and finally cement it into your brain. The climax of this song started great but ended prematurely with more soothing tones that reminded me of the introduction of the song. I wish the best for this artist, but would suggest more variety and structure within the music.","classification":2,"fold":6}

So rather trying to do what a younger generation wants from her music, she is going back to the basics with her music. Her latest song Whole Damn Year from her upcoming album The London Sessions just doesn't ignite the way she had struggled in songs and in pain before. I really didn't find this song to ignite the fire she had shown before in her music. It just a little weaker from the heart, in the way she had done it before in her ballads like Take Me As I Am and Not Goin' Cry.

It's made Brian Rawling and Mark Taylor far more received now with their rumbling dance songs on her album and others. Runaway, Believe, All or Nothing and the other offerings are quite different. The least favorite song I don't care too much is \"Taking Back My Heart.\"  It kind of drags a bit and doesn't fit well into the album.  I like Taxi Taxi as well.  Another song that stands out is her dance version of her '87 song \"We All Sleep Alone.\"  It takes a more disco direction this time as opposed to the Bon Jovi-based power ballad sound of before, and it has me dancing to it every time!

This follows the club hit \"I'm a fire\" which topped Billboard's Hot dance club play charts (her 13th #1 there), in the process making her the only artist ever to have topped those charts in every decade from the seventies to date.\n\nWhile that effort was vintage Summer (very retro cool), \"Stamp your feet\" is very different, much more contemporary sounding; a player's anthem with a slight Hip hop\/Pop\/Dance feel (thankfully without a rapper in sight), stomping beats, electronic flourishes, and an incredibly catchy sing-a-long cheerleader-style chant and chorus. The lyrics (especially the free-form verbose verses) are fun, yet inspirational, urging on the down-and-out in life to get back up and into the game and win, using an athlete\/sportsman as a metaphor.\n\nAs ever, Summer shines vocally, (there's some slight vocoder effects) singing mainly in a lower register. The potential for this song is enormous, and if there's any justice, it should be a massive hit!\n\nCo-written by Summer with some young songwriters Greg Kurstin (Lily Allen, Kylie Minogue, P!nk) and Danielle Brisebois (Natasha Bedingfield, New Radicals, Kelly Clarkson), this is just one of the different colours (or sounds) Summer promises her new CD will contain, and with the two teasers off the album being this great, I can't wait to get my full box of \"Crayons\".\n\nP.S. er, Kayode, you'll have to download this for now... :-)","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"This is a decent mp3 set of various works by Tchaikovsky, heavy on works for orchestra. The best parts here are the less frequently heard works, such as the Orchestral Suites 2 & 4, the Piano Trio in A minor, The Seasons, the Danish Festival Overture and others. The version of the Manfred Symphony is really good, and it has been for a long time one of my favorite lesser known Tchaikovsky works. However, on the down side, the more familiar pieces in this set just do not seem to be very good performances. The numbered symphonies all sound bland and lifeless.(BTW-where is the Symphony No. 3, the Polish? You can't put in every symphony, including the Manfred, and leave out one of the earlier ones.) The piano and violin concertos also sound barely decent. The ballets are a strange mixture. You get the complete Nutcracker, (though split up over several tracks in a very frustrating way) seven or eight pieces from Swan Lake, and a single excerpt from Sleeping Beauty. What's up with that? The suite from each one would have sufficed, if that's how they were going to do it. The chamber pieces were decent, though it would have been nice to see the sextet version of Souvenier de Florence instead of the string orchestra version. And the piano pieces were barely noticed.\n  Overall, if you are a newbie to Tchaikovsky and aren't too picky on the quality of the performances, you might want to try this out. At 99 cents it's not terrible. But if not, then just cherry pick this set for the Manfred and the Orchestral Suites. Plus the Piano Trio. -------------PEACE","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"I was kind of surprise to log on here and see so many negative reviews posted for \"Educated Horses\"? I think this is one of Zombie's best albums, pushing his music into new directions, while still holding onto the sound that made him famous. What I like best about \"Educated Horses\" is that Zombie experiments with his sound, and while he does make his music more accessible, it's still distinctive Rob Zombie.\n\nLike his previous albums, when you pop on a Zombie disk, it's like popping in a grindhouse movie, and you know you're in for a roller coaster ride. From the haunting beat of \"Sawdust in the Blood\" and the driving guitar of \"American Witch\", Zombie sets the tone for the whole album. \"Foxy, Foxy\" is just a fun rock tune with an instant hook to the chorus. I like the sitar found on \"17 Year Locust\" as it adds a new flavor to the Zombie mix, and \"Let it All Bleed Out\" is a classic and could've been lifted right off of \"Hillbilly Deluxe\".\n\nEach of the songs is chock full of great guitar work, and some pretty funky grooves. I guess \"heavy metal\" purists may dislike this disk, and if you're hoping for an album which sounds exactly like Rob Zombie circa 1998, you may be disappointed. But for me, I love seeing Zombie's change and growth as an artist.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"This album contains four major country hits but only one of them made it on to the American version of A collection of hits. In Europe, an expanded 13-track collection was released adding the other three but this version is long out of print. So this album, apart from being a high quality original album, also served as hits volume 2 until the more comprehensive Definitive Collection was released.\n\nThe one track that made it onto the American hits collection is Where've you been, which has become Kathy's signature song. However, in this particular song it is the lyrics that people seem to love - they relate to the sentiments expressed. The other hits were all upbeat, catchy songs - Come from the heart, Burning old memories and She came from Fort Worth Texas.\n\nOf the other songs, my favorite is Hills of Alabam. No surprise, really, as this was written and originally recorded by my favorite bluegrass singer, Claire Lynch, who adds backing vocals. Claire's own version can be found on an untitled album by the Front porch string band, of which she was lead singer. The title track is also excellent, as are Here's hoping, True north, Love chooses you and I'll take care of you.\n\nWhile I slightly prefer her two previous albums (Walk the way the wind blows, Untasted honey), there isn't much to choose between the three and those two are better represented on that hits collection. So if you already have that, this should be the next Kathy Mattea album on your shopping list.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"All my life I've gone back and forth regarding which band I loved the most - Basie for his swinging blues or Ellington for his sophisticated compositions. This album only confuses me all the more, but also delights me.\n\nThe selections are superb, but the arrangements on this album tend to underscore Ellington's bands strengths. At least to my ears it sounds that way. But I am not complaining because the musicianship is mind boggling.\n\nI am reviewing the CD version of this album, which contains the original eight tracks. The product page for the CD - at the time of this review - does not have sound samples. For those I recommend that you go to the page for the MP3 version of the album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/First-Time-The-Count-Meets-The-Duke\/dp\/B0013DCCS6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">First Time! The Count Meets The Duke<\/a>, which not only contains representative sound samples for the original eight tracks, but an additional seven bonus tracks that were released with the reissue of this album. Those sound samples will convey more information in a few seconds of sound snippets than I can possibly describe in words. Since reviews are crosslinked between both formats you may already be on the MP3 version's page.\n\nAlthough I will not attempt to describe the music, I will point out some of the reasons I love this album. First is the piano duets that feature both the Duke and the Count. Their styles are so radically different that hearing them together is a study in contrasts that perfectly complement one another. If ever there was a musician definition of Yin and Yan this is it.\n\nAs a drummer I enjoyed picking out the contrasts between Sam Woodyard whose style made innovative use of pitch as well as rhythm, and Sonny Payne who knew how to set up each phrase in a composition and swing the band like crazy. However, as a musician, the melodic and harmonic complexities of each arrangement and the solos were a joy and a learning experience.\n\nHere is who marched into Columbia's 30th Street Studio in NYC on July 6, 1961 and made this all possible:\n\nBRASS SECTION\nTrumpet:  Cat Anderson, Willie Cook, Eddie Mullens, Ray Nance, Sonny Cohn, Lennie Johnson, Thad Jones and Snooky Young.\n\nTrombone: Juan Tizol, Louis Blackburn, Lawrence Brown, Henry Coker, Quentin Jackson and Benny Powell.\n\nREEDS AND WIND SECTION (some personnel double on instruments and will be repeated  under more than one category)\n\nClarinet: Jimmy Hamilton, Russell Procope and Marshall Royal\nAlto Sax: Johnny Hodges, Russell Procope, Marshall Royal and Frank Wess\nTenor Sax: Jimmy Hamilton, Frank Wess, Paul Gonsalves, Frank Foster and Budd Johnson\nBaritone Sax: Harry Carney and Charlie Fowlkes\nFlute: Frank Wess\n\nRHYTHM SECTION\nPiano: Duke Ellington and Count Basie\nGuitar: Freddie Green\nBass: Aaron Bell and Eddie Jones\nDrums: Sam Woodyard and Sonny Payne\n\nIf you love Ellington, Basie or both this is an album to own. I recommend the MP3 version because of the seven bonus tracks, but either way this is a slice of history that we can all be thankful that it happened.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Lil Wayne has always had a problem of proving himself as \"best rapper alive\". Sure he can bust a dope freestyle now and then but he has never made a classic album. Lights Out, The Carter and Carter II were good but they were far from classics. If you are going to call yourself the greatest the least you can do is make a great album. The Carter II was great lyrically(for the most part) but the production was suspect. The production on this album is better than the production on Carter II but lyrically its not better than Carter II. There are some good songs to be found on here: A Milli feat Corey Gunz is a banger. 3Peat, Let The Beat Build, Tie My Hands(feat Robin Thicke) are passable. Mr Carter feat Jay-z is pretty good and Dr Carter is probably the most creative track that Wayne has ever made. Comfortable feat Babyface(which samples the ending of Alicia Keys' You Dont Know My Name) is a good track for the ladies. Despite these tracks, the album is weaighed down heavily with garbage tracks. P**** Monster, Phone Home(nice beat but WTF???) and the deadly dull Shoot Me Down are prime examples of what I'm talking about. The ringtone classic Lollipop(feat Static Major RIP) should have been slammed in the trash. Fabolous FLOORS Lil Wayne and Juelz Santana on You Aint Got Nothin. Mrs Officer is a waste of Bobby Valentino's talent and our time and probably has the dumbest chorus on the album(weeoooweeweeoooweeeoooweee?). La La feat Busta Rhymes and Brisco sucks point blank period.  Got Money feat T-Pain is a failed club banger and Dontgetit is ruined by Wayne speaking his mind on why he hates Al Sharpton. Now we all know that Al Sharpton is a person of questionable character(unless you're sheep) but Wayne isn't bright enough to defend his position so he ends up sounding stupid as hell. At any rate if this was the album that was supposed to prove that he was the greatest then that remains to be seen. The production for the most part is not bad but sometimes Wayne's rhymes were either mediocre and sometimes he sounded like he didn't even finish his punchlines. Wayne should get rid of the ego and just concentrate on making a quality album because this one is far from his true potential.","classification":3,"fold":6}

It's a challenge for the contestants to sing covers yet show some uniqueness.  She certainly did that here--I've heard the original but didn't purchase it.  I don't think it was done anywhere near as well as Jena did it--whether one likes the slowed down version or not, her voice quality was far better than Radiohead's.  Unfortunately, at the end of the competition, American Idol (as in most viewer voted game shows) becomes more a contest between\/among the voters rather than between\/among the performers.  IMHO Jena outshined all the other contestants due to her creative style, uniqueness, and voice quality--though Caleb shined in stage presence.  A lot depends on the weights a voter has on the various aspects of performances--and how easily\/early voters commit to a particular performer--ignoring later differences at times.

{"text":"If you like the early first 3 albums by Santana, this is definitely the 2 CD set to get--the 1st album is remastered very clearly, the jam sessions are very clear, it shows you what the early band was like without Mike Shrieve as drummer just before it recorded the 1st album. You really can tell the difference--Mike Shrieve was and still is a supurb drummer and made Santana rock out.  The booklet included with this is great with alot of comments from Greg Rolie, the original keyboardist and singer.  The whole Woodstock concert is here--remastered perfectly and very clear with an added unknown song at the end of the set.  The practice sessions before the actual album recording were great-extended songs --sounds great!!!  I highly recommend this 2 CD set for any Santana fan or collector--it is definitely worth it.  Rock on with sixties rock--SF style!!!!!!!!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Little Caesar released their debut album in 1990. Like many bands of the time, Little Caesar played a radio friendly form of melodic hard rock. These guys sure didn't look the part of a melodic rock band, instead, looking more like bandmates of Slayer or Megadeth.\n\nWhile this album didn't blow my mind in the least, it did have some pretty cool tracks throughout. I never really was a big fan of the band, but I thought I'd give this baby another listen just to be sure. These guys had nothing wrong with them, but they just failed to deliver any songs that made me go WOW! It's completely acceptable to make decent records like Little Caesar did, however, for my money they weren't one of the better bands of the time. I did like songs like \"Drive It Home,\" \"Midtown,\" \"Cajun Panther\" and \"I Wish It Would Rain.\"\n\nDefinitely check these guys out if you like melodic hard rock from the early-90s, but just don't expect anything mind-blowing. These guys are a perfectly decent band in their own right, just aren't one of my favorites.","classification":4,"fold":6}

This first single from the upcoming \"How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful\" album finds Florence in the position of strongly questioning a lover who is noncommittal.  \"To let me dangle\/at a cruel angle\" and \"you do so much damage\/how do you manage\" are a few lyrics of heartache, and rage, and questioning as Florence confronts the loss of her dream. To match the powerful vocals, the band shares expert instrumentation, with a spotlight on hungry, aggressive guitar that meets, and raises the intensity of Florence's solid delivery.  \"What Kind Of Man\" provides an illuminating and satisfying step in the evolution of Florence + The Machine's catalog of work.  I highly recommend adding \"What Kind Of Man\" to your music library.\n\nRob.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Many people thought that Bob Dylan's album Christmas in the Heart must have been some kind of sick holiday joke back in 2009, but I think it has held up well in the years since. This is one of the more offbeat, but finest holiday albums released in the past 20 to 25 years. And as the years (and Christmases) go by, it seems more and more that this is the Christmas seed from which all of Dylan's recent \"great American songbook\" albums have sprung from. This album was meant to echo the classic, old-time Xmas songs of way back when. Like Sinatra, Doris Day, Bing Crosby, Burl Ives and company. The arrangements and production values reflect that. Yes, Bob's voice is ragged, creakly, sandpapery and rough, but you get a feeling that he puts new life into these songs which can seem tired at best in the hands of another singer. And you feel that he truly believes the sentiments expressed in these songs, something very rare in today's Xmas albums. Another trick of the trade that Bob (and perhaps everybody) knows: just like the late great Leonard Cohen, Bob uses sweet female voices to be the sugar on his sometimes hard to get vocals. The backup singers here remind me of the Andrews Sisters. The point is that this album works.\n  Highlights include Here Comes Santa Claus, I'll Be Home for Christmas, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, The Christmas Song and more. I'd never heard the song Christmas Island before, but now I have to rank it among my favorite Xmas songs. It's cute and kitschy. This album is recommended for Dylan fans, Xmas album nuts, and those who grow a bit tired of the holiday fare on Lite FM. It's also a wonderful primer for those who wish to get into (or try to appreciate) Dylan's more recent standards albums, Shadows in the Night, Fallen Angels and Triplicate. All in all a nice recommendation. Happy (very early) Holidays!------------------------------PEACE\nBTW-The one bad song was Must Be Santa. Dylan doing a polka??!!","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Laura Veirs last album was the child friendly traditional songs of \"Tumble Bee\" which had it moments but was aimed at a very specific audience. In one sense then \"Warp and Weft\" is her first proper album since the summer pastures of 2009's wonderful \"July Flame\". If you don't own, or have yet to hear the title track or \"Make something good\" the lovely duet with My Morning Jacket's Jim James then seek medical help. This is the Portland's singers ninth album and one of her best. James is back guesting on the album. as are the two chanteuses Neko Case and K D Lang plus fellow North Westerners the Decemberists. The most immediate impression of this album is that its a much less laid back affair than \"July Flame\". Electric guitars and punchy solos punctuate many of the songs and there is even a slice of Alice Coltrane style jazz in \"White Cherry\" which has the considerable merit of being highly listenable. It's mantra, of \"Abundant life, that's this life.\" closes an album of true wonders.\n\nBack at the beginning is the acoustic \"Sun Spot\" with Neko Case making an impressive guest appearance. It does reprise some \"July Flame\" sounds and is a sterling start with Veirs vocal mixing soft and grit, combined with great electric guitar backing and strings that take it out with a bang. The next song \"America\" is essentially a rock song with a grungy bass. It is much harder fare than Veirs usual template and enters the heated debate on gun control when she observes \"Everybody's packing heat in America \/ Training their barrels on the city streets of America\". The great storytelling of \"Dorothy of the Island\" is a real standout punctuated with a rocking guitar solo although the haunting \"Shape Shifter\" matches it with high emotion as Veirs sings about the approach of cold frost and winter. The welcoming title of \"Say Darlin Say\" betrays a jagged song with a edgy guitar motif, while \"That Alice\" is good old folk rock with a guitar solo straight out of the Crazy horse songbook. An Asian tinge impinges on the straightforward Americana of the stellar \"Sadako Folding Cranes,\". The songs beauty almost defies its terrible subject matter as Veirs has coined a ballad about Hiroshima bomb victim Sadako Sasaki that tracks the terror faced by this infant as \"She is blown out of the window\/She is two years old\/This is our cry, this is our prayer.\". The penultimate track \"Ten Bridges\" is more of the type of gentle folk lyricism that is Veirs calling card and offers a nice breathing space as the album draws to a close.\n\nVeirs has stated recently that \"this record is an exploration of extremes - deep, dark suffering and intense, compassionate love.\" It was recorded while she was pregnant and contains all those hopes and dark fears that respectively inspire and haunt prospective parents. It amounts to a record for which she should be immensely proud as it is by far her most satisfying album to date packed with expertly crafted songs for your listening pleasure.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"First time I was getting heavily into the music and especially instrumental approach of Jan Hammer was about a decade ago. A local DJ,now keyboardist of some note named Nigel had a local radio show and managed to interview him. He recommended I seek this album out. It was apparently Jan's first solo (no collaborative) release after departing from Mahavishnu Orchestra-though by no means his first album as a leader. He was leading a trio of himself,electric violinist Steve Kindler and percussionist David Earle Johnson. It was 1975,and he had a very set concept for this new project.\n\n  The \"first seven days\" represented in the title of course refers to the biblical concept of creation. Most of the time,two concepts are blended into one as \"Darkness\/Earth In Search Of A Sun\" for example starts very much like straight up cinematic orchestration and goes right for very intense progressive synth solos on the second half. \"Light\/Sun\",\"Oceans And Continents\" and \"Fourth Day: Plants And Trees\" start out as acoustic piano numbers and develop into electronic fusion melodic sounds-capes. \"The Animals\" is deep,bass synth heavy progressive Afro-Funk-full of Johnson's high energy percussive rhythms.\n\n  \"Sixth Day-The People\" and the closing \"The Seventh Day\" both showcase Kindler's European classic style violin playing while again broadening into electronic space fusion frontiers. This album showcases Jan Hammer's musical gift of being able to paint his broad instrumental brush strokes on a canvas capable of holding down both Hammer's strong melodic sense,as well as his ability to create tonal poems with musical sound. The overall effect of this album is a superb (and somewhat rare) joining of both European classic orchestration and Afrocentric melodic and rhythmic content. The sounds congeal,separate and split apart into their own musical worlds throughout this album. And it deserves the high reputation it apparently has among Jan Hammer aficionado's.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Some of the songs sounded close to prior material. This is very unique.\n\nIt is Deftones at their moody-beautiful best. A great listen and has more dimensions than the last 2. Even though people may not see it as  'heavy', its heavy in a different way. Chino's voice is clearer than ever in the clean parts, but just as rough when needed. There are less extremely distorted Guitar tracks, but there is plenty of heaviness.\n\nI like moody music. Love Deftones', liked 'Team Sleep' and 'Crosses' as well. This has more of a rub of those 2 projects, but it is definitely is a Deftones CD through and through.\n\nIf you don't like it on first listen, listen again. I cant see how anyone can give this less than a 4 rating on writing, production and sound quality alone. Its one of their best and definitely one of their more experimental discs. But that doesn't mean it isn't pure Deftones.\nBuy it. One of the best 2016 releases so far from anyone.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Exceptional. I say that because Kendrick Lamar is one of the few up and coming rap artists that maintains hip hop as just that - an art. This song, like ADHD has a very important message - a warning to the listener of the dangers of alcohol, all while making your head nod! The club ready beat might actually get this song some radio play, but the ever conscious lyrics keeps us listening and thinking about more than just usual sex, money and cars. This second single from Kendrick's first album on the label Aftermath shows us how he hasn't \"sold out\" after all, and might have even improved since Section. 80.\n\nKendrick is one of the best rappers out now, and is of the crew who I believe is the future of rap.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Because of this, what was once an incomplete concert can now be pieced together to bring us the whole show! Yippie!!! This release, (Dave's Picks 6) is just that. The Sound Quality is Very Good and the Band is playing like they used to in the early days, with some serious guts and exploratory jams. Highlights include 2 DARK STARS, 2 Mason's Children, and 2 LOVELIGHTS (one of which is 35 minutes long). Pig Pen is in fine form here and you get a heavy dose of him as he marches everyone into a obliviated frenzy. I would say for many reasons, that this a very signifcant release that does not fit the usual mold of many of it's predecessors. Two shows at-> the FOX Theatre St. Louis, MO 2\/2\/70, and The FILLMORE Auditorium San Francisco, CA 12\/20\/69. Because it is a limited number release of just 13,000 copies, this release will soon be a highly sought after commodity. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!! 5 STARS!!!!!

{"text":"After spending the past few years getting all the nu-metal trash thrown at me, it seems that that fad has finally waned down.  This new \"metal-core\" fad in metal today will most likely suffer the same fate, but for bands like Soilwork, this passing fad may find them mainstream success.  After the disappointing \"Figure Number Five\", Soilwork return with \"Stabbing the Drama\", which is a vast improvement, and while it may not harken back to the \"Natural Born Chaos\" or even \"Steelbath Suicide\" days, this album still manages to be a more than solid headbanger.  The title track features an incredibly catchy chorus, while \"One With the Flies\", \"Stalemate\", and \"If Possible\" are great as well.  However, there are times on \"Stabbing the Drama\" that it sounds too mainstream aimed, especially on \"Distance\".  Despite that, and many of the negative reviews featured here, \"Stabbing the Drama\" is an intelligent metal album, which is something the genre so desperately needs with all the Killswitch Engage's and Atreyu's running around today.  All in all, if you've never heard Soilwork before, check out \"Steelbath Suicide\" or \"Natural Born Chaos\", and then give \"Stabbing the Drama\" a stab.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"The last three concerts of the Monkees summer 1967 concert tour were professionally recorded, with the idea of assembling a live album from the tapes.  Also, two weeks before those concerts, a member of the Monkees touring crew recorded one of their concerts, probably for his own use.  As far as I know, these four concerts are the only recordings of Monkees concerts from the 1960s that exist.  Unfortunately, the exact same songs were played in the exact same order at all four shows.  Which is not to say that the concerts are exactly the same.  The Monkees make different mistakes at each of the concerts.  Sometimes they sing the wrong lyrics, sometimes they play the wrong notes.  And there are often technical problems with the microphones and instruments.  Probably the major difference other than the mistakes is in the ad libs that the Monkees say during the concerts.  They even occasionally ad lib a few lines from songs like \"Singin' in the Rain\", \"There's No Business Like Show Business\" and \"Act Naturally\".  So, is it worth owning copies of all four concerts?  Not really, unless you're an absolute Monkees fanatic.  Of course, I own this collection, so I guess you know where I stand.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"Michael Parks was a sort-of James Dean substitute in a one-season wonder on NBC in 1969. He leaves his news reporter job in San Francisco (how appropriate!) after a colleague kills himself. Riding his Harley, he rides in and out of other peoples' lives and seems to be a catalyst for resolving their issues, instead of his own. The closing theme to the show became the title song for this album, and both Parks and the music are better than they have a right to be. Parks has a quiet and rough quality to his voice-rather like his character-and it serves this collection of less-known and well-known standards, as well as the originals, well. He even tackles 'Melancholy Baby' and pulls it off. It doesn't hurt to have James Burton backing him up, along with other fine musicians. The arrangements and overall sound are dated, but entirely appropriate for the time in which this was recorded. If you recall that series-or if you just want something gently nostalgic, this album, along with the others Mr. Parks released, will satisfy.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"It did not take long for The Doobie Brothers to make their mark on the American music scene. Formed in San Jose, Ca. in 1970, The Doobies found themselves riding high on the Billboard Top Pop Singles Chart when in the fall of 1972 their debut release \"Listen To The Music\" leaped all the way to #11. Quite an accomplishment! Over the next few years, in the waning days of Top 40 radio on the AM dial, the hits just kept on comin' with memorable songs like \"Long Train Runnin'\", \"Black Water\" and \"China Grove\". Meanwhile, The Doobie Brothers were also making their mark on the FM side. The album-oriented rock (AOR) format was just gaining traction in the early to mid 70's and Doobie's tunes were prominently featured in that format as well. What I particularly enjoyed about The Doobie Brothers was that no two songs seemed to sound alike. This was a very innovative group that featured tight harmonies and superior musicianship. The group was plagued by constant personnel changes which made the fact that their music was so consistently good all the more remarkable.\n\nThen in 1975 Michael McDonald came aboard to replace Tom Johnston and lent his considerable talents to the group. But The Doobie Brothers had a lot of trouble coming up with another big hit. \"Takin' It To The Streets\" and \"It Keeps You Runnin'\" were great records but it seemed the public had lost some interest. In late 1978 the group released the album \"Minute By Minute\". This record was greeted with wild enthusiasm by the public. Not only did it reach #1 on the Billboard Albums chart, but it stayed there for five weeks. \"Minute By Minute\" also spawned the #1 single \"What A Fool Believes\" which in my opinion would rank among the best singles of the 1970's. What a fabulous tune!","classification":5,"fold":6}

It has a simplistic feel that matches that is very mellow and elequent. I like the song a whole lot, because it shows a more natural tone to Fergie's soulful voice, and what she does to make it worth while.

It was a mixtape joint that just blew up out of nowhere. That was like the summer anthem. Then you got Styles P on it. His verse was cut short for some reason. A lot of people felt like SP messed the song up. I disagree, his verse served it purpose.  And then you got two high energy song like \"MC Hammer \"and \"I'm Not a Star\". Yall know those songs will get hype whenever they come one. Yeah, Yeah he recycled the formula but thhe make it work!\n\n\"Freemason\" is another song I like on here. Ross basically trolled everybody with title Lol. Keep in mind this is everybody was running with the Jay Z Illuminati stuff. Me personally, I stay the away from all of that type off stuff. Back to the review, Ross did his thing, but Jay bodied this joint! His wordplay was crazy \"He without sin shall cast the first stone\/ So yall look in the mirror, Double-check your appearance\/ B****, I said I was amazing\/ Not that Im a Mason\/ Its amazing, that I made it through the maze that I was in\/ Lord forgive me, I never wouldve made it without sin\".\n\n\"Aston Martin Music\" is just one of those smooth radio joints. The song was so dope that Drake and Chrisette Michele had to make their versions of it! \"Tears of Joy\" is dope too. Cee-Lo did his thing on the hook. Its funny to hear Ross address the DJ Vlad situation.\" A punch in the face get you 300K\/ ask Vlad, Now he back to making minimum wage\/ another victim of my criminal ways\". S***, the punch basically made Vladtv what it is today Lol. I bet Vlad don't regret getting punched one bit Lol. Also check out \"Super High featuring Ne-Yo\" and All The Money In The World featuring Raphael Saadiq, which is one of Ross' most personal joints.\n\nNow lets into the bad. \"No. 1\" is wack! Everything about that song is wack. The lyrics are wack, the beat is wack and the hook is extremely wack. Am I the only one not feeling \"Live Fast, Die Young\" and \"Maybach Music III\"? There weren't necessarily wack, but its something about those two songs that I cant really get into. I really cant put my finger but oh well...Overall I really enjoy this album and I think its safe to say that Teflon don is the most accessible Rick Ross album.

{"text":"From the first time we were introduced to Michelle Williams as a solo artist it was obvious that she was a woman with passion for God and a testimony to tell.\n\nLast year she wowed us with IF WE HAD YOUR EYES, and this year she has us praising God and all He does for us with a new single SAY YES featuring her Destiny's Child family.\n\nThe message of SAY YES? \"When Jesus says yes nobody can say no.\" That is something that all people of faith can appreciated. \"I'm not worried about a thing,\" she sings, \"cause I know you are guiding me. Where you lead me I will go. I have no fear 'cause I know who's in control.\"\n\nMichelle uses this song that is sure to bring you to your feet to help remind you that what is meant for you is for you, regardless what others might say. \"There's no limit to what you can do,\" she sings, \"cause it all belongs to you. Yes, it all belongs to you. You're almighty and all powerful. It all belongs to you. Yes, it all belong to you.\"","classification":5,"fold":6}

But now I seem to realize that time has done this song *very* well and I'm able to appreciate it with open ears. The melody is actually really stellar and well-written.  I was too obsessed disliking the singer's voice (Shannon Hoon) to notice the melody back in 1992.  I look back and think Shannon Hoon's singing style was a little ahead of its time.  I wasn't prepared for it.  Now I find myself singing the line \"All I can say is that my life is pretty plain, you don't like my point of view you think that I'm insane!\" all the time!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"There definitely are several different styles of song in this album and some pieces are just beautiful.  I don't believe this is for the \"pop music\" minded but for a more mature ear that loves what world music offers.  You definitely get a sense of the Argentine influence in all the songs and all songs are sung in Spanish.  This is not an Argentine \"rock\" album.  Think of what you might hear when you walk along the old cafes at night and look for a place to drink a late night espresso or ... Most of the pieces are on the mellow side with a couple that are slightly more upbeat and modern.  If you like the Argentine flavor that you are familiar with in their tangos then you will appreciate this album as there is a bit in some and more than that in others.  Of all the free albums I consider this one amongst the very best in less than a handful of good ones. Great value!!!  Love it!

It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.

Klinger actually became my favorite character. I guess at that point I started paying more attention to it, and was also more forgiving of the relentless puns. some of those were so cringe-worthy that I would want to leave the room. I always thought the song was cool, but it wasn't until i learned later that it had words to it. after hearing it with vocals, I started paying more attention to the show itself. also whenever the instrumental played I could now feel the inate sadness behind it.

{"text":"hmmm well being a Roger Waters fans i always had my reservations about the previous Pink Fraud albums of the 80s... they sounded good, but so many extra hired hand writers to make them sound like Floyd... and while also a fan of Richard Wright, he appeared to be hired back more to make it look like Gilmour and Mason were ligit in using the Floyd name.  Finally on this album you can hear more of Wright's musical contributions... check out his solo albums sometime by the way, particularly his first.  So what do we have here ... mostly really non-songs, musical interludes and expansions.. reaching peak moments that are often quite wonderful but never coming to fruition as a song...  These are extra moments... the narrative music of movies perhaps without the hit songs... and the one at the end with words by Dave Gilmour's wife... i dunno doesn't quite work for me though i appreciate the Coda ending of the Floyd career thought behind it... \"all that matters is the music we made\" basically... but it didn't come from them...  So what do we have  a nice album of background music.. and that's okay... it works as that.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"I've been listening to this soundtrack for a few weeks now and I've come to the conclusion that...I like it.  Now, I have to admit that I've been a little disappointed with our biblical soundtracks lately.  I had high hopes for the \"Noah\" soundtrack composed by Clint Mansell but I felt that it was somewhat lacking.  As I mentioned in that review, I can't help to think of the great composers like Elmer Bernstein and Miklos Rozsa when it concerns biblical epics.  Alberto Iglesias is a new composer for me and I was excited to hear his musical interpretation of the exodus.  This composer may be new to me but he has quite the resume with 3 nominations for an Academy Award and a long list of Spanish film scores.  Iglesias has done an excellent job with this score.  He has sprinkled the score with chants\/voices, authentic instrumentation, and has crafted a musical style that fits the region\/time in which the story takes place.  There is a lot of choral voices in this score and they are blended into the music perfectly.  The action music is indeed epic and the choir highlights these intense scenes very well.  Some of the cues are slightly reminiscent of Zimmer's \"Gladiator\" score...such as track 3 \"Hittite Battle\".\n\nLike I mentioned before, I've been listening to this score for a couple of weeks now.  I've been taking it to work and playing it on my dock in the office, as well as, here at home.  Sometimes the music just blends into the background and I am no longer actively listening to it....but sometimes a piece will come on that demands your attention.  The standout tracks to me are #15 \"I Need a General\", #16 \"Exodus\", and #27 \"Into the Water\".  There was something about these particular cues that made my ears perk up.  \"I Need a General\" is a beautiful slow building piece that has a spiritual quality to it.  I haven't seen the movie but I assume something heavenly is happening here?  At any rate, this track is great and in my mind it paints a picture of some divine intervention.  \"Exodus\" follows and continues to build upon this with great success.  It's a great piece that doesn't bury the theme in noise.  \"Into the Water\" is also a building number that reaches it's peak at 3 minutes where the theme blooms into full orchestral greatness.  This one will give you goosebumps.  This is a great score.  It stylistically fits the movie, has traditional instrumentation that you'd expect for this film, and the choir\/voices give it that \"epic\" feel.  There are some great standout tracks here too.  So why don't I love it?  I think it is because there isn't enough \"divine\" in the score.  It's kind of hard to explain but at times I feel that something is missing.  Maybe this was the intention of the composer and sometimes film scores can be a little difficult to appreciate when taken out of context from the actual movie.  I haven't seen the movie but I'm sure the score does it justice.  There are some great moments here that really shine out and capture the story of the biblical epic and fans of film scores will definitely want this one in their collections.\n\nThe CD version is produced by Sony Classical.  There are 36 tracks on the disc and your getting about 1 hour and 19 minutes of music here.  The booklet contains some great photos from the film but unfortunately doesn't contain any composer\/director liner notes.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"First, the song, taken as a whole, is better than the available sample.\n\nThere are three distinct stylistic changes during \"Caribbean Sunset,\" a three-minute song.  The song begins with an African\/reggae flavor.  In this section, the percussions are very strong.  The lyrics, however, have uneven volume levels.  Additionally, they sound distant.  Although the lyrics are unintelligible, they combine with the instrumentals, and are a bit mesmerizing.  (I looked them up on line, and they were about a woman whose behavior confuses the singer.) The chorus begins the first electronic\/new age section, and includes some odd sound effects. Finally, the song ends with a new age passage that is very short and that cuts off very abruptly.\n\nThe song is strange, interesting and annoying.  The best thing about this product is the pretty cover, which is a strange commentary on music, isn't it?\n\nI downloaded it as a free promotion.  Simply put, the high and low points cancel each other out.  It's okay, so I've rated it as 3 stars.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"Prime Cuts: Love Grows Wild, Draw Me a Map, Fallin' for You\n\nCall it progressive bluegrass or acoustic Americana, Dierks Bentley has indeed taken a chance with this new disc \"Up on the Ridge.\"  Though he has built up a cachet of hits including 7 number i hits and 3 number 1 albums, few with his stature would take such a risky excursion by recording an album worth of bluegrass\/acoustic  entries.  Patty Loveless, Lorrie Morgan and Alan Jackson had taken such detours before in recording such side projects, but they were fraught with commercial disappointment at the chagrin of the money-hungry record executives.  Considering the fact that lead single and title track \"Up on the Ridge\" has already made headlines in the top 40 region of the country charts, looks like Bentley will be the exception to the rule.  This time round, Bentley has ditched long time friend and co-producer Brett Beavers in favour of former recording artist and songwriter Jon Randall Stewart to warm the co-producer chair.  And if you are a fan of old time bluegrass and wouldn't mind a contemporary slant, this disc is choked full of great tunes.  With Bentley co-writing only 5 cuts with new tunes coming from Nashville's top scribes including Shawn Camp, Paul Kennerley, John Scott Sherrill, Verlon Thompson and Suzi Ragsdale.  And up the bar on the standard of the songs, he has audaciously turned Bob Dylan's \"Senor (Tales of Yankee Power)\" and U2's \"Pride\" into bluegrass covers.\n\nOf note also is the line up of artists that are brought in for some grab of credibility and star power.  As if to win him some brownie points with bluegrass purists, Chris Tile and the Punch Brothers join Bentley on a sped up version of Dylan's \"Senor (Tales of Yankee Power)\" where Bentley goes around searching for his missing girl.  The search doesn't sound that lonesome with Chris Tile's smooth Vince Gill-like tenor that goes so well with Bentley's more rugged vocals.  Miranda Lambert adds rawness to \"Bad Angel\" -a quasi-Gospel romp about a man shrugging off vices at the \"crossroads of Salvation and Temptation Streets.\"  While Jamey Johnson with his world-weary gruffness brings a realistic feel to the man's battle with the bottle.  Kris Kristofferson, on the other hand, sounds worn out and short of breadth on \"Bottle to the Bottom\" that becomes distracting.  While the Alison Krauss' echoey vocals sounds like she was singing in a well on the progressive bluegrass title cut \"Up on the Ridge\"--a pretty non-descript song relative to the rest of the album.\n\nOf the newer songs, Shawn Camp and Paul Kennerley's bluesy \"Fallin' for You\" is hypnotic with a robust melody made even more delightful with its banjo and fiddle licks.  \"Draw Me A Map\" finds Bentley on more romantic grounds as he croons with affection to find his way into his lady's heart.  A definite must for those who like to experience the warmer side of Bentley.  Julie and Buddy Miller, often earmarked by their eccentric Americana endeavours, have ironically submitted the most commercial viable track here.  \"Love Grows Wild\" sounds like a future hit with its catchy melody and it's endearing lyrics.  Bravura is Bentley to taper U2's \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" chiming guitar riffs into something more rustic without sacrificing an iota of the song's spiritual and social depths.\n\nBentley has indeed taken a chance to go all out to record \"Up on the Ridge\" with little nod to commerciality.  He just lets his respect and love for tradition show.  And as a result, this will indeed pay off with dividends of pure pleasures to those who like their country uncluttered.  With this new disc, Bentley has made the bluegrass\/acoustic ridge viable again.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"One thing I've noticed in terms of the modern day 80's synth pop\/boogie funk revival is that it seems to stem more from electronic artists than those in the soul\/funk genre who actually innovated the approach originally.  M83 are a French group from Antibes,who formed about 15 years ago and are led by singer\/songwriter Anthony Gonzalez. There sound has apparently always embraced the retro 80's ethic by nature. But what bought me to this album was a similar quality to what bought me to St. Lucia at first: funny retro themed cover art. Once I actually took a moment to examine the contents within,the treasures of this groups most recent recorded effort began to reveal themselves.\n\n\"Do It,Try It\" starts the album with a synth washed operatic classical\/synth funk hybrid while \"For The Kids\",\"Solitude\",\"The Wizard\",\"Atlantique Sud\",\"Ludivine\" and \"Saturday Night 1987\" all come out of that same orchestrated ballad school-minus the danceability. \"Walkaway\" blues has a stripped down,vocoder powered synth pop groove while \"Bibi The Dog\" has a stomping electro funk thump. \"Moon Crystal\" is a very thematic TV inspired sounding pop number while \"Laser Gun\" has thick mid tempo industrial flavor that continues on the shuffling \"Road Blaster\". \"Tension\" takes that sound down a notch in content while the stripped down,synth bass heavy boogie sound of \"Time Wind\",with lead vocals from Beck round out this album.\n\nI have noticed that this album seems to be getting mixed reviews here on Amazon. Many of them seem to be based on the fact that this doesn't sound much like the bands earlier work. This sounds like a band I'll be seeking out more of in the future. But as for now taking this on it's own,it's a wonderful time capsule of different elements of the 80's synth pop\/dance\/boogie funk sound taken together in one album. Some of the songs are more groove oriented,others are more classically inspired \"dream pop\" while some are based in film\/television score music of the era. So it's a very enjoyable album for anyone who enjoys the electronic sonic qualities of the 1980's.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"\"The Middle\" by Jimmy Eat World is a positive song about having the self-confidence to see your own beauty and great qualities in yourself regardless of what others may think. This musical gem also serves as a reminder to do the best you can, and to be patient when allowing in all of the good in your life. I also appreciate that the message of the song is to also know that it is important to avoid giving power to what others may say or think (also the added insight to be and see your own brilliance regardless of if others would). Last, but not least, this energetic and fun musical track sends a great message about being emotionally strong (thick-skinned), and to project your personal power with your best effort while simultaneously being aware that everything in your life is going to be just fine. My favorite part of the song with the following lyrics communicates this meaning in a strong manner:\n\nIt just takes some time\nLittle Girl You're in the middle of the ride\nEverything, everything will be just fine\nEverything, everything will be alright, alright\n\n  \"The Middle\" is a brilliant track that applies to both men and women from all walks of life even with taking the \"little girl\" metaphor into account. I suggest this song (with absolute self-confidence) if you know that events in your life are going to unfold perfectly and in a joyful manner, but you also crave listening to a song that powerfully gives this reminder (in addition to sending the message to always see your personal beauty and unlimited power regardless of how others may treat you)","classification":5,"fold":6}

Love the smooth opening, slight Christopher Cross vibe (do not hold that against them)I also felt an I'm Not In Love by 10cc vibe, because I'm old. Very cool, echo female vocal over quality synthesizer rhythms that ebb & flow w\/great low key choral background. Song maintains cool slight psychedelic feel for the duration. No idea what the rest of their music sounds like. Absolutely love this track.\n\nGMF by John Grant. I should be too old to find this simple s\/sw song brilliant, but I do. Low key acoustic guitar & controlled synthesizers behind male lead vocal telling his story. The hook is what GMF stands for. It's included as the chorus of this okay singer songwriter number. Do not play with the kids in the car. Play for your old enough friends & surprise them. Greatest m f that you're ever gonna meet.\n\nThings Will Change by Treetop Flyers. Hate to compare new with old, 'try to do it only to compliment. This song sounds like an updated version of any classic by America (the band). Strumming acoustic guitar, tight backing band, similar male lead vocal, great lyrics, great sound, good production, quality song. Love it.\n\nNerve Endings by Eagulls. Brilliant punk opening, vocal & song. Sounds like past punk greats.(Not gonna compare) Strong back beat, great guitar & neat straining lead vocal. Song never strays from it's core of excellent. Absolutely love it.\n\nWaiting by The Dismemberment Plan. Neat lightweight Indie, post-punk revival, math rock, post-hardcore, experimental rock (thank you Wikipedia). Open male vocal over bopping band. Nice.\n\nParted Ways by Heartless Bastards. Recognizable, slightly shrill male lead vocal way in front of good sounding band keeping up with lyrics, allowed to play a little, couple of times. Noisy ending, nothing wrong with this song, you will love it.\n\nThey Told Me by Sallie Ford & The Sound Outside. Love the throbbing opening, strong female vocal over ongoing rocking band that threatens & defends the singer throughout. Very nice.\n\nLos Angeles by Emily Wells. Per Wikipedia Folk, Folk rock, Folktronica, Acoustic. This track is breathy female vocal over guitar w\/neat lyrics and not much else. You will love it, she has done much more.\n\nDogon Genesis by Lumerians. Great simple opening, vocals start, psychedelia ensues. Too many genres in Wiki to list, neat feel, deliberate vocal over speedy guitars including relentless bass. Superior version of modern progressive track. Like it(they mentioned 'Silver Machine' how not to like?).\n\nBermuda Highway by Christopher Denny. Female sounding vocal, appears he's not, let's say Roy Orbison. Acoustic guitar, deliberate spoken vocal that sings to us all, harmonica spurts, quality lyrics, complete sound. Like it.\n\nThis superior sampler from Partisan Records is worth money right now.

From \"Feel Invincible\" and \"Back From The Dead\", which are enjoyable rock songs, to \"Lions\" which is a very passionate worship song, to the adventurous and atmospheric \"Saviors Of The World\", this is a band that basically any music fan can listen to and not feel ashamed that they are moving away from their preferred genre.

{"text":"For the unaware, Thomas Bergerson is a composer who formed a partnership with fellow composer Nick Phoenix to start the company Two Steps from Hell specifically to produce music for music and video game trailers.  Their resume is too long to list.  Lets just say if you've seen any movie trailers for big budget movies in the past five years you have probably been exposed to some of their work.\n\nThis disk isn't Two Steps from Hell.  It's just Thomas and his music.  The inside cover of Illusions carries a message from Thomas.  He said that over the past three years whenever he felt he had written something especially special he saved it for this disk.\n\nHe was right.  This disk is filled with nothing but truly extraordinary music.  It is easily better than Skyworld, Archangel, or Invincible.  Please don't mistake that last statement as criticism of those three albums.  To compare by analogy, if those three were beer they would be Rochefort 6, 8 and 10 respectively.  Illusions is Westveletran 12.  If you're not a beer nut that's like comparing Colt Pythons from the 1970s, 1960s, and 1950s to a Korth.  If you're not a gun nut then I'm running out of suitable comparisons.  Lets just leave it at the work he and Nick did with Two Steps from Hell is phenomenal and Illusions is much, much better.\n\nIf you are still unsure about buying this disk, step on over to Youtube and do a search.

There really is only one Christina and know one compares to her. I hated that \"Bionic\" didn't do well because it was such a good album. It took some getting used too but she was just having fun on that album. \"Lotus\" is is fun filled, different, laid back at times, and emotional. There is a few that have to grow on me.... \"Circles\" (Which is weird and immature sounding like \"Bobblehead\") , \"Shut Up\" (Reminds me of a follow up of \"I Hate Boys\" except less fun), and \"Red Hot Kinda Love\" but overrall its a great sequel to \"Stripped\" which is her best album to date. As you will see, I love inspirational songs and she does them all!\n\nTop 5:\n1. Best Of Me - Sounds like it belongs on the \"Stripped\" Album right after \"Fighter\". Amazing self esteem song.\n2. Blank Page - Like \"The Voice Within\", \"Hurt\", and \"You Lost Me\" This song follows the same beauty of lyrics, emotion, and arrangement. Its a CLASSIC Christina staple.\n3. Just A Fool - I have to admit, I hate country music, but Blake and Christina together is SO AWESOME. I love this song and its a great second single.\n4.

{"text":"Tame Impala's previous album, 2010's superb 'Innerspeaker--as original and forward-thinking as it was compared to most modern psychedelic albums--was very reminiscent of '66-'67-era Beatles, if the Beatles of that time had time-traveled to the present and listened to massive amounts of Dungen's Swedish space-rock before recording their next album, making use of modern studio wizardry. But, while Kevin Parker's voice still sounds a lot like Lennon's (and probably always will), 'Lonerism' is a giant step forward in the evolution of their sound, seemingly influenced as much by the mid-70's, electronic-based interstellar sounds of bands like Tangerine Dream and Italy's Sensations' Fix as the Beatles this time around, while at the same time sounding utterly fresh and unique.\n\nOf course, Parker's ear for infectious pop melodies still recalls Lennon and McCartney circa 'Revolver,' as do most melody-centric psych bands worth their weight in salt. But 'Lonerism' features synthesizers playing as integral of a role as the walls of fuzzed-out guitars, and this adds a whole new dimension to their sound (or maybe I should say \"his\" sound, as Parker once again handles all songwriting, instrumental, and vocal duties). The spaces between riffs are taken advantage of as well, with ethereal atmospherics and intertwining melodies filling those gaps, and when combined with the virtual myriad of musical styles and influences contained within, results in one of the most ambitious, absorbing--at times even blissful--albums I've heard in recent memory.\n\nThe tripped-out, early-Floyd vibe of \"Apocalypse Dreams\" is the perfect evidence of this bliss, when--after a dreamy, chugging 3-minute buildup which abruptly cuts off into silence for a brief moment--a euphoric symphony of sounds erupts from the speakers, sending this listener off into deep innerspace, a journey I didn't come back from for a good 45 minutes, when the last notes of the album unfortunately faded. The melancholy \"Why Won't They Talk to Me?\" is another example, with Parker's multi-tracked, reverb-laden voice harmonizing with itself over an infectious, bouncing drumbeat and swirling synth and organ sounds, resulting in one of the most hypnotic headphone trips you're likely to ever hear. His lyrics here, and throughout the album, are despair-filled yet hopeful, matching the overall musical vibe of 'Lonerism.'\n\nWhile most albums released these days are front-loaded with the best tracks (now that I think about it, this is nothing new), this album really hits it's groove in the second half, imo. \"Feels like We Only Go Backwards\"--while upon first blush seems like a low-key, middle-of-the-road dreamy ballad--was totally embedded in my brain last night while I was trying to sleep, with it's insanely catchy and melodic chorus repeating itself over and over until I finally had to get up and listen to it, resulting in my listening to the entire album yet again. Which in turn resulted in my writing this review at dawn in a somewhat manic state, and on less than an hour of sleep.\n\nThe centerpiece of the album for me, however, is without question the near-epic penultimate track, \"Nothing That Has Happened So Far Has Been Anything We Could Control.\" It's probably the one most undoubtedly Beatles-y song on the album, and yet it's one of the most original, progressive, and just-plain-mindblowing tracks in modern psych, blazing it's own trail while using mid-late period Beatles as a launching pad. It's a masterpiece of obsessive production, with melodies snaking around melodies, weaving in and around the main hook to the point that it's nearly impossible to absorb it all on the first--or even second or third--listen. This song more than any other requires headphones for maximum effect, and is the perfect climax to a nearly-perfect album, with the whimsical, piano-laden \"Sun's Coming Up\" serving as the perfect coda.\n\n'Lonerism' is about as close to flawless as there is in modern rock music, imo, and should be a sure-fire contender for album of the year with most hard-core music aficionados, much like 'Innerspeaker' was two years ago. Though, unbelievably, this makes that album seem like a mere warm-up--an early, black and white predecessor to this high-definition, 3-D masterpiece. I have no idea where Kevin Parker (and co.) will go from here, but I can now guarantee you that I'll follow, no matter where the road takes him. Right now it's hard for me to imagine him topping this anytime soon, but after witnessing the creative leap made with 'Lonerism,' it certainly wouldn't surprise me.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I figured coming from such creative stock that Martha Wainwright's album would be 5+ star worthy.  It's good, but it's not great.  Like her brother Rufus, I like the idea of her, more than I actually like her.\n\nI have heard her sing with her father (Loudon Wainwright III) and she came across much more bluesy than she does on this effort (check out \"You Never Call\" on his live disk). Her voice on this disk hits some qualities of Marianne Faithful (great) to some more alt. generic female lead singer(not so great).\n\nThe good thing (for me) is that she kind of defies a certain style.  It's not that she's all over the place, just that the music doesn't fit nicely into one genre.\n\nWainwright's writing is pretty good for her initial effort. I think that's where all her family's strentgh lies anyway...which is not a knock to their performing abilities.\n\nBut like most disks there are some outstanding tracks: \"When the Day is Short\", \"Wither I Must Wander\" and the oft mentioned ode (?)to her father, \"BMFA\".\n\nIt's at least worth a check-out, if not a purchase.","classification":4,"fold":6}

It would be like Ron Wood finding four new guys and making Rolling Stones albums. This album was given to me by a friend and I listened to it. It is not a bad David Gilmour solo album, in general, his solo albums are not bad. However, I do have a BIG problem with him putting that Pink Floyd name on albums that are NOT Pink Floyd albums. And I have a problem with the delusionals that go ballistic defending this nonsense. There is no reason for Gilmour to continue to use the name, except to cash in on name recognition. I have no problem with being flamed for this review by the Roger haters and the David apologists, but one cannot simply review the music on this album and leave it at that, there is a moral problem here. I mean. considering the living status of all the members, we are in reality left with two musicians capable of contributing new music, David and Roger. Why is David allowed to call himself Pink Floyd, when Roger certainly has much more claim to that title. And if you don't think he does, you are too far gone to argue with. And spare me the \"Roger quit the band\" nonsense.","classification":1,"fold":6}

{"text":"Satellite Flight has always kind of been a little bit of a mystery since it was announced. Cudi announced the EP turned album when he was on tour in October and we didn't really hear much about it aside from the single \"Satellite Flight\" in December as well as the album artwork and the tracklisting. The EP was turned into an album at the last minute, and even today it doesn't make sense. The album features Cudi either rapping or singing on six of the tracks while the other four are instrumentals. The album comes and goes pretty quickly, lasting only 41 minutes, but leaves you satisfied and wanting more. Just like Cudi promised.\nLet's get the instrumental tracks out of the way. \"Destination: Mother Moon\" is a pulsing and cinematic track that sets the tone of the album well. \"Copernicus Landing\" starts out a little weird before really picking up towards the end, showing what's to come later in the album. \"In My Dreams 2015\" is something you would expect to hear while waiting in line for Space Mountain at Disneyland, that being said, it's actually a very enjoyable short little track. \"Return Of The Moon Man (Original Score)\" is the most epic sounding song on the album as it sounds like the rough synths were inspired by Kanye West's \"Blood On The Leaves\", It has an incredibly cinematic feel to it, and ties the first 8 tracks together well and sets up the last track beautifully. Cudi did an amazing job making the instrumental tracks just as vital and enjoyable as the others, which is never an easy goal to accomplish.\nCudi did a little more singing in the album than rapping, but that's okay because everything he does here brings back the feelings of some of the stuff he's done in the past. \"Going To The Ceremony\" sounds like it was originally supposed to be a WZRD track, but is one of the more easily likeable songs when it comes to new comers. \"Satellite Flight\" stood as the unofficial single from the album, and though it isn't really a radio hit, it shows that Cudi hasn't forgotten his roots and it's just refreshing to listen to, especially if you're a long time Kid Cudi fan.\"Balmain Jeans\" is the only song with a guest feature, curtosy of Raphael Saadiq, and it's near perfection. Saadiq's feature isn't huge as Kid Cudi dominates the song, but when he does come in, it's absolutely perfect. I'd almost go as far as to say \"Balmain Jeans\" is one of the most well-rounded and solid tracks Cudi has ever produced. (And that piano riff towards the middle of the song was incredible).\n\"Too Bad I Have To Destroy You\" was the one track I was looking forward to the most due to the title, and it stands as the trippiest song that Cudi sings on. The instrumental is similar to that of \"In My Dreams 2015\" but more friendly with Cudi's voice. He manages to stretch the song out for almost seven minutes, but he keeps it interesting throughout the entire song. \"Internal Bleeding\" is the only point in the album where the album kind of takes a misstep, but even then it's a very minor one. The production, like every other song on the album, is flawless. Though Kid Cudi overdoes the hook, some may like it, but it took me some getting used to. \"Troubled Boy\" stands out as the sore thumb when compared to the rest of the songs, but it mixes with the story perfectly. Cudi's singing is perfect for the acoustic guitar-dominated instrumental, and it ends very abruptly which not only sets up Man on The Moon 3 very well, but gives us somewhat of a cliff-hanger ending making us want more.\nSatellite Flight might be as close to perfection as we see this year. It may not make as much noise as major studio albums that will come out this year. But when you listen to this album from beginning to end, this could easily be one of the best, most rewarding album of the year.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 10\/10\n\nMUST HAVE SONGS: (This album is meant to be listened to from beginning to end, and you'll get the best experience doing it that way, but if you have to only get a few then...)\n\n- Balmain Jeans\n- Satellite Flight\n- Too Bad I Have To Destroy You Now\n- Return Of The Moon Man (Original Score)\n\nAuthor's Note: I've been a huge Kid Cudi fan since Man On The Moon: End of Day, in fact that album is my third favorite of all time, and after listening to this album all the way through four times, i've come to the conclusion that this is the type of album that in order to get the full effect, you need to listen from track one to ten without shuffling or skipping any tracks. It's truly an incredible project. It may not be as big or good as the original Man on The Moon, but it's almost if not just as rewarding as it. If you're a Kid Cudi fan, you've got to give this one a shot.","classification":5,"fold":6}

But when it has came down to covers, none have been as definitive as I Will Always Love You. The song is still just as impassionate and intimate as the voice that had made the Dolly Parton cover beyond all her own. I couldn't stop crying hearing the news of her death, but this is the definitive song in my opinion that the sweet voice will always be recognized. No matter whom comes around, and tries to sing this song, no one will ever come close to her voice.

{"text":"Tracy Chapman's 'Telling Stories' has garnered some rather mixed reviews both from the music press and general public, and while the album does not attain the heights of her landmark debut of 12 years ago, it would have to be considered her most consistently enjoyable album since that watershed moment in singer-songwriter history. Marrying her trademark folky introspection with warmer, more accessible pop arrangements we are given a great title track (albeit very reminiscent of Jackson Browne's 'Barricades of Heaven'), qualities of which are evident in the relative immediacy of many other songs here such as the knowing 'Less Than Strangers' (about an ex-lover), and the impassioned 'Speak the Word'. The Yearning, reflective threesome of 'Wedding Song', Unsung Psalm' and 'Devotion' sound deeply autobiographical and personal to a fault - Chapman at her best. To reiterate, there is nothing quite as brilliant as 'Fast Car' here - what you will find is a set of fine tunes by an artist that still has alot to offer the music world.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"There are exhilarating rock intros out there, like The Faces' Stay With Me, Iggy Pop's Lust For Life, and Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run. But I think Rush's The Spirit of Radio is the best of the bunch. The guitar riff is like my dog suddenly jumping on me in the morning, wake up and play and be happy! A big slobbery kiss at 0:04, I try to roll over but she just jumps over to that side as well, bounding all about. Finally at 0:17 I have surrendered to her will and I am up. Look out the window, turn on the coffee, eat some breakfast, get dressed, grab the leash and treats and baggies, and then at 0:42 we hit the open road for a walk.\n\nBegin the day with a friendly voice, a companion unobtrusive...well, I can't continue with the dog analogy because at 5 in the morning her voice is loud and obnoxious, and when we are out walking in the neighborhood she can occasionally be quite obtrusive. However, she is a very friendly companion.\n\nThe Spirit of Radio is about...drum roll...radio! The joy and beauty of music coming through the speakers, dancing around you on the airwaves, undemanding contact in your happy solitude. At 1:24, bass drum pounds and the first guitar riff returns, and another lyrical section about...the radio! Isn't it amazing! A gift beyond price. We can't see the airwaves, but we pick up on the sounds entering our ears, our bright antennae bristle with the energy, and the translation through our minds produces emotional feedback.\n\nOf course, although one likes to believe in the freedom of music, radio is a business, and there are glittering prizes and endless compromises going on behind the scenes that shatter the illusion of integrity, yeah.\n\nCheck out that tumbling down moment at 3:36, it's the exasperation of dealing with the radio executive, the schmoozing DJ, the Biz. But Rush pick themselves up for an introspective moment: For the words of the profits were written on the studio wall. They record the music and radio helps sell their albums, and the band members makes their livings this way, so buck up and deal with it. Did they think adding a reggae groove would help? Well, it didn't. This whole discussion of radio has made them bitter and reflective, so they decide to release their emotions with a sizzling guitar solo that extends out into their listeners' brains and by the end everyone is happy. And now, a thousand words from our sponsors, followed by a 90 minute classic rock music marathon, and we will only play songs you've already heard a zillion times because if you hear anything unfamiliar it might be considered obtrusive and we'd get in trouble with the FCC.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"There is honestly no question that when it has came down to great hard rock anthems, they just cannot get out of the head, and hit you smack in the soul of the heart. A.C.\/D.C. has honestly been delivering great rock music for forty years, and no song they have had honestly has been more potent and powerful like Back In Black. The song is just an infectious anthem that just really delivers, and ignites a flame that real matches a soul in the heart. Brian Johnson had a whole to drive on, after the passing of Bon Scott in 1980. He delivered, and the song still remains a remarkable blueprint of what great music really is. It still is a great song to listen to, and now, also with Malcolm Young leaving the group, it is more valued as a treasure to listen to the heart and soul of great rock music. I absolutely recommend this song for your music library.\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Around the time this album came out, most people were probably thinking, \"What has happened to Alice Cooper?\" or \"What is Alice Cooper thinking?\"  After he tried to reinvent himself for the 80s with Flush The Fashion, I think many people abandoned him for the cruddy new bands that started popping up.  The punk sound that he hinted at with Flush The Fashion and carried on with on Special Forces is still in play here.  This could actually be part 2 to Special Forces minus the ... attitude.  Alice uses this album to totally let loose his humor side with mixed results.  It's really not as funny as Alice thinks it is.  That's not to say I don't enjoy it, I do.  I actually like this album quite a bit.  I think it's great that he tried something different regardless of what people think.  The only flaw in my eyes is that it seems as though Alice Cooper-the man was taking a vacation from Alice Cooper-the character.  All of us fans fell in love with the creepy character of Alice Cooper, and this album comes across as an album by the man and not the character.  Look at his picture on the cover.  Yes, it is funny, but \"Alice Cooper\" wouldn't do something like that, or make an album of songs like that either.  Same can be said for Special Forces(though I can see the outfit working, but not the lyrics), or Flush The Fashion(where I can see the songs working but not the image).  This may sound like I'm putting these three albums down, but I really like and listen to them quite a bit.  This little known \"weird\" period of Alice's(Flush, Forces, Zipper, Dada) is very underrated if you ask me, and should be given alot more credit and attention than it does.  It's sad that the \"Trash\" period is more well known and favored.  I know this review won't be read by many because of that, and it's only hardcore Alice Cooper fans that will take any interest in this album at all.  And since that's the case, you already own it or you're eventually gonna get it and were curious about it....It'll be one step closer to having the whole collection, and you just may be surprised that it's actually a good album.  Different(it's no Love It To Death), but good nonetheless. ...","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"The album starts off strong with the lead single \"Hell On Heels\" which shows that these gals are not the typical pop divas that's currently being played on country radio. The music from the first single is both haunting, sassy, and very country as the women sings how their looks and brains will break a million hearts as they used men to get what they want. The next single is \"Lemon Drop\" which is simple and delightful. \"Beige\" is slow, but the twang of the lead vocalist is what makes this song special. \"Bad Example\" continues where \"Hell On Heels\" left off by showing these gals as some 'bad chicks' (in a good way). \"Housewife's Prayers\" is so smooth and sad because you know millions of women can identify with being neglected in their marriages and drowning in despair in their homes. \"Takin Pills' is funny but it leads alot to be desired. I wished they had developed that song more. \"Boys From The South\" is a great tribute to southern men and I have a feeling this will be a hit record if every released. \"The Hunter's Wife\" is wild to me bcause when was the last time you heard a country song sing about eating coon's stew? \"Trailer for Rent\" might be the most daring song because its almost as if they are singing about putting themselves for rent---to another man that is not their husband. The last song is \"Family Feud\" which is a page from my own family experiences. I especially love the last line \"The good Lord give it and the family take it away\".\n\nFor those who enjoy the safe, predictiable, and boring pop songs that's being played on today's country radio, this album is not for you. But for those who are missing real country done in a modern day style, with a twist of dare and spunk done by real southern divas, then this album is for you. Can't wait to hear the follow up although I have a feeling it will be while.","classification":5,"fold":6}
{"text":"When I listened to this \"Son of Believe\", I was impressed with the offering, and decided it was really the better looking brother of \"Believe\". \"Believe\" was a hard act to follow, but need i say?, Living Proof is just that!\n ON Believe Cher seemed to be more passive to the producers. Her involvement on this cd is very evident. She is there for multiple background choruses, and works all the vocals superbly. It's great to hear a girl singer with a lower register, and a way with a lyric. The work is there and the power of the singer is up front. I personally find a few of the tracks her highest achieving artistially ever! \"When the Money's Gone\" is a wonderful rocking dance rock track that finds Cher earnestly questioning the fidelity of her partner when the riches fall! It is a terrific track. \"This is a song(for the lonely\" is an anthem dedicated to the Sept . 11th victims and families, and she shouts it in plaintive cry, in the feel of a real rocker. It is full of emotion and conviction.\"Rain Rain\", has a hook that stays after one listen, and the depth that makes you glad you remembered it!\nCher's cover of Amber's hit, \"Love One Another\" does not become a brides-maid to Amber. She brings a low decible sincerity that only a mature woman can pull off. \"A different Kind of Love \"Song, is just that! AND....Cher universally dedicates it to everyone, acknowledging love in a universal way! Cher is no stranger to fame, and this cd will only add to her roster!!! I love it, and so will you. Cher sounds strangely youthful in 2001-2, and guess what..It's inspiring.","classification":5,"fold":6}

(It was my 17 yr. daughter who introduced me to her, incidentally). This live EP was recorded on the YS Fall 06 tour.\n\n\"EP\" (3 tracks, 24 min.) brings a new song, \"Colleen\", which is pretty much in the vein of the \"YS\" album. Next is \"Clam, Crab, Cockle, Cowrie\", from \"The Milk-Eyed Mender\" album, in a slightly altered version from the album. Then comes a 13 min. blow-out version of \"Cosmia\", from the \"YS\" album, which here live sounds much more invigerated than the album version, and I can't stop playing it.\n\nIf you are familiar with Joanna Newsome, this is a great companion to the \"YS\" album.

Shania went for a big pop sound, but radio from all genres are ignoring it because the song is only average. Shania really should return to her country roots and use less production on her songs. Her voice is better when the music is stripped down and simple. She also need to put more depth in her lyrics.

{"text":"As anyone knows what makes a film is not only the story but the music. \"Magic Mike\", being a film about male strippers, has an amazing soundtrack that will keep your blood racing while listening to it. To me the best track is the old 1983 remake of \"It's Rainin' Men\", a song originally recorded by \"The Weather Girls\", but here sung by Countra Black. One of the leads in the film, sexy Matthew McConaughey, even performs a track called \"Ladies of Tampa\".\n\n Other greats here include \"Breakdown\", \"Bang Bang Boom\", \"Feels Like the First Time\" and \"Sassy Sexy Wiggle\".\n\n \"Magic Mike\" was a box office hit on its first weekend of release making an astonishing $40,000,000 at the North American box office.","classification":5,"fold":6}

I loved her honesty in this song, and that's more than enough for a person to buy the song.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"It is absolutely so sad that a love that was inseparable had faded away. Unfortunately, for Celine Dion, she has been hit with so much sadness in her personal life from two devastating passings n her beloved heart. One of them is the sad death of her brother Daniel, whom died of cancer at 59 years old. Another one is the heartbreaking news that her soulmate and manager Rene' Angeil died after a severe battle of throat cancer that hurt their love and tore them apart. He battled in 1999 and survived, but it came back to take him for several years. When I think of Celine's sadness, I think of her song My Heart Will Go On from Titanic. It is one of those songs that really do strike you at the soul of the heart, and even more with the recent death of James Horner, and the hypnotic song that really grabbed you. Celine's heart will go on, but the heartstrings of her loves will always be in that song. That their souls will go on.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Yes I am a huge Shania Twain fan and I do enjoy Richie's music to an extent, but when I heard last year they were going to redo \"Endless Love\" my thought was, \"Are you guys crazy? That song belongs to Diana Ross and Lionel Richie so why tamper with a classic?\"\n\n To me the original version is still by far the best, but I have to give kudos to Shania Twain for giving one of her best vocal performances in her entire career. As anyone knows who has ever sung \"Endless Love\" it is one of the hardest tracks to nail as most of the song is sung on a high pitch, but Shania delivers and more. This was no small feat for her as she had not sung in several years and was having voice problems up until the day of the recording.\n\n Sadly the song bombed on country radio, but many have said (myself included) that it is one of the best singles on Richie's album \"Tuskegee\".","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Al Stewart (had a big radio hit with the song Year of the Cat) said recently that he still has a great fondness for \"jangle-y bands\" -- guitar-based good time pop music that rocks, but not too hard.  What the Bangles have produced on Doll Revolution is a classic of the jangle-y genre.\nWhen a band takes a break of over a decade and then re-forms for a new project, there is always justifiable worry that the old magic can't be captured again. The Bangles proved an exception to the rule by producing the strongest work of their career on this long-awaited new album. Granted, not every tune on Doll Revolution is a solid gold gem, but there are at least ten well-turned songs on this record, which is about the most anyone can reasonably ask.\nIf you liked the old Bangles, there is no reason you shouldn't be happy with the new Bangles. They can still rock, and sing beautifully produced and sincere love songs. If anything, their harmonies are sweeter and more perfect than ever. The recording does not have state-of-the-art clarity, which is a bit of a disappointment, but the fidelity is at least equivalent to their previous records from the eighties.\nThere is one sour note, not in the music, but in the fact that if you want the lyrics, you won't get them in the booklet. They are found only on the limited edition DVD version -- on the DVD. So you are supposed to run to your DVD player every time you want to check out the song lyrics? Not cool.\nThe Bangles have shown that you *can* go home again. They recorded this album on their own terms, took their time, and carefully crafted something they could be proud of. And they should be proud. This is good stuff. It isn't revolutionary, despite the title. They sing of love, loss, confusion, frustration, and loneliness. They make it rhyme, and they make us tap our feet and smile. I can't ask for more than that.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Actually three and a half stars but closer to 4 than 3.\n\n So blink 182 is back minus Tom Delonge, plus up one Matt  Skiba.  I will be honest, the vocal interplay between Mark and Tom was  One of the things that made blink 182 so great and unique. When Tom's voice started to get really annoying, Mark chimed in for some relief. When Mark started to sound a little boring after a while, Tom picked up the slack and made things interesting again.  Matt Skiba proves to be a worthy co-frontman, however his voice sounds strikingly similar to Marks, and on many occasions I cannot tell which one is singing lead vocals.  It took me a few listens to figure it out.\n\n There are a few songs on here that I would've liked to have seen cut from the album.  No future, teenage satellites, and the two joke songs  clutter the album and make it sound more generic.  I would even argue that the generic kings of the weekend should've been cut from the album.  Sometimes less is more!\n\n One of the big downfalls of the album in my opinion is the production and the overuse of  Cliche vocal harmonies layered on top of each other, the constant whoa whoa whoa's, na na na's, and gang vocals in nearly every song.  This gives the album a very one dimensional generic feel.  John Feldman is a good songwriter and producer in his own right, however I think  he did blink 182 a major disservice. It's obvious he had a little bit too much creative control over the album.\n\n On a positive note, there are a handful of some really great songs.  As mentioned above, Eliminating a handful of the weaker songs would have made this album much stronger. And of course, Travis Barker's drumming is amazingly killer as usual.\n\n Another positive thing about the album is that Tom Delonge's voice doesn't dominate nearly every song like it did in neighborhoods (and arguable the self titled as well).  This album gives Mark a chance to shine and let us hear more of his soothing baritone voice and catchy hooks.  Let's face it, Mark was always the better of the two singers when Tom was in the band.  And I would even say that Matt Skiba is a much better vocalist than Tom Delonge. But the last two albums with Tom had a little bit too much Tom on it. However, having no Tom at all isn't a good thing either. Tom's presence\/influence is definitely missing on this album, and even though Matt Skiba proves to be a great musician, it's just not the same.  If only Tom didn't get abducted by aliens....\n\n But it is what it is, and I applaud Mark and Travis from moving forward and doing what they love, even if it's without Tom.","classification":4,"fold":6}

The verses of I Wish are memories of carefree times, harmless naughtiness, and rites of passage that kids experience. You look back on it all as an adult, having learned to follow the rules but laughing inside because, even though you got in trouble, those activities were often pretty fun at the time.\n\nThe music says don't even bother trying to remain still, you have no choice but to get down and boogie. Listen to Stevie, he is really enjoying himself. Listen to that walking bass line, the horns, the drums pounding away. Cool middle part at 1:30, do do do do....break it down.\n\nThe extremely funky outro lasts for the final minute plus. The horn riff repeats over and over, as Stevie makes little shouts here and there, and Nathan Watts careens all over the bass with little spasms of funky joy. The horns rise up a couple times, Stevie plays a great drum roll at 4:03. And I guess we have to fade it out so Stevie has room for his other Songs in the Key of Life.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Wouldn't think I would ever say this. But I think Queensryche is stronger without Geoff Tate. Sure he wrote one of the best metal concept albums of all time (operation mind crime). And other great albums Empire, Rage of Order, The Warning, Promised Land Ect. But the last few years with Tate have been very lackluster with their albums and creativity. Not saying it was Geoff Tates fault. My the vibe and magic of Queensryche and creativity seem to be back, Todd La Torre has just brought back magic left out of Queensryche in the last decade. He has amazing voice and sounds striking similar to Tate at times. Not really sure how much input in has with the making of the songs and music. But whatever he added its much needed. Starting with Todd's first album with the band self tilted. Bringing the vibe of earlier albums with a modern sound. This album Condition Human is even better. Sounding like Empire or Operation Mindcrime on steroids. This album may be Queensryche's heaviest record to date. Huge heavy metal riffs over Todd's soaring vocals. The songs all sound different but some how sound like their in the same vein. This album as more of a traditional heavy metal sound, then compared to the Avenged Sevnfolds, or Slipknots or even the Asking Alexanders out there. Which to some may sound dated but I find very refreshing. These songs have more melody than most young bands have or need. Very strong album maybe one of their best soon to be consider a modern classic. Check it out if your a Queensryche fan!","classification":5,"fold":6}

Overall, I was not really thrilled with the music they released on their last album Ghost Stories. Their last album lagged with really triumphant music, except for one song, A Sky Full Of Stars. It really was a departure for Chris Martin and company, which failed to make a album really ignite overall. There is so much that they can do. Now with them performing at the Super Bowl this year, they absolutely have a lot of pressure on them, and that even has gone for their music. Their latest single, Adventure Of A Lifetime, isn't exactly one of Coldplay's best songs. It feels alright, but I was expecting something more cathartic and driven to their sound. While their video was cute, and reminds me a little too much of the bold Paradise video a few years ago, it really is all that makes the song stand out. Hopefully, there will be more music that is better from Coldplay down the road.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":6}

This is the only Brandy album I have that I kinda regret owning. \"Long Distance\", \"Right Here (Departed)\", \"1st & Love\" and \"True\" are the only songs I know I like on this album. That's not a lot. Too much filler I remember. Not a good look, Brandy. I wish she was still on Atlantic Records.

{"text":"Released in September 1983, and the 3rd album from Huey Lewis & The News, Sports (which shows the Mill Valley, California bar The 2 A.M. Club on both the front and back covers) took a while to reach # 1 on the Billboard Top 200 album charts, but it did so by the end of June 1984, and has since gone on to become multiple-platinum. By the end of that year it was rated the # 2 LP for 1984, back of only Michael Jackson's Thriller.\n\nThe album also produced five significant hit singles, starting with his cover of a 1981 Exile entry, Heart And Soul, which peaked at # 8 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in September\/October 1983 b\/w You Crack Me Up on Chrysalis 42726. The following January\/February, I Want A New Drug topped out at # 6 Hot 100 b\/w Finally Found A Home on Chrysalis 42766, and in May\/June 1984, The Heart Of Rock And Roll also reached # 6 Hot 100 on Chrysalis 42782 b\/w a \"live\" version of Workin' For A Livin' which was not part of the album. His third straight # 6 Hot 100 - If This Is It (as well as # 5 Adult Contemporary) then emerged in August 1984 on Chrysalis 42803. That B-side, Change Of Heart, was also not part of the album. Finally, in November 1984, Walking On A Thin Line got to # 18 Hot 100 on Chrysalis 42825, but again the B-side, The Only One, was not in the album.\n\nA bit of controversy surrounding the album was the lawsuit (eventually settled out of court) that claimed Ray Parker, Jr. had plagiarized I Want A New Drug in his 1984 hit Ghostbusters. The musicians\/vocalists involved with this production are: Huey Lewis on lead vocals and harmonica; bassist Mario Cipollina, and guitarist\/saxophonist Johnny Colla, lead guitarist Chris Hayes, drummer\/percussionist Bill Gibson, and keyboardist Sean Hopper, who all provide backing vocals as well. John McFee plays the pedal steel guitar on the great Hank Williams tune, Honky Tonk Blues.\n\nThe tracks, with writers in brackets, are:\nSide 1\n1. The Heart Of Rock & Roll (Johnny Colla & Huey Lewis) - 5:01\n2. Heart And Soul (Mike Chapman & Nicky Chinn) - 4:10\n3. Bad Is Bad (Alex Call, John Ciambotti, Sean Hopper, Huey Lewis, John McFee & Michael Schriener) - 3:46\n4. I Want A New Drug (Chris Hayes & Huey Lewis) - 4:46\nSide 2\n1. Walking On A Thin Line (Andr Pessis & Kevin Wells - 5:08\n2. Finally Found A Home (Chris Hayes, Huey Lewis & B. Brown) - 3:42\n3. If This Is It (Johnny Colla & Huey Lewis) - 3:46\n4.

{"text":"When Vivian Green first got her start, it was landing a co-writing credit on Boyz II Men's third album \"Evolution\" while she was still in high school. By the time she graduated, she found herself singing background vocals for fellow Philadelphian Jill Scott. A couple of years later, she signed a deal with Columbia Records to release her debut \"A Love Story\". She landed an instant hit on urban radio with the song \"Emotional Rollercoaster\". The problem was she got more attention from the Adult Contemporary format as opposed to urban contemporary that was geared toward people in her age group. On her sophomore album \"Vivian\", she sang about her divorce but got little to no support from the label. After a five year hiatus, she resurfaced on her new label E1 Music for 2010's \"Beautiful\". The album marked a noticeable change in her sound, as she was making a straight play for Top 40 urban radio. She emerged with her fourth album in 2012- her second release on E1 titled \"The Green Room\".\n\nOn her new album Vivian sticks to the radio friendly sound, only this time around she has better songs. Joining her on \"The Green Room\" is Vidal Davis of the production team Dre & Vidal- who also is the associate executive producer. Lyrically, Vivian seems to be more optimistic towards relationships, which is in stark contrast to her previous work. Look no further than the first two songs \"Remedy\" and the first single \"Anything Out There\". For the first time on her album, she has an appearance from a rapper- it's fellow Philly native and former Roc-A-Fella signee Freeway on \"X\". She demands to be herself in a relationship on \"Free As A Bird\", while making a club oriented song with \"I'm Not Prepared\". On \"Supposed To Be Mine\" and \"When Can I See You Again\", she returns to the sound that is remeiniscent of her earlier work. She works with smooth jazz instrumentalist Brian Culbertson and closes the album with \"Light The Universe\"- a collaboration with singers Algebra Blessett, Treena Ferebee, Laurin Talese and Leah Smith. While \"The Green Room\" shows Vivian has range, it also shows that going mainstream isn't for her. Deep down, she's a balladeer and that's where she works best.","classification":4,"fold":6}
{"text":"Going Back was originally released in 2010, with 18 songs on it, and 25 songs on the deluxe version. There were 4 more bonus tracks available on the DVD, which were downloadable, for a total of 29 songs.

This is a blunder in my view, no matter how he justifies it. Especially with 2 CDs to fill up. The other 15 songs could have (and should have) been somewhere on this collection, even if they were weaker than the 14 songs he chose to keep (which will be a matter of opinion to each listener).

{"text":"This album shows what truly made the Bee Gees great and that they stood on their own merit of great songs and wonderful productions. This album is their Crowning Achievement of the 4 they would release in the 1960's in only a short 2 year period! This remaster was done wonderfully and even has the original red velvet cover with the big gold lettering of the original. As an earlier reviewer stated, this album definitely got the royal treatment! From a historical perspective, Odessa was such a strong statement by the band and was one of three epic double albums released that year by a British Band, the other 2 being \"Tommy\" by the Who and \"White\" album as it's called by the Beatles.\n\nAlthough never really thought of in this way, the Bee Gees were a part of the last wave of the \"British Invasion\" bands and were, even at their young age, contemporaries of the other bands such as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Who, Yardbirds, etc. This album was the one that there manager, Robert Stigwood, really wanted to be a kind of \"statement\" album. The band was growing up and their songs and sound, already incredible, were becoming more mature and evolving. The comparisions to the Beatles have always been uncalled for in my opinion as I have always felt that the brothers had a sound and style of writing that was uniquely theirs.\n\nBarry & Robin Gibb, in my opinion, were every bit the writers as Lennon\/McCartney or Townshend\/Entwhistle or Jaggar\/Richards and this album is proof of how intricate and diverse their songs could be. The epic title track shows their strong ability to \"story tell\" as they take us on a journey across the atlantic ocean. Then you have songs with a country fell such as \"Marley Purt Drive\" to the folk sounding \"Melody Fair\" to the bouncy \"Suddenly\" amongst others. Maurice Gibbs wonderful talent for writing melodies and being able to play multiple instruments really comes through strong as well.\n\nThis album really showed that the \"boys\" were growing up musically, at the time of its release, Barry was 22 and Robin and Maurice 19. Unfortunately, after the release of this album, problems arose to the point that Robin left the band and the next album was recorded without him. Fortunately for us, their fans, he would return after a brief hiatus and they would then begin the second phase of their incredible careers. That being said, Odessa was truly the Crown Jewel of the early phase of their careers and a wonderful album, fresh and clean, all these years later.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I really liked \"Science and faith,\" Irish trio The Script's second album. There was just the right balance of anthemic pop and modern rock\/rap to keep a balance. On #3, the rapping overwhelms. The album tends to bland out after the first few songs and the stronger singles. \"Hall Of Fame\" drew me in when it was used on the World Series' baseball commercials, and it sounded like the band was once again going to hit the right notes. But the lyrics\/raps are loaded with cliches, the rapping is excruciatingly monochromatic, and only \"If You Could See Me Now,\" lead singer  Danny O'Donoghue's ode to his dead father, has the emotional wallop of anything from \"Science and Faith.\"\n\nI'll also give a tip of the hat to \"Kaleidoscope,\" which grapples with a U2 sound and \"Glowing,\" which is a well structured piano rocker minus the annoying rapping. That makes four songs I like on an album of 10; not a good batting average. #3 is not a bad album, just an average one, slickly produced and full of confidence, but just feels like a step in the wrong direction for The Script.","classification":3,"fold":6}

I love it!  Though some might disagree, \"Madness\" almost channels the U2 classics \"Lemon\" and \"Walk On\" especially how both Bono and Bellamy hit their vocal peeks by the end of their songs.  The messaging surrounding \"Madness\" is splendid as one might struggle to let go or to not let go of a complicated romance.  Matthew Bellamy just nails his vocals and definitely was worth the Grammy-nomination for Best Rock Song (too bad it didn't win).","classification":5,"fold":6}
{"text":"Admittedly, I was not a fan of Phillip Phillips during the initial run of American Idol Season 11.  In fact, I was rooting for a Joshua-Jessica finale!  But after hearing Phillip Phillips singing \"Home\" on the Season Finale, I knew this would be a single I'd love to have - and I became a fan of his at that point!\n\nThe more I listen to it, the more I enjoy it.  It starts off with Phillips singing on the guitar, and then segues into a strong crescendo where Phillip soars on the high notes with a strong drum beat in the background.  It was so much fun listening to it on the Olympics during the gymnastics competition that I downloaded it again onto my Cloud Player.  I dare you to listen to \"Home\" without smiling and tapping your toes!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Emmylou Harris has not released a full studio album since 2008. It hasn't been a long wait, but it's had a big payoff. It would have been hard to top her last effort, All I Intended to Be, but she hasn't quite done that yet.\n\nHard Bargain starts out with one of the most epic opening songs in recent memory. \"The Road\" is a booming tribute to Gram Parsons and the mark he made on her life and music in his short but influential life and career. It's a touching story song with an instrumental and vocal performance guaranteed to take your breath away.\n\n\"The Road\" is a fitting start to an album that will take your breath away. It has all the classic elements of an Emmylou Harris album: love, loss, acceptance, and a touching love of dogs. The songs are honest and emotional. They tell stories that everyone knows, in a way only Harris could tell them. But her musical influences are more obviously diverse on Hard Bargain, taking elements from various points of her later career.\n\nA startling rockier side to Harris is shown in songs like \"Six White Cadillacs\" and especially on \"New Orleans.\" Her voice is melted into a background of pounding drums and electric guitar. Songs like \"Home Sweet Home\" and \"Hard Bargain\" are are more optimistic and poppy. They have more subdued instrumentals.\n\nAmong Harris' quieter ballads are \"Nobody,\" \"The Ship on his Arm,\" \"My Name is Emmett Till,\" and \"Darlin' Kate\" (one being the tribute to a boy murdered in Mississippi and the last being a tribute to Canadian folk singer and friend Kate McGarrigle). All of them are powerfully delivered, but they fall unfortunately short.\n\n\"Big Black Dog\" is one of the bouncier sounding songs on the album and it has the sweetest and simplest story to tell. It is just what it claims to be: a song about a big black dog that Harris rescued.\n\nAlthough Harris has always sung very personal songs, Hard Bargain focuses more on her insecurities on feeling alone and on growing older in songs like \"Nobody\" and \"Lonely Girl.\" It's nice to see this tender side of Harris, but neither song is particularly memorable.\n\nHard Bargain is full of old comforts and unexpected new developments in Harris' career. It has something for many of her fans and shifts effortlessly from one sound and mood to the next. But there are too many moments on it that fall short of the kind of masterpieces Harris has made in the past.","classification":3,"fold":6}

I'm amazed how great it sounds, totally fresh, alive, out front, honest, real, classic live-studio sound with excellent instrumentation with nice studio remix for the effects,  and just a great, fresh sound, and great songwriting.

{"text":"This is a typical T Bone Burnett production: bizarre, pretentious, and gimmicky arrangements and a muddy sound mix that feels as it was recorded underwater.  Whatever nuance or individuality the artists he records may have, seem to get lost in Burnett's uniform and inflexible approach to recording.  So, although artists such as Elvis Costello and Jim James appear on it, don't expect it to sound like one of their typical recordings, nor the other artists who appear on it.  Listen to sound clips before you buy this album;  it has a very unusual sound.

{"text":"Without a doubt, Carole King has to rank among the top ten songwriters of the 20th century.  While I haven't seen the musical, I approach the music looking for fresh interpretations of classic songs.  Jessie Mueller's voice is a kissing cousin to Carole's and fits her classics like a glove.  \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" glitters with glorious harmonies, \"All you have to do is touch my hand to show me you understand & something happens to me.\"  Jessie and Jake Epstein who plays Carole's first husband and songwriting partner Gerry Goffin do an amazing duet on \"Take Good Care of My Baby\" with a touch of Broadway schmaltz thrown in for good measure.  Jessie's take on \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\" does not over-reach and comes across as breathtakingly heartfelt, \"Will my heart be broken when the night meets the morning sun?\"  The stage version of The Shirelles do a second version with strings and polish.  Anika Larsen plays King contemporary Cynthia Weil and does a great version of Weil's \"He's Sure the Boy I Love.\"  Carole King the Musical again dips out of her catalogue for a strong version of \"On Broadway\" by the stage Drifters.  Ashley Blanchet as Little Ava rips up \"Locomotion.\"  Act I closes with a blazing version of \"One Fine Day\" with Jessie Mueller, Rashidra Scott & the Three Girls ripping the song upbeat.  Act II opens with our stage Carole and the backup singers rocking out on \"Chains.\"  Jarrod Spector as Barry Mann totally rips up \"We Gotta Get Out of This Place,\" a hit for The Animals written by Mann and Cynthia Weil.  The ensemble does a wonderful job on Weil\/Mann hit \"Uptown.\"  Jessie Mueller does a great rendition of Carole's \"Tapestry\" classic \"It's Too Late\" and the lovely classic \"You've Got A Friend.\"  Mueller does a delicious job with King's classic \"Beautiful,\" \"I have often asked myself the reason for the sadness in a world where tears are just a lullaby.\"  The musical concludes with Carole's thundering \"I Feel the Earth Move.\"  This is a dynamic cast album, charming because the music is familiar, ultimately successful because it is so well performed.

{"text":"It's encouraging to see that a batch of late-'70's and early-'80's albums have been newly (circa 2012) reissued on CD--by a label called BBR (Big Break Records).  \"Bonnie Pointer\" is the first one of them I've bought, because it contains one of my all-time favorite disco songs, \"Heaven Must Have Sent You\".  The original LP did not contain the disco version that eventually became a #11 pop and Top Ten Disco hit, but this reissue cures that by including both the 7\" and 12\" versions of it.  The other three bonus tracks are all versions of the record's first single, \"Free Me From My Freedom\/Tie Me To a Tree (Handcuff Me)\".  The latter, which is not a medley by the way, has a very interesting lyric that seems to have caused the single to stall at mid-chart, at least on the pop side.  Some programmers & listeners felt it was either an S&M reference, or as the liner notes say, \"a step back for the feminist movement.\"  It is open to either that interpretation or Bonnie's--that she meant to be tied and handcuffed with love, not literally, after finding independence to be disappointing.  \"Put love's chains back on me...\"\n\nThe rest of the record covers a wide range of styles.  I think Bonnie sounds a lot like Carole King on \"More And More\" and I'm hearing some Billie Holliday in \"My Everything\".  Another Motown remake (besides \"Heaven Must Have Sent You\", originally a hit for the Elgins) begins the album:  \"When I'm Gone\" is a (literally) snappy version of the Brenda Holloway classic.\n\nI wouldn't say the sound is \"muddy\" as another reviewer put it, but I can't say it leaps out of the speakers either.  I'd be curious to hear\/read what other buyers think about this.  On the plus side, the packaging is excellent, with great photos and an extensive essay by Christian John Wikane.  The notes give a brief history of the Pointer Sisters before (thoroughly) discussing the making of this album.\n\nMore about \"Heaven\":  it opens with a machine gun drum blast, has the guitar jangling all the way through, features a 2-minute wild string-and-drum break, and ends with Ms. Pointer channeling Louis Armstrong.  One of the most amazing disco productions ever!","classification":4,"fold":6}

Misty Mountain Hop also. Some LZ fans want every song to be about Lord of the Rings: 'hey dude, that song Hot Dog? It's about the hobbits wanting to enjoy some elevensies, you know, have a little snack after traveling so far.'\n\nThis is also one of their Light and Shade songs, featuring gentle acoustic guitars giving way to heavy electric guitars.\n\nSomething like that. Ramble On is also one of your Robert Plant double tracked vocal songs. You can hear it mostly at the end, it's like there are two Roberts singing, separate but equal. You can also hear this phenomenon in songs like Babe I'm Gonna Leave You and Whole Lotta Love.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Stagger Lee and I Need A Miracle give the hometown crowd a preview of two new songs. The remander of the disc is filled with the last half of the second set. I Got My Mojo Working is a good version coming out of space with War's Lee Oscar filling in on harp. The Other One is massive before flowing into one of the best Stella Blues out there.

Not so, in this case, since they add diversity and make for a well crafted group of songs. All of the lyrics are obviously from Melissa, since no one else can show that much passion.  A Little Hard Hearted has a strong Beatles influence and A Little Bit Of Me has a bit of a bubbly South African influence to it (and is the only cut that is directed beyond her usual target audience).  All The Way Home is a double entendre about driving a car and sex. There are two songs that contain rap, which I normally hate, but both are done very well here (Monster and Ain't That Bad).

Blige released her eighth Studio Album Growing Pains. one of her at least very unique Albums of  her career. many fans all over the world were pretty unhappy with Direction of this Album.

{"text":"I'll admit, I was a little hesitant coming in, but if you're a fan of The Bird & The Bee or their style of music, you should be a fan of what you hear. Hall & Oates fans may also find it interesting just because these takes are usually so different, yet so in line with the originals. The sound is trippy, chill, synth & decidedly 80s. Even if you don't like Hall & Oates, you should like this album. In addition to the hits that everybody knows, Bird & the Bee also take on their lesser known hits which I'm now discovering and loving, which is always a joy of a cover album.\n\nOverall, I don't know how much longevity this project will have for its listeners, but this is a great covers album that is both true to the bands covering and being covered. Remember, this is only volume 1 so expect more great covers from The Bird & The Bee soon.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"This CD shows two things, one the brilliance of Bloomfield's playing and two, just how far he had fallen as a result of his Heroin addiction.  After nine hours of recording, Bloomfield and Kooper completed Bloomfield's \"Albert's Shuffle\", \"His Holy Modal Majesty\" and \"Really\", Howard Tate's \"Stop\", and Curtis Mayfield's \"Man's Temptation\". At the completion of these first five tunes, Bloomfield packed up his things and abruptly left the studio. Kooper wanted to complete the recording so he picked up the phone and called Stephen Stills.  Still's agreed to finish the sessions.  As such you get two very different sounding recordings here.  The first half--Kooper and Bloomfield which contains some very nice blues and classic Bloomfield guitar. The last half features Kooper and Stills complete with jangly guitar and Buffalo Springfield like vocals.  The disc is rounded out with some added bonus material featuring remix versions of \"Albert's Shuffle\" and \"Season of the Witch\" without the horns and two others. An added bonus is \"Fat Grey Clound\" which is a masterpiece in itself. On the other hand, while this disc has some good tunes on it the addition of Stills and absence of Bloomfield leaves the recording with a hodgepodge quality.  As an alternative or in addition to this disc, check out the \"Lost Concert Tapes\".","classification":4,"fold":6}

And \"Close Your Eyes\", Brahms Lullaby, is heard from time to time on Christmas CDs, though it isn't truly a Christmas song.  However, with Shawn's voice, all of these are good.\nRegretfully, I can't put this album into the same category that I have put CDs by other female vocalists such as Judy Collins, Natalie Cole, Anne Murray, or Julie Andrews.

{"text":"This cd is an awesome example of how disco was not a truly terrible music period and that when fused with other styles it could produce pure magic.  Many will look at the set list here ands see two things - the hit single WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN and the huge TSOP by MFSB which featured The Three Degrees.  But what we really have here is the debut US album by the queens of Philly soul who managed to merge heavenly soul and r@b with disco to produce harmonies and tracks that were mesmerizing.  The opening DIRTY OL MAN is stupendous and was a huge dance hit.  Other gems here are CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ME, A WOMAN NEEDS A GOOD MAN and the totally overlooked masterpiece IF AND WHEN that should have been another huge hit.  Their harmonies blend perfectly on every track but here they manage to even add a touch of rock to their style.  Of course due to the time period we do have one very dated track and it is the silly I LIKE BEING A WOMAN.  But it is such fun to hear it and see how it fit in during that time in music's history.\n\nThis cd is digitally remastered for superb sound quality and has great bonus tracks and liner notes.  There are certain albums that show a time period in all it's glory.  Here we have a uniquely talented female group with exsquisite harmonies.  They represented Philly soul at its finest and this cd is a must for any music historian or fan of the genre.  When music is good it is good and these ladies are great and this set provides a superb listening experience.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Throughout the 70's a group known as Earth Wind & Fire brought happiness to the radio waves and the dance floors.  This group had some outa-sight funky songs that made you tap your foot and roller skate to the rhythm.  Their songs, reflecting the innocence of the era, were colorful and upbeat.  The direction and genius of Maurice White was responsible for making this funk possible.  Vocally, they were a soulful chorus with Phillip Bailey's falsetto leading throughout most of these songs.\n\nThe opening number \"Shining Star\" is more than a far-out funky tune.  Just listen to that vocal blend and that rousing arrangement.  \"That's The Way of the World\", \"September\", \"Sing a Song\", \"Mighty Mighty\", \"Saturday Night\", and \"Get Away\"  are trade mark songs of the group.  Nobody can remake these or has even tried.  Yet, the group has successfully recorded other's songs like \"Can't Hide Love\" and \"Got To Get You Into My Life\".  The highlights that deserve giving more than a quick listen are \"Fantasy\" which is a gorgeous blend of voices,  \"Kalimba Story\" which a totally original song written by Maurice White, \"Reasons\" which is a gorgeous love song with Phillip Bailey in the lead vocal, and last, but not least, \"After The Love Has Gone\" which is a very fine ballad.\n\nOne cannot leave out the musical arrangements that accompany the vocal group of Earth Wind & Fire.  While it is extremely rare today to find comparable talent on a recording, it was also quite rare in the 70's era to find such artistry on studio recordings.  But this is what added to the group's sound and what made them so popular.  There were rich sounds from not only keyboards, guitars, drums, and saxophones, but instruments that brought the full experience:  trumpets, trombones, congas, flutes, violins, violas, tubas, harps, and timpani.\n\nThis collection of songs is fun for those who remember the funk era and fun for those who just want to experience enjoyable, upbeat music.  A must have treasure!!!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I had no idea a new Mavericks disk, 'In Time', was coming out. It has been,like, a decade. I assumed their split was permanent and I went on to buying Raul Malo's solo disks, which actually shined brighter than some of his group material.\n\nMalo has a great sense of artistry - be it solo or in group form. His voice is just so great. But the styles from group to solo are different enough and I almost forgot what the Mavericks sounded like.\n\nAt times the group can lean heavily on mariachi-like stylings. That is fine for a song or two. For an entire album, almost every song, it gets tiring. I know looking at other reviews, I'm in the minority here. I'm used to that.\n\nThe way to deal with that is just not to listen to the entire album at one sitting.  That sounds counter intuitive for that medium. I get that people don't listen to full albums anymore, but I still believe bands make them for that purpose.\n\nI like many of the songs on 'In Time' - \"Come Unto Me\" (both English and Spanish versions), \"That's Not My Name\",  \"Forgive Me\",  \"All Over Again\" and others.\n\nI will go on record that the roller\/ice skating rink organ of \"Amsterdam Moon\" totally ruins the song.  Horrid.\n\nStill any Mavericks \/ Malo is better than none and still better than most anything on the radio.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"If Mott the Hopple didn't help invent punk, they certainly were the midwives that helped with the delivery. Mott was a unique band--with they were never less than soulful even on their weakest material. Ian Hunter's Sonny Bono\/Bob Dylan delivery gave an impression of what the Pretty Things or Stones would have sounded like with either one of those singer\/songwriters as their front man.\nMott is a nearly flawless album. Hunter came into his own as a songwriter. I Wish I was Your Mother, All the Way to Memphis and Ballad of Mott (co-written with all the band members) all manage to capture Hunter's gritty and blunt assessment of the world packaged in a melodic and colorful box.\nRalphs contributes a couple of strong tracks as well although his contributions are a bit more subdued than on All the Young Dudes. Clearly Hunter had taken Bowie's advice and stepped to the forefront as both frontman and songwriter. This managed to make the band better and also caused the original line up to splinter with Hunter the next casuality.\nThe problem with this great album is the sound quality. The CD sounds flat and muddy. When you compare the sound quality here to the remastered editions of both All the Young Dudes and The Hoople, it's clear that this album is in bad need of a facelift. If you're a fan of the band let Sony\/Columbia know that this needs all the attention, remixing and remastering that was applied to both the selections from the box set and the other two MTH Columbia studio albums.\nOh, and pick up Hunter's Rant. He's in fine form again and it's evident he hasn't lost his edge.","classification":5,"fold":6}

But they haven't yet done a collaboration with their music for their fans with other singers. They have decided to give it a shot with Rihanna on Princess Of China, the third single from their latest album Mylo Xyloto. The song is very melodic from the music alone, yet it doesn't even come that way in tems of the chemistry Rihanna has with Chris Martin & company. Sadly, she has absolutely no connection with the song that has made Coldplay so distinctive this past decade. In fact, she kind of makes the song very wimpy, and lacking chemistry. I think it would've been better off from Chris's voice alone, or if they has teamed up with someone whom had a better voice. This is Coldplay's first time teaming up with someone else.

I'm not literally a code monkey, but there's not doubt that I'm a nerd, the proverbial nice-guy who comes in last and can't get the pretty receptionist to pay any attention to me, who works hard in a job that's boring and unappreciated. Goodness, I even like to drink Tab and eat Fritos. I'm not the only person like this. So, I just love it for being a good song acknowledging my experience of the world, while being funny and hopeful, too. It's a great song that I've found myself passing along to my nerd friends who love it, too.","classification":5,"fold":6}
{"text":"It is sincerely sad that whenever someone is on top of their game with good music, can actually have a set of songs that can cause them to lose control with their credibility. Meghan Trainor has been one of those artists that just came out a few years ago, and scored some big hits like All About That Bass and Dear Future Husband. But overall, when you can make a namesake for yourself, you also can easily lose it with the wrong set of songs that can make you lose your career. Her latest set of songs has been fairly good with Better When I'm Dancing from The Peanuts Movie, but when I had heard this song, I thought she is going to make a tailspin down. NO, the lead single from her Thank Album is really a move that could also derail her career, trying to be a little bit of hip hop and pop, into the styles of Rihanna and Beyonce' into her music. Sadly, the song does not even work all out Meghan, and I'm not very thrilled overall. The song was definitely not even worth listening to overall.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":6}

{"text":"I read some of the negative reviews of India. Arie's Voyage to India album and I wonder if those reviewers listened to the whole album. Sure, she gets preachy at times on here, but that's only on two or three songs, and even those are good. And every time I listen to this album, I love it even more.\n\"Little Things\" is an okay song for a first single, but there are better songs than that on here. Check out the two highlights, \"Good Man\", where India tells a story about a man who tells his wife to remember him if he dies someday, and \"Talk to Her\" (which is still very preachy), where India tells men to respect their women. The latter, as well as a few other songs, features Laurnea, who's been M.I.A. from the industry for a while. Where did India find her??? Even as a backup singer, she shines like she always did.\n\"Can I Walk With You\" has that ready-for-VH1 feel to it, as does \"Interested\", but that doesn't make these songs any less engaging. Also, I noticed that \"Slow Down\" has the same melody as last year's \"Back to the Middle\". But this album is still solid. Don't buy it expecting some kind of growth in songwriting or spiritual evolution (it's only been a year since her Acoustic Soul album). Because while there are no recognizable standout singles by the likes of, say, \"Brown Skin\", you'll be missing out if you don't take this voyage to India.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"I love this stuff. Dance music that is so well done, so well sung, so well performed, that it leaves you in awe. I first heard Pet Shop Boys when they burst on the dance and pop scene back in the early 80s. Their Bobby O produced single \"West End Girls\" was an ear-opening experience. I was an instant fan. At the time I was also a big fan of \"alternative\" rock, but Pet Shop Boys were the ones to satisfy my inner disco soul. Their music was, and remains, a gulity pleasure for me. But of course they weren't just dance dudes, their music had --- and still has --- a very strong melodic pop sensibility to it. But I'm preaching to the choir here, I think. You all know how good their music is. And this 2-CD compilation is no exception. Admittedly, I have NOT been listening to each and every album PSB have released since I moved overseas in 1996. As another reviewer noted, the music they have done since then is practically that of a separate era. And yet ... their basic sound has not changed much during those long years. Their songs still sound vibrant and exuberant. The formula may remain the same, but don't go thinking PSB have become stagnant or that the songs on this compilation are inferior to their earlier tunes. With 38 songs on here, I assure you that there are some real gems to be found ... and heard. My personal faves are found on disc two; songs such as \"The Resurrectionist\" , \"Friendly Fire\", and \"Always\". But that's this week. I just got this collection last week and I'm certain that other tracks will endear themselves to me soon enough. Such is the beauty of Pet Shop Boys songs. Despite what some critics may say, there is depth and variety to their music. Music to dance to, songs to sing, melodies that linger. What more do you need?","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I recently discovered Virtual Box Set  Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas while browsing through the digital music section at Amazon.com. When I saw this MP3 albums amazingly low price of $6.99 for the entire collection of 32 Beethoven piano sonatas, I immediately purchased it. I am very glad I did.\n\nJen Jand&oacute; is a Hungarian concert pianist who has recorded for the Naxos classical music label for over twenty years. He is the featured soloist on Virtual Box Set  Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas, and his performances of these masterworks are uniformly excellent. Jand&oacute; plays in a highly polished, artistic, and yet straightforward manner that conveys Beethovens full range of emotions very effectively, but without any unnecessary musical flourishes. He is very easy and enjoyable to listen to. I don't think he is in quite the same exalted company as elite concert pianists like Murray Perahia, Vladimir Ashkenazy, or Martha Argerich, (to name but a few), but Jand&oacute; acquits himself very well indeed in each note of every Beethoven piano sonata he plays.\n\nI think Virtual Box Set  Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas by Jen Jand&oacute; is an excellent way to acquire a complete cycle of Beethoven's piano sonatas at a very affordable price. While perhaps not the very top choice for these works, it is certainly a clear winner, and one of my new favorites. Highly recommended. (4 Stars ^ 5)","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Music: 4.5 stars; compilation 3.5 stars\n\nIf I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it: a greatest hits compilation on Coldplay (released in Eastern Europe). I am 99 percent certain that this is NOT approved by the band, but since it's out there for the world to see, how does this stack up?\n\n\"Greatest Hits\" (2 CDs; 37 tracks) is a generous if politically incorrect compilation covering the Coldplay output up to and including 2011's Mylo Xyloto album. Let's break it down: we get 4 pre-Parachutes tracks: No More Keeping My Feet Off the Ground (from the 1998 Safety EP), Brothers & Sisters and Only Superstition (from the 1999 Brothers and Sisters EP), and See You Soon (from the 1999 Blue Room EP). The Parachutes era gets 8 tracks (all but two of the album's tracks). The Rush of Blood To the Head era gets 6 tracks. X&Y gets 7 tracks, as does the Viva la Vida\/ Prospekt's March era. Strangely, the then-most recent album Mylo Xyloto only gets 4 tracks. This means that the compilation is heavily stacked towards the early material: 1998 to 2002 get half of the tracks, and the rest up to 2011 the other half. Is that a good or bad thing? Depends on who you ask. I'd say this is a good thing, as I am of the opinion that with each subsequent release, Coldplay becomes less and less essential (Mylo Xyloto easily being their weakest album to date).\n\nCouple of comments: first, despite its generous number of tracks, there are still some key moments that are missing in my humble opinion. They include (in chronological order): Moses, the single from the Live 2003 album; Talk, the monster single from X&Y; Christmas Lights, the non-album single from 2010; and Princess of China, a huge hit single from Mylo Xyloto. Second, the sequencing of this particular compilation makes little sense and in fact throws you for a loop on more than one occasion (going from Only Superstition to Prospekt's March? from Glass of Water to God Put a Smile On Your Face? wow). Much better in my opinion would've been to place all songs chronologically. Third, Coldplay is one of those bands that used to have great extras tracks on its singles (back in the day when single CDs were still issued), not unlike, say, Oasis, Travis or Depeche Mode just to name those. A couple of them are on this compilation. But many more such great B sides are not. If it was me, I'd remake this 2 CD compilation with CD1 having strictly the very biggest hits, and CD2 all of the best B sides and other one-offs. But those are just personal (and hence subjective) musings.\n\nThe bottom line is that this 2 CD collection is a curious compilation that contains a lot of great music.","classification":4,"fold":6}

The better tracks include Top Toe, On Top of the World & Bleeding Out, personally Radioactive doesn't do it for me.\n\nThis album is by no means perfect, but as every band that has stood the test of time it is a first step unto something great.

{"text":"Jennifer Hudson blew moviegoers away with her movie debut, \"Dreamgirls.\"  What astounded them most was her powerful alto singing voice.  Couple that with the fact that she played the role of Effie White to perfection, and never wonder why she held everyone's attention.  It also doesn't hurt that she seems to be a down-to-earth and sincere individual.  If you want to know what makes me say that, check out her blogs, home videos and interviews.  However, never mistake her for a pushover, because she can be frank.  For example, Jennifer Holiday said something smart about the fact that Hudson redid the song \"And I Am Telling You\" and Hudson gave Holiday a piece of her mind in a magazine.\n\n \"Spotlight\" is one of the standout songs of 2008, make no mistake about it.  The song has the Neyo signature sound (he wrote and produced the hit song) and Hudson really did a magnificent job.  As for the album, I was a disappointed with it as a whole.  There are highlights and memorable moments, but, really, they are the songs that were released to radio, mostly.  This album has its share of bland moments.  Some people will lose interest by the middle of the disc.  Jennifer's voice shines on each and every track, though.  She is an effortless talent and she makes that obvious to anyone who observes her.  Fantasia, T-Pain and Ludacris all make guest appearances.  I was gleaming with excitement when I heard Hudson and Fantasia singing together.  What a nice move!  The song, \"I'm His Only Woman\" mimics \"The Boy is Mine\" by Brandy and Monica and \"Same Script, Different Cast\" by Whitney Houston and Deborah Cox because all three songs feature two R&B singers and in each song the women are fighting over men.  It's a concept that is being recycled, but, personally, I am entertained by it.  The ladies do a great job together and it is one of the better songs on the album.  \"We Gon' Fight\" is another standout.  The hook and beat are nice; you'll be replaying this one if you invest in this album.  \"Pocketbook\" features Ludacris.  The two of them sound so nice together.  This song uses what made Doug E. Fresh famous, a technique called beatboxing.  I'm glad she stepped outside of her box and did this because it is a good song, namely the chorus.\n\n Jennifer Hudson's voice is sometimes way too strong for R&B.  Her niche would no doubt be gospel music.  However, a lot of her songs are good.  I granted this album 3.5 stars because it is pretty enjoyable, but it is not something I will be listening to on a frequent basis.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"Spotlight\"\n2. \"And I Am Telling You (I'm Not Going)\"\n3. \"We Gon' Fight\"\n4. \"Pocketbook\"\n5. \"I'm His Only Woman\"","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"After hearing a leak of another ARTPOP track, \"Burqa\", I was fairly surprised when \"Applause\" finally arrived.  The two songs are nothing alike, and that just makes me more excited for the full album.  \"Applause\" is, considering Lady Gaga's recent releases, a fairly toned-down pop track that's more in line with her days from The Fame than Born This Way.  It's like it mixes the two styles together.  The result is pretty great, and deserving of the same level of success she's enjoyed since \"Just Dance\" took radio by storm.  The vocals on \"Applause\" hearken back to David Bowie during the verses before exploding into the upbeat chorus.  Short but sweet, the song's frantic beat doesn't let up before abruptly cutting off after a mere 3 and a half minutes.  It's far removed from the 4-5 minute opuses on Born This Way!  While not the strongest single in Gaga's repertoire, \"Applause\" is still worth of its namesake.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"I've been a Sevendust fan ever since I heard Black on the radio.  I've got all their albums, and most of their b sides soundtrack songs, and they haven't released a bad song yet.  Granted some songs are better than others, but overall even the worst Sevendust song is still decent.  This album does continue that trend, and song qualitywise, It does a little better.  My concern with Clint coming back was that the sound would be toned down a lot, kind of like on Seasons, and damned if it wasen't.  I don't know, the sound is just lacking an edge that their previous albums had, except for Seasons.  There aren't really any really heavy songs, not that Sevendust will be confused with being death metal or anything, but they usually have a couple almost fierce songs.  Ok that's probably an exaggeration but I couldn't think of a better word for it.  There are also way too many soft songs for my taste.  Really those are the only complaints I have.\n\nOverall the songs are good.  Although the sound is toned down there are still a few rockers to be found.  There are moments of experamentation which I like.  It's just a solid album.  It's just a shame the sound didn't match the quality of the album.\n\nSplinter is a good example of a song that shows some growth and experamentation, but still rocks, probably the heaviest on the album.  The opening riff reminds me of something either Avenged sevenfold or a power metal band might do.\n\nUnraveling is easily in my top five songs of the year, and a STRONG condender for favorite song of the year.  It's a softer song, definately made for radio, but the lyrics are really good, and the melodies are nice as well.\n\nForever is another rocker, I switched this one and Unraveling cause of all the softer songs by each other.  I love the melodies in the chorus.\n\nLast Breath is kind of similar to Unraveling, but not as good.  Still a solid song though.\n\nKarma is a softer one, with some interesting verses.  The chorus is pretty heavy.\n\nI don't know how to describe Ride Inside.  It has an interesting intro, nice melodies, but nothing really special.\n\nConfessions, another softer one.  There's sort of a pattern here, softer, slightly heavier softer again.  I LOVe the melodies on the chorus.  Kind of poppy a bit and I wouldn't be surprised if this was one of the singles, along with Unraveling.  I'm sure at least one of those songs will be a single.  Another of my favorites of the year.\n\nNowhere, Sort of a rocker.  It's a decent song, but I can't really think of anything that stands out, still a decent song.\n\nHere And Now, another mellow song, nothing all that special here either.  The backing vocals in the chorus are kind of cool.\n\nThe End Is Coming, Starts off with a nice heavy riff, that leads into a faster part, but then as the verse comes up the song gets slower and softer.  It picks back up for the chorus.  It's ok.\n\nBetter place is kind of a mix of soft and heavy.  The verses have both softer and heavier guitars layered together.  There's an alright guitar solo, slower song though, but still a decent one.\n\nStrong And Broken ends the album.  It's probably another of the heaviest songs on the album.  Nice verses, a kind of cool riff.  The chorus is only ok though.\n\nOverall this is an alright album.  It has good song consistancy, as most Sevendust albums do.  I'm sure it'll please the hardcore fans.  I'm just a bit disappointed because I absolutely loved it on the first listen, and my interest has gone down the more I hear it.  Still if you're a fan of the band, definately don't pass it up.","classification":3,"fold":6}

How could they even think this was a good enough to release?\n\nGranted, it was recorded in 1986.  The technology was available to record vocals correctly.  It sounds like they held a microphone up and hoped for the best.\n\nThe reason I gave it two starts vice one is that the song choice was pretty good and the band sounded ok considering.  Again - horrible vocal recordings.  Save your money.","classification":2,"fold":6}
{"text":"When the word got out that Daft Punk would be scoring the sequel to TRON it generated something of a phenomenon- where fans were more excited for a soundtrack than a movie itself.\n\nUnlike the original TRON soundtrack, there's no silliness or cheesy comedy on display here; the ridiculous scherzo is replaced with both a poignant adagio and a nocturne to underscore the higher stakes in this upgrade of the TRON saga.  Orchestrations mixed with techno beats might put off those looking for a pure Daft Punk release, but remember this is a movie score and tracks tend to be scene-specific.  Plotlines and emotional arcs are being explored here; the symphony lends gravitas to the proceedings and it all comes out pretty good. The only real negatives here are that most tracks are pretty short, clocking in between 1  to 2  minutes. The other is that this isn't a complete release- a few tracks are held back for the deluxe version and one is only available directly from iTunes.  How typically Disney...\n\nWendy Carlos' semi-iconic 24-note TRON theme is used both sparingly and excessively; you get heavy doses of it, but only in the tracks at the beginning, middle and end of the cd.  There's a couple of secondary themes at work here, notably a cello rush and sub-tonal pulsing rhythm that are very effective at setting the mood.  The rest of the cuts are peppered with soundscapes that are strikingly similar to the works of Hans Zimmer, Brad Fiedel, and a couple others.\n\nSome Highlights: *Potential Spoilers Alert*\nOverture- Begins with a single extended synth note underscored by cello until a solo trombone breaks in at the 0:25 mark with a couple of solemn two-noters before it blossoms into a reprise of the TRON theme at 0:52.  At 1:35 the synths, string and brass come together (in a pretty rough edit) for another reprise.  A very nice build up, but unfortunately isn't used in the movie.\n\nThe Grid- Used in the film's opening sequence, it starts with a brief plot exposition delivered by Jeff Bridges, supported by a pulsing percussion and the debut of one of the secondary themes- an 8-note pulsing reverb- accompanied by a string version of the theme before ending with a TRON reprise in synth.\n\nRecognizer- Built upon the second major theme- the 8-note cello rush- accompanied by some Zimmer-style bottom and driving sub-tones, it also incorporates an alternate TRON keyboard motif to flesh things out.  Very reminiscent of the themes from 'The Dark Knight'.\n\nRinzler- 8-note sub-tonal intro highlighted by a couple of 4-note crashing percussion sets.  Some eerie synth notes blend into a pulsed rhythm supported by cello.  Synths and rhythm rise in full with a new set of dystopian percussion before falling into a fade out.  A nice introduction for C.L.U.'s enforcer.\n\nThe Game Has Changed- This is the track used in the initial teaser footage and first trailers, and plays during the lightcycle battle.  Starts with the 8-note sub-tonal pulse used in 'Rinzler', it only takes ten seconds for the dystopic drums to appear.  At :20 seconds they crash head on with a violin rush behind them.  Switches to strings and synths until the sub-tones return at 1:13 and the string emerge again, followed by more synth.  This sequence repeats a couple times with some alternate synths and filtering thrown in making for a dark, intriguing mix before ending with the crashing drums.\n\nEnd of Line- The Grid's most popular club, run by Castor.  Shades of Thomas Dolby with the snare and kick synth combo.  Leads into high and mid layered keyboards before adding a couple layers of 7-note synths to carry it.  Add in some flutter and warbling effects and it's not bad.\n\nDerezzed- For the fight sequence inside End Of Line, it's 100% Daft Punk!  Fast, frenzied and completely schizoid- and I love the ending when it goes all off-kilter and spastic... in a good way!  Only thing wrong with it is it's over way too soon at only 1:44.\n\nTRON Legacy End Credits- Built upon repeating layers of 5-note synths over a 4-note looped drum track.  At 1:18 the TRON theme comes in on keyboard.  The third time through the theme it gets fleshed out with part of the orchestra as the synths drop underneath.  Makes for a nice denouement.\n\nThough I'm not a big fan of the franchise this soundtrack has me pumped up to see this flick and I'm looking forward to seeing how it all fits together.  An excellent piece of work.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"This is another terrific bargain from the X5 group offering a great selection of music by Czech composer Antonin Dvorak. It is a truly huge set even by the standards of these \"99 Most Essential\" collections featuring individual composers -- 12 hours and 21 minutes of music, with a full download size of 1.18 GB. Especially at the introductory price of $2.49, this is an outstanding bargain featuring great music, well performed and with only a few exceptions well recorded.\n\nDvorak is as good a place as any to draw an imaginary line dividing \"Romantic\" from \"post-Romantic\" composers -- perhaps especially because he was one of the first major European composers to travel to and spend a significant period of time in America. That act alone has a lot of symbolism for the end of one era in music and culture, and the start of the next. At any rate, he was certainly one of the last great composers of the Romantic period, and this collection is a strong testimony to that.\n\nIt is always possible to argue about what gets included in and left out of these sets. In this case, if I could change things it would be to have a bit less stress on symphonies and a bit more on chamber music. At a minimum, for example, his String Quartet No. 12 (\"American\") definitely belongs among any set of Dvorak's \"greatest hits\". Some piano trios and string quintets would also have been welcome. But that is nit-picking. This is a great collection of great music -- here's a quick run-through by composition type.\n\n* Symphonies -- Nos. 2, 5-9\n\nMore than most composers, Dvorak's symphonies have the strange habit of getting more popular and better received the higher their numbers go. By far his best-known work is Symphony No. 9, \"From the New World\". This is a popular crowd-pleaser that has even gone to the moon (Neil Armstrong brought a recording of it with him). Dvorak said it included influences from American music, but beyond a brief passage that sounds a lot like \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\" and a precious few runs in what may be loosely Native-American style pentatonic, I'm not sure there really is all that much \"New World\" here. Leonard Bernstein once summed it up by saying it was a terrific Old World symphony, which is as good a description as any. This set has a sensitive performance with conductor Alun Francis leading the Berlin Symphony Orchestra -- former East Berlin's response to the Berlin Philharmonic, now known as the Konzerthausorchester Berlin.\n\nThe 7th and 8th Symphonies often score comments from the critics such as \"better than the 9th\". They are both great pieces, performed well by the Gothenburg Symphony and the Canary Islands-based Tenerife Symphony orchestras. An older-sounding recording of the 5th by the Vienna Radio Symphony and a rousing 6th by the Swedish Chamber Orchestra round out the set of symphonies that were published in Dvorak's lifetime.\n\nSymphonies 1-4 were all released posthumously -- No. 2 appears here in another older-sounding version by the Moscow Radio Symphony. The symphonic performances are all very good in my view, although played by less famous orchestras. These will not appear on lists of the all-time great recordings of these works, but they are all well played and satisfying.\n\n* Concertos for Piano and Cello\n\nTwo of Dvorak's three concertos are represented here -- the piano and the cello concertos. The violin concerto is not present. The cello concerto is the best received of the three, and was written late in Dvorak's career, after he heard and enjoyed cello concertos in America. This is a fine performance by soloist Frans Helmerson and the Gothenburg Symphony under Neeme Jarvi.\n\nThe piano concerto is not really regarded as a strong virtuoso work, and gets relatively little play despite being good music. I actually hadn't heard it before getting this set.\n\n* Slavonic Dances, \"Legends\", and other orchestral works\n\nThe set opens with the Carnival Overture -- one of many incidental pieces for symphony orchestra included. It is a complex, well-developed nine-minute work, exciting and lilting in turn. The Malaysian Philharmonic turns in a surprisingly good performance. A number of other single-movement orchestral works are also included, including the Othello Overture, the Scherzo Capriccioso and the nearly half-hour Symphonic Variations.\n\nBoth series of the crowd-pleasing \"Slavonic Dances\" are here -- the Op. 46 and Op. 72 dances. These were originally written for piano four hands, and then orchestrated by Dvorak at the request of his publisher. These are really Dvorak's Czech\/Moravian answer to the \"Hungarian Dances\" of his mentor and supporter Johannes Brahms. They were the pieces that really established Dvorak as an internationally recognized composer, and are performed capably here by the Rheinland-Pfalz State Philharmonic.\n\n\"Legends\" is another early orchestral suite originally written between for piano four hands. The performances here by the Bamberg Symphony under Neeme Jarvi are fine.\n\nThe \"American\" Suite in A major is an orchestration of a piano suite written during Dvorak's three-year stay in the US in 1892-1895. Again, I'm not sure there is really anything particularly American about the work, but it is interesting.\n\nThe Polonaise for Cello and Piano has been orchestrated into the Polonaise for Cello and Orchestra, and a Rondo for Cello and Orchestra is also here, although in one of the technically poorer recordings on the set as the microphones seem poorly positioned. Waldesruhe for Cello and Orchestra is also here and played well, although the cello part is pretty weak in the mix.\n\nThe early, lyrical work Serenade in E Major for strings, for string symphony, is pleasantly performed, although it is definitely not among Dvorak's more powerful works.\n\n* Chamber music\n\nDvorak was huge in chamber music. It is a shame that none of his 14 string quartets or three string quintets is included, as there are some real gems.\n\nDvorak wrote four (surviving) piano trios, and two each of piano quartets and quintets -- of these, only the Piano Quintet No. 2 is here, in a powerful performance by Belgian pianist Roberte Mamou and four (unfortunately) unnamed string players. Information from other sources indicates these players are the great Romanian violinist Silvia Marcovici, French violinist Ami Flammer and violist Gerard Causse, and British cellist Robert Cohen. A shame that these artists are not included in the MP3 metadata for this piece.\n\nThe lilting Terzetto for Two Violins and Viola is the only purely string-based chamber piece here, and I found it interesting because it relies on the viola to handle the \"low\" end, at least making an attempt to play the anchoring role a cello would cover in a quartet. Definitely worth hearing.\n\nCzech players Bohuslav Matousek and Petr Adamec turn in performances sensitive and energetic in turns on works for violin and piano, including the Romantic Pieces for Violin and Piano, the Capriccio for Violin and Piano, the Mazuerk for Violin and Piano, the Violin Sonata, and the Nocturne in B major.\n\nSolo piano works are thin on the ground, although two of the famous Humoresques are here as well as two of the \"Poetic Tone Pictures\". There are also four of Dvorak's Ten Biblical Songs for baritone and piano here -- the only songs present.\n\nThe set has none of Dvorak's choral\/sacred works, or excerpts from any of his 10 operas. I would have welcomed some sacred music, but again nobody is going to be completely satisfied with selections in a collection like this.\n\nThe quality of the recordings (with few exceptions) is at least good, and usually very good to excellent. Bitrates are variable, and average a strong 176-243 Kbps. But only the solo piano works and songs for baritone and piano fall below 200 Kbps. This is likely due to less demanding space requirements to encode single instruments in a variable bitrate MP3, allowing for a lower bitrate without a significant loss in quality. In general, bitrates are in the 220s and 230s.\n\nThis is a monster of a set by a great composer that put out a lot of easily likeable music. Try not to pass it up at the special introductory price, but it will be worthwhile even later on. Highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I'm not a die-hard Killers fan or collector but their last release, Day and Age, caught my attention and now I would consider it to be in my top 10 of all time. Of course I realize Brandon Flowers is only one fourth of that group and I shouldn't hold this release up to the standards of any previous Killers album, but since he literally is the voice that keeps them together I was expecting at least some familiarity on his new solo release, Flamingo, while at the same time trying to keep an open mind to the changes and progressions that would naturally arise with his wider range of artistic freedom. I was ready for anything and really looking forward to this.\n\nBut after several listens, I just cannot get into this record at all. It is such a radical departure from anything I would have expected from Mr. Flowers, not to mention the usually upbeat Stuart Price and the other producers listed, whom I generally do like. I'm not going to use the word \"bad\" here because it most certainly is not. In fact lyrically it's very thoughtful and provocative and he really does come off as a wonderful poet in his own right with a knack for Springsteen-esque \"story songs.\" However, the music is so dull and minimal that it kind of negates the point of even trying to make a full-length song out of it at all, as opposed to maybe just a spoken word piece. There are no hooks or catchy melodies present and several tracks have a non-structural, folksy air about them that might make one wonder if he's making this up as he goes along. Nothing pops out at you as being especially noteworthy and it sounds unfinished, hence no good guesses about possible future, radio-friendly singles. Luckily I purchased the 14-track deluxe edition because the four bonus songs are actually quite good and even a little catchy (I dare you not to tap your toes to \"Clock Was Ticking\") but by track 11, it's too little, too late. I can only imagine the disappointment I would have felt had I got the standard 10-track edition.\n\nIn closing, it's very evident Flowers is a creative soul, but he sounds oddly restrained and Flamingo comes off as just a preliminary sketch of the album he REALLY wanted to make. I tried my best to abandon all expectations and was still underwhelmed, so I cannot in good conscience recommend this to major Killers fans. Even those with a casual interest may find it uneven. Like I said, I'm not trying to compare the old with the new. I just think in and of itself it's a bit bland, and dare I say it, boring.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"Rich Girl, which was released in 1977, became Hall and Oates first number one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and in a sense launched them into recognition as something a little different, sort of a pop Rhythm and Blues style into a market that was heavily going Disco and Funk. I was a senior that year and it was everywhere. Soon after that they flooded the market with \"Sarah Smile\" which all of us were humming. Love it or hate it, Hall and Oates were masters in their pop style and the music is still fun today.

{"text":"Generally judged as one of the better psychedelic revival bands, Temples tosses its debut in the ring.  Electric twelve-strings and trippy lyrics dapple Temples walls, and a cathedral of reverb shovels a shadow of gauze atop the bands sunny, garage-rock blast.  While the foggy production keeps any one of Temples 60s\/90s retro mix from standing out, a heavy Revolver-period Beatles influence is evident, as the opener Shelter Song echoes Tomorrow Never Knows, right down to the boxy snare.  However, Temples is not a Dukes of Stratosphear, wherein every tie-dyed reference is a tongue-in-cheek overstatement.  Instead, theres a reverence for its forebears, as much of Sun Structures suggests to what Journey to the Center of the Mind might have evolved, had Amboy Dukes founder Ted Nugent not gone wango-tangoing off the right-wing rails.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"There is no question that today's music has mostly been a poor set of singers that can't hold a tune where instead they can drive a hole into your heart. But for some legends, they can make great music last beyond a lifetime. Billy Joel is one of those artists. While it has been more than 20 years since he released his last pop album, River Of Dreams, his songs still stand beyond the test of time. He had so much going for him back in the 80's. He became a father when his daughter Alexa Ray was born, and he tied the knot the second time with Christie Brinkley. But he also had so many great concerts he had performed in the world. Billy had performed in Yankee Stadium as the first major pop act to perform at the house that Ruth built, and he became one of the most profiled artists to have ever graced the stage in the former Soviet Union. But nevertheless, Billy delivered with a eye-opening experience that set the world on fire.\n\nOriginally released as Kohuept in the late 80's, A Matter Of Trust: The Bridge To Russia is a great importance and brilliant concert into what made Billy Joel a distinctive legend. While he was on tour to support his record The Bridge, he made a set of concert in the former Soviet Union to perform in front of Soviet audiences that stood the test of time, and inspired one of Joel's most distinctive songs later on Lenningrad. The concert still shows why the Piano Man has been so classic after all this time. While Billy Joel wasn't the first U.S. performer to play the Superpower, that belonged to John Denver, but Billy was the most important to deliver. The songs still sound great and remain as important and classic as they were when they were released over 25 years ago. Songs like Piano Man, Uptown Girl and Allentown are very well remastered here, as well as songs that still stand, but haven't been released before like a rehearsal cut of New York State Of Mind, and songs like Allentown and She's Always A Woman which haven't released before on a live album. The songs sound great, and a great trip back in time to when music really had a thumbprint of changing the world, something today's artists really haven't even scratched the surface on.\n\nThere are some artists who have made some great live albums in the 80's. Elton John had Live In Australia with The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, and Billy Joel's A Matter Of Trust: The Bridge To Russia is one of those great records. If you have never, ever had heard the classic Piano Man's classic songs before, than you should get a good listen to this album. If you have bought Kohuept when it came out in the 80's, you'll absolutely love A Matter Of Trust: The Bridge To Russia. Billy Joel has always been a fantastic entertainer, and this is a blueprint of what made him so classic for all this time.\n\nAlbum Cover: B\n\nSongs: B+\n\nRemastering: B 1\/2+\n\nPrice: B+\n\nOverall: B 1\/2+","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"When Modest Mouse hit the scene with this song a few years ago, it took awhile for the modern rock crowd to accept originality and great riffs in their music. In fact, it probably wouldn't have hit #1 if it hadn't been for Nickelback being in the studio with their best-seller. But when they finally came around to the song, they saw it for what it was, an original rock piece that would go down as a rock classic from the 2000's, and a riff that would go down in history as the bumper-music for many a radio program.\n\nRight off the bat, you get those classic rock riffs that just scream awesome with every note. They're memorable, rockin', and most importantly, original. The verses continue the trend with the catchiness and the trademark Modest Mouse style. It might not make the most sense at first, but it all blends in one amazing song. And even though those trademark Modest Mouse vocals are incredibly hard to work-around usually, in this song they're perfect. Nope, original songs require original vocals. No Nickelback notes are allowed here.\n\nOverall, this is going to be one of those songs that goes down in those Rolling Stone best of music books. It's original in every manner, and it has great riffs and chords to keep you rockin' through the night. Modest Mouse's best by a mile, and it's nice to know there's still classic rock ruling the radio waves.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Well if you would look at all the horrible releases that's came out of Cash Money\/YMCMB like<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/I-Am-Not-a-Human-Being-II\/dp\/B00BDZV9M4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">I Am Not a Human Being II<\/a>, and<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Hotel-California\/dp\/B00BDZV7DA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hotel California<\/a>, you would think that this compilation would have little to offer. If you approach this album with the mind state of knowing what you are going to get, average rhymes over some of the best beats that money can buy (seriously if you bought this album expecting to hear intelligent lyrics then I don't know what to say). Now that YMCMB is signing any and everyone becoming more than a powerhouse label, Brian Williams aka Birdman aka Baby aka B-32 (took that one way back) decided to do was to showcase what everyone can do on this compilation while playing the role of Diddy on the album (excessive talking on tracks). While there is nothing that stands out too much, he puts together something decent for the summer.\n\nTrue enough, formal rival Mystikal now signed to the label starts off the album (you remember \"Drag 'Em In The River\"...you and that song are probably the same age lol). Here he sounds refreshed as he was during his No Limit days. \"Million Dollar\" with Detail and Future is average. Detail sounds like a Drake wannabe. \"Tapout\"  is the lead single of this album. The song is your obvious formulaic style with half decent lyrics and your R&B\/rapper style person on the hook. In this case is Future. \"We Been On\" is actually kind of good. The beat and R. Kelly providing a nice hook to the song is the reason why it works. \"Dreams Come True\" has a nice beat, but no one on that track says anything work remembering, and the fact Yo Gotti was only on the hook was a waste of a guest appearance. Rick Ross gets a solo song \"50 Plates\" is nothing special either. \"Bigger Than Life\" has a nice hook by Chris Brown. Tyga spits an ok verse, but Birdman's is garbage, and Wayne's kind of good. \"100 Favors\" is the oddest colab with Detail, Birdman, and Kendrick Lamar (Note to K. Dot: If you are going to mention all those rappers name in that wonderful verse, the very least you could have done is colab with someone on a lever WAY lower than them). You can guess how that turns out. \"Everyday\" featuring Birdman, Cory Gunz, Busta Rhymes, and Mystikal is one of the good tracks here. The fact that Busta and Mystikal together on a song gives us a nostalgic feel of their colabs back in the late 90's. \"Burn This House\" featuring Detail singing is garbage. Even worse \"Panties To The Side\" is by far the worst song on here. \"Angel\" is also a bad sex song. \"Sunshine\" is completely awkward, although I do enjoy Caskey's presence on the song (he has a good mixtape that came out this year). T.I. makes a strong appearance on \"Have It Your Way\". \"Paint Tha Town\" featuring Birdman, The Game, and Lil Wayne is pretty solid surprisingly. \"Fly Rich\" ends the album.\n\nOverall, Rich Gang is average. As said before the beats here are great. The hooks too are not bad. If you are the kind of person who listens rather than just hears lyrics in songs, avoid this album. There are some shiny spots here and there, but the album is more suited for the club style atmosphere. Like many summer compilations such as<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ryde-Or-Die-Compilation-1\/dp\/B00000IFNQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ryde Or Die Compilation 1<\/a>and<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Irv-Gotti-Presents-The-Inc\/dp\/B000068TKH\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Irv Gotti Presents The Inc.<\/a>there is room for many hit singles but no substance.

{"text":"When the word got out that Daft Punk would be scoring the sequel to TRON it generated something of a phenomenon- where fans were more excited for a soundtrack than a movie itself.\n\nUnlike the original TRON soundtrack, there's no silliness or cheesy comedy on display here; the ridiculous scherzo is replaced with both a poignant adagio and a nocturne to underscore the higher stakes in this upgrade to the TRON saga. Orchestrations mixed with techno beats might put off those looking for a pure Daft Punk release, but remember this is a movie score and tracks will be scene-specific and somewhat repetitive in their themes. Plotlines and emotional arcs are being explored here; the symphony lends gravitas to the proceedings and it all comes out pretty good. The only real negatives here are that most tracks are pretty short, clocking in between 1  to 2  minutes. The other is that this isn't a complete release- a few tracks are held back for the deluxe version and one is only available directly from iTunes. How typically Disney...\n\nWendy Carlos' semi-iconic 24-note TRON theme is used both sparingly and excessively; you get heavy doses of it, but only in the tracks at the beginning, middle and end of the cd. There's also a couple of secondary themes at work here, notably a cello rush and sub-tonal pulsing rhythm that are very effective at setting the mood. The rest of the cuts are peppered with soundscapes that are strikingly similar to Hans Zimmer, Brad Fiedel, and a couple others. But after having seen the flick, I can say it does all fit very well.\n\nSome Highlights: *Potential Spoilers*\n\nOverture- Begins with a single extended synth note underscored by cello until a solo trombone breaks in at the 0:25 mark with a couple of solemn two-noters before it blossoms into a reprise of the TRON theme at 0:52. At 1:35 the synths, string and brass come together (in a pretty rough edit) for another reprise. A very nice build up, but it doesn't appear in the film.\n\nThe Grid- Used for the movie's opening sequence, it starts with a brief plot exposition delivered by Jeff Bridges, supported by a pulsing percussion and the debut of one of the secondary themes- an 8-note pulsing reverb- accompanied by a string version of the theme before ending with a TRON reprise in synth.\n\nRecognizer- Named for the police program that sends Sam Flynn and other captured programs to the arena games.  Built upon the second major theme- the 8-note cello rush- accompanied by some Zimmer-style bottom and driving sub-tones, it also incorporates an alternate TRON keyboard motif to flesh things out. Very reminiscent of the themes from 'The Dark Knight'.\n\nRinzler- 8-note sub-tonal intro highlighted by a couple of 4-note crashing percussion sets. Some eerie synth notes blend into a pulsed rhythm supported by cello. Synths and rhythm rise in full with a new set of dystopian percussion before falling into a fade out.  A nice intro for C.L.U.'s enigmatic enforcer.\n\nThe Game Has Changed- Plays during this film's version of the iconic- and very well done- lightcycle battle, it's also the track used in the initial teaser footage and first trailers. Starts with the 8-note sub-tonal pulse used in 'Rinzler', it only takes ten seconds for the dystopic drums to appear. At :20 seconds they crash head on with a violin rush behind them. Switches to strings and synths until the sub-tones return at 1:13 and the string emerge again, followed by more synth. This sequence repeats a couple times with some alternate synths and filtering thrown in making for a dark, intriguing mix before ending with the crashing drums.\n\nEnd of Line- Welcome to the most exclusive club in The Grid.  Shades of Thomas Dolby with the snare and kick synth combo. Leads into high and mid layered keyboards before adding a couple layers of 7-note synths to carry it. Add in some flutter and warbling effects and it's not bad.\n\nDerezzed- Used for the smackdown fight scene inside the End of Line Club between the heroes and some goons- it's 100% Daft Punk! Fast, frenzied and completely schizoid- and I love the ending when it goes all off-kilter and spastic... in a good way! Only thing wrong with it is it's over way too soon at only 1:44.\n\nTRON Legacy End Credits- Built upon repeating layers of 5-note synths over a 4-note looped drum track. At 1:18 the TRON theme comes in on keyboard. The third time through the theme it gets fleshed out with part of the orchestra as the synths drop underneath. Makes for a nice denouement.\n\nThough I'm not a big fan of the franchise this soundtrack had me pumped up to see this flick and it's a flawless complement to the movie. An excellent piece of work.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Produced by The E Street Bands Steven Van Zandt, this CD is nothing but a good time!  The irony in the album title is that that Love is a well-known shadow singer, having sung backups and harmonies for an array of artists including Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Sonny & Cher, Dionne Warwick, The Beach Boys, and even U2.  Her Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home) is a signature holiday staple, which she reprises each year in a NYC holiday show.  She appeared in 20 Feet from Stardom, the 2013 documentary on the lives of backup singers to the stars.  Love turns 76 this year [2017], and, if this album is any indication, shes about as far from a rocker and a shawl as one can get.  Among the Believers (a Van Zandt original) bangs open the doors, and 13 tracks later, Jesus Is the Rock (That Keeps Me Rollin) (another Van Zandt rant) takes the party home with an all-out gospel shout.  In between, new songs by Linda Perry, Elvis Costello, Jimmy Webb, Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil, and Bruce Springsteen give Love fresh material to make all her own.  The roots of rock and R&B lace through every song on the disc, giving new power to Loves girl-group origins.  But the hands-down highlight is Loves rip through River Deep, Mountain High, which should come with a warning  it will inspire impromptu air-mic moves that could be downright embarrassing, depending on where you hear this.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Love this CD.  Nancy has always, ALWAYS been one of my favorites and this CD is just one more excuse to love her.  I first fell in love with her voice in the seventies.  She made quite a few albums that to me were way ahead of her time. Love, Life and Harmony being one of them.  (Wish they would release that on CD format and also This Mothers Daughter). As Nancy advances toward her September years her voice has mellowed, gotten richer and even more beautiful. Her newer CD RSVP is another fine example of her later talent.  On this CD, the song \"Love I Found You\" is the stunner on this set.  As I stated all the songs are first rate and she handles them as the pro she is but \"Love I Foud You\" will live inside of you long after the CD has been switched off. If you are new to Nancy this is a great CD to begin with and I can promise you this, once you have tasted of her talents, You will be back for more.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Joanna Newsom is one of the great indie musicians of our time -- just look at last year's \"Ys,\" a sprawling masterpiece of freakfolk.\n\nAnd after the solemnities of \"Ys,\" apparently Newsom has decided to go a bit more lighthearted. \"Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band\" is an unpretentious little EP, with some new songs and new takes on older songs -- a fun little treat.\n\nIt opens with the strong folky chords of \"Colleen,\" a slice of Celtic-flavoured balladry that trickles through an oddball melody. \"I tell it as I best know how,\" croons Newsom in her crazy-fairy voice. \"Pick me up and toss me round\/I lost my shoes and tore my best gown...\"\n\nShe then follows it up with new versions of two older songs: the gentle haunting reimagining of \"Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie,\" and a full-band version of \"Cosmia,\" which seems nicely fleshed-out and polished.\n\nAfter to the legendary grandeur of \"Ys,\" this little EP seems relaxed and laid-back, as if Newsom and her band had sauntered into a coffee shop and done an impromptu set. They're done with an ear for fun, but that doesn't take the delicate, appealing edge from the music.\n\nHer twangly, delicate harp is matched up with some decent banjo tunes, and what sounds like some soft drums, all mingled together. In \"Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie,\" we mostly just get gentle strums from the harp. And over it all is Newsom's creaky, meandering vocals, wandering through the melody like a sleepy fairy.\n\nOne new song and two reworkings, but \"Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band\" is stil worth getting for anyone who likes eerie, weird little folk songs.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"While this marks the second remastering and repackaging of Santana's debut, this two-disc set is worth the price of admission.  Originally released in August of 1969,the same month as their stunning performance at Woodstock, Santana released one of the strongest albums of their thirty-year-plus career. But while their debut was a wonderful collection of terrific songs--\"Evil Ways, \"Jingo,\" \"Persuasion\"--they were an even better live band.\n\nThe 1998 reissue featured three of their songs from Woodstock, including the 11:49 gem \"Soul Sacrifice.\"  This 2004 Legacy edition includes their entire Woodstock set (with the exception of \"Evil Ways\"), adding four more songs:  \"Waiting,\" \"You Just Don't Care, \"Jingo\" and \"Persuasion.\"\n\nAdditional material on the bonus disc are studio sessions of songs like \"Soul Sacrifice\" and \"\"Persuasion\" that were recorded before drummer Michael Shrieve and percussionist Joe Areas were brought into the band, revealing compelling but alternate performances of these songs.\n\nEven if you already own the 1998 remaster, this is the definitive release.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED","classification":5,"fold":6}
{"text":"This volume in the series is very unique  in that it mixes a soundboard tape with an high quality audience tape recorded by Robert Wagner to create a matrix mix. Matrix mixes have been around a while but this is the first official Grateful Dead archive release to do this.\n\nThe Grateful Dead had a strong year in 1980. They introduced several new songs at the beginning of the year, celebrated their 15th Anniversary while  playing acoustic sets in September and October. These acoustic sets also saw the return of songs that had been put away for a while. The band was also recording shows that would make two live two l.p. set releases the next year.\n\nThis show marks the fourth show since the Radio City Music Hall show. The band's mini November tour started on the 26 and by the time the 30th rolled around, the band was on a roll.\n\nThe first set starts with Feel Like A Stranger and it takes a few adjustments to get everything dialed in just exactly right. That doesn't stop the band from building this to a high octane jam. Loser starts with a nice tempo and builds to a cool finish. Cassidy is short and well played but the jams are only hinted at during this era. Ramble On Rose is stretched out nicely with Jerry firing it up during the solos. Little Red Rooster gives Bob a chance to show off his blues chops. It's also nice to hear Brent's electric piano up in the mix which doesn't always happen. Next up, a real treat in the first electric Bird Song since September 1973. Bird Song had been brought back in the acoustic sets but this was it in it's new arrangement for the first time in an electric set. The Me And My Uncle->Big River moves along at a nice clip while It Must Have Been The Roses is sweetly played. It's another song that was brought back during the acoustic sets. The first set ends with hot versions of Lost Sailor->Saint Of Circumstance->Deal.\n\nThe second set begins with a hot Scarlet->Fire that, while not a super long version, is still a standout. Samson rocks hard and the ballad Ship Of Fools is very well done. The long second set jam starts with a 15 minute plus Playing In The Band that goes to some cool places before drifting into the Drums->Space segment. I guess that there are some out there that don't like Drums->Space segments but I do. Out of Space, we get a mellow The Wheel and a pretty China Doll. Bob rocks the set to a close with a Chuck Berry medley while Uncle John's Band is a great encore. All in all, everybody is on and it was a very good night for everyone.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I'm not surprised that there are not many reviews here for Sia-she's not really mainstream chart toppingly known though her voice has been heard if you're a fan of Sex and the City as she provided the vocals for Zero 7's In the Waiting Line. Most recently her song You've Changed was played during a scene in the Vampire Diaries. Sia also collaborated with Christina Aguilera's least successful album Bionic which is unfortunate because Sia wrote her fine songs: Birds of Prey, I Am, You Lost Me, and All I Need. Sia is still waiting for her breakthrough here in the States.\n1. The Fight-Just as catchy and upbeat as You've Changed-5\/5\n2. Clap Your Hands-The second single I believe and an enjoyable track 4.5\/5\n3. Stop Trying-Sounds kind of school girlish but I'm sure anyone can relate. 4\/5\n4. You've Changed-One of Sia's best tracks ever. 5\/5\n5. Be Good to Me-Need your Sia soul ballad fix-this track should please. 4.5\/5\n6. Bring Night-Another great fun track in the same style as The Fight and You've Changed 4\/5\n7. Hurting Me Now-Heavy track title but still upbeat and Sia coos out the lyrics. 5\/5\n8. Never Gonna Leave Me-Great upbeat track-sounds like vintage Gwen Stefani. 4.5\/5\n9. Cloud-One of the folkier tracks-vintage Sia beauty. 4.5\/5\n10. I'm in Here-Sia's gorgeous rich vocals enchant in this melancholy track. 4\/5\n11. The Co-Dependent-Mid-tempo track-4\/5\n12. Big Girl Little Girl-One of my faves on the whole album-5\/5\n13. Of Father-A Madonna track but I'm not a huge fan of her but I like Sia's take on this track. 4\/5\n14. Gorgeous stripped down version-very enjoyable.\nA must own album imo.

Clearly the music scene had changed immensely from their previous smash hit release \"Empire\", and yet Queensryche went is a direction of their own--not following the trends of the times.  And yet, this effort falls a bit flat in my estimation.  Maybe I am just like others who are fans of \"Empire\" and the epic \"Operation Mindcrime\" and shouldn't expect the band to remain the same.  Nonetheless, the catchiness of previous efforts is clearly lacking.  The song \"Disconnected\", which actually did make it to rock radio for a brief stint, sums up this album perfectly for me.  The first single released, \"I am I\" is one of the better tracks.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"Bad news first: \"You Don't Love Me\" is a disappointment, and a big one at that. I understand you can't expect a bunch of guys who are a combined twenty billion hundred million thousand whatever years old at that point to, in the immortal words of either Franz Kafka or George Clinton (not sure which one), \"tear the roof off the sucker\" like they used to do back in \"the day\" (no, not that day, the other day), but it's still kind of stoic and boring. Now, the good news: everything else is far better. Especially when the group just jams - \"Back Where It All Begins\", for instance, might even be better than the studio version. And you know how they always slightly vary \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\" when they play it live? Well, here's it's all acoustic! And it's sweet! Especially when it comes to the soloing. Now, here's a proposal for a bill that should be signed into federal law: all bands must record and release at least one song with an acoustic guitar solo. Hey, I'd vote for it. Oh, and there's a bass solo! I mean, how cool is that? And \"The Same Thing\" has some fantastic heavy blues licks - it's about the heaviest the group has ever gotten, in fact. Their Bo Diddley tribute \"Nobody to Run with\" (one of the four songs from Where It All Begins, along with \"Back Where It All Begins\", \"Soulshine\" and \"Sailin' 'Cross the Devil's Sea\" - all three are awesome) is good fun, as it was on the studio version. And they save (arguably) the best for last with \"Jessica\", with some slight shifts in tempo that give it an epic feel, as well as the usual great guitars that this incarnation of the band has in spades. It won a Grammy, and I understand why. It might even be better than the classic original. But that's a tough call. Oh, and look for the \"There Is a Mountain\" quote. Think they were feeling nostalgic? This is by far the best of the two \"Evening With\" sets, though both are fantastic - it easily ranks up there with the classic live albums of yore.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Im charmed to have found out about Ghost Town by Adam Lambert due to finding out about it in one of my e-mails (Im a voluntary subscriber to his e-mail list). Anyhow, this single of Ghost Town by Adam Lambert is not to be confused with Madonnas Ghost Town song (which is also good). Madonnas Ghost Town anthem deals with true love between two people regardless of external circumstances that would test even the strongest couples (such as financial tests, what is happening in their external world etc). Adam Lamberts Ghost Town plays with the idea of his heart being like a ghost town and blends the theme of western themed music, hints of rock, as well as dance with original results. For this reason, I would recommend Ghost Town by Adam Lambert for those who are open-minded towards music mashups and music artists who like to experiment with their music.","classification":5,"fold":6}

There's some ballads, \"Love and My Best Friend\", \"Forever Yours\", etc. Other good tracks include \"Don't Mess Up This Good Thing\", \"The Magic Is Working\" and \"Come Give Your Love To Me\".

Once again, I completely understand that this song may mean something else. However, my interpretation of the song appears to be an empowering message of a man or woman picking themselves back up and pursuing their goals\/dreams even in the face of encountering strong judgement\/opposition from others and\/or adversity that can sometimes arise in the game of life. As mentioned before, \"Roar\" is an ideal pick for someone who enjoys \"Firework\" and\/or music tunes of empowerment.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I will admit that I was a strange kid in high school, but I do think that I had pretty good, if a little bit `mature,' tastes. Anyway, one day, I was flipping the channels, and I heard the beginning chords of this song. I, to be honest, didn't recognize the guy playing it. He was old, tall, lanky, and bald. But what a song it was. I was pretty overwhelmed by the poetry of the song (and how it renews itself--when I saw the attacks on the Twin Towers on 9\/11, my mind immediately heard that line from the song \"sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground\"), by the tragedy and love that shine throughout it (whose life hasn't been touched by fire and rain?), by the simple beauty of the melody, and by the performer's intensity as he sang it. Even if I was a stupid high school kid, I could recognize the song's sublimity.\n\nLater, I realized that the performance was at James Taylor's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction. I've never seen that performance since then, but I still remember it, and it did a lot to shape my tastes ever since. I did buy pretty well all of Taylor's early albums and still listen to them occasionally (they are fantastic--a lot of the more obscure songs are the very best). But Taylor prepared me to listen to the great music of some of the neo-folk talents writing and performing music right now (i.e. Mumford and Sons and, especially, The Avett Brothers, who come from Taylor's beloved North Carolina). So, this is still a wonderful song that has been meaningful to me for well over a decade.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"\"Seeds\" is the first album from TV On The Radio since the death of bassist Gerard Smith from lung cancer, and according to Tunde Adebimpe, their best yet. What they unfurl here are unfussy song structures largely giving up their charm early on, unlike the more complex and meandering path taken on previous albums, and it's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nThe band carries on rather optimistically with lead singer Tunde Adebimpe singing \"Rain comes down like it always does, this time I've got seeds on ground\" on the moody title track \"Seeds\", and \"Everything's going to be okay I keep telling myself, don't worry be happy\" on the slowly shuffling \"Trouble\" with atmospheric strings and soothing harmonies. With that, they declare their intention to forge ahead.\n\nHow much do I love you?\" he sings urgently against a wall of cascading \"aaahs\", gently buzzing synths and trilling guitars on opening track \"Quartz\" conjuring a rather reverential feel. Lead single \"Happy Idiot\" finds Adebimpe declaring ignorance to be bliss in a relationship over galloping beats and angular riffs, catchy and anthemic. Slowing things down is the blissful soul of \"Test Pilot\" with Adebimpe shifting from his regular tenor to falsetto in the blink of an eye, while \"Love Stained\" finds him singing in a creamy croon against a gentle tempo-shifting backdrop.\n\n\"Ride\" has a solemn two minute-long piano overture before morphing into a widescreen rocker Springsteen would kill for. \"Right Now\" is a twitchy dance rocker and is also incredibly catchy. Following are a pair of punk rock-inflected numbers; \"Winter\" which is fuzzy and skeletal and reminds me of R.E.M, while the raucous \"Lazerray\" occupies the more frenzied end of the spectrum.\n\nThe album has a well rounded sound, and despite the immediacy of the songs still manages to give up more with each listen. A welcome and inventive return from a place of pain and loss.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"This album deserves nothing less than 5 stars. I was little skeptical with their new one because King of Limbs while it had some stellar songs, it was very short and didn't really hit me the way Radiohead albums do. This to me sounds like all their best characteristics combined though. It's hard to not compare it to their prior albums because at times it invokes the feeling of \"OK Computer\", the ambience and exploratory nature of \"Kid A\/Amnesiac\", to a lesser extent \"In Rainbows\", and surprisingly I can hear the best aspects of \"Hail to the Thief\" in some places. Radiohead is a band that constantly evolves or experiments to prevent from getting stale but this isn't just another solid Radiohead album though. I would put this amongst their best albums; I've been a fan since the mid-90's to now and when I heard this the whole way through I was just taken aback at how complex, beautiful, and amazing \"A Moon Shaped Pool\" is. It's not a cookie cutter affair of trying to recapture old glory or just sounding like they've run out of ideas, it's the exact opposite. The studio version of \"True Love Waits\" is just angelic for lack of better words. The band is in top form, this is the best I've heard Thom Yorke's voice in years (or at least the best utilized) and the rest of the band is in top form creatively and with their musicianship. Having said all that, fans expecting to hear loud sonic electric guitar blaring won't find that here but the songs off the albums are Radiohead matured and maybe not outdoing themselves but coming very close in my opinion. If you're looking for the blazing guitar and heavy dynamics you'll be disappointed but really, I can'tpicture a fan of the band NOT liking this. All fans buy for sure and fans of alternative in the vein of Bjork and other eclectic artists and groups at least listen to samples. A+","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"So you want a Beatles greatest hits album. You see two old and one new compilations on the racks -- the much toted BEATLES 1 or the RED and BLUE ALBUMS respectively. Reasoning it out, you see both are double discs whereas BEATLES 1 is only a single disc. You want to know the sad part? BEATLES 1 is longer than both individually. Why? Because they want to stick to the original format supposedly. Yeah, whatever. I think its just to make more money off poor unsuspecting Beatles fans or people looking for an introduction to the greatest band in rock'n'roll history (you mean there are actually people who don't know The Beatles' entire body of work by heart?? For shame!) Both of them clock in about 70 minutes, whereas BEATLES 1 clocks in at just under 80 minutes. Either they need to do one of two things:\n\n1. Expand the RED and BLUE albums to actual double albums and slap about 30 more songs to each collection (the White Album is woefully underrepresented, whereas seven of Magical Mystery Tour's 11 songs are on there).\n\n2. Add 4 or 5 songs to each respectively, getting it as close to 80 minutes as you can, and slap them onto a double disc set. That way instead of buying 4 discs when only two are needed you get two discs. The only problem here that will undoubtedly crop up is the tendency to slaughter the cover art on Beatles records, and these make nice contrasting pictures, although the Red is from PLEASE PLEASE ME.\n\nAs far as the music goes, so much has been written about The Beatles what more is there to say.

{"text":"Prime Cuts: Not Loving You, Therapy, Whole Damn Year\n\n\"The London Sessions\" is Mary J. Blige's cross-continental affair.  Incarnating the adage that the grass is greener on the other side, Blige has traveled across the pond, lived in London, partnered with the best of the Brit soul lovers and now we have \"The London Sessions.\"  Part of the reason why Blige has gone over to England for inspiration is because she knows that R&B music in the US is in dire straits.  Gone are the days when her albums could move 2 to 3 million copies. Gone are the times when Blige could rule the charts with an iron fists with hits such as \"Not Gon' Cry,\" \"Real Love,\" \"Family Affair\" and \"Be Without You.\"  In fact, it has been almost a decade since Blige last had a Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 hit.  And you have to go back 5 years to find Blige's last top 10 Billboard R&B song.  Though Blige has still been releasing records by the clockwork, her last couple of non-seasonal albums, \"My Life II\" and \"Think Like a Man Too\" tanked without any ripple.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Jimi Hendrix who left the States to find a band in the 60s.  Blige has decided to re-invent herself with her first foray across the Atlantic.  On \"The London Sessions,\" save for a track with US's producer Rodney Jerkins, she has collaborated with some of UK's young and upcoming musicians, including Sam Smith, Disclosure, Emeli Sande, Eg White, and Jimmy Napes.  As a result, Blige sounds rejuvenated and focused.  But the main difference is not so much with the sound or the production quirks.  Rather, what sets \"The London Sessions\" apart from the ton of anonymous sounding records that has cluttered the US R&B scene is that the songs are melodious again.  Just like you can sing along with Blige's earlier hits such as \"No More Drama\" or \"Give Me You\" or \"Love is All We Need,\" many of these songs are melodiously superior.\n\n\"The London Sessions\" can be equally divided between soulful ballads as well as Blige's foray into UK dance music.  In the former category, the gem has to be \"Not Loving You,\" co-written by Sam Smith and James Napier.  Featuring just a piano, finger snaps and Blige's voice, \"Not Loving You\" brings to mind some of the best ballads of the 90s quipped with a sturdy melodic line.  This means it's not one of those coffee shop ballads that winds and winds without ever reaching its destination, \"Not Loving You\" makes a statement and hits one right at the melodic bull's eye.  Another Sam Smith creation is \"Therapy.\"  Finding its hook in a litany of soul-searching questions, \"Therapy\" is a modern jeep funk soul jam littered with some \"doo-wop\" snaps.  \"Whole Damn Year\" finds Blige in vocal command, something that has been missing on her Christmas album released last year.  In that album, Blige sounds like she was a guest vocalist of a David Foster-helmed album. With \"Whole Damn Year\" Blige proves that she owns the song and she can belt it out to prove it.\n\nWhen she delves into the dance tracks, the results are a tad less even.  Recalling Whitney Houston when she recorded a disco-version of \"A Song for You,\" Blige shows the same class and control when she sings \"Nobody But You.\" Disclosure are to be congratulated for producing \"Right Now.\"  Never allowing Blige's dynamic vocals to be buried by the electronic beeps, \"Right Now\" is tastefully hip as well as reverent.  Rodney Jerkins aka Darkchild is emblematic of what's wrong with today's R&B music. Co-written by Jerkins, \"Loving You\" is just a smorgasbord of beats and notes without much of a clear crafted melodic blueprint.  And with the prevalence of electronica that drives many of the up tempos here, one misses the more soulful R&B side of Blige from her \"No More Drama\" and \"My Life\" days.\n\nIn short, \"The London Sessions\" is a much needed recess for Blige.  In effort to breathe new life to her corpus of work, this album (though not perfect) is much needed.  And finally, it's nice to be able to single along with Blige again.","classification":4,"fold":6}

Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you payed for it, its all leagle, and it's yours, for like EVER. :D\nIn my own PERSONAL opinion I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND you download songs, and buy songs from Amazon.com verses buying it on iTunes. c:","classification":5,"fold":6}

Looking at the tracklist you will notice that the song selections were indeed radio hits and one would think that is the case.  But actually, the soul reason for this compilation was that Courtney Love thought the song \"You Know You're Right\" was too good to put on the boxset to get lost with a bunch of poor sounding demos.  She was right, because indeed it is now a hit in it's own right.  It was also a chance to include the cancelled Scott Litt mix of the 1994 \"Pennyroyal Tea\" single that was planned shortly before Kurt's death.  I do wish they'd have included the studio version of \"All Apologies\" but again, I can't complain because this was not intended to be a proper hits collection.  Buy it even if only for \"You Know You're Right.\"  You won't regret it!!!","classification":5,"fold":6}

While the verses and most of the hooks are excellent, the music isn't terribly memorable. It does have a nice throwback vibe, but none of the tracks really stick as they should. They also all seem to be right around the same tempo, which can make the record feel a little monotonous.\nMake no mistake about it though: UNCOMFORTABLE is an excellent album.

{"text":"Prime Cuts: Jesus Saves, Solid Rock (with Jamie Grace), Fill Me Up\n\nOn her preceding debut studio \"Grace,\" we met Cobbs.  A Spirit-imbued worshipper brimming with a holy passion bursting at the seams, we were awed by how she belted out worship sizzlers such as \"For Your Glory,\" \"Grace,\" and \"Break Every Chain.\"  But somehow her energetic verve had been circumscribed on her debut studio album.  Now, with \"One Place Live,\" we find Cobbs uncaged as she delivers what is over an hour's worth of dynamic worship.  Here she rips and roars with a holy abandonment.  Here she soothes and stings with her Godly Scripture-soaked words.  And here she rattles and shatters inviting us into a Spirit-led experience.  Recorded live at Redemption Church in Greenville, South Carolina, with thousands of worshippers in attendance, \"One Place Live\" is signature Tasha Cobbs - replete with passionate, heart-tugging songs that instantly infuse the spirit.\n\nTasha Cobbs is one of the breakout stars of the Gospel music industry. Her #1 national debut, \"Grace,\" remains at the top of Billboard's Gospel Albums chart two years after it was released. That album netted Cobbs a Grammy Award, three Dove Awards and three Stellar Gospel Music Awards. Cobbs encompasses everything that makes a Gospel artist influential and relevant both inside and outside the four walls of the church: purity of heart; a singular, God-focused passion for ministry; and an unwavering commitment to musical excellence.  \"One Place Live,\" her much anticipated follow-up, is produced by Vashawn Mitchell.  It is already causing waves on radio as lead single \"Jesus Saves\" is already a #1 smash.\n\nCobbs starts off well with \"Immediately;\" a joy-saturated praise anthem with lots of singalong segments, choir directors would do well to incorporate it into their repertoire.  Her passion for Jesus through her terse (but powerful) testimony sharing moment at the intro of \"Jesus Did It\" reveals Cobbs' Jesus besotted heart.  But if you are looking for those smooth R&B style worship ballads sung with a throttle full of emotions, then \"Fill Me Up\" is right up your alley.  In the same trajectory is the lead single \"Jesus Saves.\"  While many Gospel artists think they can get away with a poorly structured song with their live impromptu rantings, \"Jesus Saves\" takes no short cuts.  Rather, telling the story of Christ's redemption with perspicuity, \"Jesus Saves\" is a deftly crafted song.\n\nThis time around, Cobbs has invited a few guests to sing with her.  While Kierra Sheard joins Cobbs on the somehow predictable Gospel shut-out \"Put a Praise On It,\" Jamie Grace's duet here is something to write home about. \"The Solid Rock\" finds Cobbs breaking out of her comfort zone in tackling what is an acoustic-sounding piece with flashes of country, reggae, and folk all mixed into it.  Fans who are willing to invest in this album need to be aware that \"One Place Live\" comes in five different configurations: CD (11 tracks); Digital Album (11 tracks); Limited Tour Edition (Wal-Mart Exclusive \/ 15 tracks); Digital Deluxe (16 tracks) and Vinyl (8 tracks).\n\nIf you love her previous album \"Grace,\" you will love this new record even more.  Here Cobbs feels freer and more herself in delivering what is more than an hour's worth of worship without walls.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I picked up this CD almost on a whim last month. I buy a lot of CDs on Amazon, but I still love shopping in brick & mortar retail CD shops (ah, the old record stores!) when I get the chance. Unfortunately, nowadays, especially where I live in Bangkok, the shops are fewer in number and selection is dreadful, normally catering to a younger generation that doesn't even purchase CDs! Ah, don't get me started!\n\nI'm by no means a hardcore Bee Gees fan, and I'd never even heard a complete solo album by Robin Gibb, but I've always enjoyed the Bee Gees music over the years and when I saw this CD on the shelf I decided to give it a shot. Great decision; this album is stunningly good!\n\nAs you would expect from a songwriter and singer of Gibb's caliber, the songs sparkle and stick in your head. Plus, his voice sounds like it hasn't aged a bit; still vibrant and brilliant. Honestly, this is pure pop genius of the highest order. It's hard to believe that these song were just sitting around in his archives, albeit relatively recent recordings made shortly before he tragically passed away, and hadn't been released yet. Once again, another sad commentary on the state of the music industry when an artist this great can't get his new songs released, or that it took his death to make it a reality.\n\nEvery listener will have their favorite songs on this album, but the ones that captivate me the most are \"Days Of Wine And Roses\", \"Alan Freeman Days\", Anniversary\", \"Sorry\", \"Avalanche\",  and \"Sanctuary.\" And after hearing the story behind the album's closing track, the demo of \"Sydney,\" it's hard to not to fall in love with that song too.\n\nI think this one is a no-brainer for any fan of the Bee Gees or Robin Gibb's solo recordings, all of which I am now eager to go back and discover. Like the other reviewers have pretty much concurred; this one is a gem!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"This version of Ave Maria is very special to me because I own so many instrumental versions of Ave Maria, yet found this one unique. Now I will tell you why: When I hear this played, I close my eyes and really get into the music. What I feel like is that I am in a cafe with a very talented piano player playing Ave Maria and I am sitting right next to the piano.\nFor me, I listen to this song year round and it lifts my spirit, especially this outstanding version of the song.\n\nThe sound had such a LIVE QUALITY to it. Believe me, I have listened to over 50 versions of Ave Maria (instrumental) and this is one of the best if not the best I heard and it was free.\n\nHighly recommend this to all!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Temples have been given significant exposure being mentioned by some big names and also touring with The Rolling Stones. While the album is a pleasant listen, it offers little beyond standard 60's and 70's psychedelic pop rock. I don't think the songwriting is adventurous enough for me. While I really dig quite a few of the tracks here I can't shake the feeling that it all feels too straight forward and by the book. It takes the nostalgia factor a little too far and takes itself too seriously, missing out on the quirkiness and spontaneity of 60's psychedelic rock. Not a bad cut on this thing but if you're familiar at all with these genres and have heard the album once, it has little more to offer because of how predictable it is. 3\/5.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"First of all, you can barely make out most of what they are saying.  The production values are terrible.  I could have done a better job with a 1980's 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version.  Secondly, the message is stupid.  They don't really have anything worthwhile to say, and I regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind.  Everything about this band, about this album, was a waste of time.  This is why they needed to put a photo of a blond with suggestive body tape on the cover.  There's no way the music was going to sell this album!","classification":1,"fold":6}

{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about this CD.  The musical support provided by Lowell George, other membrs of Little Feat and the Meters are simply stunning.  The keyboard parts stand out very much and the drumming is very funky.  The best song by far is the title track.  What a cool groove.\n\nOutside is another strong track.  Whereas I like Sailing Shoes, it just does not compare to the Little Feat version.  It all starts with the vocals.  Robert Palmer just can not compare to Lowell George on this track.\n\nAS a matter of fact, Robert Palmers vocals are erratic on this CD.  He's very good on the title track, Outside and decent on a couple of others.  However, that last song, Throught It All With You, Mr. Palmer just sounds like he is grunting and does not rise above the solid backing unit.\n\nAlso many of the songs do not have solid hooks.  Robert Palmer would go on to record more solid hook driven songs later in his career.  On this CD, it is very hit and miss.\n\nBasically the style is good but the substance is not there full time yet.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"For the music of 1994, the scene changed immediately, from Grunge to Hip Hop. In the case for Boyz II Men, they became even more popular then the boys from Philadelphia. At that time, they became bigger than most of the manufactured music out there. Although they started big, the ballads they were making were explosive.\nThe 1994 album, II became the most successful R&B album of the decade, selling almost 14 million albums, and launching 4 smash hit songs including Water Runs Dry, I'll Make Love To You, On Bended Knee, and Thank You. At that time, they really proved that the music spoke for itself, not an image among all boundaries. The style blended beautifully with similar artists like The Temptations, The Four Tops, and even The Jackson 5. Nevertheless, they actually were at the very beginning of the Corporate Pop era that lead to Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys. Luckily, the music wasn't locked into Teen Idol stardom, which made Boyz II Men one of the most popular groups of the 90's.\nIt is kind of sad that a lot of teen acts that are out there aren't mature enough like Boyz II Men. It is just incredible to know that some acts constantly can't capture that era. Hopefully, the next true Soul group, can recapture the legacy Boyz II Men set.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"Lily Allen burst onto the pop scene in 2006 with her smashing debut CD, \"Alright, Still.\"  Her style was unlike anything else, and she scored a couple of top 10 hits in the UK, including the #1 \"Smile.\"  Her music was cheeky fun, and I wondered what her new music would sound like.  Frankly, her first CD was so original that I thought that any new music would sound derivative or conversely would sound too different.  Fortunately, she's found a nice balance on \"The Fear,\" her first single from her second CD.\n\n\"The Fear\" wisely is more electropop than her other songs, which is certainly popular nowadays (see Katy Perry, \"Circus\" by Britney, Lady Gaga, \"Disturbia\" by Rihanna).  The song pokes fun at pop stars and how they get famous, starting with the audacious opening lyrics: I want to be rich and I want lots of money\/ I don't care about clever I don't care about funny\/ I want loads of clothes and f***loads of diamonds\/ I heard people die while they are trying to find them.  I could definitely imagine the song being a massive UK hit.  Will it get played on US radio?  That's much harder to say, as her last CD received relatively little airplay here.  \"The Fear\" is probably more overtly commercial sounding than her prior work; however, it doesn't have a strong chorus that makes it sound like an obvious hit.  I hope I'm wrong, and I'll enjoy this single either way.  Can't wait for her forthcoming CD, \"It's Not Me, It's You.\"","classification":4,"fold":6}
{"text":"Trina released a very enjoyable album for April Fool's Day 2008!  I thought her debut was decent, but not at all groundbreaking, so I thought this album would be along the lines of her debut, but oh no!  It's a lot better.  \"Still Da Baddest\" is definitely a solid album.  Trina is still talking about sex, how pretty she is (and she is pretty), how great her sex is, and she reminds us that she's still \"da baddest b****.\"  Ironically, though, when I read her interviews, she does not come off as b****y at all.  She seems to be a very kind, gentle and mature woman.  I know there is another side, but it's nice to know that she is a sweetheart beneath the sassiness.\n\n Up-beat tunes and good lyrics fill this album.  Trina's delivery is as energetic and confident as ever, and trust me, you will be dancing and\/or snapping at some point when listening to this album.  Sure, this album is on the experimental side and Trina's voice serves as an annoyance because it is unusually high-pitched  sometimes, but, as a unit, rap fans should be entertained by this LP.  \"Single Again\" was the album's first release.  The catchy hook will really help you get into this song, particularly its melody. Also, this is one of Trina's best songs lyrically.  She apparently sat down and thought this song out before penning it.  Nice beat, too.  Trina is a product of Miami and it was a nice touch for her to speak with a southern drawl on \"Killing You H***.\"  In this song, Trina informs her listener that she is hot and these other women aren't on her level nor are they doing anything for her.  Again, the beat is nice and the hook is alright as well.  Pitbull lends his talents on \"Stop Traffic.\"  His voice is so easy to listen to and he adds flavor to the song.  Every song on this album is at least decent, therefore, you can press play and listen to it from track one to track twelve.\n\n Trina is definitely improving as a rapper.  This is a really nice LP and is recommended by me.  Continue progressing, Trina.  You have a supporter in me.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"Still da Baddest\"\n2. \"I Got a Bottle\"\n3. \"Hot Commodity\"\n4. \"Look Back at Me\"\n5. \"Single Again\"","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"I was reading reviews for this album and I was shocked at what people were saying about this. The ratings given for this are also very unfair. This band keeps getting beaten down by it's fans and listeners of rock music in general for no good reason other than they started \"nu-metal\" and were trendy at one point. People who say that the band sold out or are stale are very wrong. \"Remember Who You Are\" is a really great album and I've been a fan since the beginning.\n\n2 original members of the band, Head on guitar and David Silviera on drums, left the group and so the remaining members took a while to re-group and fill their slots with new bandmates. They sound great in the mix of everything. The sound of this new album may reflect the earlier sound of Korn from the 90's some, but don't think that the band isn't still moving in a more progressive style while they're unleashing heaviness. In Jonathan Davis' lyrics, the themes of past Korn albums are there still but frustration about people trying to influence him creatively and feeling guilty\/upset about his former bandmates leaving shines through pretty strongly (that's my interpretation anyway). Here's a quick track by track:\n\n1. Uber-time- 2\/5 Just a short lead-in to Oildale\n2. Oildale (Leave Me Alone)- 5\/5\n3. Pop a Pill- 5\/5\n4. Fear Is a Place to Live- 4\/5\n5. Move On- 4\/5\n6. Lead the Parade- 3.5\/5\n7. Let the Guilt Go- 5\/5\n8. The Past- 5\/5\n9. Never Around- 5\/5\n10. Are You Ready to Live?- 5\/5\n11. Holding All These Lies- 5\/5\n\nThis isn't a perfect album but I'm glad that the band isn't releasing copy-cats of their old albums; just because they play harder music doesn't mean they're selling out. \"The Path to Totality\" shows what they're willing to put on the line to create what they want.\n\nIf you're a die-hard Korn fan who's stuck on their old sound, you might hate this with a passion or you could put aside your bias and find that there's a lot to like here.\n\nIf you're new to Korn, don't start here; their debut or \"Issues\" would be a good place in my opinion.","classification":4,"fold":6}

Raymond v. Raymond was not my favorite album of 2010 by any means, despite being an avid fan of Usher, however as I've stated already, it did help to re-establish his fan base after many faded between the four-year hiatuses between 'Confessions' and 'Here I Stand.'  However, 'Raymond v. Raymond' underwrites Usher's vocal talent with clubby and sometimes sub-par material.  In other words, lyrical substance and overall substance of that album seem empty.  The accompanying EP&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Versus\/dp\/B003V6L932\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Versus<\/a>&nbsp;just might be worse.  A nine-song set tacked on as a separate EP or as the second disc of the reissue of Raymond v. Raymond, it is no 'Confessions Special Edition'.  From the packaging, one instantly sees that this was a rush deal and that while some of this new songs are enjoyable enough, they ultimately possess even less substance than Raymond itself.\n\n\"Love `Em All\" opens the album smartly with solid production work ala contemporary R&B and a strong vocal performance by Usher.  It is by no means `the second coming,' but it works and it does establish Usher better than the odd \"Monstar\" did on Raymond vs. Raymond.  It fails as being a strong opener like \"Love in This Club\" (Here I Stand) or \"Yeah!\" (Confessions), but you take what you can get with this EP.  \"DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love,\" featuring Pitbull just doesn't really appeal to me.  I don't feel that Usher's voice is best reflected with a euro-pop styled production as the canvas underlying it.  Usher pulls it off - I hardly think anyone would deny him that - but it just seems like \"sell-out\" given his prodigious vocal abilities and natural talent.  It's average or just the slightest bit in my mind, but that's not saying much for the man who has given the R&B\/pop worlds numerous memorable songs and performances.\n\n\"Hot Tottie,\" featuring Jay-Z is ok.  It's not horrible but it's not great.  If anything, it is a bit odd; the production work is interesting, the hook is incredibly wordy, and Jay-Z's guest spot is ok, if less than stellar.  I like it well enough, but then again, I don't love it and I feel that the sheen will quickly wear off, as much of generic R&B and pop does these days.  \"Lay You Down\" adds some `ummph' to the album returning Usher to his 1990s glory days with a traditional, contemporary R&B production supporting him.  Solid, \"Lay You Down\" will be the cut everyone will pass over on this EP that is probably better than all the rest.\n\n\"Lingerie\" is a bit of a throwaway completely in my mind that is NOT catchy in my eyes.  Usher sounds good, if uninspired as the combination of his brilliant falsetto and the wordiness of the hook make the lyrics almost impossible to decipher.  I don't connect to this song, but when the track is entitled \"Lingerie,\" it gives a connotation of \"sleaze,\" which is unfortunate.  \"There Goes My Baby\" is filler material considering it appears on 'Raymond v. Raymond,' though it is also a smart addition given the fact it is probably the best cut, hands down.  My favorite club cut that is the most genuine to me is \"Get in My Car,\" featuring Bun B.  The production work is strong without compromising Usher's style as much as \"DJ Got Us Fallin in Love\" and it is enjoyable without growing annoying.\n\n\"Somebody to Love [Remix],\" featuring Justin Bieber is a bit weird.  Maybe it is because I'm used to `the Biebz' singing the majority of it and it just doesn't completely fit Usher (maybe there's a reason!) I give it a B... I supposed.  Closer \"Strangers Come\" comes over as a `stranger' as the track isn't that memorable.\n\nThe problem is that Usher seems to be conforming too much, as many R&B artists are today.  The problem with this EP is that there is no cohesiveness.  It is all over the place with no connection, much like some of Raymond v. Raymond only the effect is times ten. I'm sure \"DJ Got Us Fallin in Love\" will aid in sales, but I'd like to hear the Usher I came to know and love with hits like \"U Don't Have To Call\" or \"Burn.\"  2 1\/2 stars\/C-...","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"How great it is to hear from Kate Pierson again! Like the work she created as a member of the B-52's, she has made an upbeat solo album on which she applies her big voice to mostly off-the-wall themes. Musically, the sound is about what you would expect, and it is both appropriate and welcome. It is an energetic blend of shiny 80's pop & new wave, and light classic rock, with a dash of techno. Kate's vocals stand out against some familiar B-52's harmonies and melodramatic backup singing.\n\nAs for the lyrics, the free association found in these songs would make Beck sit up and take notice. The songs were co-written mainly by Kate in association with an artist currently in vogue, Sia, who serves as Executive Producer. Despite the ambiguity, there is truth and reality to be found in these contrived curiosities. In \"Throw Down The Roses\", Kate is stating that she doesn't need a relationship with a celebrity to validate herself: \"I can't ever be your girl VIP...I don't ever do rocker boys like you\/I'm an artist too\". \"Mister Sister\" is about a tortured transgender boy who at last achieves recognition as a desirable girl: \"Finally finally finally\/You hear the words\/you make a beautiful girl\/and nothing hurts when you are a beautiful girl\". \"Crush Me With Your Love\" uses semi-scientific terms to describe the desire for strong physical love: \"Lab rat soaring\/Palm to solar plexus...You're the north I'm the south of the magnet I have longed for\". Now this could be my imagination, but I find a sequence that forms a scenario for me in the last 3 tracks. In \"Matrix\" there is the delight of anarchy in time and space: \"You're free falling without a landing\/The matrix swallows you in...Feel the absence of time and loss\/There's a place for you in sunset limbo on a beach in space\". Then, in \"Time Wave Zero\", we find the possible cause of this anarchy, namely the end of the world caused by disastrous space events: \"Solar storms\/The end of our days\/Ambush asteroid heading our way...End of time\/Black hole betray\/Apocalypse fractures the Milky Way\". The end result? The final track \"Pulls You Under\" sounds like it is talking about death, or at least moving on to a different state of existence: \"Pulls you under and you beg for peace to come...Say goodbye to your torment\/The rivers you cried\/The prison is your skin but you shed it tonight\". This last track is one of 2 slower songs on the album; the other one is \"Wolves\". \"Pulls You Under\" is the one most like a conventional ballad, with good prominent piano accompaniment. And at the end of \"Wolves\", you get to hear some actual wolves!\n\nWhatever the intent in meaning was for Kate and her producers, the album combines good fun and good music, like the B-52's recordings always did. I had no idea Kate had made a solo album, and I thank Amazon for prompting it to me as an item of interest.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"One of Viennas first music publishers, Franz Hoffmeister (1754-1812) was close friends with most of the composers of the high Classical Era.  In a letter, Beethoven referred to him as my most beloved brother, and Mozart dedicated his String Quartet in D Major, KV 499 to him.  He also wrote a little music, with at least 8 operas, as many as 66 symphonies, about 57 string quartets and numerous other chamber works to his credit.  Much of that chamber music includes a flute, as does at least 25 concertos.\n\nPublished in 1795, his first D Major Concerto on the present recording is No. 24 on that list.  With an orchestral introduction that is nearly 3 minutes in length, the martial Allegro that begins the composition is an ambitiously expansive movement.  Driven by horns and booming tympani, it effectively sets up the feathery entrance of the solo flute.  Instead of creating an interactive relationship, Hoffmeister uses the symphonic backing to fill in behind the single wind instrument, deftly weaving the orchestral passages around the melodic lines, following the breath patterns and not overwhelming the delicate sound of the flute.  And it is a virtuosic display.  Demanding a high level of technique, this first movement is challenge that the flutist, Bruno Meier easily rises to meet.\n\nEmploying a gentle Alla plocca ma lento as the leisurely middle section allows the flute ample opportunity to stretch out and embellish the charming, aria-like tune.  As the horns waft overhead, the music shifts into G Minor, adding drama by the use of chromatic modulations and striking harmonies before easing back to the major key for the placid ending.  A bubbly flute introduces the festive theme for the closing Rondo Moderato.  Rapid runs and extreme changes of register mark the bravura solo work while tempo shifts, brief episodes in minor, playful syncopated flourishes and a surprising time signature change into triple meter enliven the boisterous finale.\n\nAnother spacious Allegro opens the 21st concerto, published in 1788 and also penned in D Major.  Buttressed by the horns, the orchestral intro for the first movement is nearly as extensive as the other opening allegro.  Elegant and immediately engaging, the solo wind carries the tuneful excursions through wide ranging development again without much interaction with the symphonic support.\n\nIn the dark key in D Minor, the dramatic Romanza Adagio bristles with ominous undertones as the flute fashions a remarkable contrast with the accompaniment for strings only.  Despite an interlude in the relatively brighter F Major, the heavy aura of the 2nd movement never lifts.  But the brash finale, a triple metered Rondo Allegro completely dissipates the gloom.  Brilliant virtuosity in the flute lines characterize this sparkling close to the concerto.\n\nThe 2011 recording by Naxos is terrific, well balanced with depth and excellent detail.  Bruno Meiers work on solo flute is exemplary, and the Prague Chamber Orchestra provides sturdy and sensitive support.  Although these 2 fine compositions were issued during Hoffmeisters lifetime, this disc marks their world premiere.  One of the most popular composers during the Viennese Classical period, he fell into obscurity upon his death.  While his work will never rival Beethovens, it does present a glimpse into this excellent craftsmen who became an also ran in the shadow of the master from Bonn.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Mid-1970s black music seemed dominated either by fun, mindless party jams like \"Jungle Boogie\" and \"Skin Tight,\" or dour warnings like \"Future Shock\" and \"Living For The City.\" Stevie Wonder sang his share of life-affirming music but Earth, Wind & Fire, here with a definitive one-disc greatest hits, made such positive strength the heart of their musical identity.\nSome of the era's most needed, heeded messages ran deep and sweet atop Verdine White's bass grooves (front and center on \"Getaway\"), brother and leader Maurice's drum and percussion tracks  honed over years with Chess Records' rhythm section (\"Saturday Nite,\" \"Kalimba Story,\" 1977's dazzling \"Serpentine Fire\"), Louis Satterfield's horn section scrambling through jazz-rock mazes every track (becoming a 80s rock stalwart backing Phil Collins), and Phillip Bailey's high, clear falsetto on \"After The Love Has Gone,\" the prom dance standard \"Reasons,\" the soaring chorus of \"September,\" and the elegant \"Fantasy\" which, with \"Serpentine Fire,\" gave R&B one of its best 1-2 LP opening tracks. (It's restored to album length here, with Larry Dunn's superb keyboard intros, after being edited on two previous best-ofs).\nMessages like \"You're a shining star...shining bright to see what you can truly be,\"  \"If you sing a song today, you will make a better way,\" \"Try to resist all the hurt that's all around ya...\" moved feet and hearts, misinterpreted by spiritual seekers and hedonists alike in the \"Me\" decade's last discofied days. The Whites understood disco's falsity: \"Morning deals a bad hand to a woman who has made too many bets,\" Maurice sings on 1979's galloping disco smash \"Boogie Wonderland,\" adding, \"You dance and shake the hurt.\" But by early 1982, needing a hit after a slow-selling double-LP the year before, EWF gave in to the dance grooves and party-down lyrics of \"Let's Groove,\" their last Top 5 hit.\nDespite a generous 18 tracks (and an excellent geneology of the group by Kevin Goins), longtime fans will miss \"In The Stone,\" \"Fall In Love With Me,\" \"Head To The Sky,\" \"Let Me Talk,\" and others. These are found on 1995's \"Eternal Dance\" box, the \"Elements of Love\" ballads collection, or two previous best-ofs. This \"Greatest Hits\" packs their best-known pop songs into an exceptionally sounding disc (thanks to Mark Wilder's remastering), providing an essential introduction to one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's most surprising, satisfying member groups.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Lennon's songs ( You're Gonna Lose That  Girl,You've Got to Hide YOur Love Away) all shimmer showing a poetic side  to Lennon only hinted at on previous releases. Rubber Soul would find  Lennon's songwriting in full flower.\nHelp and Ticket to Ride (the former  co-written with McCartney while the latter was arranged by Paul)are two of  Lennon's strongest songs. McCartney's songs on the first part are merely  filler, but well written filler. Paul's best songs are saved for what used  to be side two. Yesterday and the folky I've Just Seen a Face are filled to  the brim with shimmering melodies and chord changes.\nGeorge's two  contributions, while melodically interesting, showed that he had a long way  to go to catch up to both Lennon & McCartney.\nThe outstanding  moments on this CD outweigh the weaker ones. Help! Really deserves 4 1\/2  stars as the album has much more filler than the two albums that followed.  Still, there is considerable growth and creativity invested in this  \"soundtrack\". It's still an essential Beatles album even though  it is a transitional work.\nGeorge Martin's production and remix is  stunning. There is a clarity here that was missing from the rough mixes  released in 1965. Still, there are many fans who prefer the original mixes  to the new ones although they don't differ substanially to these ears.\nMy only complaint is the lack of bonus tracks.

{"text":"If Metallica's 1983 \"Kill 'Em All\" wrote the book on thrash metal, then their sophomore release \"Ride The Lightning\" re-wrote the book on what metal was capable of. It was simply revolutionary at the time. Since \"Kill 'Em All\", the members of Metallica had seriously expanded their talents, technique and their approach with this groundbreaker. Every track offers something new, and experimental. The instruments aren't the only improvement. Hetfield's lyrics are much more personal, and conscious. The extended instrument arrangements blow everything from \"Kill 'Em All\" out of the water. Tracks such as \"Fade To Black\" and \"The Call of Ktulu\" were absolutely phenomenal works, untouched by the standards of 1984. And although it's up for debate, Hammett's guitar solos are my favorite on this album. Check out the two and a half minute guitar solo on \"Ride The Lightning\", that left my body covered with goose bumps as a teen, and still does to this day. Other highlights include \"Fight Fire with Fire,\" and \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\". This album rocks in epic proportions.\n\nOverall, Metallica ruled the world at this point in time. There was no limits to their re-invention of raw, hardcore thrash metal. I was a huge Metallica fan growing up, and this one got spun the most. This is a absolute must have for anyone that claims they are a Metallica fan.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"The contemporary metal scene is an over-saturated genre. While this may seem overly simplified, there are an endless number of bands with little to no distinguishing characteristics - their generic metal replete with growling\/screaming vocalists, endless triggered double bass drum beats and less than thought provoking and often indiscernible lyrics. Mastodon, on the other hand, is the antithesis to that formulaic approach to metal craftsmanship. Their brand of progressive extreme metal is truly progressive in that it is constantly in evolution and it seems they push the boundaries of what's come before with each release. Driven by the lurching riffs of Brent Hinds and the frenetic drumming of Brann Dailor they continue to mesmerize in a fashion similar to late `90's Tool. And while I don't pretend to fully understand their lyrics, I appreciate everything they've done for the contemporary metal scene, both with their studio releases and their constant touring. They are truly a workhorse metal band in an era of over processed and \"get on the radar quick\" under creative music. Dailor's unorthodox approach to drumming really shines through - his propensity for fast snare runs and handwork stands out in stark opposition to the current trend for metal drummers to forsake the hands in favor of a fast, yet monotonous foot rhythm. The more melodic style of singing remains a staple of the current Mastodon stable - catchy and memorable choruses abound.  Heavier than the previous release, Once More Round The Sun is perhaps best described as combination of those qualities that made the progressive Crack The Skye so compelling and the more commercial The Hunter more accessible. In doing so, they will likely continue to expand their fan base without sacrificing their commitment to being innovative, yet heavy.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"In 1968 \"Super Session\" helped take rock & roll to a whole new level. It pushed the envelope passed the 2 and 3 minute danceable pop songs, creating a longer more progressive rock pallet, paying more attention to technical and subtle aspects of the music. The three musicians that created the super group, Al Kooper (piano\/organ\/ondioline\/vocals\/guitars - Blood Sweat & Tears), Mike Bloomfield (guitar - Bob Dylan's \"Highway 61 Revisited\", Electric Flag), and Stephen Stills (guitar - Crosby, Stills Nash [& Young], Buffalo Springfield), were all \"on hiatus\" from their most recent engagements. The three of them never actually played \"together\", instead it was split into sets of Kooper\/Bloomfield and the other by Kooper\/Stills. The band was backed by a powerful rhythm section as well, Harvey Brooks (bass - Miles Davis, Bob Dylan's \"Highway 61 Revisited\") and Eddie Hoh (drums - The Monkees) as well as Barry Goldberg (electric piano - Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels, Electric Flag).\n\nThe heavy Electric Chicago blues works beautifully on the Kooper\/Bloomfield originals, \"Albert's Shuffle\", \"Stop\", and \"Man's Temptation\". The arrangements are precise, fluid and melodic. Kooper's organ solos provide a groovy melodic edge to the music. \"Man's Temptation\" is a very soulful number, reminiscent of Blood, Sweat & Tears. The 9 minute trippy waltz of \"His Holy Modal Majesty\" features the longest jam on the Kooper\/Bloomfield side. The track also features Koopers electric keyboard-manipulated ondioline, sounding kind of like a tenor sax, although very unique.\n\nDue to health issues, Bloomfield was unable to finish the recording of \"Super Session\". This is where Steven Stills came in. He's first heard on a rendition of Bob Dylan's \"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\". Still's biggest highlight on the album and a personal favorite of mine is \"Season of the Witch\". This 11 minute epic song displays the boiling chemistry Kooper and Stills have working together, offering inspired interaction between the two. \"You Don't Love Me\" allows Stills to play some heavy amplified distorted lead guitar, sounding a bit like Jimi Hendrix.\n\nThis is one of those albums that age very well. Upon my first listen roughly a year ago, I was blown away at how fresh it sounded after all these years. It is unlike anything I've ever heard, offering influence in a big way to the Electric Chicago blues and rock and roll movement. I am very pleased to say that the remastered version of this album, done by Al Kooper himself, sounds awesome, loud and clear. That's something that fans of the original vinyl release will be anxious to snatch up.","classification":5,"fold":6}

And at the end of every season the show plays a recap of the season's events right before the season finale... and said recap is invariably accompanied by this stirring number.\n\nI haven't listened to anything else by Kansas, but if \"Carry On Wayward Son\" is any indication, they were a pretty epic band.  \"Carry On Wayward Son\" balances out the more energetic portions of the song with some slightly slower, more low-key bridges that have an almost thoughtful sound to them, and are mostly piano instead of the guitar-and-drums of the rest.  Not all songs can hit this balance successfully, so props to the songwriters for this.  And while no \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" it is a lot more musically complex than most songs of today.  Whatever happened to these songwriters anyhow...\n\nA classic rock number that's enjoying some newfound popularity thanks to \"Supernatural,\" this is a great song for both classic rock fans and \"Supernatural\" fans to enjoy... or heck, any fans of quality music.

There will never be an Artist that can change character and revamp the music industry like Robert Kelly has done. He has really defined the true essence of diversity. I have all of Kelly's albums including one that was lost in a huge boot leg scandal. Before chocolate factory there was an album called \"Love Land\". This \"Love Land\" album reminds me of that album.  Smooth sounds from the 50's and 60's that was mixed with other smooth grooves similar to the 12 play album. Kelly put an album together that was un- orthodox for music executives. His ingenious mind to take chances in music is what gives him not only the title of \"King of R&B\" but the ability to adopt better then any other artist in the game today. This album is perfect!

Now if only this song were worthy of her vocal talents. While it's pretty good for a pop song, the lyrics had me scratching my head. \"The black is turning into blue...\" Did she just get a bruise? I know this line actually means she's enjoying a brighter outlook on life, but this sentiment could've been expressed a little more gracefully. Nevertheless, this wasn't too bad for a free song.

{"text":"Time Has Come Today was one of the first few songs I learned to play on my Silvertone electric guitar. It became a staple of my high school garage band that played around Virginia Beach in the late 60's and early 70's. So it should be no surprise that the driving beat of this notable call to action from the Chambers Brothers holds a special place for me.\n\nUnlike many of the songs and artists from those times I think this tune and their greater works have stood the test of time very well with those other artists we still hear broadcast. The message is still as applicable now as it was then. Time HAS come today.","classification":5,"fold":6}
{"text":"After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.\n\nI can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title \"The Essential Jim Reeves.\" To please everyone would be nigh on impossible considering the fact he had 80 Country hit singles between 1953 and 1984, 27 of which crossed over to the Hot 100, six to the Adult Contemporary charts (which didn't begin until 1961), and one to the R&B charts. Never mind the hundreds of equally-wonderful selections from his many EPs and LPs.\n\nAll in all, however, I'd say he did a fairly credible job, augmented by five pages of liner notes by Colin Escott and three more photos of Jim, including one with wife Mary at an Awards ceremony. A partial discography of the contents is also included, but without any chart details.\n\nAll but track 20 [recorded in 1958 and included on an early LP] were hits for Jim, 18 of them pop crossovers [only track 4 made only the Country list, going to # 2 early in 1959]. His version of the old standard, I Love You Because, was recorded in 1962 and was first released on the RCA Victor LP Gentleman Jim and, in 1976, became a # 54 Country hit as a single.\n\nNote, too, that the version of Am I Losing You was the one cut in 1960 and released on RCA Victor 7800, going to # 8 Country\/# 31 Hot 100 as the flipside of I Missed Me [# 3 Country\/# 44 Hot 100 and not included here], The first version, done in 1957 [# 3 Country], remains a bit difficult to find.\n\nThe earliest hit represented here, and the one that leads off the disc, is Four Walls [# 1 Country for EIGHT weeks in 1957] which was his initial pop crossover [# 11]. However, this came after 13 Country hits beginning in 1953 with Mexican Joe [# 1 for NINE weeks credited to Jim Reeves And The Circle O Ranch Boys].\n\nSo I tend to agree with another reviewer who says that at least one of those should have been included in an \"essential\" CD. Not counting the first six, five of which were for the Abbott label and one, I Love You, a # 3 duet with Ginny Wright on the Fabor label, there were seven RCA cuts to choose from. The best of these included the afore-mentioned Am I Losing You, as well as Yonder Comes A Sucker and According To My Heart, both # 4s.\n\nStill, it's hard to be critical of this fine effort which richly deserves every one of the maximum 5 stars.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Ghostface Killah & Adrian Younge continue their collaboration series with \"Twelve Reasons to Die II\" except this time the story takes palce in New York City (Raekwon plays his enemy & features on most of the tracks). Lyrically, Ghostface does his thing & so does Rae but it feels like something is missing. Rae is the only one from the Wu to feature & the only other worth mentioning is Vince Staples on \"Get the Money\". The production isn't as fitting as the first either & the run time is too short to tell the story that they are trying to convey. I don't think that Adrian Younge's realm is Hip-Hop which is obviously necessary. But at the end it's still not a bad album by any means. It just needed a certain amount of detailed attention in some areas. Hopefully next time around (pretty sure that there is going to be a third installation from story clues) they will be sure to tend to certain problematic issues that slightly hindered this project.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"\"Dig In Deep\" is, in my opinion, the best and most complete album Bonnie Raitt has released in a long time. While her most popular albums which made her a household name, as good as they were, I felt they were not the Bonnie Raitt I had fallen in love with in 1972 with the release of \"Give It Up\".\n\"Dig In Deep\" reveals a very mature artist who, at age 66, knows herself, knows what she wants and DOES what she wants. This album utterly exudes confidence in herself and her band. This is likely, as with \"Give It Up\", an instant classic, noting how oxymoronic that phrase may be. Let's just say this is a GREAT album from a GREAT artist.\nIn an interview many years ago, Bonnie told the interviewer that the moment she heard John Lee Hooker \"gruntin' and groanin'\" she knew she had to play the blues and she had to  record with him. She made both of those things come true. Why mention that? Listen to one of the brightest gems in this jewel case, \"Need You Tonight\", a brilliant reworking\/cover of INXS' hit from their heyday. During that song, after drawling out a line, she utters a simple, \"Hmmm\", with all the female heart and soul and lust as any of John Lee's masculine grunts or groans. This track also features some of the best slide work on the album, and that is saying a lot.\nThat brings up one of the aspects of this album that grabbed my attention: the prominence of Bonnie's slide guitar playing. It's more out front than it has been on an entire album in a long time, and she plays with the certainty of an artist who doesn't take her talent for granted, rather it is played by someone who knows how hard she worked to attain that status as one of the best slide players around.\nI contend that this album, with most songs written and produced by Bonnie herself and with a few songs written by others, could only have been done by Bonnie Raitt. Everything that is excellent about Bonnie Raitt is here on display, including her unique signature style of singing\/playing any song she tackles. She makes them her own, whether she wrote them or not.\nTake her own song, \"The Comin' Round is Going Through\". This is Bonnie at her brutal best, featuring my favorite line on the album, \"Your money's no good here, we wouldn't cash your check if we could.\"\nAs brutally direct as she can be, there are few artists recording today who can deliver a ballad, or slow blues the way Bonnie does, as is demonstrated on the tracks, \"You've Changed My Mind,\" (written by Joseph Lee Henry) and \"I Knew,\" (written by Pat McLaughlin) respectively.\nFor good rockin' fun, there is \"Shakin' Shakin' Shakes,\" (written by Cesar Rosas and T Bone Burnett) which again features blistering slide by Bonnie and some great guitar work by George Marinelli.\nBonnie's own songs are all stand outs: \"Unintended Consequence of Love\", \"What You're Doing To Me,\" \"If You Need Somebody,\" and \"The Ones We Couldn't Be.\"\nThis album deserves more than five stars, in my opinion. You can check it out on Prime if  you are able, but I imagine most will want there own copy. Highest possible Recommendation.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"FOR ALT-J NEWBIES:\nIt's hard to categorize Alt-J's sound, which I think is often the trademark of really good bands. There's a sort of folk sensibility, but it's a lot more intricate and synthesized than you usually find in folk music. I've heard some refer to them as \"art rock,\" but I'm not sure what that is other than rock that's trying to be, y'know, artistic. The band also has a sort of trip-hop, art-house-pop feel to some of the songs, but it never feels cheap or chewy. The lead singer's voice has a delicately strained quality to it, like someone combined a yell of pleasure with a yell of pain and then slowed the resulting sound down to a gentle purr.\n\nTheir first album was pretty highly rated by people more in the know than myself, and by people in general, so if you're new to Alt-J, you should probably start there. This album is just as infectious and slippery as the first, though, and it plays just as much with the mind and heart while refusing to sit still long enough to be pigeonholed. Considering that cookie-cutter pop\/rock is pretty much everywhere these days, it's a treat to find something so indecipherably beautiful out there to be enjoyed.\n\nFOR FANS OF THE FIRST ALBUM:\nWhen I first played through this album, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the first one. I wasn't sure why. The songs here seemed darker, slower, and more fragile than those in AN AWESOME WAVE. Also, it seems like there's a real attempt to make a sort of story out of the way the songs are arranged, and it's not necessarily a story with a happy ending. There was darkness in the first album, but it seemed married to a graceful energy that made it aggressively intriguing.\n\nAfter listening to this album all the way through, I thought I'd put on the first album and listen to it again to see if I could more clearly figure out what differentiated them. And what I heard? No difference at all.\n\nThere's a definite shift in the artistic sensibility of the songs. This album does feel a bit more ... mature in its tone and themes. The songs are a little less bombastic and playful, trading that stuff in for more of a deep-water simmer. But as far as the actual quality of the writing, singing, and music, well, it's just as good as the first album. I was a little surprised, going back and forth between the two records, to realize that Alt-J had accomplished something so very rare for bands: they had created a sophomore album that showed growth and change in the band's direction without losing the skill and talent that made their first album such a hit. It's not the same, but it's not all that different, and it's still great stuff. If fans of the first album find this album a bit disappointing, I'm willing to wager that it's not necessarily because this record isn't good. Rather, it's probably because not only was the first record so good, but it also came with that soul-sparking thrill that you get when you discover something new and wonderful.\n\nThis record is just as wonderful, and the band has very beautifully woven newness into it as well, but there's still a comforting familiarity to the songs. It's pretty much exactly what you're looking for in a sophomore album.","classification":5,"fold":6}

With a set of deviating deaths in R&B legends we've lost this year with Natalie Cole, Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire, but honestly no death is more shocking and sad than the passing of Prince. The guy not only was brilliant, but his sound and song with R&B, funk, jazz and Rock is and will always transcend beyond boundaries in the way that David Bowie kept rolling with the tides years earlier. The guy really had so many memorable, that he had kept changing with time and everyone followed so deeply with the punches, and not bashing him at heart. When Doves Cry is one of his deepest songs from Purple Rain. The song still ignites aflame that can definitely showcase his sensuality in song, with a deep soul from his heart that really showed his sensitivity in song.

Nonetheless, I was unable to resist purchasing the MP3 version so that I can listen to it on my Kindle and Ipod.  The tune is quite mesmerizing and, I think, soothing,  Strange, I know, considering it's sung in high pitched voice.  LOL  I recently introduced my five and seven year olds to it and they both love it.  My daughter--7--says it reminds her of Arabian dancers.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Bob Baldwin is one of the hardest working jazz musicians in the business. In addition to his musical creations, he's also has a hand in organizing a music festival in Westchester County (NY). He's also had some bad luck in regards to record labels. The last CD he released with his previous label, A440 Music Group was a critical success. However, the company suffered from a  cash flow problem to promote his and other artists CD's and declared bankruptcy last year. Baldwin has since signed on with 215 Records out of Philadelphia for his latest release, \"All in a Day's Work\".  For those who are not familiar with Baldwin, just think of Alex Bugnon with soul.  His style is smooth, very hip.  His music sounds very much like New York.  it has an urban style that is sophisticated and classy.  I thought that sound was clear with the title track as well as the song, \"Steamy\".  They were clearly the best tracks on the CD.  I was very thrilled by his release.  He'll be in our play list for sometime.  It's an outstanding piece of work.","classification":5,"fold":6}

There problem is they release songs that aren't meant for radio air play, when they should be picking radio air play songs like Drag Me Down.  Infinity was released for the follow up single, and honestly? it should have remained on the album. They should have followed up with another up beat song. I don't know whose advising them, but that individual should be fired, because they have some really great songs. Midnight Memories was a great under rated album (at least in the US) and Four was a more mature sound with great songs. Four received some surprisingly great reviews from grown men ( who hate Boy Bands or rather pop bands) and they loved the throw back Modern Rock sound of the album. Problem for the band was, once again, releasing songs that were meant for stadium concerts and not the radio.

The sound is raw and at times distorted but these elements are a huge help in making this one of the best live recordings of The Jimi Hendrix Experience from Jimi's golden year of 1968. Few concerts from 1968 were recorded professionally so this is a rarity and a special show to have.\nMy favourite song off the album is 'I Don't Live Today'. The drum intro is very special and when Jimi's guitar comes in the song comes alive and continues for several minutes of relentless guitar and drums\/bass in the trio format.\nThis is Jimi Hendrix at the peak of his time with his original group before he changed in 1969 and discovered other music styles which continued to produced great music and amazing guitar work.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"At 99 cents, what's not to like?! Actually this is a great, eclectic collection of piano rags, most by Scott Joplin and played by the ragtime expert and composer William Bolcom, who plays them in a similar way as Joshua Rifkin: slow and easy, the way Joplin wanted. No honkytonk saloon music here! Also, there are rags by Joseph Lamb and some others including female composers and pianists. As a bonus, several piano works of the American composer and salon pianist (America's Chopin!) Louis Moreau Gottschalk. These are not rags but apparently Gottschalk was a major influence on the ragtime music movement, especially Joplin. They are wonderful pre-ragtime selections from the latter half of the 19th century, and were popular in the salons of the upper crust. Salon piano music was sort of the pop instrumental music of its time, but Gottschalk was a serious composer as well. These pieces show it. They are melodic--like good ragtime--and easy on the ears. Many of his songs (like The Dying Poet) were used as background for silent movies and became so common as to be cliche, thus the loss of popularity for Gottschalk's music (and other salon music) until revivals began in the late 20th century. Eugene List, a classical pianist, performs the Gottschalk.\nIf you like ragtime, or pop piano music in general, this is a no-brainer--especially at 99 cents for 111 songs!","classification":5,"fold":6}

So for all fans this is a very welcome occasion to hear an official, brilliantly recorded concert.\n\nAnd thankfuly they deliver a profound evening, mixing the old classics with newer songs, including Graham Nash's controversial and poignant tribute to Bradley Manning \"Almost Gone\". And diving deep into their impressive back catalogue, specially Stephen Stills who come up with the rarely performed \"As I Come Of Age\" and \"So Begins The Task\" (both played at the CSNY 1970 tour). Especially the first is truly magic, providing one of the moments of transcendent (vocal) beauty that is unique for this trio.\n\nMuch malign has been said about Stills's vocal, but actually his singing is better here than it has been in many years really enabling him to hit the higher notes. And his legendary guitarplaying as firery and riveting as ever. Graham Nash - probably one of the all time most underrated songwriters - and David Crosby still delivers their trademark harmony vocals.\n\nAs some of the other reviews here sadly demonstrates this band has for whatever reasons always attracted a certain animosity and some decisevely unfair criticism (I have good ears and I don't hear any false or rough vocals on this recording at all).\n\nSure the day when they were the vanguard is long gone, but what they deliver 2012 is very far from nostalgia and cash-in.

{"text":"Back in 1998, Brandy was sittin' on top of the world, with multi-platinum albums, starring roles in movies, and her own sitcom. Much has changed over the course of that time, but Brandy has remained relatively active on the music scene, but she was unable to match the success of that 1998 album \"Never Say Never.\" Part of tha has been due to the long gap between her albums, and true to form, it has been several long years since her previous album dropped. So here we are all of a sudden, a full decade later, and Brandy sounding more accomplished and seasoned than ever; her music never had embraced the foolishness of the boy and girl band era, nor did her style fit that of those who thought it wise to record ballad after ballad featuring some gangsta rapper doing background vocals. Rather, Brandy has perservered, actually coming up with a set of hooks that not only equal but exceed those of \"Never Say Never.\"\n\nThe smooth balladry of \"True\" and the title track \"Human\" give only a glimpse of what she can do; the fantastic lead-off single \"Right Here (Departed)\" and the closing track \"Fall\" are the highlights of the set, showcasing a wide display of melodic range, with dead-on vocals, including the harmony. Perhaps she has even made Darkchild a better songwriter by delivering such empassioned performances - he has not come up with a set of hooks like this in a long time (maybe not ever before now).\n\nIn closing, with the shelf-life of a female pop star being as short as it is (J.Lo and Hilary Duff have already come and gone in the time since Brandy's debut), it is truly refreshing to see an artist mature to the point at which everything comes together in one career-defining moment (or in this case, almost a full hour of music). One listen to the stunning a capella portion of \"Something's Missing\" is enough to convince me that there is a long term future ahead of this bright and somehow still unbelievably young talent. For all those critics who have said that Brandy has had difficulty finding her own sound in the past, take note of the fact that Brandy has responded by taking on about three different types of sounds, and mastered them all. She has finally arrived!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"How this song became almost the official anthem for Boston and the Soxs I will never understand.  Most cites want flowers, and rainbow colored unicorns to be associated with their fair or even unfair city.  But the Standells has a difference esthetic view, a naive one but they loved their town and they sang about it frustrated women and all.  The song is about the grittier side of Boston and the dirty water of the River Charles.  It is a catchy song, and like the unpolished portrait of Boston the song portrays, the sound congers up a vision of four teens hammering out a tune in a cold garage.  Yep, there are the trashcans and in a minute the drummer will have to get up and haul them out to the curb.  Directly behind them is a tool\/work bench with various tools and bits and pieces of things that are being saved because you never know when you are going to need rusted muffler for a 1961 lawn boy mower.  The boys have the door up and a gusty wind blows some autumn leaves in.  Their fingers are cold and it sometimes makes it hard to hit the cords crisply.  They have no intention to quit because each of them loves their town but they also have dreams of going beyond Boston.  They want to see sun-tanned California girls on the beech and dark Senoritas walking in bunches in the Cordoba Plaza on their way to the  Cruces de Mayo.  They have dreams of sitting and drinking coffee with pale french women smoking and talking of abuses of the government.  And I can hear this in the song and what I know that they didn't know is this song will carry them to the places they dream of and many more.  To Dick Dodd good-bye.  You recently relocated to the big mousetrap in the sky and you knew you would be received even if you did not wear white.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"The Fabulous Swing Collection is one of the better single CD compilations we have of great swing music that took the country by storm in the 1930s and 1940s. This music still sounds great today; and many people have fond memories of the times they danced to these tunes when they were often performed live in dance halls and nightclubs. The quality of the sound is really rather good and I like the artwork.\n\nBenny Goodman & His Orchestra open things up with a great rendition of \"Don't Be That Way (Take 1).\" The horn works very well for this number and Benny's band never lets us down! They do this flawlessly; and it sounds great even today. Glenn Miller & His Orchestra follow with their smash hit entitled \"In the Mood.\" \"In the Mood\" is a number people remember well; this got lots of air play and many people danced to it back in the day. Similarly, \"Opus One\" by Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra never disappoints; \"Opus One\" is a peppy little number that packs a huge, unforgettable punch and I always like hearing \"Opus One.\"\n\nGlen Gray & His Orchestra (with whom I'm less familiar) also make good with their hit, \"Casa Loma Stomp.\" \"Casa Loma Stomp\" has a great beat and they never play a superfluous note! Great! Of course, we can't have a swing CD without the great Duke Ellington and his buddies doing their wonderful \"Take the `A' Train;\" \"Take the `A' Train\" hit the clubs big time and when you hear it you'll instantly know why. A personal favorite of mine is \"Minnie the Moocher\" by the incomparable Cab Calloway & His Cotton Club Orchestra; Cab Calloway could really swing and that Cotton Club was all the better off for it!\n\nListen also for \"Back Bay Shuffle\" by Artie Shaw & His Orchestra; Artie Shaw instinctively knew how to make great music and \"Back Bay Shuffle\" showcases his talents nicely. There's even a special number from Glenn Miller again when he and his buddies play \"A String Of Pearls.\" \"A String Of Pearls\" sounds like pearls should sound--and that's quite all right by me. \"Swingin' Uptown\" by Jimmie Lunceford & His Orchestra is great; but they could have omitted \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" by Fletcher Henderson & His Orchestra. Oh, well--no CD is perfect.\n\nThe CD ends very nicely. We get two solid numbers, \"Flyin' Home\" performed by Charlie Barnet & His Orchestra and then \"Sing, Sing, Sing (With A Swing) (Parts 1 & 2)\" by Benny Goodman & His Orchestra. \"Sing, Sing, Sing (With A Swing) (Parts 1 & 2)\" is classic swing music at its very apex and I think you'll like it very much if you haven't heard this one before.\n\nThis album is a great starter CD for people just getting into swing music; and it makes an affordable single CD swing music compilation, too. If you like this you should consider other CDs of swing music available for sale on this website.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Many people cite The Love I Lost, from late 1973-early 1974 as the first disco song. It has all the elements from the disco beat to the use of strings. I would say the Trammps with Zing Went the Strings of My Heart had all the disco elements down including the strings, and that was in late 1972, over a year earlier. But the Trammps song was minor and The Love I Lost was a huge mega-hit, so it's known to far more people. Disco evolved out of the Philly sound of Gamble and Huff, and taht's who Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes recorded for.\n\nBut forget labels like disco anyway (some people don't like the term), and what you've got is a smooth orchestra, a driving rhythm and Teddy Pendergrass singing his heart out. It's a great R&B classic and is as fresh today as it was when it was released. There was a long version on the album, but that just had an extended interlude for dancing because dance music was expected to be more than a three minute AM tune. But for just listening I think the single is better as the dance interlude gets a bit repetitious on the long version if you're just listening. It deserves to be in this collection.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I bought this album digitally on Black Friday for two reasons - (1) Ne-Yo is at the head of the pack of young guys whose music I love so whenever I find out he's releasing new music, I get it & (2) it was $3.99 (gotta save $ where I can given my music fetish).\n\nI loved the lead single & video, CHAMPAGNE LIFE.  It is such a joyous track and makes me want to get up and dance every time I hear it.  He then quickly released BEAUTIFUL MONSTER & I hated the track so didn't quite know what to expect of the rest of the album.  I was also a little troubled by Ne-Yo's comments after the album under-performed, I have a pet peeve about artists who don't stand behind their work - it makes me feel like I wasted my $$ supporting their effort.\n\nI appreciate the comments from other posters regarding his desire to present this project as a movie so now those videos make sense. It's a shame that the label rushed him and nixed that idea because I think it could've worked - it's a concept that no one else is doing currently & the songs told a story & tied into one another but given the skittish nature of record labels these days it's unsurprising that any type of creativity is stifled while artists are pushed to create the same 'ol music as every other artist.  I also wonder if he'd gotten other promotion - like a BET or MTV \"making of\" documentary that could've reached more people to explain the concept and also to alert people that the album was dropping.\n\nI like this album a lot more than I did BECAUSE OF YOU.  The lyrics are strong as is the music production.  I love 7 out of the 10 songs so that's a great purchase in my book! Songs I keep on repeat:\n\nCHAMPAGNE LIFE\n\nCRAZY LOVE - it has a similar sound to Lauryn Hill's THE SWEETEST THING but Ne-Yo definitely made the song his own.  The assist from Fabolous is terrific, his flow and lyrics perfectly match the song without overpowering it\n\nKNOW YOUR NAME, ONE IN A MILLION & TELEKINESIS (a sexy slow jam)\n\nWHAT HAVE I DONE & GENUINE ONLY - the production & vocal arrangements of each track is very Michael Jackson-esque to me.  Not a bad thing given Ne-Yo's admiration for MJ\n\nMy ok tracks are CAUSE I SAID SO (an uptempo track that also reminds me of a MJ track) & MAKIN' A MOVIE (not a bad track it just didn't resonate with me the way the others did)\n\nFinally the only track I dislike is BEAUTIFUL MONSTER.\n\nAs I've previously stated about other r&b artists who had disappointing sales last year - I hope that Ne-Yo doesn't jump onto a musical genre for his next album just because it's hot and abandons the audience that loves his work. This album is really good (imho) and just didn't get the promotion it deserved (like the rest of the r&b artists last year - unfortunately).","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"\"Rumours\" probably forever ruined the old tried and true maxim \"no dating in the band!\" Anyone fed that line today can simply respond, \"yeah, that so didn't work for Fleetwood Mac.\" Arguably, dating, not to mention other things, in the band likely gave Fleetwood Mac an ineffable edge to help them attain unimaginable heights of popular music. An unanswerable question lingers as to how the album would have turned out had the band's relationships not gone sour. No one will ever know, of course. And that's very much OK. Because regardless of the emotional miasma, drama, drugs and whatever else went on, the late 1970s line up of the then nearly 10 year old Fleetwood Mac released a hugely acclaimed, and not often disputed, classic rock\/pop album.\n\nNo doubt the \"real\" rumors in the press and subsequent documentaries detailing the band members' intimacies and the undoubtedly uncomfortable situation surrounding the recording of the album have contributed to this album's staying power. Everyone likes a good drama, after all, especially from a distance. This may have led to the creation of a new recording industy marketing strategy: take a collection of great songs, add interpersonal drama and a mega-hit will result. Struggling band managers may have started complaining \"Hey! Why is no one dating in this band?!? Come on! Start kissing!\" The trick, of course, remains writing a collection of great songs. And without the unquestionably great songs the drama behind the classic \"Rumours\" (spelled in the British manner for obvious reasons) probably wouldn't hold anyone's interest for too long. Many may have come to this album titillated by the drama or mesmerized by the sales figures and ended up staying for a direct emotional connection to the music.\n\nAnd this much hyperbolized, mega-selling, nearly ubiquitous and archetypal album definitely includes plenty of great songs. They mostly speak for themselves. And surprisingly they don't sound bitter or vindictive apart from a lyric here and there. Almost anyone alive and within ear distance of rock and pop radio from 1977 to the present has very likely heard many of these songs willingly or unwillingly. The generations born after the 1960s probably didn't even know that they've actually heard most of this album until they put it on. Likely they repeat, \"Oh yeah, I've heard that one! That's Fleetwood Mac?\" throughout the first listen.\n\nThe album's galloping fade up beginning, \"Second Hand News,\" pulls in helpless cochleas with the distinctive layering of Lindsey Buckingham's vocals and the nearly addictive hooks and catches between the vocals. The brain almost doesn't have time to respond before the vocals begin. The beautiful contrast of \"Dreams\" lets hungry brains know that this album isn't blandly homogenous, but unpredictable and adventurous. And the folk-rocky mostly finger-picked acoustic \"Never Going Back Again\" just adds to the sonorous intrigue. \"Don't Stop\" picks up the pace again which continues through the grinding and angry-without-being-angry \"Go Your Own Way.\" An interlude with \"Songbird\" (the only track recorded in an arena) sets the stage for the poignant and hopeful \"The Chain,\" one of the album's highlights. And that's only the first song of side two, in the language of 33 1\/3 LPs. The rest of the album maintains the momentum, ending with the intense and brooding \"Gold Dust Woman,\" supposedly about the lure of the snort. Only \"I Don't Want To Know\" and \"Oh Daddy\" come close to subpar songs, but only in contrast with the rest of the album.\n\n\"Rumours\" will likely stand for quite some time as one of the pinnacles of 1970s rock\/pop. It still hasn't gone away. Whether future generations not yet emerged from birth canals also fervently embrace it remains to be seen. But rumor has it that they just might.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Maroon 5 is no exception.\n\nIf you like this song, then you should watch the Music Video as well. I would say that it was more of the MV that created the hype rather than the pure audio track.

{"text":"Athens, Georgias masters of Americana storytelling and elevated Southern country rock songwriting return with their 13th studio album. Their twin guitars rock with an electric rural purity that turns on the lights in farmhouses everywhere. The amazingly insightful and literate lyrics from Patterson Hood & Mike Cooley put you right it the moment, invest you in the song.  These are stories of life as it happens.  Participants aren't judged, but there are plenty of comments on the political powers that turn the wheels. Musically, the band plays classic Southern guitar rock to stir the heart and soul, and they do it with an impressive mix of passion & professionalism. Reminiscent of artists like Hold Steady, Centro-Matic, Neil Young, Water Liars, Allman Brothers Band.  Every time Drive-By Truckers release a new album, you know something good and worth listening to is coming.  American Band continues that trend.  Recommended.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Using very seductive and sultry vocals, the lead singer asks Santa for all sorts of expensive things, and then explains why she deserves them.  (It's funny, but would probably earn a \"PG-13\" rating from the movie folks.) The lead singer adds a lot of emotion to her voice, but sometimes falters and gets off-key.\n\nA very happy marriage between jazz and rock, the fantastic guitar licks in the middle of the song really stand out, and make this song worth a download.","classification":4,"fold":6}

It looked for all the world that Gary Puckett and the Union Gap would be a fixture on Top 40 radio for many years to come. In September 1968 Columbia records released \"Over You\". I think this is the best record they ever made. Some times it is incredibly difficult to get over a relationship and Gary Puckett evokes all of those emotions in this tune that peaked at #7 on the pop charts.

Written by Stevie Nicks, it became the only U.S. number one hit for the group, and even today, so many years later, it remains one of their best known songs. That first LP went it's own way years later, but was replaced with a CD copy. That one still surfaces in my untidy collection now and then, but when I saw the MP3 version here, it was an instant no brainer to grab it.\n\nThat classic classic disc was the number-one album on the charts for over 30 weeks, and Rolling Stone named \"Rumours\" as the 25th greatest album of all time. Today it ranks as the 10th best-selling album ever, with more than 40 million copies sold to date, and it features four top 10 singles. \"Rumors\" won the 1977 best album Grammy, and even 35 years later, it today remains remains the band's most successful effort, and ready to be shared with yet another generation.\n\nThese are the album tracks on the MP3 version here:\n\n1. Second Hand News (LP Version); 2:53\n2. Dreams (LP Version); 4:13\n3. Never Going Back Again (LP Version); 2:15\n4. Don't Stop (LP Version); 3:13\n5. Go Your Own Way (LP Version); 3:35\n6. Songbird (LP Version); 3:23\n7. The Chain (LP Version); 4:31\n8. You Make Loving Fun (LP Version); 3:29\n9. I Don't Want To Know (LP Version); 3:15\n10. Oh Daddy (LP Version); 3:57\n11. Gold Dust Woman (LP Version); 5:02\n\nFor this listener, the only other song that I would have liked included here is&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Silver-Springs-Live-Album-Version\/dp\/B0027FZ1X2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Silver Springs (Live Album Version)<\/a>&nbsp;as it was on the 2004 remastered reissue of the album, but luckily for us, it's still available here as a single. The quality of the recordings in this MP3 version are excellent, and the carryover from the LP versions are excellent. Listen to the vocals and instrumentation and you'll see for yourself.\n\nFor newcomers to Fleetwood Mac, the group consisted of guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Buckingham, drummer Mick Fleetwood, keyboardist and vocalist Christine McVie, bassist John McVie, and vocalist Stevie Nicks. This was their eleventh studio album, and the recording sessions were marked by quite a bit of interpersonal strife between members of the group; and these experiences showed up in some of the album's lyrics. There are plenty of postings out there on the 'Net about the background behind this album, so I won't add to them here. Needless to say, \"Rumors\"  remains the group's most successful effort, and for many it's the best album they made.\n\nAs a side note, the front cover of album featured a stylized shot of drummer Mick Fleetwood and vocalist Stevie Nicks dressed in her \"Rhiannon\" stage persona. The photograph was taken by Herbert Worthington, a friend of Stevie Nicks for over 30 years, and he and Stevie have collaborated on thousands of her best photographs over the years.\n\nDiehard fans may want to check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Making-Rumours-The-Inside-Story-of-the-Classic-Fleetwood-Mac-Album\/dp\/B007AKBINQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Making Rumours: The Inside Story of the Classic Fleetwood Mac Album<\/a>&nbsp;by Ken Caillat, the album's co-producer. He reveals the full story of what really went into making Rumours, from the endless partying and relationship dramas to the creative struggles to write and record \"You Make Loving Fun,\" \"Don't Stop,\" \"Go Your Own Way,\" \"The Chain,\" and the other timeless tracks.\n\nRead some of the other excellent and thoughtful reviews for&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Rumours\/dp\/B00123NC8G\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rumours<\/a>&nbsp;here and you'll see why so many of us consider it to be one of the best albums of this genre to have ever been made.\n\n9\/26\/2012","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"This album really has all you need from them. Candlebox is one of those bands that defiantly jumped on the Grunge band-wagon that conquered the early 90s in Alternative Music. The only problem is that they weren't as good as the bands they were most likely influenced from. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, and Soundgarden were just so much better and created a legacy in the trail they left behind. Candlebox just sort of had a moment where people enjoyed the sound of Grunge so much they were desperate for more and they heard \"Far Behind\" and instantly called it worthy. You could arguably say Candlebox is a one hit wonder, I disagree with that statement but its understandable why others might think that. What's included on this best of is really the best of what they put out. Everything here is really all you need to hear to truly see what they had to offer to music. Its a shame things didn't really work out for the band, but it probably wouldn't of mattered because its not like they put out anything that really defined a generation.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I cannot tell you the last time I actually heard Another Part of Me that wasn't a live performance on YouTube; but as my wife and I have really turned our attention to MJ and his accomplishments musically in recent days, I cannot fully explain just how exciting it is for me to pump up his music after such a long hiatus. Not that I had completely stopped listening to Mike, that would never happen. But it can become pretty routine and extremely easily to get stuck on particular favorites, keeping them on repeat, without savoring the full spectrum of his creations and collaborations. More that anything, smooth jazz is the staple of the vast majority of my music, but considering that I have trumped well over 10,000 tracks, I am knee deep into R&B\/Soul, as well. On a recent drive my wife stated she wanted to hear more Mike that anything else, and that caused me to have to go down into the cellar, into the archives if you will, and re-discover much more that I possess of his music. Another Part of Me is just one example of how BAD he really is, and in my opinion, it solidifies his position not only as the greatest entertainer ever, but the greatest singer, too. This is definitely a dance hit, if you can a way to not kick your leg high and bring your mouth and nose together in a failed attempt to mimic him! His vocal range is just awesome, and whether the music is slow and soulful or upbeat and gritty, he always gives us the right pitch to match every single hit. You can get lost in the music as it is driven to heart stopping highs to even lovelier lows, but when tracks are remastered, be sure you set your system right to just stop, and just listen. The arrangements, when discerned, will whet your appetite for more and you'll appreciate his artistry that much better. Truly, if asked, he could just simply say, \"Well, singing, like dancing, it's just Another Part of Me. OWW! .' ~K.I.S.S~","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I have long enjoyed the Woldike Saul on CD, but be forewarned that it is pretty heavily cut in comparison to more recent versions led by Gardiner and Mackerras. The Naxos version led by Martini is the most complete of all but compromised by by some unattractive singing and Germanic accents.\n\nI acquired to Somary Messiah years ago on LP when it was considered the \"last word\" in style - pre-period instruments. It features an outstanding solo quartet and good choral and orchestral work. I also have it on CD, along with the Judas Maccabeus. Alexander Young's heroic Judas is still the benchmark against which I judge his more recent rivals. Hyperion's version of Judas does, however, offer a colorful version of the score on period instruments. Deutsche Harmonia Mundi has a very pallid hero.\n\nThe Semele is OK but is outclassed in modern instrument performances by Nelson's DG version with Kathleen Battle in the title role. Nelson also offers more of the music as does Curnyn (with period instruments) on Chandos Chaconne although Rosemary Joshua's singing in the title role has drawn mixed response. (I happen to like it.)  Gardiner recorded a somewhat cut version on Erato that is well sung and played on period instruments. With the upheavals in the classical recording industry over the past few years, any or all of the CD based versions may be difficult to find.\n\nThe Jephtha is also a good performance that I've owned on Vanguard Cardinal LPs for years. It has serious rivals in more recent period performance offerings but Helen Watts' over the top Storge is still worth the price of admission - along with Young. (I bought the present set to supplement the noisy LP surfaces of the Cardinal pressings. I also have the Theodora on CD and it has held up well despite Maureen Lehane's lack of a trill (as Irene) and Maureen Forrester's sometimes hooty vocal production.\n\nAt the price, you can't go wrong.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Singer\/songwriter Amel Larrieux initially made her debut as one-half of Groove Theory. She created the group with rapper turned producer Bryce Wilson- a former member of the electro hip hop group Mantronix. From there, they recorded their lone self-titled debut for Epic Records. Shortly after the release of the album, Wilson and Larrieux fought over the group's direction. As a result, they parted ways in the middle of recording what would have been their sophomore album. While Bryce went looking for a replacement, Amel soldiered on with a solo career- releasing \"Infinite Possibilities\" in 2000. The album was critically acclaimed, but it wasn't as commercial as Epic would have liked. So Amel went independent on her sophomore effort- 2003's \"Bravebird\", which yielded her biggest hit \"For Real\". She returned in 2006 with the underrated \"Morning\" and the long talked about jazz covers record \"Lovely Standards\" the following year.\n\nAfter a six year absence, Amel returned in 2013 with \"Ice Cream Everyday\". Much like her studio albums in the past, her newest recording was produced by her husband Laru Larrieux. It's a noticeable change for Amel, as she incorporates live instrumentation into her electronica styled R&B. She also made what has to be the lengthiest album in her recorded history at sixteen songs. She leads the album with \"Afraid\", followed by the percussive, piano driven \"A Million Sapphires\". Much like her previous ballad \"Make Me Whole\", the track \"I Do Take\" is a potential wedding song. She deals with being friend-zoned from a woman's perspective on \"You Don't See Me\", while getting sensual on the industrial ballad \"Berries & Cream\". She warns of a suspicious character on \"Danger\", and explores the negative power of words on \"Moment To Reflect\". She addresses the moments of being clumsy on \"Have You \" and channels the Minneapolis sound on \"Orange Glow\". On \"See Where You Are\", she gets people to examine where they are in their lives, while reluctantly giving in to love on \"Don't Let Me Down\". \"Ice Cream Everyday\" is another solid effort from Amel Larrieux. It may not be a radio friendly album, but no one has ever accused her of not challenging her listeners.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Martin Gore has made several solo EPs and albums apart from his work in Depeche Mode, and most of his solo work has been pretty different and distinct from the DM sound.  This latest full Gore album, simply titled *MG*, is a collection of relatively abstract electronic themes.  The sixteen pieces of music on the album usually have melodies and rhythms, but they are less clearly defined than DM songs are.  These tracks are much more about the unusual synth sounds Mr. Gore is able to create than making \"songs.\"  Many of the themes contain angelic layers of harmonic chords --  on \"Stealth,\" for instance -- but those synths are in service of pulsing\/blurping and more aggressive electronics.  Then there are pieces like the very next one, \"Hum,\" which are all about buzzing drones with minimal rhythms.  I'm sure that's the kind of sounds Gore was talking about when he used the description \"Sci-Fi\" in recent interviews.  This album is very cool for fans of instrumental electronic music (like me), but not for people who want songs they can sing along with.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Coming off of a classic first album, we see that Sister Arie remains a fine musician\/singer and the music on this new disc definitely showcases her talents on these fronts.  The grooves swing, the album is mixed incredibly tight and the arrangements are great. The changes are solid and the vocals even better than on her first record.\nBut you know how an artist's intentions can be TOO clear?  The messages too in-your-face?  How a poem or song or book can make you TOO conscious of the fact that you're partaking in listening or reading and not simply allowing the art to flow over you and take you away?  That's what's wrong here.\nThe problem I have is with the lyrics: they're WAY too preachy.\nI thought that the music was so well-done that I would be able to circumvent the lyrics here and there just to have something to groove to like I do with half the stuff on the radio, but that's turned out to not be the case.  A song will come in with a great beat, great harmonizing and great arrangements for about 20 seconds and then you're inundated with Sunday School-level lessons for three minutes.  Where's the risk-taking of \"Brown Skin\" or the gutsy self-confidence of \"Video\"?  Where's the humanity of \"Ready for Love\" or the philisophical punch of \"I See God In You\"?  It's just not there this time around.  It's almost as if she's heard so many people tell her that her first record was so positive that it's hamstrung her from taking too many chances on this record with the messages.  This album is cursed with the kind of \"We Are the World\" heavy-handedness that ruined the better part of the Lauryn Hill live record earlier this year.\nGreat playing mired in WAY heavy-handed and too-simple lyrics.  The musical equivalent of an Iyanla Vanzant seminar, which is unfortunate because her first album was a classic and a much-needed shot in the arm of a musical arena saturated with negativity.  This, however, is too far at the other end of the love\/hate spectrum.  If I wanted a gospel album, I'd have bought a gospel album.  She's clearly fallen in love since the last record as well, which is fine, but because of that there's a lot of not-great sap here too.  Not even racy, midnight-mood, slow-jammy sap...it's just simplistic I'm-in-love type stuff that, lyrically, you could get anywhere.\nThe shining track here is \"The One\" but it's not enough to justify buying the record if you liked the risks and confidence of her first record.  This is all a terrible shame; I wanted to like this one, especially after the constant robbing of Arie by the year of (groan) Alicia Keyes, but this record falls short in the most important department: the message.","classification":3,"fold":6}

I come running back to you, you push me away, you push, you push me away.\" Off The Wall gave us She's Out of My Life and the real tears at the end of the song. I am not sure if it has ever been revealed as to whom the 'she' is that he is referring to, Then, then there came Thriller and MAN!, it is STILL thrilling us! The flow from beginning to end has perfect placement and when we arrive at its conclusion, \"There'll be no darkness tonight, Lady our love will shine (Lighting the night), Just put your trust in my heart and meet me in paradise (Now is the time), Girl, you're every wonder in this world to me, A treasure time won't steal away~So listen to my heart, Lay your body close to mine, Let me fill you with my dreams, I can make you feel alright, And baby through the years gonna love you more each day, So I promise you tonight that you will always be the lady in my life.\" And some people had the nerve to call this dude gay, and I do not mean happy.

{"text":"Volbeat's sound is very recognizable, now more than ever thanks to heavy rotation on the radio. Songs like \"Heaven nor Hell\" and \"Lola Montez\" catapulted this group to mainstream status in a major way. However, they also seem to have resulted in less heavy riffs and more towards melodic hard rock. Outlaw Gentlemen and Shady Ladies was where this transformation really got started, even though the group has always had its share of melodic hard rock. There were generally more heavy riffs. Outlaws Gentlemen had some good riffs on tracks like \"Dead But Rising\", \"The Hangman's Body Count\", and \"Doc Holiday\", but in general was pretty much melodic hard rock. This album follows that trend, but even further in my opinion. Tracks such as \"The Devils Bleading Crown\" and \"The Loa's Crossroad\"  bookend the disc on somewhat heavy notes, but everything in between is catchy melodic hard rock. Sadly this group is falling into Nickelback status with how formulated their albums are becoming. Their one saving grace is they aren't doing cheesy love songs. The riffs and vocals though are becoming too similar with each disc. I understand the \"if it's not broken, don't fix it\" mentality. It's worked for many mainstream bands, but it does wear thin on those who would like a bit more creativity. Not talking about reinvention or anything, because that often leads to even more backlash, but something to mix things up a bit would be nice in the furture.","classification":3,"fold":6}

With that being said, I was a little skeptical about this album after she released We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.  While the song is very catchy and I do sing along to it, it's definitely not one of my favorite singles from her.  I can't stand the part where she is talking in the middle of it, but that's just me.  Other people love the song.  I have been listening to the deluxe version of this album for a few days now and I have to be honest, I couldn't even tell you one song that has truly stuck out to me as being a favorite.  They all sound so similar and somewhat boring to me.  There are several songs where the lyrics are very very repetitive which borderline annoying to me.  Overall, it's a decent album but a very disappointing follow up to Speak Now.  But I still love Taylor.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"Ever since the early days of MTV, I started falling in love with Cyndi Lauper's music.  She was NOT like any other artist out there.  She was wacky, creative, quirky, fashionable (check out her various outfits) and didn't take herself so seriously.  And that New Yawk accent!!!  Quite simply, Cyndi just wanted to have fun.  But before she became a megastar on the pop map, she had previously fronted a rock band called Blue Angel.  They put out their first and ONLY record in 1980.  It really IS worth checking out.\n\nOnce Cyndi became an actual solo artist, her first order of business (aside from being on MTV) was to recruit another band called The Hooters.  They helped her launch 5 mega smashes on her 1983 debut, \"She's So Unusual.\"  First, there is the opener, \"Money Changes Everything.\"  Cyndi showed the world who was boss and that she wasn't going anywhere.  Next was the most important staple, \"Girls Just Want To Have Fun.\"  The whole indescribable nature of the song was what got her noticed in the first place (most notably on Dick Clark's American Bandstand).  Then there was the much more serious ballad \"Time After Time\", which remains one of my personal favorites to this day.  This album was only the tip of the iceberg of what would catapult Cyndi's 30 year career longevity.\n\nIn 1985, she released 2 tracks for The Goonies movie:  the theme song (\"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough\") and the much faster rocker, \"What A Thrill.\"  A year later, Cyndi spread out her artistic talent even further with \"True Colors.\"  Each song was a hit on its own, and Cyndi had A LOT of guest stars (The Bangles, Billy Joel, Aimee Mann, and even Pee Wee Herman).  The title track and accompanying video is another one of my personal faves.\n\nIn 1988, another minor hit:  \"Hole In My Heart (All The Way To China)\" from the movie Vibes.  It's a VERY elusive song to find, if that is even possible.  I actually got it from an 80's compilation disc on eBay several years ago.  It's just one of those feel good songs that you really need to have!!!\n\nNext came 1989's \"A Night To Remember\".  Cyndi was becoming much more serious as a songwriter and performer.  \"I Drove All Night\" had a much more rock feel to it, and it proved that Cyndi was indeed evolving.  Sadly, this was the only real hit on her record; in hindsight, the rest of the songs deserved MUCH more appreciation and should not have been cast aside.  What about \"Unconditional Love\" or \"Heading West\"??\n\nIn the 90's, Cyndi would release 3 more records.  By that time, she was getting even deeper into her artistry and would even release some non-album tracks.  For example, you may be familiar with the ethereal 1992's \"The World Is Stone.\"  In 1993, Cyndi re-teamed with the Hooters for some delicious tracks on \"Hat Full Of Stars.\"  There were, again, some minor hits:  \"That's What I Think\", \"Who Let In The Rain?\", and the lilting, hushed title track which is still another of my personal faves.  Unfortunately, the album wasn't getting the right amount of airplay.  But that never stopped Cyndi at all.  She kept having great song after song.\n\nIn 1995, Cyndi released her first greatest hits record, \"Twelve Deadly Cyns.\"  I loved the candy coated, luscious album cover, and so 3 new songs were added to Cyndi's ever growing repertoire:  \"I'm Gonna Be Strong\" (this was an updated version of the 1980 Blue Angel track), \"(Hey Now) Girls Just Want To Have Fun\" (a sequel to the 1983 megasmash), and \"Come On Home.\"\n\nBy 1996, this was when Cyndi was at her peak and had started to re-invent herself.  She wanted to be an ARTIST, not a \"hits\" maker.  On \"Sisters Of Avalon\", Cyndi went all over the map (but in a very good way, mind you).  There's the forceful, in your face title track.  2 other minor hits also took notice:  \"Ballad Of Cleo & Joe\" and \"Unhook The Stars.\"  Sadly, this particular album was one of her most underappreciated.\n\nOverall, this \"greatest hits\" CD covers Cyndi Lauper's timespan from 1983 to 1996.  Since then, Cyndi would release 6 more albums in 1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2008 and 2010.  No two records were EVER the same.  And that brings me to the 3 reasons that Cyndi is MY favorite female artist of all time.  One:  She created albums on her OWN terms and wouldn't conform to the record companies.  Two:  She played various instruments -- whatever she could find, she would put to use!  And three:  many of the songs were very euphoric and would make a person feel good about himself\/herself.\n\nSo, if anyone is having a bad day, all you need to do is put on a Cyndi Lauper record and learn how to have fun.  I'm sure glad that I did!!!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"No doubt about it. When Motown pulled up stakes and moved the bulk of its operations to the West Coast in the early 1970's the center of gravity in the world of soul music shifted dramatically. But it did not, as the executives at Motown had hoped, follow them to Los Angeles. Rather, the new capitol of soul music was located about 450 miles to the south and east of Detroit in the City of Brotherly Love. For it was just about that same time that producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff in conjunction with CBS founded Philadelphia International Records. It would go on to become the dominant soul label for the next decade featuring artists like Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes, Billy Paul, The Three Degrees and so many others. But clearly the most important and successful group to record for Philadelphia International was The O'Jays.\n\nNow before signing with Philadelphia International in 1972 The O'Jays had been around the block a time or two. The group was formed in 1961 and was originally known as The Triumphs. The group was renamed by Cleveland disc jockey Eddie O'Jay.  During the 1960's The O'Jays amassed a total of 10 charted singles but none made a huge splash on the Billboard Hot 100.  That would all change in July 1972 with the release of \"Backstabbers\" which would peak at #3.  It quickly became apparent that Gamble & Huff knew how to best utilize the talents of this venerable group and several more hits would follow over the next few years.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Yeah, the '80s may have watered it down with excessive layers of synthesizers and the general favoring of style over substance. Sure, the '90s have all but stomped it out due to the ubiquitous presence of hip-hop's \"dark\" side (heavily-programmed instruments, blatant sampling, offensive lyrics, bad singing). However, thanks to budding artists like Kem Owens, soul music has finally come around full-circle after 20+ years of musical diarrhea.\n\nKem's sparkling debut should truly set the standard in terms of what to look for in good soul music: REAL INSTRUMENTS (played by REAL MUSICIANS, of course), REAL SONGS (inspired, meaningful lyrics and solid composition skills), and REAL SINGING ABILITY (knowing HOW to sing in addition to having vocal talent). If more and more artists today would just adhere to these relatively simple guidelines, then there wouldn't be so much bad music out there to begin with. An album containing a few hit singles and a load of filler doesn't do it for me. That's why I'm recommending 'Kemistry' to ANYONE who honestly craves good music without the hype to go with it.\n\np.s. It's no wonder why most reviewers on here keep giving this album 5 stars.

{"text":"From the second that I heard \"Tell Me\" & \"Keep Tryin'\", I was sold on any and everything Amel Larrieux. I purchased the CD singles but for some reason I had never picked up the CD. I was going through a female friend of mine's CD collection in college and I was like, \"Yeah, I'm going to have to rough this Groove Theory from you for a minute so I can listen to it.\" Obviously, when I listened to the CD, I was upset that I hadn't bought it when it was originally released. My favorite song ended up being Amel's remake of The Isley Brothers' \"Hello It's Me\" but I also liked songs such as \"Hey U\", \"Good To Me\", \"Ride\", etc. I was looking forward to hearing future projects from them but after I heard \"Never Enough\" on The Love Jones soundtrack, that would be the last song that I would heard from them. Groove Theory broke up and Amel went solo. Her first CD ended up being \"Infinite Possibilities\". This CD was in heavy rotation for more than a minute. I enjoyed songs such as \"Get Up\", \"I n I\" and \"Sweet Misery\" but the album's closer \"Makes Me Whole\" ended up being my favorite song. Amel went on to release \"Bravebird\", \"Morning\" and \"Lovely Standards\". During this time my favorite Amel song \"For Real\" was released on \"Bravebird\" and I did like other songs such as \"No One Else\", \"Weary\" and others but I didn't enjoy those albums as much as I did \"Groove Theory\" and \"Infinite Possibilities\".\n\n\"Ice Cream Everyday\" was released on October 1st. After listening to this CD, I have no problem with saying that Amel is officially back. I can't say that she ever left but this is clearly her best CD since \"Infinite Possibilities\". Songs like \"Afraid\", \"Urrr The Shhhh\", \"Moment To Reflect\", \"A Million Sapphires\" and my favorite, \"I Do Take\", will make anyone see what I'm talking about. She even includes the songs \"Orange Glow\" and \"Don't Let Me Down\", which had been songs that Amel had released since 2007's \"Lovely Standards\" CD.\n\nHighsmith's Top 5\n\n1) I Do Take\n2) Afraid\n3) A Million Sapphires\n4) Urrr The Shhhh\n5) Moment To Reflect","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Outside of Born To Run & Darkness On The Edge Of Town, Bruce Springsteen's back catalog has been woefully neglected.  No other major artist of his caliber's back catalog had been failed to be remastered over the years and fans were left with poor recordings in the digital era.  Thankfully now that oversight has been remedied.  The Album Collection Vol. 1 1973-1984 remasters the first eight studio albums in the Boss' career and the results are spectacular.  Just listen to the infamously poorly mastered The Wild, The Innocent & The E Shuffle and you will instantly hear the improvement.  The once muddy sound has been wiped clean and it is now bright, crisp and lively.  The jazzy overtones of the album shine through.  The River has also suffered from poor mastering and it too sounds fresh and exciting.  Nebraska was recorded on a four track cassette originally, so there is only so much you can do with the sound, but the producers has pumped up the sound and reduced the hiss which greatly improved the sound.  Born In The USA finally captures the massive, arena rock ready soul of the album while keeping true to the darker elements of the lyrics.  Even the previously remastered Born To Run and Darkness On The Edge Of Town are worth owning in the newly remastered forms.  Obviously they aren't the quantum leaps in sound over the other albums, but they sound improved as well.  Here's hoping there is a collection Vol. 2 which will include the Live album and Tunnel of Love which also need attention.  The packaging is first rate as well.  The cd are replicas of the original albums right down to the dust sleeves.  Greetings has the post card flap on the front and the sleeve touts other Columbia releases of the day, the separate lyric sheets are in Darkness, The River & BITUSA.  Plus the collection booklet boasts some impressive pictures.","classification":5,"fold":6}

The upbeat \"Absence Of Affection\" has the unforgettable chorus \"In the absence of affection, we'll take anything and call it love\", while \"Things You Said\" is catchy with a spoken segment \"You wanna be loved by someone, then love someone...\" The ballad \"Paper Dolls\" is a dark and trippy duet, followed by the moody \"Nlytm\" (Not Like You Told Me). \"Heaven Help Me\" is sunny and upbeat, while closing cut \"Pieces\" is a tender piano\/string ballad allowing his vocals to soar.\n\nIf you liked Adam Lambert or Brandon Flowers' recent albums, this should be right up your alley.","classification":4,"fold":6}

To top that off the song is not sung well, Katy again proves she cannot sing on this track even with all the digital effects producers have added to try to hide this obvious fact. While it is leaps and bounds above the quality of her previous songs off her horrible album \"Teenage Dream\" it is not a good song overall. It is merely ok at best due to the fact that at least it is not filled with extremely immature sexual lyrics...the beat is ok but completely unoriginal and blends in with almost every other single song in the genre released currently.\nWith so much better songs to listen to, i.e. this is easily something that should be passed on.

{"text":"I have had this one for thirteen years, enjoying a love\/hate relationship with it. Half the cuts I can live without, and the other half is essential to every collection. To give you an idea of where my tastes lie, I have always hated the bubble gum pop prior to their drug-inspired hippie days. I have also considered them to be highly over-rated, since my tastes in progressive music leaned towards early Yes and Genesis. Many would say that the Beatles introduced art and creativity into rock, albeit with drugs as their vehicle. Yes, this is true, but so many other groups took this much further. With that in mind, this set and the stellar Abbey Road was all that I needed for many years. Then the Yellow Submarine Songtrack was released, which brought back memories of many trippy midnight movies. I consider that one to be a much better and cheaper introduction to the best of The Beatles, since it represents some of their best from late 1965 to early 1969, with only a few new songs (when it was released). So I have sufficed with just three Beatles releases up until now.\n\nWell, I got to wondering today on how much it would cost to add some more good Beatles songs to my collection. For my tastes, this was surprisingly affordable. This also led me to identify why I have the love\/hate relationship with this collection, which also had put me off with the Beatles in general for all these years. All of my own favorite cuts are not represented enough here, and too many of the overplayed and annoying cuts are on this one. I have finally decided to complete my Beatles collection of favorites and donate this puppy to my girlfriend.\n\nSo if your tastes run similar to mine, here is what I recommend in chronological order. Start off with Past Masters Volume 2 (which contains all of the 1965-1970 non-album singles), then Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, Yellow Submarine Songtrack, The White Album, and Abbey Road. I will throw in Let It Be just for the sake of completion.  I plan to make my own compilation for my car and leave all of my hated cuts off. Judging from most of the reviews, all Beatles fans need to do the same, since no one compilation can satisfy anyone. They put out a lot of good stuff, but due to their willingness to experiment, they could never satisfy everyone. A lot of their later stuff even makes me cringe, but a lot of it still stands the test of time forty years later.\n\nIf you want a good compilation to start with, try the Yellow Submarine Songtrack, but not this one.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"Teena Marie's excellent \"Beautiful\" is the final musical work of \"the Ivory Queen of Soul\" who left us too soon at age 54. Recorded in her home studio, it was brought to completion after her passing by her talented daughter Alia Rose who also sings on two of the tracks. It is a fitting posthumous musical epitaph to Lady T's four decade career and almost sounds like she was looking back with \"Wild Horses\" from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Passion-Play\/dp\/B00000E9LP\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Passion Play<\/a>&nbsp;CD and looking towards the future with \"Rare Breed\" (with Alia Rose) and \"Beautiful\", all showing she was at the top of her singing, musician, and songwriting abilities. At age 54 many singers are reminiscing with their 'greatest hits', but Teena had already 'reloaded' with \"Beautiful\". And it is full of smoking soul, hip R&B, beautiful ballads, and latin-tinged swingers that show off her crystal clear, multi-range voice. The 'best of the best' begins with classic-sounding, multi-tracked \"Luv Letter\", the mellow \"Carte Blanche\", and the latin-tinged swinging ballad \"Definition of Down\", while the hip 'spoken word' intro to the intense ballad \"The Long Play\" will tug at the heartstrings of long-time Teena Marie fans.

Curtis Mayfield's SuperFly movie classic \"Give Me Your Love\" with Alia Rose is lovely and sensual. This surprise recording caught nearly everyone off guard when the announcement was made in November that it existed and it is a timeless \"Beautiful\" musical posthumous gift from Teena Marie, produced through a labor of love by Alia Rose.

I thought that Jason Isbell's previous album \"Southeastern\" was the best thing he had done to date, but this new batch of songs is so outstanding that I think THIS is the one that now ranks as his best.\n\nI won't go into detail about the songs except to say that they are all --- yes, every single one of them --- very strong compositions. Isbell has a way with both words and melodies, and he wraps them all in an emotionally powerful vocal delivery. Honestly, some of these songs are just chillingly good, guaranteed to move the most jaded of souls. And yeah, let's not forget the quality of the musicians, including Isbell himself who plays some impressive electric and slide guitar. Good? This guy is great!\n\nNeedless to say, if you've followed Isbell's solo career thus far, or if you enjoyed his contributions to the Drive-By Truckers, you'll want to hear this new album too. This truly is a masterwork!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I was lucky enough to first see James Taylor live in a small outdoor venue  called Avaloch in rural Lenox, Massachusetts in the summer of 1970, after  this first album recorded by the Beatles in London had been released and  just before the release of the fabulously successful \"Sweet Baby James\"  album by Warner Brothers. He appeared alone on-stage with a full head of  long, long hair in a simple denim shirt and cut-up jeans with his four or  five acoustic guitars, and for two and a half hours proceeded to absolutely  enchant the sprawling lawn-full of hundreds of audience members with a  spellbinding performance of all of the work from both of those albums.  Although virtually unknown at the time, word of mouth had spread so quickly  in the Berkshires area (who still considers him one of their own) that many  of us went out to get this album to play before he appeared. The rest, as  they say, is history.\nThis is a fantastic retrospective collection of  his greatest hits recorded live, and as one would expect of the amazing Mr.  Taylor, it is a terrific summary of that work. Many of my favorites are  here, including \"Something In The Way She Moves\", \"Carolina In My Mind\",  and \"Rainy Day Man\". Of course, so is \"Fire And Rain\", \"You've Got A  Friend\", \"Steamroller Blues\", and a wonderful combination of \"Millworker\"  and \"Country Road\", which are both among the best songs he has ever  written.  My all time favorite song from this album is \"Sweet Baby James\",  which is sung about the Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts where I  grew up, so I have always considered this a special song.  His performance  on it is a brilliant illustration of just how incredibly talented an  interpretive artist Taylor really is. He always pleases with songs like  \"Copperline\", \"Mexico\", and \"Walking Man\", and this album is sure to please  even the most cautious music fan. It is certainly a terrific showcase for  how well Taylor can deliver on a variety of original works and covers of  traditional folk songs. Enjoy","classification":5,"fold":6}

Someone actually complained of how these songs were, among other things, out of tune and unpolished.  Well, what did you think they were?  That's why they're called HOME RECORDINGS!

Then again, I wasn't terribly surprised given the wildly uneven quality of Prince's release over the last decade or so.\n\nHearing the original single mix (or the original extended mix, whatever - it's track one here), the tune grew on me a bit. It's just a harmless little pop rocker. It has an oddly \"clean\" sound - reminds me a lot of \"The One U Wanna C\" from Planet Earth (though not as fun).\n\nThe remixes though are kind of a waste of time. For the price of the maxi-single download, I say might as well. You're not saving much money by just getting the Original Extended Mix. The Original Radio Edit is okay too, but I stick with the longer version if I'm going to listen to it. The Jamie Lewis mixes try to turn this into some kind of a club banger, but the mild pop production of the original song doesn't lend itself well to this approach.","classification":2,"fold":6}

Hard to believe he and Bernie Taupin will be soon celebration 50 years of remarkable songwriting at the soul. But very rarely Elton John has done songwriting away from Bernie Taupin and worked with others. That has been the case with Tim Rice & The Lion King, or Gary Osbourne, whom had written a few classic gems with Elton that have been with his status. Blue Eyes is absolutely one of those classic songs. The song shows a midnight contemporary soul that swoons at the heart. From Elton, it not only came a hit, but from Elton it came out at a time when his music wasn't being fashionable in the 80's. Elton was still under heartbreak from when he came out in the 70's as a gay musician, and he was finding himself again in a era where MTV was beginning.

{"text":"This new one from foxy puts her back where she left off on Ill na na(her first cd) but in a whole new way. A lot of people thought she would fall off or come back weak on this but she came from left field with some of these tracks. This time she brought a lot of reggae, dancehall, some soca and even indian music to the plate. Some of the tightest tracks on this is where she raps with dancehall beats. Hearing foxy chant in jamacian puts her on a whole different level now and no other female mc right now can do it better. The way that she flows from rap to reggae makes it look a lot easier than it is. There is one song call \"so Hot\" where she shows her trini roots with a calypso style beat that sounds different to anything out now. Bk Anthem has one of the hardest and tightest beats that you can play on the set. On songs the leter she apologizes to her family and different people she hurt. On broken silence she lets you knwo what she has been goign through all this time. Fallin and 730 pust some rumors to an end liek jay-z writing some of her rhymes. She admits it saying \"Yeah I did, but I blew um up the same\". \"Tables will turn\" is anotehr tight song that I think is on of the tightest on the cd...produced by regage producer Dave kelly. In regage dave kelly is the equivalent of timbaland in hip-hop so she couldn't get any better with him. The songs I like the most are: Oh Yeah, Bk Anthem, The letter, 730, tables will turn, hood scriptures, run dem, na na be like, so hot, and teh saddest day.

{"text":"This is one of the most important albums in recent time, much has been said about how it changed the music world and can never be changed back, and other great pathos. Well, that is true to an extent, before 'Nirvana' and the rise of alternative rock, music was considerably more cheesy (or romantic) and was less willing to explore darker more disillusioned themes. They also opened up a whole new chapter in popular music because so many alternative rock bands who's style of music was not popular before this were now able to get mass exposure.\n\nBut I mean, what, with all these guys with hair down to their knees, bragging about everyone they could get laid with and how cool their sunglasses and cars are, if some little guy comes along going 'I'm so crap, I don't deserve to be alive', well, he seems refreshing, like a much needed change of pace.\n\nAs for the music itself, it is enjoyable. Nirvana have a disaffected atittude, and blend dissonant and major key melodies with a powerful, rocking delivery. This is also where the band perfected the soft verse heavy chorus technique.\n\nSo the opening song, 'Smells like teen spirit' is a powerful rock song with that unforgettable riff. This song has a slight 'sinister' atmosphere to it. The other big hit off this was 'Come as you are', an acoustic song that had a good chorus effect. These were the only two Nirvana songs I'd heard before I bought the album. When I heard the rest of the album I was surprised at how 70's the rest of the songs sounded, which I wasn't expecting. Also, these were the only two songs that used guitar effects (other than distortion). For example 'Breed' was an energetic rocker that almost feels like classic rock, and 'In Bloom' is a melodious song that also has a bit of classic rock feeling and slightly country sounding. The raved up 'Territorial pissings' is possibly the most pure punk song that the band ever did, at least it is on this album. Most of the tracks rock pretty hard and have plenty of energy, except the acoustic 'Polly' and the haunting ballad 'Something in the way', which has good vocal harmonies and a cello!\n\nOn the weaknesses of this album, well, Kurt Cobain's slurred lyrics are supposed to be a breakthrough, but I would disagree. It's like saying praising a guitarist for not being able to play guitar or a drummer for not being able to play the drums. Sometimes you don't really understand what is being said, particularly on 'Drain You' and 'Lounge Act'. Also, some of the songs are a bit repetitive, and wear thin on repeated listens.\n\nAnyway, it's an a good listen, interesting, and, as you know, highly influential. ***","classification":3,"fold":6}

Mariah Carey had so much talent in the 90's and in the 2000 decade when she released The Emancipation of Mimi, but these days the talent has been more wasted in heart. The music on her most recent album Me I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse has been more of a waste of time, and far departure considering the end of her own marriage to Nick Cannon, and the lack of drive in her recent works. Thirsty, the lead single from the album is absolutely one of her worst songs she has recorded in years. It is definitely a lack of time that she couldn't electrify in her own soul, and lags what she showed in songs like We Belong Together and It's Like That. She honestly lagged a real rhythm from her own heart and the upbeat songs she used to deliver, makes me want to go to her earlier works, when her voice was strong and when she used to have talent.

{"text":"When I was 11 years old(1967) I attended a Monkees concert on this tour,and certainly,these 4 concerts are true to what I remember hearing at The Miami Beach Convention Hall(yes,I was at one of the 6 shows where Jimi Hendrix was one of the warmup acts).What you get in this 4 disc set are 3 concerts professionally recorded on 4-track by RCA engineer Hank Cicalo and one mono soundboard tape from Mobile,Alabama recorded by one of the group's roadies. The Mobile tape sounds somewhat better here than on bootleg editions. The primary fault is with the group's performances. As we all know,the Monkees were singer\/actors hired to portray musicians,and on the group's first 2 studio albums,98% of the instruments were played by sessionmen. Even if Mickey Dolenz(Drums),Mike Nesmith(guitar),Peter Tork(Bass,electric piano.organ) & Davy Jones(tambourine) had been better players,they were in a no-win situation,trying to play songs from the first 2 albums,which featured up to 10 instruments per song. Typical Monkees fans would be best advised to buy Rhino's \"Live 1967\" CD,which creates one ideal set from the three professionally recorded shows(all the shows had the same song line-ups).For those who do purchase this 4-CD set,you'll note that none of the selections in the 3 professionally recorded shows match exactly with the recordings as heard on \"Live 1967\".I suspect that on \"Live 1967\",that Rhino engineers(who had access to 3 renditions of each songs) spliced between renditions,used sampling,or (perhaps) had The Monkees come into the studio to overdub\/correct the recordings. What you'll get if you buy this set is the REAL(not particularly listenable!) ragged\/amateur\/garage band sound of The Monkees circa 1967,albeit lovingly packaged by Rhino Handmade. But \"Live 1967\" is much more listenable.","classification":2,"fold":6}

{"text":"I love just about everything Down, and having seen them live before, can honestly say that they are one of the few bands who manage to transfer the energy and power that populates their studio releases to the stage without fail.  \"Diary of a Mad band\" doesn't always display that however, as this set captures the band during their 2006 pre-\"Over the Under\" European tour.  The songs you'd expect to hear are here, such as \"Lifer\", \"Losing All\", \"Ghosts Along the Mississippi\", and \"Stone the Crow\", but the set list isn't the flaw here.  Vocalist Phil Anselmo's voice manages to go from booming one minute to sounding terrible the next.  It is obvious during some of Phil's on-stage ramblings that he's a little inebriated, and that all the years of booze, smokes, and drugs may have caught up with his voice.  It's sad really, considering that it was his work with Down that really showed-off how talented a singer Phil could be, but other than his failing voice, the band itself sounds great.  The included DVD features some cool footage of the band performing, as well as some brief snippets of them fooling around as well.  All in all, \"Diary of a Mad Band\" isn't a bad live album if you can get over what's happened to Phil's voice, and a worthwhile endeavor for die hard fans of the band.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Russell Suereth (pronounced sue - reth) is a composer\/ recording artist with a vision. In fact, many visions, which we'll soon see. As the title of his third and latest release implies, expressing and fostering universal spirituality is motivating force in his life and his music. The sounds heard on Spiritual Haven are rich in imagery, often of sacred places around the world, as well as those within us. Although he started out playing guitar at a young age, he later became interested in possibilities offered by keyboards, synthesizers, and samplers to add the sound and flavors of exotic instruments from diverse cultures as well as traditional Western orchestral instruments to his musical creations. This is something that Russell uses to full advantage to enhance the imagery that is so central to his compositions.\n\nThe album begins with \"A Magic Flight,\" which Russell envisions as a journey much like an enchanted flying carpet ride, with the listeners having a feeling of themselves and their spirit rising above the landscape. The music alternates between rhythmic passages, sometimes propelled by harp-like arpeggios or hand drums, and more mystical sounding interludes. This was something I found often in Russell's compositions as they flow and evolve through a variety of movements and musical modes. While many of the songs on the album are about external sacred places, some are about internal spaces. \"Glimmer of Light\" is one of these and reflects the idea of dealing with difficult life experiences and in turning to spirituality, one begins to see a solution or hope on the horizon. The music is rhythmic yet mellow, featuring the percussive sound of marimba, hand drums, and electronic beats, as well as layers of flute, strings, choir, ethereal female vocals, and more. Characteristic ingredients in the album overall are Russell's woodwind melodies and his unusual rhythmic patterns that sound Middle Eastern one moment and Pacific Rim-oriented the next.\n\nOne of my favorite tracks is \"Red Moon Calling,\" which opens with a yin-yang contrast of a spacey synthesizer sound juxtaposed with the earthy tones of a marimba. Another detail I appreciated on this song is Russell's use of electronic beats. While these can sometimes be relentless and overpowering in contemporary music, here they are implemented judiciously and spaciously, interlocking with other rhythmic elements to provide one of the coolest grooves on the album. Russell Suereth is a talented and evolving instrumentalist and composer. I particularly appreciate his flair for arranging in the way he weaves together the many and varied threads of his musical tapestries in interesting and often unexpected ways. But what stands out to me most about Russell is that he is a storyteller. Each song tells a tale that can evoke imagery in the mind's eye of the listener.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"A lot of great songs has a hook that captures your attention.  It could be a guitar lick, a certain lyric, or just the tune that is stuck in your head for a time.  What makes a song a truly great song is one that moves you every time you hear it.  Iris is one of those songs.  Lyrically, it's one of the better songs from the last twenty years.  The melody, along with John Rzeznik's gravely, almost desperate vocals, makes for a hauntingly beautiful song of forbidden love.  It's ironic that the song appeared in the 1998 film City of Angels with Nicolas Cage because he has always played the guy from the wrong side of the tracks whose characters would make any potential girlfriend's family nervous.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Then recently, I discovered this song in YouTube, the video of Steffie and Liam on the beach with this song playing in the background.\nThis is a totally beautiful recording about a woman who does not trust easily. Then she met a special man that she felt safe with and she sings You put your arms around me and I am home. How true this is in a happy relationship. This is a very romantic song and one I love to listen to often.\n\nHighly recommend this song!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I kinda feel bad for Kreashawn because the record bombed due to the label dropping the ball.  It only came out on CD a year too late and only in the US at Hot Topic stores, and NOBODY shops at Hot Topic for music!!  Otherwise, MP3 download or an import CD which doesn't count towards US sales.  This record was not in people's sight because of this...many didn't think she even had a record out!!  No BestBuy, Target, Walmart, indie stores, nothing, so no sales above 3900 copies????  Pathetic.\n\nIn spite of this, the record is a fun listen, good party music if you can take a filthy mouth...hell, under the CD tray is a pic of Kray flipping the bird!!  Funny to some, offensive to others...I thought it was cute.  The cover is a good indication of the music inside...cartoonish, colourful, and collegiate\/hipster.  It's like Nicki Minaj-esque bubblegum\/hiphop hybrid pop, partly rapped, partly sung, but merged with a smart-aleck college chick who thinks she's cooler than she really is, YET she is better than you would think.  Also, remember girl college rap\/female Beastie Boys Northern State??  Reminds me of them.\n\nShe talks a lot about drugs, violence, typical hiphop stuff, but with her own twist, and she's probably just bragging and is none of that stuff, so it's all just fantasy, and is probably boring & normal at home...not that that's bad, but people fantasize...and it doesn't hurt that the songs are really catchy, in the vein of Nicki.  And still, the 2011 viral hit \"Gucci Gucci\" is still fun, and somehow the volume level is higher on that song than the rest of the album, weird.  Other fun tunes are the new single \"Go Hard (La La La)\", \"Luv Haus\" is a catchy tune as well, why people hate on that is strange...I dig it...opener \"Blase Blase\" is fun and has a unique musical bed.  She can hold her own with guests like 2 Chainz and Kid Cudi as well.\n\nBut I like the record, it deserved better...and is better than the haters are making it out to be...if you like Nicki, remember Northern State, or love good catchy party girlpop with a dirty mouth, give it a try if you find a Hot Topic store near you...or download it...have low expectations, then you may be surprised by Kreashawn's debut.  Just sayin'...","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"\"This is gonna hurt\" is the second, brand new album by \"Sixx A.M.\", the band of \"Motley Crue\" mastermind and bassist Nikki Sixx. Much like its predecessor \"The heroin diaries\", the new album is based on the auto-biographical book of the same name.\n\nOn this second studio effort Nikki reunites with lead guitarist James Michael and lead singer DJ Ashba who also handles keyboards, drums and programming.  With a stable line up you can rightfully expect the same musical recipe of the debut. For that matter you get a rather modern version of Sleaze metal emphasizing instrumental melodies and vocal harmonies with intriguing arrangements, often adding orchestral parts, acoustic backing instruments and piano. Above all, the end result is incredibly catchy, offering some of the most memorable hooks. Favourite tracks include \"Help is on the way\", \"This is gonna hurt\", \"Lies of the beautiful people\", \"Live forever\" and \"Goodbye my dear friends\".\n\nIndeed \"This is gonna hurt\" is another well arranged offering from Sixx's band that definitely stands on its own regardless of whether the listener has actually read the book counterpart. Each song has such a developed musical personality standing differentiated from the rest and it is this quality that makes the album an enjoyably listen from start to finish; perhaps making one wish that the band included more songs on it. \"This is gonna hurt\" is a must for any fan of Sleaze metal, \"Motley Crue\", \"Bad City\" or \"Black veil Brides\".","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"This RCA Legacy edition of the classic 1971 album features nine bonus tracks (including a radio promotional ad) and a DVD featuring eleven live performances. If you did not already purchase last year's Sanctuary Records deluxe edition (a pricey import), this domestic release is a welcome alternative.\n\nLet's give this album some historical perspective. The previous year, the Kinks had their first Top 10 single (\"Lola\") and their first Top 40 album (LOLA VS. POWERMAN AND THE MONEYGOROUND) since 1964. If the record company was hoping to cash in on that success with their next album, they didn't know Ray Davies very well. MUSWELL HILLBILLIES stalled at No. 100 and the single \"20th Century Man\" couldn't even break the Hot 100. But as far back as 1967 with SOMETHING ELSE and its follow-up THE VILLAGE GREEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY, Ray Davies seemed to be more concerned about releasing albums and less concerned about producing a hit.\n\nFor me, MUSWELL HILLBILLIES is one of the Kinks' greatest albums (certainly their best album of the seventies). In many ways, this album revisited many of the themes from VILLAGE GREEN--a nostalgic look at a simpler time (\"Have a Cuppa Tea\"), bemoaning the post-war changes (\"Muswell Hillbilly\") and fear of the future (\"Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues\"). Note Ray's repeated line from \"20th Century Man\":  \"I'm a twentieth century man, but I don't wanna be here.\" And, yes, Ray can be pessimistic. Here's the couplet that opens and closes \"Oklahoma, U.S.A\":  \"All life we work, but work is a bore\/If life's for livin', what's livin' for?\" Maybe it's not so much depression as it is discontent. (I like to think it's the latter.)  And stylistically, the album is all over the map--blues, country, music hall. But it all works. This is a very satisfying collection of songs.\n\nAll of the bonus tracks were recorded at the same time (September\/October 1971) and the same place (Morgan Studios) as the rest of the album, presumably in contention for inclusion but for whatever reason were left off. \"Lavender Lane\" is another Ray Davies' composition that bemoans the consequences of progress:  \"Oh Lord, such a pity that the world's gotta change.\" [Note: Like \"Muswell Hillbilly,\" the lyrics of both songs reference Rosie Rooke.] \"Mountain Woman\" and \"Kentucky Moon\" first showed up on the 1998 Velvel re-issue. All three of these tracks would have fit thematically, but with a running time approaching forty-five minutes on the original album there simply wasn't space. The only other \"new\" songs are a demo of \"Nobody's Fool\" and a backing track of \"Queenie.\" You also get an alternate instrumental take of \"20th Century Man\" and alternate versions \"Have a Cuppa Tea\" (which pushes Dave Davies guitar to the front with a more country sound) and somewhat slower \"Uncle Son.\" Closing out the CD is a 50-second radio spot promoting the new album.\n\nThe DVD presents the Kinks live. The first two tracks are from a Jan. 4, 1972 performance first aired on BBC2 TV's \"The Old Grey Whistle Test.\" The next nine songs were filmed at the Rainbow Theater in London, Jan. 31, 1972, and rebroadcast on BBC1 TV the following July as \"The Kinks at the Rainbow.\" The songs are interspersed with interviews from band members to Arthur Howes (the Kinks' first agent) to the guy in the red sweater on the album cover. The only issues I have with the DVD is that only four of the eleven tracks are from MUSWELL HILLBILLIES (and TWO of them are \"Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues) and Ray dominates the screen--very little face time for Dave (even during solos).\n\nKnowing how quickly a lot of the Kinks' re-issues have gone out of print, I'd grab a copy of this now. It's a very reasonable price compared to the import deluxe editions, and I can't think of a better way to celebrate the Kinks' 50th anniversary.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  [Running time - CD, 44:46; DVD, 44:46]","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Right off the bat I'll say that there is absolutely nothing deep or profound about Lady Gaga or her music. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. In fact her album The Fame is one of the funnest albums I've heard recently and a great CD to sing along to in the car or dance around to in your living room. Poker Face just happens to be one of the stronger, catchier tunes from the album, in my opinion, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was released as a maxi-single with remixes.\n\nNone of the remixes significantly stray too far from the original, which depending on your taste in remixes could be a good or a bad thing. Yet they still manage to be distinctive enough from eachother to make this single worthwhile. The Space Cowboy mix is probably the most electronically-infused and \"experimental\" version of the bunch, while the Jody Den Broeder and Dave Aude remixes are your more traditional club fare. And as an extra bonus the original version is included with the instrumental, which is interesting to hear with the vocals removed.\n\nLike I implied before, this surely won't go down in history as one of the great timeless classics. But Lady Gaga has wicked style and an okay voice and long after the popularity of Poker Face fades from view, which it will, I'll still be glad to own it.","classification":4,"fold":6}

The Beatles have been the one constant that everyone has listened to for generations, and the dynamics of their songs have definitely never gone out of style. Their classic albums have finally reached a whole new generation of fans, since the Fab Four's music finally has been released for the first time as digital downloads, and the time has been well worth the wait and the songs as well. Let It Be has to be one of the most definitive songs of their catalogs. Paul McCartney's voice and the simplicity of the song have made it a deeper benchmark, than any of the songs they have recorded before like I Am The Walrus, Sgt.

{"text":"I enjoyed watching Monica's reality show - especially the scenes in the studio & her meeting with the label regarding which single would lead this project.  Monica has been one of my favorite young divas since she debuted @ the age of 14 - she has always been herself and hasn't changed into some type of industry puppet to suit the new millenium record label bosses.\n\nI admit to having been underwhelmed by her last release - although the ballads were great & she sounded great, that project felt and still feels very disjointed to me.  I know that Monica is still a young woman and although it's too early to put her in the adult contemporary category, stronger songwriting is needed for uptempo tracks to really showcase her vocally.  This collection is ballad heavy but I think these songs perfectly show off her beautiful voice.\n\nThe album gets off to a great start with the autobiographical STILL STANDING f\/ Ludacris - being familiar with the track as the theme for her show, this was an excellent 1st single.  The lyrics take listeners on a journey of Monica's life both in & out of the business and is an excellent way for her to reintroduce herself to old and new fans.\n\nThe next track, ONE IN A LIFETIME is the only track that I still really don't like.  It's a little to overproduced and as many times as I've listened to it, I just don't like this track.\n\nSTAY OR GO is a track that I kinda like - it features really honest lyrics set to a very restrained stripped down musical arrangement.\n\nEVERYTHING TO ME - strong lead single!  What more could you ask for? - Monica's powerful vocals, the beautiful lyrics & a popular sample of a Deniece Williams hit...perfection.\n\nIF YOU WERE MY MAN - another smart sample use of Evelyn \"Champagne\" King's \"Betch She Don't Love You\".  Although I could do without the Missy Elliot shout-outs, this is a fun track to listen to if only for the sampled beats.\n\nMIRROR - features the \"synthy\" sound that so many artists are incorporating now but this track is just ok for me.  The lyrics are strong but it's not one of my favorites.\n\nHERE I AM - another great ballad\n\nSUPERMAN - wow!\n\nLOVE ALL OVER ME - double wow!!  Excellent 2nd single choice.  And on a personal note, I don't know why I was shocked to see Jermaine Dupri listed as one of the songwriters given the fact that he has surprised me previously as one of the songwriters for a few Mariah Carey songs that have become my favorites.  This song is absolutely beautiful every time I hear it or the video comes on I find myself stopping what I'm doing to just enjoy the song.\n\nBELIEVING IN ME - another vocal knockout!  Another song with great, heartfelt lyrics and Monica singing her heart out.\n\nCongrats to team Monica for putting her back in the forefront of r&b female singers and although we can foretell that Alicia Keys will clean up at the Grammies, I certainly hope that this album is recognized as one of the best most cohesive r&b albums of this year.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"In 1963, Miles Davis took his new quintet-- tenor saxophonist George Coleman, pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter and drummer Tony Williams on the road.  No less than three live albums-- \"Miles Davis in Europe\", \"My Funny Valentine\", and \"Four and More\" were drawn from these shows.  \"Miles Davis in Europe\" is the weakest of these.\n\nThe set consists of a handful of originals and standards Davis had been associated with for several years and Victor Feldman's \"Joshua\", recorded in this studio the previous month.  The performances are decent enough, but it seems to lack something.  Part of the problem is that Davis is at times detached-- his performance on \"Autumn Leaves\" for example finds him pretty really not digging in at all (curiously enough, Coleman digs deep and produces a real gem of a performance).  Much of the rest of the set shows that this was a very new band-- \"Milestones\" and \"Joshua\" both find Davis running full bore and soloing explosively (particularly the latter, where Tony Williams pushes him on and on), but when Davis' solo ends and Coleman takes over, the intensity drops way down, particularly on \"Milestones\" where Coleman seems to run out of steam.\n\nFor all these gripes, there are still quite a bit of brilliant performances-- \"Walkin'\" is probably worth the price of the disc alone-- Davis comes skidding in and whirls through his solo before turning over to Coleman, whose angular solo is unceasingly inventive.  And Davis really digs in deep on \"I Thought About You\", opening in a ballad form and really cutting loose into a deep blues feel.\n\nStill, all in all, there are other recordings by this band that are significantly better-- start with the studio effort or the other two live albums (recorded some time later), come back to this one if you need more.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"The only complaint about \"Have a Holly Jolly Christmas\" is that Burl Ives sings only a dozen songs on it and you can find CD collections that will offer more tracks culled from his various Christmas albums.  His first, \"Christmas Day in the Morning,\" came out in 1952, followed by \"Christmas Eve\" in 1956.  \"Have a Holly Jolly Christmas\" came out in 1965, with the soundtrack to the classic holiday television special \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" the following year.  The title song of this album was written by for the special by Johnny Marks, who also wrote the song \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" which Ives sings on this album, and the final track, \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.\"  That is a pretty good trio of Christmas songs, which would make Marks one of the best writers of Christmas songs ever.\n\nHow this album is different from the previous Burl Ives Christmas albums is that he has shifted to this point to more of a pop-oriented approach to singing Christmas songs that the traditional folk style that defined his earlier albums.  There are still some folk songs on this album, with \"Christmas is a Birthday,\" \"Christmas Child (Loo, Loo, Loo),\" \"Christmas Can't Be Far Away,\" and \"Snow for Johnny.\"  But most of the songs are definitely more popular than secular, with \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town,\" \"White Christmas,\" \"Winter Wonderland,\" and \"Silver Bells.\"  I tend to think of \"The Little Drummer Boy\" as being more religious than it really us, but that is more because the music is more hymn-like.\n\nThe net result is that you have Burl Ives singing eight recognizable Christmas songs and introducing you to four songs that you have probably not heard before that are perfectly suited to his strengths as a singer.  Ives started out in the 1920s as an itinerate folk singers, moved to Broadway in the 1930s, appeared on the radio in the 1940s, and became a popular folk singer in the 1950s.  But most people today probably remember him as the Snowman who narrates the story of \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" that still airs each holiday season forty years later.  Because of that connection it is entirely possible that a Burl Ives Christmas album will be warmly received in your home by those who do not know about the rest of his resume.  He certainly produces the requisite warm seasonal feelings.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"The intro definitely has middle-eastern influence, some parts are probably how you might have heard them if you were in the holy land a couple thousand years ago.  I think that this treatment gives the song its unique appeal.  If you don't like the sound of middle-eastern chant, you might want to stay away. I don't think an Arabic influence was the intent, but rather, Jerusalem. (I could be wrong, but that is what I hear.)\n\nThe song does also have standard voicing that is clearly just contemporary, but it is intermingled with middle-eastern chords and sounds.  I enjoyed its uniqueness and I think it would have been interesting to hear a version that was completely middle-eastern-ized.\n\nIf you like world music and esp. middle-eastern or a fusion thereof, do download this and listen to it.","classification":5,"fold":6}
{"text":"On their 9th release (and the first in six years), these legendary Boise, Idaho veterans play incredibly satisfying and addictive indie rock songs that juxtapose a polished melodic intent with brilliantly played, ripping guitar notes and subtle hints of classic psychedelic rock.  Built To Spill is an institution:  They rock hard with class.  They sing with harmony & conviction.  They write great songs with a distinctive character and play them with a passionate professionalism that feels naturally loose & easy.  And they seem to continue getting better and better.  Every time I listen to a Built To Spill album, I feel goodlike Ive both spent my time wisely and enjoyed it.  This is a band at the top of their game, and Untethered Moon is an album thats just imminently listenable.  Recalls a bunch of great bands:  Yo La Tengo, Polvo, Sweet Apple, Dinosaur Jr., Eleventh Dream Day, Caustic Resin, Spoon, Seam, Silversun Pickups, Neutral Milk Hotel, even Pink Floyd at times.  In the indie rock world, it just doesnt get any better.  Just stunning, really.  Highest Recommendation!","classification":5,"fold":6}

Beautiful music in beautiful packaging, for all the whiners and complainers all I can say....BOO! to you. Here's the rundown (from dead.net)......\n\nThe fourth and final DAVE'S PICKS release of 2014 heeds the long awaited call for one of the best shows of the coveted year of 1977. A top candidate for release for many years, GRATEFUL DEAD archivist extraordinaire Dick Latvala wrote of 11\/4\/77, \"this show must have destroyed everyone's mind, with the unique material (\"Dupree's Diamond Blues\" & \"Aiko Aiko\") and great performance. One can easily tell that this was a special occasion by the way Lesh carries on at the beginning of the 2nd set.\" His praise of the show, replete with plenty of \"we should definitely mention\" notes, continued from the day he received the tape all the way through the '90s, so you know this one stands the test time. We're sure you'll agree after just a few listens to an inspired \"Let It Grow,\" an intense \"Other One,\" an other-worldly take on \"Stella Blue,\" and much, much more. And if that (for some strange reason) isn't enticing enough, we've rounded out the 3-CD set with over 75+ minutes of super hot material from Seneca College Field House, Toronto, 11\/2\/77......\n\nDISC #1\nRecorded at the Wesley M.

{"text":"With the surprise double-platinum success of 2001's Acoustic Soul, India. Arie became that rare bird -- particularly in contemporary R&B -- who straddles the line between artistic innovation and schmaltz. Certainly a talented guitar-playing songstress, she also takes her lyrical cues from Hallmark cards, a mix at once comfortable and off-putting -- and difficult to put one's finger on.\nThis follow-up, seemingly rushed into stores, doesn't clear up the confusion; as with Alicia Keys, it's almost impossible to criticize a contemporary urban artist who writes life-affirming, organic songs, yet this journey ends as unconvincingly as Soul or Songs in A Minor. What's more, it lacks any sort of knockout number -- Soul had two, \"Video\" and \"Brown Skin\" -- leaving us to wonder just where Arie intended on taking us.\nWhich is not to say that the potential isn't there, only that balance is not. Is she the younger visage of Tracy Chapman (\"The One,\" \"Power of Words\")? Channeling Chaka Khan on two gleefully old school steppin' tracks, \"Interested\" and \"Slow Down\"? When she takes her own advice to \"live for the moment,\" she gets better results: \"Get it Together\" is a swirling slam-dunk of a love song, and \"Good Man,\" an overlooked track off the We Were Soldiers soundtrack, makes a nice fit here. When she comes off preachy, it's with treacly results: \"God is Real\" and \"Little Things\" are cloying bits of armchair philosophy.\nVoyage is at its most interesting, and often its best, when Arie tries to come from out of the shadows of her influences and chart her own path. Though she stumbles on \"The Truth\" trying to incorporate slicker R&B-style beats into the mix, the titular Spanish folk tinges of \"Headed in the Right Direction\" says it all, as does \"India's Song,\" which could have been the album's most overwrought track but instead perfectly mixes Chapman's subdued introspection with Woody Guthrie's wide-eyed folk. These are the tracks suggest the voyage isn't over; it may have only just begun.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"It could be that the band wanted to show-off their resilient new lineup (co-founder Sonny Mayo exited the fold in 2008 and was replaced by Clint Lowery), or it could be just that they wanted to have a new batch of songs to take with them on tour. But for whatever the reason, Georgias own Sevendust found it necessary to enter their twelfth year of existence by immediately follow up 2007s Alpha with another new album the next year. But even though their seventh full-length effort from the studio, Chapter VII: Hope And Sorrow, cannot exactly claim to be a watershed release, it is home to all of the 7D ingredients that you know and should already love by now. Hence, expect to hear plenty of infectious vocal hooks soaring over syncopated drumming and bottom-heavy riffs, here, as well as an equal number of clouds-parting choruses that practically scream modern rock radio.\n\nAnd besides, there are a few spots of if not innovation, then at least mild experimentation to be had from time to time. Inside, for example, finds Sevendust exploring some moderately new ground, as it opens with a really ominous and foreboding, industrial-lite intro with creepy synth accents; and track number nine, Sorrow, also opens with an undeniable nod to the industrial metal genre, with moody, techno-industrial-like knick-knacks and well-placed synth flourishes. And moreover, we also get a cool, tranquil piano in the intro of Hope; and two actual, honest-to-goodness guitar solos in Scapegoat and Fear. (The former might be a really mediocre solo, but it is a solo nonetheless; and the latter is a surprisingly ripping, wah-wah-heavy solo.)\n\nFor the most part, though, C VII: H&S is just another day in the office of Sevendust. Even those experimental moments noted above are surrounded in prototypical 7D goodness, because by the time the first two of those tracks has hit their respective choruses, they have each become funky, and really chunky and bottom-heavy big-riff rockers with solid guitar leads and strong, stop-start rhythm sections. And its vocals, meanwhile, alternate between guttural growling in the verses and accomplished clean singing in the infectious, majestically melodic choruses.\n\nElsewhere, Enough might have some questionable lyrics, sure (i.e. Too much is never enough), but it nevertheless makes for a really fun listen, as it is a slammin ode to the mosh pit with really meaty, chunky, fiery guitar licks and machine gun drumming. And the aforementioned Scapegoat is also a noteworthy standout for storming onto the scene with almost crushing force, backing huge, densely crunching guitar chords and pounding, lumbering rhythms with deftly hefty, churning double bass drums.\n\nIn addition to featuring the already described guitar solo, Fear is another big standout on account of it bringing back plenty of Lejons soulful and heartfelt, clean vocal hooks, and pinning them against crunchy, driving guitar chunk. The Past is a good, acoustic-based, and very soaring power ballad with excellent, memorable twin-headed vocal harmonies; but it is immediately followed-up by a commandingly heavy and dense bruiser in Prodigal Son.\n\nOn the downside, a track like Lifeless kind of misses the mark. Why? Because aside from featuring a chilling and haunting intro, the track brings absolutely nothing new to the table. But thats nitpicking I suppose, because there are no stinkers to be found here. And besides, it is almost immediately followed-up by Contradiction, an excellent mosh pit anthem with blood-pumping tempos, brutal guitar\/drum give-and-take, and booming rhythms. A frenetic sense of energy also courses throughout, here, as does plenty of angry, visceral, gang-shout-like vocals. And finally, the set concludes with Walk Away, which is a catchy mix of dueling, back-and-forth vocals offset by sweeping melodies and amazing clean singing.\n\nNaturally, some listeners will hear the chugging guitars and soulful melodic choruses of a song like Lifeless, and immediately turn the album off, automatically dismissing the rest of it as merely formulaic fare. But thats their loss. This is a darn solid album from Sevendust, an exceptional band. So, if you were not a fan of this band before, you probably wouldnt even be reading this in the first place; and if you were a fan, then there is absolutely no reason to stop being one now. Be on the look out for guest appearances from Chris Daughtry, Creeds Mark Tremonti, and members of Alter Bridge.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Welcome to our newest Big Bach Set - this box is our second release dedicated to the music of Franz Joseph Haydn. We released a Haydn Symphonies box in 2012, and now we have our official \"Big Haydn Box.\" There's still plenty of symphonies - 14 of them - but also a fine selection of Haydn's choral works, chamber music and orchestral music that helped establish the Bach Guild and Vanguard's classical catalogs as one of the world's leaders in recording baroque and classical music.\nAs always, we try to create these boxes with an ear toward all possible music lovers. This set is easy to define however - it essentially contains, when combined with the Haydn Symphonies box set, every note of Haydn recorded by Seymour Solomon and company from 1950 to 1980. We've left a few movements out for use in later collections - but these are arrangements of works best suited for a collection of music meant for background listening.\n\nWe usually touch a bit on the history of The Bach Guild in these reviews. The Bach Guild's devotion to Haydn seems to revolve entirely around the participation and relationship between Seymour Solomon and renowned musical scholar H.C. Robbins Landon, at that time a young man leading a generation toward new thinking about Franz Joseph Haydn. While the Bach cantatas were the calling cards in the early days, under the vision of Landon and Solomon, The Bach Guild created the world premiere recording of the Lord Nelson Mass and the Mass in Time of War, as well as the premiere of Landon's own revised scores for Haydn's final six symphonies (all of which are included in this set). Landon also penned the liner notes for almost all of the Haydn recordings made by The Bach Guild in the 1950s.\n\nBefore we get to our description of what's in the Big Haydn Box, we want to thank everyone who takes the time to leave comments here on Amazon and on our web site and Facebook page. We read them all - and as you will see, we do our best to incorporate the requests into our future endeavors.\n\n1. We have scrupulously attempted to avoid repeating any repertoire from earlier boxes, and on the Haydn Box we have mainly succeeded. The only repeats are the Mogens Woldike performances of Symphonies 101 and 102, approximately 40 minutes in a box that runs for 14 hours.\n\n2. We are always thrilled to find so many lovers of the old Vanguard recordings on these comment pages, so we're taking the time to mention two recordings that won't be here. A recording of the \"Echo\" divertimento and the oboe concerto that were made in the mid 1950s by the Bach Guild were not included because scholarship has determined that these works are probably not written by Haydn.\n\n3. LONG, LONG track titles - we noticed this from our Vivaldi and Bigger Bach Set comments here and on Reddit - that files that have very long \"metadata\", or track descriptions, often run afoul of Windows 7 users. We are stuck between a rock and hard place on this one - we try to be exhaustive for those music lovers who appreciate detail, but we are running up against technology - and some of these tracks - notably the Divertimentos for flute and strings - have incredibly long titles because these works are arrangements of other works. So - we have shortened the titles for this release, and we are included the entire names on our web site if you want to adjust these titles on your own.\n\n4. As for the usual goodies that we like to provide - that is, hard to find recordings of special interest - we don't have that many \"never before released\" recordings, but we do have some titles who have been out of print on many formats for a while. \"The Creation\" has been unavailable in any format since the late 1990s. Same for Woldike's performances of Symphonies 99-104, although we did use two symphonies in our Haydn symphonies box. The harpsichord concertos (both), the guitar quintet and the divertimenti for flute and strings are all receiving their debuts on any format since LP. Lili Kraus' recording of the Haydn Fantasy has been out of print since the 1980s and it is also included here.\n\n5. And for those who read these comments closely, you know that this writer believes that the David Blum recordings of Haydn symphonies made with the New York-based Esterhazy Orchestra are perhaps the finest hard to find \"goodies\" in the entire Bach Guild catalog. Forgive a story - these recordings were meant to be included in last year's Haydn Symphonies box but at the last minute, a mastering flaw was discovered in the second movement of Symphony No. 75. Since that recording was on the same master as the Symphony No. 59, both recordings were removed at the last moment. When the conductor's wife was informed that the Haydn Symphonies playlist had reached #1 on Amazon's Overall MP3 Chart, the conductor's wife was not glad but in fact, incensed that the playlist had not included Blum's performance of Symphony No. 59, which she described as \"indicative as the nickname - a truly fiery performance indeed\". She was right - but we didn't get around to releasing more Haydn until now. So here it is - and the performance is every bit as extraordinary as Mrs. Blum says it is. This is the final recording with the Esterhazy Orchestra that has remained unreleased. A few listeners in the know about these performances have expressed their happiness about the resulting release. We agree - when side by side with other, more well-known performances, these exciting renditions hold up against any interpretation.\n\nAgain, a note of thanks to everyone - and we hope you were able to take advantage of Amazon's incredible sale on of our Big Bach Sets. We don't know when there will be another - but we have quite a few new lines coming.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Chris Knight has never been a man who's done much talkin', and to that end, on this his first release in nearly four years, he continues to let his music do the talking.  Good alternative country music is as much about a believable attitude as it is the heartfelt notes, and if it doesn't cause a buzzing in your ears, and an itching at the bottoms of your pockets, then it ain't the real deal.  Little Victories is nearly prophetic, it's filled with enigmatic truths, rural sensibilities, and visionary road weary enlightenments ... picking up right where Springsteen left off on Nebraska.  Though it wouldn't take much to convince me that perhaps Bruce was channeling something he hadn't actually heard yet, because there's no way music with this much power and dirt road honestly can conform to the physical laws or space and time.\n\nKnight's perfected his own organic approach to music, following in the footsteps of his legends, John Prine, Lucinal Williams, and Steve Earle, recording this outing, except for a couple of overdubs, completely live ... and to my way of thinking, laying it all on the line is the only way to capture an honest spirit, and breath life into a series of chords laced together by lyrics that conjure hidden magic.  Little Victories isn't about the usual country fluff, Little Victories is both a step back and a step forward, delivering urgent social commentary through songs with stance and character.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Cyndi Lauper is one of those eighties singers whose talent was modest but personality was overwhelming. It was what made \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/She-s-So-Unusual\/dp\/B000051Y0G\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">She's So Unusual<\/a>\" so brilliant; Cyndi was so totally outside the mold that everything on it quaked with the stellar portrayal of the artist as a young woman. From the classic anthem \"Girls Just Wanna have Fun\" to the emotional bulls-eye of \"Time After Time,\" Cyndi and all her friends established the pattern that would follow for the rest of her career. Cyndi found songs to match her one-of-a-kind voice and would deliver them with style.\n\nThat she had a knack for plucking gems from obscurity also helped. The Brains' apocryphal \"Money Changes Everything\" is one such example, ditto for \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/True-Colors\/dp\/B00000266K\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">True Colors<\/a>'s\" rocking \"Change of Heart.\" She was such a colorful fusion of styles and personality that the singles on this \"Essential\" collection still often sound buoyant and alive even now. It was around the time of \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/A-Night-to-Remember\/dp\/B0000026KU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">A Night to Remember<\/a>\" and \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Hatful-Of-Stars\/dp\/B00005G3WY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hatful Of Stars<\/a>\" that Cyndi's efforts to sound serious got the better of her. On \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Twelve-Deadly-Cyns-and-Then-Some\/dp\/B000002AM9\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Twelve Deadly Cyns and Then Some<\/a>,\" Cyndi wisely chose to include \"Sally's Pigeons\" (co-written with Mary Chapin Carpenter, of all people), where the emotional heft matched the ambition, where the title track here didn't.\n\nThat ambition also lead to Cyndi's activism. \"True Colors\" has become something of a gay anthem, a call to recognize yourself as the person you are. It became the Nom De'Tour of Cyndi's summer 2007 tour for the Human Rights Campaign (along with Debbie Harry and Erasure, among others), and her tireless work on behalf of the Matthew Sheppard Foundation and other causes. Her timeless music couples with her work for the future.\n\nHer attempt to broaden the style works OK on \"Sisters of Avalon\" and \"Unhook The Stars,\" but I would have happily traded them (or \"When You Were Mine\") in for \"What's Going On.\" All is forgiven however, by finally finding \"The Goonies R Good Enough\" on a proper US Cyndi Lauper CD. A quickie knock-off to a Steven Spielberg screaming kids movie, it is all the things great about Cyndi's hits; melodic, energetic and sing-along-quirky. It makes \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Essential-Cyndi-Lauper\/dp\/B00008PX8X\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Essential Cyndi Lauper<\/a>\" the best single disc collection of Cyndi you can get without shelling out for pricey double-disc imports.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"There are just very few artists that are out there right now, that have had massive success from the 80's that those songs still stand strong today. We have lost a lot of those artists from drugs, alcohol, and self-doubt on whether they can be who they are today, as they did back then. This past year, we lost Prince, Pete Burns of Dead Or Alive and David Bowie to just name a few. But of all of the acts that have passed away, there has been some that really have came back strong personally and professionally. Phil Collins has made the ambitious decision about coming out of retirement, and coming back musically, and personally, and the decision has been both brilliant and personal. He re-released his entire catalog and his work has definitely sounded better than ever. But back in 1985, he was someone that took on a lot of heat when he sampled Prince's 1999  with his massive hit, Sussudio. But the song today sounds just as strong and vibrant, as it did back then. The song still makes me want to just get up, sing and dance. It is one of those fee-good anthems that really is worth the soul.

{"text":"First, I want to say The Bee Gees are part of my musical DNA. I grew up on them, defended them, always saw their talent above all else, was extremely happy to see them inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and terribly saddened along the way as Andy Gibb and Maurice Gibb died, and in May 2012, Robin, too. I can't imagine what it's like to be the eldest brother (Barry) and have lost all your brothers.\n\nI also want to say that as a kid, I was never aware of Robin's solo works. It wouldn't be until 1990's box set \"Tales From The Brothers Gibb\" that I became aware that both Robin and Barry released solo works in the 1980's. Still, finding Robin's solo works on cd over the years has been cost prohibitive and challenging. Even now, I see I can download his first three albums for a decent price, but his last two albums are nowhere to be found, unless you buy \"Magnet\" as an import cd, and unless you want to pay out the nose for \"Walls Have Eyes\".\n\nWith that in mind, I have never listened to a solo Robin Gibb album until now. While I appreciate the efforts of his family, at 17 tracks, my warning light went off. Unless all 17 tracks are superb there is going to be a lot of filler, and that, unfortunately, tends to be the case with \"50 St. Catherine's Drive\".\n\nTo me, the best tracks here are: \"Days Of Wine And Roses\", \"Alan Freeman Days\", \"Avalanche\", \"One Way Love\", \"Broken Wings\", \"Sanctuary\", \"Solid\" and \"All We Have Is Now\", plus the demo of \"Sydney\" was decent as well. As much as I miss his voice, each brother, alone, is not equal to the whole collective, The Bee Gees. I always thought Andy Gibb should have been a part of The Bee Gees, by the way.\n\nSo, yes, I need to buy up Robin's solo works and put \"50 St. Catherine's Drive\" in perspective, but for now, three stars--good, but not exactly memorable or classic.\n\n1970 Robin's Reign\n1983 How Old Are You?\n1984 Secret Agent\n1985 Walls Have Eyes\n2003 Magnet\n2014 50 St. Catherine's Drive","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"Poor Cyndi, she'll always be remembered for that song where girls want to have fun, and she didn't even write it. Sad? Not really, she still rakes in the big bucks. But this little song was her crowning jewel, and showed that she just might be a real artist after all... those thoughts quickly faded though. And even though that song is considered underrated, it's been covered this way and that way, from Spoken to Rob Thomas, to a plethora of other artists. However, while all great, none of them take it to this level. Nope, Quietdrive hit gold here. What sad is the fact that this is their biggest song, and they didn't even write it. Ironic, no?\n\nThe first thing that grabs me is the modern feel they add to the song, more pop\/punk ballad, just more updatedness. Then the lyrics will grab you, with those appropriate vocals that don't over do it, but don't under do it either. It's just perfect here. Then the chorus really takes off into a total emotional experience, making the song the band's own, and taking it to new heights.\n\nThe picture I get in my mind when I think of this song, is two lovers holding hands, trying to hang on while on a spinning carousel. Pretty cool image, but that's what this song conveys. The joy and wonderfulness of love a such a great emotional level.\n\nThen the part right after the 2nd chorus just comes to an emotional climax, and if that couldn't get any better, it unleashes it all in the 3rd round of choruses. Pretty awesome and well-done to say the least. Although it probably ends too fast. They could have gone about 30-seconds longer.\n\nSo overall, Quietdrive really puts their heart into this underrated pop\/punk ballad that works in amazing ways to say the least. I just loved hearing it on its few short months on radio. And I'll probably never forget it. It's a wonderful song, and if you loved the original, you should probably check this out.","classification":5,"fold":6}

We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity.

{"text":"Willie Nelson's colorful album The Great Divide (2002) is a mostly collaborative effort where Willie sings duets with the likes of Sheryl Crow, Kid Rock, Brian McKnight, Rob Thomas, and others. Actually, the best songs are the ones Willie does solo. The theme here seems to be centered around the challenges of getting older, and surviving the changes life brings us as we age. In the song This Face, Willie sings:\n\nAnd this old heart's been beaten up\nAnd my ragged soul's had things rough\nAnd this face is all I have\n...worn and lived in\n\nThe Great Divide is ambitiously produced (that's a good thing here) with lots of varied instrumentation and musical textures, and it sounds kind of like a pop album with a touch of country. The Willie solo songs Won't Catch Me Crying, The Great Divide, and This Face are all deep, thoughtful and quietly contemplative, and the music fits them perfectly. The best of the duets continue this mood, and they include the somber You Remain (w\/ Bonnie Raitt), the Bernie Taupin penned Mendocino County Line (w\/ Lee Ann Womack), and the very, very enjoyable Don't Fade Away (w\/ Brian McKnight), which is an inspiration to anyone carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders:\n\nDon't fade away\nNothing is what it seems\nYou're lost and in between\nBut you'll find yourself again\n\nThese songs are all very good in a world-weary, but resilient and hopeful way. Be There For You (w\/ Sheryl Crow) and Maria (Shut Up And Kiss Me; w\/ Rob Thomas) are pretty good, too, but Last Stand In Open Country (w\/ Kid Rock) is a good song that could have been better if Willie would have found someone else to sing it with. Nothing against Kid Rock, but as a singer he's a little out of his league here. Willie also does a great solo cover of Cyndi Lauper's Time After Time that works very well. Recollection Phoenix (written by Rob Thomas) is also a very good and thoughtful song that Willie does solo.\n\nThe Great Divide isn't really a classic, but it's a very good country\/pop music album that has some great songs on it, especially if you're a survivor and in the mood for reflective and autumnal themes, and hearing Willie get a little help from his friends.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"There is no question that so many of today's divas are really more like trashy pop tarts, than really showing what the voice is suppose to be from the inside. But honestly, so many of those simply legendary divas have either retired, stopped making music, or just passed away. That has been the case with so many pop divas from Whitney Houston, or Tammy Wynette. And there have been some divas that have never gotten the credit they rightfully deserve. Phyllis Hyman was one of those divas. Hard to believe that it has been over twenty years since she tragically committed suicide and just left behind a mark that was never given the commercial success that acts like Patti LaBelle or Aretha Franklin have garnished. When I think of what Phyllis had as a singer, I think of so many of her brilliant songs, and Living All Alone is one of them. It is just a soaring ballad that speaks so well from the soul that is haunting and beautiful. Phyllis had sung so soulfully, that she really could have been able to move mountains, but no river was cast over stone for the populace. I would say many of today's divas that have no voice or soul whatsoever like Beyonce' Knowles, Rihanna or Ariana Grande could learn a thing from what Phyllis had recorded over the years. This is a great song, and a beautiful download for new and die hard fans of the great Phyllis Hyman.\n\nSong: A 1\/2-","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"The downward spiral away from music with any semblance of song structure continues. The God of Anger Pop, who once created the singularly perfect musical moment that was Pretty Hate Machine, must have reached his seventh day of creation: for he is clearly resting on Ghosts. This is Reznor on a lazy day, bored with nothing better to do.\n\nGhosts I-IV is an organized chaos of happy (and angry and sad) accidents. I imagine a herd (or pod?) of Macs and samplers, pots and pans; left to their own devices, could produce something akin to Ghosts if they tried real hard. And I suspect Trent made exactly what he intended to make.\n\nI admit that I'm still a pathetic hold-out waiting for Pretty Hate Machine II - The Revenge. Thus, nothing less will ever truly satisfy. Ghosts is neither fixed nor broken. It's really not that bad, but it's just not that good. And for a small fistful of dollars, I shouldn't complain.\n\nI certainly like the progressive and revolutionary distribution (a la Radiohead's Rainbows) where the evil middle-man record company is kept out of the artist's and fans' relationship. I have to give kudos to NIN for fighting the good fight. So at worst, Ghosts I-IV will take up some precious space on your iPod. At best, it's harmless background noise. NIN Ghosts is a little haunting but definitely not scary.","classification":3,"fold":6}

For example, 23 tracks by Germany's SWR Orchestra (the in-house orchestra of Sdwestrundfunk, or Southwest Radio) are taken from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Mozart-100-Collection\/dp\/B0056ANB3M\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Mozart 100 Collection<\/a>, a fine set in its own right.\n\nAlso featuring prominently are piano sonatas and one concerto from Carmen Piazzini, from her very respectable sets released previously by X5 as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mozart-The-Complete-Piano-Sonatas\/dp\/B0023RVZX4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mozart: The Complete Piano Sonatas<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mozart-The-Piano-Concertos\/dp\/B003HHP0R6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mozart: The Piano Concertos<\/a>.\n\nThis is solid music well worth picking up, and at the bargain price it is even ridiculously cheap. I hope X5 revisits its&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/99-Most-Essential-Beethoven-Masterpieces\/dp\/B001NWULS0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">99 Most Essential Beethoven Masterpieces<\/a>&nbsp;as well -- its other main composer-based collection besides the Mozart that used the old strategy of \"greatest hit\" excerpts rather than integral works.

{"text":"Burl Ives really isn't remembered as much as he should be these days; and that's a shame. On this album Burl sings wonderfully; and his friendly, grandfatherly vibes go into every song he sings! This CD is a must-have for fans of Burl; and anyone who wants some very special holiday songs would do well to add this to their music collection. The quality of the sound is very good and the artwork is very nicely done.\n\nThe title track opens the album; this catchy, infectiously happy and upbeat tune could never go out of style; and Burl practically owns this song the way he delivers it. He puts a lot of positive energy into his version of this song; and it shows quite clearly when I hear him perform it. Great! \"Christmas Is a Birthday\" is very easy on the ear; what a charming ballad--and it's religious, too. \"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\" switches gears back to a more secular song; Burl puts his own stamp on this tune by playing a bit with the tempo and a few key changes--and it all holds its own very well.\n\n\"White Christmas\" glows brighter than silver and gold combined when Mr. Ives sings it; that background chorus rounds out the number nicely although wisely the arrangement makes it so that they can't attempt to share the spotlight with Burl. \"The Little Drummer Boy\" has another terrific arrangement; the percussion and guitar are used very well and the music fits perfectly with Burl Ives' singing. In addition, \"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer\" leaves nothing to be desired--this music is all THAT good!\n\n\"Winter Wonderland\" shines bright in Burl's capable hands; I really like this number. \"Silver Bells\" couldn't have been done any better and the CD ends with Burl Ives performing \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.\" I haven't heard this number as often as I've heard the other tunes on this CD but it's really quite beautiful and it even leaves me wanting more.\n\nBurl Ives turned out a wonderful record album back in 1965; and it's amazingly wonderful to have this on CD in our times so that we can enjoy it over and over again. I highly recommend this album; it's full of splendid holiday music.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Fortunately, the cd turned out to be a worthwhile purchase because of the intense and excellent singing as well as the lyrics that were timed with a grittier rock sound (as others have noted, Linkin Park channel some of the energy from their Hybrid Theory days). I purchased the 12 song version (with the addition of the song Guilty All The Same feat. Rakim) and the songs War, Final Masquerade, and Line In The Sand are some of the tracks that captured my attention with the combo of the music and lyrics.

{"text":"Wow, I was taken off guard by this release.  THANK YOU BOB!\n\nI am an old fan of Husker Du, the early Bob Mould solo stuff, and everything he put out with Sugar.  I saw Bob solo and with Sugar live at the small venues in Chicago quite a few times back in the day and these were always very entertaining, sonic and fully charged events (even the acoustic show I once saw).\n\nHis more recent solo stuff I was not really getting into - I really dropped off purchasing anything of Bob Mould's after 1998's The Last Dog and Pony Show because I thought that release was very weak and I only really enjoyed 2 songs off of that.  In my opinion everything put out after that was a waste, up until now!\n\nSilver Age comes along and completely surprises me.  I never saw this coming.  Holy Cow!  Every song is really good although Steam Of Hercules is the weakest track to me.  Silver Age fits really well with the likes of all the Sugar releases as well as Black Sheets Of Rain.  If you liked Black Sheets Of Rain and the Sugar stuff then you will like Silver Age.  I am impressed with this turnaround and I may have to look at his tour schedule now.  Very Good stuff - the ripping guitars, sonic mix, melody, and layered vocals bring back the memories of those earlier releases.  I may have to go buy the remastered Sugar CD's now too.\n\nA solid 5 stars !","classification":5,"fold":6}

Here they bring their particular brand of hybrid Japanese cuteness and toughness to this Ramone's classic, but in the end they stay pretty true to the original.\n\nAnd that's the problem that keeps this back from being among the best Shonen Knife material. Does anyone remember their cover of \"Top of the World\" by the Carpenters from the tribute album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/If-I-Were-a-Carpenter\/dp\/B000005IL6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">If I Were a Carpenter<\/a>? That was brilliant because Shonen Knife brought their punk-inspired driving guitars and rhythms to a song that was originally from the opposite, laid-back, easy-listening end of the pop spectrum. The cover version actually had a transformative effect.\n\nHere, we have a nice cover version by a great band of a classic song by another great band, delivered in a highly similar style. Shonen Knife's affinity with the Ramones makes it tough for them to bring anything really new to the tune -- beyond the cuter, Japanese girl band voice and vibe.\n\nGood, glad to have it, but it doesn't go to 11 or anything.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"For obvious reasons, the \"Rise of the Masters\" series of recordings rings with a certain atmosphere of suspiciion - after all, two- and three-dollar prices for a hundred tracks suggests not necessarily a great deal, but more likely a mix of poor recordings.  In some cases, this is at least partially true; the obscure orchestras featured in the Tchaikovsky and Brahsm sets give acceptable, but less-than-stellar performances of their symphonies and the chamber music, while generally well-played, contains recordings from live performances with the occasional interruption by noisy audience members and long applause sections.\n\nThis set of recordings, however, is a fantastic grouping, for many reasons.  First of all, many of the songs are played by original instruments groups, which are capable of playing the music with a flavor and spectacle modern instruments never good; there is an energy which pervades their recordings which is often lost with modern instruments.\n\nSo, for the price, and for the quality of the recordings, this is one of the better \"Rise of the Masters\" recordings, and, as they all are, one of the more fantastic deals in music.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"55 years of JT albums culminates in an exemplary effort!  I am one of the rare dogs who actually bought his debut album on the Apple label because I was just nuts for anything having to do with The Beatles, so when JAMES TAYLOR came out (same for Mary Hopkins and Badfinger albums) I bought it without knowing anything at all about JT.  I loved him from the get go and even bought what was essentially his rough cut first attempt (James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine) when it was made available after MUD SLIDE SLIM.  If you are a huge fan of JT and want this deluxe model set, you should head straight for the red and white big box store (you know who I mean) and get the exclusive release of this CD which has three more tracks on, all of them from 99 recording sessions (two with Mark Knopfler) and all three of them excellent bonus tracks!  You get 13 tracks instead of 10 and you will pay less than the advertised price here!  (at least in my store it was).\n\nJT is undeniably in my top 5 favorite music acts, nestled right inside of The Beatles, The Moody Blues, Pink Floyd, and Paul Simon (with or without Art Garfunkel), as these are the artists from whom I literally have every single release imagineable (and then there are Santana and Led Zeppelin to add to that so my top, complete collections are all 7 of these artists.  As you see, James is the only solo act (Paul getting sidelined because of the S&G period) who has been a solo act for double nickels of years.  This is his 17th studio album and add to that some nice live issues and a greatest hits package that is required if you want the re-recordings of his first two singles that were reissued and of course the various versions of the sublime Steamroller Blues, it all adds up to a career that has virtually (for most people) all evolved down the track from SWEET BABY JAMES.  He has had some clunkers by the critics standards but not by true fans who find endearment in some of the weaker albums like WALKING MAN, and who have followed his songcraft as it winds its way through the decades.  His last original album, OCTOBER ROAD, charted well and it seemed to have broken a kind of formula, the one where there is at least one blues derivative (a rule beginning with Steamroller) and one oldie cover (which often become hit singles for him), and a third-world infection (1st Of May, Gaia, Lighthouse, etc).  Now after 13 years (with a complete issue of COVERS released midway) a new JT album has finally arrived and all of us are completely gaga again.\n\nYes, Virginia, there IS a bluesy foot tapper (Stretch Of The Highway) including varicose lyrics to chuckle at, there IS actually more than one new agey \/ third world inclusion, and there is even (gasp!) a kind of a protest song, something we haven't gotten from JT in quite a while.  The bottom line here of course is that if you are a fan, you are doubtless not going to not pick this album up, it is really-really-really good, one of his best efforts in the post 80s period.  If you liked HOURGLASS you will certainly like this one.  For me, the weakest track on the album is the leadoff single Today Today Today, which for some reason doesnt do that much for me, maybe it will grow on me, who knows.  The last three tracks on the exclusive release (from that other place with the bulls eye) are well worth the extra $s as I find them solid tracks that were worth inclusion on any of his albums, definitely not throw-away!  (In fact Pretty Boy Floyd is one of my favorites on the CD).\n\nThe bonus DVD movie is really insightful and definitely crafted for his fans.\n\nRecording and engineering on the sound of this production is immaculate, overall a beautifully crafted album by one of the music industries elite and his highly dedicated and ber talented players.  Sting and Yo Yo Ma are perfect seasoning on three songs you will adore.\n\nIf you are not a James Taylor fan, new to his music, or have otherwise just been indifferent, this one might entice you into the fold.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"This is really the biggest surprise of the year thus far. I mean, this girl comes off the American Idol of England, comes to the states, and this song comes out of nowhere building radio play all the way to #1. What's the secret? Apparently America just loves those female R&B Love Song vibes.\n\nLeona Lewis herself has a rather good voice, and carries herself pretty well throughout the song. The song itself is pretty darn standard in the R&B Love Song genre, so it could be sung by Mariah, or any artist in that mold for that matter. No ground is broken, but it is a nice listen, and so far, it has not annoyed me to death, so that's always a positive.\n\nSo overall, nothing brilliant, nothing new, but Leona Lewis seems to nice enough to be let on my radio dial. And, even though this might be saying much, this song might be better than most of Mariah's work, since her stuff is so overly done, it's pathetic. It's also a nice change of pace that Leona isn't practically begging her lover to touch her body like another certain artist has done. ;)","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"The release of \"There Goes My Baby\" in May 1959 marks yet another seminal moment in the long history of this venerable R&B vocal group. Just months earlier the group's manager George Treadwell had disbanded the existing Drifters group and brought in The Five Crowns and renamed that group The Drifters. These \"new\" Drifters were led by a dynamic young lead vocalist named Ben E King and included Charlie Thomas who continues to perform Drifters tunes to this day. The move proved to be a stroke of genius as over the next 5 years The Drifters would prove to be a wildly successful recording act. \"There Goes My Baby\" would spend 19 weeks on the charts peaking at #2 in the summer of 1959. Produced by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, it was one of the first R&B records ever to use strings.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Dopes To Infinity was released in 1995 and was the third full-length studio album from the Red Bank, New Jersey based rock\/metal band Monster Magnet, the album is somewhat of a cult classic within the Stoner Rock genre and is very popular among Monster Magnet fans.\n\nDopes To Infinity contains the single `Negasonic Teenage Warhead' and the popular tracks `Dead Christmas' and `Look To Your Orb For The Warning.'\n\nIn every way, this is a strong album from the band. The lyrics, production, performances and songwriting are all just on top form, with Dave's Vocals in particular really coming in to their own. Stylistically, the album maintains some of the psychedelic touches of its predecessors but overall relies more on riffs and grooves.\n\nHighlights include the memorable `King Of Mars,' as well as the aforementioned `Negasonic Teenage Warhead' and `Look To Your Orb For The Warning,' all of which demonstrate what Monster Magnet were capable of when at their best.\n\nIn summary, Dopes To Infinity is a strong, confident and well written album that contains a lot of classic material and is more than worth a place in any Stoner Rock collection. If you are a fan then hands down you need a copy of Dopes To Infinity and it is indeed a good record to pick up even if you are a prospective fan.","classification":5,"fold":6}

I'm grateful I've been given the opportunity to reach into that peaceful, transcendent moment and share it with others.\" ~ Chris Botti\n\nThe genius of trumpet whose kind of music is so spellbinding has done it again. This recording is a chock-full of lovely ballads splendidly interpreted by Mr. Botti. His  trumpet playing style is exquisitely fabulous and perfect. Each and every track is a treasure! And the entire CD offers delightful renditions by the greatest trumpet player of today, his guest vocalists Sting and Paula Cole, some of the finest arrangers Jeremy Lubbock, Billy Childs, Gil Goldstein, Marc Schulman and Bobby Colomby with the London Session Orchestra and the rest of the studio musicians.\n\nThese timeless tunes were tastefully chosen from the musical treasures of the best songwriters and composers of all-time; George and Ira Gershwin, Richard Rodgers & Lorenz Hart, Irving Berlin, Harold Arlen & Ted Koehler, Edward Heyman & Victor Young, and Paul Edgar Johnson, among others.\n\nMy personal favorites are of course the loveliest classic ever composed and the title track \"When I Fall In Love,\" the silky and smooth sound of Rodgers & Hart's chestnut \"My Romance,\" Irving Berlin's \"What'll I Do?\" with the impressive vocals of Paula Cole and a touch of Mr. Botti's voice on background, the jazzy and upbeat Billy Childs' arrangement of Arlen & Koehler's \"Let's Fall In Love,\" Paul Johnson's \"The Nearness Of You,\" and Gershwins' \"Someone To Watch Over Me\" superbly arranged by Jeremy Lubbock.\n\nThe samba-ish rendition of \"La Belle Dame Sans Regrets\" with vocals by Sting and one of Sade's signature songs \"No Ordinary Love\" are also impressive and noteworthy.\n\nAccording to Chris, \"if his career were to end today, this is the body of work that he is most proud of.\" To me, this recording is truly his crowning glory. Congratulations Mr. Botti for your superb performances on this CD.\n\n* * * * *TEN STARS!* * * * *","classification":5,"fold":6}

She has one of those voices that puts a magic melt on the heart and gathers you in its clutches.

She really didn't deliver a very strong song. AT times, she felt more like she was tired and not enticing. She wanted to try and be a hard core rapper as was the case with Lil' Kim and Beyonce', but instead she ruined her voice.

Ghost Town is a great track, with a different kind of sound than usual pop music, and I was hoping the album would have more songs like that, but it's really more straightforward pop.  Adam's voice is great as usual, it's just that the music isn't as memorable or fun as some of his past songs.  It might grow on me more.

I had it in my car and my girl says \"who is this? I like this.\"  She almost spit out her Starbucks when I said \"Nick Jonas\".  This song grabs you from first listen and Jonas does a great job here sounding like the green monster has grabbed hold of him, nostils flaring and showing his teeth.  \"Teacher\", the 3rd single, follows and it's a pure pop gem.  And...the great songs just continue.  \"Push\" has Jonas channeling his inner Maxwell.  \"Santa Barbara\" has what reminds me of a gospel feel to it.  I am a HUGE fan of \"Wilderness\".  Yeah, it screams I AM PURE POP MUSIC and it has a major Adam Levine\/Maroon 5 vibe to it, but it's just one of those songs you just can't help but play again...and again...and maybe 'one more time'.  \"Numb\" sounds like another single...and the Demi duet is a sure fire future release.\n\nAll and all, the CD has a nice R&B sound to it...sort of glides from one song to the next in a JT fashion.

{"text":"Kansas needs no introduction, and most of us that grew up listening to rock in the 1970's practically worshiped everything this band put out from 1974 to 1980. I still have the original records that I listened to over and over again as a kid and adolescent. Rush and Kansas basically formed the basis for my love of progressive music. Needless to say, even though I've read some of this stuff over the years (especially in Kerry Livgren's Seeds of Change book) it's great to finally have this story - from each of the original band member's perspective - in detail in a nice, concise and professional DVD documentary. Supplemented by vintage video clips and photos, this documentary tells the fascinating \"rags to riches\" story of the first segment in the history this iconic American band. This 78 minute film is not a documentary of the entire history of the band but instead covers the segment of the band's history from inception to the Point of Know Return era. Clearly this was their most influential and miraculous period for numerous reasons. Not only did they go from a no name bar band to multi-million record selling stadium act in 3 to 4 years but they also released 5 brilliant albums during that same time - each distinctly different from the other and certainly something Kansas themselves would never be able to duplicate. This film tells us all about everything in between with tons of great stories\/anecdotes by each of the original members. Some of the stories are really fun too like the \"free beer\" show and the \"McDonalds promotional dinner\" and Steven Tyler's jealous plot to sabotage the Kansas set. What struck me watching this was just how humble these guys are, and the fact that all of them are actually participating in this film. How many bands can do a documentary like this some 40 years later with all of the original members alive and well? Even the mighty Rush had its casualty to the world of excess.\n\nFrom a presentation standpoint, the DVD is pretty Spartan and includes the documentary feature (in 10 chapters) with additional credits at the end. Subtitles are available in English, Spanish, Italian, German and French; audio in PCM stereo or 5.1 DD. The packaging is high quality over-sized tri-fold digi-pak with the audio CD in the left-side pocket, booklet in the middle section and DVD in the right pocket in its own slipcase. The \"then and now\" photos from \"the mound in the storm\" adorn the outer and inner cover of the packaging and seems only appropriate given how iconic that photo became over the years. The booklet contains a concise written summary of the band's early history (culling information from the film) and the usual music and film credits along with a few extra photos. Overall, it would have been nice to see a few more extras but for what this film and release are trying to accomplish its just fine.\n\nThe audio CD (near 80 minutes in duration) contains \"dialogue\" excerpts from the documentary introducing most of the songs so this plays out like an \"audio history\" of Kansas. The sound quality is excellent and would assume these versions came from the Glixman remastered Legacy reissues. No surprises as to the songs included - this collection including the 1974 \"pseudo live\" version of \"Can I Tell You\" from Don Kirshner's Rock Concert as somewhat of a bonus.\n\nInstead of looking at this as a fan release with all kinds of coveted never before released songs and details only available to the select few that can actually score a copy - which this clearly is not - I take it at face value: a concise historical document about the miraculous and incredibly uplifting story of the early years in the career of one of the greatest rock bands of all time.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"By 1967 Frank Sinatra was riding yet another wave of artistic and popular success. After career highs as a big band singer, a solo artist for Columbia, an innovative solo artist for Capitol and the founder of his own label, Reprise, Sinatra found commercial gold in 1966 with \"Strangers in the Night\" and \"That's Life.\" In 1967 he recorded both the chart-topping \"Something Stupid\" and this artistically rich album of bossa nova tunes. Pairing with Brazil's most popular musical exponent, Sinatra gave Antonio Carlos Jobim's originals (and three American songbook standards) the deft lyrical touch that marked the vocalist's best recordings. Jobim, in turn, gave Sinatra a hip outlet that was more sophisticated than reworking contemporary pop songs. Also contributing to the superb final results was arranger\/conductor Claus Ogerman, whose charts gave Sinatra space to sing with a quiet ease.\n\nSinatra sounds unusually relaxed in these sessions, swinging ever so lightly to Jobim's percussive finger-played acoustic guitar, and the moody strings, breezy woodwinds and muted horns of Ogerman's arrangements. The easy tempos give Sinatra a chance to explore Jobim's songs, hold notes and show off the textures of his voice. The recording and mix show off the brilliant results engineer Lee Herschberg accomplished in capturing the nuances of Sinatra's voice. Jobim adds vocal support with occasional alternating or duet lines, and provides both Brazilian flavor and contrast that highlight the incredible quality of Sinatra's tone. Three nighttime sessions yielded ten final tracks, which were released as the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Francis-Albert-Sinatra-Antonio-Carlos-Jobim\/dp\/B000006OBR\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim<\/a>, and climbed into the Top 20 on the album chart.\n\nSinatra moved on to other projects, including an album with Duke Ellington (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Francis-A-Edward-K\/dp\/B000002K9R\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Francis A. & Edward K.<\/a>), a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/family-Christmas-album\/dp\/B00002Z781\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">family Christmas album<\/a>, an album of pop and folk rock (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Cycles\/dp\/B002W9J5GW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cycles<\/a>), and the triumphant&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/My-Way\/dp\/B0020H46ME\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">My Way<\/a>. But in 1969 he and Jobim returned to Western Recorders for three more nights to lay down ten more bossa nova styled tracks for an album tentatively titled Sinatra-Jobim. But two years later on, Jobim was writing more complex melodies that weren't as easy for Sinatra to vocalize, and new arranger Eumir Deodato's charts are more insistent than those Claus Ogerman scripted for the first album. Sinatra sounds rehearsed (which he was) rather than organically warmed up, and his vocals don't lay into the arrangements as effortlessly or seamlessly as before. Still, there's chemistry between Sinatra and Jobim, and though the former was particularly unhappy with his performances on \"Bonita,\" \"Off Key (Desafinado)\" and \"The Song of the Sabia,\" the project went ahead with its release plan.\n\nSinatra-Jobim was finalized, cover art produced and a limited number of 8-track tape editions released to market before Sinatra killed the project. The 8-tracks that got into the wild have since become collectors' items. The seven tracks with which Sinatra was relatively happy were re-released in 1971 as side one of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sinatra-Company\/dp\/B002N9MK9K\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sinatra & Company<\/a>, two more (\"Bonita\" and \"The Song of the Sabia\") were later released on the 1977 Reprise compilation Portrait of Sinatra, and the 1977 Brazilian double-LP Sinatra-Jobim Sessions, and the third (\"Off Key (Desafinado)\") was finally released on 1995's epic&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Complete-Reprise-Studio-Recordings\/dp\/B00000DG1M\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Complete Reprise Studio Recordings<\/a>. Pulled together into a single 58-minute disc, it turns out Sinatra was right, the vocals from the second sessions, particularly the three delayed tracks, are not up to his standards. The stars simply didn't align for the 1969 sessions as they did two years earlier.\n\nThe cool of \"Girl From Ipanema,\" the thoughtful regret and sadness of \"How Insensitive,\" and the percussive delicacy of \"Baubles, Bangles and Beads\" aren't matched by anything on the follow-up. Sinatra and Jobim were deeply in the pocket for their initial collaboration, and though \"Don't Every Go Away\" and \"Wave\" find them once again simpatico, Sinatra simply wasn't as deft the second time out. Concord's reissue includes the cover art (and unprocessed base photograph) of the aborted Sinatra-Jobim album, and a cropped, black-and-white version of the first album's cover photo. Veteran Warner Brothers\/Reprise writer Stan Cornyn provides new liner notes in his typical riff-heavy, hyperbolic style, and Dan Hersch's 24-bit digital remastering sparkles. All that's really missing is Sinatra and Jobim's 1994 collaboration on \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" but that's a nit: the first album is gold, with or without extras.

{"text":"I have always liked Aoife O'Donvan's work, but I felt that her first solo album, Fossils, had just a bit too much smooth corporate gloss over it to really speak to me.  Here, she speaks from the heart, her songwriting and performing is natural and unadulterated and she has a superb band.  It makes for a very good album, I think.\n\nThis album is a sort of elegy for her Irish grandfather who died aged 93 as O'Donovan was conceiving the album, and is also an exploration of her Irish roots and ties.  It has a thoughtful, elegiac atmosphere and much of it is very lovely.  There is often quite a striking contrast between O'Donovan's slightly breathy, aetherial delivery and the emotional punch in her music and lyrics, and that is very effective here  I find the whole thing both beautiful and affecting.\n\nPartly this is because of the wonderful collaborators she has assembled here.  Both the brilliant Chris Thile and the entirely wonderful Sarah Jarosz are in the band, and the rest of the musicians are just as good.  It's virtuosic, musically intelligent stuff and this time the production is pitch-perfect, I think, so the whole thing sounds as though every note means something.\n\nIn The Magic Hour has both beauty and depth to it.  I like it a lot and I can warmly recommend this album.\n\n(I can also strongly recommend Sarah Jarosz's album Build Me Up From Bones, which is a firm favourite of mine.)","classification":5,"fold":6}

Despite the efforts of music producers to shine up the radio edit, \"Cups\" still feels like a typical acapella song that would be more at home in a glee club than in the Top 10.  That being said, \"Cups\" is a pleasant enough song and showcases that actress Anna Kendrick has a good soft singing voice.  I'll be interested to see what becomes of this aspect of her career.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"Guetta and Sam catch us with an ominous tickle of the piano keys backed by subtle strings, building up into a late '70s funk groove.  I took off a fifth star solely due to the excessive dynamic range compression required nowadays to satisfy the unquenchable thirst of musicians and labels for tracks to be made louder amd louder.  On my Foobar 2000 meter this track clocked in at DR4 - equivalent to 4dB of crest factor, or average to peak loudness!  That's shameful, given digital audio's potential for 90dB of dynamic range or more.  Artists: Please stop demanding your music be so loud it has to be squashed into digital full scale!  Your creative juices are flowing - let them explode in all their sonic glory in digital!","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"\"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\" has taken on a life of its own in the career of Bruce Springsteen.  Despite never being released as a single, it may well rank as his most popular and beloved song.  It was the show closer from the time of its release in 1973 until 10\/19\/84 on the Born In The USA tour when it would never be played to close a show again.  What was once considered an absolute in a Springsteen concert is now a cherish gift if he plays it in a show.  The song is the second song in row on the album that deals with forbidden love.  This time it's Rosalita's parents that don't approve of his daughter's suitor's playing in a rock & roll band.  The song opens with the familiar guitar jangle and is carried throughout by Clarence Clemons blazing sax.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"At a time when soldiers were viewed by many as anti-American and were being degraded for fighting in Viet Nam; SSgt. Barry Sadler, US Army, Green Beret, recorded this immortal song and injected a feeling of patriotism into an America divided by many issues. The 'Great Society' envisioned by LBJ was just a mirage in the distance that could never be reached as white and black Americans tried to come to terms with centuries of injustice and factions of Americans turned to drugs and isolation and created a counter-culture in an effort to escape governmental control. The war in Viet Nam was an ever-escalating affair that was not going the way it was suposed to go and was causing no end of discontent among American citizens who longed for peace. The President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, had been assasinated a few years earlier ending any chance we had for a revival of 'Camelot', an event that was soon to be repeated by the murders of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and John's younger brother Bobby. There were riots in the streets of most of America's major cities as black Americans, tired of being referred to as 'Africans' and other less savory titles, angrily demanded recognition and acceptance as Americans by their white counterparts. Draftees returning from duty in Viet Nam found themselves targets of tomato-throwers as if they had done some grievous misdeed by following orders. In the midst of all this was heard the steady voice of SSgt. Sadler. Suddenly, if only temporarily, our sight was focused on the bravery and unselfishness of our military members and we felt a rush of pride as we listened. Here was a song that was not about drugs...not about sex...not about money...it was a song about Americans, both black and white, who were ready to give their all for the rest of us. For a moment we forgot about the troubles...forgot about the turmoil...forgot about our differences...and remembered our heritage. For a moment we were in Camelot...and the Great Society was real.","classification":4,"fold":6}

Is this song and video the sign of the apocalypse coming?  Come on, people!  It's just a song by a young girl who is trying to have a little fun with this gift of recording time from her parents.\n\n  The awful lyrics in the song are no fault of Rebecca's.  They were written by the production company, Ark Music Factory.  Ark also has to take the blame for the production quality.  Rebecca's voice leaves a bit to be desired.  But, she is just 13 and, if Fergie's non-existent voice can be made spectacular by `studio magic', then Rebecca Black has a chance, too.\n\n  In the end, this is just a slightly amusing, breezy, insignificant pop tune.  Rebecca seems to have enjoyed making it and she seems to `get it' about the notoriety it has brought her.  It's just `fun, fun, fun, fun'.","classification":3,"fold":6}

However,  after researching info for a college project (around early 2010) about military conflicts between military forces from Russia and citizens in Afghanistan (during 1980s) and how it tied into the  2000s era of Afghanistan and U.S. military affairs leaves me wanting to avoid publicly saying more.

{"text":"When it has came down to Jennifer Lopez, she hasn't really brought out her better songs out there. It has felt more like the same thing she has done before with her songs, which sadly has felt old, and not exciting anymore. She has made so many dance songs, that it doesn't feel like she excites anymore. Live It Up, her first after leaving MCA. Her last album did not do the trick very well, and her cavalcade of consecutive dance songs have felt less intriguing than exciting. Her latest dance song Live It Up with Pitbull doesn't actually feel like she has brought out more than her A game. It feel like the same thing she has done before, from her recent songs like Dance Again, and Goin' In. I really didn't feel Jennifer brought out something different. I think if Jennifer Lopez wants to get out more for her music, she should try and deliver better than feeling like she has done the same song from before.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":6}

That was shown strongly with Nicki Minaj earlier this year with Your Love sampling Annie Lennox's No More I Love You's, and sadly for The Black Eyed Peas, they are right in that same feeling with their single The Time (Dirty Bit,) the lead single off their album The Beginning. I really wasn't impressed with the sample of the Dirty Dancing classic that Bill Medley & Jennifer Warnes made strongly a classic with their collaboration from Dirty Dancing of I've Had The Time Of My Life.  If it was a tribute to the late Patrick Swayze whom died of cancer last year, it just really wasn't a strong take. I honestly was a bit more impressed with I've Got A Feeling from The E.N.D.

{"text":"The indie rock band modest Mouse has come a long way since their humble beginnings in a small town in Washington. The band- fronted by the eccentric Isaac Brock- got their start by releasing an EP in 1994. After that, they issued their 1996 formal debut \"This Is A Long Drive For Someone With Nothing To Think About\". The following year saw the release of \"The Lonesome Crowded West\" which became their final recording on the Seattle based label Up Records. In 2000, they signed to major label Epic Records for the release of 'The Moon & Antarctica\". Although the project was critically acclaimed, it wasn't successful- save for one of the songs being used in a commercial for a Nissan vehicle. After the issue of another EP \"Everywhere And His Nasty Parlour Tricks\", Modest Mouse saw their greatest success with their 2004 effort \"Good News For people Who Love Bad News\". The album contained the huge hit singles \"Float On\" (which would later be sampled by Lupe Fiasco for his record company bashing \"The Show Goes On\") and the harsh look at death \"Ocean Breathes Salty\". In 2007 came \"We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank\" which yielded the singles \"Dashboard\" and \"Missed The Boat\". However, by that time, original drummer Jeremiah Green returned to play on the album as well as getting help from former member of The Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr. Another EP \"No One's First And You're Next\" was released before the band went into seclusion by the turn of the 2010's.\n\nModest Mouse spent the next few years doing live shows and constantly recording. Before they could release a new record, the group dealt with changes once again. The first of which was having to make a new album without their longtime bassist Eric Judy (who has since been replaced by Russell Higbee). The second change was more of a corporate nature: Pop music executive L.A. Reid had just become the CEO of their label Epic Records during the recording of their new album \"Strangers To Ourselves\". The recording was produced by Issac Brock with help from Tucker Martine (who also produced Tift Merritt's albums \"See You On The Moon\" and \"Travelling Alone\"). Musically, it's a surprisingly upbeat effort, but its lyrical content has an edge of dark humor- look no further than the danceable \"Pistol (A. Cunanan, Miami FL. 1996)\", which retraced the beginnings of serial killer Andrew Cunanan- the shooter who ended up killing fashion designer Gianni Versace. The album starts off with the title track \"Strangers To Ourselves\", while they mock the current generation of millennials on the first single \"Lampshades On Fire\". He sings about going on a search party to find his lost brother who turned up missing on \"Ansel\" and relaying the message of the burial of a lost package on the ballad \"S**t In Your Cut\". They tell a dark story of ghosts and larceny on \"The Tortoise And The Tourist\" and close the recording with the ballad \"Of Course We Know\". Modest Mouse delivered a great album with \"Strangers To Ourselves\". It took them nearly a decade to make it, and let's hope that it will not take almost another decade for a proper follow up.","classification":5,"fold":6}
{"text":"The title track of Tunnel Of Love uses the classic amusement park ride as a way to examine his own marriage.  Just like the ride, marriage ought to be easy, ought to be simple enough, a man meets a woman and they fall in love.  But it's not that easy, there are bumps in the ride and sometimes it gets rough.  Mr. Springsteen's first marriage was failing at the time and the line it is easy for two people to lose each other is quite prophetic as the marriage ended up in divorce.  The music perfectly captures the carnival mood of the piece and Nils Lofgren's guitar solo cuts through the joyful sound like a razor blade acting as the tension that cuts through the rocky relationship. The song fades out with the recording of the sounds of a real roller coaster from Pt. Pleasant Beach, NJ.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"\"Keepsakes in the Attic\" is the sixth solo piano album from composer\/ pianist\/ arranger\/clinical psychologist\/ professor \/ researcher\/ hang glider\/ 21st century Renaissance Man (whew!) Jeff Bjorck. This is the first album that Bjorck has released that doesnt begin and end with favorite hymns, but Bjorcks love of hymns often carries over and influences his original music, as it does with several of the thirteen tracks on this album. Twelve of the pieces are original compositions and one is Bjorcks arrangement of an old Swedish hymn, Tryggare Kan Ingen Vara (Children of the Heavenly Father) that reminds him of his early years. Bjorcks concept for the album was the idea of spending an afternoon in the attic of an old house, rummaging through various keepsakes belonging to you or your loved ones and the emotions that those discoveries and memories evoke. This idea is also the perfect framework for Bjorcks love for iconic turn-of-the-20th-century melodic structures and the range of emotions they express. It is also interesting to note that the keepsakes pictured in the album artwork are actual heirlooms from Bjorcks family, making this album deeply personal yet universally relatable.\n\n\"Keepsakes in the Attic\" begins with Afternoon Reverie, setting the nostalgic tone of the album with bittersweet grace and elegance. Returning Home recalls times driving long distances back to Bjorcks hometown to visit his parents and the homesick feelings he experienced as he revisited familiar places along the way - feelings that were immediately cured as soon as he walked through the front door. Grandads Rocker affectionately recalls an old rocking chair and the person who occupied it before it came to his own family - ah, the tales a chair like that could tell! Hearts Far Apart was inspired by Bjorcks own yearning for his wife when they are far apart. With tangible musical expression of deep love, this is an especially moving tribute. Grooms First Waltz is much lighter and happier, reminding me in places of my favorite hymn, In the Garden. It begins tentatively, imagining a young groom unaccustomed to dancing, and becomes more confident and flowing as he relaxes and enjoys the dance with his new bride - a sweet and delightful piece! Hope in the Heartache is something of a sequel to Bjorcks 1991 composition, Waiting For Farewell, composed during the last weeks of his fathers life. With the recent loss of one of his closest friends, this newer piece is dedicated to his memory and to the hope of seeing him (and his father) again one day. The lighter tone of the closing section reflects on that hope. Playing Catch with Dad happily recalls a favorite childhood pastime and time spent with a beloved father. Justine of County Clare feels like an older hymn and recalls stories Bjorcks mother told him about his grandmother, who died two years before he was born. Nanas Music Box ends this beautiful album with an imaginary keepsake, an antique music box that a loving grandmother would allow her small grandchildren to play when they visited her. Played in the upper registers of the piano, this gentle little piece gradually trails off at the end, suggesting that the lid of the music box has been left open so the echoes and memories can continue on in the listeners heart.\n\nI have enjoyed all of Jeff Bjorcks albums, but I think this is his best and most personal album yet. Very highly recommended!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"One thing that I don't like about today's music is that it's geared toward the lowest common denominator: sex, or the act itself. Now, I'm not a prude by any means, but shouldn't a song leave a lot to the listener's imagination? That's why a lot of the 'old school' singers from 25-50 years ago could make songs that actually hold up better today than most of the pre-fabricated, over produced slop that infects popular music, especially R&B today.\n\nSullivan's music is what is needed today: you still acknowledge today's styles and what not, but you still work on the main thing: making the song memorable and letting the listener fills in the blanks so to speak.\n\nShe is pretty, that is no doubt. But, I'm more impressed with her singing qualities and her song writing skills, because she'll need those qualities if she wants to be a long lasting star, after she's not the hot young singer of the moment.\n\nI think that she'll last a long time if she keeps on doing what she's doing: making sure her voice, writing, and talent always take center stage.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"When vibraphonist Jackson accepted a recording date with pianist Peterson in 1961, along came the other two members of Oscar's trio, Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums. While bass and drums remain in the background of this excellent CD, Brown and Thigpen were great players, and add a lot to the success of this effort. The opener, \"Green Dolphin Street\" is relaxed, but \"Heartstrings\" and \"Work Song\" jump. Then comes the wonderful, almost eight-minute take on \"John Brown's Body\" that soars. The final two cuts, \"A Wonderful Guy\" and \"Reunion Blues\" are also superb. Milt and Oscar, of course, went on to do great work up to the mid-90's, but they were already old pros 41 years ago. If you have a friend who is afraid of jazz, play this for him or her. It's a perfect blend of the four instruments and a great introduction to the category.","classification":5,"fold":6}

I've grown tired of this and have decided to avoid Amazon mp3's all together and will take my business to Itunes instead. Also, I thought it might be my system, but it hasn't failed with any other mp3 provider or download service - plus I recently installed a new, state of the art router.

{"text":"When I first heard about GOIN' DOWN ROCKIN', I was less than floored.  Let's face it: Waylon's best music came around in the seventies, and while he still remained a reliable singer\/songwriter\/musician up until his death, whenever a legend dies, people flock to take advantage of it.  Waylon passed away ten years ago, all the more reason to be suspect of this album.\n\nSurprisingly, ROCKIN' is a solid album.  There are moments that feel unfinished (\"The Ways of the World\" definitely feels incomplete), but the album as a whole is very rewarding.  Even yet another rendition of \"I Do Believe\" feels kind of fresh; perhaps its the honesty with which he wrote it, or the knowledge that we're hearing it posthumously.  He gives a heartfelt take of \"Belle of the Ball,\" an album highlight; and even in the light-hearted \"If My Harley Was Runnin',\" he offers up a moment of pure poeticism: \"There are places in Texas a man can still get lost.\"\n\nHis voice in fine form right up to his passing, Waylon Jennings remains one of those landmark singers, who transcended genre and crafted some truly beautiful music.  As far as posthumous releases go, GOIN' DOWN ROCKIN' is up there among the best; you don't expect performances of this calibre after an artists passes away, and certainly not something so revisionist as \"Sad Songs and Waltzes\" (even if his version pales next to Willie Nelson's original).  This is perhaps an album exclusively for Waylon fans; yet don't let that put you off, thinking that it's some hack collection.  These are solid recordings featuring some great songs.  While this probably isn't the last \"new\" music we'll hear from Waylon, odds are it'll be the last truly good stuff, so if you're a fan, there's little reason to pass this album up.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Debut release from Brooklyn band who play a sort of 80s style darkwave dreampop--soaring,\n  hypnotic, beautifully charming songs that combine minor key drone chords with elevated jangle-\n  pop pathos; and place crystalline, ringing tremolo guitar notes over waves of gentle, atmospheric\n  synthesizers.  The songs are driven by a carefully relentless rhythm, like the never-ending lope\n  of a determined desert camel, and delivered in irresistibly short bursts of enchanting, focused\n  melody.  Vocals, when present, exist as an otherworldly background compliment to the\n  instruments.  There's a sense of unlimited potential, of sun spilling through the clouds in the sky\n  here--tempered by the feeling that the melancholy of reality's bite is never far away.  Includes\n  members from Beach Fossils & the Smith Westerns.  Recalls bands like Felt, Durutti Column,\n  Real Estate, New Order, the Cure, Blue China, Fra Lippo Lippi, Robin Guthrie\/Cocteau Twins.\n  Subtly stunning, gorgeous and completely captivating; this is an album that I could live with for a\n  while.

{"text":"I'll admit to being a very casual Linkin Park listener; not that I didn't dig their stuff, but I was never into them so much that I'd become a fan.  Back in my retail days working at Virgin Megastore, we'd get (over) exposed to tons of s*** on a daily basis; so much that you'd literally start turning it into background noise.  But some things stood out and the band was one of them.  So it'll be obvious I don't know enough to go into a complete breakdown of what's happening on their new release, The Hunting Party, but I do know that it's different than what I've previously heard from them... and I like it.\n\nGuitarist Brad Delson joked the album was an \"alternative Hybrid Theory\" and \"maybe its prequel\", in that it was inspired by artists they all had listened to growing up.  Maybe so, but this is almost all straight up hard stuff- no chaser.  Almost every track is fueled by power riffs and distortion solos from Delson, Chester's trademark vocal range and Shinoda's breakdown raps and electronic touches with a little help from System of A Down's Daron Malakian (you'll know that one when you hear it!), as well as rap icon Rakim to keep with the traditional rap-metal vibe.  Tom Morello and Page Hamilton also make appearances, but even so, very little remains linking back to the halcyon days of Hybrid Theory and Meteora.  And that's the point; they're acknowledging their roots while moving beyond them.  Mike Shinoda stated in interviews that when working on the followup to Living Things he realized he was doing the exact same stuff all over again, and he needed to stop.  No more emo crap... well, not so much; they're all grown men now and what ticks off adults is different from what does kids.  Adding to this was most of the songs were written on the fly while in studio.  The new dynamic was so grueling that drummer Rob Bourdon physically wore himself down trying to keep pace and ended up seeing a chiropractor from throwing his back out during the long recording sessions.  Plus you get some seemingly random lo-fi recordings tacked on to the beginning and end of the first few cuts- I've no idea why.\n\nSo was it worth it all?  Yep!\n\nNot quite a headbanger's ball, but pretty damn close!  First track is kinda disjointed and scattered, but sets the tone for what's to come.  The standouts are All for Nothing, War, Wastelands, Until It's Gone, and Rebellion- power guitars, speed drumming, heavy metal screaming and shouting... this one has it all!  The extended version comes with some live versions of some the songs, and the bonus disc is a treat with some excellent live performances of classics like Bleed it Out and In The End.  This is some good stuff and definitely not your twenty-something Linkin Park anymore.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"\"Heavy As a Feather\" is the second release by pianist\/composer Kathryn Kaye, quickly following her very impressive debut, \"Dreaming Still.\" Produced by Will Ackerman at Imaginary Road Studios, recorded by Tom Eaton, and mastered by Corin Nelsen, the eleven original tracks include four piano solos and seven ensemble pieces from duets to larger groups. The music reflects a variety of influences that includes folksongs and hymns from childhood, ten years of classical music training, an international performing career, and the beauty of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado where Kaye makes her home. Supporting musicians include Ackerman (guitar), Charlie Bisharat (violin), Eugene Friesen (cello), Jill Haley (English horn), Tony Levin (bass), Michael Manring (fretless bass), and Ramesh (percussion). The piano is always front and center, but Kaye graciously gives the other musicians plenty of room to shine. The uncluttered melodies are played with such heartfelt expression that each becomes a distinctive gem as well as part of a flowing, cohesive whole.\n\n\"Heavy As a Feather\" begins with the lovely \"Mountain Laurel,\" a piano solo bathed in spring breezes and dappled sunshine. \"Meadow Morning\" is a quintet for cello, English horn, piano, percussion,and bass. Peaceful contentment flows from each note, painting a picture in beautiful greens and pastel tones. \"An Empty Street in Prague\" is worth the price of the CD all by itself. It begins as a mournful piano solo - simple yet deeply emotional. When Charlie Bisharat enters with his violin a little past the halfway point, the music becomes tragic and heart-breaking. I really love this track! \"So Much Sky\" is a gorgeous piano solo - spare, graceful, and evocative. \"Summer Afternoon\" begins as a languid piano solo, but when Haley adds the voice of the English horn, it really becomes relaxed and downright lazy - delicious! \"How Deep, How Simple\" brings back Ackerman, Bisharat, Eaton, and Friesen for an easy-going tribute to the profound beauty of simplicity. \"Dusk at Rockhouse Creek\" is a quiet piano solo that tells of the stillness of the coming night as the day recedes from the sky. Very open and spacious, you can almost see stars starting to twinkle as the sky darkens. The title track is a duet for cello and piano with gentle strains that seem to float on the air - hence the title, I'm sure. It's amazing how much an artist can convey with so few notes. \"One Last Quiet Breath,\" a solemn but very relaxed piano solo, ends the album with a peaceful kind of grace that will have you coming back for more!\n\n\"Heavy As a Feather\" proves beyond a doubt that Kathryn Kaye will not be joining the long list of one-hit wonders! This is a great album, and I recommend it!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"It's been a long wait but after four years Austin rockers Spoon have graced us with their new record, They Want My Soul. And is it ever sweet.\n\nEverything about this record works beautifully, combining Spoon's traditional sound with subtle nuances and productions flourishes that build on what's come before. The opener Rent I Pay is instantly recognizable, carrying the group's attitude and energy in style. The album's title track is not only fun but once again will feel familiar to fans without coming off as recycled. Let Me Be Mine isn't far behind and reminds us of what this group can do with a solid beat and infectious groove. These throwbacks are stellar but they're only the beginning of where this LP shines.\n\nFrontman Britt Daniel hasn't left his witty lyrics and catchy melodies behind. Rainy Taxi, complete with its 70's guitars, is a highlight and instantly became a favorite of mine. Do You and Outlier are both poppy excursions into what Spoon does best. The Tom Petty-inspired I Just Don't Understand is another highlight, as is New York Kiss. Perhaps the finest moment comes with Inside Out. From its atmospheric intro, dreamy keyboard swirls and subtle hip hop beat, it's undeniably my favorite cut on the record.\n\nThe one minor complaint I have is in the production department. The sound is pretty compressed and it takes a track like Knock Knock Knock, which is itself a great song, and makes it far too abrasive. It's not enough to really bring the record down but it is unfortunate that such a wonderful album suffers from less than ideal production. Bringing Dave Fridmann on board as part of the production staff is most likely to blame for this. Much like his work with The Flaming Lips and MGMT, he manages to take great songs and add abrasive production that wears on your ears. The record is still wonderful but it is a factor that some audiophiles may take issue with.\n\nThey Want My Soul is incredibly fun. It's not only one of Spoon's best records but also one of the best releases of 2014. Aside from some production hiccups the album is outstanding and should easily please fans and newcomers alike. It feels familiar and yet contains enough lane changes to make repeated listens a new adventure. It's good to have them back.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Miles ahead of its time, maturely written, and packed with classics even someone living on Jupiter will have heard, this is... ha! I fooled you, didn't I? This album really gets 2.5 stars. I just thought it would be funny if I ever gave anything by Mr. Browne the highest possible score. Anyway, this is slightly better than the debut, containing a whopping five good songs rather than four. I don't think you need me here to tell you that \"Take It Easy\" is better heard here than by the Eagles (Jackson wrote the damn thing); \"Redneck Friend\" is easily the best of his few rockers, and its sense of humor is a nice change of pace from his usual overtly-serious style; \"For Everyman\" is a bit overlong but has the best guitar solo Browne ever recorded; \"These Days\" (later covered by Gregg Allman) goes from country-rock to relatively full-on rock; and the slow-building \"I Thought I Was a Child\" is interesting too. But some of it's more of the same, just one turgid country-rocker after another - \"Our Lady of the Well\", \"Ready or Not\", etc. Better than the debut, at least.

But for him to really have that success after Culture Club, it has been more bittersweet than absolutely strong, in the way that others like George Michael  had shown after leaving Wham. But nevertheless, with the very least he did have one good song after Culture Club. The Crying Game still remains one of the more-driven movie songs of the 90's that shows Boy George at heart and voice. It is a great song to listen to today, as it was back then.

{"text":"I have always loved Pat Benatar. I believe she was trained as an opera singer. This training has given her the ability to belt out any song in her unique style. The title \"Hell is for Children\" basically speaks for itself. It's the story of child abuse and the lies they have to tell to others to cover up the bruises & shame they feel, as though it is their fault. Pat Benatar sings it with so much conviction as to how she feels about child abuse in this world.

{"text":"R&B singer Trey Songz releases his fifth studio effort, 2012's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Chapter-V\/dp\/B0082MSWNK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Chapter V<\/a>&nbsp;as a follow up to 2010's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Passion-Pain-Pleasure\/dp\/B003UW6WLQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Passion, Pain & Pleasure<\/a>.  The artist continues in a sensual and sometimes salacious direction on Chapter V, highly inspired by his idol, R. Kelly. Songz doesn't tread too far from the formula of his most recent albums, though that doesn't impair Chapter V's consistency in the least.\n\nThe intro, titled \"Chapter V\" sets the tone of the effort. \"Dive In\" starts the effort strongly, given  its slow tempo and sensual sensibilities. Songz does little to differentiate this from say \"Neighbors Know My Name\" or similarly veined cuts, but `if it ain't broke, don't fix it' is not a bad adherence here. The salacious \"Panty Wetter\" proceeds, finding Songz sounding edgy and emulating R. Kelly both thematically and vocally.  Risqu without being too raw, Trey controls himself.\n\n\"Heart Attack,\" the promo single co-penned by R&B hit-maker Rico Love, is a highlight. Characterized by big drums and a hint of synths, Songz sounds exceptional overall:  \"In too deep, can't think about giving it up\/but I never knew, love would feel like a heart attack\/It's killing me, swear I never cried so much\/cause I never knew love would hurt this bad...\"\n\"Playin Hard\" finds Songz returning to his days as an MC.  A bit odd and even clunky at first, \"Playin' Hard\" eventually unfurls its magic. The production serves as a sound backdrop for Songz's `spitting' and `crooning,' though falls short of the glory of \"Dive In\" or \"Heart Attack.\"\n\n\"2 Reasons\" is a \"Bottoms Up\" remake, though a downgrade at best. Production is the cut's solid point, T.I.'s downgraded swag shows on his clumsy, indecipherable verse. No more corny is than the Trey's hook: \"I only came for the ladies and the drinks...\" \"Hail Mary\" atones with it's hardcore sound. Jeezy and Lil Wayne assist solidly. Catchy and enjoyable, \"Hail Mary\" works well. Staying in hip-hop sensibility, Songz adds Rick Ross on \"Don't Be Scared,\" another solid, though not `earth shattering' cut.\n\n\"Pretty Girls Lie\" is a pleasant surprise as it gives Songz a different sound than the audience is accustomed to. \"Pretty girls lie\/lipstick in her smile\/make you want to believe\/but pretty girls lie\/pain so deep inside\/she can't even see\/pretty girls lie...,\" Songz sings in heartfelt fashion.  Add an well composed key change and Songz instantly shows more range and credibility as an artist.\n\"Bad Decisions\" a Drake-styled R&B track follows. Songz sings well here, but the song feels a bit static even given Songz's musical prowess.\n\n\"Forever Yours\" allows Songz to reference `undies' once more, a topic that seems `near and dear' to his heart. The use of synths and electronic sensibility is tasteful and balanced.  A sensually-contrived interlude, \"Inside Interlewd\"  precedes the football-referencing \"Fumble.\"\n\n\"Fumble\" finds the tempo slow and Songz's vocals crystal clear.  Characterized by excellent nuance and high emotion, \"Fumble\" is an `ace-in-the-hole' type of cut for Songz. \"Without A Woman\" proves none too shabby itself, finding Songz drawing more comparisons to his musical  `daddy,' R. Kelly.\n\n\"Interlude4u\" proceeds, followed by the ok, but not great pop-R&B crossover \"Simply Amazing.\"  Penultimate cut \"Never Again\" sampes Curtis Mayfield and perhaps is a shade better than \"Simply Amazing.\" \"Check Me Out\" adds Meek Mill and Diddy and can be characterized as `clubby.'\n\nOverall,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Chapter-V\/dp\/B0082MSWNK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Chapter V<\/a>&nbsp;is solid and enjoyable. It is not the best R&B album of the year per say, but it is consistent, solid, and entertaining by all means.","classification":4,"fold":6}

Let's face it, the voice actors in the movie are trying to actually act the part, even whilst singing, and usually pull it off very well (I still get choked up watching the official video for this one on YouTube. It's one reason we finally got the DVD). To the Top-40 singers, it's just another song gig, and they can yawn through it (and usually do). :-\/\n\nIdina Menzel's rendition is spot-on, and very authentic!

{"text":"Anyone listening to this album should literally expect nothing but George doing whatever he finds is funky. Meaning you can go from motown old school cover of As In (yes the Bootsy song) to dirty funky raps (Nuclear Dog pt. 2 and I Mo B Yodog Fo Eva). While Bootsy, Bernie, Eddie (RIP), Gary (RIP), and Junie are not on a single track (as far as I know) Micheal Hampton and Blackbird play guitar on what tracks is another question. The other p-funk allstars show up all over (Belita woods and others). Surprisingly Sly Stone pops up on 5 tracks. The songs he is on are not the strongest (expect the Naz) they are interesting and show that Sly is still making music and hopefully he can put out a solo album soon. I personally think the album is a Funk fest, but is too long. If it was a 15 track album it could be tighter and more focused or even 20, but the meaning behind the 33 tracks is that it's George's answer to 33 long years of no funkadelic album (not counting by the way of the drum, the shelved funkadelic album for mca). The funkiest cuts to me are: F*cked Up, Ain't That Funkin Kinda Hard on You (uh huh like the book GC just wrote), The Naz (which is the story of Jesus told by Sly Stone), and In da Kar. EDIT: After listening to the album more I recommend theses fonky tracks as well Radiofriendly, Yesterdejavu, Nulear Dog (The b-side to The Naz basically part 2 without the rap), If I didn't love you, The wall, and Jolene. Some songs like Get Low have very modern beats and really don't sound like anything funkadelic ever, but with an album as deep in songs as Shake the Gate some weaker songs should be expected. To me the fact that Prince did a 2 album release and Funkadlic (Really more like Geroge Clinton) did a 3 album realse really blew my mind. Hopefully both will keep up the good work now I'm just waiting for the new RHCP album. Happy funkin!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"This album is solid to say its Meek Mill's first. He had built up quite some hype through his features on many artists songs. He had that \"it\" factor as an artist. \"Dream's and Nightmares\" the title track of the album was the perfect way to begin the album. The piano, which most likely whoever was playing used a sustain pedal, gives the sound of a waterfall. But when the beat switches midway through the song its like that dammed in waterfall explodes all over the place. What I love about it is Meek speeds up his pace and keeps with the beat. Many artists these days lack that simple quality. Certain artists' voices sound good with certain beats and horrible with others; this is Meek's shinning star. I have to say he keeps it consistent through the whole album by picking beats he sounds good on and shines just as much as the veteran artists featured on his songs such as \"Young & Gettin It\", \"Maybach Curtains\", \"Amen\", and \"Who Your Around\". To me each track fits his artist personality and voice while telling his story. This is the first album where I've seen a rap artist tell their story the way they wanted it told and not pressured to make a hit by the record company. You usually hear artists say on their first release\"it was ok\/great but I didn't get to make the kind of music I really wanted to put out\" Of course he has room from growth, I think any artist does. Give him time to me he gets better as he goes. Just look at his simple progress from streetdvd's & jail to where he is now. He's turned into an artist where you can recognize him the minute he opens his mouth and you expect to hear something heartfelt or what he knows.","classification":4,"fold":6}

GEORGE WAS BLESSED TO SEE THE LATER HIP HOP GENERATION AND HAVE HIS MUSIC SAMPLED AND ACTUALLY HE PIONEEDERD EVERY FORM OF HIP HOP SINCE SUGARHILL GANG.\nBUT THE BAd news is in the past 33 YEARS LOTS OF MEMBERS CAME AND WENT AND SOME ARE DECEASED WE FUNKFANS HAVE LOST GLEN GOINS, TIKI FULWOOD, PHILIPPE WYNNE, TYRONE LAMPKIN, EDDIE HAZEL, RAy davis, roger troutman, larry troutman, mallia franklin, catfish Collins, garry shider, boogie mosson, Jessica cleaves, harvee McGhee, kush Griffith, Vivian lewis, and belita woods. plus George has done many guesat appearances with rappers, rock, and funky folks ovewr the years still this triple cd is a must for funkadelic fans once you get used to the fact that the old days are gone but George and the newbies are still experimenting, George's grandson trazae steps up and George's sexy granddaughters kandy apple red pop up here too, sly stone does some stuff on here and his sexy daughter novena carmel, garry shider's son garrett replaces his dad but got to admit garrett doesn't sing like his dad, not too many rockers on here but yes blackbird McKnight, mike Hampton and rob monzoli from right said fred does some cool guitar riffas on here and yes the rapper scarface plays guitar on the track JOLENE. MY FAVORITE TUNE IS F'D UP A COOL JAzzfusion tunes aboput getting drunk and high and the tribute to Jessica cleaves a remake of bootsy's as in it sounds like this was recorde for her solo album back in the 80's and George had lily hayden overdub her violins anyway its a cool song and a proper farewell to the lovely miss cleaves you can hear her on knee deep, knee deep, new doo review and a few brides cuts on never buy texas. George also continues to experiment with differtent genres like alweays he does rap, techno, rock, jazz, and traditional party jams my only problem is that when George uses autotune  now now make no mistake George amplifying his voice back in the 70's was cool and hiom doing the sir nose characters while using autotune was the thing but now when George using autotune he sounds like t pain or future. but then again George influenced them anyweay but other than that the album is a must have for funkadelic fans heard theres gonna be another parliament ALBUM HOPEFULLY NEXT TIME IF THERES ANOTHER FUNKADELIC ALBUM IN MY LIFETIME THEY BRING THE GUITARS OUT SINCE THAT WAS FUNKADELIC WAS ALWAYS ABOUT GUITARS, BASS, DRUMS AND KEYS, ALSO NO BOOTSY ON HERE, BUT BERNIE WORRELL AND SKEET CURTIS POP UP HERE ALONG WITH DENNIS CHAMBERS.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"After four consecutive number one singles, what is a girl supposed to do? If you're Katy Perry, you go for broke and release what you hope to be a FIFTH number one from the same album, a feat unaccomplished since Michael Jackson's 'Bad'.\n\nLast Friday Night may not be the finest pop song upon first listen. It's fun, to be sure, but there's nothing particularly exceptional about it. 'E.T.' had it's stuttering bits paired with cold synths, 'Firework' had that soaring chorus, 'Teenage Dream' had Max Martin, which is all an artist really needs, and 'California Gurls' had, well, Snoop Dogg. That's enough about that.\n\nWell, Last Friday Night has a freaking saxophone. Yes, prior to Gaga's 'Edge of Glory', Katy was bringing the saxophone back on her own track. That, paired with the chanting and that darn hook make the 'epic fail' lyric not only forgivable but actually okay. This song could jump right out of an 80's movie, which the video exemplifies brilliantly.\n\nThis song may not have been a number one if not for the fact that it was released just as summer was kicking off, serving as the perfect anthem when no song had claimed the title quite yet. It may not have been number one if not for absolutely amazing video, which jettisoned the song from number 20 on iTunes to number 1. And it may not have been number one if not for that damn saxophone solo.\n\nBottom line: Katy has scored her THIRD song of the summer in two consecutive summers. Well done, Ms. Perry.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I always had this little thought in my mind that the title of this album referred somehow in the determination of the band itself,as being \"their really being good sports\" than something involving the sports bar imagery of the cover photography.\nIt didn't matter either way,if the early 80's really were Huey Lewis's chance a bat he took his team straight to many winning games musically. Commercially? Well any copy of Billboard magazine from around 1984 will tell you so. Yes this album was every bit the massive hit parade expected in pop in the time. And most albums of this type have been savaged in the rock press over the years as guilty. I wouldn't agree with that at all. But this album bypassed that. Pleasure for sure. Guilty no. A set of nine songs,made with great care and craft and a lot of good ear for clean production and you had yourself a big commercially and creatively successful hit.\n\n  The hits are are of course some of the most impressive moments here. My personal favorites are the driving dance-rock of \"Heart And Soul\" that warmly embraces it's post disco influences with a nice slick bassline as well as the thumping \"I Want A New Drug\". The retro doo wop of \"If This Is It\" is also wrapped up in the same sleek soul dressing. \"The Heart Of Rock N Roll\" is classic 80's rock all the way. I could've asked for the horns to be somewhat less timid sounding. On the other hand they were accessory elements to this kind of song. \"Walking On A Thin Line\" is a somewhat lesser known hit on the album with an even more bright and polished sound. \"Bad Is Bad\" gets the groove going on a little bit as well,with a mildly more defiant stance. \"Finally Found A Home\" and \"You Crack Me Up\" are pretty straight ahead mainstream guitar pop,again not too far from hit type songs whereas \"Honkey Tonk Blues\" showcases their classic R&B side by albums end.\n\n  Aside from a few minor things here this is an excellent rock and roll album. It doesn't pretend the soul and R&B roots of the music don't exist. In fact that's a point this album continues to make again and again,both musically and lyrically. Even though it's basically very contemporary,the flavor Huey Lewis evokes has a nostalgiac flavor to it. Again it might have something to do with the Reagan era attitude about the \"return to traditional American values\",which I guess referred to that of the late 50's\/early 60's veneer that this band seems to have embraced. On the other hand,there was a healthy dose of the new wave era attitude in them too which made for a vital hybrid of sound and intentions. This would be the end of their roll call of success by a long shot. But when most people think of Huey Lewis & The News,it's probably going to be one of the tunes from this album that will come to mind first.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Iron Maiden had just come off one of the most successful tours in Metal history with Powerslave.  The live album Live After Death is one of the greatest efforts ever recorded.  And then comes Somewhere In Time...  Here we have a band that is starting to feel comfortable with each other.  A band that has become successful and famous, a band that is going to start to play with their musical formula to make sure that they don't stagnate.  In come the guitar synths.  In come the larger-than-life tunes with grandiose production values.  In comes the hit single that is \"Wasted Years\" and Iron Maiden continue to grow in popularity, but at what cost?  If there is a line of demarcation where Iron Maiden begin to slip in the eyes of the true metal fans, it would be right after Piece Of Mind.  Powerslave was cool, but there were a few less than awesome tunes buried in the album's midsection.  Now we have Somewhere In Time, and the need to get a little more mainstream has become too great for the Maiden bunch to deny.  Is Somehwere a bad album?  Is it horrible?  Obviously not.  What it isn't is The Number Of The Beast.  It rocks, but on a lesser level.  There is definitely effort and cohesion on this Maiden outing, it's just that the signature sound is starting to wear a little thin in places.  Let's look at the track listing:\n\nCaught Somewhere In Time -  A rocking opener.  Filled with power and pulsing metal goodness.  There is energy here in this song that gives us hope for the following tracks.\n\nWasted Years - Great song.  Probably one of Maiden's more commercially successful tunes.  A personal favorite.  Reflective lyrics.  Great vibe.\n\nSea Of Madness - This song opens with a great barrage of slamming drums and wailing riffs.  Steve Harris is speaking with his bass and we hear it loud and clear.  Good tune.  Reminds me a bit of Flight Of Icarus.  Solid.\n\nHeaven Can Wait - Guitar synths are there but done tastefully.  This has an eerie intro that moves straight into the siganture Maiden sound and that detracts because the songs are starting to meld together.  Not as memorable as it should be.  Bruce can still wail, however, and that is great!\n\nThe Lonliness Of The Long Distance Runner - Uh...  Okay...  The title itself is comepletely un-metal and that made us as teenage headbangers flinch just a little bit.  Solid tune.  Bruce belts it out.  But, alas, sounds like regurgitated Maiden.  The riffs are so close to other songs that it doesn't make me like it a whole hell of a lot.  Solid, but far from great.\n\nStranger In A Strange Land - Ambitious.  Hear that heavy, larger-than-life sound.  Great bass riffs.  Elegant.  One of the better songs on the album.  Taking it down a bit, moody and cool.  I like it.\n\nDeja Vu - If you sat down and listened to all of the Iron Maiden albums up to this poit, one right after another, you would know that this has been done before on several levels.  Is Maiden repeating themselves?  Maybe.  It's just that they're good at playing a certain way and it's starting to become tedious.  This is a good song.  The lyrics are cool and Bruce delivers them with passion and precision, but it's not going to be your favorite Maiden tune of all time.  It's not!\n\nAlexander The Great - As with Rime Of The Ancient Mariner and To Tame A Land, Maiden saves the ponderous song for last.  It's a good song, not their best, but I happen to have a soft spot for it.  This let's us know that Maiden are historically correct and that they are still thinking man's metal.  It just drags slightly.  That's all.\n\nOverall, Somewhere In Time has a large sound filled with driving riffs and slamming drums and wailing Dickinson lyrics.  It means well.  It sounds pretty good.  It just sounds a little reheated after Piece Of Mind and Powerslave.  Could that Maiden signature sound be wearing out? Not necessarily, but some of the songs lack that crucial hook that makes any song great and memorable.  From this point forward, the Maiden boys would start their eventual decline.\n\nDig it!","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Cincinnati-based Walk the Moon self-released an enticing album late 2010 called \"i want! i want!\", which created some buzz, primirily due to the can't miss-must see video that went viral for the band's break-out song \"Anna Sun\". It didn't take long for major labels to come knocking at the door, and the band ultimately signed with RCA. Now finallly comes the band's major label-debut album.\n\n\"Walk the Moon\" (11 tracks; 43 min.) starts off with several re-recorded songs from its self-released album with \"Quesadilla\" and \"Lisa Baby\", the latter being a a prime example of what makes Walk the Moon such an enjoyable band: smart guitar hooks, heavy drums-and-bass, plus a can't miss sing-along beat. \"Next in Line\" is the first of 5 brand new songs on here (the older songs are rerecorded with the current line-up, of which lead singer Nicolas Petricca os the only remaining original member). Then comes the band's signature song \"Anna Sun\", which by now sounds so throroughly familiar, yet still feels fresh. Other standouts among the new songs are \"Tightrope\" and, even better, \"Shiver Shiver\", which Petrucci singing falsetto but the underlying grooves are just massive and fun. The only surprise on here for me would be \"Iscariot\", not one of the band's better songs and feeling out of place due to slow\/pensive (instead I woud've included \"Me + All My Friends\" or \"The Liftaway\"). \"Fixin'\" is another great new song. Things finish up with the now-classic \"I Can Lift a Car\", which also is a perfect summary of the band in one song.\n\nIn all, this is a boisterous and fun album, with hardly a weak moment in it. But to get the full Walk the Moon experience, you need to see these guys in concert. I've seen them a bunch of times in and around CIncinnati in the last 18 months, and a good time is always guaranteed. Do not miss them if you have a chance to catch these guys live!

{"text":"I like Emmylou Harris & Rodney Crowell's voice together on this duet album \"Old Yellow Moon\", they complimented eachother very well. You can tell from the first track \"Hanging Up My Heart\" on the album they still have the chemistry from since when Crowell joined harris's ,  Hot Band in 1975. He used to be the rhythm guitarist and back up vocalist in Harris band. After he left the band, he still contributed songs on Harris albums. I think the two of them coming together to do an album was pure genius. It was nice to see the Hot Band members, Jmes Burtons, John Ware, and Bill Payne making an appearances  on the album, along with other country greats like Vince Gill and Stuart Duncan. Some songs on the album are orginals and some  were previously recorded by other people, but Harris & Crowell did every song on the album justice. I love how  piano led this lovely mid tempo song \"opening Season On My Heart\" and another fan favorite will be \"Bull Rider\", which the fiddle is of the hook. The two songs that spoke to me most were \"Old Yellow Moon\" and \"Black Caffeine, I felt them in my bones.  I'm certaining this album will be a huge hit on the billboard charts. The album is a mix of honky tonk, old school country, a little retro rock, and a little bit of vintage country. Crowell wrote four songs on the album which are \"Season On My Heart\", \"Bull Rider\", \"Here We Are\" and \"Bluebird Wine\".\n\nAll 12 songs on the album are worth listening to, and  I'm sure you would  play them over and over. These two can really sing , their tenor and soprano voices really complimented eachother, and you can tell they had fun working with eachother on this album. So glad to see old country music with talented singers are back in the forfront getting the attention it deserved. These are two talented people that let their vocal speaks for them. I love love this album and I know it will soon become my new fav that I listen to all the time.\n\nOverall Harris & Cowell created a terrific duet album, that never get bogged down  in the same tone and delivered some stunning ballards. I'm happy that two old country favorites came together and recorded some quailty music. I recommend this album for anybody who wants to listen to some great country music.","classification":5,"fold":6}

I'm so out of shape from listening to the dreary, drab, dribbling, life draining, hum drum that is usually posted in the \"music from rising artists\" section that I have forgotten what it is like to have an essential lung full of air administered by a shot of testosterone driven pyrotechnic talent.  I deduct one star and want to punch the producer in the mouth for not initiating a mind melting guitar solo at about the 3:29 mark just before the oo-rah chanting.

{"text":"More than a few times, the music on this record has smacked me upside the head after only a few listens. Although such a statement will make others bypass this review, believing there is some overhype associated with this music, and understandably so, the key to why this record is so good is because it hits that way, in all the right places, without seeming like it will. It doesn't go for the ears, it goes for the heart and mind.\n\nDeftones guitarist Steph Carpenter was presumably upset in a notorious interview recently because he couldn't play on, or contribute to, a \"metal album\". No shame, Steph. You've helped create something much, much more. This is no ordinary record: all hype is justified.\n\nI didn't think I'd ever see the likes of pondering, hefty albums like Catherine Wheel's acerbic \"Chrome\", Talk Talk's unnerving and pastoral \"Laughing Stock\", Shudder to Think's pre-artsy effervescent \"Get Your Goat\", or the angular, pounding structures of Hum's overlooked epic \"Downward is Heavenward\" again. Deftones have taken the blueprint for those classic works and created something unexpected, a rock album for an era without rock or albums. Long after the stereotype of something like \"shoegaze\" subsided, those records endured; the same will happen here. You can instantly tell \"Gore\" will have that staying power.\n\nIndividual highlights add up to a cohesive whole. Opener \"Prayers\/Triangles\" pleads until it climaxes in a thrall of panic. \"Acid Hologram\" features some nifty engineering resulting in an unexpected new Deftones landscape. \"Doomed User\" barges in immediately, its revolving riffage leading into a well of dissonant noise. The next few tracks demand much of your attention, but reward with soaring courses and hooks that would make Craig Wedren blush.\n\nAbout midway through, the album begins to cohere around a theme: squalls of crunching guitars envelop outrageously addictive melody, and the emotion begins to build. Just exactly what the profoundly melodic chorus and lyrics of \"Xenon\" are all about, or the message of its mysterious and phenomenal follow up \"(L)MIRL\", is unclear. With momentum, the record offers the downlifting title track, a ballad for the ages in \"Phantom Bride\", and a truly (as often as this word is unnecessarily dispensed) awesome closer in \"Rubicon\". Awesome, as in \"inspiring awe\". As in, this record finishes with a sequence of songs that merits attention, contemplation, and realization that even in an age devoid of rock & roll albums as we used to know them, there is still a place for music like this, that place in the center of your chest, where good music always hits.

{"text":"With the soundtrack for \"Gone Girl\", Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have produced a fine album.  It's their third collaboration with director David Fincher - in my opinion this score is not quite as good as \"The Social Network\" but is better than \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\".\n\nIt's a soundtrack that fits the film's suspense perfectly.  The music helps to build tension; that is its primary function.  But the score works well as an isolated listening experience as well (depending on your mood), in part because of its uniqueness\/originality.  In fact, I would say that the soundtrack is as weird as the film itself - it's music that would only work for this one movie.\n\nRecommended if you enjoyed the movie or if you were a fan of the previous efforts of Reznor\/Ross.\n\nFAVORITE TRACKS\n[1] What Have We Done to Each Other?\n[14] The Way He Looks at Me\n[15] Technically, Missing","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"It has been a while since I have heard some new music that was actually good, but this album definitely has changed that. Every song gets my approval and thumbs up. Some are particularly catchy and end up getting stuck in my head like Underdog, but not in a way that is annoying. Imagine Dragons has a new fan. Amsterdam has a Coldplay vibe to it, especially at the beginning. The album's leading singles, It's Time and Radioactive are also great. It is rare for me to actually like a song from a new or previously unheard of artist on the radio but those songs are great! Radioactive was the song that really got me hooked on their music. I also really like the message in Demons. Lastly, I'd like to give a shout out to On Top of The World because it is also very catchy and has a very happy vibe to it, almost reminding me of Simba's \"I Just Can't Wait to be King\" on the Lion King movie.

Not long before, in 1995 she released GREATEST HITS, but this offers a more comprehensive collection of her songs, from that album, and from the hits that came after that. As well there are 5 new songs worth raving about. Starting with the tongue-in-cheek \"Whoop-de-do\", a song with plenty of attitude, its a fun song and nice to see this side of Lorrie. Then there is the beautiful, love and devotion ballad \"To Get To You\" which Lorrie just masters with her impecable vocals. \"If I Cry\" is another power ballad, and could have been a big hit if given a chance. She also covers the Sarah McLaughlan song \"Angel\", and gives her own magic to this touching song. Perhaps one of the most talked about tracks is the Tammy Wynette cover of \"Another Lonely Song\", which Lorrie does justice to very well! Also includes her hits such as \"Good As I Was To You\", \"One Of Those Nights Tonight\", \"Go Away\", \"Something In Red\", \"Maybe Not Tonight\" With Sammy Kershaw, and plenty of others.

{"text":"Born This Way, both song and album, have been hyped so much that there was no way for the song to live up to the standard that had already been set. Months later, though, once the bit of disappointment has worn away, it becomes apparent what a landmark this is for both pop music and our culture in general. How one feels about this track will likely hinge on how one feels about gay rights, as that is simply an unavoidable aspect of the single. To view this as simply a song isn't enough. What Lady Gaga has done here is create a pop song that promotes not only gay rights, but also faith in God within those rights. Never before has an artist said, \"Look, being gay is awesome, and God is awesome, so why deny yourself either one? Love who you are, because God sure does.\" People can ramble about the 'Express Yourself' comparisons all day long, and they are well-founded. However, this goes far beyond sonic components and basic song structure. 'Born This Way' spent six weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100, and did so without compromising anything. This is a landmark moment in our society, when we realize that the public might just be on the track to embracing homosexuality, as well as believing that maybe God embraces it as well. For that, all else pales in comparison.","classification":5,"fold":6}

The song is basically wanting the life of a Rockstar, which Nickelback is, so... not the most original theme. In fact, this song is more cliched than a international South Park cartoon character. But, what makes the song is the catchiness. You'll have it stuck in your head whether you like it or not, and soon, in the middle of a crowded elevator, you'll start singing, \"I'm going to pop my pills with a pez dispenser.\" This may of course cause you much embarrassment, and will cause you to smash your radio. But in the end, it's a rock song, and Nickelback's best rock song, and maybe best song period. I'm not saying it's a great song, just Nickelback's best song, because it's so darn catchy.\n\nOverall, there are many warnings to give before getting this song, and they are too numerous to name here.

{"text":"\"Gold and Green\" dishes up nothing but outstanding music from Sugarland! They sound better than ever on this album; and the arrangements for their holiday songs are highly creative and beautiful. Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush can write--and on this album they perform holiday songs both traditional and new. Listen for songs that have widespread appeal with lyrics about family, love and so much more of life. The CD also gets a lot of its strength from the way the tracks flow into one another; and that's grand. Sugarland sounds just great and the artwork is very pretty. This is definitely a must-have for their fans!\n\n\"City of Silver Dreams\" - This is a beautiful, poignant song with an elegant piano arrangement. It makes a great starter tune for the album. And wow, how Jennifer Nettles can SING!\n\n\"Winter Wonderland\" - Obviously, this is a traditional song; but Sugarland performs it with so much exceptional energy they can practically claim it as their own. That awesome country flavor works wonders for this classic ballad and they never miss a beat. The guitars sound particularly sweet; this'll get you up and dancing!\n\n\"Holly Jolly Christmas\" - This has more excellent words and music performed with a country twist by talented Sugarland. The guitars are just terrific and the slightly slower than normal tempo lets them put their own stamp on this song.\n\n\"Coming Home\" - This stuns me with its beauty; Sugarland delivers this with heart and soul--and just one listen proves it! The music fits in perfectly with those vocals, too.\n\n\"Gold and Green\" - The title track gets a lovely treatment; this handsome song is very easy on the ear and I think you're going to like this charming lullaby.\n\n\"Maybe Baby (New Year's Day)\" - Sugarland uses percussion, guitars and more to make this song sparkle brightly. This song is very beautiful indeed; and it deals with the topic of a man remembering a love affair. This is clearly a major highlight of this album.\n\n\"Nuttin' for Christmas\" - \"Nuttin' for Christmas\" is a cute, secular Christmas song that Sugarland aces as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing. It really wasn't all that easy; their talents carry them through.\n\n\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\" - This is a lovely interpretation of this classic Christmas song.\n\n\"Little Wood Guitar\" - This is a new song by Sugarland. What a great song this is--we hear the story of a little girl who received a guitar as her only Christmas present. Sugarland bats this right out of the ballpark.\n\n\"Silent Night\" - Sugarland ends their album with a crackerjack interpretation of this classic and ageless Christmas music. Kristian Bush and Jennifer Nettles sing this in both English and Spanish; and they never let go of a single superfluous note!\n\nSugarland delivers an awesome holiday CD. I recommend this for Sugarland fans; and people who want a terrific country style holiday CD would do well to add this to their collections.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"After spending almost a year at the penthouse position of the Billboard Christian Songs tally with their uber hit \"Oceans (Where Feet May Fail),\" looks like UNITED's empire is not ready to topple.  Rather than reinventing the wheel, UNITED has utilized the same mortar and brick that made \"Oceans\" such a monumental hit to erected \"Touch the Sky.\"  Again finding Taya Smith on lead vocals, \"Touch the Sky\" is another crescendo building ballad, but this time with a slighly more accentuated beat relative to the ethereal and sparse feel of \"Oceans.\"\n\nPart of the glowing affinity many find with \"Oceans\" is its haunting ability to brings us right into the shores of the Sea of Galilee as Jesus challenges Peter to walk on water.  That immediacy of hearing the crash of the waves, the coarseness of the sand in our feet, and the burgeoning realm of darkness as the sun was setting all were gloriously brought to life with a 3-D realism in just that one song.\n\nSimilarly, \"Touch the Sky\" has that holographic sensation.  As the first note strikes you find yourself situated in heaven.  Glittering in our horizons are the usurpassing richness of God's eternal promises.  You can feel your heart beating and your soul pulsating with desire. Then comes the denoucement of the song, such glorious riches can only be ours not by good works or constant striving.  But they can be ours when we are prepared to bend the knee to Jesus, deny ourselves, carry up His cross and suffer for His Gospel.\n\nSelf-denial has never been more eloquently portrayed than in these words: \"My heart beating, my soul breathing\/I found my life when I laid it down\/Upward falling, spirit soaring\/I touch the sky when my knees hit the ground.\"  Add to that Smith's melliflous vocals, no wonder empires shattered in the face of Christ's kingdom.

{"text":"Well, here I am.  I never thought I'd be reviewing a Kesha album.  I was one of those people who used to deride pop music as \"poor quality fodder for the weak masses\" when I was younger, but I have since become more diverse and eclectic in my musical tastes over time.  Still, I never thought I would have grown fond of Kesha, of all people - one of the most disliked and disrespected pop artists out there, often held out as a shining example of the degradation of quality present in modern music.  Still, I find myself strangely attracted to her music, and I truly love this album.  I'm now going to go through each song individually, and give a brief explanation of my feelings on them.\n\n\"Your Love Is My Drug\" (5\/5) - Though the metaphor of comparing the rush of love to feeling of drug-induced highs is hardly an original concept, this is still a nice song.  The lyrics aren't particularly inspired or insightful, but the beat and chorus are infectious enough to keep one entertained for the duration of the song.\n\n\"Tik Tok\" (5\/5) - This is arguably Kesha's most well-known song, and it's a good one.  I know many point to this song as merely an example of poor lyricism over a catchy electronic beat, but I honestly like this song.  The feel of the song is very energetic, and the lyrics accurately capture the feeling of pure, unfettered freedom from societal constraints.  You truly get the sense that the narrating character  of the song (an idealized version of Kesha herself, perhaps) really and honestly does not give a f*** whether or not using \"a bottle of Jack\" as a dental hygiene tool is within acceptable cultural norms.  I especially love this song because the listener of the song gets to vicariously enjoy the feeling of energetic, reckless freedom the song portrays, but without the inherent dangers realistically living such a lifestyle would actually entail.  Also, it does make me wonder what it feels like to be P. Diddy...\n\n\"Take It Off\" (5\/5) - If \"Tik Tok\" merely touched upon the heady delight of hedonistic freedom, this song exemplifies it to a much greater degree.  The lyrics paint an image of chaotic, unbridled, almost animalistic pleasures taking place - even though the location may not be the most glamorous.  Indeed, the venue is described as \"dirty\" and a \"hole in the wall,\" foreshadowing future songs that showcase a disdain for upper class aesthetics.  The heavy autotune is used here as well, not as a crutch for a poor singer, but more as a full-blown vocal effect (as with much of her music) and I find it quite enjoyable.  This song always fills me with energy!\n\n\"Kiss N Tell\" (4\/5) - This really isn't one of my favorite Kesha songs.  It's not a very interesting song lyrically, but it's musically catchy enough to keep me entertained.\n\n\"Stephen\" (4\/5) - This also isn't one of my preferred songs.  I can't quite tell if it's meant to be taken seriously or not, but I suspect it's a joke song.  The song is catchy and listenable for the most part, but the parts where Kesha effects an odd tone of voice (almost like a failed attempt at an accent) do grate upon my nerves a bit.  Thankfully, it's a really short part, and the song ends before it outstays its welcome.\n\n\"Blah Blah Blah ft. 3OH\" (5\/5) - I know a lot of people dislike the chorus on this song, and I can understand why.  Listening to the words \"blah blah blah\" over and over again could be annoying, but in my opinion the song goes just far enough without being overbearing about it.  The music is catchy as you'd expect, but also lyrically somewhat interesting.  The song features one of Kesha's many sexual pursuits and portrays an image of a woman with powerful, dominant sexual urges and does so without an ounce of guilt or shame, which is (along with other songs of hers on the same subject matter) where much of Kesha's reputation for \"sluttiness\" comes from.  I, however, applaud this view of strong female sexuality unburdened by gendered double-standards (and honestly, if a similar song as this had been sung by a male rapper, for example, no one would have batted an eye, which exactly proves my point).  I have heard the original unofficial version and the one on the album that includes 3OH!3.  They don't add a whole lot in my opinion, but don't really hurt the song either, so either version is worth listening to.\n\n\"Hungover\" (5\/5) - This is one of my favorite songs off of the album because it is the very first song on the album that showcases Kesha's softer side.  This song could be interpreted as a simple song about missing a love interest who has left after a brief fling at a party, but I see deeper meaning in it.  After several tracks celebrating the bright, fiery energy of unrestrained hedonism, this song is a rather poignant counterpoint to the joys of such a lifestyle.  To me, this track represents the darker aspects of a life of constant indulgence.  First off, the title itself, \"Hungover,\" illustrates this since a hangover is technically the unpleasant consequence of the fun of being drunk previously.  Not only is this song just about the more tangible pains such as regretting a lost love interest, or the feelings of loneliness after a party, but it also perfectly captures a hollow feeling of almost existential emptiness.  The inevitable consequence after the hedonistic high is the unpleasant crash - leaving the narrator with the uncomfortable, disquieting question of \"what went wrong?\"\n\n\"Party At a Rich Dude's House\" (5\/5) - After a song as meaningful as \"Hungover,\" hearing this song next almost gives me whiplash.  This is about as light-hearted as one can get.  The lyrics match the title, as this is just a fun song about a party at a \"rich dude's house\".  Kesha, as usual, shows her irreverent disdain for the trappings of wealth.  The song does feel a bit jarring after \"Hungover\" but it could be seen as an attempt to lighten the mood for the listener after such a heavy song, and it IS fun to listen to (especially that bit about throwing up in the closet), so I can't complain.\n\n\"Backstabber\" (4\/5) - This is another song that's not really one of my favorites.  It's just okay.  The chorus is just a bit too repetitive for my tastes, and the lyrical content isn't particularly interesting.  Still, it's a decent enough song, and it doesn't last longer than it should.\n\n\"Blind\" (5\/5) - This is one of the songs that I really like.  It is just a very straight forward song about a breakup, but the driving beat and strong chorus keep it catchy and enjoyable to listen to.\n\n\"Dinosaur\" (5\/5) - This is purely a joke song meant to amuse.  To that end, it succeeds.  The lyrics are humorous enough and I do enjoy the bit of word play involved with spelling out the word dinosaur and having the last two letters made up by the words \"you are\" (and no, I didn't pick up on that the very first time I listened to this song - clearly, I am an idiot).  Anyway, \"Dinosaur\" is a very fun and light-hearted song that always makes me crack a smile.\n\n\"Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\" (5\/5) - This is another more downbeat song.  Unlike \"Hungover\" this one doesn't stir feelings of existential angst - this is a much more straight forward song about a lost love due to breakup (I assume).  Unlike \"Blind\" where the tone was more one of defiant indignation, this song is clearly about sadness and heartbreak.  It's a lovely song, and I enjoy it.\n\n\"Boots and Boys\" (3\/5) - Sadly, it seems like a great many albums have that one not-so-good song that serves as the filler song.  It's a song that's dull, uninteresting, and put on the album solely to take up space - and this is that song.  The chorus is just too repetitive for my liking and the lyrics are really boring after all the stronger songs on the album.  The only thing that keeps it from a lower score is the fact that it isn't so terrible as to be totally unlistenable.  Still, as far as filler songs go, while this could have been cut or replaced with something better, it's really not as bad as it could have been.  Frankly, we're lucky that it's the only filler song on the album.\n\n\"Animal\" (5\/5) - This is a great standout song on this album.  It really speaks to the idea of \"living in the moment\" as it details the story of of someone who desperately wants to cling to their relationship just as it is, but knows that this goal is somehow futile.  We never really learn why this is an unattainable goal, but the intensity of that desperate yearning is there nevertheless.  This is truly a beautiful song.\n\n\"VIP\" (5\/5) - This is a bonus track that comes on the Animal + Cannibal Deluxe Edition.  It's definitely one of my favorites.  It's got an absolutely swinging beat, a catchy chorus, and some interesting lyrics, to boot.  The song details Kesha's disdain for the elitist VIP culture, and is definitely worth a listen.\n\n\"Dirty Picture Pt. 2\" (5\/5) - This is the second bonus song from the Deluxe version, and I really like it too.  It's a rather sexually charged song (that's about the exact thing the title says) with a catchy chorus and it always gets me pumped!  You'll notice the \"Pt. 2\" in the title.  There is actually an original, alternate version of this song that doesn't feature Taoi Cruz.  I've listened to it and I honestly feel this version is the better one - he definitely adds the song and makes it sound better.\n\nOverall Score (5\/5): NOTE this score is not a mathematical average of previous scores; it's my subjective overall score.  Even though every single song on this album is not an instant knock-out, I still feel like most of them are good enough to really make this album equal more than the sum of its parts.  It's a fun and enjoyable album and it really puts me in a good mood, and the variety of songs help paint a picture of Kesha as a complex person - possessing both a wild partying side and a softer side.  Overall, it's a great first release.  Note that I did indeed buy the Deluxe 2 Disc version with the Cannibal EP included, but this review is long enough as it is, so I'm going to review that EP separately under its own separate amazon listing.  Go check that out if it interests you.  As for this set, however, I do strongly suggest you buy the 2 Disc Deluxe version if you don't already own Animal or Cannibal by themselves.  You can save a bit of money that way (and get the excellent bonus tracks), and both are definitely worth having.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Peter Frampton, Englishman, gave a gift to young America to help them celebrate and enjoy the red white and blue bicentennial summer. Frampton Comes Alive! was a massive commercial success, staying at the top of the charts for 10 weeks. It was THE album of 1976.\n\nDo You Feel Like We Do is the final and longest track on the double live album. There is a momentary pause, the crowd waiting, then Frampton starts playing the classic opening riff. The rest of the band come in, bass, keyboards and drums.\n\nTo the audience, Frampton and his mates can do no wrong. It's like the crowd already know and love the album, even though it didn't exist yet. Maybe there were flashing CHEER and APPLAUSE signs? Perhaps they all owned and loved his studio album, Frampton's Camel? Nah, face it, Frampton was ON and he had them in the palm of his hand. It's great fun 70s rock, it sounds excellent, how could anyone not be having a blast at this show? Of course they feel like you do, Peter. You're the Pied Piper, Peter Piper.\n\nAfter the first couple of verses, Frampton plays a tasty little lick at 2:10, then kicks out a fantastic solo from 2:21-3:01. Following another verse and chorus, at 3:52 the music slides into a quiet middle section, featuring\n\nBob Mayo...on the keyboards, Bob Mayo, who plays a groovy solo from 4:12-5:17. Frampton starts asking the crowd, Do You Feel Like We Do...and, yes, I think they do. He solos again from 5:55-7:00.\n\nThen, wait...what's going on? I can't see what's happening on stage. The band are playing along together, the crowd is cheering. Peter must be mucking around with something. Oh right, he's getting his talk box effect thingamajig ready. It appears at 7:22, oo baydo baydo boo...crowd cheer...bah do wah bo baba dah...crowd cheer...Peter you sound funny, I wanna thank you...I hope you have a good night...don't forget to come again real real soon (not sure about this last part). Some of it must just be Frampton going wah wahwah woo wow uh.\n\nAt 11:25, Frampton ditches the talk box with a big Woahwoww...then pulls out all the stops for one more mighty solo at 11:45 that lasts until the end, sending the crowd into spasms of joy.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"The 2001 album Ten New Songs is quite subdued and at first listen all the songs have the same slow gentle sound. But the old magic' emerges on classics like In My Secret Life, Love Itself, The Land of Plenty and the elegant Alexandra Leaving. Cohen covers familiar themes and one even recognizes lines from earlier songs, e.g. \"I do what I am told,\" (That Don't Make It Junk), while the mood of The Land Of Plenty reminds me of Heart With No Companion from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Various-Positions\/dp\/B0012GMW7A\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Various Positions<\/a>&nbsp;album, a devotional filled with resignation and acceptance.\n\nBy The Rivers Dark refers to Psalm 137 about remembering Zion and singing a song to the Lord by the rivers of Babylon.

{"text":"If I did not love Kansas so much during my teenage years, this probably would not be in my collection.  This song, which first appeared on the album \"Vinyl Confessions\" marks the end of my teenage rock years, just before I got into the newer rock of the 80s dominated by such bands as the Police, U2, INXS and REM.\n\nIt is difficult to recommend this song on its merits.  As with most Kansas songs, the musicianship is good to excellent, but the songwriting itself is uninspiring.\n\nIf you like the progressive\/art rock sound this song won't offend you.  Unless you're flush with cash and want the entire history of late 1970s and early 1980s rock, skip over this one.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"When you watch those in a descending roller coaster screaming off the top of their heads, it's easy to snicker and sneer, \"O ye of little faith.\"  But it's quite another story if you are one of those on the roller coaster.  It is one thing to read the unemployment statistic on a government bureaucratic report, but it's quite another if you are one of those numbers.  It is one thing to hear about Aunt May going for chemotherapy treatment from the church prayer letter, but it's quite another when chemotherapy is part of your to do list in your diary for next Tuesday.  And it's definitely one thing to sing the stories of others who have struggled, but it's quite another when it's a song that details a narrative you are going through.  For years since her 1999 Curb Records debut, Natalie Grant has been singing the stories of people who have suffered.  Who can forget the woman in her hit song \"Held\" who had to struggle with her baby who just died?  Or the sister who is at brink of breakdown only to find hope in God's \"Better Hands\"?  However, when it comes to her 9th studio album \"Hurricane,\" Grant doesn't just sing about other people's stories.  Rather, co-penning 8 out of the 10 songs, now she sings about her own stories.\n\nBased on her own real-life experiences, Grant voiced, for the first time, her struggles with post-partum depression after the birth of her third child.  On these 10 newly recorded songs helmed by her husband Bernie Helms, chronicles her struggles: her feelings of inadequacy when it comes to parenting; her feelings of guilt over the ceaseless balance of work, family, motherhood and faith. The lead single and title track \"Hurricane\" puts to description some of the whirlwinds she went through over the last few years.  Anyone has had a bout with depression will resonate with lines like: \"You're spinning out of control again\/Your life feels like a sinking ship\/You're wondering how it came to this\/Is it too late?\/Is it too far?\/For Him to reach you\/And come to where you are.\" Yet, Grant does not leave us high and dry to be overwhelmed by the hurricane of trials.  Rather, with her patented fervor she urges us to call upon God who finds us in our hurricanes.  Inspired by 1 Kings 19:12-13 where God ministers to a discouraged prophet Elijah, the hook-laden pop shuffle \"Whisper\" reminds us that sometimes God's comfort is at the loudest when He whispers.\n\nFans who have loved Grant's huge dramatic ballads \"Held\" and \"Greatness of Our God\" will once again be awed by \"Burn Bright.\"  In times when we begin to dwindle into self-doubt and discouragement, this piano ballad is a lift to the heart as Grant reminds us that God has made us for more.  In a similar trajectory is \"Born to Be.\"  Co-written by Bernie Helms, Grant and Brett James (Luke Bryan & Kenny Chesney), \"Born to Be\" finds Grant joining voices with Rascal Flatt's Gary LeVox in a gorgeous ode of celebration of our identity we have in Christ Jesus.  If the country music connection is hinted at on \"Born to Be,\" \"In the End\" is a rootsy bluegrassy banjo romp that finds Grant going back to her southern roots.  \"In the End\" has an apocalyptic focus where Grant reminds that though we may not understand the reasons behind our sufferings but one day at our Master's return all our queries will be resolved.\n\nWith the recent arrival of her third child, Grant shares with us her maternal heart with the lullaby-like \"When I Leave the Room.\"  With fellow artist Nicole Nordeman, Grant and her hubby Bernie Helms have created one of the most touching prayers a parent can pray for his or her child when we hand over our children in utter surrender to the hands of Jesus.  Listening to these 10 tracks is never a mechanical chore.  As each track flows one into another, regardless of the tempo, we are engaged in the intricacies of the emotions of each song.  One of the reasons why these emotions are so raw, so palatable and so engaging is because they come from a woman who has had firsthand experience of what it means to call upon God in her hurricanes.  And now through these songs she testifies unashamedly of His greatness and love.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Major Harris releases his debut album My Way in 1974-75.  He has a cool vibin' voice and flows easy over the melody: no wonder why the Delfonics had him join them in the early 70's after Randy Cain (R.I.P.) left.  Here, he gets some solo shine and makes a wonderful record with different tempos and styles.  The hit single: \"Love Won't Let Me Wait\"  is a cool-vibin, jazzy, classy number, with some orgasmic girl moans at the end of the slow drag.  \"Sideshow\" is a mellow cover of a Blue Magic classic jam, and Major Harris handles it well.  Other slower jams include \"Just a Thing I Do\" and \"My Way.\"  The other songs are more up-tempo and also are spirit and soul up-lifters.  \"Sweet Tomorrow\" is gorgeous, poetic, and romantic.  The swinging vibe of \"Loving You Is Mellow\" with the heavenly chorus chants is another mood lifter.  All the songs on My Way are great: Major Harris has a great voice.  Anyone who loves anything from Motown to Philly Soul and even softer Disco will love this wonderful album.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Like to see him hook up with Steve Arrington too. Back to these cuts.\"Roller  Rink\" and \"As in\" are two of my favorites here. Their version of \"Bernadette\" which is an old Four Tops original, sounds mighty refreshing, new and groovy here. Among other songs. Sly's \"The Naz\" is among my favorites on disc #3.

{"text":"Whoa!!!!! Where did this come from? Without any hype or media attention, Sony has just released \"The Essential Michael Jackson\" (37 tracks, 157 min.), perhaps the ultimate Michael Jackson compilation.\n\nCD 1 (20 tracks, 79 min.) cover the period up to and including the \"Thriller\" album, starting with the best known Jackson 5 singles such as \"ABC\" and \"I Want You Back\", then shifting to the Jacksons. It would have been better to include \"State of Shock\" or \"Lovely One\" instead of \"Enjoy Yourself\". CD1 finishes off with 7 of the 9 \"Thriller\" album tracks (the other 2 being \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\"; it's still hard to believe how successfull that album really was, and how many hits were relased from it, in the days when \"radio tracks\" meant actual vinyl single releases). This was of course Michael at his absolute best, now 23 years ago.\n\nCD2 (17 tracks, 78 min.) compiles 8 tracks from \"Bad\" and 7 from \"Dangerous\", and finishes off with \"You Are Not Alone\" from HIStory and \"You Rock My World\" from Invincible. In other words: only 2 tunes from the post-1992 era, and rightfully so, even though the HIStory and Invincible albums are not nearly as bad or mediocre as many would like you to believe. The only track that arguably should be on here (but, at 78 min. already, at the expense of what other track then?) is \"Scream\", the No. 1 duet with sister Janet.\n\nIn the end, this \"essential\" compilation is better than any other compilation available (HIStory Vol. 1; Number Ones, etc.) as it covers both the Jackson 5\/Jacksons era and his solo output. It's very strange to me that this was released without any hype or advertizing campaign, but the main thing is that it's out and available. Hihgly recommended!","classification":5,"fold":6}

There is a nice transition around 3.20 and it comes back strong.\n\nI do enjoy the lyrics such as:  \"I've been going through life...Making foolish plans...Now my world is in your hands.\" And, \"There's mystery in this wood...And ghosts within these roots...That are tangled deep beneath this southern ground.\"\n\nCan't wait until my pre-order lets me actually download it.

{"text":"\"Keepsakes in the Attic\" is the sixth solo piano album from composer\/ pianist\/ arranger\/clinical psychologist\/ professor \/ researcher\/ hang glider\/ 21st century Renaissance Man (whew!) Jeff Bjorck. This is the first album that Bjorck has released that doesnt begin and end with favorite hymns, but Bjorcks love of hymns often carries over and influences his original music, as it does with several of the thirteen tracks on this album. Twelve of the pieces are original compositions and one is Bjorcks arrangement of an old Swedish hymn, Tryggare Kan Ingen Vara (Children of the Heavenly Father) that reminds him of his early years. Bjorcks concept for the album was the idea of spending an afternoon in the attic of an old house, rummaging through various keepsakes belonging to you or your loved ones and the emotions that those discoveries and memories evoke. This idea is also the perfect framework for Bjorcks love for iconic turn-of-the-20th-century melodic structures and the range of emotions they express. It is also interesting to note that the keepsakes pictured in the album artwork are actual heirlooms from Bjorcks family, making this album deeply personal yet universally relatable.\n\n\"Keepsakes in the Attic\" begins with Afternoon Reverie, setting the nostalgic tone of the album with bittersweet grace and elegance. Returning Home recalls times driving long distances back to Bjorcks hometown to visit his parents and the homesick feelings he experienced as he revisited familiar places along the way - feelings that were immediately cured as soon as he walked through the front door. Grandads Rocker affectionately recalls an old rocking chair and the person who occupied it before it came to his own family - ah, the tales a chair like that could tell! Hearts Far Apart was inspired by Bjorcks own yearning for his wife when they are far apart. With tangible musical expression of deep love, this is an especially moving tribute. Grooms First Waltz is much lighter and happier, reminding me in places of my favorite hymn, In the Garden. It begins tentatively, imagining a young groom unaccustomed to dancing, and becomes more confident and flowing as he relaxes and enjoys the dance with his new bride - a sweet and delightful piece! Hope in the Heartache is something of a sequel to Bjorcks 1991 composition, Waiting For Farewell, composed during the last weeks of his fathers life. With the recent loss of one of his closest friends, this newer piece is dedicated to his memory and to the hope of seeing him (and his father) again one day. The lighter tone of the closing section reflects on that hope. Playing Catch with Dad happily recalls a favorite childhood pastime and time spent with a beloved father. Justine of County Clare feels like an older hymn and recalls stories Bjorcks mother told him about his grandmother, who died two years before he was born. Nanas Music Box ends this beautiful album with an imaginary keepsake, an antique music box that a loving grandmother would allow her small grandchildren to play when they visited her. Played in the upper registers of the piano, this gentle little piece gradually trails off at the end, suggesting that the lid of the music box has been left open so the echoes and memories can continue on in the listeners heart.\n\nI have enjoyed all of Jeff Bjorcks albums, but I think this is his best and most personal album yet. Very highly recommended!","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Using a hook singer to push a single is nothing new in the hip hop genre, some time the results are successful, such  as the classic Ghostface Killah & Carl Thomas song Never Be The Same of disastrous  the Lloyd Banks & Musiq Soulchild track Addicted from Bank's second album . Last spring  rising hip hop artist  B.O.B. had a smash hit with the Bruno Mars assisted Nothing On You from B.O.B., Mars followed up that song with a equally successful single the Travie McCoy late summer hit Billionaire. On the heels of a possible jail sentence, we now have Bruno Mars debut album. Unlike hook singers Bruno decided to release his album while the iron was hot.\n1. Grenade - This is a rock influenced song where Bruno's vocals seem to go with beat very naturally. Mr. Mars even sings some of the riffs similar to the late MJ. *** out of ****\n2. Just The Way You Are - The lead single which is straight bubble gum pop. I'm a grown man so this song didn't really appeal to me but once again the vocals are good. *** out of ****\n3. Our First Time - I was waiting for a slow jam from Mr. Mars and this is one of the few on the CD. The arrangement reminds me of something that Robin Thicke would do. **** out of ****.\n4. Runaway Baby - As I soon as I heard the production on the song, I knew I wouldn't like it. Bruno gives one of his worst vocals on this track and it sounds like something Ricky Martin would have done back in 1999. * out of ****.\n5. The Lazy Song - Listening to this track, I got the feeling Bruno just wanted to have a humorous song on his disc. Just as the title implies this is a lazy song. ** out of ****.\n6. Marry You - I'm not really a rock fan but while listening to this song I did find myself tapping my feet and I could easily see this song being sung on an episode of Glee in a Will & Emma fantasy sequence. *** out of ****\n7. Talking To The Moon - Finally we have a track on par with Our First Time. I could easily relate to the message in the song about being away from a loved one.\n8. Liquor Store Blues (Feat. Damian Marley) - The production on this track was a little weak but the Damian Marley cameo saves it. *** out of ****.\n9. Count On Me - Count Of Me is a folk inspired ballad similar to something Jason Marz might be. If he doesn't go to jail and with a great band backing him, this song will sound great live. ****\n10. The Other Side (Feat Cee Lo Green & B.o. B) - The last song on the album gets some cool points since it's refreshing just to hear Cee Lo sing. *** out of ****\n\nOverall this isn't a horrible debut album, it is a mediocre album.  I thought for sure that Bruno would go for a straight R&B album with top notch production, instead he's given us a Jason Marz sounding album.  Bruno has a naturally smooth falsetto voice and while he couldn't handle to other falsetto's singers like El Debarge or Ralph Tresvant, the weak production on this disc hurts Bruno more than it helps. Given that Bruno is a fan of doo-wop I have to wonder why he didn't enlist the production of Raphael Saadiq who had an amazing album with the Motown inspired The Way I See It . If Bruno wants to have a longer career in the music industry he'll need to come a little stronger next time or his career could end up like Nate Dogg's.","classification":2,"fold":6}

{"text":"Having released live albums in 1968 (\"At Folsom Prison\") and 1969 (\"At San Quentin\"), this previously unreleased 1969 live show from New York's Madison Square Garden still manages to illuminate another side of Cash's performance. Given the pressure of the prison shows, not to mention their tailor-made set lists, this recording finds Cash less on-edge, providing a more accurate rendering of his then-current stage show. Everyone but a very pregnant June Carter Cash is on-board, including the Tennessee Three (Marshall Grant, W.S. Holland and Bob Wooten), Carl Perkins, Tommy Cash, The Statler Brothers and The Carter Family (including Mother Maybelle, and daughters Helen and Anita).\n\nThe set list covers many of Cash's most beloved songs (including a quartet of prison tunes, and a barn-burning take of \"Wreck of the Old 97\"), plus a generous helping of historical and folk classics, including Jane Bowers \"Remember the Alamo\" (recorded throughout the '50s and '60s by The Kingston Trio, Donovan, Willie Nelson and others). He provides contemporary commentary about the Vietnam War (\"when you watch the helicopters bringing in the wounded, that might make you a dove with claws\") and sings Ed McCurdy's \"Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream\" (a standard of the '60s folk revival, sung by The Weavers, Chad Mitchell, and Simon & Garfunkel, among others).\n\nThe ease and confidence with which Cash presents himself on stage is astounding, and more in evidence than in the live prison recordings. Spoken introductions to songs like \"Five Feet High and Rising\" pull everything together into a seamless presentation. Similarly, Cash's generous revue staging allows his compatriots -- each headliners in their own right -- to shine brightly. Carl Perkin's blazes through \"Blue Suede Shoes,\" The Statler Brothers sing a lively version of their crossover hit \"Flowers on the Wall,\" and the Carter Family performs a beautiful pair of songs from A.P. Carter's catalog (\"Wildwood Flower\" \"Worried Man Blues\"). Cash's sister-in-law, Helen Carter, provides a wonderfully warm introduction to the Carter Family segment.\n\nThe closing medley provides each member of the troupe a chance to give their twist on a Cash landmark. Johnny and his brother Tommy sing \"Do What You Do, Do Well,\" The Carter Family sings \"I Walk the Line,\" The Statler Brothers take on \"Ring of Fire,\" and Carl Perkins finds the rockabilly heart of \"Folsom Prison Blues.\" Cash closes out the show with a snippet of \"The Rebel - Johnny Yuma,\" and yet another reprise of \"Folsom Prison Blues.\" The crowd's thunderous applause draws an encore of \"Suppertime.\"\n\nThis is a beautiful (and generous: 77 minute!) stereo recording of a stage master at the peak of his powers, singing and speaking to an enthusiastic sell-out crowd. It is at once incredibly intimate and incredibly grand. The only improvement would have been to release it 33 years ago!","classification":5,"fold":6}

Everything that uses this song is equally as bad just for using this song, especially that Supercuts commercial. Because this song deserves no attention. It does not deserve to have any good things said about it. It is so bad that I would take this song out of existence and into the Devils wrath, because that where it belongs.

{"text":"I was anxious about this album when I bought it, I hoped it would be good but I had doubts, man was I blown away! Nevermind is a monumental album, it set standards and created a huge following for the grunge rock genre. Kurt Cobain was a genius, there is no doubt but let us not forget about Dave Grohl and Chris Novaselic, equally good musicians. Nirvana really was the greatest rock band ever and Nevermind reminds us of how in a few short years they shaped rock music and accomplished so much.\n\nEvery song on this album is terrific, it contains many classics and shows off Nirvana's talents. The first track has to be the most well known song by this band. Smells Like Teen Spirit is pure genius. The lyrics are perfect and so are the vocals. The chorus is just superb. I love this song so much, it's great. In Bloom is another 'standard' from this album and like the song before it, it has a great chorus. Again also a classic. Come As You Are is a more laid-back track and not as energetic as Teen Spirit and In Bloom. I really like Kurt's vocals on this track.\n\nBreed is classic Nirvana, killer rifs and superb writing, it's a really energetic and fast paced song. The chorus is again great.\n\nIt may start off a bit slow but soon Lithium gets paced and really packs a punch. The guitar is great on this track.\n\nPolly shows Nirvana's softer and acoustic side. The song is really haunting. The next song may be short but is a standout on this album and contains Grohl's superb incredibly fast drums and Kurts screams. The song overall is great.\n\nDrain You is a classic rock song where surprisingly the verse is better than the chorus. It starts off with Novaselic's trademark bass line and moves in all directions but overall a great song, that's Lounge Act. Stay Away is Nirvana and probably the catchiest song on the album and has great echo\/response sections to it. On A Plain is quite experimental in which Kurt sings \"I love myself better than you\". This paves the way for a spectacular ballad, Something In The Way. It contains a superb cello and Kurt's voice is full of longing and emotion.\n\nAnyway you look at this album you realise what an impact it had on society. Nirvana were tragic talents, Kurts death was a shock to the industry and will remain a huge loss forever. They may have been around for less than a decade but they are now appearing on all sorts of 'best of all-time' lists.\n\nAmazing.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"My mother wasn't a gypsy and my father's never picked up a guitar in his life, but like the narrator of this song, I was born and raised in southern California.  Hours and hours of my late-'80s, early-'90s childhood was spent on those notorious SoCal freeways - and no, the rush-hour traffic isn't anywhere near as bad as you've heard.  Actually it's much worse.  I never minded long car rides, however, because my mother had a CD player in the car.  My brother and I took turns picking out what we wanted to hear, and I loved to press my face up against the window and let the music wash over me, carrying me away to a new exhilarating place in my mind where I was so very alive and free.  Sometimes we listened to my mother's contemporary-Christian albums or Disney soundtracks, but she also borrowed frequently from my uncle's collection of rock CDs.  I grew up listening to Journey, Billy Idol, Meat Loaf, Billy Joel . . .\n\nMy first thought when I started listening to Night Ranger's \"Growin' Up in California\" was that if I didn't know better, I'd think I was listening to a Journey song I'd never heard before.  This is the same kind of achingly powerful rock, almost over-the-top with guitar and percussion and solid male vocals, that you've heard in \"Any Way You Want It\" and \"Don't Stop Believin'.\"  The lyrics are reminiscent of Journey as well - straightforward and upbeat, yet laced with a subtle melancholy that's hard to explain.\n\nThey just don't make music like this anymore - and whereas some of my favorite music was first released in the past 15 years, a song with this distinctive sound has the power to take me right back to my preteen years, when I first discovered the power of music.  You don't have to be a fan of classic rock to enjoy this passionate track, but if you are, it should be a special delight to hear those nostalgic sounds in a brand-new song.","classification":4,"fold":6}

They were influenced by 1960s girl groups, pop bands, The Beach Boys, and early punk rock acts. \"Rock N Roll High School\" is a track from their latest album 'Osaka Romones - Tribute To The Ramones' (available only in MP3 format currently).  It is a cheerful version rather than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/angrier-original\/dp\/B00000JFUY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">angrier original<\/a>&nbsp;and sounds like something you might hear while watching 'Teen Titans' or some other modern kids cartoon. They in fact have done soundtrack work and are on the Powerpuff Girls soundtrack 'Heroes and Villains'. So I'm not saying their rendition is bad ...just different.\n\nI like the song well enough, but it isn't something I'd play every day. The rest of 'Osaka Romones' sounds much the same, so if you like enjoy Shonen Knife's take on \"Rock N Roll High School\" and J-Pop in general, then you might want to add it to your Cloud Player and jam out with the three girls from Osaka.\n\n~ Kort-san","classification":3,"fold":6}
{"text":"Earth Wind & Fire: Greatest Hits has many hits that I remember from when I was a kid in school; it brings back a lot of memories for me. This is a strong single CD compilation although as others have noted it doesn't give you every last one of their hits. However, what we do get is very high quality control music from Earth Wind & Fire; and that's great. The quality of the sound is excellent and I like that artwork, too.\n\n\"Shining Star\" rocks! This came out and hit the airwaves big time! Earth Wind & Fire simply never sounded better. They really handle this well; they never skip a beat nor do they ever let go of a superfluous note. The tempo and key changes make the number strong; and they sing this very well. \"That's The Way Of The World\" quickly shifts gears for a much more mellow sounding tune; this features the group squarely in the spotlight--right where they belonged and still belong! \"That's The Way Of The World\" was always one of my very favorite Earth Wind & Fire tunes; and I think just one listen will tell you why--this is all THAT good.\n\n\"September\" has an awesome beat that would even get the dead tapping their feet to the rhythm; \"September\" was yet another huge hit that got a lot of airplay when it was originally released. I still hear it sometimes on an \"oldies\" radio station in my area; and that's grand. \"Got To Get You Into My Life\" is one heck of a snazzy tune; they make this a masterpiece and they deliver this with a lot of feeling. In addition, \"Sing A Song\" has them harmonizing to perfection--and beyond! \"Sing A Song\" is another major hit on this CD.\n\n\"Serpentine Fire\" uses the percussion to great advantage; and of course another big hit for this group is \"Fantasy.\" \"Fantasy\" charms me with its beauty and it's truly a stand-out on this album--how could they ever get better than this? I'm amazed. \"Mighty Mighty\" has quite a beat that gets you up and dancing nearly wherever you are; and listen for \"Reasons.\" \"Reasons\" has a mellow, pensive flavor to it that is absolutely stunning--and the backup singers harmonize well.\n\n\"Let's Groove\" is another tune that still sounds good all these years later; and I really like \"Boogie Wonderland\" which Earth Wind & Fire performs with The Emotions. \"Boogie Wonderland\" was a huge success for these artists and I still love to hear it today. \"After The Love Has Gone\" again showcases Earth Wind & Fire at their mellow best; and the album ends strong with Earth Wind & Fire performing \"Getaway.\" \"Getaway\" has a strong beat that makes me want to dance; and it also leaves me wanting so much more!\n\nThis is a great album for fans of Earth Wind & Fire, but if truth be told they would need other CDs to have all of the hits from this fantastic group. This album is particularly good for the casual fan who wants most of their hits on one single CD; and it makes an excellent starter CD for people just discovering the fine talents of Earth Wind & Fire.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Just saw Foreigner live at Florida State Fairgrounds Ampitheater in Tampa, FL.  They were awesome.  The live version of this song was very awesome.  Sure, Kelly Hanson is not Lou Gramm.  But neither is Lou Gramm anymore.  Kelly Hanson is better in my opinion.  And like everyone I am entitled to my opinion.  This rendition of the song sounds like what the song would have sounded like had Kelly Hanson gone back via a time machine to those days when this song was first recorded.  It has the common restrained sound of the Columbia Records (or similar labels) of 1970s under the control of the likes of engineer who mastered the original Journey albums with Steve Perry.  Like Steve Perry of the 1970s, Kelly Hanson's voice sounds like it should for studio master recordings.  Studio is never meant to sound like live.  Some people seem to want what they had in Lou Gramm.  He's still there in the original recordings.  I was never of the mind that a song can only be recorded by one person and one person alone.  Sure, I love Lou Gramm same as anyone else.  He recorded the soundtrack of my early high school years.  But it is very nice to hear Kelly Hanson sing these songs.  And to know that when I am going to sit next to someone at the modern concerts they may possibly have heard Kelly sing these songs and hear the voice that they recognize.  A voice that sounds amazing when unrestrained and allowed to soar at concerts.  And I for one, among many, many, many others love it when the voice that will sing at the concerts is the voice you hear in the concert commercials.  Bravo Foreigner for keeping the band alive.  Bravo Kelly Hanson for doing a fine job with vocals. And bravo once again to Lou Gramm for giving us vocals to songs that we want to hear over and over again until we die.  Lou lit the torch for Foreigner and Kelly made it brighter keeping it lit Saturday night.  Rock on Foreigner.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Veruca Salt CDs have never been over-loaded with lyrics or liner notes or pictures (8 Arms has the OK foldout poster; Blow It... has the best album cover image); this CD ships in a gatefold eco-pak with only barebones personnel notes, no photos, so if you're looking to crush out on images of the reunited band members -- who all have aged insanely well -- better have a computer or iPhone nearby. Granted, most kids likely have no recollection of getting a new album and pouring over the album art while you listen to it for the first time.\n\nOn the plus side, there are no diversions while you rock out -- it's a stellar album.

{"text":"As a Mississippian, Def Jam artist and XXL Freshman from 2011, the King Remembered In Time, or Big K.R.I.T., has come a long way in the five years preceding his cosmic 2014 sophomore Cadillactica. Four highly regarded mixtapes of Southern flair and wisdom have done more than create a buzz for K.R.I.T., and his 2012 studio debut, Live From The Underground, secured his position as one of The Dirty's top rap prophets of the new era.\n\nThis Cadillactica LP is a full examination of god, life, love and pain from K.R.I.T.'s unique perspective in which he explores many topics. He places great weight on the love and cohesion of family when he laments about the anguish of broken, disconnected families in \"Soul Food.\" Additionally, his gentlemanly side comes out in \"Pay Attention\" and \"Third Eye\" where he raps about fine, refined ladies. K.R.I.T.'s planet of abstract thought, or what he calls his Cadillactica, is a serene, confident mind state that makes obvious the name of his favorite make of town car. Cadillac imagery pops up in \"Cadillactica\" and the allegorical \"Do You Love Me For Real\" about the love that a man has for his woman and his ride. Toward the end of the album, he gets critical of music industry trends and encourages having an open mind. At various points, K.R.I.T. takes the liberty of jumping around with subject matter but remains logical and makes everything come together as relatable under the same roof. He has a refreshing fighting spirit of hopefulness that appropriately remedies the sadness and adversity in his surroundings. At the same time he is exceptionally lyrical, poetic and metaphorical with his swaggering flow. Because of his brainy, philosophical rumination, one might think the man too soft, but the moments where he gets tough and vicious instantly invalidate that idea.\n\nBig K.R.I.T. has produced some of the album, but he has also invited several other producers to give Cadillactica a very original musical vibe. Perhaps not as sample heavy as some of his mixtapes, Cadillactica contains fresh synths, throwback loops, an 808-style bass line or two, and other funky instruments like the jazzy, muted trumpet in \"Mo Better Cool,\" which also contains hip, danceable, drum taps. All the sounds light up the album like stars in a night sky. Several talented singers and rappers contribute verses but never asphyxiate K.R.I.T.'s artistic expression.\n\nCadillactica is a colorful, comprehensive mosaic of musical influences. It's not hard to identify the different rappers who K.R.I.T. has drawn from for his style, but rest assured, his is a unique, one of a kind style that can hold up on its own. As the title to the seventh track suggests, K.R.I.T. is a rising king of the South who is giving other South stars like T.I. and Lil Wayne a run for the money. His talent and exuberance in Cadillactica make for an album that will have a special place in the hearts of fans \"4eva.\"","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Up until a few years ago, the only \"zig\" I knew was the \"zig-a-zig-ah!\" lyric from the Spice Girls' \"Wannabe\" (teenage fixations are dangerous). Bowie's Ziggy, of course, is an iconic character that I had often heard of. Listening to \"Nothing has changed\", has made me realise that David Bowie is an artist rather underrated by my generation. Prolific is an adjective often used to describe him, as well as his ever-changing music styles. The 59 tracks included on this, cleverly presented in reverse chronological order, are sheer proof. What impresses me more than anything is that, despite his later work which I am more familiar with, most of his early material sounds just as, or even more, interesting. His shift from troubadour to glam rock king, and others changing roles in between, is certainly admirable. And the quality of the songwriting is mighty fine, too. Diversity and experimentation were obviously no strangers to him! The artwork and packaging offer an extra nice touch to this already special item. Presented in a gatefold cardboard case that opens to reveal 4 images from different stages of DB looking in the mirror (vanity is no stranger to him either!), it is certainly worth spending a little extra in order to have the more comprehensive 3-disc package, which comes with 2 booklets (pity that no lyrics are included). As a casual listener of David Bowie's music, \"Nothings has changed\" is brilliantly comprehensive, absolutely essential to anyone's record collection. I am super pleased that I finally got to get properly introduced to Ziggy Stardust!\n\nUPDATE (12\/1\/2016): Upon reading the sad news of David Bowie's passing, I urge everyone to buy this collection and experience its brilliance. I have been listening to his brand new album, \"Blackstar\", and it is almost shocking to know that it was in the works for the past year, making this carefully orchestrated farewell all the more poignant, as a visionary artist's final statement. David Bowie made sure that he offered his audience another interesting piece of work till the very end. Talk about ending on a high note, going out as a true star, well, blackstar.","classification":5,"fold":6}
{"text":"Today, I'm awakening to the reality that there is a reason why much of what passes for Christmas music is so boring - no guitar solos!  Apart from the epic Christian metal band, Theocracy who has a tradition of releasing a new Christmas song every December, the prospect of a good guitar solo in a Christmas song is about as likely as a witnessing a reindeer flying through the clouds.  However, the wait is over with the release of Lincoln Brewster's new album, Joy to the World.\n\nLincoln treats listeners to a musical cacophony that is sure to please many kinds of music lovers, especially fans of sweeping Stratocaster guitar licks that have made him a household name.  The album begins on a triumphant note with Brewster's version of Joy to the World.  The arrangement is fresh and pulsates with the vitality that Isaac Watts surely meant to convey.\n\nHark the Herald Angels Sing is a reverent rendition that moves with a majestic series of notes and a killer guitar solo.  I can see Charles Wesley slouching down in his chair and smiling to himself, caught up in the truth the song intends to convey:\n\nChrist by highest heav'n adored\/Christ the everlasting Lord\/Late in time behold Him come\/Offspring of a Virgin's womb\/Veiled in flesh the Godhead see\/Hail the incarnate Deity\/Pleased with man to dwell\/Jesus, our Emmanuel\/Hark! the Herald angel's sing\/Glory to the newborn King!\n\nMiraculum is a 6 minute Christmas feast for the ears.  The tune makes eager listeners wonder when Lincoln will release a solo instrumental album.  This is Lincoln Brewter at his best - a blues influence, laced with arpeggios that has a Keaggy feel to it.\n\nThe rest of the album is musically rich, doctrinally sound and points listeners to the birth of our Savior.  This is Christmas music at its finest!  And it's a bargain for $5 on Amazon.com.\n\n5 stars","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Although it's hard to fathom, but Eric Benet has been in the business for two decades. He originally got his start by singing with his sister Lisa Jordan in a duo called Benet. When that project didn't go anywhere, Eric went on to do other things. He lended his talents as a background singer on Michael Franks' 1993 album \"Dragonfly Summer\", which lead to him signing with Franks' label Warner Bros. Records. While recording his debut, he endured the tragedy of his girlfriend dying in a car accident. In 1996, he released his debut \"True To Myself\", which featured the quiet storm favorites \"Let's Stay Together\" and \"Femininity\". Three years later, he issued his most successful album to date \"A Day In The Life\". It spawned two hits- the Toto remake \"Georgy Porgy\" and the Tamia duet \"Spend My Life With You\". While he was recording his next album, his career suffered another setback: His album \"Better And Better\" ended up being shelved. In its place, he released \"Hurricane\", an album that was mostly produced by soft rock mavens David Foster and Walter Afanasieff. He got back on track with 2008's \"Love & Life\" and released what came to be his final recording for Warner Bros., 2010's \"Lost In Time\".\n\nIn 2012, Eric Benet released his latest recording \"The One\". It's his first album for the EMI Records label who distributes his imprint Jordan House. On this album, he reunites with his longtime producers Demonte Posey and George Nash, Jr.- the same producers behind \"True To Myself\", \"Love & Life\", \"Lost In Time\" and roughly half of \"A Day In The Life\". He starts the album off with the uptempo \"Harriet Jones\", where he pines for the return of a lost love. He channels the sound of Maze featuring Frankie Beverly on the ballad \"News For You\" and celebrates the concept of finding happiness on \"Real Love\". He sings about his once neverending search for Mrs. Right on \"Runnin'\" and gets help from Lil' Wayne on the potentially controversial \"Redbone Girl\". He experiments with a couple of other genres, such as reggae on the Shaggy featured \"Hope That It's You\", jazz on the innuendo laced \"Come Together\" and country music on the hidden bonus track \"Come Home To Me\". He also makes a couple of references to his two daughters on \"The One\". He duets with his oldest daughter India on the song \"Muzik\" and sings about his newborn on \"Here In My Arms (Lucia's Lullaby)\". Overall, Eric Benet's \"The One\" is a strong recording from the neo-soul stalwart. While he does step out of his comfort zone on a few songs, he still sticks to what he does best.","classification":4,"fold":6}

Had Otis lived many of the songs on this album would undoubtedly have been huge hits that would have propelled him to greater success but , if anything, this album proves that Otis Redding's death was a truly devastating blow to the music world but his music was so real and so transcendental that it has stood the test of time most admirably.

{"text":"The person who wrote that bad review about Kurt Cobain is a clown with a capital C. That is why his name is Corcky. By the way, I read your other reviews. As much as I like Pearl Jam Binaural is not a five star album. Also I would take Nirvana over Pearl Jam anyday. Pearl Jam haven't exactly made ground breaking albums since 1994. I think If Kurt Cobain was alive he would have made many more incredible albums. I would take Nevermind and In Utero anyday over any Pearl Jam albums. Again I am a huge Pearl Jam fan, but I think Nirvana was much better when they were around. I am bored of all Nirvana albums because I have listened to them so many times since 1995. But, for a new music fan these albums are essential for the 90's. When I first listened to these albums I was blown away. I can't really say that about many other albums. Artists today can take a lesson or two from a band like Nirvana. They were original and that is what made them so great. Love them or hate them their is no denying the talent of a lead singer like Kurt Cobain. I feel bad for the kids today cause most of the music sucks. I do like bands like Linkin Park, but most bands today don't have the emotion and heart like a band like Nirvana. I really feel Kurt Cobain was like our Lennon of the 90's. I also love the Beatles too. Kurt Cobain never got the chance to put out a huge body of work to prove himself. Check out a band called Bright Eyes. I saw them in concert a few days ago. I can't believe how much heart and talent this 24 year old lead singer has(Conor Oberst). At the end of the show he smashed his equipment. He also sang an anti-Bush song with so much passion I thought it was the early 90's. My friends think it's sad, but I like bands like Good Charlotte and New Found Glory, but they truly lack that rock star passion. If you disagree with me you simply  weren't old enough in the early 90's to experience the music. Like I said go to a Bright Eyes concert and you will see pure talent, heart, and passion. Something that most bands today don't display.","classification":5,"fold":6}

The songs are powerful, fist pumping anthems.  I can't believe Na Na Na didn't get more airplay than it did.  It's a phenomenal track that sets the tone for the rest of the album.  Lying below the surface of these songs is an optimistic, fun driven spirit.  I'm glad they didn't try to do a sequel to the Black Parade.  I think this one outshines their breakthrough, and ought to be given much more recognition than it's gained so far.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"The Killers' much anticipated follow up album SAM'S TOWN doesn't come across quite as \"sheeny\" (for lack of a better word) as The Killers' double platinum debut HOT FUSS did.  While some may view that positively or negatively, one must not forget that that albums sporter first-rate singles including first \"Somebody Told Me\", followed by the even more infectious, ubiquitous \"Mr. Brightside\", and closing with the slightly less embraced, though strong \"All These Things I've Done\". Let's face it people, we were all singing the words to \"Mr. Brightside\" and we couldn't resist singing the lines \"I have soul but I'm not a soldier\" from \"All These Things I've Done\".  SAM'S TOWN is consistent with HOT FUSS and even hearkens to be bigger, more athemic in some respects compared to their debut, but it isn't any better and in some respects it isn't as fun as the debut.\n\nSure, \"When We Were Young\" is the addictive single from this album when frontman Brandon Flowers sings \"He doesn't look a thing like Jesus\", but it isn't as addictive or as predominant as the hooks from either \"Somebody Told Me\" or \"Mr. Brightside\".  Sure, the Killers want to be taken seriously and SAM'S TOWN is a good move in that vein of thinking, but it isn't enough to topple the greatness of HOT FUSS.  Opening track \"Sam's Town\" is certainly a first rate experiment with more U2 veined rock and roll and while it isn't quite as convincing as U2, it is convincing enough.  The tag at the end of the track certainly works well as well as the chorus.  The timbre of the track is also first rate.\n\n\"Bling (Confession of A King)\" is another solid first rate track, mixing \"college\" rock with the added \"sheen\" of keyboards.  \"Bones\" is another stand out and \"The River Is Wild\" isn't too shabby either.  Too often on SAM'S TOWN everything sounds that same as opposed to being its own seperate entity.  Is SAM'S TOWN bad.  No, it is another solid album and maybe even to an extent an move in the right direction for the Killers.  But it isn't extraodinary and it doesn't necessarily trump any of the best rock releases of 2006.  However, I do think that hardcore Killers fans will enjoy this release and maybe even the non-fan may even be converted.  3 stars.","classification":3,"fold":6}

It's like Billie Holiday - you don't listen for exemplary audio, but for her inimitable voice.  Same here, plus you are unlikely to ever hear many of these songs another way.

Her latest album hasn't shown to deliver in voice and absolute heart, and instead felt like a piece of garbage. XO, the latest single from the Beyonce', self-titled record tries to bring in a intimate sound in her voice, similar to the sound that Coldplay had brought well in their sound. Sadly, she has also brought in bad blows by borrowing the sound from the space shuttle Challenger which was blown up in 1986 into the song, not a good move for the Queen Bee, hurting the memory of those lost souls.

{"text":"Mary J. Blige returns with her eighth studio album, \"Growing pains\". I've been a fan of hers ever since she burst onto the scene singing about \"Real love\". Sixteen years later, she's still as strong as ever; \"Growing pains\" became her fourth US chart topping album and has sold over a million so far. It's the latest instalment in a musical journey, which intentionally or not has chronicled the state of her life at the time of each release.\n\nThis is no different. Very much in love (with her husband and with herself), the songs reflect this. From lead-off single, the upbeat joyous hand-clap filled \"Just fine\" where she states she's just that, thank you (from the same team that gave Rihanna her chart \"raining\" hit \"Umbrella\"), opening cut \"Work that\" (a song of female self belief\/assertion no matter what you look like, lovely song), the more sparse guitar driven \"Grown woman\" (with Ludacris), There is a bit to dance to. \"Roses\" is an angry mid tempo song with unsettling beats (where you wouldn't want to mess with her; she's having one of them days), and closing cut \"Come to me (peace)\" is a lovely song with a hypnotic throbbing bassline and a pop feel (Love it!).\n\nFor ballads, we have just about everything else, with lyrics dealing with unabashed love,  or vulnerability; \"Shake down\" (a duet with Usher), \"Feel like a woman\", \"Stay down\", \"Hurt again\" (lovely harmonies), the string swathed \"What love is\", \"Work in progress (growing pains)\" (with autobiographical lyrics, the title says it all), \"Talk to me\" (where she's trying to rekindle conversation in the relationship), the piano sprinkled \"If you love me\", and the pseudo jazz feel of \"Smoke\" (with a slightly off kilter beat).\n\nMy favourite cut is her song about wanting to get away from it all when things get tough; \"Fade away\", a dreamy plodding mid-tempo number (a bit like \"Everything\" from \"Share my world\") with soothing harmonies. It's like sailing on a calm sea. Outstanding!\n\nMary has been on an upward tangent ever since the day she appeared on the scene, a tangent that shows no sign of dipping any day soon.","classification":5,"fold":6}
{"text":"Bonnie Pointer's First Solo Album is a classic waiting to be rediscovered. A varied album of different styles, all produced & performed so amazingly, it holds up well today. There is funk, Motown oldies, acoustic tracks, & a great orchestrated ballad. The music, the musicianship, and the vocals are all very creative and of the highest calibre.\n\n Side One has 2 Motown oldies WHEN I'M GONE and HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU that are both done in the old Motown style. They even have legendary Motown bassist JAMES JAMERSON playing on them. This version of HEAVEN is five minutes and features scat singing by Bonnie in the middle. This is a different version from the disco hit single that went to #11 on the charts. Bonnie redid it as a single, and I much prefer the album version , with it's homage to classic Motown. The other 2 tracks are both stellar, with inventive arrangements, singing & playing. The single FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM\/TIE ME TO A TREE [ HANDCUFF ME ] is amazing. Pop\/funk with Bonnie singing all the background vocals herself, and in the middle there is a banjo solo! That's what I mean about the creativity and work that Bonnie, the musicians and producer Jeffrey Bowen [ who previously produced The Temptations ] put into this album. And you have not heard a funk track as hot and funky as AH SHOOT, I guarantee you since Sly & The Family Stone's THANK YOU. This song is 5 minutes of pure funk nastiness with an organ that drives it, blazingly funky horns a\/la James Brown, Bonnie's muti-faceted  vocals & just sheer musical genius at it's height. Outkast must have heard this track. It's just waiting to be sampled. The musicians on this album are of top calibre with Family Stone member TRUMAN THOMAS arranging, playing & co-writing , Funkadelic guitarist EDDIE HAZEL, Rolling Stones sideman OLLIE BROWN, original Motown bassist JAMES JAMERSON, NIGEL OLSSON of Elton John's band on one track, and string arrangements by noted arrangers LEE HOLDRIDGE and PAUL RISER.\n\n And Side Two illustrates another side to Bonnie Pointer, with 4 acoustic rhythmically driven & played songs MORE AND MORE, I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, I WANNA MAKE IT [ IN YOUR WORLD ], and the beautiful ballad MY EVERYTHING that closes this unique, diverse album of sheer musical pleasure. These 4 numbers all co-written by DONALD BALDWIN are amazing - filled with hooks, catchy choruses, and pure musicianship. Remember Bonnie's solo on BLACK COFFEE from The Pointer Sisters 2nd album THAT'S A PLENTY. That is just a taste of what Bonnie can do with a ballad.\n\n Also of note is that this self-titled album is the one with a RED COVER. For some unknown reason, Motown released Bonnie's 2nd album with the same self-titled name, and that has a purple cover. Also it's not as great as this one. Released in Dec. 1978, the same time as The Pointer Sisters equally excellent ENERGY album, this is a classic that has to be heard. It is by far the best of Bonnie's 3 solo albums. Catalog number is MOTOWN M7-911R1.\n\n Tracks: WHEN I'M GONE, FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM\/TIE ME TO A TREE [HANDCUFF ME ], HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU, AH SHOOT, MORE AND MORE, I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, I WANNA MAKE IT [ IN YOUR WORLD ], MY EVERYTHING.\n\n Released on MOTOWN M7-911RI, December 1978, Red Cover.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"JIMMIE VAUGHAN-STRANGE PLEASURE: As a tastefully restrained guitarist for the Austin, Texas-based FABULOUS THUNDERBIRDS, JIMMIE VAUGHAN laid down a roots-wranglin' vibe that spearheaded a most welcome blues rock revival in the eighties along side ROBERT CRAY, ALBERT COLLINS and VAUGHAN's axe slingin' sibling STEVIE RAY. After his departure from the T-BIRDS, JIMMIE's highly anticipated solo debut STRANGE PLEASURE showcased a stunning set of solid originals including the chugging BOOM-BAPA-BOOM, upbeat instrumental TILT A WHIRL, and the stark, acoustic SIX STRINGS DOWN, a soul-stirring tribute to departed blues heroes like FREDDIE KING, MUDDY WATERS, GUITAR SLIM and of course SRV. VAUGHAN's multi-faceted six string runs and lean, purposeful vocals propel sublime slices of boss soul and roadhouse-honed RNB with nary a weak track within earshot; in a perfect world, HEY-YEAH, FLAMENCO DANCER, and JUST LIKE PUTTY might have been adult contemporary radio hits. JV's output has been frustratingly slim over the past two decades, but STRANGE PLEASURE fired off an opening shot that few debuts can ever hope to stack up against.\n\nRATING: FIVE POMPADOURS","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"In 1979, a double LP, simply crimson with gold leaf lettering SinatraJobim Sessions found its way into more than a few rock and jazz boomer collections.  Antonio Carlos Jobim had gone from Brazilian Bossa Nova legend to a big name regular in the Creed Taylor CTI Jazz stable.  I was one of those who picked it up even though Frank Sinatra was my Fathers music, he was still cool and probably more so in the 70s because he went from covering My Music (Heres to you Mrs. Robinson, ooby dooby doo) to doing some stand up appreciable real jazz and resembling the towering mighty man who fronted Harry James and Tony Dorseys orchestras and rose to superstardom in the 50s and made cool-jazz music with His Highness Basie.  The only way to lay your hands on this prize was as an import in places like Tower Records or if you knew of its existence you could have your mom and pop record store order it for you at a price.  Only Jobim fans and extremely serious Sinatra fans knew about it from articles.  The other way to get this material was to back order the old Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim (1967) and Sinatra & Company (1971) but you were still left without three of the tracks they did together: \"Bonita\", \"Sabi\", and \"Off Key (Desafinado)\".  The 10 track Francis Albert Sinatra & Antnio Carlos Jobim, arranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman, accompanied by a studio orchestra, is very nice but the real prize was the eagerly sought other half of the Sessions arranged by Deodato (stable-mate of Jobim in CTI, and 2nd greatest Brazilian jazz man after Jobim alongside the Joo Gilberto family) and conducted by Morris Stoloff.  Of particular note: Francis Albert Sinatra & Antnio Carlos Jobim was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, but lost to the Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  Darn those Beatles!  Sinatra and Jobim worked together for a final time in 1994 on Duets II, recording a cover of \"Fly Me to the Moon\" if you want to be complete you will have to get that one too!\n\nThe original collection of Sinatra & Jobim tracks on their collaborations included two recordings which do not actually feature Jobim, \"Drinking Again\" and \"Manh De Carnaval.  SINATRA\/JOBIM: THE COMPLETE REPRISE RECORDINGS does not include them, instead you get all 20 original recordings featuring both artists in their work of genius together.  As Amazon does not see fit to give you the track listings on the CD, here is the full lineup with credits:\n\n1. The Girl from Ipanema (Antnio Carlos Jobim, Norman Gimbel, Vincius de Moraes)  3:20\n2.  Dindi (Ray Gilbert, Jobim, Aloysio de Oliveria)  3:31\n3.  Change Partners (Irving Berlin)  2:43\n4.

I have varying levels of insomnia (depending on the day and my anxiety level) and struggle to get to sleep as well as stay asleep, to make things worse, medication only seems to work for me for about a week before my body grows accustomed to it and the medication stops working. My therapist introduced me to meditation and, after I commented on how well it worked during our sessions, suggested that I try it before bed to help clear my mind. These work great for this. I especially like the ones with the birds and\/or wind sounds, it's so peaceful and not obnoxious like some of the others I've heard with excess sounds. They help me visualize that I'm in a field or something in the middle of nowhere.

{"text":"It's great to hear a Dre album again, and it's also great to know he's staying creative because no artist should stay the same so screw all you cornballs who thought Dre should keep that ole chronic sound, a person can only worship drugs for so long you idiots. Don't get me wrong, because I do love those 90's Dre albums, but like 2pac said, \"can't no man stay in one spot forever \". You have to change, the older you get you must become wiser. Much love to Dre for digging deep within his soul on this album this is what reality rap is suppose to sound like, it was great to hear Cold187um from above the law on this album and that excerpt from Eazy-E was hella cool, plus we all knew ice cube, snoop, Kendrick, & eminem was gonna bring it. I only wish that Mc Ren, Kokane, Mc eiht, Yella, and Quik were on this cd then it would've been even more complete. Much love to Dre for bringing that positive feel back to hip hop. We need it, because most of today's cheesy negative loving no message having rappers are getting on my nerves, and I'm also tired of wannabe thug reviewers who give garbage albums like meek mill and lil boosie 5 stars but talk down on creative rappers like Kendrick and big krit, and get mad at Dre who is Kendrick's producer for creating and album that's actually saying something with eclectic jazzy funked out beats. Cube made great hard positive political albums with lethal injection, death certificate, Predator, and laugh now cry later and Mc Ren had great messages in his music  with shock of the hour and rebel music, and they still kept it hood like Dre is doing with this album. Eazy would've been proud of this album because it's real street knowledge and it's not an old cat trying to be young and belligerent, it's an older cat spitting knowledge to the young and ignorant. A tight cd you can ride to like back in the 90's. So if you like that same ole cheesy club thug tricking on a slut using all types of drugs type of garbage music then this cd isn't for you, but if you like creativity, tight beats and real street lyrics to ride to and make you think then buy this instant classic.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"After the physically excrutiating World Slavery Tour, which lasted 11 months and consited of 193 shows, Maiden took sixth month a break to recharge their batteries and in January 1986, got back together to write their first album to feature synths: SOMEWHERE IN TIME. This was the first album NOT to be part of the Golden Years era, and the first of their \"Experimentation\" era.\n\nThis is Maiden's best 80s album they ever recorded. Best listening  setting would be on a cold winter night, in the house with a fire going on and the lights out. But really, it's great anytime and anywhere.\n\nCAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME: 10+\/10: BEST MAIDEN OPENER EVER. From the moment that the Blade Runner-ish intro to the song blasts out of the speakers, you're in for a very fun ride! The song goes into a gallop that is fast, heavy, and awesome, and contains the 2nd most amazing Guitar solo from Adrian! This song sounds great live too, in fact the Osaka '87 bootleg version sounds fantastic.\n\nWASTED YEARS: 9\/10: A beautiful song with amazing lyrics. Apparently the band wrote this while on the World Slavery Tour, and you can tell. Bruce's voice is fantastic on this, and the intro is pretty cool.\n\nSEA OF MADNESS: 10+\/10: Maiden's heaviest track yet, and maybe even the best song on the album! Bruce's voice soars, and the guitar truly makes the song. The vocal haromony is great.\n\nHEAVEN CAN WAIT: 8\/10: Very catchy and singalong-able track, and the bridge is very popular where fans go onstgage at concerts and sing the oohing part. I wish I was onstage at the show I went to, especially with my favorite band (Maiden, of course)! This sounded fantastic at the show I went to on June 6th!\n\nTHE LONLINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE RUNNER: 9\/10: The tediousness of the ridiculously long title, but other than that, this song ROCKS!!!!! The gallop is fantastic, Bruce's vocals shine on the album here. And the \"I've got to keep ruuuunning...\" part just blows me away everytime I hear it.\n\nSTRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND: 10\/10: A catchy song that does a good job at creating a desperate mood. Definitely creates a video in your head too, of a desperate man lost and looking for help.\n\nDEJA VU: 4\/10: This song isn't that bad, but the song sounds like it was recorded in one take (in other words rushed- Moonchild was recorded in one take but at least it sounded awesome), plus Bruce sounds awful on this song.\n\nALEXANDER THE GREAT: 10\/10: A fantastic epic song that creates the \"warrior\" feel. Time signature change is very prominent here, and Bruce and Adrian truly shine, as well as Nicko's drumming is fantastic.\n\nOverall, this is Maiden's best 80s album. I got it back in Febuary and have loved it ever since. BRAVE NEW WORLD is my favorite Maiden album, but this one still rocks! Buy it if you don't have it!","classification":5,"fold":6}
{"text":"Lovers of the traditional as well as lovers of music more modern are all likely to love this version of a classic Christmas carol. This song is filled with so many different stylistic approaches towards \"Angels We Have Heard on High\" that it's difficult to imagine how it would be possible to pull everything together into a cohesive whole.  But For King & Country is talented enough to be up to the challenge.  They manage the transition from a traditional carol to a more modern take on the music quite well, to the point of almost making it seem as if this was the way the song was always intended to be played.

I only listened to it twice all the way through at the time and have not touched it until now, giving it it's third thorough listening for this review.\n\nTo give you a perspective on my own tastes, I gave up on them at Train Of Thought and did not take another look at them until A Dramatic Turn Of Events. I hate Train Of Thought so much that I refuse to own a copy. So if you hate Train Of Thought, you will probably like this one,  and vice versa.\n\nReading a description of the story had me grimace because it is utterly ridiculous. John was indeed inspired by Game Of Thrones and Star Wars. However, it comes off as a bad imitation of the great Arjen Anthony Lucassen. Somehow, the vocals of James Labrie and the musical compositions manage to pull it off and save it from total disaster. It is not the band's fault that old folks like me often have the attention span of gnat and have no desire to sit through 34 songs that mean absolutely nothing at all to them. I still applaud them for this great effort.\n\nOn a positive note, it is still much better than the drek being played on the radio these days. Also, once it is made into a movie or play, it will gain them a new group of fans while losing some of their old ones.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"[This review is of the standard three disc (50 tracks) edition]\n\nFifty years after forming, the Rolling Stones release 'GRRR!,' a career retrospective that, imo, is far superior to their 40th anniversary release, 'Forty Licks,' though it's debatable whether it's really essential for owners of that set, even with the two new tracks and slightly better sound. Like that previous collection, it serves as both a great introduction to the band for newcomers, and as a nice compilation of their most essential tracks for the casual fan. But, even more so than that last set, it also serves as a remarkable historical document for the more serious fan, showing the evolution of one of rock's most important bands.\n\nThe key advantage that this collection holds over 'Forty Licks'--besides the fact that it's ten tracks longer--is that the track sequencing is in chronological order (though the Summer of Love-era \"She's a Rainbow\" is placed with the early 70's tracks for some reason), and shows just how far the band had come in just a few short years, from a charismatic R&B covers act with an attitude to one of the biggest and most influential bands in the world. There are 24 tracks from the 60's, twelve from the 70's, seven from the 80's, three from the 90's, and four from the 21st century--two being brand new--providing a pretty comprehensive overview of their career.\n\nThe sound quality on 'GRRR!' is stellar, with none of the clipping (distortion, basically) common to a lot of modern day reissues of older material, as it appears this collection uses the same versions as were on the excellently remastered albums released over the past decade or so (though edited in some cases)*. The songs do seem slightly louder than on their remastered studio album counterparts and 'Forty Licks,' but the dynamic range is not affected as far as I can tell. The quiet parts are still quiet, and the loud parts are still loud, thankfully.\n\nThe two new tracks, \"Doom and Gloom\" and \"One More Shot,\" didn't do much for me initially, but the patented Stonesy sleazy swagger of both tracks is beginning to grow on me, as some of the band's best material have had to do in my case over the years (including almost all of 'Exile,' an undeniable masterpiece...not that I'm comparing). Within seconds of playing each song, there's no mistaking just who's performing them.\n\nThe one major negative about this set is that, like 'Forty Licks,' many of the tracks here are in edited form. I would have preferred to pay a few extra bucks for an extra disc if it meant getting the full versions, but considering this is a collection of their hits, which are usually presented in edited form on the radio anyway, this shouldn't be a huge deal to the casual fan, who are probably the main target of this release.\n\nEven though hardcore fans will own most of these songs already, it's still awesome to hear--with pristine sound--the progression of this inimitable band over the years, so I definitely recommend 'GRRR!' for both them and for those who just want the band's essential tracks in one place. It's amazing to think that the Stones are still going strong after 50 years, with no signs of letup in sight. To me, they are the perfect \"anytime\" band. Morning, noon, night, rain, snow, whether you're happy or sad, it's the perfect time for some Stones.\n\nThough they will probably always be known as the second greatest band of rock's golden age, no band defined--and still define--rock and roll like the Stones. They exude--ARE--rock and roll. And there's no better evidence than this collection.\n\n(*Edit--Someone in the comments section brought to my attention that the more recent remasters, such as 'Some Girls' and 'Sticky Fingers,' do contain clipping. I've compared many of the mid-late 60's tracks here with their 2002 remastered counterparts, and they appear the same to me, with no clipping. I'm not hearing any clipping on the 'Some Girls' and 'Sticky Fingers' tracks here either.)","classification":4,"fold":6}

This album is just as good, maybe better than the first. I can't think of one song on here I didn't like! Songs like \"Wash\", \"Anchor\", \"Out Of Breath\" and the hit \"Spin\" are extremely well written. How come radio won't play an excellent group like Lifehouse, but then they'll go cram Matchbox Twenty (a group who has gone progressivly downhill) down your throats?

Composed by someone who does not seriously understand what meditation needs.  Suggestive little \"ditties\" in an endless chain does not make for or assist meditation, on the contrary it is actuality a hindrance.  Meditation is a journey to endless personal simplification. Motionless, silent, unhindered, unending, evolving inner space where love, compassion and understanding permeate.  The second piece with passive waves and resonant tones would have been much better except for the interjection of vocals that are identifiable as a human mostly female voice.  In places the voice is almost acceptable but for most of the time it has to much personality and attitude.  The brain wave sync track is great.  The heavy breathing is ridiculous and distracting.

{"text":"While this album can't be called their apex, the Beatles end the early years with a bang here and an album with really only 1 poorish cut on it (\"It's Only Love\"). The beginnings of their musical experimentation can be seen here with the confessional tone of John's lyrics flowering on the title tune and \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\" which are not only classics in the Beatles lexicon but in all of rock and roll. Paul adds his own classic with \"Yesterday\" (which I believe is STILL the most covered rock song ever). Musically, there aren't a whole lot of \"breakthroughs\" here in terms of structure, but as a primer on how to write perfect 2 1\/2 minute pop songs there aren't many better CDs to study.\n\nHighlights are the somber \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\" with its wonderful flute solo, the charging pop of \"Help!\" (the perfect choice to open the album), the stately orchestral grace of \"Yesterday\"'s elegy to a love affair, \"Ticket to Ride\" is another melancholy ditty that's become a Beatles favourite, and underrated but fantastic \"I've Just Seen a Face\" has a  classical-ish guitar intro that gives way to a fast country shuffle. There are few hooks as infectious as the \"falling\" part of the tune, making it hard to believe it was allowed to languish as an album cut.\n\nThe bane of most of the early Beatles CDs is the cover tunes, but here Lennon turns in a jagged vocal on \"Dizzy Miss Lizzie\" and that, plus a \"Hippy Hippy Shake\" style George guitar, makes it a keeper if not a highlight.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Buying a \"hits\" CD for \"Help!\", \"Ticket to Ride\" and \"Yesterday\" isn't good enough. This isn't a track or two and some filler. Nearly every cut here is great. A must for every rock collection.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"December 2nd, 2009 (2:48 AM)\n\nIf you are behind the times like I was, GET INTO THIS TRACK. It is extremely hooky and even more catchy is the bridge which goes,\n\n\"Rock and Roll, baby\nDon't you know that\nWe're all alone now\nI need something to sing about\n\nRock and Roll (Hey!)\nDon't you know, baby\nWe're all alone now\nI need something to sing about\n\nRock and Roll (Hey!)\nDon't you know, baby\nWe're all alone now\nGive me something to sing about\"\n\nMight not look like much there, but it is extremely catchy.\n\nThe video must also be spoken of because although it's not super-glamorous or anything, it makes listening to the song even better. It features Hayley and the band just jammin' out, her at the mic and them on the drums and guitars just having fun in what looks like a desert.\n\nThe song itself is about a boy that Hayley is \"crushcrushcrushing\" on, and he's not there for her. Not until the bridge does he come into the picture as more than just one-way thoughts. But the song itself, I think talks about being alone and thinking of that someone that lights your fire, even if they aren't with you.\n\nWritten by Hayley Williams (lead singer) and Josh Farro (lead guitar\/backing vocals).\n\nDownload this track today!\n\n4 stars.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Five band members, over a dozen charting hit singles and twenty years of classically-composed, contemporarily-rendered melodies and musicality. They were part of an emerging trend of male R&B acts when they hit the scene in the early 90s (Boyz II Men, Blackstreet and Jodeci, to name a few), but as of today, the quintet stands apart as the sole self-contained band of their generation. No matter what trends were prevalent on the urban landscape, Mint Condition cemented their reputation and enduring fan base by utilizing an organic (some would say old-school) and multi-layered approach, which appears intermittently on their Shananchie Records debut and seventh CD, fittingly entitled 7. [Note: the version being reviewed does not include the additiona bonus tracks available at Best Buy]\n\nThe St. Paul, MN-based collective has always eschewed clichs---sex-starved lyrics, Auto-Tune and obligatory cameos by rappers-of-the-moment--- and on the tracks that find them at their best, Mint Condition is mesmerizingly modern and eclectic: a coolly duplicitous lover is put on blast in the edgy, up tempo \"Mindslicka\" (\"But when I found, every time, that you had another side\/and how did I, not realize that I just slipped on your ice again\"), and urgent, 80s-era funk is what sets apart the opener  \"Can't Get Away,\" conveying the angst of a man caught in the clutches of a toxic relationship: \"Now I'm here at home alone, he's with you doin', what I want to be doin'\/Maybe taking off your clothes, what can I do, gotta stop thinkin' about you.\"\n\nAnother set of stellar moments come in the form of ballads: the sinuous \"Caught My Eye\" crystallizes that electrical instant of attraction and the whispers of apprehension that follow: \"Very nice to meet ya, Girl I like your features\/maybe soon I could treat ya, to somewhere quiet no people\/Or maybe get to know ya, over a chai or mocha\/Saw you standing in line, Baby you caught my eye.\" The CD's most arresting vocal performance comes with the taut and tortured \"Walk Away,\" which displays the resonance of Stokley Williams' lower register that's typically only heard during live shows: \"Shame, this time it's all on me, the first time, you were to blame\/We both don't we don't work, I should expect results, the same\/So you don't need to get no closer, don't try to put that thang on me....\" \"Not My Daddy\" pairs Mr. Williams with the delicately nuanced alto of Kelly Price, their vocals pitch-perfect and the band's instrumentality a climactic component as the two convey a couple battling archaic expectations in their relationship: \"Trust, without it there's no love. It's true no matter what you try....I spy, you seek, you watch, I peek, so what are we doing with our love? It's not how it's supposed to be.\"\n\nWhile the rest of their songs still eclipse the majority of what can pass for R&B these days (such as the tender, piano-anchored tribute, \"Unsung,\" and the hip-hop-helmed \"7\", which cleverly intertwines titles from their many hits into a smooth, spoken word soliloquy), some of them seem robotically rendered or creatively truncated: \"20 Years Later,\" for example, echoes the fury and chaos that a struggling drug addict feels as his life veers out of control (\"Now I'm with another friend's ex, told her she can't call, he's my roommate, would be drama, but really, I'm married, just turned 47, and I now I'm back here with my mama\"), but it dissipates without lyrical or emotional closure. \"I Want It\" is catchy, but beneath their skill set, and what could've been an arresting instrumental, \"Bossalude,\" hovers somewhere between perky and pedestrian.\n\nSimply put, 7 doesn't touch the scope of 2005's Livin' the Luxury Brown, and compared to 2008's eLife,certain tracks feel...well....rushed (not exactly sloppy, but undercooked and free of marinate). More than appealing for the casual fan and worthy enough, if not wonderful, for their most ardent FOOMS (the band's acronym for Friends Of Our Music), Mint Condition's seventh CD may update the band's modus operandi, but listeners who crave their unique artistry will wish that they didn't do so by leaving much of their trademark instrumentation behind.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Admittedly, I was a little disappointed that the new stereo mixes of tracks such as \"I Get Around,\" \"Good Vibrations,\" and \"Help Me, Rhonda\" were not included, but that was probably because Brian Wilson wanted the monos included on the hits packages.

{"text":"When it has came down to music this past year from female artists, it has lagged in heart and voice, and left behind by cheapness and poor taste from artists like Rihanna and Miley Cyrus. Yet, they have had poor taste in voice and heart. But there needs to be better balance. For newcomers like Lorde, she has a lot to prove, especially trying to follow up what British divas like Adele and Amy Winehouse have done so nicely. Her breakthrough single Royals is actually a very catchy song. I like the rhythm and simplicity of the song. It really lingers in what this past year showed with bad music, but good taste from Lorde. It definitely is better than joke songs like Blurred Lines or Wrecking Ball. Hopefully, there will be more good music from Lorde soon. She should have great songs, and shouldn't be labeled as a one-hit-wonder.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"A stunning, visionary album that encapsulates every one of Browne's several talents perfectly. Step aside, Abbey Road, this is my new favorite album. Miles ahead of its time, maturely written, and packed with classics even someone living on Jupiter will have heard, this is... ha! I fooled you, didn't I? This album really gets 2.5 stars. I just thought it would be funny if I ever gave anything by Mr. Browne the highest possible score. Anyway, this is slightly better than the debut, containing a whopping five good songs rather than four. I don't think you need me here to tell you that \"Take It Easy\" is better heard here than by the Eagles (Jackson wrote the damn thing); \"Redneck Friend\" is easily the best of his few rockers, and its sense of humor is a nice change of pace from his usual overtly-serious style; \"For Everyman\" is a bit overlong but has the best guitar solo Browne ever recorded; \"These Days\" (later covered by Gregg Allman) goes from country-rock to relatively full-on rock; and the slow-building \"I Thought I Was a Child\" is interesting too. But some of it's more of the same, just one turgid country-rocker after another - \"Our Lady of the Well\", \"Ready or Not\", etc. Better than the debut, at least.

{"text":"My title is kind of blunt isn't it?  However, the bottom line is that Arc Of A Diver is one medicore recording loaded with excessive synthesizer tones and lacking much in the order of good melodies.\nThe first two songs are clearly the cream of this crop.  I will even say that While You See A Chance is one of Steve Windwood's best songs of all time.  The words are quite soothing and the melody is extremely captivating.  The instrumental accompanyment is very appropriate.  Also, the very next track, Arc Of A Diver, is quite ear friendly with a strong melody and good special effects.\nAfter this strong opening, the rest of the record is quite dissappointing.  The remaining songs tend to drag within a few minutes.  Several of these so-called tunes even exceede the six minute mark in length with barely a distinguishable melody.  Guitars, natural sounding keyboards, and a driving drumbeat are almost non-existent.\nDear Listener, you are best served to pursue Steve Windwood's Traffic career.  These tunes feature some good instrumental definition and some compelling melodies.  Stevie's Back In The High Life is a considerable better effort as many of the tunes on that release are quite stylish.  On this record, you have the great two song opener, two more passable tunes(Spanish Dancer, Night Train) and an overabundance of synthesizer drivel that at least to my ears is not worth the investment.","classification":2,"fold":6}

{"text":"Since the days of those well reminded years in which LP format commanded the market I bought this fabulous set: impressive and astounding all the way through. Michael Ponti is part of the legend of piano. In his debut on Carnegie hall in 1972, he was labeled like \"the Horowitz of the new generations\". Winner of the coveted Busoni Prize in 1964, and owner of an enviable expressiveness, demolishing technique, sheer lyricism and enraptured poetry, no other Western pianist has established such ravishing committment with the Russian piano literature like him: as a matter of fact, he recorded Scriabin's and Tchaikovsky's complete piano music, without including Mili Balakirev, Anton Rubinstein, Nikolai Medtner or Nikolai Rimski Korsakov, for instance. And today when all of us are well aware about the awful stroke (late nineties) that avoided Mr. Ponti to use his right arm this legacy confirms why he was one of the most genuine Ambassadors of the most variegated pianistic repertoire you may imagine.\n\nHis approach with Rachmaninoff is mesmerizing. Works such as the Sonata No. 1 Op. 13, Sonata No. 2 Op. 28, Morceaux Op. 10, Six Musical Moments Op. 16 were performed  with such degree of conviction and intelectual honesty that it will leave you amazed. Beyond the fact Sviatoslav Richter achieved an unsurpassed pinnacle with Rachmaninov's piano music (Olympia Records), we have the chance to listen a sincere, zealous performed and idiomatic Rachmaninov without cheap sentimentalism. There are several highlights such as Corelli variations or variations on a Chopin's theme. Frankly speaking, this is a real collector item under any angle you regard it.\n\nDon't let pass this unique opportunity to listen and enjoy at last the integral pianistic literature of this Russian icon of the first half of the XX Century and perhaps the last Romantic composer.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I don 't have any of my best headphones on this computer, I'm using a headset, but the combined re-mix, Analog to Digital Converters, mastering technique, most of these songs sound even better to me now. I bought just about ever CD that the Delfonics released since CD's first came out ($600 for a CD player then), because something was missing or not in stereo on that CD. Most of these re-mixes are very clean, and again I'll have to replace 90% of the Delfonics songs on my MP3 player with these. What stood out to me was the first recordings were made at the old Cameo-Parkway building, which later became Philly International on Broad street, but when Sigma was opened in 1968, and the Delfonics started recording there, you can really hear on these CD's the voices of Thom Bell if you know it, with the background vocals, until he stopped producing them. The horns sound fantastic, especially Joe (the lips) D, and on The Delfonics theme near the end, I could have sworn that was Lenny Pakula on the organ making that sound alone, but now I hear a Kettle drum roll with him that I never hear before with this cheap headset, I had to backup to make sure I wasn't hearing things. Next I'll play this CD I'll use my good phones, or through speakers. It's hard to believe some of these recordings are 49 years old. Any disappointments? Yes, just 3 for me. Can't get over Losin' you; was remixed in mono, \"I gave to you\"; was not the extended version, and the extended version I do have is one of the worst mix out there of the song, so I'm still looking. \"Didn't I blow you Mind\", was the only song that the band recorded live together, and I love strings, but they leaked into Earls drum set and had to be lowered, and it's the only Delfonics record where the strings are too low for me, though this version is better than any previous ones, the strings are to far in the mix and I was expecting a miracle I guess. I got the CD on the 1st day it was released and I'm glad I bought it. I'm no expert, but some of these songs sound like they recorded at a higher digital rate. If you have these Delfonic songs on a CD already, you may not notice any difference, but if you have pretty good ears or thought you knew every note or sound in these songs and want the best versions of these song recorded, then this is a must buy. I don't know if this guy had the original tapes to work with, but he somehow got rid of the musicians talking in the beginning of; \"Think about me baby\", and someone's enthusiasm on \"Trying to make a fool of me\" after the music intro, maybe Thom Bell? I give the album a A.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Of Dylan's three Christian albums, ascetically this is the best.  SAVED is flat and has too clich to have any true impact for the listener.  SHOT OF LOVE, while having some brilliant moments (although, unfortunately, most of the brilliant moments were left OFF that particular album), never really fully gelled to the vision Dylan seemed to want to take it.  SHOT OF LOVE filled like it was supposed to be a Christian pop album, merging the best of both art forms into a cohesive whole.  When it worked, it really worked (\"Every Grain of Sand.\")  When it didn't, SHOT OF LOVE just sinks.\nAnd what of SLOW TRAIN COMING?  Well, like SHOT OF LOVE, only half of this record truly gels into truly great material.  The first four songs on Side 1 start the album really strong.  Judging from the momentum these songs have, SLOW TRAIN COMING should have a really strong finish, and would have been one of his best albums.  Sadly, Dylan stalls halfway through the album and as a result SLOW TRAIN COMING is greatly weakened.  The rest of the album becomes craftsmanship instead of art.\nThat, perhaps, is the best identifier for SLOW TRAIN COMING.  Dylan's obviously focused on these tracks, and you can tell he wants the album to have a contemporary sound (hence Knopler and his gang).  The first four tracks show's Dylan's brilliance in a Christian context.  The remaining five show Dylan in a focused, workman-like determination to come up with a collection of songs that reflect his new found faith.  While there's nothing particularly wrong with these tracks, there's nothing particularly right with them either.\nInstead of placing the highlights throughout the album, as he did with STREET-LEGAL and SHOT OF LOVE, Dylan chose to put all the good stuff at the beginning.  Perhaps the reason for this is to win sympathy for the album and to carry the record through to the end, but for this listener I just want to push stop and eject after the first four tracks have gone by.  The listening frustration is more intense on SLOW TRAIN COMING because of this fact.  When Dylan strikes gold, he really hits it big time.  The rest just appear as songs that anyone could have written, and sometimes the dogma makes for rather odd songs (\"Man Gave Names To All The Animals\").  \"Man\" is the most interesting track off the second side and that is because it's so strange and musically it's reggae.  Other than that, while Dylan's commitment to his faith and his desire to channel this faith into his art is indeed an admirable cause, in the end there's only about a side here worth really looking at.  The rest are good, just a long way from the brilliance of the first four cuts.\nAs the first album in the Christian Trilogy, it is the best.  The contrast between the brilliant tracks and the just so tracks becomes much more apparent in SHOT OF LOVE than SLOW TRAIN COMING.  The worst material on here still stands as serviceable tracks, just not brilliant tracks.  SHOT OF LOVE, however, is cluttered with material that just barely makes the cut ascetically, yet the brilliant stuff of that album is even better than the first four songs here, so the extremes are more fully realised on SHOT OF LOVE than on SLOW TRAIN COMING.  As for \"Every Grain of Sand,\" nothing here matches that, but that is only one song and one song cannot make an album (listen to \"In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida\" for proof).  We won't even talk about SAVED.\n In relation to STREET-LEGAL, this album seemed to be a natural progression.  Dylan is always one for trying something different and new.  Lyrically, there are cuts on STREET-LEGAL is on rival with the best of his 1960s material.  The last cut (\"Where are You Tonight? (Journey Through Dark Heat)\") shows Dylan struggling to find something in his life worth caring about.  Here is the answer to that question.\nBottom line:  Dylan getting religion, while spiritually the most important thing a person can do, only results in fair material with some brilliant moments.  Of his three Christian albums, this is the one to get.  Just like his three longer albums (BLONDE ON BLONDE, SELF-PORTRAIT, and TIME OUT OF MIND), the middle one in this trilogy is an absolute disaster area.  Get SLOW TRAIN COMING, then SHOT OF LOVE, and if you really feel you need to own SAVED, well, go ahead.  Don't say I didn't warn you though.\nMike London\nP. S.

{"text":"The Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson is a compelling alternative rock song that I first heard as a teenager in the 1990s (from both local radio and television).  I take this songs meaning to symbolize the singers way of truthfully admitting that we do live in a world where many people are prejudged (even outside of Hollywood)based on physical appearance\/weight.  This song actually creeped into my dreams as an adult after I reluctantly accepted that I must get a handle on my weight not just for health reasons but reasons having to do with getting a job and how my value as a woman may be perceived (whether I like it or not). I took this song being in my dream as an intuitive warning to accept that reality that I just mentioned without feeling self-pity (I prefer to avoid public sharing when I had that dream). Nonetheless, The Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson is a rock song with depth that explores a persons journey to greatness without letting the physical appearance judgements consume them.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"For the most part that's what the cd and John Legend do.  I was really interested in this one for a couple reasons, one i'm a fan and two of the inclusion of a more upbeat style on a few songs this time around.\n\nI love his music and everything but sometimes all the slow songs tend to get mushed together and that's not to say.  I don't enjoy them because i do, but i like that he finally switches up the tempo and gets out and enjoys himself.\n\nWith \"Green Light\" Feat Andre 3000, its something so far from the norm that some folks might be shocked.  Don't be he rocks the song and the beat is crazy of course we have Andre being himself with some crazy lyrics (minus the \"giggling like a piglet\" part) of course.  For me the songs that he has featured artists are the ones that i really find myself wanting to hear again.\n\n\"No Other Love\" with Estelle (who's a promising singer\/rapper from the UK and with a hit or two of her own).  This is one is a straight slow jam that works well as John and Estelle trade off lines about wanting no other love but each other.\n\n\"It's Over\" with Kanye West, it wouldnt be a John Legend cd without him as they work well together and this song is no exception to that rule either.\n\n\"Quickly\" with Brandy.  Another of favorite female singers, Brandy fits in nicely on this slow down track as well.  Making it one of the ones i most enjoy hearing when i play this cd...welcome back girl.  John does his thing on the track with the lyrics and talented instrument playing as always.\n\nWhile \"Evolver\" is different than his previous effort \"Once Again\".  Its by no means a bad thing, because as we can tell.  Mr. Legend will continue evolving throughout his musical career. I for one plan on being their all the while enjoying it all.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Last May, I discovered Tenth Avenue North's debut and fell in love with their encouraging lyrics and fun music.  I've been looking forward to their follow up, The Light Meets The Dark.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't live up to their debut.\n\nWith this release, Tenth Avenue North has firmly established themselves on the pop side of the pop\/rock genre.  In fact, I would be hard pressed to call any of the songs on this disc as rock.  There are some upbeat tracks, but for the most part, things pretty much seem to be on an even keel.  And that's my biggest problem with this disc.  The songs all start to sound the same after a while.\n\nThe lyrics on the first disc were moving and inspirational.  Here, they don't seem quite as deep, even bordering on cliche.  That's even worse to me since the lyrics are usually what make or break a release for me.\n\nThere are some good tracks here.  For example, disc opener \"Healing Begins\" is a nice mid-tempo number that reminds us that we won't truly heal until we accept God's forgiveness.  The verses talk about how all our trying won't do any good.  It starts out rather quiet and slow, but it picks up in both volumn and tempo when they reach the first chorus.  You can even hear some strings in the midst of the guitar and drums.  It really does give me a sense of freedom to remember that God knows my faults and has forgiven them.\n\nThey up the tempo with the next track, \"Strong Enough to Save.\"  This track is on the rock side of the spectrum, especially on the chorus, with the loud guitar and strong drum beat.  It follows up the theme of the first track by reminding us that the God who controls nature is strong enough to save us.\n\n\"The Trust is Who You Are\" uses guitar to remind us that our belief in God needs to actually affect how we live.  Once again, we've got a guitar driven song that starts slow and builds to mid-tempo by the chorus.\n\nAnother favorite track is the disc closer.  \"Oh My Dear\" is a piano driven ballad.  The longest track here, it's absolutely beautiful to listen to.  The lyrics are pretty powerful as well.  They're written from the point of view of a person who goes over to help a friend who is going through a very rough patch, mainly due to sins of the past.  The forgiveness and love shown are convicting and heartwarming at the same time.\n\nThere are a couple songs that I find annoying because of the lyrics.  \"On and On\" is written from God's point of view as He reminds us of His love and sacrifice for us.  It's got a great piano and strings background that is pretty.  It's an upbeat ballad that could really deliver a powerful wallop.  Yet it leaves me feeling cold because the lyrics cover ground they've done better in other songs on their two discs.\n\nThen there's \"House of Mirrors.\"  And upbeat guitar track, it challenges us to break the mirror of our pasts and focus on what God has done for us.  Again, it's something they've covered before and the chorus is just so simple.  I've heard prediction it will be a concert favorite, and I think that will be the case because the simple chorus will be easy to shout out, but it doesn't make for a good song on a CD.\n\nFrankly, this is one of those discs I think I will enjoy best in bits and pieces.  The songs are okay by themselves, so as they come through iTunes shuffle or some such program, I will enjoy hearing them.  But when I sit down and listen to them back to back, I find them lyrically and musically repetitive.\n\nI really did want to like The Light Meets The Dark.  Tenth Avenue North has a gift for putting familiar truths into fresh, encouraging packages.  But the repetitive nature of the songs here makes it only average.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I would hear Kem on the radio, mostly on the stations which focused on playing jazz music and said to myself, \"This is just where this artist belongs\". I liked his voice from the first time I was introduced to it. It's very unique and befitting for jazz. It has been a long time since I have heard Kem on the radio, but something just compelled me to pick up his debut album and listen closely; I'm glad I did.\n\nPlease be warned: The younger generation may not like or appreciate this album. For example, when I was listening to this album, my brother gave me a crazy look and said, \"What the hell are you listening to?\" On the contrast, my older sister heard me playing the LP and said, \"You know about Kem? I didn't know you liked Kem!\" I really don't want to limit him to a particular audience, by this really is grown folks music. There is not one up-tempo song  in sight, just slow jams and mid-tempos. Everyone doesn't always like fast music anyway; I'm one of them. I can easily appreciate an album comprised of quiet storm tracks especially since radio plays almost all upbeat music. I get so tired of it, I hardly ever listen to the radio nowadays. \"Love Calls\" was the first single from \"Kemistry\" and what a fantastic song it is! Kem makes sure that he croons women and gives the fellers something to think about. This song is very laid back and mellow; it's sure to put one in a romantic mindset. Also, the lyrics are really good. He's letting the listening know that when love calls, there is no where to hide. \"Inside\" and \"Cherish this Moment\" are fine moments on the album.

{"text":"The music left behind by the great, criminally-overlooked vocalist Steve Marriott is so full of life and sass that it's hard to think of his story as the tragedy it really was. He was the voice behind some of the greatest pop (Small Faces) and rock (Humble Pie) ever recorded, but his career was marred almost from start to finish by such horrendously exploitive business management that in his later years Marriott was often destitute, if not heavily in debt. For the last couple of years of his life, you could find Marriott playing in bars around England, just to pay the rent. That's a long way to fall from the glory days of Humble Pie, from which this song comes. \"30 Days\" and \"I Don't Need No Doctor\" are the Pie's classic rock radio staples, reminders of what a great band they were, and what a great singer we lost when Marriott literally went up in flames (he died in a house fire). What I'll always remember about his is how, no matter how bad things got towards the end, Marriott would just laugh, shrug, maybe flip the bird, strap on a guitar and just carry on rocking.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Hard to believe that it has been over 4 years since Michael Jackson sadly passed away the way he died. It is still one of the most surreal deaths of all time, and shows the heartbreak he had to go through in death, and how his music has reminded so many people we've dealt with the demise of a legend. His biggest album and musical moment will always be the acclaimed Thriller. The title track shows how the music scene was changed dramatically in the 80's and over 30 years later it still is a thrill to the moment hearing the rhythmic track with Vincent Price over the song well. It is a haunting song that still captures for any die hard Michael Jackson fan. It is a great song to listen to and a must download for your music library.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Well, theres now two collaborative CDs released this year which are already easily worthy of Top Albums of the Year list praise.  While Randy Rogers and Wade Bowen put out an album celebrating a friendship and musical kinship of fifteen years, Merle and Willie have done the same thing, celebrating a friendship and musical kinship thats about three times that long.\n\nThis is a masterful album.  While the partnership of Willie and Waylon is arguably more famous than this partnership, to cast any kind of dispersion on the friendship of these two legends would be an insult.\n\nTheres not a bad moment on this fourteen track collection.  Not a single chord, not a single note, not a single lyric is wasted.\n\nBut thats not to say there aren't some true standout tracks, either.  Unfair Weather Friend is a song that will remind many of Find Out Who Your Friends Are by Tracy Lawrence, Tim McGraw, and Kenny Chesney.  The themes explored in this song are a long lasting friendship, two friends who can count on each other for anything and everything, and have throughout the years.  While Find Out explored this type of friendship in the broad aspects of hypotheticals, Unfair Weather Friend is two friends speaking directly to one another  expressing gratitude for the friendship theyve shared over the years.\n\nMissing Ol Johnny Cash is a fun track where these two discuss their love for the Man in Black.  Rather than a lament, the song is sung with the utmost joy for the late legend, for both his music and his offstage behavior  the Johnny Cash that only his friends knew, even telling a great story (be it true or not) about Cash taking a casket to his hotel room, climbing inside, and calling room service.\n\nLive This Long is another great track where the two greats sing about how they would have taken it easier and given up more vices had they known they were going to live as long as they had.  Another standout is the cover of Dylans Dont Think Twice, Its All Right, a Dylan track Ive always loved.\n\nIf theres one complaint, its that the album goes way too quickly.  When legends put out new material, especially in the current country music environment, theres always a desire for the music not to end.  Fourteen tracks is a good length of album from any artist, but when icons are putting out new music, when you don't know when you might hear from them again in the future, you're always left wanting more when the album ends.  Especially with an album as solid as this one.  (I suppose that this can hardly be considered a complaint since no one can expect that the album would be endless).\n\nOverall, this album is a must-own for any true country music fan.\n\nFollow opinions on country music at hopeforcountrymusic.weebly.com","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I think the reviewer who calls this Brahms Fourth a dud is overstating the case. Szell never falls below the high standard of execution that made the Cleveland Orch. world class, so ensemble and balances are perfect. But for some reason he seems dispirited. The opening movement, whose first theme sounds disjointed here, doesn't soar: it's just one note after the other. This literalness is even more apparent in the slow movement, which seems to be sleepwalking.\n\nI was shocked, given that Szell generally followed Toscanini's model in Brahms, which is swift and tense. The Scherzo catches a spark or two, but the phrasing remains foursquare rather than flowing or exciting. When the finale arrived and I heard the opening bars played with every chord at the same volume, with no attempt to express the shape of Brahms's great passacaglia, I gave up. From college I remember Szell's Academic Festival Over. being one of the best, and it has more sprightly energy than the symphony by a long shot; recording and inner detail are marvelous also. But you'd never guess that Brahms had written a celebratory piece. Likewise, the Tragic Over., which is the best thing on this budget CD, is forceful and well recorded but short on real tragedy.\n\nIn all, this is the least successful installment in Szell's Brahms cycle, which includes a riveting First and Third.","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"Weezer never seems to go away. Just when you think they're done with music, they come back with something better than their last. And this time, they might have just topped themselves. When I first heard the song, I didn't care that much for it. It all just seemed too weird, and culinary disgusting, \"I eat my candy with the pork and beans.\" But then I saw the music video, which is a freakin' awesome tribute to YouTube and pop culture, complete with comedy, and cool effects, and everybody appears as themselves in the video. You'll see \"Numa Numa\" guy, and 'Miss I Don't Know Why People Don't Have Maps.'\n\nLyrically, the song and the video go hand in hand, where it celebrates the difference of everybody, which is what YouTube is supposed to be all about. Musically, it's pretty good modern rock material, and apparently so. There's the booming guitars, the vocals, and the catchy hooks.\n\nAnd again, if you haven't seen the video, do yourself a favor, and do so. It's must-see TV. And it really compliments and drives the song, instead of the other way around. Favorite Part: The Mentos in Coke Fountain Show. The only thing that they could have done better in the video is add Lonleygirl15 to the beginning squares, instead of \"Numa Numa\" guy, and save him for his great part later.\n\nOverall, the song is good, not great. Pretty good modern rock, although it doesn't blow me aways by itself. But add the video, and everything changes. And the video is already headed toward the YouTube hall of fame on its own. And the song may end up as one of the most successful of 2008, at least in Modern Rock.\n\nReal Score: 4.5","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Really surprised by this album. In fact honestly,if I'd actually only listened to it half way and than shut it off I wouldn't see it as meriting a review at all. During the last couple of years I've seen the emergence of a series of albums by contemporary R&B female artists that I'd describe as \"high concept\" releases. Some are extremely successful both in creative and commercial terms. Janelle Monae's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-ArchAndroid\/dp\/B002ZFQD0E\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The ArchAndroid<\/a>&nbsp;is a perfect example. And that appears to be what Chrisette Michele was going for on her third release. Her first two albums. In her liner notes the concept is abundantly clear. She's decided to address the troubles of the modern day recording industry such as the obsession with surface value and resulting creative crisis's. On that end it's apparent that she has found herself in the middle of one. She isn't sure if the jazzy R&B\/funk direction is for her after all. And seems to be changing her mind about her adventure. It all comes into her commentary. You'd think with an album with such a worthy and lofty mission that it would be a masterpiece. It didn't turn out quite that way.\n\n  For one thing there's one simple contradiction. Much in the same way Funkadelic one proclaimed they were \"rescuing dance music from the blahs\",this album definitely has a similar concept. The problem comes because a lot of the music embraces many of the ideas it's supposed to protect people from. Songs such as \"I'm A Star\",\"I Don't Know Why,But I Do\" and \"The Goodbye Game\" all embrace just about every contemporary hip-hop\/R&B cliche one can imagine. The bassy techno strains of \"So Cool\" is even more puzzling at first. It isn't until you listen to some of the other songs do you find out why they are there. There is a title song and it is one of the strongest songs on here. Featuring Talib Kweli it's a powerful modern funk message song speaking about the hypocrisy of modern society,especially in dealing with matters of race and national defense. In an era when topical songs are extremely rare,this really speaks volumes. Another important song is the epic \"If Nobody Sang Along\". And THAT'S when the commerciality of some of the other songs is explained. As in the liner notes she's filled with a lot of doubt,contemplating selling out for further popularity or sticking to her guns.\n\n  As anyone who reads my reviews a lot know I am not a \"cranky reviewer\". In fact anything below a four star review is very rare for me these days. The only reason I do so here is because Chrisette Michele is someone whose creative integrity I respect and trust. I completely understand and relate to her conception on this album. And I also support the fact she HAS a concept that's socially relevant. A friend of mine from Oakland had a conversation with me a few years ago about how critical people have become with music and film these days. His contention was that today's trouble was there WASN'T ENOUGH analytical criticism of these art forms in these day and age. That they were all seen as conventional media,little more than commercials and not looked into with more of a fine toothed comb. This album really helps me understand that. The modern cliche's she embraced,even in irony didn't add up to a creatively potent album. The fact she subdued her excellent vocal ability on these tunes didn't help either. If she'd extended the albums two best songs into a full cinematic album concept ala&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/What-s-Going-On\/dp\/B00007FOMP\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">What's Going On<\/a>&nbsp;or Curtis Mayfield's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Back-to-the-World\/dp\/B000B9WDIW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Back to the World<\/a>&nbsp;it would've been an easy successor to her previous two triumphs. Unfortunately,as it stands this is her most creatively erratic album thus far. Chrisette Michele is still,however a talented lady. Better luck from this point on! She deserves it!","classification":2,"fold":6}

{"text":"It isn't hard to say that this is a good album, it fact, it is not hard to say this album is nothing short of a masterpiece.  India. Arie delivers a brilliant sophomore album entitled, \"Voyage to India\".  In fact, if this album was really a \"voyage\" to somewhere, many would probably pay top dollar to be there!\n\n This is such a positive album.  The lyrics just make any listener smile.  Anyone who knows anything about India knows she loves to play the guitar, and it is evident that she loves the guitar when listening to her album.  There is a guitar in every song on the album.  Although I think she's a bit indulgent with the guitar, she doesn't bore the listener with it.  It actually sounds right nice and adds something distinctive to her album.\n\n \"Good Man\" is definitely an album highlight.  The lyrics are meaningful and real.  The song is about a man who has children and if anything ever happens to him, he wants his children to know he loved them and that he was a good man.  Many parents can relate to this song because it's the same way they feel about their children.  \"Talk to Her\" has one of those beats you can snap your fingers and bob your head to.  Aside from the laid back beat, the song offers a very relevant message in today's world; talk to women with respect (men).  This song has simple lyrics, but they say so much.  I love it!  \"God is Real\" is another one of the many beautiful songs on \"Voyage to India\".  This song has a very noticeable guitar in the background.  India's vocals are really good on this track, they help the song to be more believable.  The song is about questioning the existence of God.  India does an excellent job of stating her claim of why she thinks or as she says \"knows\" that God is real.  \"Can I Walk With You\" and \"The One\" are just nice love songs.  India's vocals are, again, on point for these tracks.  If anyone were to ask me to pick to tracks to listen to on this album, I'd go with these.  The album contains no fillers, just brilliant work by a great artist of today.  If debating on whether or not to cop this one, GET IT NOW!  India will take you by surprise, like she did men.  I am very impressed with the talent of this woman.  She's a shining star! 5 star album!\n\nMiKeisha's Top 5\n\n1. Good Man\n\n2. The One\n\n3. Can I Walk With You?\n\n4. Talk to her\n\n5.

Pure AM radio, pure 1975.\n\nThat opening bass thump is distinctive, then that popping rhythm guitar comes in and you know exactly what song this is--there is no other like it.  And as the song winds and builds through the verses, you've got that subtle yet powerful string backing helping out the rhythm, taking this song from guitar-based pop rock in the direction of Philadelphia soul and well into funky.  This is 70s pop, all the way.\n\nThis is a great party song as its call-and-response structure lends it to group participation, whether you know the lyrics or not.  The lyrics--well, they're about man and woman, mutual attraction, and his offer to her to step right up and just git some.  It's an exulting, happy song, infectious, from beginning to end.\n\nFor those of you who sat through&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Postman\/dp\/B001OKJU5G\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Postman<\/a>, you'll remember that this tune got a nice little acoustic cover in that peaceful campfire scene.

The album has also been digitally remastered and neatly repackaged as a 2-disc set.\n\nWhere the original album was sweetened with orchestral overdubs and didn't include the Rev. James Cleveland's spoken words, here the focus is on documenting the event itself and presenting the music as it was actually heard live (Aretha's Baptist minister dad, the Rev. C. L. Franklin, also speaks). It's a welcome change, too; the communal spirit of hope, love and appreciation that beams from this congregation in response to these inspiring performances adds so much here.\n\nIt quickly becomes very clear that Aretha's performance was much more than entertainment for this audience. The spiritual enthusiasm that is at times powerfully contagious is at other times overwhelmingly humbling. The sweet serenity of Marvin Gaye's Wholy Holy contrasts the jumping gospel energy of How I Got Over and the funky soul beat of Mary Don't You Weep. This stuff ROCKS!\n\nHighlights include a compelling extended version of Precious Memories (with the Rev. James Cleveland) and an epic fourteen-minute rendition of Amazing Grace. Aretha is at the top of her game here, doing what she was obviously born to do. She lights up these gospel classics with heartfelt clarity and bursts of melodious soul-screaming that could make Amy Winehouse and Christine Aguilera blush. She really shows 'em how it's done here.\n\nThe Southern California Community Choir is an essential element in this recording, and their wonderful performance provides a moving and deeply textured backdrop that holds things together magnificently.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Amazing-Grace-The-Complete-Recordings\/dp\/B00000IPY3\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Amazing Grace: The Complete Recordings<\/a>&nbsp;is a modern, more historically accurate and inspiring take on one of the greatest and best-selling gospel recordings in history. It's almost impossible not to be moved while listening to this album, and Aretha Franklin's talent, spirit and charisma are in full bloom in this pure and most genuine of musical settings. Amazing, indeed!\n\n\"The only man that walks alone is a man that has no God...\"","classification":5,"fold":6}

There not bad songs  (the 80's was when I started buying rock LPs), it's just than there was no financial constrictions or record company pressure in the making of this record, so Harris could have created something ambitious & original (just because it's a rock album, doesn't mean your not allowed break the mode)\nWhat would have been nice, if every song had a different vocalist, musicians & ever producer, to create a richly textured album, almost like a heavy metal version of \"Screamadelica\".\nI think if the band toured the songs for 6 months before recording it, the album may have evolved a little.\nI know you can say that this just Harris letting his hair down & having some fun with his friends, but you still have to pay full price for the album.\nSo unfortunately I would file this under \"disappointing side project\".","classification":3,"fold":6}

{"text":"Steve decides too late that he needs an answer to Maiden member's solo projects and Bruce Dickinson's Skunkworks album, and so he goes from the Maiden \"prog\" to 90s alternative. The path to this is simple. Get \"inspiration\" from any numerous average bands pretending to be fresh floating around today, get an average typical sounding singer of today to sing the same post grunge meets Disney\/r&b melodies. Write the average songs. Then spend many years polishing the average songs to try and play it as if it hasn't been done before. For the finishing touch, sprinkle a few of your trademarks on the top and put your household name on it.\n\nOn an interesting note, there's only two songs over 6 minutes, truly a feat, not easily accomplished, for Mr. Harris! The final song The Lesson is a well written song.\n\nIt's nice to see Harris do things out of the normal Maiden mold, but apparently he has no good ideas either inside or outside of Maiden. Given that reality, maybe the next bright step might be to write a biography.","classification":2,"fold":6}

The American version of Cher's \"Living Proof\" contains quite a few danceable little ditties and a lot of smooth production.  It also contains Cher's curious choice of song lyrics (she only wrote one of the songs) and her somewhat annoying singing voice (only topped (again! haha!!) by her annoying speaking voice and the insipid things she says).  The problem with that particular album is she sings in a language Hoppy can understand (English!).  This Japanese version is much much better.  I can't understand a thing the crone is saying, but I can still dance dance dance my pants off!  For those who love Cher's new dance beat, but don't like listening to her silly platitudes, this is the choice for you.  Well worth the extra expense.

{"text":"Sometimes in the world of metal a person wants the real deal - while black, prog, death, etc. all have their strengths and weaknesses, it's a good thing there are still metal outfits out there who are the foundation of the genre that helps to keep it somewhat centered, as many nowadays have gone the route of metalcore, with screaming, tuneless and hookless guitar noises, blast beat drums that destroy any sense of tempo and melody.\n  Metal Church are veterans of the U.S. early '80s scene that fostered the thrash movement, the Big 4 and other worthy outfits who didn't reach the commercial heights of the Big 4, but in many cases were much better.  Metal Church was a Seattle contribution to the era, had ties with Metallica, even loaning one time lead guitarist John Marshall to substitute for James Hetfield, who had injured his arm and temporarily was unable to play guitar.\n  Kurt Vanderhoof remains the last original member, but was the founder and principle songwriter, so the Metal Church sound remains intact.  That sound is one part thrash, a couple parts Judas Priest, and is about as no frills straight up classic metal as you can get.  After original vocalist David Wayne left, and later died, Mike Howe entered the picture with a couple great albums, \"Blessing in Disguise\" and \"The Human Factor\" among them.  He left, other band members departed, but now he's back with Vanderhoof for XI, a grand return to form for these metal veterans.\n  His voice is strong, has its own unique tone, and the band burn with the intensity of past glories like \"Metal Church\", one of the great underrated metal anthems from the first album, \"Ton of Bricks\" and \"The Final Word\", thrashing headbangers if there ever were any.  A better production this time around, the energy that has rekindled this band and some fine songwriting and hooks make \"XI\" a damn good album - jackhammer rhythms, some really cool hooks, like \"Signal Path\" and tight playing make one wonder why these guys, like lots of other outfits including Laaz Rockit, Forbidden, and Whiplash couldn't have had the breaks they deserved, but we can right one wrong by getting this latest from a good batch of metal warriors.","classification":5,"fold":6}

I was hoping for some heavier songs that are similar to those on the Phobia record. Dark Before Dawn reminds me a lot of Saturate in terms of vocals. The best song, in my opinion, is Ashes of Eden. It's very powerful and emotional, definitely a must-listen. Angels Fall and Breaking the Silence are also some great ones!

Beautiful people, religion, musicians, music fans, flower children, young gods playing 'music born of love.' (yeah, free love, groovy). Then, dig the roll call and the musical tributes:\n\n1) The Byrds and the (Jefferson) Airplane did fly.\n2) Ravi Shankar's music made Eric cry...Waaah! there there, Eric. Here are some love beads for you.\n3) The Who exploded into fire and light...\n4) Hugh Masekela's music was black as night (he's still alive and making great music!)\n5) The Grateful Dead (noodling around music)\n6) Jimi Hendrix set the world on fire...wow, he sure did!\n7) His majesty Prince (Brian) Jones, wearing appropriate renaissance fair garb, smiled benevolently at all his loyal tripped-out hippie subjects. Hear ye hear ye!\n\n10,000 electric guitars...hmmm, I don't remember that from the movie, was that during the Association's set? haha.\nEven the cops grooved with us! I used to think the line was 'even the cops drew quivers.' As though they were dressed up like Robin Hood's merry men, with toy bows and arrows. Hey, you know Eric would not lie.

{"text":"Mary J. Blige continues to bring it on practically every album she releases these days. And Growing Pains is no different. She busts out with the highly energetic and super sassy \"Work That\" to lead off the album. Then, like a well-produced mixtape, it seamlessly segues to the equally groove-happy \"Grown Woman\" featuring a decent rap from Ludacris. We are then delighted with the first single \"Just Fine,\" a simple ditty with a happy-go-lucky Mary expressing herself like only she can. \"Feel Like A Woman\" is a slower cut that basically tells men to treat her like a lady. \"Stay Down\" is a more serious track about pushing on through the tough times and not giving up so easily. Those same sentiments are reverberated on the songs \"Talk To Me\" and \"If You Love Me.\" \"Hurt Again\" is a smooth track that discusses the inner battle between being in love and not setting yourself up for a broken heart...yet again. Usher has the album's only other cameo appearance for the straightforward \"Shake Down.\" \"Till The Morning\" has an old school bounce to it, with lyrics from Mary to match. \"Roses\" is one of Mary's most powerful songs of recent memory, essentially saying that it takes more than just the little things to make a relationship work. \"Fade Away\" speaks about losing a love and having trouble facing the world again and moving on with all the heartache consuming your spirit. \"What Love Is\" is a very deep and analytical song about the different emotions and moods that truthfully depends on your current status with love. \"Work In Progress (Growing Pains)\" is a self-explanatory track about Mary still being just as imperfect as the next person. Mary gets a little abstract with the simple yet cryptic track \"Smoke,\" leaving room for the listener to draw their own conclusions on what she's really talking about. The subdued power ballad \"Come To Me (Peace)\" closes out the album on a positive note. Growing Pains is definitely closer to her classic material even though it doesn't quite reach those heights on it's own. Nevertheless, MJB brings us another solid effort to enjoy until the next album comes out. And with a formula that is obviously working, Mary J. Blige will certainly bring it once again.","classification":4,"fold":6}

That album is also fantastic.\nThis record much like TLIL is using a singer that sounds nothing like RJD which is the absolute right way to go.

The drummer being Vinny Appice( he also plays on TLIL record) is simply one of the greatest drummers in hard rock\/ heavy metal.\nThe vocals are done well by Chas West.\nI really wish the radio would play this stuff like in the good ole days when rock radio was cool.\nWe are all treated to very cool HR and HM these days, you just have to look for it. Don't depend on radio.\nThis album is as good as anything great back in the day.\nI usually don't point one one particular song in my reviews. But the track Path Of Love ( 7) is just outstanding. I listened to it on the way home from work and kept rewinding( showing my age, old cassette tape term for any young ones that may be reading this) and I don't do that very often.

She was born to sing the blues mixed with gospel and even a little pure rock 'n roll.\nIn 1972, another triumph occurred when they took Aretha down to the New Temple Baptist Church in Los Angeles and let her acquaint her audience with her roots in the church.\nYou would have had to be a true heathen not to be moved, touched and inspired by this amazing album.\nI knew some of the spirituals like \"Amazing Grace\", \"Mary Don't You Weep\" and \"Climbing Every Mountain\".

What you may not know is that they have a new singer, and the guy is a master of his craft. You can actually hear it easily as he isn't afraid to change pitch or keys because when he does, there is no break in his voice. It is seamless, and suggests that he either has actual vocal training or has spent a lot of time perfecting his craft. Plus, he actually has a great voice to begin with.\nAnyway, the songs on this album are pretty awesome, and they are often hilarious as well. They are catchy, and you will find yourself humming them  in settings where, if you were really thinking about what the lyrics are actually saying, you might hesitate, lol.\n\nReally, this is eminently listenable, and hilarious from the aspect that you could easily not even realize what the songs are actually about.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"(3 & 1\/2 stars)\n\nMs. O'Donovan has one of those sweet-yet-substantial voices like Alison Krauss', the kind of singing I could just listen to forever. I loved her album Fossils ('13), and I am still happy to follow her music on those songs, even through some of its twists and turns. In the past, she toured with Punch Brothers and recorded with acclaimed jazz musicians such as Dave Douglas, so I shouldn't have been surprised at how \"out there\" some of her new songs on *In the Magic Hour* are. For every tune that has a more traditional structure (\"Detour Sign,\" \"Porch Light\") there are others of a more exploratory nature, culminating in the album's closing number, \"Jupiter.\" On that track, Aoife lays down a vocal that seems to have very little to do with the nebulous backing arrangement. It's as if she said to the other players, \"I'm gonna sing something, and you guys just play whatever comes to you.\" Improvisatory songs like that are less appealing to me. I will always like her singing, but the loosely structured material on *Magic Hour* just drifts away from me, leaving little behind.","classification":3,"fold":6}

Demi Lovato has had a lot of ups and downs in her personal life, but honestly she has not really had good music choices in her heart. After Skyscraper, she has been trying to mostly be more like Beyonce' Knowles in her music and not being strong at her own voice. I found her last song Cool For The Summer to lag at the soul, and just feeling less than enticing than Heart Attack was. Her latest single, the song self-titled song from her third album Confident, tries to ignite from the heart, and sadly it doesn't work for her at all. I feel the song was even louder than her voice was shown at all. I think that Demi needs to show more sides of her, than just trying to stay the same way, because it has lagged in her work. Maybe she'll do better if she puts more diversity at her soul.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":6}

Coming 6 years after their last album, this is their longest gap between albums, as the band members dealt with lineup changes and worked on various side projects. These side projects included frontman Ed Roland's impressive southern rock outfit \"Sweet Tea Project.\"\n\nRoland and company have returned with the same formula; crunching guitar riffs, smooth melodies, and introspective lyrics...but the singles are a bit better this time around. \"This\" is reminiscent of 1995-era Collective Soul, while \"AYTA\" is an inspiring, positive song that could really only come from this band. Slightly better than their most recent albums (and only slightly below their best 90's stuff), this album finds CS in their comfort zone, doing what they do best and doing it quite well.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Included with the disc is a 4-page foldout containing song titles\/credits, song lyrics, band photos, and than you's. Recorded at Superstar Studios, West Columbia, SC. Label - Columbia.\n\nCOMMENTS: Judging by the lack of reviews here on Amazon, Crossfade's popularity is waning. Outside of the occasional \"Cold\" from their 2004 debut, and a quick run of \"Invincible\" from this album when it was first released in August '06... I'm not hearing Crossfade on the radio. The problem here is... the songs are down-right average. The players are competent, but the melodies just aren't memorable. The other issue is there are too many bands putting out the same style of music... but, with better tunes (out of the group listed above, Breaking Benjamin is probably the best). With that being said, there are some decent songs here - the opener \"Washing The World Away\", the semi-hit \"Invincible\", the moderate rocker \"Breathing Slowly\", and the piano ballad closer \"Never Coming Home\". Crossfade's debut was better, but not by much (at least it had one full fledged hit). \"Falling Away\" is a tamer group of songs - an average album that meets and occasionally exceeds expectations (2.5 stars).","classification":3,"fold":6}

But instead of letting this stop them, they went for the sweeter, the deeper cut, and they got it. Yes, this is mainstream country pop, but it is sung with conviction, and the banjos, and harmonica driven tunes are comforting in a way that never becomes too cloying.  This is a superbly crafted, brightly produced album that doesn't seem too overproduced, that stands up to further listens, and gives me great hope that these folks are in it for the long haul.  give them a chance, and they'll take your hear along with your ears.

It showcases another tremendous step forward for the band as their famous lineup in clinched with the addition of Al DiMeola on guitar and Chick Corea's first use of the synthesizer,in this case a moog. A little under half these tracks over consist of 1-2 minute varriations on the title track and tracks like White's \"The Shadow Of Lo\" and Chicks own \"Song To The Pharoah Kings\" do run on a bit longer but in terms of virtuoso musicianship know no equal of course,even if they don't make very easy casual listening.

On \"Earth Juice\" Clarke focuses more on his bass playing and they even return to musical ideas as expressed on the previous album on \"Return To The Seventh Galaxy\".

We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic. Whether we are asleep with this beautiful song 'secreting' itself into our memory or 'relaxing' in our romantic, nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning, enrichment, and themes so present in this joyous, uplifting recording. \"Just send for me, oh baby.\"\n\n\"Remember the day I set you free\nI told you you could always count on me\nFrom that day on, I made a vow,\nI'll be there when you want me,\nSome way, some how.\n\n'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,\nAin't no valley low enough,\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you babe.\n\nMy love is alive\nWay down in my heart\nAlthough we are miles apart\nIf you ever need a helping hand,\nI'll be there on the double\nAs fast as I can.\nDon't you know that there\n\nAin't no mountain high enough,\nAin't no valley low enough,\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you babe.\"","classification":5,"fold":6}

Opening track proper \"Going Leaving\" (after the \"Greater Than One Less Than three\" intro with lovely layered harmonies) perfectly epitomizes this, a groovy mid-tempo affair with cascading sweet harmonies. \"Takes22Tango\" is slinky Soul with a touch of Tango, while Raheem DeVaughn guests on the groovy ballad \"What You Gotta Do\" with snaky-sounding bass. The up-tempo groove \"What Profit\" reminds me of Musiq Soulchild.\n\nMost of the song segue into the next. The ballad \"Obey\" builds from synth strings, adding lilting percussion and jazzy piano along the way, different and definitely a highlight. \"This Love\" is a synth-driven upbeat groovy number, and continuing the party groove is the gently stomping minimal \"Must Be\" featuring Black Milk, L'Renee and J. Tait.\n\nThe jazzy ballad \"Swank\" features a lengthy musical intro, a nice horn section, and Monica Blair who also appears on the upbeat \"Patrick Ronald\" where Dwele blames his drink as he tells says \"That girl, she lookin' good\/ she came up on me talmbout `whassup' I said `my wood,\/ sorry, that's Patrick talkin.'\". Closing is the spare piano with light guitar and percussion touches intermittedly. ballad \"Frankly My Dear (I'm Bennett I Ain't Innit)\" which finds him flitting from falsetto to lower register.

The differences between those later collaborations (after the Count, like the one with Coltrane) is that the producers took away The Duke from his Big Band. The Coltrane album is just the two of them. That's great, but Duke made his claim to fame with his big band, and this album with Count allows two of the greatest big band leaders of all time to go at it. The results are just splendid.

{"text":"One of my children gave me \"Babel\" to find out what I thought of this latest phenom -- and it's not bad.  Their biggest asset so far, I think, is Marcus Mumford's attractively raspy voice, which maintains its character whether he's singing loudly or softly, and he delivers his words with total commitment.  The lyrics themselves are a bit too self-consciously poetic, but they fail to resonate in the way that Dylan's or Simon's or Cohen's did in their culture.  All that said, though, they aren't just a tissue of cliches.  The band's sound is attractively airy, but they depend too much on loud strumming banjo effects.  It's not clear that any of them are really skillful instrumentalists -- that might be being unfair, but if it is, somebody has to write the music to showcase that skill.  There's a definite striving to give the songs an \"anthemic\" feel, and that might be militating against interesting playing.  I think all the songs work pretty well -- \"Babel\" and \"Lover of the Light\" linger in my memory more than the others.  I look forward to seeing how they develop.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Recording an album in a vast abandoned pasta sauce factory near Rhode Island clearly impacted on The Low Anthem for their third release \"Smart Flesh\". On times you can almost feel the shivering inducing atmospherics seep into this record. As such it is an album that has more in common with their 2007 country orientated \"What the crow brings\" than 2009's breakthrough \"Oh my god Charlie Darwin\" with Ben Knox Miller and co returning with a sparse and eerily slow piece of work which brims with nostalgia and fragile delicacy. \"Smart Flesh\" is an album you have going to have to stick with until its starts to burrow into your head like an old prairie dog into the great plains. It has a flyover states feel to it and the spirits of Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris, Leonard Cohen, The Band and Mercury Rev scream out of its vinyl grooves and often luminous compositions.\n\nThe Low Anthem are a band that reaffirms your faith in real music. 2009s \"Oh my god Charlie Darwin\" was one of the best of albums of that year and in ballads like \"To Ohio\", \"To the Ghosts who write history books\" and \"Charlie Darwin\" they produced some of the finest songs of the past decade. Yet judged together \"OMGCD\" was a bit of a bi-polar record with lovely choral folk sitting alongside Pogues style out and out stompers. \"Smart Flesh\" is alternatively more of a unified and complete whole but it does have real weakness and you may struggle to get to excited by either \"Love and alter\" which just about stays the right side of an Art Garfunkel song, the glacially ponderous title track which could have been happily edited from its seven plus minutes to half its length or the pleasant but rather anodyne instrumental \"Wire\". There is little doubt that some Amazon buyers will complain with real justice that the prevailing solemnness appears to make the record devoid of real colour and somewhat atonal particularly on the first few listens and for a while I had this marked at three stars.\n\nYet there is real depth here and in \"Apothecary love\" the band have recorded a stone cold country classic in the mould of Gram Parsons destined to be covered by long established Nashville artists who desire a career kick start, while the lovely \"Matter of time\" is a heartbreakingly beautiful lament. It is the Leonard Cohen inspired \"Burn\" however that stands out with a oh so tender vocal by Knox Miller making it one of the best songs of the year thus far and full marks for the employment of the best use of a bow saw since Mercury Rev's \"Deserters Songs\". Only two songs break the prevailing mood and they are the thumping and raucous \"Boeing 747\" presumably about the 9\/11 outrages could have happily appeared on Arcade Fire's \"The suburbs\". The swirling organ based \"Hey all you hippies\" conversely sounds like the Low Anthem have been down in the same basement in Woodstock that gave Dylan and the Band so much inspiration all those years ago.\n\nUltimately this is not quite the outright classic that Miller and co would want the album to be and after numerous listens it's difficult to plot a routemap where this band go next but it will be very interesting to watch. In one sense \"Smart Flesh\" is the dark side and counterpoint to the Decemberists recent album of bright Americana \"The King is dead\". That said this an album where the highlights such as the brilliant \"Ghost Woman blues\" or the frontier banjo folk of \"I'll take out your ashes' make you forgive the weaknesses. \"Smart flesh\" will require a real investment of time and commitment for the listener but there are sure signs here that it will reward aplenty as you grow to appreciate its nuances and subtleties. It is a slow burner from a band which is nonetheless rapidly maturing towards peak fitness.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nWhile a great deal of my music library is comprised of Amazon's free songs, I splurged and spent a whopping 69 cents on this one.  Thats right...Amazon has a FREEBIE \/ CHEAP section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies or really good digital music deals (69 cent songs, $5 albums!), you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Departments (drop down menu) --> Digital and Prime Music -->Deals --> Songs by Price \/ Albums by Price (on left side of screen)","classification":5,"fold":6}

He released albums sporadically over the next decade, including the inspirational titles Changed  in 2004 and Sing About Jesus in 2007. Varese's new collection pulls together a dozen originals from that pair of self-released albums, offering testimony of rebirth and giving witness to the warmth of faith's family. Bruce sings of Christian charity, makes the most of his resonant voice on the bluesy \"Tougher Than Nails,\" and works through feelings of loss on \"I Know.\" There's folk, country, blues, two-steppers and gospel swing that will please everyone, and plenty of praise to please the faithful. 3-1\/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

{"text":"Originally this track was a bonus song on the Target deluxe version of the \"1989\" album.  Taylor and her record company made a very good decision in releasing this track as a single.  It is beautiful drum-infused exploration of a special time in a relationship - when lovers get lost in their own world, \"down a rabbit hole,\" and the most important events unfolding in the universe are what happens between two lovers.  However, there are no guarantees in life and many relationships run their course, burning hot then turning cold and ending.  Taylor experiences the end of her relationship with strength as she recognizes the unique opportunities and emotions she felt with her partner.  To feel the joy, the blessings, the exuberance of the wonderland she shared with her partner is unlike anything else in the world.  Taylor delivers an assured vocal on \"Wonderland\" which she co-wrote, as her performance is authentic.  There is an echo of Gwen Stefani or Lady Gaga in the \"Eh eh eh\" refrain, but rather than a negative, these lines fit perfectly with Taylor's narrative.  I recommend adding \"Wonderland\" to your music library.\n\nRob.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"I have been into  Pink Floyd for many years. I own  Meddle, Dark Side of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall, The Division Bell and many others. When I heard that Pink Floyd was releasing a new album, I was in a state of disblief. I always thought that The Division Bell would be the last one, as David Gilmour had no intention to do anything with PF. But, just when I thought that everything was over for PF, they surprised us with this new album. The Endless River is an album that focuses on the recordings left by Richard Wright during The Division Bell sessions, 21 years ago. Those forgotten  songs were rescued by Gilmour and Mason, who re-worked it on the studio, along with Polly Samson, David's wife, and several session musicians, including bassist Guy Pratt, who collaborated with PF on The Division Bell and their last Live album P.U.L.S.E.  With the sole exception of \"Louder Than Words\", most of the tracks are atmospheric, instrumental ones. The Endless River shows Richard Wright's magnificent keyboard works, along with Gilmour's masterful guitar performance and Nick Mason's superb drumming. Worth to mention is that Roger Waters is not on the album. Pity! Anyway, this is an incredible piece of  work that, although it cannot be compared to their previous masterpieces (Dark Side Of The Moon and The Wall included), it is pretty close to them. It is beautifully and perfectly done, just like as Richard Wright would have loved to do it. Sadly, Rick Wright passed away in 2008, and did not see this PF project. So, aside of being a tribute to Richard Wright`s work with PF, The Endless River is his swansong and, probably, PF`s last album. I highly recommend it to all PF fans.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Clare will often use vocals and instrumentation with great effect, though lyrically some songs do fall flat.\nIf you're a fan of 'Too Close', the rest of the album will not disappoint!

And I'm unfamiliar with The Script as a band, or with the work of will.i.am beyond the \"Samurai Jack\" theme song (yes, I'm a cartoon buff...).  But a family member introduced me to this song, a collaboration by both bands... and I found it to be an amazing song.  Not just for having a catchy beat and lyrics that are actually intelligible and (fairly) clean, but for having an incredibly inspiring message as well.  It's not just a good song, but a powerful anthem toward being the best you can be and following your dreams.  And while that may seem like a saccharine message in our day and age, it's still a meaningful one, and one we need to remember.\n\nThis song makes me want to check out more of The Script's work... and perhaps give more of the work of will.i.am a shot.

Plant does it well and always brings something new to the table new & fresh. If you are a Plant fan & open-minded, this album is for you.

{"text":"Cool!  An entire album of prevously unreleased live Johnny Cash goodies from his commercial heyday in 1969, repeating the success of his earlier concert albums, but here performing for the city slickers in the Big Apple.  Johnny is joined by the reconstituted Carter Family, brother Tommy Cash, the Statler Brothers (who he was a patron of...)  and fellow Sun Records veteran Carl Perkins (as we hear on a  track intro at the very end of the album, June Carter Cash wasn't able to attend as she was six months pregnant at the time...)  It's an efficient, professional  presentation, yet one that gives some nice glimpses into Cash's inner life, mostly through the spoken introductions that accompany many of the songs.  The most telling is the intro to \"Last Night I Had The Strangest Dream,\" in which Cash addresses the thorny issue of the Vietnam War.  Stumbling nervously, hoping not to offend anyone one way or the other, Cash recalls how he and his show went to entertain the troops overseas, declaring, \"I may not be a hawk... But maybe I'm a dove with claws...\"  He also introduces a few songs with asides about his down-home background; back then, these monologes may have been a bit hokey, but they've added resonance as Cash has gotten older and his legend increased.  Also of interest is an angry, emotional reading of his Native American rights protest song, \"As Long As Grass Shall Grow,\" which is one of the most powerful performances of Cash's career.  There are also plenty of religious tunes, which he also puts his heart into.  There are some rushed moments, but on the whole, this is an album well worth checking out, and certainly a delight for longtime Cash fans who have never heard this material before.","classification":5,"fold":6}

At times I have really no idea what she is singing about at all but it sure sounds beautiful. The production value on this album is outstanding and the sound is crisp. The book-let is a mixed bag and the photo on the cover is terrible and looks like it has been taken by some high-school kid or shot with a cheap instant camera. The font is easy on the eye and the lyrics are therefore easy to read. This is a very good album that could use text editing but apart from this I give it four out five stars.","classification":4,"fold":6}

Then it seemed like it took a long time for this cd to come out.  And when it finally did.  It is my choice for album of the year.  At least in my cd collection.  Amen turned out to be the only thing close to a hit that they had.  Hannah soon got married and the band dissolved.  Our loss.  There is not a bad song on here.  Swingin' Door, Last Supper the Gosphel Acapella Christ Alone are all super.  But as good as this cd is.  The song Cherry Pie makes it even better.  About all the people in your life who  have influenced you and made you the person you are.  And Cherry Pie is a horse so it is not only about people.  It get's me to thinking about my own life.

{"text":"\"Little Victories\" is a strong outing by Chris Knight.  His hard-hitting, hard-luck tales of woe & redemption continue to fascinate me.  The rocking opener \"In the Mean Time\" blows the roof off with a hard rocking track studded with churning electric guitars and Chris' vocals in perpetual snarl, \"Sometimes I wonder where the next dollar's going to come from; I keep my head up till something falls out of the sky; Daddy taught me how to use my boot straps & carry on; He said, 'God'll be good to you son if you try.'\"  \"Nothing On Me\" is another addictively great tune with the guitars droning on like a guy who labors day-to-day trying to make his rent, \"Times are tough but they ain't got nothing on me.\"  \"Hard Edges\" is another of my favorites with the banjo picking out the simple melody with Chris' vocals like a whispered conscience, \"Lisa's in a club downtown where the neon burns till dawn, She calls herself Tina now, but she dances to the same old song.\"  This is a strong set, another little victory.  Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":6}
{"text":"Do I really have to review this? For many, this is the only Yes song they've ever heard - well, this and \"Owner Of A Lonely Heart\" - but it's arguably the best distillation of everything good about Yes. As was the case with the Doors' \"Light My Fire,\" many of us first heard the edited 45 rpm version back in '72, only to find there was a version twice as long on the album. Come to think of it, \"Roundabout\" dashes through the door \"Light My Fire\" had opened five years previously. Both employ a prominent Classical-sounding organ riff along with Spanish guitar scales. However, next to \"Roundablut,\" \"Light My Fire\" sounds positively earthbound (not that that's a bad thing). Maybe the Doors and Yes should have swapped lead singers, just as an experiment. I can imagine Jon Anderson singing \"The End,\" but I can't imagine Jim Morrison singing \"Roundabout.\" There, have I typed enough words for this to qualify as a review?","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"Slow Train Coming-Bob Dylan ****\n\nWho saw it coming certainly not me. Bob Dylan a born and raised Jewish man who his entire career had songs dealing with his faith suddenly converted to Christianity. In 1978 Bob Dylan officialy converted to the Christian faith and has been devout ever since. In the process of embracing Jesus Christ as his lord and saviour he managed to write an entire album about it and a hit one at that. Slow Train coming would be the last hit Bob Dylan album for almost thirty years and it would also give him his last hit single of his career. Who knew that singing about the most contraversial subject ever could be turned into a massive success, only Dylan could make it happen.\n\nAfter Slow Train Coming Dylan would go into a finger pointing faze preeching instead of spreading the word of his lord, but doing so with the threat of hellfire and brimstone and consequently losing a lot of his fan base in the process not that he cared. Slow Train Coming was a rare album and a rare moment in the history of Bob Dylan because we never saw him this happy, voulnerable, or inspired again in his career\n\nWith the exception of 'When You Gonna Wake Up' the album is mostly happy and up beat in praise and very possitive. The song 'When You Gonna Wake Up' was a sign of things to come in a negative way, becaus earound the corner was nothing but judgement from Dylan. Really it was nothing but albums of judgement. But being as this record was recorded with legendary hardcore Jewish producer Jerry Wexler (Ray Charles, Motown), I don't think the man would have stood for finger pointing. 'Gotta Serve Somebody' became Dylans last hit single of the 1970's as well as his last hit single of his career. It's got a very loose feel and is full of Jamacan influence and lots of heavy organ, it is easy to see why this became such a big hit. Throughout the album someone other then Bob Dylans musical abilities shine, and that is of Mark Knopfler of Dire Straights, yes the legandary axe slinger plays through out the album and is an asset to the team on tracks like 'Precious Angel' and 'Slow Train.' The former is amazing and would have fit well on Dire Straights debut. The later 'Slow Train' is quite simply one of the best songs that Bob Dylan has ever recorded in his life period.\n\nDylans lyrics have always been known for beig nothing short of brilliant, but on this album they seem and feel more inspired then usuall. That may be do to his new found faith. The imagery dipicted in his words are amazing and you feel like your there whitnessing Dylan speak to his lord right in front of you. 'Man Gave Names To All The Animals' does seem like nothing more then a childhood neursery rhyme but it does at nice texture to the album and lighten the mood a little as it is a nod to Noah and his ark.\n\nSlow Train Coming is a must have for all fans of Dlyans work. It is his last essentail album for almost thirty years. After this Dylans albums were all hit or miss and even the decent ones are not essential and sound very dated. It wasn't until the late 1990's that Dylan did anything worth while. Since then he has released three albums that are among his best, Time Out Of Mind, Love And Theft, and Modern Times. Make Slow Train Coming apart of your Dylan collection.","classification":4,"fold":6}

This album focuses on a live sound and it shows on many songs.  Everything I Do (with its similar Bryan Adams song title in the chorus) is the best song here, as Brian shows that falsetto a lot on this song! A couple of the songs, he sounds eerily close to Marvin Gaye.  Because Brian is so true to his music, writing and producing his own songs, this album is one of his best.  I like his hip-hop driven songs with Talib Kweli, Juvenile and others, and he has his own heavy beats on those songs! Brian does his own Dr. Dre thing on these few songs! The final number is dramatic and very timely for the Lent season of some religions. Brian's song about Jesus on this final song is moving and emotional.

The first CD alone is a primer for rock and roll history, with \"Satisfaction,\" \"Jumping Jack Flash\" and \"Sympathy for The Devil\" alone being the kind of songs bands would chew their hind legs off to compose...or even come up with a guitar lick as memorable. You'll also get a trio of the early, greasy Stones with \"Come On,\" a cover of Buddy Holly's \"Not Fade Away\" and Mick and Keith laying down some early blues with \"Little Red Rooster.\" It's the kind of early material most compilations tend to skip over.\n\nDisc two contains plenty of latter classics, like \"Miss You,\" \"Brown Sugar\" and \"Start Me Up.\" But it also reminds you why the band once titled one of their single disc sets \"Sucking In The Seventies.\"  It makes you stuck with weaker material like \"Angie\" or \"Emotional Rescue,\" along with the 80's material that was the band turning into a polished hit machine. Some of these songs hold up surprisingly well, like \"Undercover of The Night,\" but \"Anybody Seen My Baby\" could have been left off and I don't think I'd have noticed.\n\nOf the new songs, \"Doom and Gloom\" has serious swagger while \"One More Shot\" runs on fumes, really. But that still makes a whole batch of Jagger\/Richards composition (along with a couple covers, like the aforementioned Buddy Holly song and \"Harlem Shuffle.\" And no-one keeps a beat like Charlie Watts. Like all Stones collections, you can't always get what you want (She's So Cold\"), but sometimes you get what you need. Or depending on which set, what you pay for.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"RCA's \"Fabulous Swing Collection\" was released to exploit a national big band revival craze, led by groups like Cherry Poppin' Daddies and Brian Setzer's Orchestra and in full swing (pardon the pun) in 1998. That revival has cooled but this generous (19 songs, 65 minutes) set remains among the era's better one-disc compilations (all songs from RCA family labels)  for now third-generation fans.\nIt may not have been all the classics revivalists danced to; two swingin' Louises (Prima and Jordan) recorded their jump, jive and wailin' big band tunes for Capitol and Decca Records, respectively. But many of the era's signature tunes are represented, sounding surprisingly warm in analog sound: Glenn Miller's anthemic \"In The Mood,\" \"String of Pearls,\" and \"American Patrol,\" Benny Goodman's hard, wild swinging \"Sing, Sing, Sing\" (heard recently and famously in a cookie commercial but better in Goodman's 1938 Carnegie Hall concert), Cab Calloway's 1933 \"Minnie The Moocher,\" which he performed nearly a half-century later in the first \"Blues Brothers\" film and here does in full-throated youthful yodel.\nYou also get seminal sides from Charlie Barnet (\"Cherokee\"), Tommy Dorsey (\"Marie,\" \"Opus One\"), and Duke Ellington (\"Take The 'A' Train,\" \"Cotton Tail\"). While these songs swing sweeter than 1998's martini-and-cigar crowd might have liked, \"Fabulous\" may well be among the few big band CDs a new fan would need. Longtime fans have these classics on the artists' original LPs (or more studious sets like Columbia's \"16 Most Requested Big Band Themes\") and can probably swing past it.","classification":4,"fold":6}

Other hot songs are \"Fallin\", \"730\" amongst hot joints with Baby Cham and Ron Isley. The album is hot. \"I don't care\" is another classic is which she says \" to all the haters that be looking to fade us, we not concerned with what you put in the papers\". Lil Kim said in her album, that people had the gall to be re-writting her rhymes and Foxy says that people can do the thing she does. The lines are probably sent for one rapper to the other. Foxy also said in her song Fallin \"I shed tears when Biggie and Pac got killed, there's only one other broad who really got skill, she's alright, but she's not real\". Is this for Lil Kim, maybe.

{"text":"Last year, Band of Horses released a truly impressive debut album \"Everything All the time\", containing several instantly classic songs like \"The Funeral\" and \"The Great Salt Lake\". Despite pretty much non-stop touring since them the guys are back already with a new album.\n\n\"Cease to Begin\" (10 tracks, 35 min.) is an equally impressive album. The opener \"Is There A Ghost\" starts off very BoH-like, only to crash into electric guitars and very up-tempo about 1 minute into the song, bringing the message that these guys have expanded their musical pallet. \"Ode to Lag\" follows, with equally strong music. The good tracks keep coing: \"No One's Gonna Love You\" is a great pensive tune, as is \"Detlef Schrempf\" (yes, he the German former NBA basketball player), and \"The General Specific\" closes the first half of the album, an exuberrant tune. After a short instrumental, the second half kicks off with a rousing \"Islands On the Coast\", followed by a great, somber \"Marry Song\", with superb underlying keyboards. Yet the best is still to come! \"Cigarettes Wedding Bands\" is THE stand-out track of the album, sure proof how much BoH has matured musically in just a year's time. The closer \"Window Blues\" is too twangy\/country for my liking, and the least interesting track on the album.\n\n\"Cease to Begin\" is an outstanding album, and equal, if not better, than \"Everything All the Time\". They have not so much abandoned their early-My Morning Jacket-soundalike style, but expanded on it, to great effect. I've had the good fortune of seeing Band of Horses last year during the \"Everything All the Time\" tour, and if you have a chance to see these guys in concert, don't miss them, you will be blown away. Meanwhile \"Cease to Begin\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Rene Leibowitz's fabled Beethoven Symphony cycle with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra makes a welcome reappearance as a costs-next-to-nothing MP3 download. Recorded in - I believe - 1961 for LP release on Reader's Digest, in recent decades the cycle has also appeared on CDs from Reader's Digest, Menuet, Scribendum and Chesky.\n\nThis cycle is renown for the energetic playing of the orchestra, in large part because Leibowitz opts for fairly fast tempi in the Allegros and an overall objective approach when it comes to matters of rubato. The orchestral playing is very good, even if one can occasionally quibble with the sound coming from various choirs at various times (I'm not that enamored of the solo oboist, for example). There are also occasions of loose ensemble playing, some of it quite obvious. It's what you'd expect from a cycle that didn't have the benefit of multiple retakes. Whether these problems irritate over the long haul is an individual thing.\n\nIt isn't at all a stretch to say that Leibowitz anticipates the HIP movement to a certain extent in these recordings, though the ghost of Toscanini hovers writ large over the proceedings, even though Leibowitz was a very vocal critic of Toscanini's approach to Beethoven.\n\nWhile Leibowitz is forward looking in his choice of tempi, he embraces the 1960s zeitgeist when it comes to matters of first-movement repeats - which is to say he's a bit cavalier in their observation, playing the first movement repeats only in symphonies 1, 5, 6 & 8, while ignoring the repeat in the Finale of the 5th. No big deal - such selective practice was the norm in performances and recordings at the time this set was committed to disc. Speaking of tempos, I can't say I'm a fan of Leibowitz's race through the instrumental *recitativo* in the Finale of the 9th. More \"recitativo\" and less \"but in tempo\" works better for me.\n\nI've been acquainted with these recordings since I purchased them on Reader's Digest stereo LPs back in 1970. They don't wear out their welcome, even if they ultimately sit just outside of any top ten list one might put together. Their main fault is that Leibowitz's objectivity tends to narrow the set's virtues - while its virtues are front-and-center and always enjoyable, repeat hearings don't necessarily reveal new layers of interest, as do, say, Toscanini's recordings. The Ninth is particularly enjoyable (*pace!* my comment above), featuring an excellent solo quartet (Inge Borkh, Ruth Stewart, Richard Lewis and Ludwig Weber) and chorus (Beecham Choral Society) who are well-balanced into the soundstage of the recording.\n\nThe sound of the MP3 is very, very good, with a nice hall ambience that mirrors what I've heard on hard media over the decades. There are, however, a few glitches here and there that would probably cause one to exchange a CD for a new copy, had one paid CD prices for the recordings. At $1.09 for the entire cycle PLUS a whole lot more, it's easier to dismiss the glitches as incidental and unimportant distractions to one's basic listening pleasure: if you're listening to these while exercising, said glitches are no more distracting than that dog barking off in the distance.\n\nI highly recommend this download: 4 stars, holding back one star for the aforementioned glitches.\n\nBTW - if you find that you like this cycle so much that you want to own it on CD, I recommend going for the inexpensive \"Menuet\" versions. They seem to stay in the catalog, while others go oop and start costing an arm and a leg. I owned both the Menuet set AND the Chesky set at one time. When it came time to opt for one, I ended up keeping the Menuet version. I simply found it better overall than the Chesky. So, save your money and your valuable time: go for the Menuet versions. Better yet, bide your time - someone else is sure to reissue this set on CD at a budget price sometime in the near future.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Read my other reviews and you'll notice a pattern. I'll let everyone else debate the merits of the album. This review is for those eager to buy the album but are still deciding about know which version to get.\n\nDOWNLOAD Versus CD? - Depends on sale price\nIf the download is still sale priced at or below five clams when you see this AND you're just a casual fan - I'd go download. It's an incredible deal. Sonically, there's not much a difference in sound the way this album is mixed.\n\nCD Versus Deluxe CD?\nThe one thing the regular edition of the CD has going for it is the traditional jewel case. An easier to access CD and a booklet that won't get worn down too easily. The Deluxe edition is in an annoying DigiPak - the type where you need to seriously wrestle with it to remove the disc without snapping it in half. Once I liberated mine, I re-housed it in a regular slimline case. The colorful booklet is stitched into the digipak case, which looks lovely, but needs to be handled with white gloves to preserve it's condition. In an odd move, the side pocket that could have housed the CD (preferred) or booklet is instead stuffed with a 2-sided mini poster. Clearly, they are going after the tween girl demographic with this move, but if my phantom baby daughter tucked a poster of a 30-year old man in her locker, I would buy her some Bieber stat.\n\nThe main reason to go Deluxe is the 4 bonus tracks. You get \"The Clock Was Ticking\" - a Grand Ole Opry country romp that also recalls the lyrical pace of The Nails' \"88 Lines for 44 Women\" and Jim Carrol's \"People Who Died.\" \"Jacksonville\" is an album highlight - a trippy number with a slinky beat and a chilling woven bass guitar line. \"I Came Here To Get Over You\" almost sounds like a great lost Weezer song and \"Right Behind You\" brings the album to a proper close with heavy wet synths.\n\nOverall - this album, even more than the b-sides comp \"Sawdust\" feels like a full-fledged Killers album. I recently bought solo outings from Paul Banks (Interpol) and Julian Casablancas (The Strokes) - both tread new territory, but were so sterile they left me little inspiration for repeat listens. Flamingo is much more warm and inviting, like Las Vegas luring headlights down Highway 15 in the dead of night.","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"This song pretty much rules rock radio right now. Which is kind of sad, because if this is the best they have, they're in trouble. The song itself doesn't break any ground, and while its melody and overall musical structure may be fine, albeit a little radio-friendly, I think what really draws people into the song is the vocals. They're kind of different, and they grab your attention. They're not stunning in the least bit, but it's different. And some might consider the song a nice change. However, wiser heads would look at the song and say, yeah, it's alright.\n\nOverall, the song doesn't break much ground, and seems in the mold of a thousand before. However, the vocals grab you, and pull you into the song. In the end, Buckcherry may be a one-hit wonder. But then again, the song could just be a stepping stone for us to see what the group is really made of.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"I had no idea who Todd Snider was when I bought this album, but I quickly had to find out. There is no doubt that HWA is comprised of some world-class musicians, but Snider's raspy growl is the show stealer on this album. For a group of covers, the songs on this eponymous record flow together rather nicely, and, in fact, before I realized they were covers, I thought that Snider must be one heck of a lyricist as well a great singer. The music is foot-stompin' and swampy and extremely well played rock 'n' blues with some folk thrown in for good measure, but the reason I will go back to this album time and again is because of the unique and almost hypnotizing way Snider's vocal delivery works with each tune. Highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Winwood produced it, co-wrote all the songs, and plays all of the instruments himself. And, of course, he sings with that marvelous Ray Charles-ish voice. The album is a keyboard-heavy platter of pop, and it's all good. The catchy \"While You See A Chance\" was a big #2 hit for Steve on the U.S. singles chart, but there are also other goodies including the atmospheric title song, the breezy \"Second Hand Woman,\" the great grooves of \"Spanish Dancer,\" and the up-tempo funk-pop of \"Night Train\" (featuring some fine electric guitar from Winwood). Steve also slows things down a bit for the cool mellowness of \"Slowdown Sundown\" and \"Dust.\" \"Arc Of A Diver\" is a great Steve Winwood album.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Having finished with Blood, Sweat & Tears and their debut album \"Child Is Father To The Man\" in 1968  AL KOOPER found himself the in-house Producer at Columbia Records in need of a project. So he calls up ex Electric Flag and Paul Butterfield Blues band ace guitarist MIKE BLOOMFIELD and together they determine to make a 'quickie'  a Blues and Soul jam album they'll pump out in one manic session. They get down enough material for one whole side of an LP (a couple of covers and some originals) - but Kooper needs the remainder. With Bloomfield flown the coup (chasing things other than the blues)  Kooper called in ex Buffalo Springfield guitar\/songwriting whizz Stephen Stills to record the rest. And out of these most unlikely of 'sessions'  history was born. Columbia CS 9701 (Stereo) peaked on the LP chart at an impressive 12 and started a run of superstar jam sessions - all trying to capture the same lighting in a bottle (common consensus agrees that few got near it).\n\nAl Kooper's liner notes explain that he's gone back with Engineer ALLAN TUCKER to the original master tapes and 24-bit remastered the album to CD. And in keeping with fan-requests over the decades  he's taken off the 'horn' overdubs put on the long jam sessions so devotees of this iconic and cool 60ts album can finally hear Bloomfield workouts like \"Albert's Shuffle\" and \"Season Of The Witch\" 'sans horns' (see bonus tracks 10 and 11). They are magnificent and arguably up there with the best Bonus Tracks ever issued. All in all - you have to say that given what they had to work with  Kooper and Tucker have done a bang-up job. Here is the 'Man's Temptation'...\n\nUS\/UK released April 2003  \"Super Session\" by BLOOMFIELD, KOOPER & STILLS on Columbia\/Legacy COL 508071 2 (Barcode 5099750807125) is an Expanded Edition CD with four Bonus Tracks and plays out as follows (77:14 minutes):\n\n1. Albert's Shuffle\n2. Stop\n3. Man's Temptation\n4. His Holy Modal Majesty\n5. Really\n6. It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry [Side 2]\n7. Season Of The Witch\n8. You Don't Love Me\n9. Harvey's Tune\nTracks 1 to 9 are the album \"Super Session\"  released August 1968 in the USA on Columbia CS 9701 (Stereo) and September 1968 in the UK on CBS Records S 63396.\n\nBONUS TRACKS:\n10. Albert's Shuffle (2002 Remix Without Horns)\n11. Season Of The Witch (2002 Remix without Horns)\n12. Blues For Nothing (Outtake from the Session  first made available on the 1995 Mastersound CD of \"Super Session\" on Columbia CK 64611)\n13. Fat Grey Cloud (Live)  Previously Unreleased (Recorded 1968 at The Fillmore West, San Francisco, CA)\n\nMIKE BLOOMFIELD  Guitar on Tracks 1-5, 10, 12 and 13\nAL KOOPER  Vocals, Ondioline Organ, Piano, Electric and Acoustic Guitars\nSTEPHEN STILLS  Guitar on Tracks 6 -9 and 11\n\nGUESTS:\nBARRY GOLDBERG  Piano on Tracks 1 and 2\nHARVEY BROOKS  Bass\n\"Fast\" EDDIE HOH - Drums\n\nThe 12-page booklet has an opening 'Producers Note' from All Kooper not just explaining the recordings but the CD reissue and his 'without horns' 2002 remixes. BRUCE DICKINSON was Executive Producer for the re-release and both the Michael Thomas original LP liner notes and the David Fricke Rolling Stone Review are reproduced (four-stars from Robert who spends much of his time raving about Bloomfield when Kooper's contribution was just as big if not more in my books). There are some black and white session photos and not much else. ALLAN TUCKER did the Mastering at Foothill Digital Studios in New York and the Audio is fantastic  full of power and presence and that sense of immediacy the recordings had anyway (the Bonus Cuts are beautifully transferred too).\n\nIt opens with a Bloomfield\/Kooper Instrumental called \"Albert's Shuffle\"  nearly nine-minutes of Shuggie Otis type Blues with Bloomfield shouting as he solos  Kooper letting loose on the keys (an organ sound most would kill to get). Next up is the uber-cool \"Stop\"  an instrumental cover of a Howard Tate soul tune on Verve Records from December 1967 (Verve VK 10573). Ive loved this slinky little ditty for decades now and it still has that 60ts chug about it that utterly sends me. Next up is the first vocal by Al Kooper on their version of Curtis Mayfield's \"Man's Temptation\"  a song about a temptress who wants to \"...ruin my happy home with man's temptation... But then we get the magnificent band really cooking on another Bloomfield\/Kooper creation \"His Holy Modal Majesty\"  a 9:19 minute Organ\/Guitar battle that feels like Santana gone Prog by way of the Blues (and I still don't know what the title means). Side 1 ends on the Traditional Slow Blues vibe of \"Really\"  5:26 minutes of Bloomfield letting rip on the frets while Kooper puts in huge chords on the Organ (very tasty mama).\n\nSide 2 has always been problematic for me. It opens with A Stephen Stills take on Dylan's \"It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry\" and to me it immediately sounds like the album has gone off the rails. The tune is OK  but thematically it comes over like poor mans Monkees instead of the fresh Bluesy workouts we were getting on Side 1. Things are brought back from the brink big time by the stunning 11:08 minutes of \"Season Of the Witch\" (a Donovan cover they did on the Side 1 all-day session). Columbia and CBS edited both it and \"Albert's Shuffle\" down to fit on the A&B-sides of a 45 in October 1968 (CBS 3770 in the UK, Columbia 44657 in the USA)  but it did little business despite the success of the album (it's a no-show here due to time constraints). Back to weird with the Hendrix flange cover of a Willie Cobbs tune called \"You Don't Love Me\" which again is good  but still feels wildly out of kilter with the rest of the record. Then we enter mellow Jazz Soul territory with the saxophone-led \"Harvey's Tune\"  another out of step instrumental that sounds like it should be in a Blaxploitation film instead of on this album. But then you're hit with four corkers...\n\nWhile the album has its incongruous moments  the bonus tracks act as an impossibly brilliant counterpoint  the first three sounding like the powerhouse Blues Session that should have been released. Why \"Blues For Nothing\" was left off the album and mediocrity like \"Harvey's Tune\" left on is a total mystery (4:15 minutes) and the two album cuts minus-the-horns actually seem to free the songs and focus you completely on the dynamic duo  Al Kooper on Organ and Mike Bloomfield on Guitar. \"Season Of The Witch\" is the prize here and stretches to its full 11:08 minutes - stripped and raw - it has a renewed power that's thrilling. As if this is not satisfying enough  the live Instrumental Blues of \"Fat Grey Cloud\" is fantastic  Bloomfield joking first about 'tuning' then letting rip  wild one second  Soulful Bluesy the next  with Kooper following after - pumping out an Organ Sound that is huge (4:39 minutes).\n\nIn truth the original album is probably more four-stars than five - but this genius CD reissue with those stunning bonus tracks bumps it up again.\n\n\"...You've got to pick up every stitch...\"  Kooper sings in their funky cover of Donovan's Sixties-sinister \"Season Of The Witch\". And it seems that anything from that incredible 'super session' was indeed worth picking up...","classification":5,"fold":6}

{"text":"There's an old saying: \"If its' not broke, don't fix it.\" Referring in this case to the repeating of a formula that worked so well on her previous CD and applying it again with the same stellar results, perhaps even better. The elements of that alchemy include Kathryn's evocative compositions and grand piano expressions, produced by Grammy-winning Windham Hill founder Will Ackerman at his Imaginary Roads studio in Vermont, with mastering by Corin Nelsen, and a new addition to the team, recording engineer Tom Eaton. And last but not least, the accompaniment of a number of world-class studio musicians, some of whom graced her first album.\n\nSome of Kathryn's compositions, for me, are like musical portraits that evoke the earthy ambience and subtle shadings of an Andrew Wyeth painting. The opening track, a sweet piano solo, entitled \"Mountain Laurel\" is a perfect example. Within its' serenely sylvan melody is revealed a depth for those with ears to hear. The nature theme continues on the second track, \"Meadow Morning,\" which is peaceful and pensive, but with a touch of wistfulness in the air. This is one of the larger ensemble pieces, yet it's understated interplay maintains the delicate demeanor that characterizes the album.\n\nAs pastoral as Kathryn's music can be, she also ventures into other landscapes, such as the decidedly more urban vista of \"An Empty Street In Prague.\" The music so perfectly captures the essence of the title that it is hard not to feel like you are there, your lone footsteps echoing down the cobblestone corridor of the city. The title of \"How Deep, How Simple\" mirrors some of the qualities of Kathryn's music, with its reflective melodies that are unpretentious on the surface while illuminating deep waters below. Speaking of titles, the music on the title track \"Heavy As A Feather\" does a wonderful job of depicting a portrait in sound that has a lightness of being yet is counterbalanced by a subtle sense of gravity. Although there has been no mention (yet) with regard to the next CD, it is unlikely that Kathryn's fans will cease calling for an encore until she obliges and paints yet another haunting musical masterpiece in colors of earth and sky.","classification":5,"fold":6}

Beverly has also starred in many theatrical productions, most notably, Hair and The Me Nobody Knows on Broadway, and The Rocky Horror Show and Menopause the Musical in Los Angeles. She has performed in clubs and concerts all over the world, as well as on talk\/variety shows such as The Tonight Show, The Merv Griffin Show, The Mike Douglas Show, and American Bandstand.\n\nIn May 1971 Scepter records released \"Don't Say You Don't Remember\".  Deliberately styled to evoke the 1960's \"girl-group\" sound the tune peaked at #10 on Billboard's Easy Listening chart while just failing to cross over to the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart. In a rather unusual turn of events Scepter was about to release the follow-up single when \"Don't Say You Don't Remember\" belatedly became a local smash in San Jose with enough subsequent interest in other markets to debut at #98 on the Hot 100 in December 1971. The song would peak at #15 nationally in February 1972.  I loved this record the very first time I heard it and it continues to be one of my favorite singles from the 1970's.

At almost 8 and a half hours, it includes many of the polonaises, etudes, mazurkas, waltzes, concerti and sonatas that make up a major portion of Chopin's canon.  Other recognizable pieces are included, such as the 4 ballades, the Barcarole in F-sharp major (Op. 60), the Bolero in C major (Op. 19) and the Fantasie in F minor (Op. 49).  Sound quality is good to very good.\n\nFor those obsessed with not having any duplication of downloaded works, a good portion of the tracks that are included here are also on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-99-Most-Essential-Chopin-Masterpieces\/dp\/B002XNI37E\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The 99 Most Essential Chopin Masterpieces<\/a>.  Both are produced by the X5 group, and some are not just the same pieces but the exact same recordings.  A good example would be the nocturns, all of which are the same tracks that are performed by Peter Schmalfuss and included in the other set.  So if you own the other set, that may deter you from purchasing this one.\n\nBut as a purchaser of the other set, I think this collection is well worth purchasing despite the duplication.  Here we have an additional ballade as well as the lion's share of etudes from Opus 10 and 25.  Here we have an additional polonaise from Opus 61.  The Sonata in G minor for cello and piano, tracks 39-42, is a new addition to this set.  The other collection includes the Sontas in B-minor and B-flat minor for piano from Opus 35 and Opus 58.\n\nWhile most of the same nocturnes are here, we have lost 2 from Opus 27.  The mazurcas include additions from Opus 6, Opus 50, Opus 56, and Opus 67, while we have lost movements from Opus 7, Opus 17, Opus 33, Opus 41, Opus 59, Opus 63, and Opus 68.  There is a similar mix and match of waltzes, with the subtraction of waltz number 2 from Opus 70 and the addition of waltz number 3 from Opus 64.  Preludes numbers 6, 8 and 17 have also been added from Opus 28, while number 2 has been left out.\n\nThere is an argument to be made that the other collection includes better quality performances.  A good portion of the pieces that are duplicated are interpreted by different musicians and orchestras.  Concerti 1 and 2 for piano and orchestra, for example, are performed here by the Tbilisi Symphony Orchestra while the better known recording by the Hamburg Symphony Orchestra and Abbey Simon is including in the Essentials compilation.  And the waltzes are performed by Dubravka Tomsic, while the Essentials collection includes a mix of performances by Abbey Simon and Dubravka Tomsic.  Yet all the performances in this set are of a high enough caliber for any lover of classical piano music to enjoy.\n\nI only have one minor complaint as it pertains to the sound.  While I enjoyed the ballades as performed by Freddy Kempf, there seems to be a  resonance in the way they were recorded.  I don't think it detracts from the recording, but it is noteworthy.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWhile perhaps 30 to 40 percent of this collection is comprised of the same pieces from the Essentials collection, the majority of those are by different performers.  And the flow has been much improved with the additional works that bridge the included ones.  While the other collection includes great performances, there are not too many things to complain about here.  This is a great collection for lovers of Chopin and classical piano. Enjoy.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"The Endless River is a pleasant surprise.  I anticipated a boring relaxed album based on the reviews.  There's three ways to interpret this album.  One is that it's a pretentious\/overblown attempt at something important which rubs many people the wrong way.  Two is that there's not enough actual musical ideas taking place.  Fair point I suppose.  And three, where I stand, is that the worst thing this album does is occasionally repeat some of the bands previously successful ideas such as the drum solo in \"A Saucerful of Secrets\", the sax solo in \"Us and Them\" and most importantly and obviously, the guitar solo at the end of \"Comfortably Numb\".\n\nIn fact most of the guitar playing is strikingly similar to the solo in \"Comfortably Numb\" but tamer, and the music overall follows world music more so than other Floyd albums.  If you like soaring guitar solos in the same style as the bands late 70's albums but slightly quieter, you'll certainly enjoy this album.  The way the songs flow directly and cohesively into the next makes it feel like you're listening to one long track.  For the most part the Endless River is an instrumental album, and the one noticeable weak point is when the vocal melody comes in near the end, and the clunky\/uninspiring 6 minutes before this vocal melody arrives.  Otherwise Pink Floyd shows why they were once the most unique rock band of the 70's and I honestly think this is the best album Pink Floyd made since A Momentary Lapse of Reason.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Jaheim came out on the scene pretty strong, selling double platinum with his debut album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ghetto-Love\/dp\/B00005899K\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ghetto Love<\/a>&nbsp;and then platinum with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Still-Ghetto\/dp\/B00006WKYJ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Still Ghetto<\/a>. And when his last album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ghetto-Classics\/dp\/B000BJ7CCY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ghetto Classics<\/a>&nbsp;only managed to go gold, things looked a little troublesome. This is especially true since Ghetto Classics was just as good as its predecessors, but Jaheim didn't get the push he deserved from his label and failed to chalk up the numbers he used to get in his prime. Now with Atlantic Records as his new label home, Jaheim hopes to re-up and capture the attention of his original fan base and millions more with his new album The Makings Of A Man. He keeps the formula the same for the most part, resorting to mid-tempo grooves and slow cuts for the majority of the album. After professing his worth with the intro track \"Voice of R&B.\" Jaheim lays it down with \"Hush,\" a song about keeping an affair with a homie's girl on the low. \"Have You Ever\" rides out with strong background vocals, simple piano work, and lyrics about speculating on what could have been and rethinking what has already been done. \"Lonely\" is a reworking of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Bobby-Womack\/dp\/B00004SATU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bobby Womack<\/a>'s \"If You Think You're Lonely Now,\" using the infamous hook for the song but changing the lyrics to reflect Jaheim's own tale of scooping up the next girl and her man is the one sitting at home all alone! \"Life of a Thug\" is a depiction of Jaheim's life in the form of an autobiographical song, describing all the trials and tribulations that he's faced over the years and his ultimate redemption from those trying times. He questions why a lover doesn't realize a good man when he's right in your face on the song \"Just Don't Have A Clue.\" For the track \"She Ain't You,\" Jaheim borrows the melody and background from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Delphonics\/dp\/B000EMGJTK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Delphonics<\/a>' classic \"La La Means I Love You\" for another reworking where he talks about his former girl still having his heart and wishing he could still be with her instead of anyone he's been with since losing her. Jaheim hangs up his player status for the love of his life on the album's lead-off single \"Never.\" \"I've Changed\" features the dynamic rawness of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Keyshia-Cole\/dp\/B000VDDCHO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Keyshia Cole<\/a>&nbsp;alongside his ghetto bravado, but the ridiculously child-like delivery of the chorus ultimately kills the song. Jaheim gets real on \"What You Think Of That\" where he describes realizing the true essence of a woman who was disrespected and unappreciated by a fool who didn't know what he had. \"Make A Wish\" is a smooth yet simple song about giving his girl whatever she wants and dreams of having, something every woman wishes were true! The album closes with the tender cut \"Back Together Again,\" a tribute to his parents who are now reunited in Heaven. Jaheim took his time with Makings Of A Man, and it truly shows in practically every track. If this doesn't convince the masses that he is the real thing, then this will certainly prove that people don't know true R&B talent when they see it...let alone hear it.","classification":4,"fold":6}

{"text":"Hinder released All American Nightmare in 2010. This is the bands third record, and their second in which they venture into late 80's styled hard rock. Many original fans of the band complain they forgot their roots, however, I am more than thrilled with their journey into melodic sounding metal.\n\nAll American Nightmare boasts a pretty decent set of hard rock songs, but like most modern American bands, Hinder rely heavily on ballads for radio play. I can't damn the guys for this course, everybody knows hard rock radio would sooner crank out Rooster, or Smells Like Teen Spirit every ten seconds, before they would play some newer bands like Crashdiet or Hardcore Superstar. My favorites from the album are Striptease, 2 Sides 2 Me, All-American Nightmare, Hey Ho and Put That Record On.\n\nI really recommend this record to any fan of hard rock music, and if you have never given Hinder a listen because you thought they were too modern sounding, give All American Nightmare a listen.","classification":4,"fold":6}

Indeed there are great moments here and there, some great passages and riffs but not much critical mass. Just a few good songs, i must sadly admit.\n\nI also agree that the solos of a keyboard wizard are missing. Isn't Yes about 'Kick ass' burning keyboard solos?\n\nHowe plays beautifully, but the songs are indeed kind of hollow and too simple for my taste after knowing what Yes can do musically.... You will freakin see what i am talking about.  It sounds a bit like Drama, but is nowhere near that great album.\n\nThis record lacks Deepness as a unit, the Yes deepness which has been lost for quite a while.","classification":2,"fold":6}

{"text":"There is honestly a difference between a songstress, and a singer who has really been overexposed to where their music is not even worth listening to anymore, because they are severely overplayed and overexposed. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles is one of those singers, who has came off more like a product than a real songstress of the heart. Sadly, the quality of her music has slowly passed away from the heart, and instead she has just relied on the severe over-demand of bigger has to be better, just like Michael Jackson did. Unfortunately, the quality of her work has caused her to lose her voice at the heart of the matter. Her songs like 7\/11 from her Beyonce' Platinum Edition album have faltered badly. The song 7\/11, definitely is one of her worst songs on the record, and shows that she has relied too much on being a dance diva to where her voice has suffered a setback in the soul. I found this song to be absolutely annoying, and shows the worst at her own work. Beyonce' honestly needs to grow up and find better than being a product. Her success at her own work, like her voice has died.\n\nSong: F+","classification":1,"fold":6}

{"text":"It is honestly so sad that someone young and talented has not really made the mark that they had made, to make the music in their life come alive. Ciara, who has had a lot going for her musically and personally the past several years, is one of those singers. She honestly has had a lot of lackluster songs from her past few albums that really have lost her voice in the wind, and not driving her heart to where her voice should really be. Her last album self-titled has had some lackluster songs from Body Party and Sorry, were not really as strong as she would've wanted them to be. Her latest song, Dance Like We're Making Love, the second single from her Jackie record, isn't actually as strong as her earlier songs like Goodies, and Love, Sex & Magic shown. I really didn't find the chemistry to drive into the song, in the way she wanted it to be.  I think Ciara should really take more time into her work, than rush her work out, like the overexposed Beyonce' Knowles. Hopefully, there will be better with Jackie coming around.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":6}
