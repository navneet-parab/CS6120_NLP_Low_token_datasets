{"text":"It kind of sounds like the French's answer to folk music, and as such it is rather intriguing.  It doesn't hurt that the vocals are alluring and the musicality is quite interesting, with obvious French playfulness (the horns are delicious) coating the more structured string arrangement.  The only thing I dislike here is that it becomes overwhelmingly repetitive in the end.  The chorus is also so blandly constructed (merely repeating \"how do you ruin me\").  So, the beautiful vocals and the original musicality is diminished by the uninspired lyrical content.  Still, there is no denying that Black Prairie drips style all over the place, and so I'm intrigued by them.\n\nI will be listening to more from them, I just hope that the bulk of their work is less redundant.","classification":3,"fold":4}

I heard of them through a friend of a friend, and at the time I was going through an indie splurge at the time so I listened to them right away. The music was fantastic, and I quickly recommended them to other friends. Sure enough, the fire caught on quickly and most of my friends were fans.\nBut then Cities came out and totally wiped their previous albums clean. They're both good, and I have some friends who still prefer the second out of pure nostalgia, but Cities as a whole was far above their previous work.\n\nSo how could they possibly top that?\n\nAnswer: they can't. Once you go above and beyond something fans will always compare your next work to what they consider your best. It's just simple habit.\nNow, Dark Is the Way is by no means bad; in fact, it's very good. It just doesn't capture the energy or detailed lyricism as their previous albums (namely Cities, of course).\n\nI have to emphasize that this is still a very good album, and \"Pray Tell\" is one of my favorite Anberlin titles from all their works.\nYou get more varied sounds here, noted by Anberlin's curiosity in incorporating different tunes and styles in their forte. Some work, some don't (but are still good), and the end result is a mixture of the very good to the okay.","classification":4,"fold":4}

The interesting track, \"The Lazy Song\" : has great guitar chords & drums combination with beautiful matching vocals. Has simple beautiful but very effective\/matching lyrics. \"Marry Me\" is a solid track\/gem : a wonderful pop song, great 'racy' drumming with great high range vocals & lyrics are highly persuasive. \"Talking To The Moon\" is a laid-back track : great grand piano with matching vocals. \"Count On Me\" is a great pop song : great guitar & hand drums combinations with great vocals. The closing track, \"The Other Side\" is a good pop\/hip hop\/soul track featuring the talented Cee-Lo Green & B.o. B. (he rapping rather well).

Each song touches on a need to escape or accept the circumstance that this environment seems to have created.

{"text":"Coming off of a classic first album, we see that Sister Arie remains a fine musician\/singer and the music on this new disc definitely showcases her talents on these fronts.  The grooves swing, the album is mixed incredibly tight and the arrangements are great. The changes are solid and the vocals even better than on her first record.\nBut you know how an artist's intentions can be TOO clear?  The messages too in-your-face?  How a poem or song or book can make you TOO conscious of the fact that you're partaking in listening or reading and not simply allowing the art to flow over you and take you away?  That's what's wrong here.\nThe problem I have is with the lyrics: they're WAY too preachy.\nI thought that the music was so well-done that I would be able to circumvent the lyrics here and there just to have something to groove to like I do with half the stuff on the radio, but that's turned out to not be the case.  A song will come in with a great beat, great harmonizing and great arrangements for about 20 seconds and then you're inundated with Sunday School-level lessons for three minutes.  Where's the risk-taking of \"Brown Skin\" or the gutsy self-confidence of \"Video\"?  Where's the humanity of \"Ready for Love\" or the philisophical punch of \"I See God In You\"?  It's just not there this time around.  It's almost as if she's heard so many people tell her that her first record was so positive that it's hamstrung her from taking too many chances on this record with the messages.  This album is cursed with the kind of \"We Are the World\" heavy-handedness that ruined the better part of the Lauryn Hill live record earlier this year.\nGreat playing mired in WAY heavy-handed and too-simple lyrics.  The musical equivalent of an Iyanla Vanzant seminar, which is unfortunate because her first album was a classic and a much-needed shot in the arm of a musical arena saturated with negativity.  This, however, is too far at the other end of the love\/hate spectrum.  If I wanted a gospel album, I'd have bought a gospel album.  She's clearly fallen in love since the last record as well, which is fine, but because of that there's a lot of not-great sap here too.  Not even racy, midnight-mood, slow-jammy sap...it's just simplistic I'm-in-love type stuff that, lyrically, you could get anywhere.\nThe shining track here is \"The One\" but it's not enough to justify buying the record if you liked the risks and confidence of her first record.  This is all a terrible shame; I wanted to like this one, especially after the constant robbing of Arie by the year of (groan) Alicia Keyes, but this record falls short in the most important department: the message.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"Thank goodness lead singer Lou Gramm returned to Foreigner for this album. The band's star frontman had left the group for a solo career after 1987's \"Inside Information.\" They replaced him with new singer Johnny Edwards, and recorded 1991's \"Unusual Heat.\" But the album was both a commercial & artistic disappointment, and all Lou Gramm managed to get out of his solo career was one lone hit single, \"Midnight Blue,\" and not much else. I guess both parties realised the error of their ways, because, very thankfully, Gramm and Foreigner guitarist Mick Jones ultimately made up, and reformed Foreigner for 1995's \"Mr. Moonlight.\" And while the album isn't Foreigner's masterpiece, it sure blows \"Unusual Heat\" right out of the water, thanks in no small part to the great return of Lou Gramm to the fold, both as lead singer and co-songwriter. I had a big smile on my face listening to \"Mr. Moonlight\" for the first time---this is the REAL Foreigner that I know & love. By this time, bassist Rick Wills & drummer Dennis Elliott had both split, so they were replaced by Bruce Turgon & Jeff Jacobs, plus various session players. The resulting \"Mr. Moonlight\" is a great return to form for Foreigner, with excellent songs all throughout, just like the band made in their glory days up through 1987. Highlights: the opening \"Under The Gun\" has Foreigner throwing down the gauntlet with tremendous rockin' power, \"Until The End Of Time\" is an instant classic power ballad, and the band get totally down & dirty with \"Big Dog,\" with a gloriously sleazy vibe and ominous lead vocals (but is it Gramm or Jones at the mike? I can't be sure). \"All I Need To Know\" has wonderful melody, \"Hole In My Soul\" is a strong acoustic-flavored thumper, and the final song, \"Hand On My Heart,\" is both beautiful & soulful. The hooks are memorable, the band's musicianship cooks, Mick Jones serves up some tasty guitar licks, and, God bless him, Lou Gramm's powerful voice is firmly at the forefront of Foreigner once again. Like I said in my review of \"Unusual Heat,\" Foreigner *needed* Lou, and \"Mr. Moonlight\" is the proof of that. Unfortunately, even with Lou Gramm back onboard, \"Mr. Moonlight,\" for all of it's great material, followed \"Unusual Heat\" to the commercial dud department, and gave the band no hit singles. I can only guess that the whole rock music biz had changed by 1995, and just wasn't the same since Foreigner ruled the roost in the 70's & 80's. Nirvana had already come & gone, and radio & music buyers in general just weren't interested in \"Mr. Moonlight,\" which is a shame. Although Foreigner continues to tour occasionally, there's been no new recorded material since the release of \"Mr. Moonlight\" eight years ago (at the time I'm writing this). If \"Mr. Moonlight\" really is the final Foreigner album, then at least the band has gone out on top with a fine record. \"Mr. Moonlight\" is a great Foreigner album. And thank you Mick, Lou, and the boys for all of the great music you've given your fans, myself included. I'll be rocking to your albums until the end of time!","classification":4,"fold":4}

Just like on his solo albums from the 70s, Ronnie rounds up a bunch of superstar friends like Slash, Bobby Womack, Flea, Billy Gibbons, Darryl Jones, Ian McLagan, and many others to join in. The result is highly satisfying. He chooses to lead off with a ballad, Why You Wanna Go And Do A Thing Like That For, because it's really good. Most of the songs touch on the ending of his long-time marriage to Jo, which fell apart from Ronnie's philandering and drinking. Sweetness My Weakness, Lucky Man, and Thing About You are from a man who knows what he's lost and why he lost it. The best track is Spoonful, with Slash, and it pounds like a jackhammer and is probably one of the best rock versions of the song. Sure, there are throwaway tracks; there always are on Ronnie Wood albums. But all in all it's a lot of fun and good times, and this is one party that you shouldn't miss.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Title notwithstanding, this is the warmed over lovechild of Eminem Show and Recovery. Evil Twin is worth a download, Brainless is a nice callback to early aughts em, and Survival is a good workout song. I also appreciate the lyrical skill on display in Rap God, and the moody euro-pop experiment of Beautiful Pain (Deluxe edition). These songs are good, but not great. And, as a whole, the album never finds a tonal, sonic, or thematic footing. Rather, it careens from faux-Shady shock (a-hole) to chick-friendly pop (monster) to maudlin confessional (headlights, stronger than I was) to sterile throwback (Berzerk) to three other odd, Rick Rubin-produced, \"what if Eminem did classic rock karaoke on acid?\" thought experiments brought to life. Devoid of a guiding sound or ethos, the album checks various self-referential boxes from the Eminem canon (the Stan sequel, the Kim song, the song about mom, the overcoming-adversity anthem) and flits and flirts around with a range of sounds and subgenres. This keeps us off-kilter, but never gives us much to sit and chew on--or bob our heads to, for that matter.\n\nI give Eminem credit for his versatility, as he dabbles in a range of sounds, styles, and moods, consistently demonstrating his ability to assert his dominance over any kind of beat, stacking and interleaving complex rhyme schemes like some kind of verbal Jenga game. I also applaud the experimental aspects of the album: Most of the songs he puts together are weird mashups or left turns that I can't imagine any other rapper even trying out. I have no doubt that these are exactly the songs he wanted to put on this album, and no one can deny his sheer lyrical skill on display here.\n\nEven so, mc'ing is more than just stacking syllables. It's style, tone, beat selection, storytelling, substance, collaborators, and overall album cohesion. In all of these areas, he and this album are adrift, and that is why less technically gifted rappers have made better albums this year (Prodigy, GFK, Czarface). A \"borderline genius who's bored of his lines,\" Eminem lacks focus and seems to have little new to say. Rather, he's locked himself in an echo chamber, only to keep sanding familiar themes (addiction, the isolation of pop superstardom, his mom, his dad, Kim) down to the nub, experimenting with different kinds of beats, and losing himself in increasingly self-indulgent verbal calisthenics.\n\nThe commitment to lyricism and willingness to experiment with different sounds give me both hope and concern.\n\nIf Eminem can\na) settle down with a set of core producers, preferably Alchemist and Dr. Dre (or a meaningfully engaged executive producer to shepherd things)\nb) rein in some bad habits (enough with the puns already)\nc) find some new subject matter to explore (it could be entirely fictional storytelling)\nd) collaborate with some other great rappers, perhaps\n\nThere is still hope for him.\n\nIf he continues to\na) choose poppy, electronic beats and...well, Rihanna\nb) work with Rick Rubin (sounds so great in theory so disappointing in end product)\nc) rhyme as a purely technical exercise\nd) go all over the place conceptually or sonically\ne) keep recycling the same old themes (addiction, woman trouble)\n\nWe're in trouble.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"So I was jamming this and found it really pleasant, checking out the different studio moods captured through the vocal EQ'ing and the drum mix, and thought Alabama Shakes was a phenomenal new band and even looked forward to catching them live.\n\nThen the track \"This Feeling\" came on.\n\nWhat a deflating thing it is to realize that a band feels it's necessary to provide homages to others when people should be paying homage to them. \"This Feeling\" is an atrocity halfway between Radiohead's excruciating \"We Suck Young Blood\" (where the vocalist's worst eccentric tendencies are mixed in the center of your ear amid a clicky\/clappy percussion rake that sounds like Chinese water torture on the forehead) and Prince's self-parodying later career missteps (take your pick of amusements).  It destroyed all the album's positive momentum to hear this song because it made me question just what exactly this band is trying to accomplish here, because everything after that track became shockingly derivative and \"experimental\" for the sake of being so.  Following \"This Feeling\", we get (in order) the murkily-mixed \"Numero Group song\" (\"Guess Who\", a disaster), the \"rave-up song\" (\"The Greatest\", which has no energy at all and nearly falls apart mid-song with a genuinely clumsy and ill-advised attempt at garage-rock), the \"Some Girls song\" (\"Shoegaze\", which would fit in nicely between \"When The Whip Comes Down\" and \"Just My Imagination\"), the \"Daptone song\" (Miss You\", or wait, was that the one that fits on \"Some Girls\"?), and a wet-noodle closer twofer of \"Gemini\" (a \"jam\"... so sad to see a band waste real estate with a song like this) and the genuinely depressing \"Over My Head\", which trades conviction and excitement for a claustrophobic and boring \"artistic statement\".\n\nIt sure is a shame to hear a band that came out of the gate so mightily resort to painting with other artists' colors, but I guess everyone goes through a \"we really like ______ lately and here's our _______ track\" stage. But it's even worse to hear it happen when the results are either such a pale attempt to replicate or make no attempt to be Alabama Shakes.\n\nThis album could have been a 5-song EP and blown my doors off. Instead, it honestly sounds front-heavy and filler-laden and isn't very memorable.","classification":3,"fold":4}
{"text":"Sleeze Beez were another in the long list of decent bands from the late 80's\/early 90's that never achieved the success they deserved. While they had everything needed to succeed, for whatever reason, they just never got there.\n\n\"Insanity Beach\" is Sleeze Beez's third and final album. With the release of \"Insanity Beach\", Sleeze Beez took a more harder rocking approach than with their previous releases. Gone is the Def Leppard sound alikes, and in it's place is a more modern hard rock sound. Now don't get me wrong, this album still has that Sleeze Beez sound, it just doesn't have that over-the-top catchiness that \"Screwed, Blued & Tattoed\" and \"Powertool\" had. The album does contain some filler, but the good far outweighed the bad. My favorite tracks from the album are \"Tell It To The Judge\", \"The Long Goodbye\", \"Save Myself\", \"Scream\" and \"Gun Culture\".\n\nThe worst thing about this album is, it's almost non-existent for some reason. I know it was released only in Japan, but come on, where in the world is Rock Candy or Wounded Bird??? Thankfully Amazon.com has it for download for a reasonable price, otherwise most people would never get to hear this great record.","classification":4,"fold":4}

There are songs I rate more highly, and I save four and five stars for those (only 8 songs in my entire collection rate 5 stars)\n\n\"Blue Morning, Blue Day\" is in my opinion, the second best track on Foreigner's \"Double Vision\" album. (second only to the title track and better than the more popular \"Hot Blooded\".)  Like much of Foreigner's early work, it is powered by memorable guitar riffs combined with strong pop hooks.  Lou Gramm and Mick Jones were songwriters, unlike many of their more album-oriented contemporaries.  This has always caused them some undeserved disrepute in a album-oriented rock\/progressive art rock community.  In an era dominated by disco, Foreigner was one of the few rock acts that managed to make it onto the pop charts.\n\nIf you were a rock fan living in the late 1970s, this song definitely belongs in your collection.  If you are too young to have remembered that era, the two more recent bands I consider to be most like Foreigner are Matchbox Twenty and Toad the Wet Sprocket with maybe a little bit of similarity to the Foo Fighters.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"I was extremely pumped for Metric's newest release and was counting down the days until its official release. After the band's past few releases of excellence I was sure this would be another great addition to their catalogue and, well....it's different, I'll give them that. Different can certainly be good and I have no problem with a rock band going more electronic. Bands like U2, Radiohead, Muse and The Flaming Lips have all done it effectively but the difference is that they have the songs to back it up. In Metric's case there's a lot of production flash but very little in terms of memorable songwriting.\n\nLet me start by saying I love the production on this album. From the various synthesizers and keyboards to the computerized beeps and loops, it's a rich palate of sounds and textures to explore. With each spin I find myself catching something new, immersed in the dirty electronic world they've created. Emily's voice sounds great as usual and the passion is still there. Unfortunately none of that matters when the songs themselves are rather dull and undercooked. There are a few gems sprinkled here and there, such as \"Fortunes\" and \"Too Bad, So Sad\", which is about as close to an actual rock song as Pagans in Vegas gets. \"The Shade\" isn't too shabby either and \"Celebrate\" is a bit of a grower. Aside from that the rest of these tunes are boring at best and forgettable at worst. Lyrically and musically there are so many repetitive tracks that fail to connect, even after repeated listens. \"Lie Lie Lie\" wears out its welcome after two minutes and both parts of \"The Face\" close the album with a dull instrumental suite that ultimately leaves me more baffled than satisfied.\n\nPagans in Vegas isn't a bad album but neither is it a great one. I've listened to it repeatedly and I'm struggling to find anything truly great on this LP. I'm fine with Metric trying something more electronic but they need the songs to make it work. They don't have that here and no amount of studio magic can make up for it.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"Three years before his untimely passing in 2002, Waylon Jennings spent a few days laying down what would be his last studio performances. Recorded in his friend (and steel guitarist) Robbie Turner's home studio, the tapes featured Jennings and his guitar working out new music and revisiting older tunes. Jennings no longer had the full vocal power of his earlier years, but his phrasing, tone and low baritone notes were intact; he sounds physically weakened in spots, but still mentally charged. Shortly after the sessions, Jennings moved back to Phoenix, and the tapes sat unfinished until last year, when Turner gathered select players to add instrumental backings to the performances. The result closely captures the flavor of Jennings' earlier recordings, skillfully weaving the players around Jennings and his guitar into a final mix that feels whole.\n\nBy utilizing players who'd worked with Jennings before, Turner was able to craft backings that are sympathetic to the singer and his sound. As with Johnny Cash's American Recordings, there's an unmistakable specter of mortality coloring the songs and performances. The title track is unapologetic, summing up Jennings' last stand with the hook line \"if I can't go down rockin', ain't gonna go down at all.\" There's also a fired-up early run-through of \"Never Say Die,\" which would become the title of Jennings last live set in 2000. Earlier songs take on added poignancy, such as a version of \"I Do Believe\" that's sung wearily, as if struggling to balance the hear-and-now with a here-after that was closing in. Similarly, \"Belle of the Ball\" is rendered more wistful and nostalgic here than as originally heard on 1977's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ol-Waylon\/dp\/B002YXUU38\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ol' Waylon<\/a>.\n\nHearing these songs as life-end reflections is partly a product of hindsight. Jennings then-new \"Friends in California\" would have been the story of a wounded spirit in 1970, but looking back at 1999 from 2012, the protagonist's troubles read more prophetic and terminal. Similarly, the romantic resignation of \"The Ways of the World\" is layered with additional meaning as Jennings contemplates \"the ways of this whole world are not always fair \/ most things are never what we want to find,\" and Turner dresses this latter song in steel guitar and atmospheric interludes that underscore the song's pondering. Arriving ten years after Jennings passing, this set is like a letter delayed in the mail; it's unexpected, enjoyable and bittersweet. 3-1\/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

{"text":"Bob has thrown plenty of curve balls throughout his career. His fans should be used to it by now. And here comes another one!\n\nShadows In The Night is not classic Bob or anything at all what you would expect, but then, the unexpected is what you expect from him. Now I'm confused. So is this classic Bob or not? Bob has been mining the past for a long time (even going back to the 60s) so this genre foray is consistent with Bob's art and career. Don't try to compare it to Blonde On Blonde, or even Tempest. It's one of those stand-alone brilliant moments that are, well, classic Bob.\n\nWhat it isn't is the kind of faithful renditions that we heard on Christmas From The Heart. There, Bob followed the template of Christmas albums that your parents had in the 50s - Mitch Miller, Bing Crosby and the like. On Shadows In The Night, Bob doesn't use strings or a big band like Ol' Blue Eyes did. The arrangements are remarkably understated. When horns are in the mix, they are muted. An upright bass and guitar strum in the background. A pedal steel replaces the strings. Pedal steel? Yes, this sounds like Frankie Goes To Nashville!\n\nHow does Bob's voice hold up? Certainly, he's no Sinatra and he doesn't try to be. But this is his best vocal effort in a long time. As I've listened to  his voice deteriorate over the past several years, I had my reservations about this. But Bob stretches his vocal limits only a handful of times, and not enough to make you cringe. You have to get past trying to compare Bob to Frank, and take these songs for what they are - Bob singing some old crooner songs in his own style, backed by a country band.\n\nOne of the two-star reviewers asked, \"How many times are you really going to listen to this?\" Fair question. I had my concerns too. As I carried the CD to the cashier, I wondered if I would listen to it once, maybe twice, then file it away.\n\nWell, I'm on my second straight listening. I don't know how many more times I will listen to it, but I think I might. I don't know if I'll ever have that \"gotta listen to this again\" feeling like I feel towards Tempest. It's possible it may languish in my CD rack. But for now, I think I will take the time to explore this. It's interesting. It's looking at the old songs in a new way.

It starts with a simple , almost latin melody, and Robert comes in quietly and without hurry.  His narrative is leading and his melody makes you feel as if there is actual movement.  His matter of fact delivery is in line with his more mature sensibilities and the desperate angst of his youth is replaced with tension but not desperation.  At the end the melody continues even after the singer has completed his part.  Is it symbolic?  It is to me and that is all I can say.","classification":4,"fold":4}

And boy, talk about good advice.\nSince \"Love Calls\" is the first single, it's probably also the most recognizable song on the album - but I don't know if I would necessarily say it's the best song. Not to say it isn't a great song, but there are other great tracks too, like \"Inside\" (no, it's not about sex) and the gospel-flavored \"This Place\". And \"Brotha Man\" is a great storytelling track.\nWith ten tracks at around 47 minutes, it's clear that Kem isn't a debut artist who's trying to overprove himself. And he doesn't need to, because every song on this album is great. So why isn't he getting the recognition he deserves? Probably because he's on Motown, the label that seems to only promote artists when they feel like it (see also Remy Shand). But hopefully Kem will soon sell several copies of this great release.","classification":5,"fold":4}

Unfortunately, Rihanna has been one of those washed-up singers who has been more like a robot in her voice, than really having anything that can match from the soul of the heart. Her latest set of songs has honestly been less than stellar in her voice, and it has shown to be more choppy and course, than elegant and intimate. Four Five Seconds, which she did with Paul McCartney and Kanye West really failed to deliver from the heart in every way. Bitch Better Have My Money, or BBHHM is honestly one of those songs that feels more whack than anything that really has delivered. I definitely think the song feels more like a waste of time, than sincerely a singer that knows she should be working it. I overall found the song to be one of her low points overall. It is not only a song I do not recommend, but if Rihanna keeps making songs like this, her career will drop dead.\n\nSong: F+","classification":1,"fold":4}

{"text":"This new one from foxy puts her back where she left off on Ill na na(her first cd) but in a whole new way. A lot of people thought she would fall off or come back weak on this but she came from left field with some of these tracks. This time she brought a lot of reggae, dancehall, some soca and even indian music to the plate. Some of the tightest tracks on this is where she raps with dancehall beats. Hearing foxy chant in jamacian puts her on a whole different level now and no other female mc right now can do it better. The way that she flows from rap to reggae makes it look a lot easier than it is. There is one song call \"so Hot\" where she shows her trini roots with a calypso style beat that sounds different to anything out now. Bk Anthem has one of the hardest and tightest beats that you can play on the set. On songs the leter she apologizes to her family and different people she hurt. On broken silence she lets you knwo what she has been goign through all this time. Fallin and 730 pust some rumors to an end liek jay-z writing some of her rhymes. She admits it saying \"Yeah I did, but I blew um up the same\". \"Tables will turn\" is anotehr tight song that I think is on of the tightest on the cd...produced by regage producer Dave kelly. In regage dave kelly is the equivalent of timbaland in hip-hop so she couldn't get any better with him. The songs I like the most are: Oh Yeah, Bk Anthem, The letter, 730, tables will turn, hood scriptures, run dem, na na be like, so hot, and teh saddest day.

{"text":"If you have a choice about which version you get, I recommend the CD AND Blu-ray version. The CD is great, beyond anything I could have possibly have asked for or expected. Why ? The journey you go on from side 1 ( as they call it), is pure delirium . This then takes you up a beat, and then through the light and shade that Pink Floyd are past Masters of, you get to Stephen Hawkings Cameo ( or his computers cameo), and then the journey resolves in  side 4 which finishes with the lyrical magic on louder than words. The reason for me that I got the most out of this is that a person very close to me passed away last month, and it feels like that is why I was ready to hear it, or as Dave says, you have to be in the mood to hear our work ( or words to that effect).\n\n  Where they take things to the whole next level  is that not only is the album in 5.1 surround on the blu-Ray, but the Audio Visual part has some great studio selections, which is blessed with an audio only version of one rock style tune( which you see in video in stereo) called NERVANA in 5.1 ( the audio bonus section is all in 5.1 for that matter). So you get extra material in a fabulous format.\n\n  Whatever you want to call it, this is music, and it is the kind that the best musicians on the Planet perform. This is the style that they have refined  and even when they use it with material from 1968 where Richard Wright played the Organ at the Royal Albert Hall and it is melded seamlessly with the new work, it works brilliantly .Both Side 1 and 2 felt healing for me, but thats me in my state of mind; I suspect that different people will get different things from this work. And as someone said in a different context, if you have ears to listen and a heart to feel, then this work will mean something very special to you. If this is the last Pink Floyd, then they have gone out on a brilliant album.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE: If you buy the CD\/BluRay Deluxe version, the Amazon Downloads will be of the Audio from the Blu-Ray Track range... which means 3 extra tracks on the Download, and this includes the rocker NERVANA.\nI noticed that recent reviews mention extra tracks ( 11\/17) ; kind of odd that the CD buyers never see the listings for the Blu-Ray, also the blu-ray is at a higher bit-rate and sounds much better, than the lower bit-rate DVD and CD. And as I noted here, it has extra tracks on download.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Official songs for major world sporting events like the World Cup or the Olympics need to accomplish a few things. They need to capture the significance of the moment, pay suitable tribute to the local culture, and project an  atmosphere of hope and brotherhood. On top of all that, they have to inspire a good atmosphere for just plain partying.\n\nJudged on these criteria, Shakira has done very well with \"Waka Waka\". It's a likeable tune with an African beat and singers, with plenty of South African-style guitar riffs, and it recognizes and celebrates the fact that Africa is hosting its first world sporting event on this scale. It hits all the bases on the party front as well!\n\nThis isn't an original song. The original version was by a band from Cameroon called Golden Sounds. It has been popular throughout Africa and also in Shakira's native Columbia. It has kind of silly lyrics about military matters, but also has kind of a serious aspect behind it, criticizing blacks who sided with whites in wars in Africa. Some of this comes through in the imagery from the original video, which is up on YouTube.\n\nBut the lyrics in English are new and reflect the military history of the song (\"you're a good soldier\", etc), but where the original was more or less a silly if satirical romp, the new lyrics put a noble, suitably inspiring spin on things. Pretty well done, actually.\n\nThe instrumentation is a little thin, and maybe a fuller sound could have provided more of an anthem-like, \"this is really a big deal\" quality. Also it falls just a little short on the inspiration front. Shakira checked all the boxes with this one, but it leaves us with a feeling that, well, she was checking the boxes. A little formulaic, but if it didn't follow the formula people would criticize that.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Like always, I couldn't wait to hear this album, and like the last 3 albums, it's been a huge disappointment. With that said tho, even the last couple of albums had a couple of songs at least I liked, but this album, I didn't take a liking to the title track when it was first played on the Letterman show back in November 2014, and its certainly the strongest track on this album. Yet still not something I personally want to listen to again.\n\nThe problem with this album is every song really does sound the same, with the same story, only the tempo changes. I admit, I'm not much of a country music fan, however a lot of what Kid has done in the past I have taken a liking to, but this album here, I just can't get into it. I may not have been a fan of the early Kid's rap\/hip hop days, but I was an instant fan when he went hard driving metal with in your face rap lyrics, and Kid's ventures into other genres made me like a few songs in genres i'd never really enjoyed before, but none of the stuff on this albums resembles any of that previous material. Probably the only song I almost liked on this was FOAD, but it just doesn't have a beat or the attitude I like.\n\nI'm still a Kid Rock fan tho, but I can see that Kid had previously had a lot of success mixing up what genre he can be classified as, but at least he had a bunch of genres on previous albums, but this idea to start making records instead of songs hasn't impressed me at all. Born Free just did not cut it for me, and the last album seemed like Kid was really starting to get it together again and I was hoping this album was going to be one of his best in years, but I can't see any of the songs on this album becoming greatest hits. Well, I know a few people really like the title track, and yes, it is probably the strongest track on this album, but to me personally, it's a 2 star song, not Kid at his finest, and then every song after seemed to just be the same story repeated again and again with generic music playing to it. No great riffs, stand out lyrics, big stand out chorus, memorable moments or something that just raises the adrenaline, not anything touching or sweet etc...etc...\n\nIf you're a country fan, you may appreciate this album, and be fairer towards it than I am. But if you're like me and you're more into the hard rock\/metal stuff, then I don't think you will enjoy this album very much at all. Be your own judge tho, as this is just my own personal opinion and this album not doing anything for me, as its not the genre I like, and didn't feel anything stands out as great at all, even for it's genre. I can't imagine anyone would disagree that had \"Picture\" come out now on this album, that song would have cast a huge shadow over the rest of this album and made everything else here feel like cheap filler. So if nothing can be compared to Kid's biggest country hit in the past, how can the songs on here be rated 5 out of 5 stars, on all tracks, giving this album a 5 star rating? Too many generous ratings from people who don't really put much thinking into what they rate these things other than \"I like it, therefor it deserves 5 stars\"... really? 5 stars, as in the same 5 star ratings given by the majority to say AC\/DC's \"Back In Black\" and all the other greatest albums of all time? So the people here giving it 5 stars are saying First Kiss is not only the best album Kid Rock has ever done, but it's also one of the best albums ever? Sorry, I give ratings that are deserved, not just the highest rating for a lazy vote and a comment saying, \"loved a few songs, didn't like this and that, but I rate it 5 stars anyway\"","classification":1,"fold":4}

{"text":"This band was formed in the Los Angeles area in 1977. During their time, they released 17 albums and sold about 40 Million of them. They received several Grammy awards. Their most successful album was their fourth one, 'Toto IV', released in 1982. It went triple Platinum. It spawned several singles, 'Africa' being one of them. The musical style is best described as pop rock. The performance is impeccable. The vocal harmonies are next to flawless. The tune is peppy and uplifting, motivating in a sense.

This track starts off slow and builds in intensity while maintaining a graceful tone.  I love the violins playing on this song. \"Nocturne\" is another beautiful slow track that I enjoy.  \"Clu\" and \"The Game Has Changed\" are two tracks with a  menacing sounding tone.  \"Clu\" is an intense sounding four minutes.  \"The Game Has Changed\" also has a powerful beat. I love both tracks. \"Solar Sailor\" is a subtle two and a half minutes. This track sounds very soothing to me. I love the upbeat and techno sound of \"Derezzed\". This track pumps me up with energy. \"Outlands\" has a frantic tone to it. \"Rinzler\" has a suspenseful tone to it that is enjoyable to listen to. I really love the variety of tones to this score.

{"text":"Before producer\/rapper Oddisee set his sights on blowing up Brooklyn and Arizona's Mello Music Group, he set Washington DC on fire, and before he took on our nation's capital, he was sizzling in his affluent Prince George's County, Maryland home base, all the time repping his \"P.G.\" stomping grounds and his multicultural makeup. The son of an African American mother and a Sudanese father, a young Oddisee (real name Amir Mohamed) would split his residency between Sudan and the U.S., witnessing the juxtaposition of the two civilizations firsthand as a small boy. Later in life, with the world at his fingertips, he couldn't ignore his hip hop calling with which producing, or making beats, became his forte. With the help of the legendary DJ Jazzy Jeff, the Low Budget Crew, Diamond District and many others, Oddisee gained national recognition and is now thriving to the nth degree with Mello Music.\n\nMaking beautiful music with Mello Music Group since 2008, Oddisee is still very much hungry as his ambition shines through in The Good Fight for 2015. A real hip hop wiseman, Oddisee is overflowing with his feelings on unconditional love, relationship ills and the losses in life. Streams and streams of poignant, pensive rhymes from this natural master of flow testify to an unflinching tortured soul who doesn't hold himself back in the least bit. Oddisee ebbs and flows through his music like the push and pull of everyday life. \"Want Something Done\" explains the blues and joys of being an underground artist, and \"Contradiction's Maze\" documents the tug of war between right and wrong. Like his lyrical heft, Oddisee's beats keenly display the rich delectability his musical style is known for. Elegant, organic music and samples make for soulful, mellow boom bap orchestrated by Oddisee's gentle, talented hand. The Good Fight is another impressive Oddisee album, progressive and very consistent for this intellectual man. It definitely helps Oddisee's evolution as an artist, though not by leaps and bounds.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"If this is still available at the Black Friday price then you should buy it, if only for the fact that it includes many excellent performances on authentic Baroque instruments.\n\nFirst lets get the Musici San Marco out of the way. This is a fictitious group that, on my old cheap CD (\"Vivaldi on Authentic Instruments\")were labelled as being conducted by Alberto Lizzio - rumoured to be a nom de plume of Alfred Scholz. The violinist, Josef Merten, is also likely to be fictitious. However the tracks here (as on my CD) reveal spirited and well recorded music making. Of course, these are now duplicates in my collection but I am prepared to put up with that because of the quality of the tracks generally, especially the two vocal\/choral pieces: Stabat Mater\" and the \"Magnificat\" - performed by Jakub Brurzynski, a Polish counter tenor and conductor of \"La Tempesta\".\n\nI note that a movement of the Stabat Mater was included in another BIS collection&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-99-Darkest-Pieces-Of-Classical-Music\/dp\/B0048NUUS2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The 99 Darkest Pieces Of Classical Music<\/a>. It is quite darkly done. with Brurzynski offering a darkly toned countertenor and ominous colours from the orchestra, appropriate for a piece which tells the \"Sorrows of Mary\", a mood which is continued in the short piece Sonata al Santo Sepolcro, RV 130. The \"Magnificat\" shows rather close microphone placing for the small (one voice to a part?) choir and a rather more energetic countertenor than in the Stabat Mater. I enjoyed this less than the other piece, finding Jakub Brurzynski's singing just a little too strident, even if technically sound. He is balanced, though, by some good singing from the women in the choral group. The orchestral playing is of a good standard. My final judgement on this is that it is enjoyable, if not at the highest of standards.\n\nI've discovered the excellent recorder playing of Dan Laurin on some other of these inexpesive offerings. Here he joins the Bach Collegium Japan and the Drottningholm Baroque Ensemble in some well recorded and spirited performances of well known Vivaldi flute concertos. The Drottningolm group also supports well known players Monica Huggett (violin) and Jakob Lindberg (Lute)as well as Nils-Erik Sparf on baroque violin (who also might actually lead this group). Sparf performs that old chestnut the \"Four Seasons\" in a performance that has been deservedly well reviewed elsewhere and is worth listening to, rather than skipping as \"just another four seasons\". His playing is accurate, spirited when needed and dark when appropriate.\n\nVon der Goltz is a famous name in the world of baroque music. Gottfreid has been the leader of the famous Freiberger Baroque Orchestra and it would seem that the Conrad von der Goltz Chamber Orchestra is named after (and led by?)his father. His sister, Kristin plays one of two cellos in the concerto RV531 in this compilation, joined by Ute Zimmermann in what is a delightfully and skilfully played rendition.\n\nThe London Baroque are an established group that are well respected in the world of authentic interpretation. This collection contains two pieces - the \"La Folia\" variations and the Sonata no 3, Opus 2 for violin and Bass Continuo. These are well played and satisfying interpretations that are recorded well.\n\nAgainst this background of excellent authentic recordings there are, unfortunately some disappointments. The recordings by Camerata Rhenania and the Janacek Chamber Orchestra do not match those of the other ensembles in this compilation. The recording of the Camerata is not of the same standard as the rest of the package here. There is coarseness in the upper register which makes for a tiring listening experience, even though the performances are adequate- using baroque trumpets by the sound of it in the concerto for two trumpets. The L'Estro Armonico Op3 piece played by them is similarly recorded and a rather turgid performance. The Janacek Orchestra also provides some lacklustre performances of the other L'Estro Armonico pieces. This is a rather old-fashioned style of performance, but the recordings are better than the Rhenania group and in the end I have gone past my initial reaction and quite like them. Modern instrument recordings and performances ofetn don't stand comparison with recordings on authentic instruments and in what is often a more spritely style that befits the dance origins of much of the music.\n\nThe St Petersburg Soloists provide another modern instrument performance with Vladimir Kurlin playing the Concerto for Oboe no 8 (Vivaldi wrote at least 20) - this is nicely played and stands well alongside the other recordings here.\n\nAs with most of these BIS collections there will be duplicates if you have other selections on your computer or MP3 player - for instance the Dan Laurin \"Il Gardelino\". In my opinion it's worth having a few duplicates. This collection is slightly higher priced than the traditional offer prices of these BIS collections (99c or $1.99) and will no doubt increase after the Black Friday period. If you look the range of pieces and what it would cost to buy these in their orginal forms then they can still be a good buy.\n\nIn conclusion this is a set that is worth a lot more than the price of a cup of coffee! The quality of the recordings and performances is in general high and a worthy addition to anyone's collection, even if they do have 10 other versions of the Four Seasons!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Bjork wasn't content in just starring in a movie she had to produce and write the music for the film, culminating in this soundtrack. Two words only are needed to sum up this soundtrack, Simply Beautiful. Bjork is such a musical genius, she is up in another league of women musicians, shared by only a select few.\n\nBut what makes Bjork such a wonderful musician is how she creates the most un believeable songs,whether it is an orchestral masterpiece (as shown on this album) or a sweeping ballad with a huge choir, Bjork has done that and much more.\n\nShe is in fact the most inventive musician there ever has been and ever will be. She is that good and this album proves it.\n\nThe first track to start this album is \"Overture\", well named as it is the overture to the film. This song starts with a deep string section and works its way into a fully rounded orchestral masterpiece. Bjork is well known for her use of orchestras in her music and this fully orchestra track is well worth the listen, because I don't really like classical music I was really ominous about this track, this is actually my favourite classical music piece ever.\"Cvalda\" is a really weird song, it starts off with about 1 minutes worth of machine and factory sounds the finally -Clatter,crash,clack,racket,bang,thump- the first lyrics are as suggestive as the rest of the song, which is all over the place and sonically loud. Catherine Denevue makes a worthy appearance on this song and adds to the excitement and energy. On the next track Bjork ropes in another musical genius, Thom Yorke of Radiohead to create quite simply the most moving track the album along with -New World-. Now this is the song that is credited with me first getting into Bjork. One morning I was watching a music video show and I saw the video for this song and I instantly went searching for it. This song is so amazingly beautiful. Thom and Bjork work so well on this duet. \"Scatterheart\" is quite lenghty but well worth the listen and it has the most wonderful electronic programming in it. It talks about hurricanes and how -you are going to have to find out for yourself- quite a lyrical muddle but it is very well written. \"In The Musicals\" is a very good song that starts off with a basketball like sound. The irony is that -Dancer In The Dark- is classed as a musical and this song is about just that. It's strangely empowering and encouraging. \"107 Steps\" is Siobhan Fallon counting her steps and Bjork cooing every random number that comes along. Then finally at 107 (Or is it 100)steps there is an orchestral explosion and everything goes fantastic. Again she ropes in another beautiful guest to accompany her. \"New World\" is the 7th and final song on the album, although this album is short it is well worth the listen. This track is AMAZING and I didn't realise it was this wonderful for a while, a great example of how songs can come to grow on you.\n\n10\/10. This album may be short but every track is fantastic.\n\nI thoroughly recommend this to anyone, of any age.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Forms of poetry are often logos of memes with positive flaws while songs have new kinds of sentences, considering my patience with time as though my eyes are actually the students for these ears under my hair.  Yes, and how many ears must one man have before he can hear people cry?  Dylans associations with mankind are fine because he stays loose and plays with syntax to get insight whether he uses plain English or not, so the intrinsic behaviors to his godly motives are fascinating if also miraculous of intellect as well as rarity.  Utter honesty is his best defense when visions are as light as air, contemplating here about the evolution of deaths even if my prosperity can never be considered the obvious return from my oral literacy or one special type of speech impediment.  Dylans accuracy of life portrayal isn't sketchy but quite a definitive reference to wisdom and proclamations which become ironic for possible answers thatd be too long.  The catch phrase Blowin in the Wind for me implies mystery of wisdom since torrents of weather really haunt peaceful armies before spelling out an unknown danger, being itself a collection of memes that form the real word in a society of slippery doves and washed mountains.  My favoritism of folk music is too my actualization of materialism with secondhand spirits during this sleepy discovery of rounds with musical notes, turning my exhausted body into a medium of reception in the causing sunshine near those musical videogame consoles.  Dylans courage is really his fear, very much in tune with his awkwardness of bravery at a moment here and there, performing with twisty physics; I can say more about this, and Dylans determination isn't usually his regret throughout song playing but promises in emotional terms.  His childish strength is his romantic reign of the songs pieces of advice relating to Earths likely devastations, so Dylans imbecility is cute yet truly serves as a warning symbol for doubt exaggeration.  Blowin in the Wind is a romantic chant because Dylan juggles ideas with infatuated meanings rather than observing an obvious thesis, and by getting to basic predictions he turns out to be a very unlikely hero.  Dylan can inscribe lyrics under purple light due to his abstractions with easygoing agony as well as vague demands, and he cuts a statement to the bone, living through reactions toward ordinary nature in his interesting admiration of defense.  Maybe rapid feedback from reviewers gets customers going, but I like to treat our reading as a chance for meditation instead of fashionable conversation attributed to busy people.  In fact, fashionable conversation attributed to busy people is a source of aliteracy.  By my phrase admiration of defense, Im describing what romance is in poetry.  Indeed, with answers blowing in the clouds around the bends of Dylans proclamations over historic references, I believe we need to be more confused about our learned behaviors since our knowledge of love may occasionally be a precipice to the darkness.  Yes, and how many times must a man look up before he can see the sky?  Blowin in the Wind refers to an answer; however, it may refer to a question in addition, so we can try to find statements in the air without having favorites that ruin vivid scenes or training aggravated nerves.  Its pretty neat to be called a friend after Ive realized my personal edification of sensation over mystery, so Dylans casual attraction to his notions is his gusto of his involved presence around quick-playing harmonicas as well as catchy tunes that play out the roles of a guardian over humanity, and its legal.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"\"Dry\" is P.J. Harvey's debut album, released in 1992 it was a critical success while it did modest on the commercial side of things. Harvey was a breath of fresh air to the industry and was that generation's Patti Smith. Her mixture of pounding riffs and raw vocals created one superb album, the multi-talented Harvey wasn't content with just singing she had to co-produce the album, play guitars and violin, and write all but two of the tracks (those two she co-wrote). There are standouts but the album is overall a solid effort and flows well.\n\nThe album starts with the simplistic \"Oh My Lover\", the track is simple yet effective and isn't an all-out assault on the ears. I really like the starkness in P.J.'s voice.\n\"O Stella\" seems a bit like a reprise of the previous track, though I do like this song better, it's shorter and does more musically, but that doesn't mean I hate \"Oh My Lover\".\n\nNext up is \"Dress\", I like the repitition in the lyrics and the double bass part which is played to perfection. The song has a very syncopated feel, even though at times an irregular feel.\n\"Victory\" is another great track with a nice echo section in it and some nice guitar parts. The bass is great, the drums are probably stronger than ever since the start of the album.\n\n\"Happy And Bleeding\" sounded like it had elements of country and folk in it upon first listen and I still can hear little elements of it, though not as much now, it's another great track though a bit of variation in the riffs would've be nice.\n\"Sheela-Na-Gig\" is one of the best songs on the album and the most successfull single off the album, the structure of the song is perfect, especially the 'I'm gonna wash that man right of my hair...' bit. I like the chorus, it's really catchy.\n\n\"Hair\" keeps the same formula that has made the album what it is and doesn't interrupt the flow at all. All the basic things are here, good lyrics, catchy hooks and superb instrumenation.\n\"Joe\" is another short track that is set at a very fast tempo, it seems to be gone and over really quick. It's still a nice track though.\n\n\"Plants And Rags\" is the best song on the album and seems a bit out of place on the album, I love the way the strings are used and written. This song is without a doubt the most emotional album on the album and P.J. proves her voice's potential well on this track.\n\n\"Fountain\" starts off incredibly lo-fi and then breaks into the signature sound of the album. I like the contrast and how it makes the song a bit segmented. \"Water\" has been described as the 'lightest' track off the album, although it does seem a bit light, it still has that punch about it. Great vocals by P.J. again.\n\nOverall, \"Dry\" is special, it retains it's rock-alternative sound while still displaying emotion and beauty. The two best tracks would have to be \"Plants And Rags\" & \"Sheela-Na-Gig\", simply because they well, standout. This album though is incredibly solid throughout and flows nicely making this an irresistable album by a true musical genius.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"It goes without saying that Roger Waters is a lyrical genius, and his latest work is no exception.  This is one of those albums that you really need to sit down with the lyrics and actually pay attention to what is being said.  It doesn't really work as simple background music while you're driving to work.  Much like \"Amused to Death\", Waters has nothing positive to say about our political leaders and the military industrial machine.  He clearly despises Trump, and it comes out numerous times throughout the album, including quotes from the orange fool himself.  \"Picture That\" is particularly vitriolic, as is the title track.\n\nUnfortunately, as great as the lyrics are, the music is rather mediocre.  Pink Floyd fans will notice that \"Deja Vu\" has elements of \"Mother.\"  \"Picture That\" sounds a lot like \"Sheep\" and \"Smell the Roses\" is basically a \"Have a Cigar\" rewrite.  Those are some of the highlights here.  What's really lacking though is the guitar punch of previous albums.  \"The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking\" had Eric Clapton and \"Amused to Death\" had Jeff Beck.  Not only does this album not have a great guitar player, it doesn't feature any memorable solos.  Many of the songs are acoustic with pretty simple arrangements.\n\nIf you're a Pink Floyd fan and are expecting another \"Dark Side\" or \"Wish You Were Here,\" you're going to be disappointed.  I'd recommend you get David Gilmour's last album instead.  If you loved \"The Final Cut\", though, you'll probably dig this.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"As one of the classic artists from the 90s, Brandy remains a staple in the collection of many R&B fans. Her departure from Atlantic Records meant a general belief that her project would receive greater investment from a new label. However, the album also went through several changes in the process, causing some of the material recorded early on to be scrapped. One of the major factors in this was a re-connection with long-time collaborator Rodney Jerkins, who had previously worked on both the Never Say Never and Full Moon albums. Also, due to personal turmoil from involvement in a car accident, Brandy understandably took some time off to collect herself during the creation of this album. However, this break gave her ample time to craft a cohesive and engaging album, which seems to be a true testament to what it means to be human.\n\nA spoken intro begins the album with Brandy defining what it means to be human, providing a brief but nice transition into the first song. \"The Definition\" is one of the more upbeat tracks the album has to offer, with Brandy sounding confident and happy as she sings about overcoming the past and finding love. The bridge in particular is a highlight, both lyrically and vocally. \"Warm It Up (With Love)\" is more of an inspirational track, talking about the need to warm up the world with love. Fans are often torn on this track, some calling it a favourite while others find it mediocre. However, this is the kind of track that makes its way into your head and remains there for days at a time. The bridge once again showcases Brandy at her best. The criminally underrated lead single, \"Right Here (Departed),\" follows, marking one of the albums strongest offerings. The track emphasizes how well Brandy and Darkchild work together, as it is a simply brilliant song. The production effortlessly highlights Brandy's vocal abilities, especially the toned-down instrumentation of the bridge. This track is arguably one of the best in Brandy's entire catalogue.\n\nThe same can be said for \"Piano Man\", another track that attests to the chemistry between Brandy and Darkchild. It is also one of the more unique tracks thematically, describing asking a DJ to play a song that can have \"the whole world singing,\" or in other words, something everyone can relate to. Once again, the bridge is the strongest part of the track, as it gives Brandy ample room to shine vocally. This is another one of the best tracks to come from Brandy's entire career. The \"Long Distance Interlude\" again provides a nice tie-in to the following track. Here Brandy calls her man to talk about how difficult it is to be in a long distance relationship. \"Long Distance\", the first true ballad of the album, uses just a piano and Brandy's passionate delivery to evoke the struggles of being away from a loved one. Many have criticized the choice of this song as a second single, believing it not to be accessible enough. Nevertheless, as an album track it certainly remains strong. \"Camouflage\", identified in a recent interview as one of Brandy's favourites off the album, is one that comes with an important message. Here, Brandy sings about love not being worthwhile when one has to change themselves for it to work. Compared to other tracks, this is more of a grower although its message is certainly one that needs to be heard.\n\n\"Torn Down\" is another track that may seem like filler at first, but soon gets stuck in the listeners' head. The vocals blend nicely with the production as Brandy sings about the strength of love. The bridge again is the highlight of the entire track. Although this is not the strongest offering on the album, it is by no means a bad song. Title track \"Human\" contains more subdued production that allows Brandy's vocals to be the primary focus. This track describes how Brandy is \"perfectly human,\" acknowledging that she'd made mistakes. This is one of the only tracks on the album that has Brandy credited as a writer, and it is clear that this is one of the more personal tracks. It has also been interpreted as one of the few that makes reference to the car accident. \"Shattered Heart\" describes giving one's heart to someone, yet asking them not to shatter it. The production on it takes on a darker tone that suits Brandy's voice quite well. The tempo change partway through the track certainly helps to keep it interesting and fresh. Brandy's delivery truly pulls the track together to make it another of the stronger offerings. \"True\" is a powerful ballad and yet another album highlight. The subdued production combined with the strong lyrics to showcase Brandy's passionate and emotive lyrics.\n\nThe ingenious \"A Capella (Something's Missing)\" uses only an electric guitar and Brandy's voice to create the entirety of the production. While many have deemed this one of the more forgettable tracks, credit must be given for taking such a risk. This song is a true testament to the range of Brandy's voice, and it is amazing what can be crafted even without complex production. It is true that this is not the most memorable song, however that only serves to strengthen its position as the hidden gem of the album to be re-discovered each time one listens. \"1st and Love\" is an addictive, more upbeat track about meeting a new guy. This is easily one of the catchiest offerings, prompting many fans to push for it to be a single. The sparse production again leaves Brandy plenty of room to shine, bringing all the emotion to the track with just her voice. \"Fall\" is yet another of the strongest tracks in Brandy's entire catalogue. Co-penned by Natasha Bedingfield, this track easily showcases all of Brandy's strengths. Both lyrically and vocally it is one of the best offerings on the album. Here Brandy sings about wanting to fall in love without the accompanying fear of trusting someone new. The bridge again is the strongest part of the song. As an added bonus, the album ends off with a brief a capella segment of \"Camouflage,\" providing a nice touch to close things off.\n\nOverall Mark: 5\/5\n\nThe only real problem with this album is the inexplicable lack of support it received from the label. The label failed to capitalize on the initial success of \"Right Here (Departed)\", creating long delays before the next single, and generally poor promotion. Despite, or perhaps because of, this album being a long time in the works, the final result is a stunning piece of work that showcases Brandy at her best. Many of her career highlights can be found on this album. Although she is only credited as a writer on a couple of tracks, it seems clear that Brandy was very much involved in the creation of the entire album. Upon first listen, one could easily assume that she had written much of the material herself, marking a true testament to her ability to connect with the tracks. Particularly baffling are criticisms which argue that the album is not \"radio-friendly\" enough, as many of the tracks seem as though they could easily be played alongside other singles of the time. Nevertheless, Brandy has once again created a consistent and powerful album. Regardless of sales or chart positions, with the material provided here, she has clearly demonstrated why she has nothing to prove.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"NME has called this song a country song . . . eh, not really. Although it does have a sort of twangy guitar arrangement; I call it Western rock if it's anything at all to do with a country vibe. This is my favorite song on the album; it's even my girlfriend's favorite song at the moment (and she's only a moderate Linkin Park fan). The song starts off with a hypnotic chugging of a steam engine-esque tempo and builds with a folk--almost country or western--guitar arrangement (it could be keyboard; it's hard to tell with LP). And when Mike Shinoda starts singing, \"take me down to the river bend, take me down to the fighting end,\" you know that this is going to be a magical song which isn't your typical Linkin Park. The chorus is short, poetic, and catchy. When I listen to the song, for some reason I think of Stephen King's The Dark Tower series. It also is reminiscent of Mumford & Sons and Johnny Cash. This is the song that I would play to people who are skeptical about the album.\nRATING 14\/10 :-P\n\nONE WORD SUMMARY: TRANSCENDENT\n\nREMINISCENT OF: Nothing they've done before.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"One of Stripped's best and most mature tracks, the haunting ballad Walk Away agonizes over a deceitful lover who seemed too good to be true and showed his true colors once Christina was in his grasp.

{"text":"If there is one thing that can be said about Tift Merritt, it's that she has never made a bad album. Starting with her 2002 debut \"Bramble Rose\", her body of work has been nothing short of consistent. She has garnered widespread critical acclaim- even if the promotion was lacking. She seemed to be destined for stardom with her sophomore album \"Tambourine\" getting a Grammy nomination and the first single \"Good Hearted Man\" receiving a little airplay on Country Music Television. Unfortunately, her then label Lost Highway Records dropped the ball, which caused her to defect to the recently reactivated Fantasy Records for the release of the 2008 concept album \"Another Country\".\n\nGeorge Drakoulias- who produced \"Tambourine\" and the criminally overlooked \"Another Country\"- has been replaced by indie-rock producer Tucker Martine (Spoon, The Decemberists, Surfjan Stevens), who builds on the sound that Drakoulias crafted for her on her previous efforts. Tift, much like her fellow alt-country peer Shelby Lynne, walks the fine line between country and R&B on the songs \"Papercut\" and the lead off track \"Mixtape\". Jim James of My Morning Jacket provides background vocals on the ballad \"Feel Of The World\". The songs \"The Things That Everybody Does\", \"Never Talk About It\" and the title track \"See You On The Moon\" have a largely acoustic backing. She tackles a couple of covers, such as Emitt Rhodes' \"Live Till You Die\" and her slightly different take on the Loggins & Messina classic \"Danny's Song\". The album ends with the somber piano driven ballad \"After Today\". In short, \"See You On The Moon\" is another wonderful addition to Tift's catalog and hopefully, she will get that long overdue recognition.","classification":5,"fold":4}

I've been yearning for it for years...I purchased it the instant I was notified!.\nOverall the project is well written,arranged and produced,it's just like a zepher,a cool eveling wind. Without a doubt, this is MAJOR HARRIS greatest effort!.The songs here has truly stand the rugged test of time itself and are as new as if released yesterday!!!.\nThis soothing effort starts with the light,bouncy yet regretful \"EACH MORNING I WAKE UP\". The ultimate song here,my most favorite, is the steamy, highly erotic and most sensual \"LOVE WONT LET ME WAIT\"!!!.The yearning, the pleading, the desperation,and the reaction is as real as it can ever be. The orgasmic moans\/screams by BARBARA INGRAM is as vivid as ever!!!. She is literally writhing\/ranting in heat\/ecstasy, nothing is left to imagine. This is surely one of the greatest lovemaking songs ever recorded!!!.\nNext is the airy \"SWEET TOMORROW\" and the most sad \"SIDESHOW\",originally done by the soul group BLUE MAGIC. \"TWO WRONGS\" bouncy yet regretful. Next is the hopeful \"LOVING YOU IS MELLOW\" a favorite. \"JUST A THING I DO\" is poetry in motion, I love this work of art as well. \"AFTER LOVING YOU\" is an expression of long lost love, lively yet a tad sad. Concluding this supreme effort is his remake of the classic \"MY WAY\", with his soothing tenor voice, he makes this song his very own. I recommend this one-of-a-kind record to all fans of true soul music...A dose of life itself...You will agree as you listen...A most worthy addition to your private stock...A true treasure indeed...","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Prism is much better than Teenage Dream. But the whole album is still NOT for children. There are several songs that are not for children the main one is \"Birthday\" DO NOT buy this or let your children listen to this! There are some songs that are okay for children but NOT the whole album and definietly NOT the song caleld \"Birthday\" so if you hear your children listening to this stop it immediately, also do not let them listen to Teenage Dream almost ANY song other than Firework is very sexually explicit! The title track Teenage Dream, California Dreams, ET, Peacock, Last Friday Night are ALL sexually explicit and NO children should listen to those, if you let your children listen to those you are a horrible parent.\n\nNow as for this album there is at least WAY WAY less sexuality...the only major sexual song is Birthday and the lyrics in the other songs are much better, but the major problem with this one is another problem Teenage Dream album had is that it forces way too much high pitched vocals that don't sound good because there's just way too many high pitched vocals in that song...luckily not all songs like are like that...but even the more decent songs are just completely generic and suffer from poor vocals...they're just not AS bad as the others but still not worth listening to. A lot of these songs are clearly influenced by if not directly copying many other songs so the originality is not there, even Roar is highly similar to several other songs including Eye of The Tiger by Survivor, plus the song This Moment copies what made Trapped in The Closet by R. Kelly famous there is no way that similarity was done on accident. Lack of originalty and too many repetitive bad sounding high pitched vocals ruin the majority of the album. Some bad lyrics. Cannot recommend the album has a whole despite the album not being all bad there are some decent [VERY generic] tracks but still not really worth listening to because there is WAY better music out there. This album and the artist themselves is FAKE. This artist never would have had a hit song if it weren't for buying her own radio airtime [confirmed by radio stations] and buying Youtube views [also confirmed by Youtube and VEVO] what ultimately makes these songs just horrible is just the fact of how horrible of a person Katy Perry is. She is a lying, cheating, and backstabbing person who doesn't belong in the music industry. She never would have ever charted if she didn't cheat to chart.","classification":1,"fold":4}

{"text":"Imagine Dragons appear to be the 'it' band of the moment. Time will tell whether they go on to be classics like U2 or Coldplay, because that's the direction I hear them taking. Of course there's always the comparison to Train, The Killers, and I'm sure there's others out there. So, why this band? They seemingly came out of nowhere with their debut \"Night Visions\" in 2012. They hadn't even been working the circuit for that long, maybe four years?\n\nWell, I give the band props, because three members came from the Berklee School of Music in Boston. You can hear their training in the master craftsmanship of their music. Bruce Hornsby (who is a God) also came from the Berklee School of Music, and I think the excellent Paula Cole also came from there as well as many other I'm sure.\n\nSo, how is the sophomore album compared with the band's debut? Good, but I think I still like their first album more. I think it had more bang for your buck in terms of irresistible hooks. That's not to say that \"Smoke + Mirrors\" is weak or bad. It's not, it just doesn't have as many great songs on it. For me, my top picks would be \"Shots\", \"Gold\", \"I Bet My Life\", \"Polaroid\", \"Trouble\" and \"The Fall\". The rest of the tracks are decent, and in particular, the rockier \"I'm So Sorry\" and \"Friction\" showcase the band in a slightly different light.\n\nThe problem for me is that I am older than the band members by about a decade, and so I have heard many bands like Imagine Dragons over the years, and I think they still have some work to do in differentiating themselves from the rest of the pack. They have big shoes to fill if they want to be U2 (which, to me, is the root of their sound whether they want to admit it or not), plus Coldplay (who also borrowed from U2).\n\nI've read that their are more 'world music' influences on this album. Well, again, I've heard it all. This isn't Paul Simon's \"Graceland\", and the band should check out Johnny Clegg & Juluka and Johnny Clegg and Savuka. I was reminded of them somewhat in places on \"Smoke + Mirrors\". But still, this is nowhere near a 'world music' album or vibe. There are a few places here and there on the album, but overall, it remains an alternative rock album in my book. I should also name drop Peter Gabriel, Talking Heads and Robbie Robertson as 'world music' champions. Like I said, big shoes to fill.\n\nImagine Dragons show skill and dexterity, and some lyrical chops. In other words, they show promise. I look forward to future releases. Side note: U2's second album 1981's \"October\" is my least favorite, so taking that into consideration, Imagine Dragons have plenty of room to grow and mature before they get to their \"The Joshua Tree\" or \"Achtung Baby\" or their \"Sgt. Pepper's\".\n\nHere's how \"Smoke + Mirrors\" compares to \"Night Visions\":\n\n2012 Night Visions: Four Stars\n2015 Smoke + Mirrors: Three and a Half Stars","classification":4,"fold":4}

In the late 70's, it could have been a jazz fusion song.  Today, it could probably make it as a smooth jazz cut.  I remember it getting airplay on my local R&B station when it was new.

Look At The Grillz is cool even though TI and Twista outshined Ball & G on that track. Lloyd shows up on the dynamic Forever.  There are some songs that could have been left off. Trying To Get At You and Baby Girl are horrible attempts at songs for the ladies.  The Streets feat Bun B is boring. Shot Off with Ludacris sounds well... ludicrous.

{"text":"Have had this CD for less than 3 days, mind made up, best of this genre that I have heard this year.\n\nSome die-hard Chi fans are berating this effort because it doesn't duplicate the sounds of CTA-II-V-VII-VII (Guercio) or the 17-21 (Foster) sounds.  I knew that Scheff and Champlin had the makings of giving this band new life, given the right production and management.\n\nThis band has finally, (under Jay DeMarcus production) with XXX, come into their own. Of note, checking the Rascall Flatts website, DeMarcus profile shows that Chicago and David Foster were two of his major influences.  It shows on this production.\n\nThe STRONG voices of Lamm, Champlin and Scheff, with the addition of TOTO members Bobby Kimball and Joseph Williams, and the Rascal Flatts singers makes for as strong a vocal production they have done since Cetera's departure, breaking new ground for the band.  Instrumentally, the bands already strong skills are supplanted by  some of Nashville's best hired guns on guitar and drums.\n\nStylistically, they cover Trip-Hop-Pop, Power Ballads, Power Pop, New Country, Jazz Fusion, and Blues Rock.  This kind of diversity is unheard of in todays' music scene.\n\n\"Love Will Come Back\" with Rascal Flatts on vocals has the makings of a new country hit. Expect it to be the most added song to New Country playlists\n\n\"Caroline\" as the makings of a Power Pop anthem. Renegade rock stations stand the best chance of adding this to playlists.\n\n\"King of Might Have Been\" is another stand-out, Scheff power ballad.\n\n\"Feel\", the first single, has the best chance on the Adult Contemporary scene, with its updated beat and production values.\n\n\"90 Degrees and Freezing\" is a Lamm Jazz-Fusion piece which reminds you of the roots of the band back inthe 60's and early 70's. Maybe Jazz and Public stations will play this, too complex and tight for AAA, too hip and edgy for AC.\n\nOther material is very good, not just \"filler\" but it's doubtful any of it will ever get airplay.\n\nAll in all, a very pleasant surprise to critical listeners.  No corners were cut on this production, and Warner\/Rhino seems to be doing a good job at promoting it.  Just hope they can break them back into the spotlight.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Thi'sl doesn't disappoint with his fifth album the second full length in his Full Ride Music Group catalog.  If you're looking for that rundown, dead Trap music, look elsewhere.  This is Jesus music, God glorifying heart to heart music that you can bump anywhere.  Thi'sl goes for the heart of the least of these throughout his experience growing up in St. Louis, Missouri to his calling into full time ministry.  The production and lyrical value goes through the roof on this album. Don't get it twisted You're getting that authentic Thi'sl signature sound; only boasting of the cross of Christ, and proclaiming Jesus to the world.  From the title track \"Fallen King\" featuring the soul shaking vocals of Mars Ferrer, who is presently making great strides as a Gospel, R&B lyricist and vocalist. She sounds phenomenal.  My favorite tracks are \"Keep Grinding\", \"Take My LIfe\" which reunites fellow St. Louis brothers in Christ, and youth leaders,  Json and Flame,  Lyrically smashing the track each declaring that the gospel of Jesus Christ will still change lives even though we will have to face and suffer death. Reaffirming as believers in Jesus Christ we don't have to fear the enemy. The single \"King Without A Crown\"  featuring Corey Paul is a lava hot track.  Corey Paul goes in on his verse.  When this track is through you have the impression that no matter what we've accumulated in life, only Jesus is worthy of having all crowns placed at His feet.  \"Rooks featuring SPZRKT and \"No Make Up\"  are amazing tracks as well.  Thank you Thi'sl for looking fear in the face and for standing your ground, teaching us that only Jesus is worthy of all glory like the Word of God declares.  Full Ride is in the building!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Better than the overproduced \"Overexposed,\" \"V\" is Maroon 5's return to making candy-floss pop. I mean that as a compliment. As many bands that try to make this kind of music, few succeed at it quite the way Adam Levine and the boys do. Want more proof? Just think of Adam's TV stint on \"The Voice,\" where assorted contestants vie for the opportunity to make this kind of music (with the odd country or soul belter mixed in for variety) and remind yourself that the show has yet to turn out a viable star. If it was that easy, they'd all have sales of the magnitude Maroon 5 have achieved.\n\nFor one thing, Maroon 5 know their way around a killer hook. Both \"Maps\" and \"Animals\" have hooks so big they belong in butcher shops and Adam's blue eyed soul delivery (and falsetto) make them stick to your ear canals. He also knows how to deliver one for the ladies, as the ballad \"Unkiss Me\" shows. The big piano ballad with Gwen Stefani, \"My Heart Is Open\" is a wonderful pairing, although \"Moves Like Jagger\" wins the duet contest by virtue of its snappiness. Yet Maroon 5 provide the fizz that pop in the 10's needs to stand above the fray.\n\nI'll add an extra recommendation for the deluxe version of \"V\" in that two of the three songs are actually worthy of the couple extra bucks. There's the surprisingly bare bones version of the 90's one hit wonder Marcy Playground's \"Sex And Candy.\" Then theirs the Levine solo track \"Lost Stars,\" which Levine recorded for the movie \"Begin Again\" which Levine had an acting role in. They round out \"V\" and make it an album to rival Maroon 5's better entries.","classification":4,"fold":4}

I have since realized that Newman stands among the great social satirists - and that's everybody, not just the singer-songwriters. Whether it's pollution\/industrialization (Burn On), Religion (He Gives us All his love, God's Song), Death (Old Man), Fame (Lonely at the Top), Reminiscing (Dayton Ohio 1903, Last Night I had a Dream ), Perversion\/Lust (Leave Your Hat on), American Ignorance\/Racism (Sail Away) - Randy's craft is undeniably poinant, honest, and meticulous in it's disection of the human heart and our social practices.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"When I heard Yes was coming out with a new album I was excited and couldn't wait to get it. They are, in my opinion, one of the most influential rock bands of all time. But then I heard Jon Anderson, their vocalist for much of their career, would not be singing, and I was disappointed... Almost reluctant to listen. Though I was very skeptical at first, I'm so glad that I gave it shot. The band, consisting of Benoit David on vocals, along with Chris Squire (bass), Steve Howe (guitar), Alan White (drums) and Geoff Downes (keyboards) sounds amazing. The production is crisp and fresh, and, most importantly, the songs are awesome. \"Fly From Here\" gets things going and is a 5 part, more then 20 minute long song that includes \"Overture\" as well as \"Fly From Here\" parts I - V. This isn't really something Yes has done before: It has a darker, more atmospheric feel then typical Yes songs. The main chorus is phenomenal, and Steve Howe's playing will blow your mind! He shows his true nature as a virtuoso as he alternates between an astral slide guitar, a straight ahead attack, and the perfect blend of melody, Spanish-influenced guitars, and scorching solos. As is typical of his style, his playing enhances each and every song, adding dramatic textures and harmonies that only he is capable of. The result is a fresh sounding masterpiece that even long time, diehard fans of the band will love. \"The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be\" is a Squire-penned ballad with more amazing guitars and bass. And while he'll never be Jon Anderson, Benoit David's vocals are spot on and he can really deliver! \"Life on a Film Set\" starts off slow and mellow but gains energy and intensity; I was sucked in and couldn't help playing it over and over to catch every nuance. \"Into the Storm\" closes out the CD with a bang. It has some cool analog synth guitars in which Howe shows off his wide repertoire of licks and features some of the best multi layered vocal harmonies I've heard in a long time. From start to finish this is an incredible album that leaves you wanting more. I would highly recommend it to anyone!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Who would have ever thought Michael Jackson would die in this era?  It doesn't seem real, he wasn't supposed 2 die.  This collection of hits is almost as good as buying all of his solo works.  I actually would rather have each individual album but I don't have time for all that and I already own hundreds of cds, so The Essential Michael Jackson makes the most sense, for content and consolidation reasons.  But I still would like the artwork and other tracks from the other cds but I just don't feel like buying them, so i just bought this.  I went to 5 different stores and they were all SOLD OUT.  I finally got the last copy but I had to pay $25.  I think alot of people are just buying this cd as a trinket, I actually want to LISTEN to the music, so stop buying it if you are just going to hold it in your hand and stare at it and drool over it.  As for the music, I don't like any of the Jackson 5 stuff, it sounds dated and all the songs are overplayed.  I like \"Ben\", in my oppinion, that's the only good song MJ did when he was really young. They left out \"Never can Say Goodbye\" which is about the only good Jackson 5 song, so that sucked.  All MJ's other hits are on here from ALL the albums.  The only other song I'm pissed about is \"Jam\".  I wish they would have included that song, but I don't want to have to go out and find a copy of \"Dangerous\" just for that song.  Life is complicated and the music industry always makes it complicated for music fans. I wasn't really impressed with the pics in the liner notes, they could have included better, unreleased pics of Michael.  I am a Michael Jackson fan even though I disconnected with him and his music during the child molestation stuff.  Now that he died, I can feel better about paying him tribute and listening to his music again.  After all, I did a lip sync of \"Bad\" in full costume in high school drama class.  MJ was a part of my life.  God Bless u Michael, this world loved u.  *One last note....\"Farewell My Summer Love\" should have been included on this cd, that song is probably impossilble to find.

He retired in 1997 after some years at WCHL-1360, in Chapel Hill, NC.\n\nFounded in 1925 as a 5,000 watt station at the top of the AM dial, by 1960 WMCA adopted their successful \"Good Guys\" Top 40 format. Despite competition from 50,000 watt clear channel WABC-770, 'MCA was NYC's ratings champ from 1963 through '66. By 1970, they transitioned to an all talk format called \"Dial-Log Radio.\"\n\nNYC's PREMIER ALBUMS was founded in 1959 as a budget operation with such labels as CORONET and SPIN-O-RAMA. In 1965, Premier bought out Philly-based CAMEO\/PARKWAY. Their JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY - A MEMORIAL ALBUM (#2099) is fine-quality: a substantial disc with good audio.

Mansfield's comments were briefest, but also the most moving:\n\n\"There was a sound of laughter; in a moment, it\nwas no more. And so she took a ring from her finger\nand placed it in his hands.\nThere was a husband who asked much and gave much,\nand out of the giving and the asking wove with a\nwoman what could not be broken in life, and in a\nmoment it was no more. And so she took a ring from\nher finger and placed it in his hands, and kissed him\nand closed the lid of a coffin.\nA piece of each of us died at that moment.

I love how Lorde has her hair pulled back and that she sits still through most of the video -- that is, until she puffss up her neck and lip synchs to the word \"Yeah.\"  It's ironic but in a very good way.\n\nLorde is a budding, yet consummate artist to watch out for -- I'm still listening to the rest of the Pure Heroine album, so of course I will review it later on.  And let's hope for a follow-up album from her in 2015 or 2016!!  :)","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"A traditional German carol, it's fitting the first verse is presented in German.  The different languages used (German, Italian? and English) in this version of the carol attest to the international appeal of the song.  The voices of the group are very light and uplifting, and their range is incredible.  It's unusual to hear a soprano being able to maintain the fullness of her voice in the extreme upper ranges, but their voices never become strained or pinched.  The harmonies are simply lovely, and the orchestral accompaniment enhances the song and makes the music soar.  At times, it seems almost angelic.\n\nNote: I downloaded the song during a free promotion, but it made me interested in the album.  When I checked, it was disappointing to see this song was not included in the album, \"Home for Christmas.\"  I looked around, and did find it included as a bonus track on a different version the album.  So, if you want this song, be careful to ensure you are selecting the version of the album that includes the bonus song prior to making your purchase.  Merry Christmas!","classification":5,"fold":4}

If you bought complete recordings of every composition excerpted on this disc, you might have to file for bankruptcy, so don't let purism stand in the way of enjoying Mozart.\n\nI used this set as my introduction (it was previously packaged as THE GREATEST MOZART SHOW ON EARTH) when I first ventured into classical music a couple of years ago, and so far I've expanded into operas, piano concertos, violin concertos, and string quintets.\n\nThe genius revealed over the range of forms led to love at first listening!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"In 1977, Peabo Bryson signed with Capitol Records and these two fine albums let the world know that he was one of the best new balladeers and that he would have an eventful career as a solo artist ahead of him. At a time when Disco and hard Funk ruled the radio airwaves, Peabo recorded these two ballad-filled albums and ended up a real winner with two best-selling (both were certified Gold!) albums to his credit. Classic hits like \"I'm So Into You\", \"Feel The Fire\", \"Reaching For The Sky\" and \"She's A Woman\" all became staples of Quiet Storm radio shows and sound just as ageless today as they did back in 1978. Amazingly, this is the first time ever that these albums are made available on CD anywhere in the world and we must thank David Nathan and Soulmusic.com Records for reissuing them. If you are a fan of classic, emotive and soul-stirring vocals, you should waste no time in getting this 2-CD set. Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"\"Miss Thang\" is still standing after 15 years in this business we call show. Monica, the gorgeous sista from 'Collipark\",GA (ATL suburb)always had the chops. Even with three stars, this effort gets a mixed review from me. I love her voice more than her material. Her talent metrics better production and live instrumentation with an old school presentation (example: Anita Baker).  Monica needs to take a trip outta the 'hood. Just get out of the 'hood! Leave it, let it go and just fly up to NY or Philly to record for the next CD. She has yet to make a CD that defines her. I hear hints of greatness. But, she continues to listen to sham 'hood producers who are stuck with safe radio friendly doo doo. Lucky for her, Atlanta loves her. V-103 FM Radio (ATL) is really giving her the big push as they have done in the past. Her single, \"Everything To Me\" is the best song on this product. It rips the vocal and music arrangement of Deneice Williams' '80s classic, \"Silly\" with new contemporary lyrics. Nice rip. I wish she did a few more songs like that.\nInstead,  autotune usage and canned backing mar most of the other tracks.\n\"Mirror\" is the other stand out track. It sounds like a track Jazmine Sullivan might have done. See, yet again Monica sounds like somebody else. Bottomline, I wanna hear Monica.","classification":3,"fold":4}

There is the gradual build of intensity, both musically and vocally, the quiet introspective line reading in the middle and at the end of each song and the songs stick to the themes of love, loss and the emotional responses to each. The newness and discovery is gone and there is an element of going through the motions here that I am not surprised the band decided to go in a different direction with their next release. Its still very listenable, but almost indistinguishable from their first album.","classification":3,"fold":4}

Since it was written after Jack Bruce went to a Jimi Hendrix concert and worked on some chords he heard I don't know where to fully give the credit. However, Eric Clapton is no slouch of a musician and wrote many great songs after Hendrix was in the great beyond, so I will give Clapton the benefit of the doubt.

{"text":"\"Smooth\" is a very fun and great pop\/rock song done beautifully by Carlos Santana.  I remember being in my senior year in high school when I heard this song. When I saw the video to this song being played on one of the music channels there was something about it that drew me on(I just wish that I can remember if it was VH1 or MTV). Carlos made the right decision when he selected Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty to sing the vocals (Rob has a great singing voice). The reason why I say this is because I noticed that in the music video Rob Thomas really put his spirit and emotion in giving the musical \"Smooth\" a vibrant life of its own. \"Smooth\" is a gorgeous song about a man who is willing to change his life to accomodate the woman he loves, and he is asking the woman in his life to make up her mind about him. He makes this clear with the clever and catchy lyrics \"so give me your heart, make it real, or else forget about it). I love and enjoy listening to Rob Thomas's vocals in this song. In addition, I was imagining who this song was for, especially when Rob Thomas did a good job of using his voice of emphasizing the lyrics \"my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa\" When I found out later on that it was for his wife Marisol Thomas I was very moved and thought that was romantic and heartwarming. I say this because \"Smooth\" came out in 1999. It is posted online that they met in 1998 and married in 1999. At the time of this writing, they are still married (which I think is so beautiful by the way, may they enjoy more joyful and loving years together). I admit that part of the reason why I still find this song enjoyable to listen to is because I enjoy hearing Rob Thomas's singing (Rob's music and vocals first drew me in with the 1997 Matchbox 20 musical hit \"Push\"). The best way to choose whether you are going to love this song is if you enjoy music by either Rob Thomas, Carlos Santana, and\/or romantic alternative rock songs.","classification":5,"fold":4}

The people that bought the song has made a ton of money, but the band got the shaft. I also heard that the band tried to form under another name, but never did manage to make another killer song like Train Train because, well, honestly, they couldn't get over the fact that they practically GAVE several million dollars worth of royalties away.

Yes, and more so. The Hounds present a less pop oriented country music offering than the Dixie Chicks but they are ever more grounded in a well played and smooth folk\/country. This is a record that should be heard.

The musicians who wrote the song, Eric Clapton and George Harrison are legends in their own right apart from Cream.  It was written for Cream's farewell album \"Goodbye.\"  The concept was that each band member would write a song and this was Eric Clapton's song. Apparently, Clapton enlisted George Harrison to help him complete it but however Badge came down the pike it remains an important part of Rock N Roll history and deserves a place in any comprehensive collection.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Toni Toni Tone were a band that impressed me from the moment I heard them. As someone generally always attracted to well produced and engineered live funk,soul,pop and rock groups? Upon first seeing the band perform on SNL in 1993 really peaked my interest to seek out the rest of their sadly all too brief recorded catalog. Their albums were always floating around. And never difficult to get a hold of. But only last year did I round out my collection with their first two albums. This is their second release,from 1990. By that time? Hip-hop derived music,especially mixed with soul\/R&B were the mainstream. And again? Toni had their own way of swimming with the musical tide.\n\n  \"Feels Good\" opens the album with a vocal harmony drenched,percussive funk\/house with samples of female breathing and jazzy vocalese in the back round. \"All The Way\" is a JB style digitized new jack funk number led by an electronic slide whistle. \"The Blues\" and \"Let's Have a Good Time\" follow a similar lead. \"Oakland Stroke\" is a rap oriented hip-hop funk tribute featuring vocal help from Vanessa Williams as well as horn samples from Kool & The Gang. \"Sky's The Limit\",\"Don't Talk About Me\" and \"Skin Tight\" are more straight up new jack dance music. The ballads \"It Never Rains (In Southern California)\",\"I Care\" and \"Whatever You Want\" are expansive urban contemporary slow jams.\n\n  \"Jo-Jo\" is pounding mid 80's style dance\/funk while \"Those Were The days\" is an early 90's re-write of Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" both musically and lyrically-this time lamenting the violence and paranoia of contemporary urban life over the freedom of bygone days specifically. This album is one of the best realized album from the peak of the new jack era that I've ever heard. The rhythmic and melodic pallet of the album is powerful and diverse. From hard funk,contemporary soul ballads,new jack dance music to hip-hop type numbers. All with that special flavor Toni Toni Tone provided. I love it!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"\"Don't Even Try\" is one of the many lackluster tracks on this album, but it really should be the title. I've been a lifelong Bryan Adams fan and enjoyed his work up till 2008. But this album is, by far, his worst effort. The song-writing is atrocious. He simply has nothing to say. Not even remotely interesting melodies. It seems each song tries to emulate a band he liked growing up (Thunderbolt attempts a an AC\/DC imitation, but most of it is very weak Elvis, early Byrds inspired).\n\nThe only listenable track is \"Yesterday was just a dream.\" But the outtakes from Reckless were all far better than anything that can be found on this album. I usually am very happy to see artists whose heyday was in the 80s and 90s still producing new music, but this album seems to show that Bryan Adams simply has no creative instincts left and can't write a decent pop\/rock song anymore. I suspect that most long-time BA fans will be very disappointed. The album barely goes beyond 30 minutes in length because BA just couldn't write any worthwhile content.","classification":1,"fold":4}

{"text":"For those not familiar with the self-titled debut release, band founder Matt Smith composed all of the songs and performed all of the instruments (sans acoustic drums). Despite this deficiency the album was so well received that it became an instant classic and quickly went out of print. Fast forward to 2013, Theocracy has grown from 1 member to 5, released two stellar albums on Ulterium and the demand for a reissue\/rerecording of the debut became a reality. As Smith points out in the updated liner notes the only thing new is a re mastering of the original recording with Shawn Bensons acoustic drums replacing the programmed drum sounds. These songs were already extremely good but now sound all that much more credible and powerful with a real timekeeper at the helm. Bensons style is well suited to the majority of this speedy power metal. And while he has clearly expanded upon the basic drum tracking, he has done so in a manner as to not disrupt the original flow of the music. Reissues rarely add much to the original  especially when the original was near perfect  but in this case these songs can now be heard the way they were originally meant to be recorded, transforming a classic of epic Christ-centric power metal into a masterpiece.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Ever since Snoop Doog debuted in 1992, he was destined to become the Robin to Dr. Dre's Batman. It became clear to everyone that the partnership was meant to be- as Snoop was the only rapper on \"The Chronic\" who appeared on no less than ten songs. As expected Dr. Dre would return the favor by producing Snoop's highly anticipated debut \"Doggystyle\". Unfortunately, that pairing would be short-lived- as Dr. Dre would leave Death Row Records over creative differences with the company's CEO Marion \"Suge\" Knight. Due to Dre's absence, he turned to DJ Pooh to produce the lion's share of his sophomore effort \"Tha Doggfather\". Although Snoop repeatedly claimed allegiance to Death Row, by the end of the decade, he surprised everyone by leaving the label. Even more shocking was his signing to Master P's No Limit Records, where he seemed like a fish out of water. His debut for the label \"Da Game Is To Be Sold, Not To Be Told\" only made things more complicated, as he sought out production from the label's in-house collective Beats By The Pound. He reunited with Dr. Dre on two more albums under No Limit- 1999's \"No Limit Top Dogg\" and \"Tha Last Meal\"- which put him back in the spotlight. In 2002, he released \"Paid Tha Cost To Be Da Boss\"- an album that yielded two hits produced by The Neptunes: \"From Tha Chuuuch To Tha Palace\" and \"Beautiful\". The collaboration proved to be fruitful for his next few projects, but they have never done an entire album together- at least until now.\n\nWith Pharrell Williams as executive producer and producing the entire album with assistance from Chad Hugo, Snoop released his new album \"Bush\". Musically, the album sounds like a tribute to mid 80's electro funk- something that he's no stranger to (See: \"Sensual Seduction\" and the Dam-Funk collaboration \"7 Days Of Funk\"). Despite the fact that he's barely rapping, \"Bush\" is an interesting listen. He starts off the album with the  hometown tribute \"California Roll\", which marks the second time that Snoop works with legendary singer Stevie Wonder. On \"This City\", he wants to take someone on a fun night on the town. He ponders about a woman's uninhibited side on \"R U A Freak\", while surrounding himself with lovely ladies on \"So Many Pros\". He gets help from Charlie Wilson on the first single \"Peaches N Cream\", which also has songwriting assistance from Nelly. T.I. guests on the sensual \"Edibles\", while he duets with No Doubt frontwoman Gwen Stefani on the dance track about forgetting their troubles \"Run Away\". Lastly, he closes out the album with the Kendrick Lamar and Rick Ross featured \"I'm Ya Dogg\". \"Bush\" is a surprisingly good album from Snoop Dogg. His mood has always been about wanting to be laid back and having fun and if nothing else, this album stays true to his personality. Although it would have been nice to hear him rapping a little more.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Brandy's last album, Afrodisiac--while not a commercial success--was a masterpiece in my eyes. Her voice was full of pure soul and grit that only comes from heartbreak and the dark Timbaland productions were a perfect canvas for the woman's chilling, eerie, and euphoric harmonies. Not only was it one of the best albums of the year, but it remains on my list of favorite R&B albums of all time. Foolishly, I expected Human to be a catastrophic release that rivaled her previous effort. It could never compare. It is not a bad album by any means, but it's a generally simple album. It is clear that Brandy has decided to veer in the more \"pop\" direction after her \"urban\" album did not fare well on Billboard. This creates some great songs, but the album tends to get a bit formulaic at times; I can only handle so many overly joyous synth-pop songs with a suffocating amount of layers (\"The Definition,\" \"Warm It Up (With Love),\" etc.) Quite a few of the songs simply sound the same, frankly. \"Human\" is a clich&eacute; \"I'm-just-like-you\" type of song that should've been left off and replaced in favor of better songs that were irresponsibly left off of this set (\"After the Flood,\" among others) and \"Long Distance\" feels like the writers were just trying too hard to write a universal super-hit. Still, Human has plenty of satisfying songs, including the grand first single, \"Right Here (Departed).\" \"Shattered Heart\" is a beautifully ominous track with a gentle broken-hearted chorus. \"True\" is a breath of relief from some of the overly complicated material here: a simple and genuine ballad saturated with heartbreak. \"A Capella (Something's Missing)\" is the song I've always wanted Brandy to record. Her harmonies are pretty much unrivaled by anyone in the R&B industry and I'm glad they are shown in their naked form. Co-written by Brandy and Natasha Bedingfield, \"Fall\" is a dramatic, piano-laden mid-tempo full of energy. The best track here, though, is the sweet \"1st and Love\" with its stomping and waling chorus. While this is not the album I was expecting--and it does have several weak moments of overly glossy pop--it is still a nice album from Brandy.","classification":3,"fold":4}

But when it has came down to his last studio album was here was alive, Invincible, it has been a bit more lagged than strong when it has came down to great songs. While it did have some good songs like You Rock My World, Butterflies and Cry, others just simply couldn't drive in the heart. Break Of Dawn, showed more of a dance and R&B rhythm from what Michael had shown in his other songs. The song honestly wasn't a strong one, but showed his vocals maturely. Sadly, though I didn't feel it was one of his stronger songs in R&B, the way he had it with Bad and Thriller. It really wasn't his best effort, but a good song after time has gone by. If you are a massive Michael Jackson fan, get Invincible as a album.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":4}

If you're a McGraw fan, you will like this one. If you're not, you just might like it anyway.

{"text":"Talk Talk Talk is the Furs at the height of their game, exhilarating and dense, with one riveting piece of candy-coated trash after another floating out of the speakers. In my own punk heydey, this was killer choice stuff -- even though it's not really punk at all -- and came at a time when doctrinal rigidity to crud like hardcore or straightcore or whatever didn't mean diddly. Talk Talk Talk came out at a time before radio had completed its terrible march to niche segregation, and exciting music was coming at kids from all corners. Punk and new wave stuff led the blast. The Furs were among the best and most disposable at the same time. One quibble with the Amazon reviewer: He takes a crack at what followed this from the Furs, but Forever Now is a very good record that, with the devastating Brechtian nightmare of \"Easy Street\" and sweet metalic joy of \"Yes I Do\" and when they went all mushy on us (\"Heaven,\" \"The Ghost In You\") it was still irresistable. Last great one for me: \"Until She Comes.\"","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"As a huge fan of all three of these singer\/songwriters, I've waited impatiently for this CD to be released.  I kind of knew what to expect because two songs were made available for download in advance, and I fell in love with both of them, together with the ethereal blend of these great voices. Somehow these three very different voices and singing styles mesh smoothly; they're like a female Crosby Stills & Nash, only more spaced out.  Each singer has solo songs with the other two on harmony\/background vocals.  Back when I first discovered Veirs, around 2004, she was an acquired taste, taking a couple of CDs to really warm up to, but once I got used to her little girl, vibratoless voice and deadpan delivery it got so I had to have all of her recordings. Her poetry is often quite beautiful.  I won't single too much out here, because this is an excellent outing, start to finish. \"Honey and Smoke\" is a lovely arrangement, instruments weaving in and out of the three voices, lang taking the lead. It's a good indicator of the direction the rest of the CD goes:  melodic folk-rock with a gently rhythmic pop sheen.  Another highlight is the appropriately titled \"Delerium,\" which Case rocks home. Like this song, many of the others have a gorgeously nostalgic 60s flavor.  I was especially touched by the sweet tribute, \"Song for Judee,\" obviously about the late, great Judee Sill, this time the lead taken by Veirs. Case shines in all of her solo moments, particularly the opener, \"Atomic Number,\" and the almost psychedelic \"Supermoon.\"  Within this melodic atmosphere, there's some variety on offer, with a couple of songs decidedly folky, like \"Greens of June,\" which reminded me of early Simon & Garfunkel, and others, like \"Best Kept Secret,\" going in a more rock direction, Veirs reminding me of Wendy Waldman and Edie Brickell combined.  I thoroughly enjoy this CD; I think it actually rivals the wonderful Trio (Harris\/Parton\/Ronstadt) collaborations. I hope this group does a follow up soon!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Brandi Carlile blends a mix of new and old in The Firewatchers Daughter.  New  the album contains a collection of 12 eclectic songs that completely show Carlile and Phil and Tim Hanseroths unadultered musicianship and production that listeners have come accustomed to hear.  And for this album, it sounds like the band did a good job to capture the intimacy of playing together.\n\nThe Firewatchers Daughter was produced on the ATCO Records label, a departure from the bands four previous albums, which were carried on the Columbia Records.  In spite of that noticeable change, the music speaks for itself.  In a world of music that possess somewhat overproduced songs, the band remains true to their roots and this album clearly shows the raw and powerful instrumentation and unique vocal style of all three members of the band, guitar, bass, vocals, hand claps, and percussions.  As one listens to each song, Carlile and company may have picked up where they left on Give Up the Ghost with the track Dying Day.  A few of the songs have that style of Americana and more.  From the opening track Wherever is Your Heart, to the proceeding ones, the extremely most rock-driven and kick the dirt type of song on the record Mainstream Kid, two rockers the cowbell makes an appearance on Blood Muscle Skin Bone and Alibi hearken to sixties-garage pop that may have showed up on the Nuggets collection.  Aside those elements of the album, there are the touching and heartfelt songs that play with immense maturity than previously heard on her first two studio albums.  One may hear a bit of regret and bitterness in the lyrics, but for songs such as The Eye, Beginning to Feel the Years, and especially Heroes and Songs show she has closed a chapter of the past with so-called skeletons in maybe her closet.\n\nAnd after listening to all of the songs and reading the liner notes of the album, one can say that the band has a knack of producing down-home sounds that is all in the music and the family.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"When I first heard Ratt was releasing a new record in April, I had very low hopes for it. Their last effort, while not awful, certainly wasn't up to par with Out Of The Cellar or Detonator. I will be the first to say, man was I wrong. This album kicks ass from start to finish!\n\nThe opener, Eat Me Up Alive, is monster rock song and starts the record off with a bang. Best Of Me is quite possibly the best Ratt song ever, catchy and melodic, I can't see how you could listen to this song and not get it stuck in your head. Lost Weekend, Look Out Below, As Good As It Gets, and Take A Big Bite are all great and keep the record flowing nicely.\n\nIf you are a fan of late 80's or early 90's hard rock, you should most definitly check this out, you won't be disappointed. Ratt did a hell of a job with this record, it sounds like it should have been released in 1992, right after Detonator, instead of taking 20 years to be released.\n\nOne other note, the band is not all the original line-up. Juan Crocier, who played bass, has chosen not to be part of Ratt any longer, and Robin Crosby passed away several years ago(RIP). The band is as follows.....\n\nStephen Pearcy - Vocals\nWarren DeMartini - Guitars\nCarlos Cavazo - Guitars (the dude from Quiet Riot, and a hell of an addition)\nRobbie Crane - Bass\nBobby Blotzer - Drums","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Dido had stated that her fourth album \"Girl Who Got Away\" would be more electronic and I had visions of her collaborations with Faithless, or even her clubby contribution \"Everything To Lose\" to the \"Sex And The City 2\" soundtrack.\n\nAlas, we get more of the same stuff which took up much of her \"Life For Rent\" or \"Safe Trip Home\" albums. That is great if you loved those albums. The arrangements are largely safe and she still sounds bland and listless for the most part. \"No Freedom\" and the first third of the album perfectly exemplify this.\n\nThe title track is a dull ballad garnished with electronic flourishes, while \"Let Us Move On\" features rapper Kendrick Lamar and while mildly pleasant, \"Stan\" it ain't.\n\n\"Blackbird\" threatens to break out into full synths and break beats. Starting with \"End Of Night\" (with pulsing synths and stomping beats) the album gets more interesting. In fact, this song is reminiscent of Pet Shop Boys. \"Love To Blame\" is another synth-driven song with Jazzy horns darting in the background and nice drum rolls and bells. \"Go Dreaming\" is a dreamy synth number.\n\nNext come a trio of lovely atmospheric ballads; The acoustic \"Happy New Year\", \"Loveless Hearts\" (with skittery beats), and the spare spectacular \"Day Before We Went To War\". Now if only the first third of the album matched the rest, this would be a real winner.","classification":3,"fold":4}

Unfortunately, for Celine Dion, she has been hit with so much sadness in her personal life from two devastating passings n her beloved heart.

Another one is the heartbreaking news that her soulmate and manager Rene' Angeil died after a severe battle of throat cancer that hurt their love and tore them apart. He battled in 1999 and survived, but it came back to take him for several years. When I think of Celine's sadness, I think of her song My Heart Will Go On from Titanic. It is one of those songs that really do strike you at the soul of the heart, and even more with the recent death of James Horner, and the hypnotic song that really grabbed you. Celine's heart will go on, but the heartstrings of her loves will always be in that song. That their souls will go on.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Ever since the early days of MTV, I started falling in love with Cyndi Lauper's music.  She was NOT like any other artist out there.  She was wacky, creative, quirky, fashionable (check out her various outfits) and didn't take herself so seriously.  And that New Yawk accent!!!  Quite simply, Cyndi just wanted to have fun.  But before she became a megastar on the pop map, she had previously fronted a rock band called Blue Angel.  They put out their first and ONLY record in 1980.  It really IS worth checking out.\n\nOnce Cyndi became an actual solo artist, her first order of business (aside from being on MTV) was to recruit another band called The Hooters.  They helped her launch 5 mega smashes on her 1983 debut, \"She's So Unusual.\"  First, there is the opener, \"Money Changes Everything.\"  Cyndi showed the world who was boss and that she wasn't going anywhere.  Next was the most important staple, \"Girls Just Want To Have Fun.\"  The whole indescribable nature of the song was what got her noticed in the first place (most notably on Dick Clark's American Bandstand).  Then there was the much more serious ballad \"Time After Time\", which remains one of my personal favorites to this day.  This album was only the tip of the iceberg of what would catapult Cyndi's 30 year career longevity.\n\nIn 1985, she released 2 tracks for The Goonies movie:  the theme song (\"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough\") and the much faster rocker, \"What A Thrill.\"  A year later, Cyndi spread out her artistic talent even further with \"True Colors.\"  Each song was a hit on its own, and Cyndi had A LOT of guest stars (The Bangles, Billy Joel, Aimee Mann, and even Pee Wee Herman).  The title track and accompanying video is another one of my personal faves.\n\nIn 1988, another minor hit:  \"Hole In My Heart (All The Way To China)\" from the movie Vibes.  It's a VERY elusive song to find, if that is even possible.  I actually got it from an 80's compilation disc on eBay several years ago.  It's just one of those feel good songs that you really need to have!!!\n\nNext came 1989's \"A Night To Remember\".  Cyndi was becoming much more serious as a songwriter and performer.  \"I Drove All Night\" had a much more rock feel to it, and it proved that Cyndi was indeed evolving.  Sadly, this was the only real hit on her record; in hindsight, the rest of the songs deserved MUCH more appreciation and should not have been cast aside.  What about \"Unconditional Love\" or \"Heading West\"??\n\nIn the 90's, Cyndi would release 3 more records.  By that time, she was getting even deeper into her artistry and would even release some non-album tracks.  For example, you may be familiar with the ethereal 1992's \"The World Is Stone.\"  In 1993, Cyndi re-teamed with the Hooters for some delicious tracks on \"Hat Full Of Stars.\"  There were, again, some minor hits:  \"That's What I Think\", \"Who Let In The Rain?\", and the lilting, hushed title track which is still another of my personal faves.  Unfortunately, the album wasn't getting the right amount of airplay.  But that never stopped Cyndi at all.  She kept having great song after song.\n\nIn 1995, Cyndi released her first greatest hits record, \"Twelve Deadly Cyns.\"  I loved the candy coated, luscious album cover, and so 3 new songs were added to Cyndi's ever growing repertoire:  \"I'm Gonna Be Strong\" (this was an updated version of the 1980 Blue Angel track), \"(Hey Now) Girls Just Want To Have Fun\" (a sequel to the 1983 megasmash), and \"Come On Home.\"\n\nBy 1996, this was when Cyndi was at her peak and had started to re-invent herself.  She wanted to be an ARTIST, not a \"hits\" maker.  On \"Sisters Of Avalon\", Cyndi went all over the map (but in a very good way, mind you).  There's the forceful, in your face title track.  2 other minor hits also took notice:  \"Ballad Of Cleo & Joe\" and \"Unhook The Stars.\"  Sadly, this particular album was one of her most underappreciated.\n\nOverall, this \"greatest hits\" CD covers Cyndi Lauper's timespan from 1983 to 1996.  Since then, Cyndi would release 6 more albums in 1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2008 and 2010.  No two records were EVER the same.  And that brings me to the 3 reasons that Cyndi is MY favorite female artist of all time.  One:  She created albums on her OWN terms and wouldn't conform to the record companies.  Two:  She played various instruments -- whatever she could find, she would put to use!  And three:  many of the songs were very euphoric and would make a person feel good about himself\/herself.\n\nSo, if anyone is having a bad day, all you need to do is put on a Cyndi Lauper record and learn how to have fun.  I'm sure glad that I did!!!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Heartfelt, passionate, strong, and beautiful!  This music speaks to the heart like a lover speaks to their beloved.  From the opening track beginning with the cello and violins, the mood is passionate and longing, but then it changes over to powerful rhythm of drums and a male and female choir with a dramatic theme like a mighty army coming closer to its target.  Then, the music and the voices abruptly stop and you hear the echoes die in the spaciousness of what I picture as vaulted ceilings.  This music could well be used for a battle scene with intermittent cut scenes going back and forth with the main character remembering the person that he left behind.  This is the first soundtrack that I have bought from Audiomachine, and it will probably not be my last.  They know what they are doing, and they have truly produced some epic music on this album.  Some of the composers that Paul Dinletir and Kevin Rix like are Mozart, Beethoven, Debussy, Hans Zimmer, and Harry Gragson-Williams which are composers I like as well.  One of the elements that I think makes music great is the phrasing of the themes that the composer comes up with and the variations of the themes that they make after they have stated the main theme.  Another element that I believe makes music great is not just the notes, but the silence between the notes.  Claude Debussy stated, \"Music is the silence between the notes,\" and J. Krishnamurti stated, \"Listen both to the sound of the bell and to the silence between it's strokes.\"  I like the phrasing that the composers have used of silence in their music, and they have created some great music.  As a case in point, take Track 2 with the beginning string's and the two-beat base, and they then add the theme with a female voice that hauntingly goes above this background rhythm like a crow flying over a desolate forest and landscape.  To strengthen the theme, the composers then use trumpets and horns to bring the theme more power and strength.  Then, unlike the first track, the composers do not go completely silent, but have about 4 measures with only the two-beat base going.  After that break, the music comes back with a heroic feeling of determination, like an army fighting against powerful odds.  I love piano music, and to me, it is like a violin, bringing out feelings of love and tenderness.  Track 3 starts out with just the piano playing a theme that denotes sadness, like someone may have just died, but soon it is joined by base, cello, and drums.  After this, a female voice begins the lament; powerful drums with a driving beat then pick up the pace.  Then, the musical journey begins over mountains, fording rivers, through dark valleys to reach the end of their quest for peace and some kind of meaning out of the sorrows of life.  I will not go through each track for music is meant to be listened to and felt, more than described and analyzed.  Each tack is wonderful to listen to, and it transports you wherever you let your imagination go.  Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I will admit, I am kinda, sorta hooked...okay, borderline obsessed with this album. I've been playing it non-stop for months. Two reviewers below, hit it right on the money. Absolutely buy the Deluxe version, the extra songs not on the American release are worth the extra money. And Take Me Home blows Adele's Hello out of the ballpark. The passionate lyrics and melody captured me immediately and ripped a hole open in my heart. I also recommend watching the official music video for Take Me Home, it is brilliant and very moving. Jess Glynne said it was done all in one take and I believe that added to the raw, true emotion she was able to convey.\n\nEvery song, for me, is a 5\/5. This woman can do absolutely no wrong in my book. When you listen to the album, let your mind strip away the music and listen to the lyrics. This album tells a complete story. Feeling alone in the world. Finding someone that gets you. Falling in love. Doing everything possible to keep that love even though the other person wants more than you can give. Having your heart broken as your relationship, one you thought was with your soulmate, crumbles until you have no choice but to break up. Not falling out of love. Feeling angry because you gave your all to something that didn't work. Being able to pick yourself back up and breath again. It truly is wonderful. Jess Glynne is a powerhouse vocalist, emotional lyricist, and soulful person that is beautiful inside and out. Anything Jess Glynne touches will end up in my music library. Once I'm committed to an artist, any artist, I stick with them though all their growths and slumps. Something tells me, there will be no slumps in Jess Glynne's future. Cannot wait for more!","classification":5,"fold":4}

Her debut single Mercy really brings in a classic distinctive rhythm of classic 60's Blues and Soul, which is something we haven't heard on radio in awhile. The song isn't a bad song at all, but I just wish though that she could've brought in a little more grit into her voice on the song. Thankfully, though she does have a strong attitude on the song.

It graced the end of Halloween, the classic horror film and has been in any number of movies depicting the fifties era. I dare say it makes you feel like it's the fifties. The Chordettes are important in rock history as one of the first \"Girl Groups\" as they were called, to break into the charts at a time when sexism was standard practice and other phenomenal groups (Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Roy Orbison to name a few) were king. Many female vocalists existed but these harmonies belonged to the Chordettes and gave them a place. Mr. Sandman happens to be the creme de la creme of their work in my opinion.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"A very nice album -- I have to disagree with the reviewer who thought it sounded more \"early Eagles\" than country, for the whole approach to rhythm, not to mention the composition of the accompanying groups, creates what seems to me a different sound altogether.  Henley's voice is still at times that of the singer of \"Desperado,\" but he can adjust the timbre to suit a different mode.  At times, there's a touch of Dylan in the voice (in \"Prayin' for Rain\" and \"Where I am now\"),  and the narrative of \"Waiting on tables\" sounds like it could be a Springsteen song, until the refrain kicks in -- but they all work well.  All but four or five of the songs are by Henley and are new; the oldest one goes back to the '50's (the Louvin Brothers' \"When I Stop Dreaming\"), there are a couple from the '60s, including \"The Brand New Tennessee Waltz,\" and the disc opens with Tift Merritt's \"Bramble Rose.\"  I don't know that these are classics, but they're good songs, and Henley's own efforts fit right in.  I particularly liked \"The Cost Of Living,\" \"Words can Break your Heart,\" and \"Train in the Distance.\"  The themes are standard -- aging, loss, acceptance of failure, memories of youth -- but none the worse for that.\n\nThe engineering seems really good to me, with the voice perfectly set against the ensemble and the different expressive mixes in the arrangements coming through clearly.  Guest artists contribute -- Mick Jagger works hard at his county style and accent in \"Bramble Rose,\" and Merle Haggard sounds very good in \"The Cost of Living.\"  Alison Krauss, Trisha Yearwood, Vince Gill, Dolly Parton, and Lucinda Williams all contribute effectively.  This was Don Henley's first solo album in 15 years, and I thought it turned out just fine.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"According to Billboard they were among the top recording acts of the 1980's. Over a period spanning 16 years beginning in 1974 they recorded for three different labels, placed nearly three dozen singles on the Top 100 Singles chart and had several highly successful albums to boot. Yes, the music of Daryl Hall and John Oates seemed to be everywhere during this period.\n\nHall and Oates began their recording career at Atlantic records in the early 1970's. In 1974, they had a minor hit with a tune called \"She's Gone\". Although this record was not wildly successful it was clear that these guys were going to be a force to be reckoned with in the coming years. RCA records took note and signed Hall & Oates in 1975. Their very first release for the label \"Sara Smile\" was on the charts for some 7 months and peaked at #3 in the spring of 1976. Atlantic records took note and re-released \"She's Gone\" which also became a Top Ten hit in '76.  In January 1977 RCA released the boys' third single.  \"Rich Girl\" would become the first of six #1 singles for Hall & Oates spending two weeks at the top of the charts In March of that year.  As far as I am concerned this is one of the best songs they ever recorded.","classification":5,"fold":4}

I have been listening to them for about ten years now and enjoy their 70s output the most. I have albums from all of their different eras inclding their more recent live and studio albums and with that preface, I have to say that Fly from Here is my new favorite Yes album. I was very surprised when I found out that the band was going to release an album without Jon Anderson on vocals; the new singer, Benoit David, is actually far more enoyable to listen to than Anderson (blasphemy, I know). I was also pleasantly surprised to see Geoff Downes would be playing keyboards. Sqire, Howe, and White turn in the virtuosic performances Yes fans expect and in the twilight of their career, the prog-gods dig deep to write some of the best music they've ever put out. If you like progressive rock in the least or are a fan of Yes from any era, I highly recommend this album.

{"text":"I rediscovered this cd as I was going through my collection and felt sad that it wasn't the breakthrough that Fefe deserved.  I remember hearing the negative comparisons to Avril and that certainly didn't allow her target population to give her a chance but also the poor promotion by the label didn't fully expose her to the public.\n\nIt's a very strong debut collection from a young singer-songwriter which touches on love, friendship and her feelings about her absentee father.  Fefe displays her vocal ability on the \"softer\" moments of some songs and her overly exaggerated phrasing overall gives her vocal stylings a unique sound and at first I didn't appreciate it but the more I listened to this album, the more I grew to like her singing style.\n\nThe only criticism I have is that the tracks could've been ordered differently so that not all of the uptempo tracks are lumped together - it would've made for a more interesting listening experience.\n\nMy standout tracks are: TAKE ME AWAY (very strong track that caught my attention & made me curious enough to buy the entire album);\n\nEVERYTHING - I like the lyrics and how the softer moments of the song really show off her vocal skills\n\nSTUPID LITTLE LOVE SONG - such an unexpected track\n\nUNFORGIVEN - searing lyrics regarding her feelings for her absentee father & what that absence meant to her life\n\nREVOLUTION SONG - beautiful opening lyrics\n\nROCK IT TILL YOU DROP IT - fun track with a Tone Loc assist\n\nWE WENT FOR A RIDE - I love the musical arrangement and her more restrained vocals\n\nGIVE IT UP - this song starts off as a really sweet sounding track before seguing into an almost rap-like chant\n\nRAINBOWS (hidden track) - really sweet track that's different from any other on the disc, her vocals are excellent.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"It is more sophisticated and densely nuanced.  The song, like almost any song by the Band Led Zepplin, is well constructed and nicely produced.  The meaning is enigmatic but it allows many differing interpretations and I do not think that is bad.  With many lasting works of art, it will elicit different emotions and address many topics depending on the audience.  It starts with a simple , almost latin melody, and Robert comes in quietly and without hurry.  His narrative is leading and his melody makes you feel as if there is actual movement.  His matter of fact delivery is in line with his more mature sensibilities and the desperate angst of his youth is replaced with tension but not desperation.  At the end the melody continues even after the singer has completed his part.  Is it symbolic?  It is to me and that is all I can say.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"This single disc greatest hits release comprises fifteen tracks which isn't a bad tactic, just hit em between the eyes with your best tunes and walk out of the bar Its certainly better for some bands than a two disc set which does more to indicate they didn't have many great tunes!\n\nReleased in 2011 this release has no excuse (outside licensing etc.) to not include all the choicest cuts. And that makes me ponder why there wasn't more from the Twice Shy album which many would probably conclude was their high water mark. Ultimately tunes such as Move It, Heart the Hunter, Hiway Nights and even Babys on Fire have more heft and soul than many of the numbers on this disc.\n\nThere are however a bunch of the bands more rocking efforts such as their take on Once Bitten Twice Shy, Old Rose Motel and probably their biggest self-penned success of Mista Bone, a piece of double entendre that even Brian Johnson might have thought twice about. These numbers are spread throughout the disc and there was obvious thought given to the running order here as a range of the bands mellower numbers are interspersed throughout the track listing to break things up. The issue is that the band didn't really have that many pistol packers in their inventory, their harder numbers are hardly face melting to the point where any listener is going to be struggling for breath. And so many of their mellower numbers are poor creations.\n\nEffectively the problem is that Great White just weren't that good. Simple as that. And this collection explains why they were only second tier 80s hard rock on a good day, albeit theyd probably defend themselves by citing a preference for 70s slow burn rockers over 80s style histrionics. And a fair point that would be  but doesnt change that whatever they were aiming at, the results were rarely above fair to middling. Which is borne out by this release.\n\nAnother downside when viewing this release as a whole is that there is no lyrics, no insight, no liner notes, nothing at all on offer in the booklet. A couple of band pictures and the track listing with writing credits underneath. Taken as a package there is no personality here at all. Which at least keeps it in sync with the band in general.\n\nIf you have a hankering for 80s hard rock music you might want to look beyond the big bands of the era and start exploring the second tier and heck, even some of the third tier bands were good on their day and just failed to find their audience. However this release from Great White doesnt seem to do the band what middling justice they deserve. They had better and more lively tunes than much of what is here.\n\nPS - drumroll for the inevitable negative votes.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"A superb voice should never have a 'recession.' Keyshia Cole epitomizes this notion as she possesses an incredible voice that has shined in every capacity of which she's employed it. 2010's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Calling-All-Hearts\/dp\/B0042X90LQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Calling All Hearts<\/a>&nbsp;was not her best album, but it also was by no means bad, yielding strong cuts the likes of \"Long Way Down,\" \"Tired of Doing Me,\" and \"Take Me Away.\" But 2012's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Woman-To-Woman\/dp\/B00A3AUMK0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Woman To Woman<\/a>&nbsp;is better and closer to her best work on debut effort&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Way-It-Is\/dp\/B00096S3PY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Way It Is<\/a>&nbsp;and the valedictory sophomore effort&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Just-Like-You\/dp\/B000VDDCHO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Just Like You<\/a>.  The parallels unveil themselves throughout the emotional, inspired Woman To Woman, which finds Cole's brand of contemporary adult R&B at its best. She gets some help from Lil Wayne, Meek Mill, Ashanti, Elijah Blake, and Robin Thicke.  That said, none of the overshadow the chanteuse.\n\n\"Enough of No Love\" was the 'big hit' that Calling All Hearts was missing (The Nicki Minaj assisted \"I Ain't Thru\" wasn't quite it). Well produced by Harmony and laden with string patches and all the amenities of adult contemporary R&B, Cole sounds emotionally connected and tuned in. She talks a bit of trash, but doesn't overdo it as so many artists do today for shock value. By the chorus, she's on fire: \"Cause I-I can't stay here\/if there's no love\/yeah I-I can't stay here\/cause I've had enough\/enough of no love...\" Lil Wayne delivers a solid enough verse, reigning himself in and never overshadowing Cole. Excellent start by all means.\n\n\"Zero,\" featuring Meek Mill, is a turn at modern R&B with some minimalist aspects. It seems a bit restrained upon a first listen, but easily grows on you as one of the better cuts (not that any are bad) on Woman To Woman.  \"You see it pays to tell the truth, look at what you had to lose,\" Cole sings on the chorus \"...should think before you do, did you not know the rules?\" Meek Mill assists on the third verse; \"I lie just to protect you, never to disrespect you\/cause what we have was so 38 special...\" 2\/2 as of yet.\n\n\"Missing You\" gives Cole a solid, traditional R&B cut intact with fat, lazy bass line, contrasting the more modern tactics of \"Zero.\" Guitar-patch intact from The Way It Is's \"Love,\" Cole delivers with exemplary class on this Eric Hudson produced cut.\n\n\"Trust And Believe\" is Cole's \"I'm Going Down\" or \"Saving All My Love.\" It doesn't reach the classicism of either of the two cuts, but that is the parallel on this big ballad propelled by the tenets of classic soul and propelled by alt-R&B sensibilities.  Filled with many lyrical highlights, one incredibly memorable line is when Cole proclaims \"She's a 3, and I'm a 10...\" The chorus is where 'the money is': \"Trust and Believe me, you're gonna need me\/trust and believe me, she'll never be me\/and I'm so over you, go get lost\/boy I don't know who do you think that you are?\" Cole puts some 'stank' on the closing note (you just have to hear it).\n\nIf \"Trust And Believe\" wasn't enough of a hit, \"Get It Right\" 'gets it done' with old-school dusty drum programming and excellent adult contemporary R&B production by Mel and Mus. The vocal treatment at the onset is celestial, foreshadowing the strength of the cut.  Cole's vocals continue to captivate throughout, never faltering.  Delivering another catchy, emotion chorus, \"Get It Right\" makes five straight hits.\n\n\"Woman 2 Woman\" features a shocking collaboration with Ashanti. Surprisingly, the collaboration works better than one pre-judges with Ashanti complimenting Cole well.  \"Woman 2 Woman\" is certainly an extension of \"Trust\" from Cole's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/A-Different-Me\/dp\/B001H9N88Y\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">A Different Me<\/a>, a duet with Monica.  While \"Trust\" may have been more notable, \"Woman 2 Woman\" features all the right nuances and chemistry between both vocalists. Easily one of the stronger title tracks of 2012.\n\n\"Wonderland\" featuring Elijah Blake is another solid cut.  It is not preeminent as say \"Enough of No Love\" or \"Trust and Believe,\" but it is not too shabby either.  \"I Choose You\" is better, produced by Jack Splash and yielding a throwback soul sound.  Cole's upper register sounds exceptional on this cut, highlight on the chorus: \"If it ain't you, it's not worth it\/no matter what I do, nothing working\/baby I know love's not perfect\/even if he can save the world that will never be enough\/cause I choose you\/I choose you\/and If it ain't you, then it's just not worth it.\"\n\nOn \"Stubborn,\" Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins and Paul \"Hollywood Hotsauce\" Dawson give Cole more of a modern flair.  Being the talented vocalist\/artist that she is, Cole pulls it off. That said, Cole seems best suited for more refined, lush contemporary R&B cuts that hearken the past as opposed to the gimmickry. \"Hey Sexy\" provides appropriate atonement, characterized by its 80's styled R&B groove.  Throughout the course of the number, the addictive catch line \"I know you're not, not gonna sing that song...\" is repeated over and over.  The chorus is equally catchy: \"Sexy (sexy) rock me (rock me) all night long\/Hold me to the break of dawn\/I love it when you turn me on...\"\n\n\"Next Move,\" assisted by Robin Thicke's supporting vocals, loses no steam. Bink!'s production is superb, notable for the use of flute and hand percussion to create an incredibly lush opening.  Thicke simply supports Cole with harmonizing vocals, which is smart for this particular cut.  Right up Cole's alley, Cole 'kills' \"Next Move,\" a song that deals with deciding whether the male or female will make the 'next move' in the pending relationship, etc.\n\nClosing cut \"Signature\" takes on a mix of pop and R&B sensibility proving to be quite the appropriate closing track.  Cole's vocals grow large in scope on the nuances and ad libs toward the end in particular.  \"Signature\" caps off an excellent album.\n\nOverall, Woman To Woman finds Cole in excellent voice.  She is best when she connects with the material as she does here, particularly on soulful, heart wrenching numbers like \"Trust And Believe\" or \"I Choose You\" with its soulful stylings.  There are no misses with even the modern tinges of \"Stubborn\" ultimately not dragging Woman To Woman down, making this one of 2012's best urban offerings ultimately. It has stiff competition with the alt-R&B movement of Frank Ocean or Miguel, but along with Melanie Fiona and the best moments of Brandy's 'Two Eleven,' Cole shows that R&B is NOT dead.  4 stars; Enthusiastically recommended.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"I bought this album for \"Whom Shall I Fear (God of Angel Armies)\".  \"Whom Shall I Fear\" is one of my favorite songs, and I was in no way disappointed by the album.  As far as CCM goes, there is probably no better singer or songwriter than Chris Tomlin.  This album is quite different from Tomlin's previous albums, as far as style goes.  Tomlin's shift from writing with artists like Louie Giglio and Jesse Reeves to  artist like Matt Redman and Matt Maher has created a shift in style from classic P&W to more mainstream CCM.  \"Whom Shall I Fear\" and \"White Flag\" especially demonstrate Tomlin's new style. Lyrically, the \"Burning Lights\" album is focused more on revival, while Tomlin's previous albums are generally more praise and worship.  However, Tomlin's worshipful style still rings true in \"Crown Him: Majesty\" and \"Countless Wonders.\"  Altogether, I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes CCM; but if you are expecting a P&W album, you will be disappointed.","classification":5,"fold":4}

Unlike \"1,\" which excludes important tracks that didn't top the chart, the Blue album is a more comprehensive survey of the group's later work.  There's the deliciously trippy \"Strawberry Fields Forever,\" the impossibly catchy \"Revolution,\" George Harrison's masterpiece \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" and a personal favorite of mine, the bluesy b-side \"Don't Let Me Down.\"  Another gem is John Lennon's strikingly beautiful \"Across the Universe\" pulled from the \"Let it Be\" album.

Look at all the 1-star reviews - that should tell you something.\n\nIf you want to enjoy \"Autumn Leaves\" then listen to the instrumental version done by Miles Davis and Cannonball Adderley back in the '50s.

{"text":"Wondering what the fuss is about? First, look at the playlist. On the face of it, it would appear to be an adequate playlist of better than average songs, but no earth-shakers. However, they are all sung by Jackie Evancho. In so doing, she elevates each and every song on the list to a new height. After you've listened just once, each of these songs will take on new meaning for you. You will never again be able to listen to anyone else's version without comparing them to Jackie's. \"What A Wonderful World\" - \"My Heart Will Go On\" - \"Pure Imagination\" - \"Music Of The Night\" - and my favorite, \"Come What May\" with The Tenors, where her sense of harmony is showcased in a dazzling display. She alternately sings the melody, the high harmony and the low harmony with Frasier, Victor and Clifton. Very sophisticated harmony.\n\nSo, sit back and think of your favorite Soprano, that one special singer who has done the best to reach you. Throughout history there has been a short list of truly gifted singers. Jackie should now go to the head of that class because her voice is so rich and clear that only a small handful of singers are on the same plane with her voice. On top of that, Jackie has that extraordinarily rare ability to penetrate a listener's emotional defenses and affect them to their very core so deftly, readily, and completely.\n\nShe sings directly from her heart to yours, with total sincerity and honesty - singing what SHE WANTS you to hear, NOT what she THINKS YOU WANT to hear. Be forewarned, You can prepare you emotional defenses in anticipation. It won't work. She'll draw you in and get to you, just as she has gotten to so many others.\n\n\"What a wonderful World\" deserves special consideration. It won't be like anything you remember. Armstrong and others, when they sang it, it was more a wistful retrospective on their past lives. As Jackie sings it, she transforms it to a hopeful promise of a beautiful world yet to unfold. She TOTALLY changes the song's dynamics. It will surprise you.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Bruno Mars literally sprung up out of nowhere this year when he appeared on B.O.B.'s hit single Nothin On You.  He had an undeniably smooth voice with a unique quality that made him instantly likable.  I will admit that Bruno Mars does show flashes of Michael Jackson in his voice in the same type of way that Ne-Yo has some shades of MJ in his voice.  This is not to say he sings or sounds like Michael, just that certain notes he hits reminds of the late great.  However that little quality did not cause me to overrate this album.  Bruno Mars is extremely talented and is a star waiting to happen.\n\nHaving also appeared on Travie McCoy's successful single Billionaire as well as helping produce the magnificent Cee-Lo Green single \"F You\", Bruno finally drops his much anticipated album.  Earlier he released a 4 song EP \"Its Better If You Don't Understand\" which was a great record.  However, 3 of those 4 songs made it to his debut album Doo Wops & Hooligans.  That would not be so bad if the album was longer than 10 tracks.  It's still not really a problem since the album is filled with great songs.  The single Just The Way You Are is 5 stars all the way as well as Grenade, Talking To The Moon and Lazy Song.  Bruno Mars mixes soul with reggae and pop but does so effortlessly and with such style and grace.  Vocally he's one of the best male singers to emerge in quite a while and the production is timeless.  The lyrics are original and sung with passion. Cee-Lo Green, B.O.B., and Damian Marley make cameos but Bruno was not outshined on his own project.\n\nDoo Wops & Hooligans is easily one of the better albums of the year.  I'd rank it up there with Janelle Monae, Nneka, and Corinne Bailey Rae's efforts.  It's unfortunate that Bruno Mars has encountered a bit of trouble as this album was released but it's easy to see he has the talent to be a cornerstone in music for years to come. 5 stars.","classification":5,"fold":4}

If there had been  a law stating; \"No entertainer shall remind the audience of any  other\", rock'n'roll would have lasted about 18 months in the late  'Fifties and all the artists good enough to have careers would have been  absorbed by other genres. Rare Earth didn't do a thing Three Dog Night and  Grand Funk Railroad hadn't already done (as well as the Rascals before  that), but they were damn good players and that was all that was necessary.  The only thing that puzzles me about this group is how a blond-haired  drummer\/ lead singer named Pete started out being named Rivera (obviously  Hispanic) and ended up being named Hoorelbeke in later albums (sounds Dutch  to me). You listen to the vocals and it's the same guy, not two different  guys. The thing that bothers me is that I used to have a complete  collection by Rare Earth, but I lost the first self-titled album years ago.  There aren't but two or three titles still available, but that ain't one of  'em.

{"text":"I think most fans of Stephen Stills are aware of his history, and specifically that in the last few years he seems to have (thankfully) gotten his act together, cleaned himself up, and shed quite a few pounds. And like anything else in life, the hard-living years have taken their toll. That said...this was a pretty decent set. I've heard better versions of his signature acoustic track \"Treetop Flyer,\" and the opening electric track...\"Isn't It About Time\"...is a little too rough around the edges for me, considering how tight, smooth and slithery it came across on the second Manassas album.\n\nBut then he launches into an insane \"Neil Young & Crazy Horse \/ Weld\" version of \"Rock & Roll Woman\"...one of his greatest Springfield tracks...and all is well with the world.\n\n\"Wounded World\" sounds a little too close to his earlier solo track \"Right By You,\" but considering the fact that it's used here to set up \"Rocky Mountain Way\" in the second half, that's OK, and a sloppy, raucous version it is, but hey...it's only rock and roll. He did something similar on his 1975 solo album, \"Stephen Stills Live,\" using the song \"Jet Set (Sigh)\" from the first Manassas album to set up \"R.M.W.\"\n\n\"Bluebird\" and \"For What It's Worth\" also get the \"Weld\" treatment. This might turn off some long-time fans and purists, but c'est la vie.\n\n\"Love The One You're With\" is a bit of an anti-climactic climax to an 80-minute disc...sure, it's one of his biggest solo hits, maybe THE biggest, but it seems more like an afterthought and less like an inspired performance.\n\nI do know what I like, and sometimes it's stuff that's in the mainstream and adored by millions, other times it's not. This may be one of those \"other\" times. For me, the Springfield trilogy...especially \"Rock & Roll Woman\"...made it worth the price of admission. The reunion at Bridge School it ain't...but it rips and stomps like a rock & roll survivor with something still left to prove, on both the electric AND acoustic tracks.","classification":4,"fold":4}

I actually have the greatest hits CD from whence this came, but it was packed away in a box after an arduous move and I really wanted to hear it. The download is very reasonably priced and is generally easy (though settings can go astray if you have never done it before.)\n\nThe song itself is a lighthearted love song, and I have listened to it now on numerous occasions for two primary reasons: first, it's just a great song; second, it helped me prepare for my initial karaoke outing on a cruise ship. The quirky lyrics, ranging from exotic pets to John Merrick's remains, are humorous, quirky, and actually work well as a sweet and endearing song.

{"text":"The title of this CD is misleading.  It is not the 2nd set from the earlier \"An Evening With the Allman Brothers-First Set\".\nIn 1989, the Allman Brothers reformed, adding Warren Haynes on guitar and Allen Woody on bass.  They recorded the studio albums \"Seven Turns\" and \"Shades of Two Worlds\".  Next came \"An Evening With the Allman Brothers\", which was recorded in 1991.  On the cover in little print, was written \"First Set\".  They then recorded the studio album \"Where It All Belongs\".  In 1994 they went on tour again, and released a CD from the tour called \"2nd Set\".\nThis CD is very good, but not quite as good as the \"First Set\".  The old songs are played in new and exciting ways.  The acoustic version of \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\", is very interesting (but not stunning).  The new songs are all very good.  The real show piece is \"Back To Where We Belong\".  It ends with a 15 minute version of \"Jessica\" that doesn't sound very much like \"Jessica\".  There is alot of jamming and playing around with bits of \"Mountain Jam\" thrown in.  There are no bad spots in the CD, but it doesn't have the continous intensity of the \"First Set\".\nNote that \"First Set\", \"2nd Set\" and \"Seven Turns\" can be bought together as low priced packaged set.\nAfter this CD, Haynes and Woody left the group to concentrate on their side project Gov't Mule.  Woody died last year and Haynes is now playing with Phil Lesh and Friends.  The Allman Brothers reformed once more, with Butch Trucks' nephew on guitar.  Dickie Betts has been temporarily kicked out of the band.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"If there's one band that has defined consistency within the rock genre over the last 15 years (give or take), it would be Chevelle. What started off as a few skateboarders riffing on Helmet and Tool quickly turned into a hit-single churning force that has now evolved into a hard rocking power trio that are an island unto themselves. Think of all those bands Chevelle shared radio (and stage) space with back in the 2000s. Think of how awful a lot of those bands have become. Here we have Chevelle, on their eighth studio album, still on a major label and yet not shedding one single ounce of integrity.\n\nIn fact, \"The North Corridor\" may be their heaviest and densest album to date. Re-teaming with Joe Barresi, who also produced the band's previous two albums, Chevelle have crafted a tightly-wound ten song set that plays to their strengths as an even tighter live act. The album busts open with \"Door To Door Cannibals,\" the sort of song Page Hamilton should really be pounding out at this point in his career. Thick guitar riffs careen over the ever-reliable rhythm section while frontman Pete Loeffler stabs and howls his way through what is essentially an anti-single. Likewise, the other nine tracks aren't the sort of thing you're bound to hear alongside the current crop of over-produced rock bands. On \"Young Wicked,\" the main Loeffler seems to be echoing golden-era Maynard James Keenan as he snarls and fights against the gravity of the music. While there's nothing here that screams \"hit single,\" \"Joyride (The Omen)\" comes close in its fierce catchiness. Like most of the album it's punchy and to the point, fierce and intensely focused.\n\nAs always, Barresi's production does the band sweet, sweet justice. Dean Bernardini's thunderous basslines drive many of the songs, while drummer Sam Loeffler is, as always, the key ingredient to the band. Few modern rock drummers can match his air-tight and infectious delivery, and it locks in perfectly with Pete's hooky guitar riffs. While it's true that Chevelle still sound very much like Chevelle, it's amazing how they can keep hammering away at their own brand and still churn out gold like this. Few bands of this ilk have mastered the art of maintaining their identity without repeating themselves, but \"The North Corridor\" not only continues to push the band along on its journey, but pays tribute to the young music-loving kids that started the whole thing to begin with as well. \"The North Corridor\" is a sound so big and overwhelming that, frankly, it's like throwing a hot dog down a hallway.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too.

{"text":"I first noticed Regina Spektor on the Letterman show, and she blew me away.\nHer music was infectious, the words so original and descriptive. Her expressions surprising and her delivery superb. And, then I listened to her interview on NPR's 'Fresh Air'and was captivated by her style and originality. I purchased her CD and listened many times.\n\nFirst of all, Regina's voice is one of the most distinctive out there. She can go from musing and romantic to silly and fun, but never frivolous. Her words and their music are too serious. Regina immigrated from Russian as a small child. She and her parents lived in New York City where she was introduced to music everyday, the Beatles, classic rock, folk songs and classical music. She studied music as a small child and then moved from classical music to her now eclectic style. She is well known for her originality and her style. Many television shows use her music, and now she has become recognized. Regina Skeptor is a classic.\n\nHer latest CD is exciting. My favorite is the song about museums and the paintings wanting to jump off the walls, 'All The Rowboats', with her distinctive vocalizations. Then 'Ballad Of A Politician', with it's superb satire, \"shaking, shaking hand; Shake It, Shake It Baby'. The other tunes fall into place and deserve a place of their own.\n\nRegina has a constant discussion with her piano tuners about the loudness and banging that occurs. She wants a smoother, more soothing style, and, she has to let them know this is her style, this is who she is. She is a romantic unusual stylist with a voice that overcomes any singular complaint. She is superb, what more can be said?\n\nHighly Recommended. prisrob 09-06-12\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/My-Dear-Acquaintance-A-Happy-New-Year\/dp\/B001MYHBPU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">My Dear Acquaintance [A Happy New Year<\/a>]\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Far\/dp\/B002COTI64\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Far<\/a>","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Up until this past summer, when 2008 fifth-place finisher Brooke White released HIGH HOPES AND HEARTBREAK, I had overwhelmingly ignored practically every artist that was ever on \"American Idol\" that ever released an album.  I just felt, and still largely do, that even as it tries to promote new talent, it also seems to promote the continued corporate approach to pop music of today.  Brooke's album was the sole exception up to that point, a breezy bit of 1970s California-inspired pop.\n\nIn her wake, then, there is Katharine McPhee, who finished second to Taylor Hicks on \"Idol\" in 2006.  I wasn't exactly high on her self-titled post-\"Idol\" 2007 album, thinking it sounded like everything else on today's adult contemporary and R&B radio.  However, her second album, UNBROKEN, is a different sort of album from its predecessor.  For while it still contains the AC and R&B elements of its predecessor, there is a noticeable emphasis, as there was on Brooke's album, on acoustic-influenced 1970s pop elements, like on \"Lifetime\", and the up-tempo \"Had It All\".  Katharine also does a fairly good vocal workout on \"Faultline\" without resorting to the irritating melisma that seems to be part-and-parcel of far too many divas that will remain nameless.  She gets able assistance, both in the writing and performing aspects of the songs, from people like Rachel Yamagata and veteran guitarist Mark Goldenberg, who worked with rock icon Linda Ronstadt thirty years before on her somewhat controversial but hugely successful 1980 new-wave rock album MAD LOVE.  The big surprise in this collection, however, is Katharine's reggae-influenced cover of \"Brand New Key\", which had been a #1 hit for three weeks in the winter of 1971-72 for folk-pop songstress Melanie.  Katharine claimed that she had not heard Melanie's original before she was about ready to record it, but she sounds quite comfortable doing it.\n\nIt's this kind of largely uncluttered production on UNBROKEN that, like Brooke's album from '09, sets it apart from the more hyped-up \"Idol\" divas Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood: nothing extreme, everything done just right and tasteful, but with a good deal of originality.  This may likely end up being one of my personal favorites in 2010.","classification":5,"fold":4}

If you're looking 4 more WHINING vocals from the lead singer you can forget it. He has finally reached P*berty and no longer sounds like Eminem. The lyrics to me just seem so much more mature and the group has collaborated so well with each other to create such an amazing piece of ART. I've noticed the roaster contains some big name producers and that is probably what everyone is experiencing on the shift in sound. But it's a very small semi change. The change actually seems like it's for the better. \"I Can Wait Forever\" has got to be one of my favorite songs on this album. It's a stand out track and is also an amazing ROCK BALLAD. Almost every song on this album is a 5 star track and the leads singer's voice really sounds so soothing and beautiful this time around. The hooks to the CHORUS lines are beyond ADDICTIVE.

{"text":"Shawn Colvin's \"Uncovered\" got a number of lackluster reviews for being too bland, too soft.  It is a quiet acoustic disc with tempos largely on the slower side.  But there are some real gems here, well worth repeated listening that make the set indeed welcome.  Perhaps my very favorite is Paul Simon's \"American Tune\" which is such a fine song, giving voice to idealistic disappointment.  Sean's voice aches expressively and polishes Simon's gorgeous melody, \"Many's the time I've been mistaken, and many times confused; and I've often felt forsaken and certainly misused.\"  The Brenton Wood hit \"Gimme A Little Sign\" has a little more bounce than the surrounding tracks with Sean's pace slower than the original, letting her stretch out the lyrical feeling.  \"Where is my God, He lives inside on me,\" Shawn sings on the Stevie Wonder-penned devotional \"Heaven Is Ten Zillion Light Years Away.\"  Other tracks are strong like her take on \"Baker Street,\" Neil Finn's \"Private Universe\" & the country arrangement of \"Lodi.\"  \"Uncovered\" is a strong, albeit quiet set.

{"text":"While I'm someone who normally seeks underrated, forgotten or rare music and prefers to claim those as some of the best songs ever written just to spark some excitement and show some appreciation for bands that never got a fair shake, I do have to make some exceptions from time to time.  Scandal's \"Goodbye To You\" is a MAJOR exception!  Nothing and I mean NOTHING gets my adrenaline pumping quite like Scandal's \"Goodbye To You\".\n\nAs many of you hopefully know, Patty Smyth is a gifted singer.  Her solo career and Horses perfectly reveals this, but WOW did she ever nail a perfect song with \"Goodbye To You\".  We're talking the right vocal range, the right set of emotions, the right conditions, the right singer for the role, the right period in time... everything was spot-on for this particular occasion.  The lyrics illustrate how frustrated she feels from all the times she waited for a love that's not worth the aggravation, and she elevates her vocal range to proportions in so many different categories that when I'm not enjoying the vocal melody, I'm paying close attention to her amazing vocal techniques.\n\nAnd the part that floors me the most?  When her voice dramatically builds revealing heartache and despair as she sings the line \"And my love, and my love, and my love, and my love won't stand the pa-a-ain.  And my heart, and my heart, and my heart, and my heart can't stand the stra-a-ain\" and how this kind of melodic chaotic confusing carnival-like synth part plays immediately afterwards. THIS WHOLE PART IS AWESOME!  And then there's all kinds of \"Ooooh oh oh oh ohs!\" that Patty uses that all sound perfectly natural.  I feel a strong connection to this song and Patty's voice in particular.  No doubt about it!\n\nWhat a shame this song isn't heard on FM radio anymore.  A dog on shame.  Please enjoy this song!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I've been listening to Foreigner since 1977 when they came out with their self-titled first album.  By the way, to this day, their best all the way around.  From the music and to the fantastic harmonies, the group could never top that album.  As the years went on, band mates left, the group got smaller and then the lead singer had serious health issues and left the band also.  Today, Mick Jones continues the legacy of the band with new members and along with Kelly Hansen, lead vocalist, keep the flame alive.  Once again, some fans hate the new band because who could ever replace Lou Gramm.  To be honest, no one can as no one can replace Steve Perry or Dennis DeYoung or Peter Gabriel or David Lee Roth or Phil Collins.  You get my point. At this point, it is what it is.  The first cd I love and basically is what I downloaded. I have the other tunes in their classic form and really wasn't interested in that, but wanted to hear these songs done acoustically and I think Mick and the band have done a fine job here.  If you're a Foreigner fan I really can't see anything not to like here, unless you're just prejudiced against a different singer then Lou Gramm.  Lou Gramm was the heart of Foreigner as far as the singer, but times change, people change, people move on and Mick, I guess, just wanted to keep playing music.  Call it whatever you want as far as the whole release thing with CD 2, but pick up the first cd and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.","classification":5,"fold":4}

Here you will find her second and third Warner albums (Cage the songbird, from 1983, and Nobody wants to be alone, from 1984). I do not play these albums as often as most of Crystal's other music but I always enjoy hearing them. They are high quality albums featuring the type of pop-country music that was popular on American country radio at the time, helping to maintain Crystal's position as one of the most important female singers in country music at the time, though she did not maintain that position for much longer.\n\nThe title track of Cage the Songbird is a cover of a relatively obscure but wonderful Elton John song. Other great songs include The sound of goodbye, I don't wanna lose your love and Turning away as well as fine covers of Victim or a fool (Rodney Crowell) and Take me home (Tom Waits).\n\nThe second album here, Nobody wants to be alone, is similar in style and quality. It includes more great songs such as A long and lasting love, Tonight tonight, the title track, Coming to the dance and Touch and go.\n\nIf you are a fan of Crystal's music, you will love these albums.

{"text":"Everyone knows who Jamie Foxx is: an Oscar-winning actor, and not a bad singer either. But when it comes to his albums, I have to say that he's yet another one of those artists that makes very good SINGLES. Such is the case with his latest album, Intuition.\n\n\"Just Like Me\" is a pretty interesting song, and although I'm not a big fan of auto-tune, \"Blame It\" is one of the best tracks. Even so, there are two issues I have with it: 1) the Tonight Show proved that Jamie could sing this song perfectly well WITHOUT using auto-tune (as reviewer P. Duncan said best; more on that later), and 2) even though T-Pain did announce his name before his verse started, could you really tell the difference between his and Jamie's parts? Anyway, the necessary end-of-album keep-your-head-up song \"Love Brings Change\" actually ends the album nicely.\n\nWhen I think of missteps, I once again refer to P. Duncan. The fast songs are best catered to men half Jamie's age. In the obligatory song featuring Lil Wayne, \"Number One\", a sample of Beastie Boys' \"The New Style\" is used in such a way that it makes the production sound like some rejected Pac-Man background music (Just Blaze produced that???). But the song was already on shaky ground with Wayne making bizarre puns like \"Girl if you're gay\/I can be your Marvin.\" (WTF?) And \"I Don't Need It\" made me say just that. Sexual ballads aren't the best either; well, \"Freak'in Me\" is tolerable, but I think most people would rather hear Marsha Ambrosius talk about making love, not freakin'. And \"Slow\" is skippable not only because of that silly \"mmm mmm mmm mmm fine\" part during the second verse, but also because of lines like \"I gotta take my time with you `cause your ish is the ish\" and \"Ima break that body like a cake\". What?\n\nBut I guess I shouldn't be surprised by the lyrics in the latter because that's one of the three songs on here written by Tricky and The-Dream (the other two being \"Rainman\" and the corny \"Digital Girl\"). Everything else is okay, but if you're not a big fan of Jamie's music, B.I.F.\n\nAnthony Rupert","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"Chris Cornell returns with another high quality acoustic guitar driven solo album that allows his legendary voice to shine through over some interesting songs that solidify his reputation as a successful rock survivor. Produced by Brendan O'Brien (Brice Springsteen and Pearl Jam), Higher Truth is a mainly stripped back collection of singer-songwriter based tracks with a few moments of rock featuring additional instrumentation by Brendan O'Brien, Patrick Warren, and Matt Chaimberlain. This style of acoustic performance has served Cornell well over the past few years with sold out shows all over the world and the successful release of his previous Songbook album. Fans looking for a hard rock album will have to wait for a new release by Soundgarden because this is truly a solo album that focuses on meaningful lyrics and acoustic guitar backings. Highlights include the strong album opener \"Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart\" featuring an awesome mandolin part, the tasty acoustic ballad \"Before We Disappear\", the moving vibe of \"Through The Window\", and the lullaby sounds of \"Circling\". The deluxe edition contains four excellent bonus tracks including a classic sounding ballad \"Bend In The Road\", the very dark and moody vibe of \"Wrong Side\", the absolutely stunning vocal performance of \"Misery Chain\", and a remix of \"Our Time In The Universe\". Despite the fact that Higher Truth doesn't quite reach the rocking heights of some of Cornell's previous work, it is certainly a very mature album that sets a relaxed mood that will further reinforce Cornell's legacy as a gifted artist. Looking forward to experiencing these songs at one of his acoustic shows - 4.5 stars.","classification":4,"fold":4}

The album's title and lead track \"Live To Win\" is a statement that Paul has live by since KISS debuted back in 1974. This time Mr. Stanley surrounded himself with people that are on the \"A\" list in 2006 such as songwriters Andreas Carlsson, Desmond Child & John \"5\" Lowery. I believe this album will \"Lift\" you up and make you \"Bulletproof\" as Paul's voice is more diverse than what he did in KISS. Make no bones about it, this is Paul Stanley moving forward as an artist as well as giving the occasional nod to his past but he is making sure that this collections will tread only \"Where Angels Dare\" so you won't \"Wake Up Screaming\".

{"text":"A review in 3 parts:\n\nPart I: Dream Theater has put out concept albums before.  Theyve put out double and triple albums.  They are a well-known and well-regarded group of gifted musicians with backing deals and monetary funds to help them put out products of excellence and ambition that lesser known bands simply cant compete against.  So then how can they put out a conceptual double album that fizzles out practically before it even gets started?  One of my favorite bands, a small little independent group called The Violet Burning, with a pittance of a following put out a conceptual triple album a few years ago (around the time that Green Day got some mild publicity for releasing three albums in three months if I recall correctly) that blew my socks off.  How could they pull that feat off but Dream Theater put out a wishy washy (dare I say wimpy) piece of fluff like this?  It boggles my mind.  I expect so so so much more from them.  Theyve got such a great catalog!  But not this.\n\nPart II: The Astonishing is musically mild.  It is rarely heavy and hardly ever muscular.  Its melodies are underwhelming.  Youll find ambient and future-computer-code sounds, which are perhaps the most musically interesting tracks on the album, sprinkled throughout.  Youll hear a song that starts out like a Christmas tune (Im not kiddingcheck out A Savior In the Square) and I even had a moment listening to one of the tracks that made me recall The Carpenters of all bands!  What is this!?!  Dream Theater has thrown their chops around with ballads and even some close-to-standard rock songs but they usually stay close to the progressive metal sphere and love to let their collective hair down on epic tracks that take their time and take the listener on an adventure.  Theyve eschewed all of that this time around in favor of a wealth of short to average length songs that allow keyboard concepts to mostly take the leads.  Sure the guitar is there but it is almost always playing second fiddle to other elements of the song, or providing an additional melody.  If there are wild drum and bass excursions then Ive missed them amidst all of the songs trying to bewell, songs, that all add up to a story.  A hackneyed, dystopian future where a musical genius can be the savior story.  The packaging is pretty!  The interior booklet has some nice art in it!  But that cant make me like these songs.  There are a couple that pass muster but theres nothing that is anywhere near the greatness that Dream Theater can achieve.  I enjoy the feel good arena rockish anthem Our New World.  LaBrie sounds pretty good there and its rousing, but theres little else that generates serious interest.\n\nPart III: Concepts albums may be harder to pull off than a regular release but in the end, just like regular releases, they have just as good a chance to be cool or to suck.  This one sucks.  It doesnt suck because of the production.  Productions fine, sound levels are paid attention to, arrangements while lacking the usual DT dynamic are still tight, and the musicianship is fine.  But it sucks because its boring.  And the story is linear, obvious, surface, and just boring.  Sure there are other concept albums that fail (check out, or better yet dont, P.O.D.s The Awakening) but there have been so many great ones.  DT has a few of their own with Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence being at the top of my list.  But what this album needed this time around to really help it out was different voices.  LaBrie carries the vocals and speaks for many different characters and because he cant make them distinct characters via his own voice he ends up hurting this release (it still wouldnt have been great even if they used other vocalists though).  I wonder if he remembered working on Ayreons The Human Equation and heard that fantastic end product, carried through by a variety of singers, to work out its concept exquisitely?  Did he ever think of doing the same?  Well never know.  Best to put this one behind us and move on.\n\nWhen all is said and done one can listen to the album and not hate it.  You can find some different points of interest.  But I think that, as a whole, you're hard pressed to find that you enjoy the entirety.  I think most Dream Theater fans will be mightily disappointed and I don't see this making many new fans.  Not even of bands like Nightwish, Epica, Vanden Plas and others who play up offerings similar to this.  They at least do them up pretty well.  I want DT to go back and play their long songs.  2.5 stars of disappointment.","classification":2,"fold":4}

{"text":"Based on the reviews, I bought this album with high hopes of having another good Christmas album.  I should have known better.  What I got is a supposed \"Christmas\" album that really has nothing to do with Christmas other than the lyrics and the traditions of the song.  This sounds like a competent garage band just messing around with arrangements, but not really doing anything new, different, or exciting to any of the songs.  Musically, this sounds like just another Contemporary Christian album, but not a Christmas album.\n\nIn many ways, it sounds like the CCM response to Trans-Siberian Orchestra, but with much less of a Christmas feel to it.  While TSO maintained the reverence and ambience of the season, this set degrades far too often into a \"look what I can do with my guitar\" feel, the kind of adolescent muscle-flexing that turns out to be more annoying than gratifying.  And while TSO uses various vocalists to complement their guitar-driven pieces, Lincoln's voice grows thin by the third song--there are hardly even any strong backing vocals to complement him.\n\nWhile others seem to think that \"Miraculum\" is a high point, it's by far the most TSO-influenced track here, and by far the least successful--it's more annoying than anything with the guitars that seem to be played more to impress than express.\n\nAll in all, there's so much good Christmas music out there that this one will never be played again in our house, I'm sure.  There's nothing that reminds me of Christmas at all, nothing that puts me in the holiday spirit.  Give me the Matthew West or the Casting Crowns or the Sarah McLachlan or the TSO (except the third) or the Amy Grant (also except the third) Christmas albums any day--they capture the spirit of the season.","classification":2,"fold":4}

{"text":"It was in 2001, when the punk group Sum-41 finally hit it big with the release of their breakthrough album: ALL KILLER NO FILLER. The band received radio and televised airplay like crazy. Sum-41 also landed soundtrack spots for copilation CD's, the film Spider-man, and the television show Malcom In The Middle. It was clear that the public had finally come around to listening to the punk group's music. The public had good reason. Sum-41 has a great sense of when and how much distortion to use in their very interesting and fast paced rhythm changes. The guitars have a great taste in creating simple but very unique melodies. The bass gives the extra fill in creating the band's harmonies, and the drums keep everything together. The lyrics to ALL KILLER NO FILLER are amusing and can even be considered to be slightly contraversial for the track \"Fat Lip\". The lyricist makes honest and \"in your ears\" remarks about society and its expectations of its citizens. ALL KILLER NO FILLER is a fun piece of work, and one I highly recomend hearing in its entirity.\n\nStand out tracks include:\n\"Fat Lip\"\n\"Rhythms\"\n\"Motivation\"\n\"In Too Deep\"","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Every now and again, Amazon will release a ton public-domain music for a very low price.  Right now, 131 tracks of Mozart's work is being offered for $0.99!  Often, these bundles will drop down to under a buck for a very limited time before shooting back up to around $7.99.  If you're reading this review and the price is set at $0.99, buy this now.  If you're reading this review and the price is much higher, place this on your Wish List and keep an eye on it -- it will likely drop back down in price soon.\n\nThis \"Big Mozart Box\" is very similar to the \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Beethoven-Box\/dp\/B00AOMZHSO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Beethoven Box<\/a>\".  Many of these tracks you might be able to find here with a bit better quality -- because many of these compositions are performed by different groups and different venues, there's a lot of variability in the volume, timbre, and noise-levels between songs.  For most people, the quality of the recordings shouldn't be a problem, but Mozart purists might find a few tracks a bit annoying.  For those unfamiliar with Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a musical prodigy that wrote and defined some of the best music of all time.  Composing in the mid-to-late 1700's, his music has stood the test of time, and he's proven himself to be one of the most gifted composers -- period.\n\nThe Big Mozart Box is a great find for anyone looking to get into the music of Mozart or just classical music in general.  Clocking in at around 14 hours, it's harder to find a better deal on music without plain out stealing it.  While this bundle doesn't include everything Mozart ever created, it does include a great sampling of his concertos, operas (no vocals featured here though), and quartet arrangements.  At $0.99, this is a phenomenal deal.","classification":5,"fold":4}

The use of sharp interventions in the binaural  pattern by high pitched flute and loud piano passages severely damaged the serenity and void nature of any consistency in theme.  Mediations start in the hectic real world and progressively drop layers of extraneous thoughts and interrupting distractions progressing deeper into pure uninterrupted silent, still, clearness.

{"text":"I remember hearing \"Crazy\" on the radio all the time, and it was another one of those cases where I hear a great song and then I ask people who that is singing it -- and nobody seems to know. I went to pick up Javier's album to see if there were any more songs like that on there. And the answer is yes.\nJavier appears to be caught in the group of overlooked singers, as his self-titled debut is a great album full of light soul songs, with a little bit of blues thrown in here and there. If you want to enjoy some other snap-your-fingers style jams like \"Crazy\", try throwing on \"She Spoke To Me\" or \"Slow Motion\" (the latter kind of reminds me of \"Don't You Forget It\" by Glenn Lewis [another overlooked singer]). Slow songs are also good, as evidenced by my favorite track, \"Biggest Mistake\", which is what you'll do if you don't play this song.\nThe songwriting is a highlight as well. Never before have I heard such well-crafted stories like the bluesy \"October Sky\" and, although slighty sappy, \"If I Never Get To Heaven\". The former talks about how his girl suddenly changed her ways, while the latter explains what his woman's love means to him. The fact that Javier had written or co-written all the songs himself especially makes these tracks stand out.\nSome of the lyrics in \"Beautful U R\" come off a little trite, and \"She'll Never Know\" is kind of confusing, but those aspects can't ruin a great album like this. This album won't be leaving my stereo anytime soon.\nAnthony Rupert","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"After pounding out an R.E.M. sound-alike in 2011 in the form of \"The King Is Dead,\" The Decemberists back up a bit for the more middle of the road \"What A Terrible World, What A Wonderful World.\" There are some subtle changes, like heavier strings and horn charts, which are good. The band that crafted CD long suites now starts off an album with a song where the band apologizes for making a commercial for Axe Shampoo (\"The Singer Addresses His Audience\"). They know they aren't the same band that cut the masterful \"The Crane Wife,\" and openly admit such.\n\nWhat they are for \"What a Terrible World...\" are a crafter of songs. They've found a sweet spot between the ornate structure of those early albums to a sense of pop melody. It makes a love song like \"Philomenia\" all the more jaunty and \"Lake Song\" a hip folkie haunter. The band also sound more integrated this time around, where \"The King Is Dead\" was a showcase for Chris Funk, here, piano dominates many of the songs.  Me. I kind of like when they get into that folk vein, as one of my favorites here Colin Malloy almost making a sea shanty song out of \"Better Not Wake The Baby.\"\n\n\"What a Terrible World...\" will probably polarize fans who can't get over the fact that the band hit an early peak and then decided to try other things. As for me, I can respect that The Decemberists are not content to stay in one place for every album. Maybe they still aspire to be R.E.M. or even 10,000 Maniacs (some of the poetic lyrics recall the Maniacs'). What ever direction they travel, I am happy to follow as long as the music is this good.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"When I first heard this song on the radio, I was like, 'Wow, that's a change of pace.' And it was, after the usual modern rock chart-toppers they marched out one-by-one, this song is a refreshing change until... Radio drags it through the mud that is their airwaves 10 times a day. It was after a little while of that that I got more of a critical eye with the song as I came up with reasons to hate the song that was so overplayed by radio jocks. So first off, while the verses are good, the chorus, especially the last couple rounds of it in the last minute or so in the song, turns away from that, and falls flat, making it a flat love song at the end.\n\nSo overall, great verses, bad chorus. Maybe not the best of songs to win your lovers hand. But in any case, it's a good shake-up from the usual Nickelback.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Basie's best players come to Duke's place, the Columbia Records 30th Street Studios in 1961 and face Ellington's finest. Not a battle, but not quite a merger, either, since the Count's contingent is heard in one speaker and their hosts in another channel. There's more than an hour of good music on here, laid down in the dying days of big jazz touring orchestras. Popular tastes had changed and the costs of keeping large groups of players together were impossible. This is one of those rare CD's in which the booklet is almost as good as the music. This one reveals that during this 12-hour late-afternoon-to-early-morning session, one of Ellington's long-time employees quit the group forever because the boss would not take his side in a fight with a colleague. Also interesting is the dispute over the title and cover graphics. Basie hated Columbia's first idea to bill the date as a competition, and his agent even destroyed the only copy of the original cover art. The end result is an album whose sales over 40 years have been hurt because no one knows its name. The cover finally chosen says \"The Count Meets the Duke\" but in larger letters it declares \"FIRST TIME!\" and then adds \"2 Great Orchestras\" and finally states \"Duke Ellington and Count Basie.\" The label Columbia\/Sony put on the disc itself for this reissue says \"Duke Ellington MEETS Count Basie\" which makes no sense because they had known each other since the 20's. If you already like both orchestras, you'll want to own this late career session. If you want an introduction to each group in its waning years,  the CD serves nicely for that, too. This disc really jives, so don't be expecting any ballads here.","classification":5,"fold":4}

That's when other trance or electronica like \"Rhthym is a dancer\" and \"This is the rhythm of the night\"  and way later the group The Real McCoy with \"Runaway.\"  I guess trance really started hitting the radio in the late 90's with songs like \"As the Rush comes,\" \"Will I\" and way later 4 Strings \"Turn it around.\"","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"Ohio may not be the name everyone thinks of when it comes to music, but the state had many notable acts to emerge. The long list of talent incudes funk bands Zapp, Slave and Ohio Players, R&B acts The Isley Brothers, The O'Jays and Levert. A couple of rock bands to emerge in recent years are the bands Nine Inch Nails and The Black Keys. However, when it comes to hip hop, there have been a few familiar names to emerge here and there. The list includes producer Hi-Tek, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, two-thirds of The Alkaholiks (Specifically E-Swift and Tash), Tanya Morgan members Donwill and Ilyas and recently, Stalley. He made his initial debut in 2008 with the mixtape \"Goin' Ape\", which was followed by another mixtape \"MadStalley The Autobiography\". In 2010, he found his way on Curren$y's \"Pilot Talk\", as well as Ski Beatz' solo debut \"24 Hour Karate School\". After the release of the sports-themed \"Lincoln Way Nights\", he received a call from an unlikely fan. Rapper Rick Ross was looking to add a few acts to his Maybach Music Group roster and he summoned Stalley to join the fold. Stalley accepted and released another mixtape- his first under Maybach Music- \"Savage Journey To The American Dream\".\n\nTo further his allegiance to Maybach Music Group, he appeared on all three of the label's compilations. In October 2014, he released his highly anticipated major-label debut \"Ohio\". Joining him for the album is \"Lincoln Way Nights\" producer Rashad Thomas- who handles the bulk of \"Ohio\". As evidenced by the album's title and cover, \"Ohio\" is largely centered around two things: Pride for his home state (See the opening track \"Welcome To O.H.I.O.\" and the tribute to the women in his hometown \"330\") and cars (See the first single, the carjacking themed \"Jackin' Chevys\", \"Chevelle\" and \"System On Loud\"). Another song on the album \"Boomin'\" is a rewrite\/update of Memphis rapper Kingpin Skinny Pimp's 1996 single \"Boomin' In The Projects\"- complete with a sample of \"Teach Me How\" from under the radar Columbus, Ohio 70's band Wee. The track \"Problems\" sees Stalley address the issue of dealing with poverty and the eventual descent into criminal activity. He collaborates with label boss Rick Ross and The Dream protege August Alsina on the party themed \"One More Shot\", as well as Ty Dolla Sign on the N.W.A. referencing \"Always Into Something\". He also duets with West Coast rapper Nipsey Hustle on \"What It Be Like\" and closes the album with the seven minute \"Navajo Rugs\", which features an appearance from legendary hip hop trio De La Soul. \"Ohio\" is a great recording from Stalley. Though the album is skewered towards commercial appeal, in the end it's a worthy listen from one of the most promising talents in recent years.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"I think I'm in love with this song.  It has just continued to grow and grow on me to the point where I consider it a marvelous folk contribution to modern music.  The lyrical content, fresh and exciting and provoking, meshes beautifully with the simplistic guitar strums that only highlight to intimate nature of the track.  The sharp baritone vocals are powerful and yet they are blemished and so authentic.  This is like a southern rock take on Mumford and Sons, laying everything back with a more restrained approach to modern folk music.  When you close your eyes you can feel the wood planks under your feet and you can smell the rich smell of the bayou bringing you to a comfortable place that enriches its pain with the swells of home.\n\nLike I said, I'm in love.","classification":5,"fold":4}

Not me, but I am glad they are.\n\nDisappearing in Airports is a fantastic record from start to finish. Kevin Martin sounds amazing and his lyrics are the best I've heard from anyone in years. My favorite tracks are; Only Because of You, Vexations, Supernova, Alive at Last, I've Got a Gun, I Want it Back.\n\nNot a bad tune on here.\n\nIf you liked their debut record, you will enjoy this one, as well.\n\nAlso, I only found out about this album thanks to Amazon Prime. I couldn't stop listening to it. As soon as I had the cash, i ordered a copy to blast in my van. So, thank you Amazon Prime!\n\nI give Disappearing in Airports 5 stars!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida by Iron Butterfly is one of those old war horses from the psychedelic era that rambles on for 17 plus minutes and was deemed deep and mind expanding at the time. Its the kind of song that punk rockers looked to stick a safety pin through to burst the 60s love and peace idealism. Looking back on the song with the space of almost a half-century, it is over indulgant, about 10 minutes too long, but that propulsive beat will still cause you to knod your head in rhythm. Its the thump of the beat coupled with the chilling eeriness of the organ and sting of the guitar that makes you forgot the endless noodling that goes on for the middle 13 or so minutes that threaten to sink the song.","classification":4,"fold":4}

Sadly, instead of taking her time and finding the right notes, she has rushed herself into making another mediocre set of songs with Talk That Talk, and her latest single Where Have You Been, hasn't really been as driven or inspiring as she could've made it out to be in her voice.

Some were so blatantly similar I almost considered them a sample, but the liner notes didn't give credits to any song samples.  There were very few melodies that were truly noteworthy, but otherwise it was a tedious listen.\n\nI think the main problem with this recording is it doesn't know what it wants to be or should be.  It doesn't really tell a story, it's not a rock opera, it's not two CDs chock full of various songs, it's not really anything...but many minutes of generalized music.

{"text":"The pointblank outpouring of the feminine soul - in a state of anguish & mourning - receives its full measure in this exceptional classic \"Un-break My Heart\"; sung with truly unique voice inflections & intonations by Toni Braxton; composed & written by Diane Eve Warren. We hear our heroine pleading for and commanding her deceased or departed lover to return to her immediately to assauge her loss and hurt, \"Don't leave me in all this pain, Don't leave me out in the rain...\" The use of the imperative is so forceful and direct, it heightens the impact of the song, and renders us as wrung out with catharsis - as she is.\n\nBraxton's soft, silky utterances easily immerse the listener in the strength and power of her heavier vocal chords - when she pours it on, \"Say you'll love me again, Undo this hurt you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life; Un-cry these tears, I cried so many nights...Un-break my heart!\" The excellent video for this song with its dramatic intensity lifts this rendition into being scene- and plot-driven, like \"Mourning Becomes Electra\" with the lights turned down.\n\nThis in turn builds plot and 'grief' motif within 'surround sound' orchestration. Braxton's intensity, her passionate request for her lover to return - becomes one of the more powerful crescendos in pop music. This would not be so - if her lips were sealed - they had to be un-sealed - her depth of expression from deep within her soul - may cause us to grieve (our catharsis, her purge of emotion). We listen to her final refrain and empathize with her loss. It is quite satisfying if not exhausting. We hope to be drenched in her emotional denouement upon re-playing this cinematic song. It is yours to enjoy when the mood is right.\n\n\"Bring back the nights when I held you beside me\nUn-break my heart\nSay you'll love me again\nUndo this hurt you caused\nWhen you walked out the door\nAnd walked out of my life\nUn-cry this tears\nI cried so many, many nights\nUn-break my\nUn-break my heart oh baby\nCome back and say you love me\nUn-break my heart\nSweet darlin'\nWithout you I just can't go on\nCan't go on....\"","classification":5,"fold":4}

But honestly, it takes a certain magic to absolutely ignite it from the heart, and make it all worth the effort, the patience, and the heart. For Elton John, he has honestly withstood the test of time in his music and with Bernie Taupin's lyrics, their songs have honestly been the greatest second-coming after The Beatles, with heart, voice, head and heart from time. For George Michael, he has done several of Elton and Bernie's songs live for years, from Tonight for the Two Rooms album in 1991, to Idol off of his Symphonica live album, but out of all of them, the most significant that still delivers all of this time is Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me, which was done as a charity singer in regards to AIDS, which both of them suffered a magnificent loss with Freddie Mercury of Queen, losing his life in 1991.

{"text":"Remember how exciting it was the first time you heard \"Wicked Game\"? That isn't likely to happen when listening to this album. It's not to say this isn't a good release, but, like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, it sure feels like I've been here a few times before.  Isaak is blessed with a fine voice and he can general work his way around a solid hook. Almost all of the tracks on this effort salute many of Isaak's early rock heroes (Elvis & Orbison & Jerry Lee), and a tip of the hat to contemporaries such as the Mavericks \/ Raul Malo \/ Traveling Wilburys. The ill-titled 'Insects' was really the least appealing track to these ears, but most-all the other cuts hit the mark in a familiar way. Isaak can be humorous, as he he on the name-dropping, \"Down In Flames\", where one can almost envision The King up on stage in one of those ridiculous 60's film sets when Presley would grab a guitar in the middle of a scene and rip into song. \"Baby, What You Want Me To Do\" is campy for all the reasons that made Tom Jones or even Cher songs cringe-worthy at times.\n.\nAmong the high lights are songs where Isaak sounds the most like Isaak. The opening, title track is strong. \"Dry Your Eyes\" has some terrific guitar licks, presumably from guitarist Hershel Yatovitz? Ubiquous singer\/songwriter, Michelle Branch lends her writing talents and backing vocals to \"Reverie\". The best song, IMO, was the 5:18 guitar driven gem, \"Please Don't Call\". It rumbles down the road at a nice clip, not unlike Hal Ketchum's chugging classic, \"Point of Rescue\". I found it easily the strongest track on this record and up there with early Chris classics as \"Dancin\" & \"Gone Ridin\". Brilliant and refreshing.\n.\n\"First Comes the Night\" is a fine addition to the Chris Isaak library. It's not unusual for him to stick to what has taken him this far.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"Paramore has been going through some rough times lately. After pulling things together for 'brand new eyes', arguably their best effort to date, the two Farro brothers broke away from the band, leaving lead singer Hayley Williams with the two remaining members. They blamed their departure on the red-head's self-centered ways, and maybe they were correct. A lot of fans wondered whether or not the band would ever be the same.\n\nIt is safe to say that not much is missed without the Farro brothers. This comes as a shock, considering that the chief songwriter is gone, but with lyrics such as 'call me a traitor, I'm just collecting your victims', it doesn't seem as though he is needed any longer. The sound of the band remains moderately unchanged, though this song is a bit heavier than their older material. However, considering the subject matter, it's likely less due to the switch-up in members and more due to the topic at hand.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Paramore's next full-length effort will provide the same affecting ruminations and catchy rhythms as their first trio of releases. However, with Hayley's respectably talented pipes and the group's remaining knack for confessional songcraft, so far it sounds like nothing has really changed at all, which is all for the better.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"This is the first of four collaborations between Peterson and Jackson and it presages the ones to come. At a few seconds short of forty one minutes this album is almost a tease.\n\nOne of the nice things about this album is it has some of the restraint Jackson used with the Modern Jazz Quartet. However, Peterson's piano is a major contrast to John Lewis' of the MJQ and that contrast makes this album interesting. For one thing, Peterson and bassist Ray Brown were renown for intensity even on ballads, and drummer Ed Thigpen fit right into that as well.\n\nDespite my alluding to intensity, the music comes across as relaxed and laid back. They made it sound so easy! When you closely listen the intensity is there under a layer of virtuosity and musicality. This is Jackson and Peterson's trio at their finest in my opinion.\n\nSince there is no track list (as I write this) I am providing one for reference:\n1. On Green Dolphin Street 7:32\n2. Heartstrings  5:43\n3. Work Song 7:35\n4. John Brown's Body 7:49\n 5. A Wonderful Guy 4:57\n 6. Reunion Blues\n\nThe album was recorded for Verve in NYC over the course of two sessions (September 15 and 18, 1961.)  Sadly there were five unissued tracks from the sessions, two of which are logged as 'untitled Peterson originals' that I would have loved to have been included in a reissue. Regardless, the music that is on this album is definitely worthwhile.","classification":5,"fold":4}

However, Traci's vocals were auto-tuned during parts of the song.\n\nIf you listen to the rest of the album, she clearly doesn't need auto-tune. So Whoever's bright idea it was to auto-tune her vocals on this track - basically ruins the song.\n\nOn top of that, the song feels rushed. on Braxton Family Values, the show showed Traci recording this song and she kept yelling cut and doing several takes.\n\nIt's like as if the producers of the song didn't even give her a chance to do it right. it's like as if they said \"Screw it, we'll auto-tune you on this track.\"\n\nLike I said, Lyrically, it's a good song but production and vocal wise, it could have been better","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"On their second album the Australian psychedelic rock revivalists Tame Impala hit the bullseye yet again. Their last album \"Innerspeaker\" purloined the heart of many discerning rock fans not least with its trippy songs of loneliness which often recalled late period Beatles and was delightfully produced by The Flaming Lips soundboard guru Dave Fridmann. On this new album \"Lonerism\" a sense of isolation is once again the overriding theme but it is masked by the sheer variety of shade, colour and verve contained in these twelve songs. The bands unique leader Kevin Parker seeks his inspiration from polar opposite ends of the musical spectrum namely Britney Spears' `plastic pop' and predominantly from the well head of that \"Wizard and true star\" the gargantuanly talented but often sadly overlooked Todd Rundgren. It is difficult to know quite where to commence here since you sense that those who were smitten with the blissful \"Innerspeaker\" may find the sheer levels of experimentation here somewhat grating and overbearing. Alternatively if you give it sufficient time you will detect a wayward relative, an enfant terrible who clearly is part of the same close knit family but growing up at an astounding rate.\n\nJust listen to the first three songs and wonder about the fact that many of the the newer bands who have released albums in 2012 struggle to capture this level of creativity and innovation on an extended canvass of 45 minutes plus. Opener \"Be above it\" is all vocal loops and probably the most insistant drumming since Underworld's anthem \"Born Slippy\". Next in line \"Endor Toi\" achieves what Yeasayer have miserably failed to do on their new album by creating huge whirlwinds of pop psychedelica within the framework of a beautiful melodies, whilst \"Apocalypse Dreams\" is as a funky as anything on Lewis Taylor's \"Lost Album\" and as equally brilliant. Timing is everything and on the same day that ELO issue a new greatest hits \"Why won't they talk me \" echoes Jeff Lynne while \"Feel like we are going backwards\" is pure summer of love and blissed out vibes. Mention in dispatches should go to the wonderful pop of the single \"Elephant\" a sprawlingly ambitious song which throws in the kitchen sink, the the gas cooker and the microwave. It is far the most rocking track on the album but pumps along with enough distractions to grab your attention with a vice like grip. God knows what is going on all together in the six minute plus \"Nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control\" punctuated by whirring Parker vocals, spoken dialogue and almost a Syd Barrett like pop longing which makes it such a unmitigated treat. In this sense the last song \"Sun's Coming Up\" might be the least favourite track on here starting with a gentle piano coda and ending with synthesiser waves crashing on the beach it might just be a bit to clever for its own good but more listens are required. In any case you can counter it with one of the bubbling highlights of the album the echo laden and spacey \"Music to walk home by\" a song to wear your needle thin.\n\nTame Impala and their burgeoning levels of \"Mind Mischief\" are turning this band into real contenders with their massive pop sensibilities combined with an eye for startling retro, so old its new. This is an album realised well in time for the forthcoming brightness of the Australian summer and no doubt will soundtrack the rising heat in those latitudes as the a hot sun slowly drifts down the line of beach. In the grey autumn of a dull October how we must envy our \"Antipodean\" cousins for their fair climate and for having one of the best new bands on any continent.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Nirvana would go on to be huge international rock stars after the release of their second album \"Nevermind\", the album was much more pop oriented then their previous release \"Bleach\". Kurt Cobain had a knack for writing catchy pop tunes that would stick in the listener's head. This cannot be labeled a true grunge album along the lines of Mudhoney and the Melvins, but it's catchy and crossed over into the mainstream. \"Nevermind\" topped Garth Brooks, C&C Music factory, and Michael Jackson, which was big news back in 1991. A small punk band from Aberdeen became the biggest rock stars almost overnight, creating an almost unwanted fame that would ultimately be the demise of the band. If you are looking for a grunge album , you should pick up their last release \"In Utero\" which is much more raw.  \"Nevermind\" will stand the test of time because it's just a great rock record, plus it's catchy as hell.  All the hits were on this album, so buy and you want be disappointed.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Probably the most popular and certainly the most well known song by one of the greatest rock groups from the '60s. If ever there was a song that helped define the mood and feelings for baby boomers during the mid to late '60s you could make a good case for The Doors \"Light My Fire\". Approximately 6:30 minutes in length it broke the conventional rule of radio that a song couldn't or at least shouldn't be more then three minutes long. But the song would get plenty of air play. With its psychodellic tone and mesmerizing organ solo and of course Jim Morrison's voice it is easy to see once you combine all these elements together why this is such an outstanding recording. If you are a child of the 1960s this is a must to down load on your MP3 player.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"So, with more than a few variations of this LP, how do you write a proper review???\nWell, lets start with the US version. I've had three different versions of the \"Red & Blue\" albums, A later 80's pressing on the Red Capitol Label, The Original Red and Blue colored Vinyl US issues, also with Capitol Labels and the \"C1\" issues on the \"small\" Capitol label-and those issues are very limited pressings as the record companies were already starting to ditch vinyl as a popular format. The Blue colored edition looks beautiful, but it sounds just average for sound fidelity. The UK Blue vinyl edition sounds much better and the UK mixes, which in 73 were superior to the Capitol mixes, were used. The nice thing about the US edition is some of the US mixes, even thought their not as 'clean' as the British mixes, sonically I like them better. Songs like 'She's A Woman', 'I Feel Fine' sound more fuller and richer with the added reverb to my ears. And 'Help' is preceded by the James Bond Theme as found only on the US mix, and it fits perfectly. All in all great music!\nGerard Masters","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"The Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir is back with it's latest offering, \"I'll Say Yes\". TBT is still doing what it does best. That is giving us messages from the heart that inspire us to press on and not to grow weary of doing good. Put God first and then everything else will fall into line. The TBT choir does not \"perform\" but rather, it ministers to those who need to be encouraged during these days of trials and tribulations. On this album you will find sweet ballads and soul stirring anthems to lift your spirit. I never lost my praise is the track that comes to mind. It speaks of giving God the praise even in the dark times because He always comes through for you. It encourages you to not let the world steal your joy and rob you of the praises that you should offer up daily. I believe you will be truly blessed by this album and I encourage you to purchase additional copies for those who would benefit from a spiritual lift. Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":4}

And with Whitney Houston gone far too young, and our knowledge of the personal struggles that were brewing at the time this tune was released, the pathos of this song augments its power even more. From its a cappella opening to the pained warbling of its crescendo, to its mournful sax: this is the one Whitney Houston song to have when you can have only one.\n\nIf you want to listen to Whitney Houston with a smile, consider&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/I-Wanna-Dance-With-Somebody\/dp\/B00137T4WE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">I Wanna Dance With Somebody<\/a>&nbsp;instead.

{"text":"For the past few years, Gregory Alan Isakov has been making welcome appearances on my Pandora stations. His songs are pleasant, melodic, sad. They make for good, almost sleepy background listening. They are as pleasant as anything you will find on the market, but my criticism is that except for a couple of songs (\"Master & A Hound\", and maybe \"The Moon Song\") they aren't much more than pleasant. They don't make me want to put down what I'm doing. They don't make me want to close my eyes. They are just Pleasant.\n\nThe songs' emotion feels real but restrained. In most songs, he sounds like he's singing out of the back of his throat, with his mouth barely open. I haven't seen him sing, but I suspect that he rarely opens his mouth wide enough to see his teeth. He sounds restrained, hesitant, unwilling to quite come out.\n\nWith that said, Isakov has shown flashes. Master & A Hound is much better than pleasant, but still has a frustrating current of restraint. The guy is a brick wall away from being really good.","classification":3,"fold":4}

After the souful success of No One from As I Am, her fourth album, she shows absolutely no signs of ending her reign in R&B. Her latest single, Like You'll Never See Me Again, the second single from that album shows a softer side from her voice that remains strong from the soul, and still shows a pitch in her voice that has grown with her style in writing. I really think this one follows the way No One helped make As I Am shine. This track works better than anything from wannabe artists like Fantasia or Jordan Sparks. I definitely know Alicia really will make her next single just as good as this one.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"My title is kind of blunt isn't it?  However, the bottom line is that Arc Of A Diver is one medicore recording loaded with excessive synthesizer tones and lacking much in the order of good melodies.\nThe first two songs are clearly the cream of this crop.  I will even say that While You See A Chance is one of Steve Windwood's best songs of all time.  The words are quite soothing and the melody is extremely captivating.  The instrumental accompanyment is very appropriate.  Also, the very next track, Arc Of A Diver, is quite ear friendly with a strong melody and good special effects.\nAfter this strong opening, the rest of the record is quite dissappointing.  The remaining songs tend to drag within a few minutes.  Several of these so-called tunes even exceede the six minute mark in length with barely a distinguishable melody.  Guitars, natural sounding keyboards, and a driving drumbeat are almost non-existent.\nDear Listener, you are best served to pursue Steve Windwood's Traffic career.  These tunes feature some good instrumental definition and some compelling melodies.  Stevie's Back In The High Life is a considerable better effort as many of the tunes on that release are quite stylish.  On this record, you have the great two song opener, two more passable tunes(Spanish Dancer, Night Train) and an overabundance of synthesizer drivel that at least to my ears is not worth the investment.","classification":2,"fold":4}

{"text":"You know how artists try to relive the 60s soul glory days by releasing covers that sound just like the classics? Well, Sharon Jones relives it by actually trying to compete with the classics. That's right, they use instruments from the time period, they have the same sound, and they have an ultra-soulful singer, but Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings is all original material. That's right, they have the sound of the Philly & Motown sound circa 1969, and they wrote all the music themselves in 2010. Now this, you gotta hear.\n\nNote: This is the first time I've ever heard of this group or their work, but I do know this is their fourth album.\n\nHighlights Include:\nI Learned The Hard Way\nBetter Things\nMoney\nThe Reason\n\nUnlike many other bands that try to achieve a retro sound, Sharon & the Kings have a real passion for the music, and instead of being chained by the tradition of the sound, they get in the mindset and get in line with the tradition, because they would have done it whether it was tradition or brand new. In fact, the most original thing about this album & group is the fact that it is currently 2010. Still, it's that passion that makes the album & the group so charming. It's that passion that's given them they're loyal followers, and it's that passion that would make them a hit even with they weren't from the 21st Century.\n\nOverall, for anybody that likes this style of music, likes to go retro every once in a while, or just wants an original group, look no further than Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings. In the world of retro 60s soul they not only act out the part well, but they're not acting.\n\nReal Score: 4.5","classification":5,"fold":4}

Her winning streak continued throughout the rest of the 60's with major hits including ''Wishin' and Hopin' '' (1964), and ''The Look of Love'' (1967), both written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, the team that supplied Dionne Warwick with most of her early hits. Of course everyone recalls her signature tune, the haunting \"You Don't Have To Say You Love Me\" from the summer of 1966.\n\nIn 1968 Dusty Springfield decided that it was time to shift gears. She made the decision to leave the comfortable confines of Philips records and signed a new deal with Atlantic. Now Dusty had always been a huge fan of all of those great black singers from the early 1960's and longed to record that kind of music. Her debut album for Atlantic was \"Dusty In Memphis\" which is considered to be a classic. The debut single from that LP was a tune that Aretha Franklin had inexplicably rejected. \"Son Of A Preacher Man\" would go on to become a Top Ten hit in both the U.S. and in England. This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Clipse, the dynamic duo from Virginia, return for the third time with Til The Casket Drops.  However, unfortunately for them, the third time isn't the charm.\n\nAlthough Clipse created crazy anticipation for Til The Casket Drops with absolutely excellent singles such as I'm Good and it's remix ft. Rick Ross (mysteriously missing from the release) as well as Kinda Like A Big Deal ft. Kanye West, the album ultimately falls flat.  Malice & Pusha T are still as potent as ever behind the mic with many quotables, but it is the production (DJ Khalil, Sean C, Neptunes) that surprisingly fails to keep up with their sharp wit and flows.\n\nThe album starts out sizzling with 5 straight bangers in Freedom, Popular Demand, Showing Out, I'm Good, and Kinda Like A Big Deal.  However from that point on the album fizzles fast.  There Was A Murder, Never Will It Stop and All Eyes On Me are just simply too wack to listen to.  Counseling is decent at best.  Those 4 songs (on a 13 track album) disrupt the flow of the album and make it feel uneven and thrown together.  To make it worse is that they are all grouped together with only DOORMAN to save the mediocrity of the middle of the album.  The album ends strongly with Footsteps, Life Change, and Champion.\n\nTil The Casket Drops is quite an underwhelming cd.  I wouldn't go as far as to call it a disappointment because there are a couple bonafide bangers.  It's a good album just not the album people were expecting especially after Hell Hath No Fury and Lord Willin.  If you're a fan of the Clipse I would still recommend this album as you could find value in some of the weakest songs, however casual fans are advised to take a listen first.  3.5 stars.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"At last, the long awaited debut by \"Dreamgirl\" Jennifer Hudson arrives and for the most part, it delivers. Featuring a plethora of songwriters and producers, like lots of R&B albums, it is ballad heavy but saved by her powerful voice.\n\nOpening the CD is lead-off single \"Spotlight\", an uptempo dance number similar to Ne-Yo's \"Closer\". Like that hit, this was penned by Ne-Yo and produced by him and Stargate, hence the similarity.\n\nTimbaland provides the skeletal \"Pocketbook\" (featuring Ludacris providing a rather saucy rap) which finds Jennifer backed solely by harmonies, piano, and a human beat box. Different and nice. \"What's wrong (go away)\" features T-Pain adding his autotuned vocals to a lovely duet (I like the note they both hit at the end).\n\nOther standouts are \"My heart\" (with delicately tinkling piano in the background), the \"You make me feel like a natural woman\" channelling \"I'm his only woman\" which features Fantasia (it starts off building up to a catfight, before both ladies agree they are being played by the same guy), the lovely acoustic ballad \"Can't stop the rain\" (another Stargate\/Ne-Yo production - a tale of heartbreak after a car crash), the power ballad \"Invisible\", and the Gospel organ-driven hymn \"Jesus promised me a home over there\".\n\nI have to confess, she doesn't really get to flex her vocal chops on any of the songs, except on the included \"Dreamgirls\" performance \"And I'm telling you I'm not going\". Also included is her retro soul track \"All dressed up in love\" from the \"Sex & the city\" soundtrack.\n\nIt does take a few spins to appreciate and while not outstanding, it's a nice introduction to Ms Hudson.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"This is a very nice song. The melody and how every thing comes together was done very well. Nelly's voice is crystal clear. This song should have been longer with some sort of instrumental solo in the middle and at the end fading away slowly in conjunction with the other instruments. None the less I like this type of song from Nelly. I've been a fan off Nelly since she started in the late 90's. I was in high school and normally listened to rock music like Guns N' Roses, Metalica, Aerosmith, Pink Floyd etc. I hated when she changed to more \"dirty\" type music. But she had to grow up and wish she would make more of this types of songs. This is more classy Nelly and I like a well orchestrate song with melodies. U need to listen very carefully to the song with your headphones to appreciate not just the lyrics, but the instruments and how they were tied together. GOOD MUSIC!","classification":5,"fold":4}

That is definitely the case with the song Diane Warrne penned for her, Spanish Guitar. The song is absolutely very bold and brilliant from what the song captures through Toni's voice, and is honestly one of my favorites from Toni top to bottom. While people will always go back into Diane's other big one from Toni, Un-Break My Heart, this song is definitely worth a deep listen from the seductive soul. Tell you the truth, the song was originally written for Celine Dion, but a good thing she passed it up. While many people overshadowed Pulse, this pulse of a intimate guitar is the best from Toni's heat anyday.\n\nSong: A 1\/2-","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Starting to love this album, it's really starting to grow on me the more I listen to it. But I do miss the heaviest of past albums like Guitar Gangsters and Cadillac Blood, Rock the rebel\/ metal the devil, and the Strenght\/the sound\/ the songs. But like any awesome band they new to grow with each release. They has starting to change with each release starting with Beyond hell\/ above heaven and continue with Outlaw gentlemen shady ladies which I think this album sounds a lot like. The album starts off with the catchy single The Devils Bleeding Crown. Sounding like a really catchy Metallica song from load or reload with a more modern sound and Glen Danzig singing over it with more melody. Some of the rhythms almost sound like Cape Of our Hero from their previous album. The second track Marie Laveau rocks a little harder but doesn't turn into a full on thrash metal tune like you would expect. All the songs sort have the same vibe and rhythm. Most of the album just reminds a lot of Outlaw Gentlemen and Shady Ladies. Like these songs could almost be outtakes or b-sides from that album that's how similar they sound to that album. All the songs have sort of a 90s era Metallica vibe about them. Like a mixture of the Black album, Load and Reload mixed the Misfits and a dash of southern rock. Probably the heaviest song on the album is the last song track 13 The Loa's Crossroad. A sort of medium paced thrasher with a bagpipe solo in the middle. Volbeat on this release do two covers one of a band I've never heard of called Rebound by a band called Teenage Bottle Rocket. The second cover they do a song called Battleship by the Geogria Satellites. A guest appearance by Danko Jones on the song Black Rose. But all in all this is a solid album. Volbeat seem to inject more melody into their brand of Rockabilly heavy metal that seems to really work. Maybe the only downfall on this album is it sounds to similar to Outlaw Gentlemen and Shady Ladies. Maybe not for the die hard metal heads that prefer their old stuff. But I enjoyed it all the same banjo and bagpipe solos in all.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Excellent followup for Robert Randolph and the Family Band's underground classic \"Live at the Wetlands.\" Those who liked that CD will be pleased with this one. Most of this consists of tunes that this excellent group has been performing live over the last year, like \"Run For Your Life,\" \"Good Times,\" and \"Squeeze.\" Once again, John Ginty plays the heck out of his organ and Marcus Randolph and Danyel Morgan in fine support (though it would be nice if this one had more of Danyel's soaring vocals).\nOverall, this is good stuff, particularly the songs that I have just mentioned. Real get-up and go music with a positive energy not often found in tunes of recent times. \"Soul Refershing\" is simply beautiful and \"Smile\" is interesting (Robert's sister Lenesha does the vocals here). \"Calypso\" (not to be confused with the Harry belafonte tune of the same name) is an interesting novelty. A few of the songs (like \"I Need More Love\") are somewhat lacking in the right mix of melody and energy that characteris\\zes this group-but a so-so song from these guys are better than the best of a lot of what's out there now!\nI would suggest that those who may be interested in this start with \"Live at the Wetlands\" before going on to \"Unclassified.\" That will give you a better preperation for this. Then pick up \"The Word\" (RR without the Family Band) and the \"Sacred Steel\" Cds after you listen to \"Unclassified.\" Then see these guys live and  you will have hope for the future of American popular music.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"This is most definitely NOT \"Hot Fuss 2.\" The Killers take their rep as last year's model and climb into a Pink Cadillac, which they floor the accelerator and beat a retreat from the glitz that one would associate with their home digs of Las Vegas and start screaming down the boulevard toward the East Coast and the Jersey Shore. Gone is most of the breezy 80's New Wave giddiness and in its place is....Bon Jovi's New Jersey? Yes, I have read the interviews where the ever cocky Brandon Flowers declares his newly discovered love for Bruce Springsteen, but frankly he is not anywhere close to that level of artistic acumen. So rather than get a five star extravaganza like \"Born In The USA,\" we get The Killers' approximation of \"Slippery When Wet.\"\n\nThis is not a bad thing. It is obvious to me that The Killers are expanding their reach and desires. There are a couple moments of brilliance on \"Sam's Town,\" like the (excuse the pun) killer lead single \"When You Were Young.\" The band brings the urgency of the \"Hot Fuss\" singles to lyrics that match up to their new found appreciation for Springsteen and make the jump from good songs to great songs. Same with \"Bones,\" a good song that gets extra cinematic punch from an Asbury Jukes styled horn chart, again making the leap to greatness.\n\nBut there are also moments where the reach exceeds the grasp. The \"Exitude\" and \"Enterlude\" bits are kind of silly. There are moments - like on \"This River Is Wide\" - when it sounds like Flowers is singing beyond his range. \"Sam's Town\" also hits the occasional lyrical snag, like on \"Bling (Confessions Of A King),\" where someone should have told the band that \"I awoke on the roadside in the land of the free ride\" would be considered third rate lyrics even for Bon Jovi. (Even if the song has an unbeatable hook.) Aside from that minor glitch, \"Sam's Town\" comes crammed with the kind of American Character songs that populate the Springsteen\/Mellencamp universe of cars and seekers, like \"Uncle Jonny\" and the title track.\n\nOverall, The Killers' sophomore effort is more hit than miss. And I am willing to give them the benefit of a bonus half\/star just on the fact that they were unwilling to coast on their triple platinum laurels and challenge themselves. They may not be up to their \"Born To Run\" yet, but at least they didn't cut a \"Fairweather Johnson.\"","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"In early 2004, I remember first hearing \"Somebody Told Me\" followed quickly by \"Mr. Brightside\". I bought \"Hot Fuss\" and thought at that time how well the band reminded me of the best of the 1980's New Wave movement that I grew up on as an impressionable kid. I always felt that \"Hot Fuss\" didn't get enough airplay. There were so many good songs, memorable songs, that didn't get their fair shot at top 40 radio back then. I was hooked, and I've bought every Killers release as well as both of Brandon Flowers' albums.\n\nPersonally, I feel that, unlike, say, Phil Collins, or Peter Cetera, Brandon Flowers is better suited to The Killers than he is as a solo artist. With one caveat: Phil Collins' first two solo projects, 1981's \"Face Value\" and 1982's \"Hello, I Must Be Going\" are not his best works. They have some really great songs, but they are not, as a whole experience, his best albums. Brandon Flowers, thus far, is more like David Lee Roth, or Mark Knopfler--solid, but just missing what they had in their own respective bands. So, here is Brandon Flowers' second solo album \"The Desired Effect\" which, right out of the gate, received critical accolades. I'm not so sure about that, as there are some songs here that begin to annoy after repeated listens. My biggest annoyance\/beef is with \"I Can Change\". There was absolutely no reason to use Bronski Beat's 1984 gay independence anthem \"Smalltown Boy\" on a song like \"I Can Change\" which is the exact opposite of being who you are, and instead trying to be what you think someone else wants you to be. Irritating, especially upon repeated listens. Next up on the annoyance scale is \"Diggin' Up The Heart\". At first, I thought why does this song sound so familiar, and then it came to me--it is a dead ringer for the Electric Light Orchestra's 1983 hit \"Rock And Roll Is King\". Irritating upon repeated listens, too. The other two tracks that are bothersome after awhile are \"Untangled Love\" and \"Still Want You\".\n\nThe best tracks here are \"Dreams Come True\", \"Between Me And You\", \"Never Get You Right\" and \"The Way It's Always Been\". These four tracks strike the range of emotions, are well written, and have the best melodies here. Special mention goes to \"Can't Deny My Love\" and \"Lonely Town\".\n\nSo, slightly more than half the songs here are strong, with about four that aren't. But, overall, I liked the album. It grew on me. At first I wasn't sure, especially since I had just listened to all of The Killers and Brandon's solo debut. There is an element to Flowers that screams I want to be king of the world. I feel he tries to swing for home runs every time he makes music, and I still don't feel he's an entirely original artist. He is still heavily copying what has come before without doing something new with it. I can't recommend producers because he's already worked with quite a few I would suggest. Time will tell if solo Flowers' material will hit the big time or not, but I guarantee that \"The Desired Effect\" isn't it.\n\nHere's how \"The Desired Effect\" compares to Flowers' previous work:\n\nThe Killers:\n2004 Hot Fuss: Four Stars\n2006 Sam's Town: Three and a Half Stars\n2008 Day & Age: Three and a Half Stars\n2012 Battle Born: Four Stars\n\nBrandon Flowers:\n2010 Flamingo: Three Stars\n2015 The Desired Effect: Three and a Half Stars","classification":4,"fold":4}

This is an album of nothing but hero tracks. Every single one feels like the main theme for some epic story. For me it's a bonus that this isn't actually a soundtrack because it allows me to imagine this epic story for myself from scratch.\n\nEpic and inspiring!","classification":5,"fold":4}

So, do I care about the music or some decals, a poster and a couple of fanzines?  Take a guess!  So, essentially, if I want the 3 CDs of demos, 'rarities' and B-sides and the DVD, I am supposed to pay an additional $135 above for what I can get the remastered 5 studio albums?  I don't think so!  I don't need a 'cool box' and some miscellaneous crap that I will save until . . . . until I decide it's nothing but crap and throw it out.

{"text":"I think this is a lovely album. It's not a ground-breaking classic like Dark Side Of The Moon, Meddle or The Wall, say, (although there are musical references to all of them) nor does it have individual songs of the brilliance and beauty of Wish You Were Here or Shine On You Crazy Diamond, but in total it is a fine album with some genuinely beautiful music on it.\n\nPut together from off-cuts from The Division Bell and then heavily re-worked and edited, this has been billed as a tribute to the late Rick Wright - and it's s fine tribute. There is plenty of his trademark keyboard sound, along with a lot of truly fabulous guitar work from David Gilmour. He's a great guitarist and there are very few people who can bring that degree of beauty and aching melancholy from the instrument. He's on fine form here, as is Nick Mason whose drumming perhaps doesn't get the recognition it deserves in creating the Floyd sound.\n\nThis is almost an ambient album in many ways, although there's more to it than that. There is an unbroken sequence of fairly brief tracks which are varied but hold together well as a unit. There are almost no vocals, just Steven Hawking speaking on Talkin' Hawkin' and a genuine song in the last track, Louder Than Words. Both are about the importance of settling disputes through talking and, appropriately, it is here that the absence of Roger Waters as a songwriter shows most clearly, because for me neither the melody nor lyrics are up to Waters' standard. It's a tiny blemish - not even a blemish at all, really, just a reminder - and the album as a whole is really good, I think.\n\nThis won't convert you if you don't like Pink Floyd, but if you do I think you'll really like this album. It's lovely music, beautifully played and produced, and I recommend it warmly.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Mixed emotions on this one.  Some of the best performances were also in the \"Big Violin Box\". e.g., the Suk recordings of the Mozart Concertos ##2 & 3. the Oistrakh recording of the Dvorak and the Elman recordings of the Lalo Symphonie espagnole (4 movement version).  That also has some of the Szigeti\/Arrau Beethoven Sonatas (##6, 7 & 8) and excellent recordings of the Franck Sonata and Beethoven's \"Kreutzer\" by Oistrakh, as well as a number of encores performed by Oistrakh and by Elman.  This does have a very fine recording of the Glazunov Concerto with Oistrakh , a good (if old-fashioned) Elman recording of a Bach Concerto and very fine (and comparatively modern) recordings of the Bruch Concerto #1 and his Scottish Fantasy.  On the other hand...\n\nThe Joseph Silverstein recordings of the Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky and Mozart #5 are, to put it mildly, disappointing.  There's just nothing very distinctive here.  There is no \"personality and he often seems rather tentative.  The Tchaikovsky is played with the cuts restored but some of these are rather repetitive passages sound even more forced and repetitive than normal here.  The orchestral contributions (Utah Symphony under various un-named conductors, except for the Mozart, which has the Rochester Philharmonic) add little.  The sound (probably from the 1980s) has less presence than many RCA recordings from the 1950s.  If you don't have the Big Violin Box and\/or have an interest in the Glazunov and Bruch, it's worth it but otherwise, consider carefully.  If these would be your only recordings of the Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn and Tchaikovsky, you're cheating yourself.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"I suppose that a number of my contemporaries will be snickering when they read this. After all, in the mid to late 1970's no one was considered less cool and more irrelevant than Barry Manilow. His records were played on the radio ad nauseam and lots of \"sophisticated\" people dismissed his music as trite. But the fact of the matter is that Barry Manilow and his producer Ron Dante made some of the most enduring pop records of the last 40 years.  Now I must confess that I do like quite a few of Manilow's 1970's hits.  Among my favorites is a tune from the 1978 motion picture \"Foul Play\" starring Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase.  \"Ready To Take A Chance Again\" is a tune that most people can readily relate to.  Although it just missed cracking the Top Ten it was still a substantial hit in the autumn of 1978.  A terrific pop ballad.","classification":5,"fold":4}

It's much better to match those memories to the actual remembered version.\n\nSecond, this is the extended version. The usual, radio edit is 4:22 (as found on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mega-Hits-Dance-Classics-Vol-8\/dp\/B000006LRA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mega Hits Dance Classics, Vol. 8<\/a>, for example), but this is the full (12-inch?) length of 7:26. Disco songs were meant to roll along forever, just like that.\n\nAs I type, this version of Groove Line is also available in Amazon Prime Music, but I thought it was worth the bit of cash to be able to download the MP3 to use wherever I want.

{"text":"Over the years,I've found that the ubiquity of art can have totally random results on those appreciating it. In my particular case? This defines my history with Amy Winehouse. Before becoming too fully aware of her music? My head was mired in the misadventures of her final half decade of life. The drugs,the bad relationships? Heard it all before about many artists. It wasn't a way to present someone who clearly possessed an enormous talent. And really turned me off of giving her more of a listen. Now that so many years have passed? It seems easier to be able to appreciate her musical art,not get put off by the external drama surrounding it.\n\n  \"Rehab\" was the first song I ever heard by this artist,and it's a monster groove filled with hot horns,bell like percussion and hand claps all the way to it's now iconic chorus. \"You Know I'm No Good\" is a chunkier variation of that same sound while \"Me & Mr. Jones\" and \"\"Wake Up Alone\" are slow crawling,piano based shuffles. \"Just Friends\" spirals with a quirky,pressing rhythm while the title song bops along with it's melodic piano and drum rolls while \"Tears Dry On Their Own\" utilizes song structures from...a certain Ashford & Simpson written 60's hit duet. The album ends with the ballad \"Some Unholy War\" and the sunny sounding mid tempo \"He Can Only Hold Her\".\n\n  Overall this album is a musical about face from her debut. Vocally? Amy has changed up from an adventurous jazz oriented singer to one with a deeper,more gospel inflected soul shout. While many of her inflections remain totally intact? The music here provides an element that makes me wish I'd gotten into it a lot sooner than I actually did. Half of the album is produced by Mark Ronson. And the backup band on this are non other than the Dap Kings. Both of this musical entities have been vital in shaping an enormous funk\/soul revival during the 2010's. And while this album and it's retro soul format became much copied during it's time? It was just as influential by virtue of it's participants as it was for the main artist involved.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Most of the time when I buy a CD, I listen to it a few times and then put it back on the shelf for weeks or months at a time before I give it another listen. There are occasions, however, when I buy a CD and it really grabs a hold of me. On these rare occasions, I become engrossed, almost addicted to the album. Martha Wainwright's self-titled debut has been one of these occasions.\n\nBecause of who her family is, it would be easy to immediately dismiss her as \"the sister of Rufas,\" or \"the daughter of Louden and Kate McGarrigle.\" This would be a mistake, because Martha Wainwright's music is distinctly unique and she is a huge talent in her own right.\n\nHer voice is gorgeous, but not in a traditional sense. Her voice has a soulful, high-pitched, eerie beauty, like nothing I've ever heard before. In her delivery, there is a real sense of emotion and feeling that really connects with the listener. With most albums, when you are done listening, you are done. When you are finished with Martha Wainwright's album, you feel as though you had just been visited by a presence, and that feeling stays with you, long after the CD has ended.\n\nFrom the opening \"Far Away\", the listener is immediately swept into the CD. This song is subtle, building up ever so slightly, and is slightly underwhelming, which gives the song the perfect effect. The hauntingly beautiful background vocals add a nice touch. The more upbeat \"G.P.T.\" has an infectious, singsong verse before going into its' soulful chorus. The bluesy morose \"Factory\" shows a more vulnerable side to Martha Wainwright. \"These Flowers\" has a kind-of a dream-like lullaby atmosphere. \"Ball and Chain,\" (not a cover of the classic Janis Joplin song) sounds somewhat Janis-Joplin like. It is here that Wainwright lets down all restraints and finally lets all that had been building up inside her explode. \"Why does this always happen?\" she yells, demanding an answer, yet knowing none will come. The album comes back to earth with the beautiful \"Don't forget\" a song about lost love. These types of songs are so clich,' but Wainwright sounds so sincere, and this song feels so lived in, that it's impossible not to be moved. The tongue-in-cheek \"This Life,\" tries to answer the question of whether the monotony of life in general is worth living. The light percussion over the subtle strumming of the acoustic strings creates the perfect backdrop for the song. Although it is asked whether or not suicide is the answer, this seemingly heavy-handed topic does not emotionally drain the listener the way an Alice In Chains song might. It's as though these suicidal ideas are just passing thoughts, not to be taken seriously. The catchy mid-paced \"When the day is Short,\" keeps the momentum going. The brutally honest \"Bloody Mother F***ing A** Hole\" is one of the album's centerpieces. You'd expect a song with a title like that to sound like Hole or Babes In Toyland, but that's not the case at all. This acoustic song starts out very subtle, building up angst as it rolls along, as though the hurt and resentment inside had been building up a long time and now is being vented out. But when Wainwright delivers the main lines \"you bloody mother f***ing A** hole,\" she sounds more hurt than angry. \"I will not pretend, I will not put on a smile, I will not say I'm alight for you, for you, whoever you are.\" In other words, she is taking a stand, against anyone who would try to supress her, or not let her be herself. The explicit content sounds especially powerful because it comes out of left field. It's really unexpected. It's not like an Eminem album where every-other word is f*** this and f*** that. The bluesy easy-going \"TV Show\" has an engrossing stream-like lyrical flow. There's an array of strings in the background that are effective, yet subtle. The singsong \"Maker\" is enchanting, especially when the lush array of background vocals in the chorus kick in. The somber stripped-down acoustic \"Who was I kidding\" is heavyhearted, yet not overdone. The elegant piano balled \"Whiter I Must Wander\" is the perfect way to close out the album, ending on a whisper.\n\nMartha Wainwright's debut is a truly wonderful listen, through and through. It's brutally honest, yet not melodramatic, confident, yet never cocky. Martha Wainwright is an amazing and very promising talent. One of the best CDs of 2005.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"The Honeydrippers consisted of two members of the collapsed band called Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. After Page and Plant added some new faces they had a new band, The Honeydrippers. Their new band does some great covers some of their songs. Unfortunately, this CD is rather short--and that disappoints me. What we do get, though, is excellent quality!\n\nThe track set begins with \"I Get A Thrill.\" The band gives the arrangement a big band\/swing\/50s rock and roll flavor to this number; and the band harmonizes to perfection! Listen for some great piano playing; and the drums and percussion bolster \"I Get A Thrill\" very well. Love that electric guitar, too! \"Sea Of Love\" opens with a grand musical flourish from the violins; and when the band comes in they play and sing without a superfluous note! \"Sea Of Love\" gives us The Honeydrippers delivering one of their strongest, most enchanting love ballads ever. They harmonize well as they sing this nostalgic song to celebrate the joys of being in love. The musical interlude uses the electric guitar very well, too.\n\n\"I Got A Woman\" is a song written by the late great Ray Charles; The Honeydrippers pick up the tempo to perform this song at a faster than normal clip. The tempo helps to emphasize the joyfulness of this number that has a man celebrating his love for his woman. The band delivers this flawlessly; and the horn solo during the musical interlude impresses me very much. \"Young Boy Blues\" uses some great chord changes to make this number special, too.\n\nThe CD ends with the awesome track entitled \"Rockin' At Midnight.\" If you really want to hear rock mixed with both big band and swing, listen for THIS ballad. The band celebrates being out on the town with their girlfriends; and the musical arrangement pulls out all the stops to make this number stun you with its power! The guitar solo bolsters the number as the horns play during the musical interlude; and the overall effect of \"Rockin' At Midnight\" packs a strong punch!\n\nThe liner notes include some great artwork and we get the song credits, too.\n\nThe Honeydrippers never developed to the extent I hoped they would; but this CD gives us excellent material from a band that lacked nothing. I only wish there were more than the paltry five songs on this CD! I have to take off a star because of this disappointment.\n\nOverall, you can't go wrong with this playful, energetic CD put out by The Honeydrippers. Led Zeppelin fans will at the very least be intrigued by this CD; and people who thirst for that big band sound with those crooning vocals will love this one. Pop it in your CD player and enjoy!\n\nGreat job, guys! Thank you!","classification":4,"fold":4}
{"text":"i unintentionally found out about this edition of Gods and monsters by Jessica lange (From American Horror Story) after seeing it as a recommended purchase for those who bought the new ep songs from Madonna. Naturally, both due to the fact that I like gods and monsters by lana del rey and the affordable price for the song I went ahead and purchased and listened to this song. For starters, both lana del rey and Jessica lange both sing gods and monters in their own unique and brilliant ways so Im going to avoid getting in the game of who I feel is better. Second, as per what I agree with what some online commenters said, you cannot compare these two women, even though the song title is different, because certain lyrics of the song were changed to make the song acceptable for television viewing. Also, the songs are based on two completely different themes which slightly change the meanings of Gods and Monsters for each singer. Anyhow gods and monsters by Jessica Lange, Im also going by what I saw in the online music video, appears to symbolize how she (the singer) wants to meet someone who makes her feel alive. Jessica Langes American Horror story  character also changes the vocal range of her song when she senses that she is being watched.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Silver-toned Ed Brown's 50 year news reporting career included stints at WMCA-570 AM and WNEW-1130 AM in NYC and for the RKO and NBC radio networks. He retired in 1997 after some years at WCHL-1360, in Chapel Hill, NC.\n\nFounded in 1925 as a 5,000 watt station at the top of the AM dial, by 1960 WMCA adopted their successful \"Good Guys\" Top 40 format. Despite competition from 50,000 watt clear channel WABC-770, 'MCA was NYC's ratings champ from 1963 through '66. By 1970, they transitioned to an all talk format called \"Dial-Log Radio.\"\n\nNYC's PREMIER ALBUMS was founded in 1959 as a budget operation with such labels as CORONET and SPIN-O-RAMA. In 1965, Premier bought out Philly-based CAMEO\/PARKWAY. Their JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY - A MEMORIAL ALBUM (#2099) is fine-quality: a substantial disc with good audio. The record reproduces in full a one-hour show narrated by Brown and broadcast over WMCA on the day of JFK's murder, 11\/22\/63. All but two speeches selected are excerpts.\n\nThe LP's back cover has the memorial service eulogy given by Cardinal Richard Cushing of Massachusetts, and the lying in state remarks of House Speaker John McCormack (of Boston), Chief Justice Earl Warren (former Gov. of CA.) and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (of MT.). Mansfield's comments were briefest, but also the most moving:\n\n\"There was a sound of laughter; in a moment, it\nwas no more. And so she took a ring from her finger\nand placed it in his hands.\nThere was a husband who asked much and gave much,\nand out of the giving and the asking wove with a\nwoman what could not be broken in life, and in a\nmoment it was no more. And so she took a ring from\nher finger and placed it in his hands, and kissed him\nand closed the lid of a coffin.\nA piece of each of us died at that moment. Yet, in\ndeath he gave of himself to us. He gave us of a good\nheart from which the laughter came. He gave us of a\nprofound wit, from which a great leadership emerged.\"\n\nSIDE ONE\n[21:20] Oath of Office (1\/20\/61); Campaign speech on being Catholic; \"New Frontier\" acceptance speech, 1960 Democratic Convention, L.A.; First Nixon-Kennedy Debate; Inaugural Address, unedited (1\/20\/61)\n\nSIDE TWO\n[27:10] West Berlin and the dangers of Communism's expansion (Alliance For Progress); U.S. Steel price increases (spring '62); Cuban Missile Crisis TV speech, conclusion (Oct. '62); Civil Rights speech; Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (autumn '63)","classification":5,"fold":4}

Ms Wainwright is an accomplished vocalist and a very good lyricist. However, her lyrics can become a bit meandering at times and she seems to happy singing about subjects that just go on and on. At times I have really no idea what she is singing about at all but it sure sounds beautiful. The production value on this album is outstanding and the sound is crisp. The book-let is a mixed bag and the photo on the cover is terrible and looks like it has been taken by some high-school kid or shot with a cheap instant camera. The font is easy on the eye and the lyrics are therefore easy to read.

{"text":"Dear Music Appreciators,\n\nI know of a pretty famous and oft-awarded pop bluegrass band that uses multiple lead singers, and honestly I get nervous whenever they switch away from their star vocalist because I'm afraid I'm not going to like those songs as much.  Not so with Old Crow Medicine Show.  For one thing, this isn't pop bluegrass is it - this sounds like some kind of cocaine fueled punk rock hillbilly house party.\n\nOCMS seem to be a band in the best sense of the word.  Not only are the members playing and harmonizing like a tightly-knit family, but they also have three outstanding lead vocalists - kind of like an all male redneck Fleetwood Mac I guess...but hopefully without the affairs. ..\n\nThere is an urgency, confidence, and authenticity to this music that is contagious.  Notice the double-time tempo right out of the gate on album opener (and title song) \"Carry Me Back.\"  On \"We Don't Grow Tobacco\" there is something haunting about the singer's swaggering sadness, and when I heard the lines \"I would chop that wicked weed \/ till our hands and fingers bleed \/ working like a mule, maybe more\" I knew I would be hooked for the rest of the album.  Then comes \"Levi\" - a touching, down-home, sing-along story song about Iraq war casualty Leevi Barnard.  Three songs, three different flavors, not a phony second to be found - it's appropriate that the band name contains the word \"show\" - because just like an old-timey variety show the band seems to be care that its audience has a good time and there is a little something for everyone here.\n\nAnd that's just the first quarter of the album.\n\nThis album made me feel like I was wearing a wife-beater with my hair slicked back and a cigarette behind my ear driving a beat up classic car fast down a dirt road in the deep south with the windows down.\n\nBuy this, and get in touch with your inner hillbilly.\n\nSincerely,\n\nConstant Listener","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Nina Persson's \"Black Winged Bird\" is lilting and soothing, romantic and bordering on melancholy.  The relaxing flow of this song makes it inherently listenable as foreground or background music.\n\nI particularly like the fact that the song relies on Nina's vocal talents and not on overdone electronica or instrumental overkill.  The strings and other back-up instruments that complement Persson's voice are spot on.\n\nWhile this song may not have the pop appeal or driving force it usually takes to gain major recognition, I've had this track on my iPod's playlist ever since it was made available at Amazon.com.\n\nThis song isn't what I'd cal mainstream country, folk, or even pop, but is an intruiging mixture of those genres.

{"text":"Rhino Records which has already released a dozen of Chicago's first albums as enhanced re-issues, has put out this 20 song offering.  Chicago : What's It Gonna Be Santa\" is a re-issue of \"Chicago XXV\" , a superb contemporary collection of Christmas classics with a Chicago original mixed in. This new release however, adds six newly recorded tracks to the 14 on Chicago XXV, making an already good thing even better.\n\nThe original selection of Christmas tunes is simply terrific. Chicago, following in the approach of \"Night and Day Big Band\" wherein the American supergroup re-arranged big band classics with an inventive and fresh variety of styles, tempos and grooves, takes a similar artistic path with their Christmas release.\n\nSuch holiday standards as \"White Christmas\" and \"The Christmas Song\" are done in an uptempo pop-funk style while \"Let It Snow!\" shows off Chicago's ability to really rock in a blues shuffle groove. Bill Champlin's soulful \"Have Yourself a Merry Little\" Christmas\" gives this moody classic a wonderfully original blues treatment. And, throughout the disc, the legendary Chicago horns play through trombonist Jimmy Pankow's melodic arrangements in their unique, warm and fat style.\n\nThe six new tracks really compliment the original CD, adding even more new styles and sounds. The disc's opener, Bobby Lamm's \"Winter Wonderland\" lays down an infectious rock groove with excellent vocal arrangements making great use of Chicago's arsenal of superb vocalists. Lead guitarist Keith Howland who covers some tunes in concert, shows off his first studio lead vocal with a quick tempo pop rock version of \"Jolly Old Saint Nicholas\". Bassist Jason Scheff's tenor has never sounded better than on \"This Christmas\", which has a wonderful 70's soul retro sound with the Chicago horns propelling the arrangement. Bill Champlin again shows why he is probably the greatest blue-eyed soul singer around with a gutsy, funky \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\". It sounds like an odd combination, but this track really works.\n\nFollowing up to his terrific arrangement of \"Let It Snow!\", trumpeter Lee Loughnane pens a superb shuffle version of \"Sleigh Ride\". Again, he steps behind the microphone to tackle lead vocal duties and his deep voice, reminiscent of the late Terry Kath's depth and timbre lends itself perfectly to this classic.\n\n\"Chicago: What's It Gonna Be Santa\" is just terrific and certainly one of the most inventive and eclectic holiday CD's by any artist. There's something for everyone here to enjoy.\n\nEssential holiday listening as well as essential Chicago.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"This was probably my favorite album last year, and it's not the typical sort of music that I listen to. But I tell you, play this album a few times and it's mighty hard NOT to fall in love with these songs. This is pop music with a dance beat, songs with beats and hooks. But don't think this is lightweight, disposable fare. Oh no, there is depth in these musical waters too.\n\nTo my ears, this band sounds like something you'd get if you crossed the Pet Shops with Abba, plus something with a slightly harder edge, such as Coldplay (not they they are very \"hard\" sounding, but hopefully you get the idea). These songs are totally infectious and exude joy and passion. I've had this in heavy rotation for several months and still don't get tired of it. Dance if you want to!

{"text":"With the release of the Killers' debut album Hot Fuss, their sound helped usher in a revival of the new wave sound (something that I, a big fan of `80s music, had absolutely no problem with). Now they come back at us with Sam's Town, an album that is getting very heavily mixed reviews. But I think it's somewhere in the middle.\n\nAt first, though, I had to make sure that this was really the Killers. Not that their sound is any different, but, well, it's still the same four guys, but they look, like, ten years older now (and drummer Ronnie Vannucci, Jr. now looks like Jason Lee). Anyway, I wasn't that much into \"When You Were Young\" for a long time, but it's really grown on me now. But my favorite song would have to be the current single, \"Read My Mind\".\n\nThere are also a few songs on here that sound like Brandon and the boys are shooting for an arena rock sound. Not that the songs sound bad, but I think listeners would appreciate them more if they were heard at live performances. Oh, well; \"This River Is Wild\" and \"Bling (Confession of a King)\" are decent enough.\n\nBut then you have a group of corny tracks like \"My List\", \"For Reasons Unknown\" and \"Bones\" (sorry; I never liked that song). And the intro and outro are pretty cheesy too (and shouldn't the intro be the first track instead of the second track?). As another reviewer hinted at, Sam's Town is an okay place to visit, but you might want to revisit Hot Fuss first.\n\nAnthony Rupert","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"Well we know dude is rich. I mean dude was one of the biggest drug dealers in the NY. He got 1 mil to sign with Eminem. He has already made about 1 1\/2 mil from his independent CD \"Guess Who's Back\"(he got 5 dollars for every CD sold and he's sold abt 250,000 copies already) and This CD has sold about 1.8 million copies in a week and a half. So yeah dude is rich. Is the bang to hype ratio right should be the proper question. I'd have to say yes. Listening to this CD to me is like the first time is saw \"New Jack City\" or heard the infamous GETO BOYS. It's just unadulterated thugism! Being shot 9 times and havin such a horrible childhood really proves to be a backdrop for this CD. The CD starts with \"What up Gangsta\". A cool lil song settin the tone for the rest of the CD. Track 3 \"Patiently Waiting\" features Eminem.. They go real hard on this one. Great sound effects on this one. One of the better cuts on the CD. Track 4 \"Many Men\" is cool but I was really feelin the lyrics, especially when he talks about dude that shot him. Of course track 5 \"In Da Club\" probably will be the club song of the year. I've never heard a song looped so much in the club. They play this song for 10 minutes straight and the club stays hype! Track 6 \"High All the Time\" is his tribute to the sticky icky! Good cut. Track 7 \"Heat\" is classic Dre production. This song is just raw! A gun cocks in the background on the wholeeeee song. Track 8 is another Dre staple song. Track 9 \"Blood Hound\" is a cool song with a nice little chorus. He sounds alot like Bushwick Bill on this one. Track 10 \"Back down\" is one of the CD highlights. Dude rips Ja Rule apart!!!! Track 11 \"P I M P\" is another banger. Track 12 \"Like My Style\" features his crew G UNIT. My  2nd favorite cut on the CD is track 14 \"21 Questions\". It's a Dre production with Nate Dogg. This song is essentially a song talkin to a girl and askin her questions to see where her mind is at. Great song and Nate Dogg hasn't sounded this good in a longgggg time. The beat is off da hook. Track 15 \"Don't Push Me\" features Eminem again and once again is STRONG. Track 16 \"Gotta make it to Heaven, I'm going thru Hell\" pretty much sums up this CD. Just raw East Coast Gansta Rap! \"Wanksta\" makes an appearance here but really it's just a playful radio cut to me. Overall this CD is great. He puts his foot down and even steps to Nas and Jigga. My favorite tracks are 2-11, 14-16. I personally haven't heard anything this raw in a long long time. The hype for this dude is incredible and fortunately the CD comes about as close as it possibly could to that. After a few earchecks this is a must have for the true hip hop fan..","classification":4,"fold":4}
{"text":"It has been awhile since we've heard anything brilliant from Shania Twain and Lionel Richie for quite awhile. With what they've both had to deal with, Shania losing her husband, Mutt Lange and finding out he had cheated and abused her, and with Lionel losing his friends like Michael Jackson and Don Cornelius to name a few. But for Lionel reworking on his classics for his album Tuskegee, he went back to the basics and a country twist on his classics. Lionel and Shania teaming up for Endless Love, actually feels fresh and new to a whole new era of fans. The song sounds pretty good from beginning to end, and a nice new start for Shania Twain. While Lionel showcased bits from himself, to the classic he had made with Diana Ross, there still is a lot of chemistry between the two of them in song and heart.

'I Dreamed a Dream' was a pleasant album to listen to, though by no means revolutionary, yet most people were not bothered by this given that the album's muse was in here late forties.  On&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Gift\/dp\/B003GAMPWM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Gift<\/a>, Boyle similarly doesn't ruffle any feathers, but go `round, people take notice of the `lack of flair' about 'The Gift.'  Sure, Boyle sounds beautiful, but even at times this is compromised if for no other reason than the overly safeness of the performances and the blandness of the material from this album.  Even more confusing may be the fact that 'The Gift' tries to `have cake and eat it too' by poising itself as `holiday' effort that also includes a couple of neutral pop numbers.  The results are not quite a flop (and it won't fill like a flop to Boyle's more committed fan base), but an album that produces only mixed results as opposed to being valedictory.\n\nBoyle starts the album on a high note with her cover of the Lou Reed cut \"Perfect Day.\"  Interesting about \"Perfect Day\" is the fact that Boyle recorded an accompanying music video for the track - her first.  The production is typical of the airy, moody and atmospheric production that characterized the majority of cuts from 'I Dreamed a Dream.'  Here use of strings and piano serve as a nice, if simple backdrop for Boyle.  Vocally beautiful,  Boyle's vocals are restrained and plaintive, though by no means revolutionary or extraordinary. Nonetheless, \"Perfect Day\" is arguably the best track on The Gift.  Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\" attempts the same grandeur with chilly piano, strings, and ambiance-driven background vocals, but does not achieve the same `high watermark.'  \"Hallelujah\" proves to be so slow that it comes over as lethargic;  the lethargy actually takes away from the appeal of this ubiquitous classic.  The production is so dense and lacking in clarity that it feels `mushed' together as opposed to having a sense of organization.\n\n\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\" resounds the atmospheric production that characterizes Boyle's sound, which makes the listener wonder `why does every production have to sound the same?'  Nonetheless, pure vocals by Boyle smothered in reverb prove to captivate enough that \"Do You Hear What I Hear?\" atones for the overly slow treatment of \"Hallelujah.\" That said, the predictability of this track is even more pronounced than usual for a Christmas track, perhaps due in part to the predictability that surrounds this traditional singer.  \"Don't Dream It's Over\" is a nice enough pop turn from Boyle, but again,  the track sounds sleepy despite a solid vocal from Boyle.  Again, this is a `pop' song interspersed between Christmas cuts, which is an odd premise in the first place.  That said, follow-up cut \"The First Noel\" is perfect (as perfect as any cut can be on this affair) with a nice change of pace including accompaniment initially by acoustic guitar and a natural feeling evolution within this cut.  \"The First Noel\" puts `some pep in the step' of the album giving it a bit more life and showing off Susan Boyle, the star that all feel in love with.\n\n\"O Holy Night\" isn't bad, though the production recalls \"Amazing Grace's\" treatment from her prior effort.  Boyle attempts to achieve magic at the end on the tried-and-true climax \"O Night Divine,\" but false vocals from the singer slightly dilutes the emotion.  Again, dense production makes \"O Holy Night\" feel a bit all-over-the-place.  \"Away in a Manger\" is predictable, opening with a choir covering the first verse and Boyle handling duties on the second verse supported by strings.  Again, `the formula' grows old here; a brief length serves as a highlight of this cut.\n\n\"Make Me a Channel of Your Piece\" is lovely, but ultimately a bore serving more as `background music' than a vital piece of The Gift.  \"Auld Lang Syne\" is pleasant while closing cut \"O Come All Ye Faithful\" feels appropriately placed and closes the album solidly, but again by no means exceptionally.\n\nOverall, 'The Gift' feels lukewarm and underwhelming.  Boyle sounds strong enough, but the strength that propelled her on British Got Talent feels absent here - or at least compromised by the murky production and predictable, unexceptional material on the album. That is hard to say sense carols and covers themselves are rather predictable, but maybe just a slight change of pace or alterations of these classics might have taken the tone and the enjoyability of 'The Gift' to the next level.","classification":3,"fold":4}

This Is How We Do, the fourth single from her lackluster album Prism feels more like it is a trip back to an 80's style song that feels more like it is lost within its time and absolute heart.

{"text":"This is an album about loss and survival. It's darker than some of Lucinda's other releases. It may not be for all Williams fans; it certainly is very different and more experimental than her last three albums. If you're uncertain about it the first time, give it a couple of other spins--it'll grow on you. The depth of emotion and Lucinda's raw vocals (meaning they weren't re-recorded--producer Hal Wilner used the demo vocal tracks as he loved the emotion in the performances) give this album an extra kick. I've seen some mixed reviews from fans here--I suspect this is an album that fans will probably come back to later and realize how good it is.\n\nClearly under the influence of later Dylan (perhaps \"Time Out of Mind\"), the album features a nice mixture of midtempo numbers and killer ballads. Williams' voice which aches with longing and bitterness in many of these songs continues to be one of her strengths in addition to her top notch songwriting. She strikes reminds me somewhat of John Hiatt. \"Words\" has one of the sweetest melodies Williams has come up with the opening line sums up much of this album--\"I would rather suffer in sweet silent solitude\". She may feel like she's in solitude but these moving, observant songs open up a world to music fans everywhere.\n\nThe music clips might be a bit deceptive. This is a moody, atmospheric album (even more so than her previous efforts). It also sounds even more personal than usual. The musicians that provide backing on the album including vets such as Jim Keltner give the album a distinctive sound. Producer Hal Willner does a great job of capturing the rich, distinctive qualities of Williams' voice.\n\nThis is one of Williams' finest albums holding its own with \"Lucinda Williams\", \"Sweet Old World\" and \"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road\". Be aware, however, if you are a Williams fan that this is probably one of her more experimental albums and one of her most moody, atmospheric productions yet. Kudos to Hal Willner who convinced Williams to keep many of her raw, demo vocals for the album. What they may lack in polish they make up for in emotion.\n\nBestBuy is currently offering an edition with a second disc featuring two demos for tracks on the main album. \"Where Is My Love\" and \"Rescue\" (both terrific songs). Personally, I'd love to hear some acoustic demos or performances of some of these songs vs. electric demos but that's me. Pick it up today!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I just saw the movie and actually enjoyed it...it got trashed royally, which made me even more curious as to why...and no, it did not deserve the harsh treatment it garnered.  I enjoy all movies revolving around the music business, and this one is no different... it reminded me of the live remake of Josie & the Pussycats.  My only quibble is why the label and exec (played here by the ace Juliette Lewis) always feel the need to break the original band apart with lies and bad contracts?? And saying it was all Jerrica's greedy idea, the fans won't know the difference because they didn't know who is the real person behind the name, they can be replaced, the label owns the name, etc...it's getting to be a bit cliche and makes all labels look bad, and may in fact discourage artists from pursuing careers in the music biz and signing to labels in the first place.  Besides that, Aubrey Peeples (Layla Grant on Nashville) is just great as Jerrica\/Jem...and the soundtrack is fun pop...but it shoulda been a CD as well...people want hard copies...for the music and the artwork and photos...yes you can back it up on a CDR but it's not the same.  I think it was digital only because the movie was such a bomb... If it was successful, yes there woulda been a CD...even School Boy prez and artist manager Scooter Braun makes a cameo but it was cut from the final movie...you can see him in the deleted scenes...maybe that snub cut the CD?? Hmmm...but \"Young Blood\" sounds like Rachel Platten's \"Fight Song\" meets Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood\". Nothing original about the music on this soundtrack at all...but it's fun.  Will it be listened to in 5 years, let alone TWO?? Probably not...and making it digital only will cut the lifespan by 85%...most people will not know of its existence because it's not a CD you can buy or on display at your local Target either.

Cuz Kendrick is spitting straight from the heart and not asking from approval from anyone or anything. I think a lot of artists are losing the ability to create music like this because these record companies are taking too much control to the point they can't be artists like they want to be their just puppets hanging on strings at the mercy of these old ass execs who don't live in the hood and never have and have no connection or relation to the people who consume this music(and that's people of all races). Take Lupe Fiasco for example, if he wouldn't have stood up for himself and told the record company, no, I wonder what would have happened? Maybe one day these artists will wake up and say f these record companies and do it on their own and pay they own taxes. (Seen too many artists being hounded by the gov't and IRS behind something the people they were paying were supposed to do) Cuz seems like being hooked up to a record company doesn't help cuz they give you the advertisement but if you ain't making hits you get treated like a bish. Like Lupe said he went gold last album before his latest release and got multiple awards but they told him that that wasn't good enough. I pray Kendrick never gets tied up in that system. This is one album I have to say you can listen to without skipping a single track. That's rare these days, real rare.","classification":5,"fold":4}

Her song Booty has to honestly one of the worst songs that she has came out with altogether. She and Iggy Azalea really do not have any chemistry whatsoever.

NIN has always been somewhat of an experimental outlet for Trent.  Yet even as minimal of a change it is in theory to go instrumental, it's the actual material here that I find so different and so interesting.\n\nFor starters, there is much more of a progression from song to song than on other NIN albums.  Even as an instrumental work this seems more like a concept album than anything else he's ever done.  There's a full range of songs and tones here, almost like an opera or a symphony.  This is truly mesmerizing.\n\nI also enjoyed the fact that so much of this album is more \"mellow\" than what NIN usually does.  It produces something that I feel is almost more accessible than most previous albums.  Anybody who is into Jazz and even people who are into newer classical music could probably get into this.\n\nAnd that's the other thing, the pricing for this is awesome!  Not only is there an MP3 download for only $5 but you can get the whole set on disk for $10.  When you consider what's been going on in the record industry lately this is a breath of fresh air.  Part of that might be because of the specialty nature of this recording.  But I think most people who heard individual tracks wouldn't even know it was NIN.  If anything the appeal is broader for this instrumental set.\n\nYou can download other stuff including a pdf document from the NIN website.  This is a great set that I plan on listening to and studying for a while.\n\nHope you like it as much as I did.\n\nEnjoy!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"1972 and 1973 were the years that the Spinners finally got the chance to breakthrough to a wide audience after years on Motown without any huge success.  Now with producer\/writer team Thom Bell\/Linda Creed, and a deal on Atlantic, they Spinners' hard work finally paid off after years.  This joint is surely a winner, with some heavy hitting mid-tempo soul jams.  This one contains some legendary jams like the rolling funk of \"I'll Be Around\" and \"Could It Be I'm Falling in Love\" heavily laden with strings, a staple of Philly Soul.  \"I'll Be Around\" is one of my favorite soul jams of all time, and even though I am 10 years younger than the song is, I remember listening to it and loving it in junior high school (in the mid 90's) when L.A. hip-hop station Power 106 FM had time set aside time for old school jams.  Rapper Rappin' 4-Tay also made his own version of it in 1994, a wonderful hip-hop jam which took the funky rolling music and some of the hook vocals for the rap song.  Another one of my favorites here is \"Just Me and You Baby,\" a slower, ballad type jam with heavenly harmony.  \"Ghetto Child\" is heavy mid-tempo jam exploring the bad side of growing up in the `hood, very sad and timeless.  \"How Could I Let You Get Away\" is a sadder lyrically rich song laden with sitars later in the song.  Phillipe Wynne, Bobbie Smith (great singers), and company surely deliver a rich album full of lush Thom Bell production and sweet harmony and melody; the transition from Detroit to Philly surely was a lucrative one.  1974's Mighty Love is another wonderful soulful album as is 1975's Pick of the Litter.

{"text":"When Revocation first emerged on the metal scene, we knew something different was afoot, and that was the playing of leader\/guitarist extraordinaire Dave Davidson, a musician of the calibre of the ultra greats.  Instead of relying on the usual bag of tricks most metal and death metal players use, Davidson threw in more curveballs than you could believe, with quirky choices of notes, delightful off kilter chord patterns and an innovative approach that got the attention of lots of people outside the metal realm.  Imagine Frank Zappa, Adrian Belew and other denizens of very precise yet unhinged playing.\n  The new album \"Great Is Our Sin\" is, like the others, Revocation at their best, but there are some differences here that are worth pointing out.  First, the production seems to be a bit tighter, the guitar interplay a little more refined, making the riffs and hooks stand out a little better.  It still belts out the power but has become less cluttered.  The other is a few sections of clean and harmonizing vocals, a trend many death bands are starting to rediscover, and in this case, the clean vocals are such a welcome addition.  It makes those parts stand out like sore thumbs, especially the harmony parts.  I hope Revocation ditches the screaming all the way around because it will bring more attention to arrangements and hooks.  The whole schtick of grunting is getting old and my prediction is that there will be a fairly sizable reversion back to singing vocals.  It won't be complete, but it will happen.  \"Great Is Our Sin\" is a great metal album, fans of King Crimson and other experimental sounds will be interested, and if their cards are played right, this is the album that could propel Revocation into the big time without sacrificing their signature wackiness and heaviness doing it.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Yeah, I'm a Dixie Chicks fan, and they've been kind of dormant for a few years now, so I was a bit excited regarding two-thirds of the group putting out a \"side project\", the Court Yard Hounds with their self-titled disk.d\n\nSide project is in quotes because only part of me believes the Chicks will record again and that this is really the new full-tine gig of sisters Emily Robison and Martie Maguire.\n\nWhile talented in their own right - both sisters are very accomplished multi-instrumentalists and songwriters - they do lack a certain spark that Natalie Maines brought to the trio as their vocalist.  And overall, I'm being nice.\n\nCYH is kind of snooze of an album.  It has all the right intentions and a lot of talent, but like I said, no spark.\n\nWith all due respect to the sisters, they were wise to hire a lead singer of Maines' capabilities.  There is a reason the sisters sing harmony and backing vocals.  While fully capable singers, there is nothing distinctive about what they do here.  There are hundreds of female vocalists already out there who sing with mediocrity (\"April's Love\", \"Skyline\", \"Fear of Wasted Time\", \"Well Behaved\", etc).  Too add insult to injury, they pick the least charismatic collaborator when having Jakob Dylan duet on one song.  He doesn't even compliment the lead vocal.\n\nThere are a few songs that have the right idea, but aren't quite there - like \"Delight (Something New Under the Sun)\", that you can't think if Maines were taking the lead vocals, it would work.\n\nAnd then there are ones that are a slight notch above that where they make an attempt for something above a pulse, or a chart position: \"The Coast\", \"I Miss You\".\n\nI do like \"Ain't No Son\". The CHY finally kick it up, but you can't help but wonder how out of the park it could\/would have been with Maines singing this.  Still, had more of the disk been like this song, it would have been a worthy purchase.\n\nI wasn't expecting a Dixie Chicks disk, but I was expecting something more creative and not so bland.","classification":2,"fold":4}

A year from the band's breakup, Fogerty immersed himself in musical roots with an album of covers, mostly country and gospel, played and sung entirely on his own. Even the album's cover echoed the solo theme, with Fogerty silhouetted as each of the fictional group's five members. Try as he might to distance himself from Creedence, however, his unmistakable voice and a track list of country songs upon which many of his own songs were built, couldn't help but point to his previous work.\n\nThirty-six years later Fogerty has brought elements of the Blue Ridge Rangers' ethos back to the studio. Unlike the Rangers' first effort, this is more capstone and reminiscence than a place to gather oneself between career phases. More importantly, rather than layering his own instrumental and vocal performances in the studio, Fogerty's put together an actual Blue Ridge Rangers with the talents of guitarist Buddy Miller, steel\/mandolin\/dobro player Greg Leisz, drummer Kenny Aranoff and many others. He's also chosen to share the microphone with Eagles Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmit on Rick Nelson's \"Garden Party,\" and Bruce Springsteen on the Everly Brothers' \"When Will I Be Loved.\"\n\nThe song list remains an all-covers affair, including an earthy take of Fogerty's own \"Change in the Weather\" that drops the unfortunate mid-80s production of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Eye-of-the-Zombie\/dp\/B00005B7FG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Eye of the Zombie<\/a>'s original. There are classic country tunes from Ray Price, Buck Owens and the Kendalls, but Fogerty also reaches to fellow singer-songwriters John Prine, Rick Nelson and John Denver, and favorites from Delaney & Bonnie, Pat Boone and the 1964 Jumpin' Gene Simmons R&B novelty, \"Haunted House.\" Highlights include Prine's environmentalist lyric of a bucolic childhood literally trucked away by a coal company and a take of Denver's \"Back Home Again\" that's adds a bit of Neil Young-like reediness to the original.\n\nFogerty sounds relaxed and at home surrounded by fiddle and steel and riding a Ray Price shuffle beat, and the husk of his voice adds an element of solemn pain and earthen soul to Pat Boone's melodramatic death ballad, \"Moody River.\" The album closes with an overcooked Cajun-rock arrangement of \"When Will I Be Loved\" that has Fogerty and Springsteen reprising Phil and Don Everly. Though it's more of a lark than an artistic summit, it's great to hear two modern icons wailing away at their shared roots. That really sums up Fogerty's decision to bring the Blue Ridge Rangers back to life, as it's an opportunity for a great artist to revel in his equally great influences.

This was one of two projects I was excited to hear this year (the other being Sepentine Dominion with Corpsegrinder). First and foremost, just because you like Pantera and Down, does NOT guarantee you will like this album, it is very different from anything else you've heard from Phil. Musically it is very much a blackened death metal project, not unlike something along the lines of Behemoth. Vocally, I don't know that I've ever heard Phil growl like this. Sure, he did a lot of screaming and growling in Pantera, but nothing quite like the caliber of growling you witness him doing on this album. It's very dark, it's heavy, it's punishing, it is not for the faint of heart. It's everything I hoped it would be and more.

{"text":"I have gotten ripped on previously Casting Crowns reviews because I gave them 4 stars instead of 5...so there is no doubt people will go crazy with this review.  But with that being said, this CD just wasn't very good.  Once again Casting Crowns does what it does best - write songs pointing the finger at the church.  Yes, it was a good song with \"If We Are The Body\" and \"Does Anybody Hear Her,\" but with \"What This World Needs,\" it's just gotten old now.  It starts to become annoying when a band harps on one point, especially one that is as generalizing as saying the church isn't doing what it is supposed to.  Move on to another topic!!!\n\nThis CD also lacks the catchiness of the last 2 albums.  And where the last 2 CD's had a solid 6 or 7 songs on them, this album has 2 at most.  I just couldn't get into any of the songs.  Musically, it is average and the lyrics are not up to par.  Looking forward to the new David Crowder Band album, though, which will surely not disappoint.  Hope Casting Crowns pulls it together for its next album.  This one will sell a lot of units, but will not stand the test of time.  It will collect dust on my shelf.","classification":2,"fold":4}

{"text":"I always like groups with a sense of humor. Offspring seem to have a good rock 'n' roll view of humor.\nAmazingly, their songs are general and genial enough to be able to comment on our culture as well as\nother cultures.\n\nDoes this song comment on the apparent cultural taboos of physical closeness, say, at a school dance\nAND\/or restrictive religious cultures? 'You gotta keep 'em separated'.\n\nThey don't have the cutting social satire of The Tubes ('I Was A Punk Before You Were A Punk'), but\nOffspring appears to have sustained much longer due to their focus on the Rock and the Roll instead\nof being a satirist rock group.\n\nThe simple, almost Ramonsian straight forward three rock chords stick in your brain and repeats itself so\nas to center on the words. It's almost like you could play this song without any training. It is simple.\nYet, that is the original thrust of Rock 'N' Roll: keep it simple.

{"text":"It has been a very long time since we have really anything driven from Ciara. Musically, she has had a lot going wrong for her in her own albums, not only they have been very poor, but they absolutely have failed to ignite on sales. She has really rushed her music out so much that she has really faltered in her own work. Her songs have not really simply done very well. Her last album Ciara, has failed to ignite in sales, and with the over-releasing early songs, she just has left  less for her fans. For what has been going on for her Jackie record, has shown she really has to find better for her own voice and motherhood. This isn't the 2000 decade anymore. Dance Like We're Making Love, the second single from Jackie fails to ignite a passion that can make you dance from the soul, just a whimper to become a wallflower. I found this song to be just as lackluster as I Bet was. It is definitely time for Ciara to consider retiring from music, if she keeps making poor songs like this one did.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":4}

{"text":"This album shows what truly made the Bee Gees great and that they stood on their own merit of great songs and wonderful productions. This album is their Crowning Achievement of the 4 they would release in the 1960's in only a short 2 year period! This remaster was done wonderfully and even has the original red velvet cover with the big gold lettering of the original. As an earlier reviewer stated, this album definitely got the royal treatment! From a historical perspective, Odessa was such a strong statement by the band and was one of three epic double albums released that year by a British Band, the other 2 being \"Tommy\" by the Who and \"White\" album as it's called by the Beatles.\n\nAlthough never really thought of in this way, the Bee Gees were a part of the last wave of the \"British Invasion\" bands and were, even at their young age, contemporaries of the other bands such as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Who, Yardbirds, etc. This album was the one that there manager, Robert Stigwood, really wanted to be a kind of \"statement\" album. The band was growing up and their songs and sound, already incredible, were becoming more mature and evolving. The comparisions to the Beatles have always been uncalled for in my opinion as I have always felt that the brothers had a sound and style of writing that was uniquely theirs.\n\nBarry & Robin Gibb, in my opinion, were every bit the writers as Lennon\/McCartney or Townshend\/Entwhistle or Jaggar\/Richards and this album is proof of how intricate and diverse their songs could be. The epic title track shows their strong ability to \"story tell\" as they take us on a journey across the atlantic ocean. Then you have songs with a country fell such as \"Marley Purt Drive\" to the folk sounding \"Melody Fair\" to the bouncy \"Suddenly\" amongst others. Maurice Gibbs wonderful talent for writing melodies and being able to play multiple instruments really comes through strong as well.\n\nThis album really showed that the \"boys\" were growing up musically, at the time of its release, Barry was 22 and Robin and Maurice 19. Unfortunately, after the release of this album, problems arose to the point that Robin left the band and the next album was recorded without him. Fortunately for us, their fans, he would return after a brief hiatus and they would then begin the second phase of their incredible careers. That being said, Odessa was truly the Crown Jewel of the early phase of their careers and a wonderful album, fresh and clean, all these years later.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"When Failure disassembled in 1997, their brand of space-rock was largely out of step with the rock scene and quite frankly, ahead of its time. Though their influence on countless bands heard on the radio in the years that would follow was all too transparent, Failure's legacy went by largely neglected. The band's swan-song, \"Fantastic Planet\" became almost like a blueprint for like-minded heavy rock bands looking to infuse catchy hooks and haunting melodies with down-tuned guitars and chugging percussion and yet, rarely was a mention of their name ever brought up alongside other influential luminaries of the era like Tool or Alice in Chains.\n\n It's no surprise then that the band's return 19 years later sounds completely fresh and new. \"The Heart Is A Monster\" not only sounds like 100% pure Failure, the band rightfully reclaiming a sound that they invented, it also sounds modern and appropriately futuristic. Working independently (with a little crowd-funded help from their fans) the core line-up of Ken Andrews (vocals, guitar), Greg Edwards (bass) and Kellii Scott (drums) capture what made albums like the aforementioned \"Fantastic Planet\" and \"Magnified\" such intriguing listens so many years ago. From the opening of \"Segue 4,\" the band picks up where they left off nearly twenty years prior, before dipping into the absolute ear-candy of \"Hot Traveler,\" a dark and brooding anthem announcing the band's return. From there, the band merges its penchant for cinematic oddities (\"Counterfeit Sky\") with its natural gift for simple yet complex melody (\"Mulholland Dr.\") almost effortlessly. One-time touring guitarist (and current Queens of the Stone Age guitarist) Troy Van Leeuwen is brought in to help flesh out a few tracks, but for the most part, it's a concentrated band effort, sounding far removed from outside influence and all the better for it. A perfect example of this would be \"The Focus,\" a compelling ear-worm that could be a radio-hit even today. Unlike most big-name rock bands today, Failure don't need producers or ghost-writers to help them produce an insanely infectious tune, making their lack of exposure even today still so dumbfounding.\n\nFailure are in good company with the likes of Faith No More and Refused in sticking the landing of making a successful reunion album after more than a decade apart. \"The Heart Is A Monster\" is anything but a nostalgic trip or a cash-in on credibility. It is a labor of love carefully crafted by a group of top-notch musicians still in the prime of their career. Long-time fans will be just as satisfied by the effort as newcomers who perhaps have grown weary of the stagnant state of hard rock music. It seems space did Failure a great deal of good in coming back into orbit successfully. Let's just hope they don't get lost in space again for another 20 years.","classification":5,"fold":4}

The songs have a flavor of the melody typical to classic hymns (major chords, simple do-re-mi scales, few key changes) rather than more freeform and jazzy tunes. This shows up best in \"Mother's Hymnal\" where you can hear someone paging through and playing bars of favorite hymns on the piano in the living room.\n\nI found \"Midnight in Moscow\" to be quite amusing--it's almost-not-quite a Russian folk tune, very dramatic and solemn.\n\nIf you have children, this is a fun thing to play for them, either at bedtime to relax and get ready for sleep, or to use to have them use their imagination and describe scenes evoked by each piece.\n\nCD was supplied by the composer in exchange for a fair review.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"See i will never deny Javier of his talent. But i will deny him on this album because he really does not show it to the best of his abilitys on this album. He has a great voice, and he has a nag for writing really good songs. Not to mention he can play the guitar really well, which is very rare amongest most R&B singers these days. But even despite all of his positives this album lands right on the mediocre line. Its not a bad album, but he could have done alot better. The problem i had with this album is that it all sounds the same. I mean there are a few big shining spots like the single \"Crazy\" and the mid tempo track \"Biggest Mistake\" which tell the tale of how Javier lost his woman. But other than those two standout spots and a few select other tracks this album is boring. He stuck with the accoustic guitar to much on this album. All the songs sound like they were made by low end producers and none of the songs really have a groove to them. He is lacking that song that makes you wanna get up and dance. There is none of that here. Its all that neo soul accoustic guitar type of music, which by the way i love, but not when it all sounds the same. To sum it up real short, Javier has the potential to make phenominal music, he could be amongest the Ushers and R. Kellys with a little help and ALOT more promotion. This album debuted at number 86 on the top 200 albums. Thats horrible for a R&B artist on a big name recorod label (Capitol Records). Overall its an ok debut, but i hope the next one is better.\n\nGrade:\nC","classification":3,"fold":4}

I was deaf in my right Ear for six months due to a welding accident and went to Saginaw, Michigan to see Rush at the end of their Hemispheres Tour that winter.  The Rockets were the Backup Band that night.  Near the end of the show I moved from the floor up to the back center position to get the best sound.  My Ear broke open and drained out and I could here with both ears again.  I was ecstatic.  This composition was one that I could hear properly.  I love it.  They introduced Free Will, Jacob's Ladder, and The Spirit Of Radio after a final Curtain Call.  Sorry to go on so long but I also seem to remember Mr. Lee saying as the Show began, \"We're going to do everything tonight\", which may be what happened?  These Guys are Top Notch Entertainers.  Oh yeah; I had to wait for more than six months to finally get, Permanent Wave.  My Friends were sick of my promotions of Them by then.

{"text":"I quote the first line from \"Between the Two\", the fourteenth track off the Bangles' latest album Doll Revolution, because I'm wondering if this is going to be their last album. It's been 15 years since they recorded an album together, and when I looked at the liner notes -- actually, there really aren't any, which makes you wonder if they just rushed into the studio to put this album out. Also, this album is on Koch Records, and Koch seems to be the place where everyone eventually ends up -- well, either there or TVT.\nAll the other three-star reviews for this album are pretty accurate, and each person seems to have a different opinion of which song(s) stands out. To me, the best song on here is the song they have out now, \"Something That You Said\" (its video also appears on the bonus DVD). And \"Mixed Messages\" is pretty catchy despite the lyrical shortcomings. But the rest of the songs aren't that great.\nA lot of these songs really could have been written better. At times the lyrics go from lazy (\"Ride the Ride\", \"Ask Me No Questions\") to crazy (Elvis Costello's \"Tear Off Your Own Head\"). \"Grateful\" is tolerable, but it's the kind of song you'd expect to hear from them when they were still in their teens, not in their forties. And sorry, but the ballad \"I Will Take Care of You\" sounds like a watered-down version of \"Eternal Flame\".\nPeople say a lot of the songs on here sound better live than they do on the album, and if that's the case, then you should just see them in concert. Or else if you're still feeling nostalgic about the Bangles, then just pull out their `80s albums or their Greatest Hits package. The ladies can still play and sing, but I wouldn't really call Doll Revolution a revolutionary album.\nAnthony Rupert","classification":3,"fold":4}

In classical music to stay in that form, it is like reinventing the wheel. Not that new classical cannot exist or be as wonderful as the masters but what she is doing is simply awesome. This collaboration includes one of the best power female vocal singers right now, of my generation, in Lzzy Hale.

{"text":"The selection of \"war horse\" favorites is excellent. This is the kind of album to put on when you want classical music to listen to without making a decision, which composer, which piece, which album, etc. Unfortunately, the quality of the performances on this album ranges from good to almost unacceptable. The \"Ride of the Valkyries\" reminds me of an impatient person jangling his keys as he waits for the next train to pull up to the station. The \"Blue Danube\" is fine, until the percussion section weighs in, sounding like a high school marching band, only not as good. The Brandenburg #3 is sure in a choppy hurry. Who swallowed a metronome?\n\nSome of the other performances are adequate, even good. The 2nd Movement (The \"Elvira Madigan\") of the Mozart Concerto, the Barber Adagio, are fine. This is studio music, and it seems as if some of the more familiar pieces were fobbed off in a hurry to get them onto a recording. I used to sing choral music with the occasional orchestra, and when musicians are on the clock, sometimes you don't rehearse a more familiar piece and just show up to the performance and have at it. Perhaps that's what happened here. Ok, people, you all know Beethoven's Fifth. Let's go.\n\nHowever, it's five dollars, in fact, not even, so it's worth putting up with some of the pieces sounding awful in exchange for a lot of good listening. I may delete the offending works from the playlist.","classification":4,"fold":4}

Before deciding to form his own group in 1966 Sylvester Sly Stone Stewart (lead singer, keyboards) had been producing records for other people including Bobby Freeman and the Beau Brummels. During the late 60s and early 70s the group would have 5 Top Ten hits three of which went all the way to #1. But my personal favorite was the breezy 1969 hit Hot Fun In The Summertime.

{"text":"Mary J. Blige returns with her eighth studio album, \"Growing pains\". I've been a fan of hers ever since she burst onto the scene singing about \"Real love\". Sixteen years later, she's still as strong as ever; \"Growing pains\" became her fourth US chart topping album and has sold over a million so far. It's the latest instalment in a musical journey, which intentionally or not has chronicled the state of her life at the time of each release.\n\nThis is no different. Very much in love (with her husband and with herself), the songs reflect this. From lead-off single, the upbeat joyous hand-clap filled \"Just fine\" where she states she's just that, thank you (from the same team that gave Rihanna her chart \"raining\" hit \"Umbrella\"), opening cut \"Work that\" (a song of female self belief\/assertion no matter what you look like, lovely song), the more sparse guitar driven \"Grown woman\" (with Ludacris), There is a bit to dance to. \"Roses\" is an angry mid tempo song with unsettling beats (where you wouldn't want to mess with her; she's having one of them days), and closing cut \"Come to me (peace)\" is a lovely song with a hypnotic throbbing bassline and a pop feel (Love it!).\n\nFor ballads, we have just about everything else, with lyrics dealing with unabashed love,  or vulnerability; \"Shake down\" (a duet with Usher), \"Feel like a woman\", \"Stay down\", \"Hurt again\" (lovely harmonies), the string swathed \"What love is\", \"Work in progress (growing pains)\" (with autobiographical lyrics, the title says it all), \"Talk to me\" (where she's trying to rekindle conversation in the relationship), the piano sprinkled \"If you love me\", and the pseudo jazz feel of \"Smoke\" (with a slightly off kilter beat).\n\nMy favourite cut is her song about wanting to get away from it all when things get tough; \"Fade away\", a dreamy plodding mid-tempo number (a bit like \"Everything\" from \"Share my world\") with soothing harmonies. It's like sailing on a calm sea. Outstanding!\n\nMary has been on an upward tangent ever since the day she appeared on the scene, a tangent that shows no sign of dipping any day soon.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Arcade Fire burst onto the scene in 2004 with their debut album, Funeral.  Their grandiose indie anthems earned them glowing praise from critics and fans alike.  With Win Butler leading on vocals and guitar, Arcade Fire's eclectic instrumentation and apparent influences, including David Bowie, Bruce Springsteen, Radiohead, and Neil Young, made them stand out from the countless indie bands getting their start at the same time.\n\nRecording their second album in a church, Neon Bible utilized a pipe organ, full orchestra and military choir to expand their sound even further.  Although the mood of Neon Bible was much darker than the soul cleansing shouts of hope that burst through the depression on the surface of Funeral, Arcade Fire proved they were much more than a one off talent.  A packed tour schedule consumed the band's time until early 2008 when the members decided to take a break, playing a few free shows later in the year in support of Barack Obama's presidential candidacy, but ultimately staying out of the public eye.\n\nNow, two years later, Arcade Fire is finally back with one of the most anticipated albums of 2010.  Their third record opens with the title track, \"The Suburbs,\" which finds Arcade Fire in significantly lighter spirits than their previous two records.  The same band looking for an escape from the pains of life realized in their earlier years is now beginning to accept the conformity of suburbia with a new goal of providing their children with the best experiences life has to offer, safe from the agony they had to work through.\n\nThere is still, however, an internal conflict hidden within the band's acceptance of The Suburbs.  On \"Ready To Start,\" an energetic verse proclaiming \"I would rather be wrong than live in the shadows of your song\" shows the classic break-away mindset of Arcade Fire shining through while the following track, \"Modern Man,\" brings the pace back down to the mid-tempo groove and finds Win Butler repeating \"I'm a modern man\" as if he's trying to convince the listener of something he doesn't quite believe himself yet.  The musical mood swings continue as laid back tracks like \"Rococo\" and \"Wasted Hours\" are given \"Empty Room\" and \"Month of May,\" two of the most animated tracks on the album, as neighbors.  Although, on first listen, this pitting of tunes against each other may cause the album to seem sporadic, on further listens, the sheer genius of the track ordering and songwriting as a whole rings out.\n\nThe apex of the album occurs during \"Suburban War.\"  The realization of inevitable maturity begins to be accepted as Butler's earlier cry of \"I would rather be wrong than live in the shadows of your song\" becomes \"I've been living in the shadows of your song.\"  The truth comes out, denial becomes acceptance and the song's tempo doubles as the line \"all my old friends, they don't know me now\" is hauntingly repeated.\n\nThe Suburbs finds Arcade Fire taking a longing look at the naivety of their youth while looking forward to what the future holds.  Where their first two albums leaned heavily on stand out singles like \"Wake Up,\" \"Rebellion,\" \"Keep the Car Running,\" and \"Intervention,\" The Suburbs is much more of a complete work meant to be taken in as a single, hour long journey between adolescence and adulthood.  Longtime fans of Arcade Fire will always hold Funeral on a pedestal, untouchable by future releases, but just as children often grimace at being compared to their parents, The Suburbs is a masterpiece worthy of such an analogy.\n\nSimilar Artists:  Talking Heads, Pixies\nTrack Suggestion:  \"Suburban War\"","classification":5,"fold":4}

Invincible, Someday, were just feeble and the lyrics were not only generic, but pretty embarrassing and pathetic.\n\nNow, I can listen to this album, and mildly enjoy it.

{"text":"Although Lucinda Williams has been doing her thing for almost thirty years, it seems that she didn't really get a WHOLE lot of attention until she released Car Wheels on a Gravel Road in 1998. That album was so influential that it seems that all of her albums after that point will be compared to it, which might account for all the negative reviews for her latest album, West.\n\nActually, now that I think about it, this is another one of those cases where I looked at the one-star reviews and now I'm wondering if those are the kind of reviewers that think one star and five stars are the only options. But if this is your first Lucinda Williams album, I suggest you get educated on some of her earlier material first. She doesn't sound different or anything, but, well, Lucinda is another one of those singers that makes great songs yet she doesn't have a great voice, so if you're not a fan of hers, this album might put you to sleep. But it really IS very accessible.\n\nLucinda composed this album following the death of her mother, which is probably why most of the songs are mellow. They don't drown into each other though, as I can easily pick up highlights like \"Are You Alright\", \"Learning How to Live\" and the title track. And the songs about her mother are poignant yet exceptional, as shown in \"Mama You Sweet\" and especially \"Fancy Funeral\". But my favorite song would probably have to be \"Words\".\n\nWhile I can do without \"Come On\" and the nine-minute spoken word \"Wrap My Head Around That\", the rest of the album is quality Lucinda. It might not be her best album, but it's far above-average, so if you want to find exceptional music, go west.\n\nAnthony Rupert","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Alice Cooper's 1982 \"Zipper Catches Skin\" is more straight-ahead rock and less New Wave than his two previous albums, but contains some material that seems like leftovers from \"Flush the Fashion\" and \"Special Forces\".\n\nIt's an average Alice album at best, and if you skip this one you're not missing that much.\n\nThe best cuts are the galloping opener \"Zorro's Ascent\"; The fiery, clever \"Tag, You're It\" has Alice assuming the role of horror-movie director and the entire song is made up of his direction to the terrified leading lady hiding from a psycho-killer. It alone makes this album worth getting. Though the militant \"I Better Be Good\" sounds like a leftover from \"Special Forces\", it's still one of the best tracks here lyrically and musically. Patty Donahue of The Waitresses appears to take Alice to task on \"I Like Girls\" and her asides are typically amusing and make the song (\"What happened? Run out of gas?\" etc).\n\nAmong the rest: \"Make That Money (Scrooge's Song)\" is nothing special except the instrumental finale sounds like something straight out of the \"Killer\" era, which should please fans of the original ACG. In the slower \"I Am the Future\", Alice forgoes the sap of earlier shamaltz for a ballad with bite--exactly like a slow Coop song should be.\n\nSome of the lyrics get a little silly, as on \"No Baloney Homosapiens\" but it's a decent sing-a-long cut nontheless, the showy chorus reminiscent of \"Hello Hurray\". The rocking \"I'm Alive (That Was the Day My Dead Pet Returned)\" also sounds like something from B$B updated for 1982.\n\n\"Adaptable (Anything For You)\", \"Remarkably Insincere\" are actually both UNremarkable.\n\nAlthough \"Zipper Catches Skin\" is not a bad album--and would be decent for any other artist, Alice is capable of much more than what's here.\n\nThree Stars--an average Coop effort.","classification":3,"fold":4}

Shades of Jackson show up again in the finger-snap driven ballad \"Know Your Name\" and the upbeat \"Cause I Said So\". \"Crazy Love\" features Fabolous, and with its languid feel and quivering guitars has echoes of Lauryn Hill.\n\nOther standouts are the midtempo \"Makin' A Movie\" and \"One In A Million\", the StarGate-produced swirling trancey Dance number \"Beautiful Monster\" (a UK no. 1 hit) with lovely layered harmonies (reminiscent of Rihanna's \"Russian Roulette which he co-wrote), and the beautiful falsetto-sung ballad \"What Have I Done?\" (think \"I Can't Help It\" by Michael Jackson.

The lyrics are so beautiful as well as meaningful that they can bring tears to your eyes, if you are in the right frame of mind. The music too matches the lyrics, in that, it too is beautiful. It far outstrips Candle in the Wind, for beauty. It is a song about giving God Thanks, for certain people in his life, that have changed the person's life for the better, no matter what happened to the contrary. It is truly a work of art. Elton was definitely inspired when he wrote this. It will be forever on the top of my all time favorite songs of all time list. I would suggest that you buy it. At least, give a good listen. Maybe a second and a third, until you can hear all the words clearly. He sings things like \"I know why roses don't grow in New York\" and other things like that you probably aren't expecting. Just buy the song and let it enrich your life. The words alone could be a poem to people we love; who make a difference in our lives. A complete and utter dedication to them - those loved ones.

However, I would not say that this album has another \"Cough Syrup\" on it by any means. There are most certainly tracks on here that are catchy and enjoyable but then begins the big problem I have with this record. It's electronic sound. You can tell the band is jumping onto the New Wave electronic bandwagon that every other Indie artist is going towards nowadays. Some artists do this transition well but I can't say Young The Giant makes this transition 100%. On a track like 'Something To Believe In\" I would say it's done relatively well but on others it sounds cringeworthy and like you're listening to a side project of the group than actual Young The Giant. Despite this, if you're a big fan of the group you'll find some enjoyment here but don't expect the same quality like the result of their self-titled debut.","classification":3,"fold":4}

Though she never did hit it big she did have a pair of modest hits including 1964's \"Every Little Bit Hurts\" as well as this Smokey Robinson penned number \"When I'm Gone\" which peaked at #25 in April 1965. I thought she had a terrific voice. Years later she would be employed as a backup singer for the great Joe Cocker. This is probably one of those songs that you have heard but had no idea who sang it.","classification":4,"fold":4}
{"text":"I am so glad I spent my money on Sevendust's latest release, Cold Day Memory, because it is so well put together. Every song on here follows two things: to be ridiculously creative and heavy, or to be soft and melodic, and being completely original when coming up with guitar riffs. Despite having a very distracting squeal at the beginning, Splinter is an otherwise excellent way to kick off the album, with a very sweet guitar lick, and some fantastic vocals by Lajon. Other standouts include album highlight \"Confessions (Without Faith)\", The End Is Coming, Better Place (which is reminiscent of Killswitch Engage's hit The End Of Heartache), and Here and Now. Overall, this is right up there with Animosity and Seasons.\n\nRating: 4.5 stars\/5 stars","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Although not an expert on Bechet's remarkable carreer, I have heard quite a few of his recordings over the years and I think these are among the best; avoiding his French phase in favor of his American roots...\n\nAnd he really diggs into the tunes; his company is mostly fine or more than fine, varying widely (it includes Louis Armstrong, Clarence Williams, Tommy Ladnier, Ernie Caceres, Muggsy Spanier, Zutty Singleton, Henry \"Red\" Allen, Sidney De Paris, \"Pops\" Foster) and I must admit I had no idea Noble Sissle's band was this good).\nWell, even if the selection could have been better, this is a great intro to Bechet's soprano-sax and clarinet opus from 1923-1947; the earliest recording being Waller-Williams' \"Wild Cat Blues\" performed by Clarence Williams Blue Five (Bechet, Thomas Morris on cornet, John Mayfield on trombone, Williams on piano and Buddy Christian on banjo) and the latest being Porter's \"Love for Sale\" performed by Bechet's Quartet (with Lloyd Philips on piano, \"Pops\" Foster on bass and Arthur Herbert on drums).","classification":5,"fold":4}

I was watching Good Morning America hoping to see the Indy 4 trailer, and then I saw her. The most amazing...Singer I'd ever seen. Amazing doesn't even begin to describe her. I mean...WOW! Let's just say, it's better if you watch her on the TV.\n\nBut, then I heard the song on radio again, and then my eyes and heart were open. Here was an honest, sweet, unconventional, amazing love song. I mean, are there enough adjectives to describe this song? Probably not, I mean, who writes lyrics like,\"I buy you Rogaine, when you start losing all your hair.\" I mean, it's perfect. More than perfect even. The verses are stunning, and the chorus will blow you out of your seat. I mean, does music get any better?\n\nOverall, this might be the greatest song of all time, by an amazing artist with such talent, skill and mastery. Simply put, BUY THIS SONG!!! And while you're at it, watch her music video, go to her website [...] and support her work!\n\nNote: Although this probably makes no difference, I used to run a now defunct blog that had a shrine to her, but I'm not partial at all to her.\n\nNote to Amazon Technical Staff: Before your MP3 section is taken off technical \"beta,\" make sure songs don't disappear, then reappear, and make sure reviews aren't \"eaten\" when this does happen.

{"text":"Now What?! is the nineteenth full-length studio album by the legendary British Rock band Deep Purple, it was their third studio album with Don Airy on Keyboards and their fifth with Steve Morse on guitar. It was produced by Bob Ezrin and released in 2013.\n\nOn very first listen, a lot of the album washed over me, leaving a generally positive, but honestly not too impressed or interested impression. With repeat listens however, it revealed itself to be not only a passable, or even above average affair, but a genuinely good one, with literally no weak tracks. It's a grower for sure.\n\nUsually, I really enjoy any Deep Purple album, and have enjoyed most Morse era albums to some extent, however sometimes they can feel like there is a bit of filler, or there's a minor lack of consistency, stopping the albums feeling as great as the old days even when over half the album has some genuinely great songs. Now What?! is the perfect Morse era album, it all fits perfectly together, there's variety yet consistency and all the songs are as good as the very best tracks on another Morse era album.\n\nHighlights include the symphonic `Uncommon Man' dedicated to the late Jon Lord, which feels like a mixture between Close To The Edge era Yes with Works era ELP, the energetic and memorable `Apres Vous' which has a very catchy chorus, and the interesting and characterful single `Vincent Price' although to be honest its all great.\n\nThe only real negative thing I can think to say is that the track order may undersell the album's both power and variety. I listen to this record a lot but I often choose to listen to the record on random\/shuffle now, and always find it a great and exciting album all the more for having done so, but that's just personal preference, most people have no problems with that running order. Seriously, it's a great album; the rhythm section are tight and steady, Airy and Morse make a real impact and Ian Gillan fits into his older vocal style more comfortably here than ever.\n\nOverall; Now What?! is a very good album from the veteran Rock band, easily in the top fifty percent of their catalogue. It's a well produced and well written collection of interesting songs, with a great sense of subtly, musicianship and even a few surprises. Check it out if you like Deep Purple, and especially if you've liked their modern output. And if you do check it out, don't just listen to it once, give it a good few spins and really let it sink in, you'll thank yourself for it after a while.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"For most bands your second album is supposed to be something respectable to follow up the cd that got your name out there.  For Lifehouse the sophomore release Stanley Climbfall establishes the group as one of the most prolific of this age.  Coming off a multi platinum cde and the most played single so far this millenium, you might expect a let down.  But Lifehouse has taken things to a new level, a place that doesn't settle for the shallowness and mediocrity of modern music. Every song 1 - 14 is as good as a song can get. A feat so amazing its hard to believe its the second straight album in which it has been accomplished by the same artist.  With as good as No name Face was it is hard to believe the marked improvement that lifehouse has shown. The instrumentation on this cd is far superior to that of the first release, And Jason Wade has established himself as one of the most profound songwriters in the world.  If you do not buy this cd you would being doing yourself and everyone else a disservice. Tracks like Take me away, Sky is falling, and Anchor are sure to please any ear.

{"text":"I hesitate to call \"Black and Blue\" the beginning of the end for The Rolling Stones creatively, but it certainly does not ascend to the lofty heights of their 1968-72 output, nor is it even quite as good as \"Goat's Head Soup\" or \"It's Only Rock 'N' Roll,\" neither of which were masterpieces but were respectably solid efforts.\n\n\"Black and Blue\" was a transitional record for the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World. Mick Taylor, widely considered their best ever guitarist and a driving force behind their peak creative period, had left the band shortly after recording \"It's Only Rock 'n' Roll\" in 1974, and the next few months were spent searching for a new guitarist to fill what was a major musical void for the group. Candidates included Harvey Mandel (who actually plays on several tracks on \"B&B\") and even Eric Clapton, but the role wound up going to former Faces member Ron Wood, who joined the band in time for their 1975 tour.\n\n\"Black and Blue\" is one of their most experimental records as well, though that's not necessarily for the better in some cases. Funk and reggae were becoming major movements at the time, and Mick was especially swept up in it. Several of the album's tracks boast his fixation with the genres, but they unfortunately drag the album down in most instances. The opening number \"Hot Stuff,\" is built around a pleasant enough riff by Mandel and has a pretty catchy rhythm including some fine piano work, but lyrically it's the same chorus repeated over and over again followed by a sequence of Mick spouting out Jaggerisms in an embarassing faux Jamaican accent. This schtick is revisiting a few times throughout the record, most noticably the dreadful \"Cherry Oh Baby\" and the odd reggae \/ punk hybrid \"Hey Negrita.\"\n\nThe album's better tracks are worthy of recognition. \"Hand of Fate\" is a solid, gritty Stones rocker, as well as the most genuinely traditional Stones sounding track on the entire album. Mick delivers a punchy vocal and the band is well oiled and rocking. \"Memory Motel\" and the hit single \"Fool to Cry\" are both uncharacteristic, keyboard drenched power ballads that work better than they should considering their sappiness; the former has some great contributions from Keith on the bridge while the latter has Mick making great use of his falsetto. Finally, \"Melody\" is a playful, jazz infused number reminiscent of the previous album's \"Short and Curly.\"\n\n\"Black and Blue\" is by no means a masterpiece, and does indeed the first taste of the Stones past their peak, but there are enough good moments on it to make it a worthwhile listen.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"Cincinnati-based Walk the Moon released their debut album for RCA two years ago and followed that with an even better EP in early 2013 called \"Tightrope\". After endless touring, the guys finally have recorded a new album. After a first single in September (\"Shut Up and Dance\"), now comes the second single, just weeks ahead of the new album's release.\n\n\"Different Colors\" (3'17\") is the sophomore single of the upcoming album, and this is pure 'classic' WTM sound. The band sounds like they're having fun, and the song makes you want to get up and sing along, in particular when the chorus comes on: \"Say uh uh uh uh\/Different colors\/Uh uh uh uh\/We paint each other\", ha! Who even would want to resist that? Note: the body-painting theme, so prominent in the band's early days, seems to have returned (at least in the lyrics). Bottom line: this seems to indicate more fun times are coming our way on WTM's upcoming second album for RCA, \"Talking Is Hard\", which is due for release in early December..\n\nYou haven't had the full experience of Walk the Moon if you haven't seen them in concert. Being in Cincinnati, I've seen them plenty of times over the years. Most recently, they played here in August on the \"Gospel\" tour along with Panic! At the Disco, and they blew up the roof, once again. Then they presented two new songs, \"Shut Up and Dance\", and the Talking Heads-influenced \"Spend Your $$$\", which are both on the new album. Can't wait for that. Meanwhile, \"Different Colors\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":4}

So I have placed it on my INSTRUMENTAL playlist!\n\nHighly recommend this song.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"This is a very cool album. Jewel has been taking a lot of heat for it and I don't really see what all of the fuss is about. It's not really all that different from the direction she had seemed to be taking with \"This Way.\" Remember \"Serve the Ego?\" Remember \"Standing Still?\" The tracks from \"0304\" aren't all that different. The production is just taken up a notch. Obviously Jewel has done something right because of the first single \"Intuition\" has become her biggest radio hit since \"Hands\" back in '98.\n\"Inuition\" is definitely one of the star tracks of the album. Jewel has taken her lyrics and put them to a great pop beat and sound. \"Run 2 U\" is a stand-out also and is very catchy. My personal favorite *at least as of now* is \"Fragile Heart.\" It's a light-hearted ballad and would make a great single. This is the Jewel I love! *who couldn't love that whistle?* \"Leave the Lights On\" and \"Haunted\" are the most unique songs and have a love\/hate style about them. If you liked \"Standing still\" from \"This Way\" then you'll probably like \"Doin' Fine.\" \"Yes U Can\" is definitely another potential single. Like \"Intuition,\" it's a dance track *originally written for Santana* but I'm glad Jewel got to do it. This would be a great club single. \"2 Become 1\" is a love song similar to the title track from \"This Way.\" It's a beautiful song as are all of Jewel's love songs. \"Yes U Can\" is another fun dance track. \"America\" is a more serious track with some ear-catching lyrics.\nDon't knock Jewel for wanting to lighten up and experiment with her music. True fans would respect her for wanting to try different styles. And who cares about her image change? So she's wearing a dress...get over it! She's hot, let her have her fun. The music's great. As far as her comparisons to the newly reformed teen divas, Jewel's talent in all its aspects *vocals, lyrics, song-writing*  makes them look like Milli Vanilli wannabes. Well done Jewel!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"After the unprecedented success of \"Hanging By A Moment,\" Lifehouse took the genre they inevitably bore and ran with it. The result is a follow-up forever foreshadowed by the success of its predecessor, but arguably tops it. Taking a heavy-dose from the grunge genre, Lifehouse all but nixes any acoustic or poppy elements from their sound, as it all takes a very raw, rough, but rockin' turn instead. I personally love every moment of it, as it's on the edge, and it's almost one long consistent jam session that the band really ran and had fun with.\n\nStandout tracks include \"Spin,\" \"Sky Is Falling,\" \"Stanley Climbfall,\" and the highlight\/album-definer \"Take Me Away.\"\n\nOverall, on a recent list I made of the top 15 albums in Christian music, I placed this particular work at #9, saying \"If 'No Name Face' bore modern rock as we know it, then \"Stanley Climbfall\" perfected it. It's still one of the most consistent records I've ever heard.\" Well, that pretty much sums it up. It's highly controversial, especially since this album has been largely forgotten, but it is a true masterpiece in the genre of modern rock. Sure, 'No Name Face' has the moving work of \"Everything,\" but 'Stanley Climbfall' has the consistency and the driving \"Take Me Away.\" I still am however confused about the title.

{"text":"I absolutely love this CD. This is great funky blues entertainment.\n\nI read...\n\n\"Luther Allison gave his son some of the greatest gifts a father can give a son. He gave him a comfortable home environment filled with the music that inspired his career and he taught him what he knew about his art. Bernard has a new album, Chills & Thrills, that proves eleven years after Dad's death that the Allison legacy is indeed intact and that, while he performs some of his dad's songs, Bernard Allison has indeed found his own voice.\"...Don Wilcock, Blueswax\n\nHis latest effort, which was recorded in New Hope, Minnesota in the autumn of 2007, he's joined by Eric Gales on second guitar, Rusty Hall on keyboards, Jassen Wilber on bass and Mario Dawson on drums. Guests: Bruce McCabe (piano, clavinet), Kathleen Johnson (background vocals), Jose James (sax)\n\nBernard is a rocker at heart but he can also slow it down from time to time and burn a ballad or two. He had many different musical influences while growing up, including Albert King, Muddy Waters and Freddie King, and later, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Johnny Winter. Bernard and Eric deliver some high quality riffing on this release and are comfortable trading back and forth on each new groove that is spun.\n\nThis disc confirms that Bernard Allison is doing his father proud and has become one of the few bluesmen whose every release is worth a listen. Funky, raw and full of \"Chills and Thrills\". Five stars easily.","classification":5,"fold":4}

The quality of the mastering is far superior than previous compilations including that of the earlier hits from Motown...like I Want You Back, ABC and Got To Be There. The track information is informative and I don't recall another compilation that has such details.\n\n  But the reason for the 1 less star is that it did not complete the Essential and added 2 songs that were not Essential for this type of CD.

But, unfortunately, their latest ballad, I Hate This Part, the second single from their sophmore album, Doll Domination, doesn't seem to hit the nail on the head. I really felt the melody, but the lyrics itself were really a turnoff. It just didn't seem to click when it came to the mends of a breakup, the dolls knew what they were singing. They needs to do better ballads, but they also need better singles. The next single from Doll Domination should be better than this.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":4}

{"text":"The Decemberists have a new \"album\". They took a break a bit ago, as multi-instrumentalist Jenny Conlee battled some health issues. But they're back with 'What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World' (which is really hard to get on the CD case binding, I suppose).\n\nLike with any band or disk - there is good and bad. And with any band that has an ok output of music, you start to see their talent or limits (or both). The problem with the Decemberists seem to be, no matter how much they attempt to stretch, they don't quite seem to sound that much different from their other works. That's not a bad thing for folks who like continuity, but\n\n\"The Singer Addresses His Audience\".  The music and pace is great. They lyrics? meh.  Like I need songs with product placement (really? Axe shampoo???) or talking about someone copying their drummer's hair style. Yes, I get it is a piece on criticism but save it for your Rolling Stone interview.\n\nI wasn't sure what to think about the intro to \"Calvary Captain\", but then it took off and it seemed to work, with a '60s vibe, though I attribute that to the horns. The background vocals that repeat the main vocal are not stellar - almost cheesy in fact. If those were taken out, the song is actually better than good.\n\nMore '60s tendencies with \"Philomena\", but for me the tempo or cadence was just off. 'Skip' on my player seems to be used on this song far too often. I'm also ok on skipping \"Better Not Wake the Baby\".\n\n\"Till the Water's All Gone\" is a moody piece that I find getting lost in and letting it play repeatedly. Possibly the best piece on the disk.\n\nLiking \"Carolina Low\" too. It's almost a John Paul White song, but it works. It's more Americana than it should be, but I really like it. And \"Easy Come, Easy Go\"is good, but it's not too far of a stretch to hear someone like Raul Malo tackle this song...and do a better job of it.\n\nI like \"Make You Better\", but it seems to be trying a little to hard to be radio friendly - not that there is anything wrong with that, if they tried that more consistently, it would be a good thing, But the rest of their material, they seem to go against that grain on purpose, which makes songs like \"Make You Better\" stand out like a sore thumb.\n\nThe rest of the songs are fine, but nothing that stand-out.\n\nI get that many did not like 'the King is Dead', but I really dug that whole disk. And I get that some did not appreciate Gillian Welch being so prominent on those songs, but I thought she was the perfect person to be there - and that pairing made the group and the songs better.\n\n'What a Terrible World...'  is fine, but it's not going down in the annals of recorded history as being one of the great disks. The group has done better. I get that it is Colin Meloy is the leader, singer, and songwriter of the ensemble, but it might not hurt to get other influences in there - to mix it up, because things are sounding too much the same.","classification":3,"fold":4}

Yet, I did honestly find it very hard to hear them trying to sample Five For Fighting's classic Superman, which was widely played at the time of 9\/11. Also adding Bruno Mars into the mix makes it also lose a lot of its sheen and shine.

For your enemies.  This song is about watching them fall from grace. When everyone else finds out what you already knew, that they are a low life, back stabbing, user, and that feeling you get when you see their world of lies crumble around them. Watching as everyone around them that they've burned, turns on them.

'Notions astir' too has a lot of sparks of enlightenment- like ideas springing up, leading to a bit of confusion and doubt sometimes but flourishing in the end...just as one goes through when the spark of an idea has to be taken through to realisation   Fantastic music!!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"It has been a very long time since we've heard anything fresh and outrageous from the legendary Queen Of Soul, Aretha Franklin. She has not made any new music for years. So when I had heard she was making a attempt to make new music again, I was very skeptical to hear her sound, and honestly she just doesn't have it at heart in her voice. Her cover of the mega-hit from Adele Rolling In The Deep, really isn't as outrageous and dynamic as when Adele recorded the song several years ago. It actually feels a bit weak, and Aretha doesn't really deliver at making the song her own. Hopefully, when Aretha's next album comes out soon, there will be better songs that can make her own, just like the way her late goddaughter did with music, the great Whitney Houston. We'll see if Aretha has more than Rolling In The Deep showed from her.\n\nSong: C 1\/2-","classification":3,"fold":4}

I only wished later that I had waited one more month so I could have gotten the next model up with the hot shoe for the flash (say wha? What's a hot shoe, man?).  What a beat this song has! What a hook this song has! Mama did not take Paul's Kodachrome away (the absolute best and truest color rendering slide film there ever was even though it was the most expensive and slowest ASA speed).  Kodak itself took it away after the digital camera appeared on the scene. Sigh. I upgraded the Minolta camera to another film camera in the mid 80s. I still do not like digital cameras. Have you ever used one between 9 am and 4 pm in the desert on a day with NO clouds? Or outside anywhere during a bright day when there are NO clouds? The LCD viewing screen cannot handle that sun! The LCD screen one the camera I have now is difficult to see in sunlight. The screen on my cellphone is difficult to see in sunlight.

The latter would make the song more powerful in a lyrical sense, the former on the other hand, would just make the song wrong all the world around. But, in either case, Clarkson does a poor vocal performance here, and somebody totally messed up on giving this song a tune. It's so bad, it verges on mind-numbing, and annoying. And after you've heard the song ten times on radio, in the same morning, you'll verge on convulsions and other serious medical and mental issues. Yes, it's that bad.\n\nOh by the way, Reba didn't help the song any. In fact, she just made it worse, as if that was even possible.

{"text":"I think I mostly bought this song because I heard Lady Gaga's Applause, and it really lowered my expectations for Katy Perry.  However, Katy Perry's song was better than Applause lyrically.  She's talking about herself in a way that we can also talk about ourselves somewhat comfortably.  IF I had to choose between singing out loud \"I got the eye of the tiger... cause I am a Champion and you're gonna hear me Roar\" and \"I live for the applause, the way that you scream and cheer for me\" I would choose Roar hands down.  Personally I have realized both of these songs are arrogant, and boastful; it's boosting their egos, etc. However with Katy Perry's song, it is so much easier and more comfortable to sing because you could easily tie into motivating yourself to do better, and to let the world hear you Roar... Lady Gaga's song is all about getting attention, and how she lives for it... I would not feel comfortable singing that song. In fact, when I listen to it I sing \"I've given up on my career\" over the background vocal \"A P P L A U S E\" because that's kind of what I think Lady Gaga has done... BUT at the same time I can see this song being sort of a way poking fun of pop culture, and pop idols, artists, etc; that this is what most artists might as well be singing because a lot of celebrities are probably secretly arrogant. So if that is the case with Applause, then I applaud Lady Gaga for it, if she wrote it about herself to boost her ego... well I'm still not buying her single either way.  I am a huge gaga fan so that speaks on so many levels.\n\nI actually bought Roar, and not Applause, simply because the chorus speaks to me more on a normal social level, and I could sing it more comfortably in a car, or on my bike or in a store.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Thank you England.  Alex Clare's THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR is the best debut I've heard since Of Monster and Men's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/MY-HEAD-IS-AN-ANIMAL\/dp\/B007MU85D0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MY HEAD IS AN ANIMAL<\/a>.  Now, I know that both of these albums were released in 2012, but hey, I can't help it if it's been a good year for music.  Regardless of how good the year has been, British singer\/songwriter Alex Clare's debut album is pretty fantastic.  Originally released overseas in 2011, it's proving to be one of 2012's most successful and interesting debuts.\n\nAt this point, Clare is most famous for his song appearing in a commercial.  The lead single \"Too Close\" has been featured in Microsoft's Internet Explorer 9 advertisement. Unfortunately for Microsoft, the attention that the commercial seems to be gaining is more due to the music than the actual advertisement.  The song is quite characteristic of the album in many ways: the focus is on Clare's lyrics and soulful vocals.  The melody is at the forefront of the song -- the electronic and dubstep instrumentation takes a backseat to the melody.  Opening track \"Up All Night\" uses a tribal and rhythmic chant to propel it through its running time; it's one of the hardest hitting tracks on the album.  \"Treading Water\" sounds similar to \"Too Close,\" -- the dubstep influence is certainly clear -- but it's a great song in its own right.  \"Hands Are Clever\" serves as a highlight for me; it's a track that flirts with R&B instrumentation and shoots for the moon with its catchy hook.  The final track \"I Won't Let You Down\" is probably the most traditional of the tracks here.  It's composed of Clare's vocals and an accompanying piano; it's a bare and organic ending to an album that feels slickly produced.\n\nWhat bounds Clare's album together is his intense and soulful vocal delivery.  I would recommend THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR to listeners interested in alternative music -- there's plenty of material here for people to love.  The album is an incredibly enjoyable listen that proves to be remarkably consistent.  Essential tracks to sample\/download: \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Too-Close\/dp\/B007VF2PAA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Too Close<\/a>,\" \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Hands-Are-Clever\/dp\/B007VF2QJA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hands Are Clever<\/a>,\" and \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Up-All-Night\/dp\/B007VF2MIK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Up All Night<\/a>.\"  Don't miss out on this album.","classification":5,"fold":4}

We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic.

{"text":"You're ascending the escalator when the gleam of a sparkling new appliance captures your eye. Your heart flutters as you make your way past bedding and home decor to get a closer glimpse of that modern kitchen marvel. And this was the music that was playing as you ascended the escalator.\n\nThis is not jazz, it's easy listening music, muzak for the 21st century. Although such music often endures scorn, there is a need for sounds such as these. This collection accomplishes the goals of wallpaper music very well. To be sure, this is not foreground music, but there's nothing wrong with that. The performances are tasteful and avoid any flair that would make them tasty, bringing them to foreground awareness. It bears the name \"latin\" but don't expect to hear the mysterious dark-eyed flamenco player from that favorite small restaurant with tables for two.\n\nAs muzak goes, these are not the kind of latin-tinged instrumentals one would use for a romantic night of seduction and bliss; this lends itself more toward what you might hear as you were testing perfumes or colognes at the big mall prior to that night. Unlike '50s shopping music there isn't a stitch of humor or playfulness to be found here but that isn't a requirement; I'm just clarifying the style of ersatzia under which this falls.\n\nYou might find this more engaging than the sax-driven formula popularized as \"the wave\" or \"lite jazz\". That warhorse seems to have run its course, leaving room for new options such as this.

{"text":"When it has came down to what made Michael Jackson a real legend is the real rhythm into what made his songs definitive. But after his passing in 2009, it has been very hard for anyone to try and ignite what made Michael Jackson one of the most definitive artists of all time. When Love Never Felt So Good came out, it handled fairly well as a throwback to the sound of Michael's early work with Thriller and Off The Wall. Wish I could say abut Slave To The Rhythm, the second single from the posthumous Xscape album. The song tries to bring in a futuristic sound to his music. Sadly, I didn't find the song to deliver. It was just as lackluster as the songs Michael had recorded from the poorly sold Invincible album. If you are new to his music, I would definitely pass this song up, and go back to what made him the king of pop in the very first place.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"Paul Spaeth released his first album, a piano and orchestral CD called \"Cobalt Blue,\" in 2001, when he was still a teenager. At 17, he premiered his first orchestral piece and then entered the University of Southern Californias Thornton School of Music for composition and film scoring. Since then, he has written music for film, TV and video games as well as the eleven tracks for his new album, \"Redemption.\"  Composed over a ten-year period, \"Redemption\" expresses a young mans personal experiences of life and love, coming of age, and finding ones truth. Seven of the eleven tracks are solo piano and four feature Tina Guo on cello or Christopher Luther on violin. This intensely personal music has been described as soothing and healing (physical, emotional, and spiritual), but it is also simply great music expressed with deep passion and an exquisite piano touch. It gives me great hope for the future of music that young artists like Paul Spaeth can carry the torch and keep their music a pure art form rather than simply a business proposition. This is an amazing album and one I fully expect to be one of my favorites for the year.\n\n\"Redemption\" begins with A Lifetime Spent, a gorgeous piano solo that powerfully expresses a whole range of emotions with passion and intensity. Breathtaking! To Say Goodbye is much more introspective - a bit of musical soul-searching. I expected track 3 to be a piece about rain, but it is titled Reflections. A bit more abstract and free-form, it has a very haunting quality. Prelude to a Lullaby is a duet for piano and cello that provides a gentle massage for the soul. It segues into Lullaby for the Mending Heart, also for cello and piano, and just as relaxing as its Prelude. The Moment After is my favorite track. Very spare and subtle, it conveys so much with so little. Something profound has happened here, and the music expresses tremendous loss and longing - and a naked, personal truth. A New Beginning lightens the mood considerably with feelings of hope and the anticipation of a fresh start. The melody is simple, but sincere and honest. I really like this one, too! Amazing Grace follows as a duet for violin and piano. Very slow and earthy, this well-worn nugget shines as brand new. Passage can mean many things, but in this case, the piece is almost celebratory with a gospel tinge, gathering energy as it evolves and ending with excitement and perhaps triumph. This Is Our Faith is a gorgeous duet for piano and cello, sharing deep from the heart and revealing the soul at its most honest and vulnerable. Incredibly moving and another favorite. The title track ends the album with a piece that is both dramatic and tender, again expressing a personal truth.\n\n\"Redemption\" is an emotional powerhouse, but is never over-the-top or overly sentimental. This is music that needs to be heard, and I hope to be able to spread the word to help give Paul Spaeth the audience he deserves. I give \"Redemption\" my highest recommendation!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Two Steps From Hell does it again, this time in the form of Miracles.\n\nRight off the bat you may notice something a little different about this album. There is no legendary battle score that's going to pump you up for your next movie trailer or duel to the death. It also features a lot more vocals from Merethe Soltvedt in a few tracks.\n\nThis is because Miracles is not the typical Two Steps high action soundtrack. It is in fact, a romantic and sentimental soundtrack.\n\nThere are many themes of love and remembrance in this album. In \"Men of Honor\" you cannot help but visualize the men and women who gave their lives to protect their country.\n\nIn \"Stay\" you're greeted with lyrics that signify what it is to be in love.\n\nBut don't be fooled, this is some of the finest romantic music I have heard in a long time. The songs in this album still illicit powerful images that could stir emotions you didn't think you would feel listening to music. In \"Eyes Closing\" you could see a ballet dancer performing for her family on the stage. Or you could interpret it differently and see it as a song of farewell and goodbye.\n\nThen you have \"Fountain of Life\" which starts off similar to an old school record player scratching the vinyl. The beats slowly build up into a song that creates in emotion in me, that I'm not sure I even know how to describe. It's almost . . . inspirational in that it gives me the confidence to focus my mind on my goals and strive for them.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, though this album may not have the epic trailer, combat music you've come to expect from Two Steps. It shouldn't be overlooked. The songs will stay with you long before the playlist has ended and is well worth the price of admission.\n\nDon't miss out on this beautiful and wonderful album.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Each one of these tracks on disc two have their own unique, quality that make them essential for Zevon fans BUT a couple are actually superior in their own way to the final versions. For example the plain demo and vocal version of \"The French Inhaler\" packs a wallop as does the solo piano version of \"Mohammed's Radio\". As with the \"Elton John\" two disc release that had demos on the second disc, this is one of those few albums that was great to begin with but has been improved by including these terrific alternate takes and solo demos. The band version of \"Carmelita\" captures the live vibe of how this sounded with a full band and I actually prefer it to the more somber reading on the original album (although both are exceptional). \"Frank and Jesse James\" is SO intimiate you can hear the helicopter that passes over Warren's home briefly at around the 3 minute mark.\n\nWarren Zevon considered this his debut but it was really his second solo album (\"Wanted: Dead or Alive\" was his first an album he really disliked). The cream of L.A. musicians appear on this terrific album. Zevon's vision focuses on the dark side of L.A. and America. \"Hasten Down the Wind\", \"Poor Poor Pitiful Me\" and \"Carmelita\" were all tackled by Linda Ronstandt on various albums and as great as her versions are they lack the bittersweet quality Zevon infuses in his versions. The original album sounds good--not great in this remaster. It's louder, more compressed than the original but fans will really be picking this up for the second disc out outtakes and alternate versions of the songs on disc one.\n\nThe track listing below represents what is on the second disc.\n\n1. Frank And Jesse James(Solo Piano Demo)\n2. The French Inhaler(Solo Piano Demo)\n3. Hasten Down The Wind(Band Demo)\n4. Carmelita(1974 Demo)\n5. Mohammed's Radio(Solo Piano Demo)\n6.

I still can't imagine who want to kill the peace-loving family man who helped usher and cultivate the greatest musc in the world? That shows that world that we live in today. Enough of the doom and gloom; the life's work of JMJ and his partners in crime Run D.M.C are among the most important in music history; they guided hip hop from something that New York kids did in the streets the biggest cultural revolution since the creation of rock and roll. Speaking\n\n of rock, rapping over heavy metal riffs? Gee, THAT will never catch on! That concept also furthered rock bands to incorporate rap into their miscial compisition, spawinig bands like Faith No More, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park and Korn among others. Though their star power diminshed through the '90's, their influence was overwhelming, such as groups like De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Salt N Pepa, Naughty By Nature and The Alkaholiks.

{"text":"The Lumineers sophomore recording has arrived after years of waiting.  Following their meteoric rise to popularity following the sensational self-titled debut album, one would imagine a second effort that reflects the pressure of a rising artist to replicate the formula of the record that put their name on the map.\n\nSigned to Dualtone Records, however, Cleopatra instead reflects an effort of a group of musicians who have taken their time to craft something real.  Indeed, some songs like Sleep on the Floor and Gun Song have been in The Lumineers repertoire for years  theyve been played live for almost as long as the band has existed, and are presented here in a more developed form.  Gale Song was recorded first a few years ago for the Hunger Games film franchise, and is re-recorded with more intense percussion by Jeremiah Fraites.\n\n(Of note, however, an unrecorded favorite of many fans  a duet between Wesley Schultz and Neyla Pekarek  has been omitted despite high hopes that it would appear on this recording.  A shame, as Neylas voice is quite brilliant and should be showcased, and fits well with Mr. Schultzs.  One might hope in future recordings that shes given time to use her vocals in addition to her talents on the cello.)\n\nThe sound is undeniably that of The Lumineers.  It is still music that is minimalist in its melodies and accessible in instrumentation, yet it packs a punch.  There is no foot-stomping, communal anthem like Ho Hey here, or catchy high-spirited storytelling like Submarines.  Rather, Cleopatra is decidedly more somber throughout.  While the debut was like a picture album, Cleopatra is more of a linear chapter book.  Schultzs vocals are given more reverberation, which is a production choice many listeners might prefer to dispense with (thought it does benefit certain tracks).  Neither, however, does the record reach the emotional depth of Stubborn Love, probably one of their greatest recorded songs to-date.  The songs on average are rather brief, and I could wish for these glimpses of emotion to fully develop the way Wes, Neyla, and Jeremiah allowed Stubborn Love, Dead Sea, or Charlie Boy to do so masterfully.\n\nThats not to say the songs on here fall short.  Rather, this album is more cohesive than the first, with a sustained pensive atmosphere.  In the Light, for example, starts out very simply, and instruments are layered, allowing the song to develop organically.  The new arrangement of Gale Song is probably one of the records biggest strengths.  It is definitely the most melodic of the bunch, and one might wish for a lengthier track that develops similarly to the Stubborn Love formula.\n\nLong Way from Home shows that Schultz can really write a melody.  It is a simple arrangement for voice an guitar, a song about human frailty and dying, presented in a triple-meter reminiscent of a marche funebre\/passacaile in the classical music tradition.\n\nThat track flows naturally into the following My Eyes with its waltz-like meter underscoring an opening melody reminiscent of Radioheads Creep.  This is one track that begins to show a little more harmonic complexity.  One might notice that this album features more of multi-instrumentalist bandmate Stelth Ulvang, and his contributions on piano offer a fuller sound, but with an improvisational quality.  Any fan who has seen them live will appreciate Ulvangs impressive skills at improvisation, and juxtaposed with the less is more approach to melody, his prominence in Cleopatra should become a welcome development in The Lumineers signature sound.\n\nCleopatra does not have the communal atmosphere of the first record, a quality that made their debut resonate with so many listeners.  I would say that the debut album is the stronger of the two  more inventive and packed with melodies that are more likely to stick in the mind.  The debut notwithstanding, this album stands well on its own.  In the genre, Cleopatra ranks up there this year on my list of favorites along with Parker Milksops The Very Last Day.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"There are really two songs on this disc that are not on the US version - 'You Take It All' and the Latin-flavoured 'The Look.' While this import may be a little expensive, 'The Look' is totally worth the extra cash. Unlike many of the other songs on this disc, 'The Look' does not contain a lot of computer enhanced effects, like the 100% techno number 'The Music's No Good Without You.' 'The Look' is set to a funky Flamenco beat that would have really gone over well as a single in the US. The lyrics may be light weight, but it's just so much fun to listen to! I don't pernsonally own the Japanese version of 'Living Proof,' but I have heard 'The Look' a number of times. If you love Cher and Spanish-influenced music, buy a copy of this import.

{"text":".\nCan we swim a lake by the ocean, Well be one like drops in slow motion. - Maxwell, Lake By The Ocean.\n\n(Courtesy of Amazon Prime Music)\nFive GROOVING Stars. From the 2016 album blackSummersnight, this is the Grammy Award-winning song by the double Grammy-winning singer, songwriter, musician, producer, and actor Maxwell. He has planned his musical career over long periods of time, followed by his eagerly-awaited albums becoming hits and spawning hit singles. Considering the significant gaps of time between them, up to 7 years, including 2 albums from the trilogy with variations of the words blacksummersnight, his artistry has shown bright throughout his career. This album was preceded by the 2009, Grammy-winning album, Blacksummersnight.\n\nOn Lake by The Ocean, written by Musze (Maxwell) and Hod David, which won the Grammy for Best R&B Song, Maxwell establishes a definite catchy groove that persists throughout the song and drives the simple, repetitive, but brilliant lyrics. Over a deliberate beat from the urgent drums, Maxwell uses his natural range voice to tell the story, switching to his falsetto voice range to raise the intensity with repetition of the refrain on this song. This song lingers in the mind long after the music has stopped. The musical support group includes the likes of Hod David on bass and other instruments, Robert Glasper on keyboards, Darryl Lil Man Howell or Mark Colenburg on drums, Derrick Hodge on bass, and others.

{"text":"As far as I could gather,Brandy Norwood was pretty much MIA following marriage and childbirth. Didn't blame her at all. Family,a living letter to the next generation,has to be the priority to my own way of thinking. At the same time? It was still an enormous surprise when during the winter of 2008 I heard the news that Brandy was releasing her first album in five years. She was an artist who had always maintained a strong connection to her roots and love of the popular musical continuum of black American artists. Considering the uncomfortable level of female solo artists attempting to follow in the footsteps of artists such as Mary J. Blige, Aaliyah and Brandy here? I really didn't know what to expect from this album. Wasn't sure then even what exactly I thought about the album. Time and that ever important second listen helped to make my mind up on this.\n\n  In the most basic terms? The bulk of this album is sliced up into three main musical categories. Following a spoken intro \"The Definition\",\"Warm It Up (With Love)\" and \"Right Here (Departed)\" are all piano drive uptempo numbers with fast paced Brazilian style marches played out on revered mid 80's style gated drum machines. The center of the album contains two rhythm guitar led pop oriented numbers in \"Camouflage\" and \"Torn Down\". \"Long Distance\",the title song,\"True\" and the closer \"Fall\" each connect with the piano driven gospel ballad back-round of Rodney Jerkins and Brandy gives them her all with her vocal punches.  A number of songs stand out on their own however. \"Piano Man\" finds the orchestral synthesizers playing a totally percussive roll while \"Shattered Love\" has a reverbed country\/surf bass line on it's mid-tempo groove. \"A Capella (Something's Missing)\" finds Brandy singing beautifully with an orchestra of her own vocal harmonies to the tune of a light fuzz guitar while \"1st & Love\" brings the clap powered hand jive into the 2000's era of soul music production.\n\n  Brandy declares at the start of this album that being human means the power to be herself. When I first listened to this album? I felt that she had totally abandoned the heavy funky and soul roots inherent in her sound previous to this for an ultra glossy and rather ordinary pop oriented sound. Listening to this album nearly eight years after it's original release? It became clear that only a couple of songs on this album really fit into that category. What this album ends up doing is entirely eschewing the hip-hop oriented production values of some of her 90's albums. This goes more for gospel\/soul based dance music and ballads that heavier funk. Yet it also references very early aspects of black American music that find Jerkins producing Brandy's voice and body as the main musical instrument. Each of Brandy's albums have had a distinctly different flavor about them. That's one of the qualities I appreciate about her artistry. This one actually may be one of those albums that takes a little getting used to. But peel back the layers of the music and your own preconceptions? You will probably find very compelling music here.","classification":5,"fold":4}

I only got Gavin's new CD because I really didn't know that it was a pop record.  I read his article in the July issue of Keyboard magazine and convinced myself he might be worth listening to.  He talked about artists like Jeff Beck and Van Morrison.  He talked about making inspiring records like his influences had.  Keyboard's staff writer declared that this kid was a supreme songwriter who was devoted to his craft.  Although  \"Chariot\" was a shot in the dark I'd say my expectations were right on the mark.  I immediately drew a comparison to the immortal Jeff Buckley.  Gavin can sing, and his voice truely saved this album from being another pop record.  But as for being a great songwriter I think I would have liked a little more instrumental integrity and variety; his straight forward rock riffs won't get him very far with music fans like me.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Silver-toned Ed Brown's 50 year news reporting career included stints at WMCA-570 AM and WNEW-1130 AM in NYC and for the RKO and NBC radio networks. He retired in 1997 after some years at WCHL-1360, in Chapel Hill, NC.\n\nFounded in 1925 as a 5,000 watt station at the top of the AM dial, by 1960 WMCA adopted their successful \"Good Guys\" Top 40 format. Despite competition from 50,000 watt clear channel WABC-770, 'MCA was NYC's ratings champ from 1963 through '66. By 1970, they transitioned to an all talk format called \"Dial-Log Radio.\"\n\nNYC's PREMIER ALBUMS was founded in 1959 as a budget operation with such labels as CORONET and SPIN-O-RAMA. In 1965, Premier bought out Philly-based CAMEO\/PARKWAY. Their JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY - A MEMORIAL ALBUM (#2099) is fine-quality: a substantial disc with good audio. The record reproduces in full a one-hour show narrated by Brown and broadcast over WMCA on the day of JFK's murder, 11\/22\/63.

Mansfield's comments were briefest, but also the most moving:\n\n\"There was a sound of laughter; in a moment, it\nwas no more. And so she took a ring from her finger\nand placed it in his hands.\nThere was a husband who asked much and gave much,\nand out of the giving and the asking wove with a\nwoman what could not be broken in life, and in a\nmoment it was no more.

{"text":"Dreams by The Cranberries is a powerful 90s rock song that is both stirring and healing to the soul.  Fighting the Urge to Look Up The Meaning to the Song, Dreams is about coming to terms with multiple changes happening in someones life while appreciating a person who occupies a large place in your heart (metaphorically).  I recently enjoyed hearing Dreams by The Cranberries on iheartradio because it is not played as often on the radio where I currently live  I completely understand that this song could mean something completely different from what Im guessing it is but for me the song reminds me of my husband in a benevolent way.  This is because he has helped me add even more brighter colors (metaphorically speaking) to my life and has helped me appreciate life even more just by his example of how he sees the positive benefits in certain things that would test even the strongest of souls.  Hence, when the lead singer of Cranberries sings you're a dream to me it reminds me of how I have told this to my husband before (just in slightly different words). Overall, Dreams by Cranberry is both an elevating and novelty type of rock song.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"\"Save The World\" is the companion DVD to the debut solo CD by Cadence Spalding. As with the CD, the themes of the DVD are the power of love, peace, and the need to care for Earth and the voiceless creatures that need our protection. Cadence's sincerity is palpable as is her deep emotional connection to the music and its message. Comparisons to Enya and 2002 are inevitable, but Cadence definitely has her own voice and vision.\n\nThe DVD contains all of the music from the CD paired with breathtaking double micro digital photographs by Mars Lasar of flowers, seascapes, the CA wine country, animals, children, and landscapes. The music is very effective alone, but the pairing with the photography provides a powerful sensory experience.\n\nThe first of the eleven tracks is \"Trust In Love,\" a simple melody that carries a message of love on a global as well as a personal level. The ethereal vocals have minimal accompaniment, but the sound is rich and lush. The title track is more instrumental (including Cadence's voice), with the words \"Save The World\" repeated throughout. \"Grandma's Song\" celebrates family love and a special bond between a young girl and her grandmother - a favorite! \"I Do,\" \"Here To Love You,\" and \"My Man\" are love songs, pure and simple, made heavenly by layers of voices, piano, and keyboards. I also really like \"Share Your Life,\" which also appears in a remixed version. The words tell us to open our lives and hearts to others to begin the global healing process and to make a difference in the world - beautiful in every way. \"Hosanna\" just sort of floats on the air, creating a mood of peaceful contentment. \"Kyrie Eleison\" (Greek for \"Lord have mercy\") is a mother's gentle, loving prayer for her young son. It seems to trail off at the end, but then returns after a period of silence, complete with bagpipes, to act as a grand finale of sorts.","classification":5,"fold":4}

Randy Yoder's cover photography is the perfect visual image of this music: beautiful & elegant.  Sweeten's musical style is similar throughout the disc; I might have hoped for a couple compositions with more pep and several with more variation in time structure, but this music has a wonderful place.

I never find his playing boring or unexciting. The audience in Chicago always adores him and I hope we will contiue to see him frequently. These two discs are available at an incredible low price. If you enjoy Ax in Chopin please check out his Brahms concertos and late Brahms solo piano Opus 117-119. He has recorded a lot of chamber music with Ma. I would start with the Chopin disc which has the cello sonata and also includes the early trio with Frank on the violin.

{"text":"When I first saw the image of a big-hair woman (think Marge Simpson) with thick lashes, I laughed. This woman looks like a total wreck and joke. What I didn't know was that I would eventually be addicted to Amy Winehouse's Back to Black. Like the last song on the album, she's like a drug herself.\n\nUnabashedly loud and trendy, Amy Winehouse has the sort of smothering voice that absolutely belittles her 23 years of age. Back to Black has the voice and soul sensibilities of a mature veteran. But here, we have a young woman bucking all the current trends in R&B without the need for senseless featued rap guest star and dishing out all the unsavoury aspects of her misaligned life thus far. And that's the richness and diversity of the album.\n\nAmy rocks and she knows it. She sings of love and pain from personal experience, all nothing we have not heard of but she does it so well in that old swinging 60's Motown style that every beat and note eventually gets stuck in that head of yours. Think of Rehab, you can't help but dance to that addictive beat. Think of You Know I'm Not Good and you might also feel that her unfaithfulness is justified. He Can Only Hold Her, Back to Black and the bonus Addictive further consolidates her position as the new star!\n\nIn her death, I realise how Back to Black will forever be christened as her best and most introspective record - the record that mirrors her life from addiction to heartbreak and a life of mockery. Gone too soon.","classification":5,"fold":4}

I haven't really yet heard it strongly from her from the songs so far from her sophmore album The MF Life. 4 A.M., the second single from the album isn't really as soul-driven as her voice has shown it over the past few years.

{"text":"Metallica's sophomore album, \"Ride The Lightning\" certainly showcases some interesting and classic thrashers. It's hard to imagine what the metal community nowadays would be like without gems like this album. It seems that this album seemed to be an overlooked one in Metallica's early catalogue, considering \"Kill 'Em All\" is generally considered the birth of thrash metal, \"Master of Puppets\" is regarded as Metallica's magnum opus, and \"...And Justice For All\" got Metallica some mainstream attention with the music video for \"One\".\nRegardless of whether or not \"Ride The Lightning\" is overlooked or not, it's still a classic that should be in every metalhead's collection. One interesting thing about this album is that while it still captured the raw power and fast energy of Metallica's debut, it seems to have a thicker, more polished, and at times, more epic sound. Don't get me wrong, though, I still think \"The Four Horsemen\" off their debut is one of the finest metal epics, but to get a full review of \"Ride The Lightning\", simply read on.\n\"Fight Fire With Fire\" starts things off with some classical acoustic guitar playing for a bit over half a minute. Suddenly, a crushing riff rips its way into your sound system at about a hundred miles an hour. The massive drums crash their ways in and you have a fast and furious headbanger about the evils of pollution and nuclear warfare. The singing is also very raw, with James singing a very staccato pattern, \"Do!...Un!...-to others!...As!...They've!...Done to you!\". Great way to start off the album.\n\"Ride The Lightning\", the six and a half minute epic title track starts off with some high-pitched guitar notes before going into a thrashy, Devil's Tritone riff. Some epic guitar soloing is featured in here, along with an interesting storyline that shows how the band is against capital punishment.\n\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\" is a progressive, five-minute classic with plenty of great guitar riffs that occupy the first two minutes of the song. The nastiest riff of them all is featured in the chorus, and some wild guitar playing closes this war song out.\n\"Fade To Black\" is a personal favorite of mine, one of the best songs on the album, and one of the very best songs Metallica's ever written. Some sad but beautiful acoustic guitar work opens with a lovely electric solo. Mournful but poetic lyrics occupy the verses, then comes a powerful chorus riff. More great guitar soloing fills the rest of the song out.\n\"Trapped Under Ice\" is another heavy song about struggle, featuring some dirty riffage and wild soloing that definitely makes itself worthy to be on the album.\n\"Escape\" is a more melodic, radio-friendly sounding song, but nonetheless a great track, as well. A bit shorter and a pretty cool song.\n\"Creeping Death\" is a song that defines thrash metal. This is an overall great song that you gotta hear. Its lyrics refer to the Seven Plagues in the story of Moses in the Bible, and the thrashing riffs pummel their way into your brain. And, as always, Kirk Hammett shows us why he's an amazing guitarist when he screeches out those awesome guitar solos.\n\"The Call of Ktulu\" is a nine-minute, progressive instrumental. A cool way to end the album, it has an odd but mesmerizing tone that features some mighty and powerful riffs and drums, alongside solos that give the song quite an epic tone. I personally prefer \"Orion\" off \"Master of Puppets\", but this song is definitely a great one, too.\nSo as you can see, \"Ride The Lightning\" is undoubtedly a classic metal album. I've seen it ranked as being one of the top ten metal albums of all time, and when you give this a listen, you'll see why. All of the tracks are very strong, the songwriting's great, as are the singing, guitar-, bass-, and drum-playing. Get this, along with the other three Metallica releases in the '80s, and even \"The Black Album\" if you're interested. Overall, this is a very strong and solid album that I would recommend to all fans of thrash metal, and heavy metal in general. Good job to the 'tallica guys! Thanks for the time, and peace.","classification":5,"fold":4}
{"text":"I can't believe the quality of this collection. Of course Amazon have let people down by not including the composer details in the metadata, but at the introductory price of $1.29 I'm not complaining - especially when kindly reviewers do the detective work for us. Bach Guild have presented us with a selection of their, often groundbreaking, recordings from the Vanguard label featuring luminaries of Baroque and Early Music such as George Malcolm and Nikolaus Harnoncourt. The collection includes, as far as I can tell, complete  albums from the Bach Guild \/ Vanguard catalogue, not all of which are available digitally and those that are are upwards of $9.99 per album. The label was an early advocate of Purcell, many of whose lesser-known works are included here, including the suite from \"Abdelazar\", the Rondeau of which formed the basis for Benjamin Britten's \"Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra\" and which  will be well known to many in that form.\nSo this must be the bargain of the year!

His voice is comparable to the ones belonging to Swedish melodeath kings Bjorn Strid and Christian Alvestam. It sounds that good.\n\nRight from the start you are treated to a lot of heavy riffing, and the attitude of the record helps you visualize the headbanging of the band during a live concert. Darker than it is heavy, Slipknot's fifth album is a great hybrid of everything they do well.\n\nMy favorite songs were Sarcastrophe, The devil In I, Skeptic, and Be Prepared For Hell.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library.  With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing.  It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.  Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon.  Thats right!  Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too.  In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.  Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great!  At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free\n\nFREE ALBUMS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Albums by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"The Fox is one of Elton's least known outputs in his entire catalouge.  It justed missed the top 20 (in the US) upon its release in May, 1981.  It also marked a transitional period in his career, coming off the sometimes successful but ultimately unfocused albums like 21 at 33 to the more straight ahead pop smarts of Too Low for Zero.  Although The Fox leans much more toward the unfocusedness of 21 at 33, due to the mishmash of writing partners and use of outside musicians in places, it is a much more interesting and satisfying experience than anything he had turned out in years.\n\nI find The Fox to be an album that tries to stretch out a bit, prehaps begging to cover a little too much territory.  As a few reviewers have noted previously, this was his first with Geffen Records and first with producer Chris Thomas (who would also produce his next 3 albums). Therefore undoubtedly the game plan was for this one to make a grand statement.  This ambition shows up in songs like \"Fascist Faces\", the beautiful instrumental trio \"Carla\/Etude\/Fanfare\" and the more traditional love ballad \"Chloe.\"  The usage of the Rev James Cleveland choir, a full string orchestra, and new agey synthesizers drive home the point that this isn't meant to be a cohesive statement, but meant to try to satisfy trends and make \"the cutting edge\" for 1981.  Most of the time, it acheives this due to Elton's tunefulness and ultra-competent instrumentation.\n\nHighlights of the album are many and scattered throughout.  It would be easier to mention the few dead ends that are hit.  While \"Just Like Belgium\" is fun and lively, it really doesn't stand out amongst the other more adventursome tracks, and \"Heels of the Wind\" seems unneccessary, almost like an afterthought.  Big departures from his previous work are the tracks \"Heart in the Right Place\" with its forceful, blues-rock tone and \"Fascist Faces\" with the backing of the Rev James Cleveland Choir.  Both tracks are propelled by the biting, metalish guitar play of Richie Zito, which make these two of the heaviest tracks in Elton's canon.\n\nIn the end, The Fox is far from a masterpiece along the lines of Honky Chateau or Yellow Brick Road, but it is one of the most interesting in Elton's now 35 + year solo career.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to experience the more arty side of what would become \"I'm Still Standing\" and \"Sad Songs\" just a few years down the road.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Has a distinctly 80's and 90's sound to it, and that's not a bad thing.\n\nMuch of the album has a 1980's musical style in it's electronic sound and beats. But the vocals are distinctly modern. It's a great duality. Some tracks, like \"Parade\" and \"Make a Shadow\" have a more 90's sound with the breathy vocals and the minimalist instrumentation. Nothing sounds super modern and new, and that's not an insult. There's a reason people like the classic sounds of older music. It's because it's awesome. Myers has captured that sound.\n\nThe lyrics are pure passion. You can tell Myers is signing them from her soul. You can't deliver lyrics like this and have them sound genuine if they aren't. \"Desire\" is a prime example. It's a gritty and raw song about wanting to be with someone physically (Really, Amazon auto filter? I can't use the S word?) It manages to capture that strong desire for connection with a partner that occurs right before clothes come off in a song. And it does it without being cheesy. That's not an easy thing to do. (Which brings us back to the 80's, where there were 1000 songs that did this in a cheesy way. I'm looking at you, George Michael) It's a BRILLIANT song that captures the raw emotions of humanity's most primal urge.\n\nMeg Myers has the potential to be a HUGE star.

{"text":"I was so excited about this disc, put it in the changer, and was disappointed.  Each time I put it in the changer, I liked more things about it.  Until the 4th spin, wow!  I connected.  Blast off with me and \"Stranger to Stranger.\"  I went through a period in my life when I was upsetting people because they didn't get my sense of humor.  Paul Simon's humor is like mine, very dry.  His lyrics abound in ironic twists like the opening of \"The Werewolf,\" \"Milwaukee man led a fairly decent life, made a fairly decent living, had a fairly decent wife; She killed him -- sushi knife; Now they're shopping for a fairly decent afterlife.\"  Great irony there with a wry comment about the commercialization of religion.  The first single \"Wristband\" seems to parallel a scene from Michael Keaton's film \"Birdland\" where the star gets hassled about getting into his own event, remarkable for its throbbing rhythmic track, much like the \"Birdland\" soundtrack.  \"Proof of Love\" appeals to me with its melodic dirge and great acoustic guitar, \"The road is steep; The air is thin; I hear a voice inside my skin, \"Don't be afraid; Your days won't end with night; Feel the sun, drink the rain, let your body heal its pain, bathe beneath a waterfall of light.\"  Lovely poetic images.  \"The Riverbank\" is the track that's been in my personal top ten this summer, entrancing me with its marriage of melody and lyric, \"Army dude, only son, nowhere to run, no one to turn to, he turns to the gun; It's a cross, it's a stone, It's a fragment of bone; It's a long walk home.\"  \"Cool Papa Bell\" is a song about a Negro League baseball player which Simon laces with well-placed profanity.  On the deluxe edition, Simon closes the set with a duet with classic rock singer Dion on \"New York Is My Home.\"  Gorgeous!  Paul Simon's \"Stranger to Stranger\" sits well within his body of work, fresh, laced with wry wit and inventive arrangements.  Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"It consisted of one verse and one chorus. The other 14 minutes were a jam featuring an organ solo by Doug Ingle, a guitar solo by Erik Brann and a drum solo by Ron Bushy. Bassist Lee Dorman got half a duet with Ingle, but Bushy proved with his drum solo that you can get away with repeating \"Shave and a Haircut, Six Bits\" for a long time. As long as you dress it up with enough effects pedals. He got half a duet with Ingle too--a fantasia built on (would you believe) \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\". So when Atco edited out everything but the vocal section, you got three reps each of the verse and refrain. So it didn't make much of a single.

Railroad Earth (6 piece new-grass jamband) provides great support giving all these songs (8 out of 13 which are Haynes originals) an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel (like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blisters and last for many miles of trail). I enjoyed the whole of Disc1 even though Haynes' song writing itself is only so-so, and the more stripped down demo versions on the shorter disc 2 aren't bad, although none of them seem essential. In fact, I thought the final live track weak, and the earlier demos are pretty depressing sounding without the cover of more instrumentation. So perhaps a single disc edition would be fine for most fans.\n\nOverall a great recording with plenty of tasty guitar playing (especially slide) from Haynes, an apparently tireless artist with a vast and varied palette.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Heres something weve all been waiting for! All X billion of us! And now that we have it, it gives us all the opportunity to talk about our disappointment in it, for isn't that what we all do now? But Im not going to do that. (At least not right now.) I am just going to talk about how much there is to enjoy about this set, and why I purchased it, despite owning 95% of it already in original, as well as archive editions. And the reason is that its Paul McCartney. Pure and simple. What follows is a bit of a lengthy essay to put this release from this artist who straddles the centuries  into context. Please click on \"read more\" to read the complete review! But the bottom line is: If you're a fan, strongly consider it. If you're a casual listener, don't hesitate. Eight bucks a disc for 16 songs on each disc in the best sound currently available? I call that a deal. Even without the dirty flowers\" that are scheduled for release later this year.\n\nSeveral years ago, there was a well-meaning but ultimately pointless release entitled The Art Of McCartney. That two-disc set was a collection of McCartney songs performed as xerox copies of the obvious choices by an eclectic group of artists. The results ranged from good to embarrassing. It left most listeners with one question in their heads. Why?.\n\nThis collection seems to be McCartneys response, and a way to make amends. How does one create a collection - even a 4 disc set - that satisfies the needs of a legion of fans all over the globe who have nurtured, followed, left, returned, gotten older with, and introduced new generations to the music of the cleverest, most prolific - and at times most frustrating banal - composer of culture shifting popular songs? A pop composer whose skill and popularity is rivaled only by Irving Berlin in the 20th century? The answer is, you cant.\n\nDespite the stated intentions of the corporate-McCartney-spin-machine in putting together a collection of my recordings with nothing else in mind other than having something fun to listen to. Maybe to be enjoyed on a long car journey or an evening at home, or at a party with friends this remains a pretty random overview of McCartneys post-Beatles work. Its guaranteed to meet the needs of folks who haven't bought a disc since Band On The Run, just as its guaranteed to frustrate those who have followed Macca through New. Thats Paul McCartney. Havent you learned that by now? So jump in your hot rod or relax in your hot bath and give these ditties a spin..???  (insert groan\/grimace).\n\nSo what is Pure McCartney? Its simply a superb collection of pop tunes that sound really great - and in the case of some of them, have never sounded better. Get the discs, add some tunes, delete some tunes, re-order the tunes - whatever. This collection is guaranteed to put a song in your heart, taps on your toes, and a smile on your face (even if its not your brave one.) Even you are not one of the legions of rabid Paul fans who have each release, you will be delighted anew by Jet, Uncle Albert\/Admiral Halsey, Say, Say, Say, and My Love. And you will undoubtably enjoy making your acquaintanceship with Jenny Wren, New, Dance Tonight, and Sing The Changes (wonderful, brave choice that) and others. Special appreciation for the inclusion of Only Mama Knows and Queenie Pie, two truly great songs - if you're unfamiliar with them, you're in for a treat.\n\nThat said, lets get the obvious omissions out of the way. First, as I noted in discussion thread on this page, there are no songs from Flowers In The Dirt, one of the strongest albums of McCartneys solo career. The reason is simple: Pure McCartney is a set-up for its release in the Archive series. This way, it is assured that we will all dutifully purchase it to add to our playlists. Paul McCartney is not merely the greatest composer of the past 100 years, he is also a masterful self-promoter, with Donald Trump and J.K. Rowling running a close second and third.  I say that with absolutely no disrespect to Macca given the successful span of his career. But you really will need to get Flowers In The Dirt  when its released later this year.\n\nIn terms of omissions, be thankful that we're not subjected to C Moon (It will be L-7\/and Ill never get to heaven\/if I fill my head with gloom). Or, Mary Had A Little Lamb. Or Temporary Secreta....or yea. Thats here. Oh well. And in fairness, TS has picked up its fair share of fans recently. Second - and less understandable - are some other omissions. Where is So Bad, arguably one of the greatest pop songs of the 1980s. Or Run Devil Run, where McCartney Little RIchards\" his vocal cords in a style not heard since 1965 - proving that he still can. Or at least still could at that point in time. Or the Academy-award nominated (and light weight) Vanilla Sky? Or the perfectly charming Little Lamb Dragonfly from Red Rose Speedway? Better yet - where is the blistering Souvenir from Flaming Pie? Ill stop there. You can add you're own 2 cents. Im sure you all will ;)''Third - Given what was omitted omissions, how on earth did McCartney and his crack team include the atrocious Bip Bop? Or the overly sentimental and treacly Warm And Beautiful ? (Sunlight's morning glory\/tells the story\/of our love  Moonlight on the water\/brings me inspiration\/ever after ) Maybe thats the one to listen to in your hot tub.\n\nAnd alright, all right -  I concede that Temporary Secretary seems to have developed an almost cult-like following that has lead to its inclusion on the current tour - but Winedark Open Sea? Or the creaky, rhetorical Early Days (contradicted by the 3 remaining Beatles themselves in the Anthology DVD set)? Or the dreadfully dated disco ditty Goodnight Tonight? (GT divides fans, much in the same way as Silly Love Songs does, though I love the catchiness of the latter. And SLS is a perfect distillation of McCartneys songwriting philosophy and craft).\n\nI would only add one other point (as Im sure others will pipe in with their piece). Maybe Im Amazed, one of the greatest songs in the McCartney canon was a really, really poor selection as the opening track. (Why start the film with the money shot?) My choice would have been Dance Tonight. With it thump-thump-thump opening, its joyous mandolin, and its message (Everybody gonna stamp their feet\/Everybody's gonna feel the beat\/Everybody gonna dance around tonight) it would have invited everyone in to have a great time.\n\nAnd minor gripes aside, thats really what youll have if you get this collection. I pity the naysayers who will be unable to experience the joy of McCartneys music due to either what was included, or what was omitted from this set. Ive defended Paul McCartney quite a bit in the 70s and 80s. That isn't necessary now that hes gotten older, wiser, and more - um, shall we say - clear headed. He was awarded The Gershwin Prize! A Grammy Lifetime Achievement award winner! Hes a MusiCares award winner!  He has had a 46 year career AFTER The Beatles. He survived the loss of the deeply profound love of his life and the subsequent marriage to the bane of his existence. His internal flame of optimism lead him to the spiritual renewal of his marriage to his valentine, Nancy. And throughout all of these ups and downs, he has kept a smile on his face and has provided us with songs that have provided the joyous soundtrack to our own lives. ''And by doing this, Id argue that McCartney has brought more joy and happiness to more people on this planet than any other person. (My God - hes played for both Gorbachev and Putin counting them among his fans (''I had some Russians come up to me and say: 'You say yes; I say no. Hello, goodbye. I am real nowhere man.' '')\n\nWhats the point in complaining about whats wrong in this collection? There is nothing wrong with it. Its just that McCartneys music is so omnipresent -  so inscribed in our consciousness, so deeply personalized - that we all have our opinions about it. Nonetheless, McCartneys preternatural gift for melody and song has, in some way, been a gift to each and every one of us. And our lives are better for his presence.\n\nSo, thanks.  To a person Ive never really met (there was that one time seeing him and Nancy  on line for popcorn in a movie theater in  NYC) yet have been on a first-name basis with for 52 years. Godspeed Sir Paul. And again - thank you.\n\nListen to this collection with appreciation and gratefulness. If you can do that, Pure McCartney is pure gold.'''''","classification":5,"fold":4}

I listened to it only a couple of times, then put it away. I won't be playing it again anytime soon.

{"text":"`Frontiers records' has come up with some rather original ideas for melodic albums but this one is really genius. `Kiske - Sommerville', as the title suggests and most are already aware, is a melodic hard rock\/metal album based on vocals duets of legendary German vocalist Michael Kiske and female vocal authority Amanda Somerville.\n\nI suppose there is not much reason to go into details regarding the abilities and approaches of the two singers as they are both metal idols at their own right while their contribution on this album has been very much explored by other reviewers. With that in mind I would like to stand on the other factors (beyond Michael and Amanda) that make this album such a musical success and for that matter are just as important as the names on the front cover.\n\nA key success factor was bringing to the project possibly the most capable songwriting core of `Frontiers records' that of bassist Mat Sinner and guitarist Magnus Karlsson. Both have been known for delivering amazing melodic works in the genres of melodic AOR, hard rock and metal; and the collaboration of the seasoned Mat with the younger Magnus ideally balances old school and modern influences on the album. The album features additional songwriting by Keyboard player Jimmy Kresic and Amanda, the material they come up with is more mid tempo and symphonic\/orchestra-oriented. So closing the songwriting part, the listener does enjoy a variety of rock and metal styles throughout `Kiske\/Somerville' while all songs are consistent in big melodies and stellar production.\n\nIn terms of performing line-up the project finds Matt Sinner on bass guitar, Magnus Karlsson on lead guitar, Sander Gommans also on lead guitar, Jimmy Kresic on keyboards while drum duties are divided between Ramy Ali and Martin Schmidt.\nInstrument-wise this project continues to surprise as Sinner's bass is louder and more aggressive than one would expect, Magnus' solos are instantly recognizable and never compromised in their length, while the drumming is far more intense than anyone would have anticipated, referring not only to the double bass attack but to the very technical stick work that is to be found throughout the album.\n\nYes, \"Kiske-Somerville\" does capture the best of Michael Kiske and Amanda Somerville still it goes on to offer the listener much more that simply an all star project. It is impossible to find any fault on this album:\n1)The concept is original 2) The songwriting is diverse yet consistently melodic 3) the singers live up to their reputation while uncovering much more of their vocal abilities than expected 4) the performance on instruments unforgettable and 5) it is all topped by possibly the greatest production ever.\n\nThe limited edition features a 12th bonus track `Set Afire' and a DVD with the two breathtaking promo videos for `If I had a wish' and `Silence'.","classification":5,"fold":4}

But she also went into a more dance rhythm with her music. While it has worked well for her past songs, Love Takes Over and Motivation, this one doesn't add as much drive as was before. Kisses Down Low, Kelly's latest solo song isn't really as ear-catching as was before. I didn't feel her voice lived up to the hype from her songs before.

{"text":"If You Leave Me Now is a nostalgic trip to my childhood. It was released in 1976, when I was nine years old. I have vivid memories of hearing it during that summer, driving around in the VW Beetle with my Mom, hanging out at the public pool as it played over the loudspeakers. In a way, it is a kind of security blanket. In my mind's catalogue of songs, it shares a drawer with 'If you could read my mind.' Maybe I like soft songs with 'if' in the title? Nah...'If'' by Bread would never be allowed past security. Kick that one to the curb. That's the song that starts out with that 'wawawawawa...wawawawawa...'sound. 'If a man could throw up on a song, then why can't I throw up on it too...' hahaha.\n\nBut......I digress. IYLMN was a global smash for Chicago, hitting #1 in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, The Netherlands. I think it inspired every song in Air Supply's catalogue. It starts out all soft and gentle, light horns and strings, a finger cymbal. Peter Cetera busts out his high-pitched Beach Boy vocals. Nice harmonies, a soft Terry Kath acoustic guitar solo, joined by strings. The only part I don't like is around 2:00, those rising strings are totally over the top and unnecessary. And I can always do without James Pankow and his trombone, ughhh. I especially love the layered string buildup on the outro. And how about Cetera's 'Oooh, girl, just got to have you by my side' scat. OK, this is not the kind of music I typically listen to, but it's like being a Cubs fan...I can't not like this song, no matter how I try. Now, 'Hard to say I'm sorry?'

The songs are well written with meaningful lyrics and the music, as always, is beautiful and intuitive. It's hard to believe there are only 3 musicians, including Harris, making all the music. Long, weeping fiddle notes and chunky, contemplative piano chords are balanced only by the occasional tentative brightness of a banjo or mandolin. The percussion is distant, if there at all, but always clever. \"Darlin' Kate\" is about her close friend Kate McGarrigle who died last year of cancer. \"The Road\" looks back to her formative years spent with the late Gram Parsons at the start of her career. \"Big Black Dog\" is inspired by her animal shelter philanthropy and is the only almost-happy song on the album. \"My name is Emmett Till is the true story of a 14 year old black boy killed in Mississippi for talking to a white woman. Overall the strength and sincerity of Harris' songs make this just another reason to love and respect her.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Every day an unknown number of new listeners is thrilled by first hearing the glittering Scheherazade, but to conductors it's as hackneyed as the 1812 Overture, unless...\n\nThe \"unless\" covers a lot of ways to invigorate this warhose. Stokowski applies lush gaudiness in his three readings, which can be thrilling. Reiner gave us astonishing orchestral virtuosity from the Chicago Sym. and one of Living Stereo's best recordings, a marvel almost fifty years on. beecham delivers a fresh, buoyant readding that comes close to being joyous (though the EMI recording is dated).\n\nTemirkanov certainly has the potential to do something special with Scheherazade, but what we get instead is an all-around straighforward reading, good but not spectacular sound, and some nice expressive touches here and there. The NY Phil. doesn't sound that jazzed, either. Altogether, I had hoped for more.","classification":3,"fold":4}

I've seen reviews where people give a collection one star just because THAT song wasn't on there. But this 17-song collection is a pretty accurate representation of Keith Sweat's career.\nI noticed that a lot of the songs are from his first album Make It Last Forever. Sure, that was his best album, but maybe he should've included a good number of songs from ALL of the albums. Oh well, there are other hits you remember, like \"Nobody\", \"Twisted\", \"I'll Give All My Love To You\", and even LSG's \"My Body\". And most hits collections contain a hard-to-find song, and here there's \"(There You Go) Tellin' Me No Again\" (from the New Jack City soundtrack).\nI'm not exactly sure why the Snoop Dogg-assisted \"Come And Get With Me\" is on here, but regardless, this is still a good album to buy if all your Keith Sweat cassettes are worn out or lost.\nAnthony Rupert","classification":4,"fold":4}

And more freakouts and distortion and weirdness for the sake of weirdness. Yeah, that would make this album awesome.\"\n\nThen, lo and behold, the Flaming Lips and their \"fwends\" release this album. Wow, it's like fate!\n\nBack to reality...\n\nI've been a fan of the Flaming Lips since the 90s. They have released some excellent albums that will stand the test of time. Unfortunately, they've become a band of gimmicks as of late (gummy skulls, ridiculously long songs, blood, etc.). This is the worst gimmick of all. This is a complete embarrassment to music. The cover of \"Lucy\" was enough on its own. Was it really necessary to cover an entire classic album? That's a question that really doesn't need to be answered out loud.\n\nIs it worth listening to this? Maybe once, just to experience the horror. However, I will leave you with this warning: you will never be able to forget you listened to this travesty. I only hope that one day I can again listen to Sgt Pepper without being reminded that this atrocity exists.","classification":1,"fold":4}

{"text":"I always look forward to a new Chris Tomlin release.  Anyone who follows contemporary worship music will admit that Tomlin is a tremendous talent.  But his talent is not the main attraction.  Sure his music is good but what makes him a special artist is the depth of songs he writes and sings.  Some themes come to mind that seem to keep making their way into Tomlin's music: the majesty of God, the gospel, the cross of Christ, the sinfulness of man, and the grace of God.\n\n\"Whom shall I Fear\" is driving song that points saints to our trustworthy God:\n\nMy strength is in Your name, for You alone can save\/You will deliver me, Yours is the victory\/Whom shall I fear?\/Whom shall I fear?\/I know who goes before me\/I know who stands behind, the God of angel armies is by my side\/The One who reigns forever, He is a friend of mine\/The God of angel armies is always by my side.\n\nAnd nothing formed against me shall stand\/You hold the whole world in your hands\/I'm holding on to Your promises\/You are faithful, You are faithful.\n\n\"White Flag\" is an anthem that invites rebels to surrender to the King of the universe.  With a U2 feel, the song is a bold affirmation of the penal substitutionary atonement and the sufficiency of Christ's cross:\n\nThe battle rages on as storm and tempest roar\/We cannot win this fight, inside our rebel hearts\/We're laying down our weapons now\/We raise our white flag, we surrender all to You, all for You\/We raise our white flag, the war is over, love has come, Your love has won.\n\nHere on this holy ground, You made a way for peace\/Laying your body down, You took our rightful place\/This freedom song is marching on!\/We raise our white flag, we surrender all to You, all for You\/We raise our white flag, the war is over, love has come, Your love has won.\n\nTomlin has a gift for reintroducing the great hymns of the church with a contemporary feel and even adding some new lyrics that complement a given hymn.  For instance, \"Crown Him With Many Crowns\" is a hymn that Tomlin reframes the on the disc:\n\nCrown Him with many crowns the Lamb upon His throne\/Hark how the heavnenly anthems drones  all music but its own\/Awake my soul and sing, of Him who died for me\/And hail Him as thy matchless King through all eternity\n\nMajesty, Lord of all, let every throne before Him fall\/The King of kings, oh come adore!  Our God who reigns for evermore!\n\nCrown Him the Lord of life who triumphed over the grave \/And rose victorious in the strife for those He came to save\/His glories now we sing, who died and rose on high\/Who died eternal life to bring and lives that death may die.\n\nMajesty, Lord of all, let every throne before Him fall\/The King of kings, oh come adore!  Our God who reigns for evermore!\n\nMy favorite song, \"Sovereign\" reminds listeners that God reigns on high.  He is the King who is owing of our allegiance and trust:\n\nSovereign in the mountain air, sovereign on the ocean floor, with me in the calm, with me in the storm\/Sovereign in my greatest joy, sovereign in my deepest cry, with me in the dark, with me at the dawn.\n\nIn your everlasting arms, all the pieces of my life from beginning to the end, I can trust You\/In Your never-failing love, You work everything for good, God whatever comes me way, I will trust You.\n\nAll my hopes, all I need - held in Your hands, All my life, all of  me - held in Your hands, All my fears, all my dreams - held in Your hands ...\n\nMy family and our good friends from Christ Fellowship had the pleasure of worshipping with Chris Tomlin last summer at the County Fair in Lynden, Washington.  As we worshipped, I noticed the carnival in the background.  Hoards of people enjoyed the rides and screamed as the zipper soared and the roller coaster roared.  The thought struck me, \"Everyone is a worshipper.\"  And while God's people drank deeply from an inexaustable fountain, the people of the world found their delight in lesser things.  The scene reminded me of the well-known episode in John Bunyan's epic work, Pilgrim's Progress where the people reveled in Vanity Fair.  It was a surreal moment that I will not soon forget.\n\nChris Tomlin reminds Baptists and Presbyterians that hand clapping is not only permissible - it is commanded!  He reminds Charismatics that a good beat is a good thing - but never good enough.  It must be accompanied by sound doctrine.  Burning Lights is a none other than a radical call to God-centeredness; a call to worship.  Thanks go out to Chris Tomlin for leading the people of God to the throne of God for the glory of God!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I'm not going to lie to you: I didn't like Taylor Swift's 1989. I thought it was boring. I thought it was plain. I thought it was bland. So I might not be the right person to listen to about this record.\nI like Ryan Adams okay. He's written some really great songs. He's put out some really strong albums. I don't like everything he does (included but limited to his recent production work on Butch Walker's AFRAID OF GHOSTS) but I would say I enjoy more of his stuff than not.\nSo when I heard that he was doing a track-by-track cover of Taylor Swift's immensely overrated 1989 I was a little intrigued. Especially when he was said to be doing so in the style of the Smiths. So when it hit Spotify I thought I would give it a chance to see if it was worth the purchase.\nI am glad I did so. Because these songs are still just not very good. Adams does a couple of interesting things here. But I still find the narrator of these songs incredibly out of date and incredibly out of step with the real world. The melodies never really take hold and it's kind of boring to listen to. Maybe as background music this works but it didn't command my attention.\nBut a lot of people seem to like this version also. So I am just missing something. Because even in this context I find these songs on the weaker side of mediocre.","classification":2,"fold":4}

{"text":"You should have just titled this one, \"contractual obligation,\" Gaga. Seriously, what's the difference?  You had X amount of minutes to fill with the label demanding a between-album shelf-filler, and you needed something tossed together quickly -- hey, I understand -- but, JAYSUS... at least TRY and disguise things a bit better next time, okay? Don't be so blatant.\n\nAlejandro sounds like a throw-away from an old Ace Of Base album -- and by that I mean something (!!!) actually not good enough to have made it onto an Ace Of Base album (!!!). What was the seed here, Gaga... was it I SAW THE SIGN...?!! Good God. ABBA could have done this -- in fact, I think they actually DID do this. (!) I note the clever use of the word \"Fernando\" within the song -- that's almost an inside joke, right there (for those of you who don't get it, Fernando was the title of an old ABBA single (and if ABBA's version was in B-minor, then Gaga didn't even bother with a transposition)). It might not be a direct ABBA rip, but hey... it's a wink, and I definitely get the joke. Let's hope ABBA's lawyer's are tone-deaf, at least until the 1970's-era copyright runs out.\n\nLook, Gaga: stop this garbage. Tell the record company next time that you're simply not ready to drop the album. They'll understand. You're lucky you got a Top 10 single out of what would have been, for most acts -- as they call these things in tennis -- an UNFORCED ERROR. You won't get this lucky twice force-feeding the product, and YOU KNOW IT. Fill the product pipeline with a live unit, or maybe a re-mix collection (it's probably too early to do a greatest hits) but for crying out loud, STOP THE RECYCLING OF RANDOM OLD SLUDGE FROM YESTERDAY-RADIO.\n\n3 stars, just because I'm feeling generous.\n\nABBA did it better -- and Ace of Base probably would have done it better, as well.\n\n'nuff said.","classification":3,"fold":4}

Most people would just say, \"Don't listen to it\" and I wish I could, but being stuck in retail all day, the managers have the radio going all day, stuck on 101.9 Fox FM or Nova 100. These two radio stations are your typical morons who spin the same 5 songs on repeat ALL DAY. It drives me nuts.\n\nThe first time I heard this song it gave me a headache at how bad I thought it was, it sounded like a stupid child whining the chorus out. Everyday I have worked since then, this damn song come on every hour, and it has brought me to my knees begging the managers to please change the damn radio station so none of us have to hear this god awful p.o.s again. Today when begging the manager, he was extremely busy on the phones and said it's the least of his worries right now, so I had to hear this garbage 6 times in an 8 hour shift. Thank god I missed the first hours one and the one they probably played during my lunch break, but I was cursed into hearing it again 3 times after that, it became so bad I wished we sold guns so I could shoot myself. However, we do sell fishing harpoon guns, and I was tempted 3 times to grab the damn thing and harpoon it through my head having to be forced to listen to this overrated, overplayed, sung by a no good, no talent artist who fans say \"she writes from the heart\"... OH, FOR F SAKES, SHUT UP ALREADY!!! so does every other friggen artist on the planet.\n\n What makes her so special? That she wrote it into an annoying tune and called it music? BAN THIS SONG FROM EVERY BEING PLAYED ON RADIO EVER AGAIN, SOMEONE, PLEASE! Everyone who comes into the store agree that they can't stand this song, it's like child's music where anyone who doesn't understand what real music is, and most likely thinks adding a beat to a cross walk signal is the greatest songs ever written.

{"text":"Since his debut as a solo artist in 2005, Bobby Valentino's music has been consistent. Cut from the same cloth as the likes of Donell Jones, he has made a handful of great albums but his name is rarely mentioned. When he released his sophomore effort \"Special Occasion\", the album wasn't given the proper promotion. A lot of that had to do with a solid album having its weakest songs released as singles. Further complicating matters was Def Jam's newest signees at the time, future stars Ne-Yo and Rihanna. 2009 saw him move to Capitol Records for the long winded but surprisingly good third album \"The Rebirth\". He followed it up with his second and final recording for the label, the uneven \"Fly On The Wall\". As Capitol had been known to underpromote its R&B artists, Bobby Valentino decided to take matters into his own hands and go independent- which brings us to his first album for eOne Music \"Dusk Till Dawn\".\n\nOn his fifth album, he keeps things short and simple- a thirteen track album that's a little under fifty minutes. Joining him on this album are some familiar names- such Red Cafe \"Role Play\", Gucci Mane on \"Rock Body\", and Philadelphia rapper Cassidy on \"She Got It All\". He collaborates with Lil' Wayne for the third time on the first single \"Mirror\" and trades verses with Memphis singer and \"Love & Hip Hop\" star K. Michelle on \"Put It In\". He links up with his longtime producers Tim Kelley & Bob Robinson for their lone contribution to the album \"Are You Ready\". Newcomer Jeffery \"J Leron\" Toney produces roughly half of the album and does most of the strongest songs on here. Bobby sings about wanting alcohol to enhance a sexual encounter on \"Tipsey Love\", which features a guest appearance from Southern rapper Future. Bobby pines for a long distance love on \"1st Class Love\". He pleads with a woman to let her guard down on \"Before You Break My Heart\" and closes the album with the somber ballad \"Save Me From Me\". Bobby Valentino's \"Dusk Till Dawn\" is a great album from beginning to end. While almost all of the producers are virtual unknowns, they're close to capturing the sound of his earlier work. In other words, this is an album worth having.","classification":5,"fold":4}

But....here's the thing....I love to sing along to my music as I'm driving around town, and the lyrics - clever though they are - are a bit risque.  I mean, I'm not a prude, but its gotta be nasty to see an old grandma-type woman driving around singing about sex at the top of her lungs.  Right?  Oh, well.  Not my problem.

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Just a perfect record.  There is so much swing in this LP, and it comes out of a handful of instruments.\nThe vibes rule the record, but it is Peterson's piano that holds down the fort from beginning to end.  Tasty bass, economic drums, and a sharp choice of tunes.\nThe soft intro will fool you.  Two minutes in you will find yourself ready to move with it, and it doesn't let go.\nI have gone through 3 copies of this record--2 vinyl and 1 CD--over the past 20 years, and I never get tired of it.\nThis ranks with the best of Mingus or Miles Davis, in my book.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Adam Lambert's 3rd studio album, \"The Original High\" is a good album but I prefer \"For Your Entertainment\" and \"Trespassing\". I think the main problem I have with \"The Original High\" is the music. The music sounds generic and uninspired like it came out of a computer. The \"instruments\" are so manufactured, it's ridiculous. And I wish Adam's beautiful voice wasn't so synthesized. I don't know why the producers have chosen to \"water down\" Adam's god-given vocals. He CAN SING ANYTHING, he doesn't need studio help. Geez. Adam co-wrote 9 out of the 14 tracks. He's a good songwriter but I must admit, this album feels sort of safe and predictable. And it's a little bit uneven. Some songs are dark and intense, and some are very poppy. Adam has stated in interviews that \"The Original High\" has more of electronic sound and less of a pop sound. But for me, this album feels very much pop. Don't get me wrong - I like pop music but I was really hoping that Adam would step outside his comfort zone and make a more \"grown-up\" album. I feel like he played it safe. Sorry, but that's just my opinion. Anyway, here's my two cents about each song below:\n\nTHE GEMS:\n\n\"Ghost Town\" - Fresh and innovative. The most experimental track. Starts off acoustic and dives into a thumping dance track. Stunning.\n\"The Original High\" - Very melodic and has a strong hook. Has a great summertime vibe. Breezy and has good tempo changes. Awesome.\n\"There I Said It\" - A gorgeous and heartbreaking ballad. Adam pours his heart and soul into this song. Gives me goose bumps. Emotional.\n\"Evil in the Night\" - This song is just amazing. I hope it is released as his next single. Radio-friendly but not fluffy or corny. Great vocals.\n\"Lucy\" - The only true rock song. Superb guitar solo by Brian May of Queen. It's edgy, brooding, and unlike the rest of the album. Good stuff.\n\"The Light\" - Ugh. I love this song. Reminds me of early '90s house music. It's catchy and melodic. Musically, it's the strongest track.\n\"Heavy Fire\" - THE BEST TRACK. Also contains Adam's best vocal. I wish the rest of the album had the vibe\/intensity of this amazing track. A+\n\"Shame\" - I'll admit it, I hated this song at first. It's so slick but I grew to love it. It's fun, silly, and flamboyant. A guilty pleasure all the way.\n\nMIDDLE OF THE PACK:\n\n\"Another Lonely Night\" - I don't really care for the music and the profanity kind of throws me off. It's a pretty mid-tempo track but predictable.\n\"Underground\" - I have mixed feelings about this song. I like dark pop songs but like I stated before, Adam's vocals are manipulated. Frustrating.\n\"After Hours\" - This song feels more like an interlude. Way too short and never gets \"off the ground\". It's different but decent. Very laid-back.\n\nTHE MEDIOCRE:\n\n\"Rumors\" - Good chorus but the verses are awkward. Another track where Adam's voice sounds unrecognizable. In a nutshell, this track is boring.\n\"Things I Didn't Say\" - Another song with a good chorus but awkward verses. I'm just not feeling it. Feels more like a Kelly Clarkson reject. Next.\n\"These Boys\" - This song just irritates me. It's artificial and embarrassing. Juvenile. You can do better than this, Adam! Enough said.\n\nAs you can see, I do enjoy the majority of these songs but it took me a while to fully embrace it. I just wish this album had more ballads that showcased Adam's beautiful vocals. But I must admit, I'm not 100% happy with \"The Original High\" and I have a terrible feeling that Adam isn't either. I feel like Adam's charisma isn't present on some of these songs. Like he was basically going though the motions in the recording studio. I don't know. I just hope his next album will be a game-changer. When I first heard \"Ghost Town\" - I remember thinking, now this song is groundbreaking and current. But then when I heard the rest of the album, I couldn't help but be disappointed. Adam is so crazy talented but sometimes his songs don't match up with what he can truly do. I still love him and I wish him success. I just think Adam was selling himself WAY too short with \"The Original High\" and that's a crying \"shame\".","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"When it has came down to Coldplay, they have honestly been one of the most distinctive and melodic acts to have ever came out of the 2000 decade. Hard to believe that it has been over 15 years since Coldplay made their debut with Parachutes, and the songs that they have released have mostly been strong, uplifting and incredible. Chris Martin & company have not one group that has been tiring, they have just gotten better with age. But the past few years have been hard for the group. For Chris Martin, his marriage to Gwenyth Paltrow ended in divorce, but their music has not been as solid as what it was before. So lately, I have been going back to what made the guys from the U.K. so classy and distinctive from before. One of their bigger songs from 2005's X & Y, Fix You actually is one of those songs that really is melodic and brilliant. I early on liked the song, while I didn't find it as strong as The Scientist, Speed Of Sound or Clocks. But still, it is definitely a great song to listen to, and one of those gems that you should hear, if you have just gotten into Coldplay for the first time.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Great.","classification":5,"fold":4}
{"text":"It seems to be a staple for rock groups to do a ballad, and even show off their softer side. Sometimes it comes off touching and sweet, sometimes darker and more haunting, and sometimes just plain amazing. See Hawk Nelson's brilliantly haunting \"Fourteen\" for case and point. But then again, sometimes it's just straight up ballad just for ballad's sake. Case in point, Secondhand Serenade's \"Fall For You.\"\n\nThis piano ballad is about as boring as it is emotionless and unoriginal, and believe me, this will cause you to fall asleep at the wheel. It may please any AC fan, or any fan of this type of song, but from a guy whose pretty much heard it all, I've heard this one before, and done a whole lot better. However, I may be a sucker for the piano, but the musical work here is pretty good.\n\nSo overall, from the vocals to the lyrics, A-Z, 1, 2, 3, this song doesn't do anything for me, except put me to sleep. The whole song was probably written to appease a record exec who wanted something to sell, which isn't bad, except when you put no work into it. Unoriginal and Boring are not desirable qualities I like in my music, so if you're into that, this is for you. I'll just keep my distance.","classification":2,"fold":4}

{"text":"I hesitate to call \"Black and Blue\" the beginning of the end for The Rolling Stones creatively, but it certainly does not ascend to the lofty heights of their 1968-72 output, nor is it even quite as good as \"Goat's Head Soup\" or \"It's Only Rock 'N' Roll,\" neither of which were masterpieces but were respectably solid efforts.\n\n\"Black and Blue\" was a transitional record for the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World. Mick Taylor, widely considered their best ever guitarist and a driving force behind their peak creative period, had left the band shortly after recording \"It's Only Rock 'n' Roll\" in 1974, and the next few months were spent searching for a new guitarist to fill what was a major musical void for the group. Candidates included Harvey Mandel (who actually plays on several tracks on \"B&B\") and even Eric Clapton, but the role wound up going to former Faces member Ron Wood, who joined the band in time for their 1975 tour.\n\n\"Black and Blue\" is one of their most experimental records as well, though that's not necessarily for the better in some cases. Funk and reggae were becoming major movements at the time, and Mick was especially swept up in it. Several of the album's tracks boast his fixation with the genres, but they unfortunately drag the album down in most instances. The opening number \"Hot Stuff,\" is built around a pleasant enough riff by Mandel and has a pretty catchy rhythm including some fine piano work, but lyrically it's the same chorus repeated over and over again followed by a sequence of Mick spouting out Jaggerisms in an embarassing faux Jamaican accent. This schtick is revisiting a few times throughout the record, most noticably the dreadful \"Cherry Oh Baby\" and the odd reggae \/ punk hybrid \"Hey Negrita.\"\n\nThe album's better tracks are worthy of recognition. \"Hand of Fate\" is a solid, gritty Stones rocker, as well as the most genuinely traditional Stones sounding track on the entire album. Mick delivers a punchy vocal and the band is well oiled and rocking. \"Memory Motel\" and the hit single \"Fool to Cry\" are both uncharacteristic, keyboard drenched power ballads that work better than they should considering their sappiness; the former has some great contributions from Keith on the bridge while the latter has Mick making great use of his falsetto. Finally, \"Melody\" is a playful, jazz infused number reminiscent of the previous album's \"Short and Curly.\"\n\n\"Black and Blue\" is by no means a masterpiece, and does indeed the first taste of the Stones past their peak, but there are enough good moments on it to make it a worthwhile listen.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"The Dark Crystal is an amazing movie set in a wonderfully realized alien world, and the soundtrack is a perfect fit for the movie. The movie is a fantasy tale of the highest order so the music demands grand themes and dynamic textures that compliment the scenery and emotion of the film. Again, this soundtrack delivers with a full orchestra giving the music vibrant life.\n\nYou want grandness? The main theme is as distinct and as enveloping as the best scores in film. I would put it up against the big name movie themes like Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, 2001's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and more. When I hear the main theme I instantly recognize it as the sweeping and dynamic score to The Dark Crystal. Other pieces like The Landstrider Journey bring that theme up to a level of excitement and momentum befitting of the scene it was made for. When our hero Jen sets off on his journey the music is sweeping and emotional just as the backdrop in the movie is breathtaking. There are about a half dozen pieces to the soundtrack right now that stick in my head in a very good way when I let it. The music is that memorable.\n\nSome other pieces of the film work with what I can best describe as old European instrumentation and themes, and again they work wonderfully. It gives an ethnic flavor to the scenes they are made for. More so the music, on its own, makes for some great songs to listen to. The Pod Dance is a high energy celebration type song with the flutes and guitar and other instruments giving a wonderful texture of sounds. Jen Plays His Pipes (exclusive to this CD) is a mellow and melodic dual wood flute piece and Gelfling Song adds a female tonal voice set in a more reflective tone.\n\nThe original soundtrack CD is great and comes with most of the most memorable music of the movie. However this limited edition set holds almost twice the music. Now that is not to say the single disk CD is not worth it. On the contrary the best music is on that CD, and if it weren't for the one song that I really wanted that the CD lacked (Jen Plays His Pipes) I would be putting my vote for that one. However not only does this edition have that one song I wanted it also have essentially the entire score to the film including incidental scoring and environmental sound bites.\n\nIf you like the music to The Dark Crystal this is the CD to shoot for. However if the price tag is too high for you to want to pay and just want the best of the movie's music then&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Dark-Crystal-25th-Anniversary\/dp\/B000QEILB0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Dark Crystal: 25th Anniversary<\/a>&nbsp;will do you fine.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I first heard Parquet Courts early last year and immediately bought a copy\nof all their releases, I can't decide whether Content Nausea or Sunbathing\nAnimal is my fave.

This\nalbum continues their streak of great releases although there are a few songs\nthat sound a bit tossed off (not always a bad thing). The good songs more than\nmake up for those; The Beck-ish hip hop of Captive Of The Sun, the fast and\npoignant Two Dead Cops and the epic One Man No City are at this point my\nfaves.

While this certainly isn't her best work, and it didn't receive much attention, its still a fun album to listen to. The songs are infectuous. The album is very Jackson sounding, with songs like Say You Do, Youll Never Find (A Love Like Mine) and Young Love, and theres also some ballads here like Love And My Best Friend, and Forever Yours.

{"text":"I have survived for almost 20 years strictly on Strange Brew - The Very Best Of. Then I realized that I don't have any of those long blues rock jams that they were famous for. Wheels Of Fire seemed like a good prospect to get the long live version of Spoonful, but I already had all of the other good songs. I kept looking and this very good compilation has all of Strange Brew and some more studio cuts on the first disc, with the second disc being all live to include the long version of Spoonful from Wheels Of Fire. The second live disc alone is worth the price of purchase. As for some of the studio cuts on the first disc that one never hears on the radio, well there is a good reason for that. These cuts only show how experimental this group got to be and that they also considered themselves to be a psychedelic band just as much as a blues rock jam band. It is a shame that they only lasted for a couple of years. It is hard to believe that these recordings are almost 50 years old.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"This album goes hard. It's classic Ghost, yet it's also something very different. Basically, it's a concept album with a plot that is equal parts the Crow, the Godfather trilogy, Italian giallo horror film, and Black Dynamite. Tone-wise, the vibe is a weird mash-up of classic Wu, classic Ghost, plus weird organs, operatic sounds, and a 70's soul-sploitation thing. And, miraculously, it all meshes together perfectly and the overall album has that cinematic, Cuban Linx I feel to it. Favorite cuts so far are \"I Declare War\" and \"Beware of the Stare,\" but it's all fire.\n\nBetween this and Czarface (not to mention a solid, if-less-superlative Cappadonna album), Wu is showing up in 2013. Honestly, I'd rather keep seeing this kind of inspired concept album stuff (thinking this and Czarface)than I would see a forced, rushed, underwhelming new full Wu-Tang Clan album. I'd love a new Wu album that lives up to the legacy, but I also like the new direction they're taking, and there have been plenty of solid Wu collaboration tracks over the last four years (including some good ones on this album).","classification":5,"fold":4}

But did have that taste of fame and song with her collaboration with the great Don Henley of The Eagles with Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough fro Patty's self-titled debut. The song is one of those guilty pleasure songs that I still enjoy listening to heart and soul, that still ignites with sadness and heart. It is just a shame though that Patty has never been able to try and make another song ignite after that one.

{"text":"I really had my mind set on this debut from her, I've loved her since American Idol and saw both of the movies she was in: Sex & The City & DreamGirls. She can sing and she can act, so when i got wind of a definite release date on her debut, I was soooo excited. I got over the fact that they wasted a track on rehashing the song from Dreamgirls. If they really wanted to blow me away, they should've made it a duet with her and Jennifer Holliday, no holds barred singing either.  Spotlight grew on me and I ended up singing it around the house when there was no music playing at all. I got over the album cover and I got over her fake forced laugh at 106 and that sudden engagement to a reality tv star (not her boyfriend since high school). This girl has chops but when it came to the album, the material wasn't as strong. It reminded of not only the \"too-much hype\" theory but also it sounded like a record by an artist who didn't have good material to work with which seems to be more the cause of first class divas that have been around a long time (Patti Labelle, albums in the 90's). Pocketbook is a really good jam but came off like a \"we've got to put a hood jam on here\". Some of the songs came off to Idol-y to me, She could've did better without T-Pain instead getting a more capable male duet singer like Babyface, Jahiem or Raheem Devaughn who can rift and melisma like no other male singer. The whole vocal machine thing is tired; Only Zapp can pull that off and do it well, and maybe Teddy Riley. She did really good on \"Jesus Has A Home For Me Over There\" but she didn't blow me away. She was pretty underwhelming on the Diane Warren song. However, the song she did with Fantasia is on point; That was one of few highlights on the album and I think if she did an entire album around that sound of old school r&b, she would have gotten a solid 5. It had that \"Woman 2 Woman\" feel to it and Fantasia is the only other female artist that can hold her own against Jennifer. It still gives me chills. It's too many misses for me and it didn't smesh well. I really tried one night to play this through and through and like it really hard, but I wasn't really impressed.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"Despite having a completely new line-up than the one that recorded the first part of the \"Keeper Of The Seven Keys\" series eighteen years ago, \"Keeper Of The Seven Keys: The Legacy\" marks something of a return to form for German power metal primitives\/pioneers Helloween. Bursting at the seems with all of the good stuff that is regularly found in PM -- i.e. strong hooks, crunchy guitar licks, wailing solos, Bruce Dickinson-inspired singing, etc. -- this 2005 effort breaks absolutely no new ground for the band or genre. But it is still a really darn good and impossible to dislike one, nonetheless.\n\nSo now that we have established how excellent \"The Legacy\" is, it should also be noted how epic it is. It is a sprawling, seventy-seven minute-long affair spread out over the course of thirteen tracks and two discs. And while Helloween's Iron Maiden and Judas Priest influences might be as strong as ever, here, the band still manages to somehow possess their own unique sound. It is much more ambitious and progressive than anything that either of those two bands had successfully attempted to date (prior to the year 2005).\n\nAfter a lengthy, drawn-out, and really ominous intro, opener \"The King For A Thousand Years\" kicks up a thrashy groove with speedy double bass thudding, soaring melodic vocals, crunchy speed metal riffing, and galloping beats. From there, things do proceed to get a little mellow, as the song adopts a nice, twin-guitar harmony section, flashy soloing, and pretty acoustic bridge; but this fourteen minute-long epic finally picks back up again to galloping speed metal territory (iced with Maiden-inspired singing and aggressive tempo'ing). The next track, \"The Invisible Man,\" begins with an excellent, and highly technical slapped bass solo that flows into highly energetic and crunchy proto-thrash riffing, twiddly guitar soloing, and steady, humming bass lines. The guitar solo work is very lengthy, sustained, epic, and air-guitar-able in this song, but it also features some memorably falsetto vocal hooks, and prog-ish synth soloing.\n\nNext comes \"Born On Judgment Day,\" which kicks off with another tricky bass intro before settling into a propulsive, Motorhead-esque double-bass-aided speed metal groove. This highly technical and complex mini-epic finds everybody getting in on the action, as it also boasts a nimble, skillful mid-song drum solo, followed by a bass solo, and more delicious, shred-happy guitar solo work. \"Pleasure Drone,\" then, is another equally-as-large standout, as it is a bass-heavy song with prominent, muscularly grumbling bass lines flowing throughout. It, however, is also highlighted by solid guitar leads, and great, epically high-flying solo flights. The remaining two songs on the first disc are two other considerably large standouts, as \"Mrs. God\" boasts huge, infectiously catchy choruses, and technical, mid-song bass soloing, while \"Silent Rain\" is a piece of pure, straight-up Eighties thrash metal, through and through. It is backed by ripping, wah-tinged soloing, forceful double bass heft, and crunching, rigid, chainsaw-fast guitar picking\n\nThe second disc is a little inconsistent, but certainly not without some charm. It opens with the very catchy and groove-happy \"Occasion Avenue.\" This song can claim to have substantial merit, as it does feature choral-esque chanting vocals, propulsive thrash beats, grumbling bass lines, crunching guitar licks, and soaring guitar harmonies -- and although plenty of soulful, falsetto vocal hooks find their way into the mix, here, too -- but on the whole, it is just a so-so song. Clocking in at over eleven minutes in length, it does get a little boring and unnecessarily repetitive. And \"Light The Universe\" is also the source of some drag, as it is a slow, and even kind of plodding, piano-aided power ballad. (Although it does score a few merit points for featuring guest female vocals from Blackmore Night's Candice Night.)\n\nFear not, though, because the memorably muscular \"Do You Know What You're Fighting 4?\" kicks the energy level up way high again, as it is a chunky number with clearly Megadeth-ian riffing, and rhythmic, galloping beats. Also included here are an excellent, dazzling, wailing, trade-off solo section, and an empowering, and nearly anthemic chorus. And \"Come Alive\" is another very thrashy piece, although it is preceded by the seriously-proggy \"Shade In The Shadow,\" a song that, with its infectiously melodic and falsetto vocal hooks, and good, prog-ish soloing, ends up sounding not unlike some Dream Theater tunes. Back on the downside again, \"Get It Up\" is, unfortunately, a mostly unremarkable inclusion. But, it, again, is followed-up by another beaming moment of potential, this one coming in the form of \"My Life For One More Day,\" which is a very propulsive album closer with tasty, crunchy riffing and immediately catchy and memorable sing\/chant-along vocals out the yin-yang.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you have not already been charmed or coerce into liking Helloween (and if you haven't, what the heck is the matter with you?!), \"Keeper Of The Seven Keys: The Legacy\" is not likely to change your mind. But longtime Helloween fans should feel anything but let down with this latest installment. So make sure there is plenty of room left in your C.D. collection\/shelf to add this epically epic prog\/power metal opus to it.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Picking up where The Soul Tape 3's \"Young OG\" left off, Fabolous's sixth studio album, The Young OG Project, which is obviously named after that song, unveils a lot more of Fab's classic, punchline-driven wit and clever lyricism, as he discusses navigating life's hurdles and especially the round-about, fair-weather individuals met along the way. Fab's rap style is still very much there and intact, and much emphasis is placed on the man's personal feelings and experiences. A few moments spread positive messages, namely reaching high, moving on and healthy fathering (\"Young OG II\"), and even when Fabolous is critical and distrustful of ne'er-do-wells and his detractors, he has a great sense of karma, doling out just deserts, rarely sounding cruel, cold or cynical. His tried and true capo-style comes out in lines about bad b*tches, posh fashion, the \"gun shop\" and his \"shooters,\" but he has left out the dope-dealing aspects, probably for the better. Appropriate for the season, \"Ball Drop\" celebrates starting the new year afresh by severing toxic relationships. Fab's intentions for this album were \"90s inspired and themed\" and nothing exemplifies the influence more than all the famous hip hop samples, quotes, name-drops and sound bites tossed in the mix. They have a strong New York-hip hop flavor to them and pay homage to Jay-Z, Nas and the Notorious B.I.G. especially. The music production as a whole, which is supplied by a melange of great producers, is cool and chill but even Fabolous can't escape the ubiquitous drill beat of modern-age trap. Truth be told, from the right vantage point, they're actually quite tasteful. Aside from Fabolous, The Young OG Project features some talented, new rappers and singers instead of veteran artists from Fab's heyday, giving it a fresh, up to date feel (no disrespect to the rap game's vets). Young OG may not be Loso's Way 2, but it's traditional Fabolous with a contemporary twist. It has all the fabulous musical style, quality lyricism and urban, street flourishes that fans have come to expect from the Brooklyn emcee.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"Heartthrob is the awesome new album from Canadian twins Tegan and Sara that mixes their heartfelt lyrics with killer vocal arrangements and some really amazing electronic production techniques. Production was mainly handled by Greg Kurstin who has had major success with Kelly Clarkson and Pink and he is clearly the driving force behind the polished sound on this album. Highlights include the very catchy opening track \"Closer\", the emotional chorus of \"Goodbye, Goodbye\", the epic build up of \"I Was A Fool\" which sounds like it has a very strong Roxette influence, the upbeat groove of \"Drove Me Wild\", the driving chorus of \"How Come You Don't Want Me\", and the emotional lyrics of \"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\" that describes a regretful lost love. At just under forty minutes, Heartthrob is a very tight album full of great songs and memorable vocal melodies that always ends too soon after each listen. Some fans might not warm to the big shift in heavy production but it really does feel like these songs have been enhanced and made bigger than they were initially intended. Heartthrob is highly recommended to fans of bands such as Roxette and Secondhand Serenade and anyone that loves their music laced with glossy production. By the way, I was lucky enough to see this album performed by Tegan and Sara with their great band recently at The Sydney Opera House and it was brilliant.","classification":5,"fold":4}

I love the hardcore rock anthems NIN has produced, but sometimes I HAVE to listen to some of their softer and\/or mostly instrumental tracks (for example: A Warm Place from The Downward Spiral). I'm a person that works with a computer all day, so many times these tracks are much more conducive to working than distracting harder\/louder tracks...so when I seen this was out, I was over the moon about it!\n\nI have not been disappointed.

I'm a fan of the abstract and artsy stuff (one of the reasons I'm a NIN fan in the first place) so I really dig what has been done...and I love HOW it's been done. We've all known of Trent's resentment and battles with the record industry - but the way he's selling\/distributing this work is Grade A. There are lots of options and the consumers and artists are all happy - not just the record company. $5 is an insanely great price for this, there is no excuse out there not to pick it up (and I'm really excited that so many people have embraced this distribution method AND the music).

With lyrics like \"You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter...like a hard candy with a surprise center\", she shows her depth as a songwriter.  But most impressive is the showcasing of her incredible vocal talent...something kept hidden on her previous singles.  From soft and sensual with a beautiful falsetto, to strong and pure, and everything in between, this girl's got it.  At times her tone and delivery are reminiscent of Alanis Morissette, but I'm sure Katy wouldn't mind being compared to her.

{"text":"This album shows what truly made the Bee Gees great and that they stood on their own merit of great songs and wonderful productions.  This album is their Crowning Achievement of the 4 they would release in the 1960's in only a short 2 year period!  This remaster was done wonderfully and even has the original red velvet cover with the big gold lettering of the original.  As an earlier reviewer stated, this album definitely got the royal treatment!  From a historical perspective, Odessa was such a strong statement by the band and was one of three epic double albums released that year by a British Band, the other 2 being \"Tommy\" by the Who and \"White\" album as it's called by the Beatles.\n\nAlthough never really thought of in this way, the Bee Gees were a part of the last wave of the \"British Invasion\" bands and were, even at their young age, contemporaries of the other bands such as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Who, Yardbirds, etc.  This album was the one that there manager, Robert Stigwood, really wanted to be a kind of \"statement\" album.  The band was growing up and their songs and sound, already incredible, were becoming more mature and evolving.  The comparisions to the Beatles have always been uncalled for in my opinion as I have always felt that the brothers had a sound and style of writing that was uniquely theirs.\n\nBarry & Robin Gibb, in my opinion, were every bit the writers as Lennon\/McCartney or Townshend\/Entwhistle and this album is proof of how intricate and diverse their songs could be.  The epic title track shows their strong ability to \"story tell\" as they take us on a journey across the atlantic ocean.  Then you have songs with a country fell such as \"Marley Purt Drive\" to the folk sounding \"Melody Fair\" to the bouncy \"Suddenly\" amongst others.  Maurice Gibbs wonderful talent for writing melodies and being able to play multiple instruments really comes through strong as well.\n\nThis album really showed that the \"boys\" were growing up musically, at the time of its release, Barry was 22 and Robin and Maurice 19.  Unfortunately, after the release of this album, problems arose to the point that Robin left the band and the next album was recorded without him.  Fortunately for us, their fans, he would return after a brief hiatus and they would then begin the second phase of their incredible careers.  That being said, Odessa was truly the Crown Jewel of the early phase of their careers and a wonderful album, fresh and clean, all these years later.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"This album is produced by Wilcos Jeff Tweedy at the Loft Studio in Chicago  and some may wonder what he could possibly bring to Richard Thompson's British folk-rock oeuvre but I think that he does a great job, freeing Richard to concentrate on his own songwriting and playing.  For me this is Richards best album for years with great songs and great playing - it reminds me a bit of Shoot Out the Lights but without the bitterness of that album - there is no real obvious American influence (apart from a general bluesiness) and Richards lyrics are still very much redolent of England.\n\nFrom the first track She Never Could Resist a Winding Road you know this is a good un,  rocky but with the British folk roots clearly showing through.  Sima Cunninghams wonderful backing vocals underline Richards own voice and did bring back pleasant memories of Linda at times.  There is wonderful guitar playing throughout, both acoustic and electric, with Guitar Heroes being Richards tribute to his influences, including Les Paul, Django Reinhardt, Chuck Berry, James Burton and Hank Marvin. Richards rhythm section of Taras Prodaniuk on bass and Michael Jerome on drums support him perfectly and both Tweedy and Jim Elkington also add guitar.\n\nFor me the outstanding tracks were the aforementioned She Never Could Resist a Winding Road, Beatnik Walking, All Buttoned Up, Pony in the Stable (which reminded me of Full House-era Fairports) ditto No Peace No End.  However, this is a very consistent album with all the other tracks not far behind and it also has a very pleasing mix of acoustic and electric, fast and slow, happy and sad and it must surely go down as one of the high water marks of his long and productive career.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"In 1968 \"Super Session\" helped take rock & roll to a whole new level. It pushed the envelope passed the 2 and 3 minute danceable pop songs, creating a longer more progressive rock pallet, paying more attention to technical and subtle aspects of the music. The three musicians that created the super group, Al Kooper (piano\/organ\/ondioline\/vocals\/guitars - Blood Sweat & Tears), Mike Bloomfield (guitar - Bob Dylan's \"Highway 61 Revisited\", Electric Flag), and Stephen Stills (guitar - Crosby, Stills Nash [& Young], Buffalo Springfield), were all \"on hiatus\" from their most recent engagements. The three of them never actually played \"together\", instead it was split into sets of Kooper\/Bloomfield and the other by Kooper\/Stills. The band was backed by a powerful rhythm section as well, Harvey Brooks (bass - Miles Davis, Bob Dylan's \"Highway 61 Revisited\") and Eddie Hoh (drums - The Monkees) as well as Barry Goldberg (electric piano - Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels, Electric Flag).\n\nThe heavy Electric Chicago blues works beautifully on the Kooper\/Bloomfield originals, \"Albert's Shuffle\", \"Stop\", and \"Man's Temptation\". The arrangements are precise, fluid and melodic. Kooper's organ solos provide a groovy melodic edge to the music. \"Man's Temptation\" is a very soulful number, reminiscent of Blood, Sweat & Tears. The 9 minute trippy waltz of \"His Holy Modal Majesty\" features the longest jam on the Kooper\/Bloomfield side. The track also features Koopers electric keyboard-manipulated ondioline, sounding kind of like a tenor sax, although very unique.\n\nDue to health issues, Bloomfield was unable to finish the recording of \"Super Session\". This is where Steven Stills came in. He's first heard on a rendition of Bob Dylan's \"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\". Still's biggest highlight on the album and a personal favorite of mine is \"Season of the Witch\". This 11 minute epic song displays the boiling chemistry Kooper and Stills have working together, offering inspired interaction between the two. \"You Don't Love Me\" allows Stills to play some heavy amplified distorted lead guitar, sounding a bit like Jimi Hendrix.\n\nThis is one of those albums that age very well. Upon my first listen roughly a year ago, I was blown away at how fresh it sounded after all these years. It is unlike anything I've ever heard, offering influence in a big way to the Electric Chicago blues and rock and roll movement. I am very pleased to say that the remastered version of this album, done by Al Kooper himself, sounds awesome, loud and clear. That's something that fans of the original vinyl release will be anxious to snatch up.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"The popular American actress and singer Debbie Reynolds broke into show business at the tender age of 19 back in 1950 with her portrayal of singer Helen Kane in the feature film \"Three Little Words\".  Her performance earned her a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer.  Just a few months later Debbie would score a Top Ten hit with her first single \"Aba Daba Honeymoon\".  And after her memorable performance in the 1952 musical comedy \"Singin\" In The Rain\" with Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor the name Debbie Reynolds would be forever etched in the folklore of Hollywood.  Given her vocal prowess many people expected Debbie Reynolds to become a fixture on the Billboard pop charts.  You might be surprised to learn that this simply was not the case.\n\nIt would be another five years and 14 films before Debbie Reynolds would have another hit record.  It does not appear that a recording career was a top priority for her.  In 1957 she co-starred with Leslie Nielson and Walter Brennan in the romantic comedy \"Tammy And The Bachelor\".  The song \"Tammy\" made its debut in that film and was nominated for the 1957 Academy Award for Best Original Song.  The tune was a massive hit with the record-buying public as well.  \"Tammy\" would remain on the Billboard Hot 100 for an unheard of 31 weeks and spend 5 big weeks at the top of the charts.  Over the next couple of years Debbie Reynolds would have a couple of more hits but nothing could compare with the popularity of \"Tammy\".  i suppose that in this day and age most people would consider a song like \"Tammy\" to be pure unadulterated schmaltz.  But in my opinion, there is something to be said for such schmaltz.  Even as a teenager in the 1960's I loved this song.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"This 1963 album is one of the best examples of flawless bossa nova music to date. Stan Getz playing the saxophone, Joao Gilberto on guitar and Antonio Carlos Jobim on piano blend simultaneously into a uniquely talented trio of musicians as their hearts and minds create one exquisite song after another.\n\nAs another reviewer correctly notes, most of the songs on this CD were written by Antonio Carlos Jobim. He remains one of the most gifted musicians and composers to this day. I also especially liked Astrud Gilberto's singing in \"The Girl From Ipanema\" and \"Corcovado (Quiet Nights Of Quiet Stars).\" Yes, Astrud sometimes sang flat; but it is no matter here. It works beautifully to have her singing along with the music.\n\nAnother plus about this CD is the addition of two tracks that were not available on the original LP release: the 45 rpm issues of \"The Girl From Ipanema\" and \"Corcovado (Quiet Nights Of Quiet Stars.)\" I really liked comparing the shorter 45 rpm versions to the original, longer versions of both songs.\n\nThe sound quality was very good but not quite perfect. There is a slight hissing in the background especially when I hear the saxophone being played solo by Getz. I looked in the liner notes and they do mention that there was some \"tape delamination\" on track five (\"Corcovado\") and that \"some of the master takes have been faded longer or later than they were on the original LP issue.\" I wonder if this had anything to do with what I heard. In addition, the liner notes also offer a great essay by Doug Ramsey as well as the original liner notes for the LP. There are beautiful photos of Getz, Gilberto and Astrud.\n\nThis is a wonderful album to relax with or to play while you entertain company for dinner. The experience is sophisticated stylishness! The fact that most of the lyrics are in Portuguese is not a concern for those who do not understand the language; the music is so beautiful and the lyrics are so poetic anyway that the overall listening experience is memorable. Not only is this music timeless, it is so well performed with each and every subtle nuance that it possesses a universal appeal decades after its' release.\n\nHighly recommended for bossa nova fans, fans of great Latin music and people who crave international music.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Malaysian singer Yunalis Zara'ai - or simply, Yuna - almost became a lawyer instead of a singer. She had dreams of wanting to have a recording career, but thought it might have been a little unrealistic. By the time she was ready to graduate from college, she started slowly taking an interest in having a music career. She recorded an EP and later signed through Fader Magazine's independent label imprint. Through that label, she released two albums: \"Decorate\" for her homeland and her self-titled debut for the English market in 2012. The album contained the Pharrell Williams produced single \"Live Your Life\", which got her enough recognition to appear on late night shows by Jimmy Kimmel and Conan O'Brien. She then signed with legendary jazz label Verve Records for the release of her major label debut \"Nocturnal\", which featured production from the  likes of Chad Hugo, Sa-Ra Creative Partners' Om'Mas Keith, Incubus guitarist Michael Eizenger and Robin Hannibal of the duo Quadron. Although she's long been a critical darling to most music fans, she had yet to secure a hit - which leads to her next recording.\n\nIn 2016, she released her third effort \"Chapters\". The record was primarily inspired by a breakup with her longtime boyfriend, who things went south with after their relocation to Los Angeles, California after Yuna wanted to further her music career. This time around, she makes a beeline toward the neo-soul audience with her sound while having production from Fisticuffs (best known for their work with Miguel), David Foster and the aforementioned Robin Hannibal. She begins the album with the indifference toward a significant other on \"Mannequin\". On the ballad \"Lanes\", she chastises a lover who would rather do hard partying instead of putting his relationship first. She collaborates with Usher on her breakthrough single \"Crush\" and duets with Jhene Aiko on the mid-tempo ballad \"Used to Love You\". She tries to deal with a man who's reluctant to settle down and enter a relationship on \"Unrequited Love\". Yuna also takes the reins by wanting to get serious about commitment on \"Best Love\" and gets reluctant to be in a relationship due to being hurt in the past on \"Too Close\". She tries to instill pride and self-esteem in a significant other on \"Best Of Me\" and makes an attempt to get through a breakup on \"Your Love\". Lastly, she closes the album with the ballad \"All I Do\" where she tries to put her best foot forward after the demise of a relationship. \"Chapters\" is a great album from Yuna that balances her artistry with broader commercial appeal. If she keeps on this path that she is currently heading towards, there is a good chance that she may become a household name and an even bigger star.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I first found out about this amazing duo by chance in 2012.  I was walking in a bookstore when I heard a song that instantly struck me in awe almost putting me in a trance standing there.  I used a music recognition app to find out that it was 'Wild' by Beach House.  So I bought the album Bloom and have listened to it at least 30 times since.  It was one of the most beautiful albums I've ever heard.  I instantly compared them to Cocteau Twins, another great and similar band from the 80s\/90s.  Of course I listened to the bands earlier work too and found favorites in Teen Dream and Devotion but I ultimately still named Bloom as my favorite so far.  So during the 3 years since I would periodically look into whether the band was releasing a new album to no avail.  I almost forgot about them when suddenly they released the song 'Sparks' and news of a new album in the Fall of 2015.  I was intrigued also by the title.  When they said they were going back to basics I was still excited but somewhat hesitant as I loved their lush sound from Bloom most.  I made myself not listen to anymore songs released before the album so that the feeling of discovery with each track was much more sincere, especially since there are only 9 songs.  Well when I finally purchased the CD and held the smooth velvet case in my hands I knew I was in for something extra special.  I was right.  After multiple listens so far, here is a track by track review of one of the most beautiful and emotional albums I've heard.\n\n1.  Levitation: This song slowly builds up the atmosphere with keyboards and minor drum beats.  Victorias angelic vocals glide through.  At first I didn't think the singing was as good as others but after repeated listens I found myself singing 'Theres a place I want to take you' in my head.  The second half features an emotional guitar croon that creeps in perfectly to complete the soundscape before fading away nicely.  The title of the song explains how it feels listening to this perfectly.  Amazing opener.  10\/10\n2.  Sparks: The lead single.  At first I wasn't that impressed.  But the song just kept getting better and better.  It is a very spacey song that again sounds just as the title implies.  The vocals in the first half remind me of M83.  Then toward the end Victorias distinct lullaby style brings it to a close.  The main riff is so alluring.  By the time the main riff repeats itself one final time it sounds like a friend departing whom you wished would stay longer.  Each time I listen to this song I feel like I'm saying goodbye to someone I love.  It's so profound the way music can make you feel.  Especially when done right like this.  10\/10\n3.  Space Song: This sounds like it could've been on Bloom.  I fell in love with this at first listen and it has only grown more and more on me.  It's just so great all around.  The main riff on this one is so gorgeous it's hard to describe.  I would have to say it sounds tragically beautiful.  Like endlessly floating through the night while the one you love is floating a distance in front of you that you can never catch up to.  I know, it sounds depressing, but not in the mopey way at all.  Oh and Victorias vocals of course are so sensual and perfect.  This is a new favorite.  This is one of those songs I could  never get tired of.  11\/10\n4.  Beyond Love: Another song with a tragic beauty in its sound as if the title didn't hint at it.  The lyrics are so eerie yet delivered so smoothly.  Victoria really is beyond human in her vocal abilities.  The main riff is sad in a good way.  Think of your lover or the one that got away while listening.  Or just relax and enjoy.  Another great track.  9.5\/10\n5.  10:37: The beginning drums sound like the introduction to a ceremony.  Then the vocals slowly soar through the song.  This one keeps that Cocteau Twins comparison strong.  Such a relaxing song.  The guitar are so simple yet elegantly great.  I always picture myself floating down a mystic river on giant lily pads staring up at the stars when listening to this.  But thats just me.  Great playful relaxation song.  9.5\/10\n6.  PPP: This song.  Wow.  The main riff.  The way Victoria talks seductively in the beginning before singing so beautifully that I feel like I'm drowning in divine delight.  The melody of this song can either make you cry or feel exceptionally happy, or both.  The eerie guitar solo is just so beautiful gorgeous haunting elegant.  I can't even really put to words how it makes me feel.  This song is sure to be a emotional roller coaster throughout the years.  This one is an instant classic.  If I was a filmmaker I'd want this to be in my movie.  11\/10\n7.  Wildflower: The synth and guitar in this one brings to mind the 80s.  A quick but twinkling song that I wish was twice as long.  Just sit back and let this one guide your thoughts.  Another relaxation gem.  9.5\/10\n8.  Bluebird: Another one that I strongly wish was longer.  This is a jam.  Everything is perfect again.  The drums.  The staccato style guitars that just glide through the chorus.  The keyboards.  Victorias heavenly croon.  I am constantly amazed with this one.  This is the sound definition of good music.  Love it.  10.5\/10\n9.  Days Of Candy:  I read that the band used a choir of 24 for this song and it really shows.  The beginning is slow and haunting in the way she sings.  Then the drums quietly kick in with some great emotional guitars.  The final 2 minutes of the song are the best.  It sounds like 3 seperate songs yet one song at the same time.  Such a great and endearing way to close this emotional masterpiece of an album.  10\/10\n\nDare I say it?  I think I like this album more than Bloom.  Thats just my personal opinion.  I am still in awe just thinking of the way this album moved me.  I've listened to many albums of many genres throughout the years but I can't say any have struck me like this.  As I said, tragic beauty is present in almost all tracks.  Finding love, losing love.  Happiness, depression.  Relaxation, pure ecstasy.  This album somehow combines all of that in its craft.  Part of me hopes they don't release another album in a while so I can enjoy this even more.  I almost have this irrational fear that they will release an album that I will like more.  I feel like I have found a perfect album.  Of course many will strongly disagree.  But this is my opinion.  Maybe you won't feel the same way whether you love this album or not.  But I highly recommend you listen to the album at least 3 times before you form your full opinion.  Hearing this album gave me the feeling of wondering how I lived all those prior years without it.  Though I'm sure this album will be great year round I think that it is the perfect soundtrack for the Autumn season the most.  This is also one of those albums that really needs to be purchased physically.  You cannot fully experience the album without feeling the smooth red velvet that the CD is wrapped in.  If you already love Beach House, then you need to get this now.  If you're new to the band then prepare yourself for a beauty in music you've probably never heard before.  Do the ears of the world a favor and spread this music to as many people as you can!  I will be cherishing this album till the day I die.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Alternative, conscious hip hop can be approached from many angles, which is why it's glaring when styles are reused without expounding on, extrapolating from or offering solutions to the source issues. In the Words Paint Pictures EP, Rapper Big Pooh (of Durham, North Carolina trio Little Brother fame) and Detroit producer Apollo Brown have come together with the spirit of Mello Music Group to once again describe what they feel are the most exigent problems in society now, namely police-on-black violence, federal government wrongdoing and the prison industrial complex as a second ghetto for blacks.\n\nAll of those moving parts, which blossom from Pooh's golden rapping voice box, play out to the backdrop of Brown's sample-based soul beats, which are nice as always but show little innovative growth and bring to life few new ideas or techniques, just nice new samples. Give him some time though. Brown's a good beat maker.\n\nWords Paint Pictures is regrettably a little one dimensional, and Big Pooh makes hay of a racially beleaguered America, even if his critique on the public sector with Ras Kass is excellent. After \"Promise Land,\" the EP settles into fresh rhymes and cold chillin'. There are nine songs total, but the last two are remixes leaving seven \"originals.\" Other guests besides Ras Kass include Steve Roxx, Eric \"Blakk Soul\" Keith, Marv Won, L'Orange and an awesomely lyrical triplet of Jalen Santoy, Novej and Lute in \"Kings.\"\n\nIt would have been nice to hear Big Pooh suggest curative measures of conduct to combat the flaws of our current social order and system, but his questioning mentality and healthy skepticism are appreciated nonetheless. Likewise, Apollo Brown simply rolls out his music loops rarely with a surprise moment in the fold, but even if it is within a familiar comfort zone that he produces, the beats still possess harmonious, throwback beauty.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"The album of the same name was released in 1984. Notably, this song is the full length version, not one of those chopped or butchered follow up versions, usually used by radio stations. There is not much I can add to who and what Prince Rodgers Nelson was. Any additional remarks on my part would be quite redundant. I bought the vinyl album back then and played it frequently using high end turntables connected to an audiophile grade system. Years later, I switched to high end CD players and improved analog system technology. I briefly owned the virtual Red Book CD. It sounded just as good as the vinyl, actually cleaner and with improved dynamic range. The MP3 sound quality of this version is amazingly good for this type of format. The DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) I use offsets some of the MP3 file shortfalls, so I am happy with this file. I love the song.","classification":5,"fold":4}

For Aloe Blacc to breakout in real soul, he showed that well when he released The Man earlier this year, but the big question is how can he follow-up such a great sampled song. His latest song, Love Is The Answer, the second single from his second album Lift Your Spirit, isn't as strong as was with The Man. His voice at times within the song sounds shallow and out of tune to the song. I was shocked, compared to his past songs like I Need A Dollar. It almost sounded like he needs to fine tune his heartstrings and find his heart again.

{"text":"Christmastime is upon us once again.  We hold what is near and dear close to us, spend time with special people and glory in a time of year where hopefully people are trying to be better to one another.  It is also the time of year for Christmas cds.  Almost every singer seems to have one.  What sets them apart?  It is totally the intent behind it.  It's a quick money maker for some and then you have those who truly love the season and want to use their craft to share their feelings with others.  That is what Jessica does here.  I own many Christmas cds and after only the first listen this one is my favorite.  This is a mature Jessica singing classic songs with respect, singing some new songs with happiness and the listener can't help but get in the spirit.  One often forgets that Jessica started out as purely a singer and she possessed an awesome vocal range and tackled songs from pop, ballads and gospel with pure emotion.  This is a talented woman.  She then had some commercial releases and now she has a gift for us.  She returns to the roots of her talent, her pure and strong vocals.\n\nThe cd opens like holiday magic with MY ONLY WISH.  It sets the holiday tone and it never lets up.  She puts magic into pop classics like SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN and HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS.  She treats the spiritual classics O COME O COME EMMANUEL and MARY DID YOU KNOW with much respect.  The instrumentation on this whole cd is great but in the forefront are Jessica's beautiful vocals.  No gimmicks.  Just heartfelt emotions and her vocal talent and range in full display.  Her joy for this season is very apparent.  She cowrote MY ONLY WISH and KISS ME FOR CHRISTMAS.  CAROLS OF THE BELLS is awe-inspiring with perfect vocals from Jessica used throughout.  She sings the lead and her voice is used for all the background vocals including the bells.  Exsquisite and heartwarming.  And we get the sexy, fun Jessica on MERRY CHRISTMAS BABY sung with Willie Nelson.\n\nThere are two bonus tracks here - JINGLE BELL ROCK and SILENT NIGHT.  Bottom line, Jessica puts her heart and soul into this cd.  She belts with heart and carefully caresses where need be.  Her vocals are exsquisite whatever the type of song.  She has never sounded better.  So cuddle with your loved one, put up the tree or have a hot mug of your favorite beverage and put on Jessica.  She will bring joy, emotion and the true feelings of the holidays into whatever you are doing.  I give the highest kudos to Jessica.  I planned on liking this cd but am thrilled that it has instead become a classic that will be a part of every holiday season for me from now on.  Highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Where Have I Known You Before proves to me once AGAIN exactly how much different (and better) jazz from the 70's was. This is *phenomenal* instrumental playing.\n\nIt's not ordinary by any stretch of the imagination. These band members had a unique ability to really make you open your mind and appreciate instrumental chops played tastefully and creatively, and chops that are constantly full of passion and energy.  You feel like you're getting a complete experience when you hear albums like this one.\n\nThis is perhaps one of the finest recordings from the mid 70's you will ever hear, right next to the Mahavishnu Orchestra's Visions of the Emerald Beyond.  I seriously mean that.  Yes, I've heard quite a bit of albums around the same time Where Have I Known You Before was released, and despite the fact this album wasn't exactly popular doesn't really MEAN anything when it comes down to it.  What matters is that I've heard the album, and I'm trying my best to convince YOU why you need to hear it.\n\nThe fact that instrumental skills of THIS caliber actually exist, and have been laid down on tape for this recording, really proves to me Return to Forever were more than just a talented group of fellows. This is a band that really gave listeners a challenging and lasting experience.\n\nThe keyboard playing is a constant feature of the album. Tastefully played, engaging, and always being displayed in a way that proves the keyboard player is giving everything he has and then some. The guitar playing is the same way. More passion than most guitar players would be able to lay down, that's for sure.\n\nAgain I have to ask the magic question- THIS is jazz?  The lengthy and intense keyboard and guitar jams that come and go are considered jazzy?  Are you sure this kind of music doesn't belong in the rock camp? Perhaps rock fusion is the appropriate choice of words.\n\nThe album cover shows a sun appearing in a hazy red sky. The only thing hazy about these compositions are the images you get in your head. The music is certainly nothing hazy, or unorganized, or played lazily, or ANYTHING like that- this is just a straight up perfect example of jazz that at one point in time wasn't afraid to be as experimental as possible.\n\nDoes Where Have I Known You Before leave a lasting impression? You BET it does. A positive one at that. I'm more than happy giving an album with such brilliant instrumental playing a perfect 5 stars. Replay value is important to me as well, and this album most certainly delivers in that respect.\n\nIf you're someone just getting into jazz and would like to hear a fantastic piece of music, check out THIS album. You will be blown away by many moments among all the instrumental jams, I guarantee it.  You simply must check out the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Jade Warrior, Camel and Santana as well because these bands have their fair share of music focusing on jazzy and tasteful instrumental chops as well.","classification":5,"fold":4}
{"text":"I have several Steve Winwood CDs, which admiddetly I don't play much anymore. But when I recently saw this CD in a second-hand store cheap I couldn't resist. I mean, I used to LOVE this album when it originally came out in 1980. I played it over and over in those days.\n\"Arc of a Diver\" (7 tracks, 40 min.) contains the hits \"While You See a Chance\" and \"Second-Hand Woman\", and the title track is well known too, but it all sounds a bit... 80s synth-lite now. The only track that really remains a stand-out now is the brooding, grooving \"Night Train\".\nThis album set the stage for the commercial blockbusters \"Back in the High Life\" and \"Roll With It\". With the hind-sight of 20 years or so, it is strangely clear to me that Steve Winwood's solo output simply hasn't aged well. It was exciting music then, but isn't now, sorry.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"I have to admit that, at first, I was slightly disappointed that we were getting yet another '77 show as there's so much from that era released already. On top of that, a few weeks before this was announced, an upgrade for this show had popped up into circulation. However, that momentary disappointment quickly passed as this is one of the best shows from 1977. The Dead were actually hired to play the school's Homecoming dance. The show opens with a cool Bertha with Jerry getting in a massive guitar solo before hitting a pumped up Good Lovin'.\n\nStandout versions of Brown-Eyed Women, Cassidy, It Must Have Been The Roses, Sunrise and even New Minglewood Blues follow. Dupree's is a nice rarity although this version is a little sluggish and Jerry forgets a few words here and there. The first set comes to a close with a screaming  Let It Grow. The second set begins with Phil's goofy Jones Gang Introduction before getting down to business with a rocking Samson And Delilah->Cold, Rain And Snow. The second set jam has a great run of Playing In The Band->Eyes Of The World->Estimated Prophet->Drums->Iko Iko->Stella Blue->Playing In The Band. The Eyes is fast paced for the era whereas Iko Iko is one of the most laid back. The show ends with a nice Johnny B. Goode.\n\nAs an extra, the third disc is filled with a large chunk of 11-2-77 at the Field House at Seneca College. Other parts of the Seneca show had been used as bonus songs on Dick's Picks 34 which featured the entire 11-5-77 Community War Memorial Auditorium show.

They still stick to their trademark style with some tweeks here and there. Which are the ingredients for a fine, rock album.

{"text":"There really have not been all that many songs that have really drove from the world of country music the past several years. The songs have either been gently from one zone in sales, but have not crossed over for better success or they just haven't had the chemistry that delivers for it with the work accomplished. For Keith Urban, he has had a lot of joy in his career with his success in country music. But overall, he has not had that widespread success cross over into the pop world, as was the case with Shania Twain or Faith Hill had delivered. Now, with a slew of good performances he has had, he now is trying to cross over with pop with his latest single, The Fighter from his album, Ripcord. the song, which features Carrie Underwood, works well for him as a solo track, but as a duet it misses the mark a bit. Carrie Underwood surprisingly underperforms on the song with having more of a voice into the pop anthem. While it sounds like a hit for Keith, and it is, there could've been a bit more chemistry into the track overall. It is a good download for die hard Keith Urban fans, but there could've been more from Carrie for a higher score.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"At forty-five, Redman (Reginald Noble) of Def Squad, Hit Squad and Red & Meth is much older than the new guard of hip-hop, but he doesn't sound like a wheezing, beleaguered old man at all. Some of his '90s-edge has escaped him, but for the most part, he still sounds like the same old Redman, except what relevance does he serve in today's growing and competitive rap landscape? His reputation would suggest that it's near impossible to picture the merry and mean emcee hopping on some erudite conscious tip, and that's exactly what he doesn't do on Mudface (Nov. 13), his eighth solo LP and his first album not on Def Jam Recordings. The followup to 2010's Reggie, Mudface is instead catered by Red's Gilla House Records, and it's obvious the Def Jam panache is missing. The hard truth is that though his veteran hall of fame status in the game is vaulted for good, he just isn't the hottest ticket in town anymore, and on top of that, on Mudface, he shows no new angles and just doesn't outdo himself.\n\nDespite its too many shortcomings, Mudface does house the fun, wild unmediated jollies Redman has always been known to get his rocks off with, but now, name-dropping celebrities, referencing pop culture, partying in the club, smoking his grade A stash, and belting out a few namesake catchword anthems is not going to make the cut. The Gilla House posse song \"Undeniable\" is nice, but it's unlikely the beginning of a super group. \"Bars\" contains some of the best lyrics on the album, but Redman should have gone that hard lyrically on the rest of the tracks. What remains is medium well wordplay in flawless moderato obsequious to Redman's well established formula.\n\nSadly, the production is also poorly innovative, a music relic of Red's heyday that bypassed the necessary sound upgrades, giving us a trip back in time that we don't necessarily need. This is clean content compared to the controversial hip-hop material of the present, making Red an option for today's kids that parents might let slide. Redman pokes fun at enough new phenomena and landmark events that came about since Reggie to give Mudface an intriguingly current timeliness, and he will no doubt attract a few new fans, but in short, the album is short (thirteen tracks clocking in at thirty-four minutes) with fading fortunes, no surprises and no brilliant answer to the question, 'So what?' in regards to the purpose and importance of the album. Let's just hope Blackout 3 and Muddy Waters 2 actually come out, save the man's reputation and give him more of the respect he so deserves.","classification":2,"fold":4}

{"text":"The ethereal sound was created by laboriously building up multiple overdubs of the voices of Stewart, Graham Gouldman, Godley and Creme singing a single note in unison. This multi-track was then mixed and dubbed down onto 16-track tape. This process was repeated across all 16 tracks to create a lush 256-voice \"virtual\" choir that could \"sing\" chromatic chords.[2] A number of these prepared multi-tracks were then cut into several endless loops, each of which contained the basic notes of the main chords used in the song. The chorus loops could then be played by using the mixing desk rather like a keyboardeach chord could be sounded by bringing up the fader for that loop. The instrumental break featured the repeated spoken phrase, \"Big boys don't cry...\", spoken by Kathy Warren, the receptionist of their own Strawberry Studios where the band recorded the track. These whispered lyrics would later serve as the inspiration for Brit  group, The Cure, who had an album and song called Boys Don't Cry. Axl Rose has also stated that this is one of his favorites which inspired him to get into music.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Forms of poetry are often logos of memes with positive flaws while songs have new kinds of sentences, considering my patience with time as though my eyes are actually the students for these ears under my hair.  Yes, and how many ears must one man have before he can hear people cry?  Dylans associations with mankind are fine because he stays loose and plays with syntax to get insight whether he uses plain English or not, so the intrinsic behaviors to his godly motives are fascinating if also miraculous of intellect as well as rarity.  Utter honesty is his best defense when visions are as light as air, contemplating here about the evolution of deaths even if my prosperity can never be considered the obvious return from my oral literacy or one special type of speech impediment.  Dylans accuracy of life portrayal isn't sketchy but quite a definitive reference to wisdom and proclamations which become ironic for possible answers thatd be too long.  The catch phrase Blowin in the Wind for me implies mystery of wisdom since torrents of weather really haunt peaceful armies before spelling out an unknown danger, being itself a collection of memes that form the real word in a society of slippery doves and washed mountains.  My favoritism of folk music is too my actualization of materialism with secondhand spirits during this sleepy discovery of rounds with musical notes, turning my exhausted body into a medium of reception in the causing sunshine near those musical videogame consoles.  Dylans courage is really his fear, very much in tune with his awkwardness of bravery at a moment here and there, performing with twisty physics; I can say more about this, and Dylans determination isn't usually his regret throughout song playing but promises in emotional terms.  His childish strength is his romantic reign of the songs pieces of advice relating to Earths likely devastations, so Dylans imbecility is cute yet truly serves as a warning symbol for doubt exaggeration.  Blowin in the Wind is a romantic chant because Dylan juggles ideas with infatuated meanings rather than observing an obvious thesis, and by getting to basic predictions he turns out to be a very unlikely hero.  Dylan can inscribe lyrics under purple light due to his abstractions with easygoing agony as well as vague demands, and he cuts a statement to the bone, living through reactions toward ordinary nature in his interesting admiration of defense.  Maybe rapid feedback from reviewers gets customers going, but I like to treat our reading as a chance for meditation instead of fashionable conversation attributed to busy people.  In fact, fashionable conversation attributed to busy people is a source of aliteracy.  By my phrase admiration of defense, Im describing what romance is in poetry.  Indeed, with answers blowing in the clouds around the bends of Dylans proclamations over historic references, I believe we need to be more confused about our learned behaviors since our knowledge of love may occasionally be a precipice to the darkness.  Yes, and how many times must a man look up before he can see the sky?  Blowin in the Wind refers to an answer; however, it may refer to a question in addition, so we can try to find statements in the air without having favorites that ruin vivid scenes or training aggravated nerves.  Its pretty neat to be called a friend after Ive realized my personal edification of sensation over mystery, so Dylans casual attraction to his notions is his gusto of his involved presence around quick-playing harmonicas as well as catchy tunes that play out the roles of a guardian over humanity, and its legal.","classification":5,"fold":4}

The girlfriend is really skilled in the bedroom, but she's otherwise crazy, he kept her around or keeps her around because she's wicked good and brings out his animal nature.  It's rude, it's demeaning, it's crazy in and of itself, but that's what I like about it.

{"text":"I think I'm giving up on Lucinda Williams.\n\nWith her first, I dunno, six albums, she pretty much hit it out of the park. With her next 2-3, she was ok and the disks grew on me. But with 2008's 'Little Honey' it kind of all went south for me. She somewhat - kind of - redeemed herself with her 2014 release, but a Williams album, to me, should be more than just halfway passable.\n\nI have zero qualms with the musicianship on 'the Ghosts of Highway 20'.  The musicians are great. For g-d's sake, she has Bill Frisell and Greg Leisz on guitars. Not too shabby.\n\nThe songwriting seems ok. Not Williams-stellar, but certainly not bad either.\n\nBut like the last few disks, it's Lucinda's voice, or lack thereof, that drags the songs down. The gravel, or singing with a mouthful of broken marbles makes Marianne Faithful (circa 1979) sound like sweetest voiced angel ever.\n\nAnd it's not that Williams should have the perfect voice - that's not her style, it never was - but if you compare, not even her early work, but the could have been \/ should have been great 'West' and the iffy 'Blessed' in comparison she could give diction lessons then.\n\nPerhaps she has a vocal cord issue. If so, she should get a vocal coach and do some exercises. If she's purposefully trying to sound like this, then the end-result is lost on me.\n\nI get her \"true fans\" would rip me apart for a review like this. But I own every disk she's ever released. Just because you like an artist doesn't mean they get a free pass for putting out subpar albums.\n\nThe bigger question is if I will just buy her next disk blindly.","classification":2,"fold":4}

However, this Laura (as represented in this song) will always be remembered by many lives she touched. And this song is so inspiring because I knew a person like the Laura in this song that made such a difference in my life and many lives yet was taken too soon.\nThis song is all about this:  It is not the time and years one spends on this earth, but what one does with the time and years that counts.

{"text":"This is a very good 2015 release from Richard Thompson, featuring 17 tracks of new material on 2 CDs. The music is up to Richard Thompson's usual high standard.\n\nCD 1 is 12 tracks with a playing time of just over 50 minutes; CD2 is 5 tracks with a playing time of about 25 minutes. The songs are typical Richard Thompson themes: broken relationships and off beat characters, along with a song about Richard Thompson's guitar heroes.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Richard Thompson, he has had a recording career dating back to the 1960s and he's one of the best guitarists on the music scene. This album is indicative of his talents and would be a good introduction for those unfamiliar with Richard Thompson's music.\n\nOne comment about the pricing of this 2CD Deluxe edition, though. The main difference between the 2CD Deluxe version and the basic single CD version is the 2nd CD, which contains 5 songs clocking in a about 25 minutes total playing time. As I'm writing this (July 2015) the price difference between the 2CD Deluxe set and the single CD release is only about one dollar. At that price, buy the 2CD Deluxe version; the second CD is well worth an extra dollar.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"\"Pitch Perfect\" has been one of the surprise movies for me this year. Totally charming and delightful from start to finish, with great a cappella singing throughout. It is hard to believe but Anna Kendrick has scored a Billboard Hot 100 top 10 hit with \"Cups (Pitch Perfect's \"When I'm Gone\")\", the expanded version of the original song, and when I say \"expanded\", I don't just mean in length (the song now is a little over 2 min.), as the song was also remixed and instrumentation was added.\n\n\"Cups (Movie Version\" (1'17\") is, on the other hand, the ORIGINAL song as we see it performed in the movie. That means several things: first, this is a short song, as it was intended all along. Second, this is Anna Kendrick singing a cappella, without any further instrumentation added, again as it was intended all along. I love this song, to be honest.\n\nWhether anyone buys this original version, or the remixed\/extended version is up to you of course. Simply be aware of the differences in the two versions, as it appears some people here have bought the original version thinking they are buying the song they have heard on the radio. Not the case. \"Cups (Movie Version)\" is the ORIGINAL but short and a cappella version. I personally happen to like the original version much better, but that's just me.

You can let go....\"  It talks about a little girl learning to ride her bike with her daddy holding on to the seat and she says, \"You can let go now, Daddy.\"  Then it takes the listener through the various stages of the girl's life and the instances where she told her daddy that he could let go, like when he walked her down the aisle at her wedding, and how she would be okay if he let go.  Then it goes on to his death where she tells him that he can go ahead and let go...very moving.  I'm crying as I'm typing.  It's that good.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Jaheim- Still Ghetto\nG H E T T O! What a word. We all know where the word is derived but what does it mean today? Jaheim seems to know exactly how to relate\"ghetto\" to everyday life. His first CD was great and this one picks up right from there. Jaheim captures the feeling of soul music. He is what NEO SOUL is supposed to be. I think the music we label as Neo Soul really isn't that. It's a new, fresh approach, reminiscent of the Langston Hughes age in Black America. Jaheim is the 70's revisited, not just in sound but in feelin. His lead single \"Fabulous\" is a great song. Some might tire of the kids participation in the song, but the real strength is the message. It highlights the up's and downs of \"ghetto life\" and how this community accepts it, shakes it off and keeps going. In listening to this song you are aware that it's really not talkin about white America but about our own community. For some reason we've developed a split in the black community, where affluent blacks look down on the \"ghetto\" life. As Ja put's it \"We've got love for yall but yall don't love us\". Good song. It's not being taken as seriously as it should. Jaheim really is a classic balladeer though, making true love music. Music we grew up too. that's where this CD shines. Track 5, \"Put That Woman First\" is reminiscent of Rrah's \"A Woman's Threat\" and uses the same sample that Ludacris used on \"Growing Pains\" from his Word Of Mouf CD. Great song. MJB makes and appearance on \"Beauty and The Thug\". Great song  and this duet was destiny from the moment Ja came on the same. they both embody the soul of the \"ghetto\". My favorite song on this CD has to be track 7 \"Me and My B*tch\". Now before you say anything I know that title might be offensive to some but MANNNNNNNNNN! Dude pulls this off! He makes this work. It has a smooth OJAY's ring to it. Great song. My favorite songs on this CD are 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,13,14...This CD works because Jaheim reminds us the beauty in the ghetto, the love and the life. Too many of us have forgot that the ghetto is more than just gunshots and teen pregnancy.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"This collection from 1981 has nearly gone unnoticed, probably due to the lack of input from Bernie Taupin.  It is filled with great uptempo, complex arrangments like, \"Breaking Down Barriers\" and\"Fascist Faces\".  \"Just Like Belgium\" is one of Elton's most upbeat romantic songs since the mid-seventies and \"Carla\/Etude\/Fanfare\" (which runs into) \"Chloe\" is a testament to Elton John's creativity.  However, the best song on the album and the only single, \"Nobody Wins\" beats out the rest for arrangment, lyrics and heartfelt tearjerking.  Amazingly, this single is omitted from all collections.

{"text":"Twenty88 is a collaboration project that I've never expected, and honestly it is a project I never wanted but after listening to this album a couple of times, I am thoroughly convinced this album is good, maybe even really good. Big Sean and Jhene Aiko as solo acts can be a hit or miss for me. Big Sean's ability as an MC have always been underwhelming to say the least and Jhene Aiko's vocal range have been always limited. But I must say, there is an amazing synergy between these 2 that I rarely seen between other duo acts. Big Sean and Jhene Aiko's chemistry on this album is an undeniable and I would be lying if I said they don't sound great together. The real star on this project however is the production. The sounds on this album can range from slow experimental one minute to soulful the next; needless to say the music itself deserves some much needed praise. There is a nice balance of new and old that R&B fans and alternative hip hop fans can appreciate.\n\nAll praises aside, this album has many flaws with the first have to be the songwriting. This album is an R&B album if anything else with the two of them exploring the different sides of love. It's sexual, intimate and passionate which is great, however I cannot stand some of the incredibly cliche lines that are on this album. These songs are very straightforward with little to no room for subtly which can be a problem at times. The second complaint I have is with Big Sean. Big Sean is known to be corny at times and very monotone which is still present on this album, but I can't help but feel that Big Sean was trying his absolute hardest to do his best Drake impression. There were far too many times where Big Sean sounded identical to Drake and I have to knock off points for that. Other than that, if I don't get another Twenty88 problem that would be fine with me. This album accomplishes what it needed to and it sounds great; I don't see a need for another one.\n\nFavorite 5\n1) Deja Vu\n2) Talk Show\n3) London Bridge\n4) 2 Minute Warning feat. Detail and K-Ci & Jojo\n5) Memories Faded","classification":4,"fold":4}

I had no idea who Brett Dennen was before today. I've spent much of today looking for new music on Amazon just to check out. This album wowed me with it's simplicity and just put me in a great mood. It immediately earned a place on my phone as a full download.\n\nThe lyrics aren't always positive but the music behind them just improved my outlook on the day. It just flows through me in a totally hard to describe way.\n\nIt's got a very unique sound that I don't know what I'd compare it with. It's just hard to describe what this sounds like. It's kind of combining multiple genres into something new, without being exactly like any of the inspirational sounds.\n\nIt's perfect for chilling out to on a Saturday afternoon and just letting the music flow through you. It's simple vocals with a hypnotic band doing it's thing in the background. It just makes me want to go outside and enjoy life.\n\nCassidy is a great song that is just a full meal for my ears. I absolutely loved this track. It's one of my favorites. It's one of those songs that just forces me to move around and enjoy the music.\n\nWhere We Left off is another track that really wowed me.

Although sum 41 has shifted their style since the release of \"all killer\", this band never fails to amaze, and getting any album from them is worth your while.\n\nUpside: \"Fat Lip\" is perhaps one of the catchiest and most original pop-punk songs I've ever heard.\n\nDownside: The album is a little short, and fails to live up to it's name with the :49 second filler song \"wake up\".\n\nYou'll like \"SUM 41\" if you like: Blink 182 and Green Day.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I want to begin by saying that while I understand that not everyone will enjoy this cd for various reasons, I believe a lot of the negativity is simply knee jerk reactions to the drastic change. I believe given time this cd will grow on some of the detractors. Some of the greatest music I've ever listened to was not enjoyed the first few listens. Sometimes it takes time to really absorb it and appreciate what the artist(s) were trying to accomplish.\n\nThat said, I don't feel just because a band uses similar instrumentation and takes on a similar sound as other bands makes them a poor band or their album a poor effort. There are thousands upon thousands of bands that sound similar and use similar instrumentation across many genres. I think it's an unfair assessment and strike against Mumford and Sons, when there are so many others guilty of the same offense yet still loved by millions. To me it's just a reason to dislike a band because they aren't what you want them to be, which is just unfair to the artist(s). Something most \"fans\" should understand is musicians write music to express themselves and its not written to please you. It's written to please them and is their form of expression. There is an extreme amount of self centered behavior amongst music fans that I don't like.\n\nAs for the cd itself, I enjoy it and welcome the change. I feel that they weren't gonna top Sigh No More with their previous style and didn't really enjoy the over the top vocals for any extended amount of time. This cd has a good flow to it and places the upbeat songs in the right places so it's not slow for too long. I'm a bigger fan of the more upbeat songs, but none of the songs are bad really.","classification":4,"fold":4}

Then I listened to \"Good News For People Who Love Bad News\". I had known the hit song \"Float On\" but never really looked into the band before. Many consider it one of their better albums, but I personally only liked half of the songs. I then worked my way backward through the bands discography. Their landmark album \"The Lonesome Crowded West\" was my second favorite. I'm sure many hardcore fans will strongly disagree and say it's the greatest thing from the band, but that's just my personal opinion. So after initially discovering the bands music, they seemed to stop making music. I would eagerly wait for the bands next move for 3 years, which is how long most albums are released apart from each other. I eventually virtually gave up on any new material from the band around 2012 as many other bands and artists were releasing great albums from different genres. Then suddenly near the end of 2014 their was news of a new single \"Lampshades on Fire\". All of my hope was instantly reignited as I heard the thumping pop rocker of a track knowing a new album would follow shortly after. The song proved to be another hit and I'm glad the band has showed they can still be relevant in the constantly changing music scene. In the months leading up to the album they released 4 more swell songs which only made my anticipation even greater. I waited 8 years for this album, and I am not one bit disappointed with the outcome. Here is a track by track review.\n\n1. Strangers To Ourselves: This is such a relaxing introduction song. The violins throughout are heavenly. The vocals are just gorgeous along with the faint guitars throughout. Just beautiful. 10\/10\n2. Lampshades On Fire: I'm sure if you're new to the band this is the reason you're here. This was a worthy lead single that almost explores all of the sounds the band has experimented with in their career. It's a rock song good for parties with lyrics that mean so much more. Brock showcases his distinct lispy ranty vocals with sprinkles of his more elegant singing in such great fashion. Just great. 9.5\/10\n3. Sh*t In Your Cut: Nice title right? This song starts out slowish with plucking drums before the guitars steal the show. The vocals are more of the mix between Brocks chanting and singing. The song ends with great group vocals that the band does best. 9.5\/10\n4. Pistol: This song seems to be getting hate from many. Many have gone as far as to call it one of the bands worst. I can understand why many dislike it. The vocal effect used in the song can sound annoying at first. The style of the song is very different for the band sounding like a rip off of 80s Depeche Mode. I however got over it and actually think the song is fun and gets better with repetition. Not their best, but not horrible at all. 8\/10\n5. Ansel: Back to typical MM. This is a glowing track with colorful melodies and a nice guitar riff. The song sounds almost tropical in a way but has dark lyrics. Its a short song but it such a profound lasting effect to it. 9\/10\n6. The Ground Walks, With Time In A Box: Another interesting title. This is another of the songs released leading up to the album. The band takes a stylistic detour into disco rock. I thought it sounded similar to the style Arcade Fire explored in Reflektor. The song is full of funky and spacious guitars and horns and twists and turns. Around the 2 minute mark the chorus hits with what can be described as entrancing and very original. I wish it was repeated more than twice though. A friend of mine called this one of the best songs he's ever heard, and that's coming from a guy who wasn't familiar with the band. At 6 minutes this song flies by with style. 10\/10\n7. Coyotes: Another slower song. It was released shortly after 'Lampshades' with a very adorable video of a coyote. The soft guitar riff is nice but the chorus is just elegantly delivered. It almost brings about tears with its beauty. I'll compare this to the previous albums 'Little Motel' but this is honestly better. Just a beautiful dreamy song all around. One of the best from the band. 10\/10\n8. Pups To Dust: This song returns to the sound of earlier MM with its relaxing westernized guitars. It really sounds like a lost track from 'Lonesome Crowded West'.  It's another anthem for the band with lyrics that mean so much. The mood of this song is melancholy but not in a bad way. It's another dreamy song. 9\/10\n9. Sugar Boats: This song returns to the nautical style of their last album with some carnival sounds as well but without Johnny Marr(Sadly). The guitars are nice and rocking still and interesting horns are prominent throughout. Its a fun song from beginning to end. 9\/10\n10. Wicked Campaign: This song almost dives into heartland rock territory but maintains the indie sound. It's a very catchy song of course. The chorus has that U2 stadium appeal. It's a song that leaves me with a feeling of being inspired. 9\/10\n11. Be Brave: The song title says it all. The vocals are more of the chanting with the quiet laid back singing sliding in now and again. Reminds me of their song \"Florida\" just a bit. 8.5\/10\n12. God Is An Indian And You're An A**hole: One of the longer more interesting titles, but the shortest song. The title might offend some, but the song is executed nicely. Not one of my favorites though. I'm sure many others will like it more. 7.8\/10\n13. The Tortoise And The Tourist: The trademark guitar style of early MM is back on here again. Its another rocker with a haunting tone. It manages to be a bit harsh and melodic at the same time. The chorus is strangely addicting in a way that pumps you up. 8.5\/10\n14. The Best Room: One of my all time favorites. I've replayed it more than 100 times before the albums released and never grow tired of it. For a time it became my gym soundtrack. The lyrics are reportedly about a UFO experience that led to a certain tacky hotel. The guitars are great and instant classic riffs. The vocals switch between chanting and singing perfectly. It's a beautiful rocking song. The bridge section with intertwined vocals is infectious. I would compare this to \"Steam Engenius\" but catchier. One of the bands best. 10\/10\n15. Of Course We Know: This is a dark toned closer for the album. Very apocalyptic in a way. I compared the style to Sigur Ros but with vocals from Brock. The guitar style on this one is very Post Rock. When I first heard it I didn't think it was amazing. But now I think its the perfect ending. The background vocals compliment the lead singing in a strangely touching way. It's a powerful outro song. 9\/10\n\nSo this album was a nice reminder of how great this band is. This is a musical journey as cliche as that sounds. It manages to be strange yet appealing at the same time throughout. You will need to be able to devote your full attention to fully enjoy all of the intricate aspects of the songs. I know I will continue to find new things in each song. I might even find a new favorite in a song that I previously didn't think was the best. It's a great soundtrack for driving or just background music at home depending on your mood. Some have said the album seems too long. I think the longer the better honestly. More music to digest! I won't say this is my favorite album from the band fully, but I can say for now it's a tie with this and \"We Were Dead\". If you're already a MM fan you'll either love this or at least somewhat like it. If you're new to the band and you liked 'Lampshades' you'll love the album. If you like good new music then give this a listen and see if you like it. 8 years and not only is this album worth it, but the band says a follow up album is on its way. Hopefully as great as this album if not better!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"What a coincidence that I was talking to a friend at the local record store just the other day about about how,in the last several years music in general seemed to be improving and gaining more depth. While we were referring specifically to more instrumental jazz,rock and soul the same is definitely starting to come true for pop music as well. Interesting though. Popular music,after all,ends up being something like chewing gum: it's strong at first but loses it's flavor slowly with time. That's especially true in an environment when popular music usually means overdressed female performers aggressively over-singing songs assisted mostly by auto-tune and other needlessly loud electronics,usually played and\/or programmed in a rather juvenile fashion. Tegan And Sara have apparently been quite successful on the indie pop scene for a number of years now. Though I never heard there music outside a passing reference from time to time. But when I heard they were making a pop oriented record with Pink's producer Greg Kurstin,I wondered what was going to come of that so decided to pick this up.\n\n  The album opens with \"Closer\"-with it's punchy synthesizer's and danceable rhythmic sound the impression is something in the neighborhood of Madonna meets Belinda Carlisle. \"Drove Me Wild\",talking an even more uptempo look at things is a similarly well arranged dance-rocker as well. \"Goodbye Goodbye\",\"I Was A Fool\" and \"Love They Say\" take on a rather more nuanced musical approach-the former two very much more in the school of 3-chord indie guitar pop with some wonderfully recorded vocal harmonies and the latter with a mixture of atmospheric keyboards and a more rhythmic guitar attack. \"I'm Not Your Hero\" and \"How Come You Don't Want Me\" both build from a gentle and nuanced opening back into that dance\/rock frenzy again. \"On \"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\" that \"big sound\" Kurstin is so famous for getting (especially in the case of Pink) is prominent  in the rocked up dance arrangement. The album ends with the slower,almost trance dance styled \"Now I'm All Messed Up\" and the rhythmically slower,and somewhat funkier \"Shock To Your System\".\n\n  Working symbiotically with Kurstin Tegan and Sara accomplish something here that is a rare feat for modern pop artists looking to the music of the 1980's as a source for musical inspiration. Their entire approach to that form comes entirely from the concept that the pop music sound of the 80's was very much a production and compositional extension of classic 60's and 70's instrumentation and songwriting. The synthesizers and electronic instruments used in the arrangements of this album are completely melodic and flow ideally from the beginning of the song to the next. They never come off as purely gimmicky EDM-type pop at all. Not only that but Tegan and Sara both rely on their expressive,soaring singing style,two part and multi tracked vocal harmonies rather than any electronic device to make their voice sound inevitably more robotic. Along with the albeit more soul\/jazz\/funk oriented sound of newcomer Jessie Ware,the music of Tegan and Sara on this album represents a very welcomed return to live,organic yet studio-centric pop music.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Listening to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" the starter to Nirvana's 'Nevermind' will always remind one why the album is such an alternative classic.  Definitive for the fast-forward thrust of their guitars and the primal scream trajectory of Kurt Cobain's blistering vocals, they literally invented alternative as we know it.  Nevertheless, even the most creative endeavors have their influences, and ingredients are mixed and matched for the newest alchemy.  While one can cite John Lennon's 'Plastic Ono Band' as a vocal first and The Replacements as  influences, their blend here is new and masterful.  While \"grunge\" may be more of a fashion statement than a sound bite for the C.D., \"garage band\" is a more apt description of what they perfected for all.  With a mix of punk and heavy metal, they jump start a whole new genre.\n\nBesides the absolutely sublime primal angst of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" there's the propulsive \"Breed,\" and the iconoclastic \"Territorial Pissings\".  With a mocking intro that starts falsely with \"Get Together,\" the latter song does more than separate the generations musically and lyrically.  Then, there's the expert texture of more mid-tempo gems like \"Lithium,\" the beautifully acoustical \"Polly,\" and the throbbing and multi-layered \"Drain You\".  \"Lounge Act\" keeps the energy going and drummer, David Grohl, whose gruelling efforts are remarkable all the way, really delivers on \"Stay Away\".  The vocal tradeoff between Cobain and bassist, Chris Novoselic proves that you can do alternative and have great voices--that is tuneful and with great trajectory.  If the variations of expert guitar patterns don't disappoint, then the variety certainly scotches any complaints of formula.  \"Something in the Way,\" which closes the album, forecasts a more \"unplugged\" future, even though the expertise of guitar work hardly needs elaboration.\n\nAfter 'Nevermind' has played endlessly on the radio, it is easy to take their work for granted.  I, for one, didn't even realize that all these songs were Nirvana's.  Which goes to prove that their innovations would make music new again, and it would take some people a while to catch up--not just musicians, but even some listeners.","classification":5,"fold":4}

Tunes I thought were good were \"Zorro's Ascent\" (it's got a great beat to it), the radio friendly \"I Like Girls\" (with guest vocalist The Waitress's Patty Donahue - R.I.P.), \"Tag,You're It\" and \"I'm Alive (That Was The Day My Dead Pet Returned to Save My Life)\". There's a cut here \"I Am The Future\" that at first I didn't remember where I've heard it before. Turns out it was part of the movie soundtrack for 'Class Of '84'.

{"text":"With their unique blend of catchy pop melodies and rock band sensibilities, Lifehouse has held my attention since pretty much the beginning. (Although I must confess their last album, Almeria, somehow flew under my radar completely.) While their latest release, Out of the Wasteland, doesnt break any new ground, I don't think it necessarily strives to, either. Rather, it once again serves to highlight everything we love about them in the first place, and I hope when I describe the CD as typical Lifehouse that doesnt come off as a negative thing.\n\nThe album starts off strong with the upbeat Hurricane, and continues with One For the Pain, which contains some clever lyrics and wordplay and has already solidified itself as one of my top ten Lifehouse songs of all time. If Im being honest I think the record drags a little in the middle; theres nothing actively terrible here by any means but tracks 5 through 9 are all mid-tempo, guitar-driven songs that kind of blend together if listened to all in a row and none really stick out as strong, immediately identifiable songs on their own. But thats just my opinion. DO keep paying attention, however, because Jason hands the lead vocals over to Bryce on Stardust and his interpretations are always interesting to hear. The album closes with a fantastic low-key trilogy of songs which finds Jason and the guys in a poignant mood and baring their souls more than ever. In fact, while many would probably say Hurt This Way is directed toward an ex-lover, I might go as far as to interpret it as Jasons letter to his younger self. Either way, its another favorite.\n\nAll in all, its a solid album. True, it has its share of filler  then what album doesnt?  but when it hits it hits hard, and the songwriting is definitely more mature and introspective than ever before without compromising the mainstream appeal. Musically it may not have taken many risks (Smoke and Mirrors was full of surprises, in a good way) but as I said before, they have a certain formula that works for them. Its probably a bit premature to rank this album definitively, but suffice it to say that if you like ANY of their previous records you will probably enjoy this one as well.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Honestly, I like 50 Cent as a rapper; he has a certain honesty to him that is lacking in most rappers today. When I heard that he was signing with Dr. Dre and Eminem, I was happy for him; it was certainly the best career choice he ever made, since this has sold 4 million plus albums. But one provision though, the only reason he is in mainstream culture is beause he is associated with Eminem, which will guarantee platinum status(think D12). As far as the music goes' it gets stale and repetetive after awhile. Wanksta is a great song; not for the lyrics, but for his approach towards the fakes and phonies of the rap world. But I love 50 anyway, and God bless him in future projects.","classification":2,"fold":4}

{"text":"The reverse chronological order is interesting but I just didn't care much for the newer material.  That is however not the reason for subtracting a star.  It is for three reasons.  The vinyl has a major manufacturing problem and should be recalled.  There are skips and ticks right out of the shrinkwrap.  They looked mint but they were mint by no means.  There is also a glaring omission and a mastering glitch at the same time.  The end of \"Ziggy Stardust\" literally chops off abruptly where it would normally fade into the next song, \"Suffragette City\" which is nowhere to be found on this collection.  Whether intentional or not, it sounds terrible.  There's a split second of silence followed by \"Starman\".  At least the older greatest hits compilations faded out the ending.  Worth noting:  The remix of \"Young Americans\" is badass.  The background singers are separated properly throughout the stereo spectrum.  It sounds like they're right there in your home.  The cymbals sound crisp, the saxophone sounds amazing and the piano is turned up in the mix as well.  They had the right intentions with this collection but the execution is just too far from spot-on that I can't give it 5 stars.  If you must have it, stick to the CD version.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"History Of Modern is the long awaited return for OMD, their first album released in the US in fifteen years. A band that for the most part thought lost in the 80's since the acclaimed \"Crush\" and \"The Pacific Age\", they had a few album released in the 90's that tried to fit the sounds of the time but were for the most part ignored. Mounting a comeback in the 21st century would seem a daunting challenge but one OMD picks up none the less. History Of Modern harkens back to the well produced and thought out albums like Crush. The go back to their signature sounds of electronic strings and chorus-like vocals. Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys high tenor voices sound just as good as back then. They go back to topics they've covered before. Religious themes like Sister Marie Says (available for free at the OMD website) sounds like an updated version of Anola Gay. The refrain of \"New Babies: New Toys (\"It's better for the girls but it's bigger for the boys\") has all sorts of possible imagery. \"History Of Modern part I\" is a techno-dance track with a philosophy of nothing today really matters as the moments move away. Many other tracks song of love and loss. Probably the most catchy song is \"Pulse\" which has a very strong to the classic Laidbach dance track, \"White Horse\". This is unquestionably one of their best efforts. Not a perfect album by any means especially \"Sometimes\" with the constant refrain of \"Sometimes I feel like a motherless child\". But OMD has successfully managed to bridge the decades together to put together a winning and provoking album.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Clocking in at almost 90 minutes, Lucinda Williams delivers much too much material on this outing that is not first rate, material that should have been saved and reworked for something in the future ... or left on the cutting room floor.\n\nAll of that being said, the songs that Ive managed to live with are brilliant, often sounding lo-fi, etherial and dreamy, out of time and out of touch ... like searching the radio dial on a road trip, picking up a distant weak station signal that strains your ears to be heard, and then as you crest the mountain or come out of a tunnel, its gone.  Leaving you to consider going back, just to hear a bit more of the magic that sent midnight shivers running through your bones on the open road.\n\nLucinda is one of the few people who are writing songs from the heart anymore, writing solid songs of her personal emotional experiences, writing songs that linger, writing songs from a troubled life that ride comfortably in your back pocket, because who among us has not had those moments of weakness, and needs music like this to let us know that were not out here on our own, lost on the vastness of a deserted highway.\n\nMind you, there are those of you who will love the songs Ive chosen not to play, and thats the best part about listening to Lucinda Williams, she has so much to offer to so many people.  So pick what you like, or take it all ... me [?], Im keeping:\n\nDust, Death Came, Doors Of Heaven, Ghosts Of Highway 20, Bitter Memory, If My Love Could Kill, Faith & Grace ... variations of the others Ive heard before.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","classification":3,"fold":4}

Thank Rick Rubin and the extraordinary band they assembled, including my personal favorite, Mike Campbell of The Heartbreakers. But most of all thank Johnny Cash for devoting his final years to his music.\n\nHis voice is noticeably frailer even than on American V, as he was truly at the end of his life on these final recordings. It diminishes his power not one bit, however, as he sings with the same passion and honesty he always did. The song selection is impeccable once again, and the musical accompaniment is once again sparse, always putting Cash's voice in the forefront.\n\nIt's not an innovative album, and it's not meant to be (though it's interesting and impressive the way the music in the final song subtly works in a bit of \"how great thou art\").

{"text":"Six years after their last album of original material, Counting Crows are back. Somewhere Under Wonderland is a solid comeback for the band, even if it feels slightly disconnected at the seams.\n\nPalisades Park is an ambitious opener, complete with a jazzy intro and shifting dynamics. The band still has the ability to take an eight minute song and make it feel completely effortless. Frontman Adam Duritz can still weave an engrossing story as tracks like John Appleseed's Lament and the rock-flavored Dislocation clearly demonstrate. The aggressive tones of Dislocation and Elvis Went to Hollywood recall some of the band's earlier work on records like Recovering the Satellites, yet it's the folk-driven narratives of God of Ocean Tides, Scarecrow and Cover Up the Sun that really steal the show. Most of these tracks recall stories of traveling and life on the road, giving the record an undercurrent of dislocation and late nights spent between cities It's an interesting concept and Duritz pulls it off wonderfully, complete with the beautiful closer Possibility Days.\n\nWhile the songs are mostly solid, I can't help feeling that they lack some cohesion. The record features a nice blend of styles but the country tracks are so good that I almost wish the band had just stripped down and gone for a full-blown folk album. The individual songs are quite good but there's also nothing quite as poignant as Amy Hit the Atmosphere or Rain King. Adam's voice and lyrics are as strong as ever but at only nine tracks the album feels a bit too brief; another two or three songs would have rounded it out nicely. These are minor points that are easy to overlook when the strength of the songs themselves is kept in focus.\n\nIn spite of that, Somewhere Under Wonderland is a refreshing return for one of my favorite bands. Despite a couple of hiccups this is a fun release that gets better with every spin and gives me hope that Duritz and his bandmates will continue to weave more tales for quite some time.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"I remember Radiohead emerging with \"Creep\" at the height of the grunge music movement 1991-1995 in 1993. I didn't think anything of the song, or of the band. But, in 1995, things shifted for me. Grunge had slowly been making its way into my music collection, and I was more open to its sounds. When Radiohead released \"The Bends\" with the singles \"High and Dry\" and \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\", I began to re-evaluate the band. Their videos had begun to catch my attention as well. I gave \"The Bends\" a good, solid listening to, and in the end I had to admit that the band was showing musical promise which would later be confirmed on their next album, 1997's \"OK Computer\".\n\nSo, basically, for all intents and purposes, you could argue that I have been a fan of Radiohead's music since 1995. I own all of their albums, but I've never seen them in concert. I'm by no means an uber-fan, just someone who appreciates what they have done over the past 23 years.\n\n\"A Moon Shaped Pool\" is solid. Good in every way. I don't think it's a classic by any measure, but the band is continuing to show experimentation and originality in their approach to music making, and that's what any fan wants. Let's not go stagnant, right?\n\nI, of course, have my favorites here like \"Burn the Witch\" with its Psycho-like strings, \"Daydreaming\" with its, well, daydream-like vibe, \"Ful Stop\" with its electronica, \"Identikit\", again with it's electronica, \"The Numbers\", \"Present Tense\", \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor Rich Man Poor Man Beggar Man Thief\" and the very melancholy and moving closing track \"True Love Waits\".\n\nI don't think Radiohead has made a weak album. They take their time between albums, ensuring things are not rushed. At the same time, they don't hit the pitfall of Peter Gabriel which is to stew on an album, tinkering, until perfection, thus running the risk of a stale album (see Peter Gabriel's 2002 \"Up\").\n\nThe band continue to surprise and inspire with \"A Moon Shaped Pool\", continuing to do things their way, at their pace, without much record label interference. This is the way music should be done, at the artist's behest. I have slick produced, manufactured music in my collection, and it's never as interesting as what an independent artist like Radiohead does.\n\nHere's how \"A Moon Shaped Pool\" compares with Radiohead's previous works:\n\n1993 Pablo Honey: Three and a Half Stars\n1995 The Bends: Four and a Half Stars\n1997 OK Computer: Five Stars\n2000 Kid A: Five Stars\n2001 Amnesiac: Four Stars\n2003 Hail To The Thief: Four Stars\n2006 (Thom Yorke) The Eraser: Three and a Half Stars\n2007 In Rainbows: Four Stars\n2011 The King Of Limbs: Four Stars\n2016 A Moon Shaped Pool: Four Stars","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Katy Perry gradually went from an artist I thought would just come and go to being near and dear to my heart. What got me hooked was actually her first album (when I gave in and gave it a couple of spins). \"Wide Awake\" is a ballad about the falling out from a relationship, the highs and the innocent view you have on it from the start before going through certain aspects that make you \"wake up\" so to speak. If you watched the video you would know that the song itself has a bit of a dark vibe to it which I think is only the pre-cursor for her next album in which Katy will \"get dark on\" according to her (and I can't wait!!).\n\nUltimately, this is one of those songs that is catchy because of the \"I'm wide awake\" hook but still has some depth to it.

{"text":"Imagine Dragons' debut album \"Night Visions\" is loaded with hooky songs, two of which have already been hit singles and\/or commercial jingles. \"Radioactive\" is the most inescapable of the batch, it's also the lead track on the CD. I hate to say this, but whenever I see that happening, a red flag goes up. \"It's Time\" is the song used for an Apple commercial, it's from an earlier EP and makes it to the debut on sheer momentum. Lead singer and primary emoticon Dan Reynolds heaps on the drama; you can tell these guys want to make it in the big time.\n\nBut. There's always a but. Why the ridiculous amount of built in distortion? The drums on \"Radioactive\" sound like the band put rubber pads on a mud slab and aimed for the biggest splat they could catch in the studio. When you've got a song as obviously catchy as this, why not play the song with real production instead of this amateurishly lo-fi bleating? If you think you're making a statement, you're not. It shows a certain lack of depth. When the band does match the songs to production that doesn't flatten the sound down to a pancake, you can hear the genuine ambition, like on \"Nothing Left To Say\" and the gentle, nearly folkish \"On Top Of The World\" (which reminded me of The Lumineers, of all bands).\n\nImagine Dragons could be the next big arena rock band. They've got the songs and the attitude that keeps \"Night Visions\" and it's gawdawful production from being a complete dumpster diver. I hope they can figure out how to use a studio by the time they get to the sophomore album.","classification":3,"fold":4}

Liked her in various movies, that's about it.\n\nBrowsing through iTunes, I came across her in the movie CHICAGO. A musical? Her? So I listened to a couple of songs and was amazed.  When I downloaded this song I was totally blown away.

{"text":"Although aware of Cher as an actress and someone who'd sung with her then-husband Sonny Bono, it wasn't until I was alerted to a new song by Cher.  Upon hearing it, I discovered she'd covered a Laura Branigan song I'd so adored on her Hold Me album.  The song was of course \"I Found Someone,\" which consisted of Michael Bolton's synth-oriented production, the same way he'd do Jennifer Rush on Passion.  Cher's eponymous 1987 album was a vehicle to her second comeback following a string of movie successes, and is a snapshot of the slick synth\/pop music of the 80's, when hard rock and pop consisted of layered synths and power ballads, the genre Bon Jovi succumbed to in Slippery When Wet.\n\nAs a diehard Branigan fan, I prefer the original, but there is a place for this remake, given the wall of synths production, and Toto's Steve Lukather giving help on guitar and on a solo.  Cher's version scratched the Top Ten compared to Branigan's #90.\n\nJon Bon Jovi and his bandmates give Cher lots of help here, whether it be on instruments or backing vocals, or songwriting.  \"We All Sleep Alone,\" the #14 single, was co-written and featured backing vocals by Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and rock producer Desmond Child.  Another backing vocalist here is legendary songwriter Holly Knight, late of Spider and Device.  There is that sage acceptance that sooner or later, we all sleep alone.  The same team contribute on a souped up version of \"Bang Bang,\" which she had done in the 60's with Sonny.  There is an operatic quality to the backing vocals, which is then given a harder-edged sound thanks to Richie Sambora, and a wall of synth sound by Holly Knight and Chuck Kentis.  I heard this version before the original, and in a rare move, find this to be my version.\n\nDesmond Child wrote and sang backups on the ballad \"Main Man,\" something Cher has had difficulty hanging onto ironically enough.  No, really, this is actually a great power ballad.  He and Diane Warren also co-wrote \"Give Our Love A Fighting Chance\" and \"Perfection,\" the first a power song that could fit on a Bon Jovi album, Slippery When Wet-era of course.  On the second song, Bonnie Tyler and Darlene Love sing the first two lines and are the featured vocalists joining Cher.  The song's theme of being at perfection at work AND at love reflects Cher's choice in singing it, given her marital track record with Sonny and later Gregg Allman.\n\n\"Skin Deep,\" though an upbeat number, managed a #79 showing on the charts.  The Desmond Child-Michael Bolton written \"Working Girl\" is a commentary on the hard work and harassment office women get.  The last track the Bolton-produced and co-written \"Hard Enough Getting Over You\" lists the painful reasons why one is reluctant to allow someone back into their life, be it the hurt from lies and the fear of latent pain becoming manifest.  One of the better non-singles here.\n\nCher's comeback is also a testimony to the 80's synth-oriented music produced by Desmond Child and Michael Bolton-okay, I'll give Bolton credit for his songwriting and production, but not his singing!  Cher would further her comeback on her next album, but alas, how some short some comebacks last.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Nobody gets on the radio without the backing of a major label who spend on average $300,000 per song per \"artist\".  ALL music heard on commercial radio has been extensively market researched using focus groups.  So the music you hear on radio is deliberately chosen, if not designed, to appeal to the most people in the demographic that is being marketed to.  Because so much money is at stake both in terms of profit and promotion, major record companies are interested not in music, but in moving product.  Art and integrity don't matter, only sales.  That is why we have bland, musical junkfood like Nickleback's The Long Road clogging up the airwaves.  And it's only going to get worse as more and more radio stations or marketing outlets are owned by fewer and fewer corporations.  Art by committee sucks folks.  As a marketing device Nickleback are brilliant, as music they stink on ice.  This is about as mindlessly commercial as it gets.","classification":1,"fold":4}

There is nothing wrong with love songs but i expected more than that from her. Her praises for a man gets a little tired. Overall, this is a pleasant CD to listen to.

Now Q-Tip has kept up quality work, but don't expect this to be a replica of any Tribe albums. Q-Tip's music has a slick vibe that one can just nod and relax to. The beats on here are dope as well.\n\nStandout tracks are not hard to find, if one doesn't get lost in the vibe. \"We Fight, We Love\" with Raphael Saadiq is a nice standout. \"Official\" is a track that vibes nicely and will make your head nod up and down softly. Further down the album is \"Life Is Better\" with singer Norah Jones that I enjoyed truly. \"Believe\" is great with the help of (AWOL) singer D'Angelo. the final track \"Shaka\" is a dedication to his brother Shaka, J-Dilla, and his father. An introspective track that I've had to hit the repeat button a few times.\n\nWe finally get an album from Q-Tip. The whole album vibes great, and Q-Tip seems like he hasn't missed a step despite some setbacks. I'm glad that he hasn't given up and was very persistent during situations like this. For some this will be a breath of fresh air with whats playing nowadays. I highly recommend this album.

{"text":"About a year ago, I bought three albums --the latest album by the Blind Boys of Alabama (wonderful), R. L. Burnside's A Troubled Mind (one of the two best I bought from Fat Possum records --the other was Robert Balfour), and this album.  In other words, I bought three outstanding albums, all at the same time.\n\nSo which one do I listen to most often? The Three Pickers.\n\nI've been a fan of Earl Scruggs for a long time. His albums with Lester Flatt are incomparable. They're the only blue grass albums that compare to jazz in my opinion, like listening to early Louis Armstrong.\n\nI like Ricky Skraggs, mostly for his background work on the Evangeline album, by Emmy Lou Harris. (I don't greatly like the one album I bought by Ricky with his own group.)\n\nI know that Doc Watson is a giant and I love his voice and manner but I've never spent time listening to him, principally because C&W and folk aren't my first thing. I've spent fifty-five years listening to jazz first and classical music second. It's not that easy changing gears.\n\nI bought this album first because Earl Scruggs was on it, second because Ricky and Doc are premiere players, and lastly because it looked pure and unadulterated, just world class performers playing together for fun.\n\nThat's what it is. All three pickers are in good form. They are having fun. It's clear they like being together. All of the songs they play are good, some wondrous.\n\nI like the cuts with Ricky Scraggs' group least, those with the three of the pickers and with Doc and his son most. Doc Watson has a beautiful tenor-baritone voice; he plays fine guitar both in background and solo. Earl Scruggs still plays with the fire and passion he had thirty-five years ago. What technical control he has! Ricky Scraggs is a first rate instrumentalist and very good in ensemble singing, but less successful as a solo vocalist. I wish I liked Ricky's group better --it's good but the cuts with the other groups are better. Alison Krause is on some cuts but doesn't have much to do.\n\nI usually don't like chatter on a music record but here it fits. The love --for the music they are playing and among the three men themselves -- is transparent.  It adds a warm glow to an exceptional record.\n\nDave Keymer\nModsesto CA","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor, infamous for long delays between albums, sure has been productive lately. 2007 saw Reznor release the critically acclaimed \"Year Zero\" and its' follow-up \"Year Zero Remixed.\" In addition, last year Reznor produced Saul Williams' \"The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of Niggy Tardust.\" Now, out of nowhere, with no advance notice, Reznor is back with NIN's sixth album, the instrumental \"Ghosts I-IV.\"\n\n\"A soundtrack for daydreams,\" is how Reznor sums up the new album...and that, I feel, is the best way to appreciate the new NIN. Rather than listening to this album as background music while driving or doing housework, \"Ghosts I-IV\" is best appreciated with relaxed, yet concentrated listening. Lie in bed or on the sofa, relaxed, and immerse yourself with this CD. Just sort of daydream--meditate, think about whatever...and let \"Ghosts I-IV\" be the soundtrack...\n\nAnd as the mood of the album changes, allow your mood to flow with the album...try to get lost in the music.\n\nSome have commented that \"Ghosts I-IV\" sounds similar in style to the instrumental music from \"The Fragile,\" (1999) but I don't know if it's all that accurate to say that. While the instrumental music from \"the Fragile\" sort of held the vocal compositions from that CD together like glue, \"Ghosts I-IV\" is a little more \"out there.\" It can, therefore, be seen as a mosaic--of several different styles--piano compositions, industrial beats, the avant-garde--all mixed together, with no real dominant flavor overpowering the rest. And while the album is all-over-the-place, treading many territories, everything works; \"Ghosts I-IV\" takes so many twists-and-turns-its always interesting. At the same time, with almost two hours of music to absorb, \"Ghosts I-IV\" is best appreciated with repeated listens--to fully appreciate all its' rich textures and intricacy.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Being a fan of Drake when he first initially started in the music industry and seeing his progression as an artist has left me wondering if he really has anything left to offer both musically and artistically. I've caught a lot of buzz about this album through social media saying this album is great, but man this was just sad. Thank Me Later and Take Care were good albums, and Nothing Was the Same was decent, but this is just pure lazy music for Drake. For those who don't know, this album is labeled as a \"mixtape\" and should have been treated as such. A mixtape should not be sold for retail, it should be distributed as a free project to the masses which makes me want to ask Drake, \"why not just call this an album?\" If someone could give me a good example of an artist selling their mixtape online, please leave a comment below, because this is just ridiculous on Drake's part.\n\nAs an album running 17 songs (19 on the physical release) it is seriously a waste of time in my opinion. The beats are very generic, the lyrics are just about money, girls and fame... and the album cover just demonstrates the kind of effort Drake put into this project; ZERO. As a consumer of music, I believe that Drake is just exploiting his fan base at this point, and I can't believe the positive responses this project has been receiving lately. If you enjoyed this album, then that's your M.O., but as for me I am done with Drake at this point.","classification":1,"fold":4}

I liked the collaboration between The Hot Boys (Juvenile, B.G., Lil Wayne and Turk) so I decided to pick up&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Guerrilla-Warfare\/dp\/B00000JNNW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Guerrilla Warfare<\/a>, which was released in July of '99.  Since I liked most of the songs that Lil Wayne was featured on, I picked up his solo release&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tha-Block-Is-Hot\/dp\/B00002MYVJ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tha Block Is Hot<\/a>, which was released in November of the same year.  The title track was the 1st single and I also liked the tracks \"High Beamin'\" w\/B.G.,  \"Kisha\" which featured The Hot Boys and \"Loud Pipes\" which featured Juvenile, B.G. and The Big Tymers (Mannie Fresh and Baby).  The entire CD was pretty good so when Lil Wayne dropped&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Lights-Out\/dp\/B000053UDL\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Lights Out<\/a>&nbsp;a year later, I didn't hesitate to pick it up.  This CD wasn't as good as \"The Block Is Hot\" in my opinion, but I still liked tracks such as \"Hit U Up\" and \"Shine\", which both featured The Hot Boys, and the 1st single \"Get Off The Corner\".\n\nSince No Limit Records and Cash Money Records were both on a decline, I didn't pick up any other Cash Money releases until Lil Wayne released&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tha-Carter\/dp\/B00027JYPI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tha Carter<\/a>&nbsp;in 2004.  Once I heard the singles \"Bring It Back\" and \"Go DJ\", I figured the CD would be a decent pick up and I was right.  My favorite track was \"BM J.R.\" and the majority of the CD was a quality listen.  A year later, Lil Wayne released&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tha-Carter-II\/dp\/B000BLI4UG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tha Carter II<\/a>.  This CD was even better than \"Tha Carter\", in my opinion, and my favorite tracks were \"Money On My Mind\", \"Best Rapper Alive\", \"Shooter\" w\/Robin Thicke and \"Tha Mobb\".\n\nSince the release of \"Tha Carter 2\", Lil Wayne has released several mixtapes and has appeared on several other CDs from other down south rappers, r&b singers, and even on Jay Z's \"American Gangster\" CD on the track \"Hello Brooklyn 2.0\".  Lil Wayne was also featured on Kanye West's \"Graduation\" CD on the track \"Barry Bonds\".  Finally, after several delays Lil Wayne released \"Tha Carter 3\" on June 10, 2008.\n\nThe first single \"Lollipop\" features the late Static Major, who was in the r&b group Playa and wrote and produced songs for the late Aaliyah Haughton and Timbaland.  \"Lollipop\" is suitable for the club and house parties but that's about it, in my opinion.  Lil Wayne uses the tired voice recorder that T-Pain has made famous lately, but people who have listened to music for years know that it was made famous first by the late, great Roger Troutman of Zapp.  T-Pain is featured on another forgettable track in \"Got Money\".  The second the track comes on you will be wanting to hit the skip button.  \"3 Peat\" starts the CD as Lil Wayne is fresstyling and \"Maestro\" delivers a decent beat.  I have heard better Lil Wayne freestyles but \"3 Peat\" does get the CD off to a decent start.\n\"Mr. Carter\" is alot better as Lil Wayne and Jay-Z rip the track to shreds.  Wayne could have left the last verse off of the song, but \"Mr. Carter\" is easily one of the best tracks on \"Tha Carter 3\".  \"A Milli\" officially shuts the CD down.  When I first heard this CD, I had to play \"A Milli\" 3 times in a row before I could go on to another track.  \"Bangladesh\" who produced another Down South favorite of mine, 8Ball & MJG's \"You Don't Want Drama\", definitely produces a banger in \"A Milli\".  This is what every Lil Wayne freestyle should sound like.  Kanye West produces the smooth, grown and sexy track \"Comfortable\", which features Babyface.  Lil Wayne basically tells the lady in his life at the moment that she shouldn't get too comfortable in the realtionship if she isn't going to play her part in it.  Swizz Beatz shows up to produce another banger in \"Dr. Carter\" as Lil Wayne is able to give his prescription to any rappers lacking style, charisma and the abilities to what \"he\" thinks it takes to make it in the rap game in 2008.  Cool & Dre show up to produce \"Phone Home\".  Once you past the fact that Lil Wayne is calling himself a martian, you will be able to enjoy the lyrics and the beat.  This track is definitely one of the better songs on \"Tha Carter 3\".  Robin Thicke produces and is featured on \"Tie My Hands\" which has Lil Wayne discussing the mind state of New Orleans and how he feels about everything before and after Hurricane Katrina.  Bobby Valentino, who recently left Ludacris and DTP, is featured on the smooth \"Mrs. Officer\" as Wayne makes a playful story up about pushin' up on a female police officer.  \"Let The Beat Bulid\" is produced by Kanye West and has Lil Wayne on another freestyle mission.  The first part of the track is pretty good, but Wayne should have quit while he was ahead because the last verse isn't as good as the other verses are on the song.  \"Shoot Me Down\" features some nice vocals from D. Smith as Lil Wayne is able to get some things off his chest, while still maintaining decent lyrics at the same time.  David Banner does it again on the nice \"La, La\" which features Busta Rhymes and Brisco.  The beat sounds like something your child could play on a xylophone but after a few listens you will be bobbin' your head like I do everytime I hear the track.  \"Pyaying With Fire\" features Betty Wright, who I remember from the \"After The Pain\" and \"No Pain, No Gain\" Video Jukebox days.  Lil Wayne's lyrics could have been better but Streetrunner will keep your attention with the production.  Alchemist, who is currently Eminem's DJ and is better known for producing tracks for Mobb Deep and \"We Gon' Make It\" by Jadakiss, produces \"You Ain't Got Nuthin'\".  Fabolous steals the show as his verse on this track is better than any verse than he had on his last CD, \"From Nothin' To Somethin'\".  Juelz Santana took the day off and Lil Wayne tries his best to keep up with Fabolous.  \"Don't Get It\" uses the same sample that Common used for the track \"Misunderstood\" on his last CD, \"Finding Forever\".  Lil Wayne ends \"The Carter 3\" on a nice note as he even takes time to give his thoughts on certain issues going on in the Black community today and his opinions of the Reverend Al Sharpton.\n\nOverall, if you can look past \"Lollipop\" and \"Got Money\", I feel that you have a pretty good CD by Lil Wayne.  If you were a fan of \"Tha Carter 1\" and \"Tha Carter 2\", then you should also add \"Tha Carter 3\" to your collection.  If you are tired of hearing Lil Wayne on 50 different mixtapes and on 100 diffrent collaborations, then this might not be the CD for you.  If you are into the Down South rap music scene of 2008, which would be Outkast, Scarface, TI, Bun B, Young Buck, Chamillionaire, David Banner and others, then you should also pick this CD up as well.  Lil Wayne isn't for everybody, but if you actually sit down and give this CD a fair listen, then you won't be disappointed in my opinion.\n\nJames' Top 5\n\n1) A Milli\n2) Tie My Hands w\/Robin Thicke\n3) Mr. Carter w\/Jay-Z\n4) Dr. Carter\n5) Comfortable w\/Babyface\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\n Phone Home\n Let The Beat Build\n Don't Get It (Too much talking during the end of the track)\n La La w\/Busta Rhymes & Brisco\n Mrs. Officer w\/Bobby Valentino","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":4}

It showed that the guys from Ireland know how to make great melodies, with just a bit of chemistry. Sadly though I wish I could've said it a little better with their latest single, Nothing, the second single from their sophmore album Science & Faith. The song is alright, but not anything to rave about. It just wasn't as strong as some of their other hits were.

They symphony playing along with John sounds way more soulful than anything ELO ever managed. \"#9 Dream\" is one of those moments where John's artsy side yields something absolutely lovely, as opposed to, say, his artsy side yielding something like \"Two Virgins\".

{"text":"There are sometimes moments where a remake can be a strong moment for the world, or a song that has lost all of the luster in the world. That unfortunately is the case with the remake of We Are The World 25 For Haiti. I really felt with all of the chemistry from Rihanna, tween sensation Justin Bieber, Kanye West and Josh Groban tried to deliver as well as many others, didn't really seem to spark nor ignite the magic and star power that the original We Are The World had definitely showed 25 years ago, when Lionel Richie & Michael Jackson originally worte the song for African famine relief. While the thought of having a bit from the original recording of Michael's voice is a sentimental part of the song, the overall chemistry from each of the singers just wasn't as strong. If you really want to make a strong contribution to those suffering in Haiti, try a song from the Hope For Haiti digital album instead. I also felt the feeling of remaking the song was a bit too soon, especially because of Michael Jackson's death back in June. If you want to download the song though, it still is for a good cause, and that is a way to help Haiti recover from the heartbreak it is going thorugh right now.\n\nSong: C 1\/2-","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"Hard to believe today it is 5 years since Michael Jackson tragically lost his own life the way he did. I definitely do not think Michael Jackson forgot all the years he was judged as a pedophile and wacko jacko. Still he still had some great songs towards the end of his career and his life. You Rock My World, one of his last hit songs originally from the lackluster Invincible album is still one of those few standouts from that album that is playing well. It showed a more R&B rhythm to the appeal that Michael Jackson wanted to get into a generation that was getting into Destiny's Child, TLC and when a lot of R&B really was going more into a dance and hip hop rhythm. It really was a good song, but one of Michael Jackson's last to really hit the nail on the head. If you would prefer Michael's music from the afterlife, as it was released from the Xscape record, you should absolutely go back to what made Michael Jackson a legend in the first place, and get Invincible with You Rock My World.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":4}

Jorn's style of singing is strong and passionate and he displays his influences strongly. The album consists of a great collection of covers and one superb original composition that fits easily with the rest of the album. The production is massive as we have come to expect from previous Jorn solo albums and the music just hammers out of the speakers. Highlights include the opening tribute \"Song For Ronnie James\", the slow groove of \"Shame On The Night\", the epic sound of \"Lord Of The Last Day\", and the killer version of \"Lonely Is The Day\". This album is highly recommended to fans of Jorn Lande and represents a strong addition to his impressive solo catalogue.","classification":4,"fold":4}

For starters, that hypnotic \"Get Up, Get Up, Get Up, Get Up\" hook that is softly whispered over the rhythmic beat calls us into the theme of the track. Marvin's voice is like that of an ecstatic angel living with one foot in the clouds and another in the entrance way to the bedroom. I can picture hips gyrating, beautiful women dancing in the background, red satin sheets, candles, rose petals and the whole bit.\n\nIn all my years of listening to music, never have I heard a song quite so stirring and smooth. Marvin states in no uncertain times that he is seeking some sexual healing from his partner (or partners) and is not shy about laying his cards right out there throughout the duration of the song. The song starts beautifully and truly ends too quickly.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Now, this mp3 set of the complete harpsichord works of J.S.Bach doesn't actually have EVERYTHING, as his transcriptions of other composer's works are not included. Nor are any minor or perhaps spurious works. But pretty much everything else of consequence is included. It's a motherlode of music for the harpsichord by perhaps the greatest composer the instrument ever knew. Tons of great stuff, from the English and French Suites, to the Partitas and Toccatas, to both books of the Well-Tempered Clavier, to the Goldberg Variations and Inventions. My one quibble is that this music can get very repetitive very quickly. Of course, there is no way of playing dynamics on a harpsichord, so there is no real difference between soft and loud. Work after work can sound pretty much the same. Thank God Bach was such a stupendous genius!\n  Martin Galling is a name that I'm not too familiar with, but he plays wonderfully, if a bit sewing-machine like at times. This is something the real Bach freaks will love. Moderate classical music listeners might like it too for it's immense size (over 15 hours says the label on the front). Glenn Gould fans should run away, run far away! But overall, I can't really say much more than: Recommended.---------------------------PEACE","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Originally released in 1982, this was the follow-up to his 'Special Forces' effort (see my review). 'Zipper Catches Skin' is a rather 'off' the beaten path lp for Alice. That's not to say it doesn't have good songs, because it does. Tunes I thought were good were \"Zorro's Ascent\" (it's got a great beat to it), the radio friendly \"I Like Girls\" (with guest vocalist The Waitress's Patty Donahue - R.I.P.), \"Tag,You're It\" and \"I'm Alive (That Was The Day My Dead Pet Returned to Save My Life)\". There's a cut here \"I Am The Future\" that at first I didn't remember where I've heard it before. Turns out it was part of the movie soundtrack for 'Class Of '84'. Line-up: Alice - vocals, Mike Pinera & Richard Wagner - guitars, Erik Scott - bass, Duane Hitchings - synthesizer and Jan Uvena - drums. Make not a classic, but [very] decent.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"My granddaughter wanted us to rent Gods and Generals because she was learning about the Civil War at school. So we rented to movie and started playing it.  The first thing I heard was the song during the opening credits.  That voice sounds familiar, I thought to myself.  So out came the trusty smartphone and after a couple of minutes on the Internet I found this song.  Sure enough, the singer is Mary Fahl, from October Project, one of my favorites.  So I got the mp3 and have been enjoying it immensely.  There is a Celtic flavor to the song that really speaks to me.  I may end up getting the whole album, since I already have 2 October Project albums that I like.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"As a couple other reviewers here have observed, the small handful of songs on this record that are good are REALLY good, but you will have to wade through a dozen other just ok songs that are virtually indecipherable from one another to get to them.\n\nLyrically this is definitely Gwen Stefanis most introspective and personal record to date, though I would argue she hasn't gotten enough credit in the past for writing understated, poignant tunes (Wonderful Life, Early Winter, etc). But unfortunately this time around it seems she had a difficult time incorporating those meaningful sentiments into songs that are also catchy, or even memorable. The radio singles like Used to Love You and Make Me Like You are fun enough in the moment and may get your head bopping for a few minutes but surely won't solidify themselves in your brain the way What You Waiting You or Hollaback Girl did a decade ago  and continue to today. I don't dislike the straightforward, mid-tempo, electro-reggae pop sound that permeates 90% of the record, necessarily, but it certainly does make it extra difficult to find any tracks that stand out from the rest as immediately identifiable. The album closer, Rare, is a highlight but twelve songs in it may just be too little, too late. My favorite song is actually one found on the Target edition of the disc; Getting Warmer starts off with a classical vibe and elevates into an experimental techno piece, blending elements I think work really well together. Definitely worth the upgrade if you can get a hold of it.\n\nEven though my overall assessment of okay but instantly forgettable may sound a bit harsh, there actually isn't much here I would call actively terrible. Well, aside from Red Flag which has Gwen trying perhaps a little TOO hard to channel the sassiness of early No Doubt, and Asking 4 It which is entirely unintelligible. Otherwise, her voice is top notch these days and I appreciate her willingness to be lyrically provocative, even if the music itself isn't terribly inspired. If you're an existing fan there are things to like here, for sure, but if you're not already on the Gwen Stefani train this one probably won't bring you aboard, either, so I figure a middle of the road 3-star rating is about fair.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"This is a supurb collection of Folk Music. It was released in 1998,but is really Folk Music of the 60's ,all of it written by the person who was the central figure of the Folk Music scene at the height of its popularity. It was the music that represented the thoughts,experiences,hopes,fears,dreams,heartbreaks,protests and just about everything that the music scene portrayed during the sixties. However,anyone familiar with this music is in for a big surprise and treat when they listen to this album. While everything ,all 39 recordings,are from Seeger,all but one,\"And Still I'm Searching\" are other artist's interpreting Seeger's songs. It will be a great surprise for you,as it certainly was for me, to hear these artists singing Seeger's songs. Also,you will find many songs in this collection that will probably be totally new ,or at least somewhat forgotten.\n There are songs that have become so familiar to long time Folkies as well as mainstream listeners, that when done by others will ,to use an old expression,\"knock your socks off\".\n Just to captivate your curiosity,can you imagine:\n  Jackson Browne & Bonnie Raitt singing \"Kisses Sweeter Than Wine\"\n  Bruce Cockburn singing \"Turn,Turn,Turn\"\n  Nanci Griffith and Friends singing \"If I Had A Hammer\"\n  Bruce Springsteen singing \"We Shall Overcome\"\n  Studs Terkel doing \"Blessed Be The Nation\" or \"Oh,Sacred World\"\n  And what would a Folk Music collection be without\nPeter,Paul & Mary,The Weavers and \"Wimoweh\",Odetta and \"One Grain Of Sand\"\n Then to wrap it all up,Pete tells us what his long journey in Folk Music has been all about with \"And Still I'm Searching.\n If you are a Folk Music fan, or a fan of American Music heritage;you'll treasure this collection. The inserts that are included with these two CD's are excellent and will give you a much greater insight into what was on Seeger's mind at the time and how he came about to compose these songs.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Although there are several greatest hits packages available for Earth Wind & Fire, most notably the Best of EWF Volumes 1 & 2, their Greatest Hits compliation which was released by Columbia Records in 1998 is easily the best one available. Containing most of the band's hits as well as lesser known tracks that are just as strong, Greatest Hits is the perfect introduction to this talented band's music.\n\n Simply put, every track here is top notch with most of them hitting the Top Ten on both the pop singles and black singles charts. The tracks \"Mighty Mighty\", \"Saturday Nite\", and their only #1 pop single \"Shining Star\" are excellent funk songs punctuated by their trademark snappy horn lines. The tracks \"September\", \"Serpentine Fire\", and \"Sing A Song\" are near perfect pop songs with soaring harmonies and melodies that stay in your head immediately upon first listen. Their late-70's hits \"Let's Groove\" and \"Boogie Wonderland\" are very strong disco tracks with the former track aging wonderfully compared to most of the music from that genre. While the harmonies are strong on all of their material, harmonizing doesn't get much better than on \"Getaway\", arguably the finest song they've ever recorded. The ballads here are all fantastic with \"After The Love Has Gone\", \"That's The Way Of The World\", and \"Reasons\" being not only among the best recorded in the '70s, but of any era. Other great tracks here include their cover of the Beatles' \"Got To Get You Into My Life\", \"Fantasy\", and \"Kalimba's Story.\" This is a phenomenal greatest hits album that should be part of every music fan's collection. Highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":4}

Never Want To Live Without You  - The album opens with a nice slow which showcases Benet's voice in top form.  **** out of ****\n\n2. Feel Good (feat. Faith Evans)  - I still remember the first duet (Georgie Porgy) Faith & Eric did from Benet's A Day In The Life album. Eleven years later the chemistry is still there with this grown & sexy party jam.  Faith Evans is proving to be a go to duet partner with this song and her recent grown & sexy duet Lay With You with El. Debarge from his new album Second Chance. **** out of ****\n\n3. Sometimes I Cry  - The lead single where Benet uses his falsetto to work wonders. Listening to this song and seeing the video I was reminded of the classic Lenny Williams song Cause I Love You. **** of out ****\n4. Always A Reason  - This is another smooth slow jam, that reminded me of the classic song Sideshow by Blue Magic. **** out of ****\n\n5. Paid (feat. Eddie Levert)  - I've never know Benet' to duet with male singer but this song sounds like one of the best songs The O `Jays never recorded. **** out of ****\n\n6. Take It (feat. Chrisette Michele)  -The second female duet on the album, this is more a modernized song and the lovely Chrisette Michele's voice complaint's Benet's voice very well. **** out of ****.\n\n7. Stir It Up  - This is another modernized song and just makes you feel good while listening to it. *** out of ****\n8. Summer Love (feat. India Bent)  - Benet brings it back to the old school with this song and I could easily see Stevie Wonder singing a song like this during his Songs in the Key of Life era. Benet's daughter also shows that talent runs in the family. **** out of ****\n\n9. Lost In Time  - Another amazing ballad which is remiscent of the doo wop sound of the fifties and sixties. **** out of ****\n\n10. Good Life (feat. Ledisi)  - Now an Eric Benet album wouldn't be complete without something to dance to. Listening to this song I found myself snapping my fingers and just motivated to dance.  **** out of ****\n\n11. Something's Wrong  - The album's closes out with a jazz infused ballad, which once again showcases one of the finest voices in R&B today. **** out of  ****\n\nEric Benet has produced a excellent fifth album which continues to show his talent as a singer.

Its echoes are clearly heard in Hearts Green Aphrodisiac, a cache of 70s-style quiet storm, complete with serene Fender Rhodes, growling and lightly slapped bass, skittering delayed guitar plucks, and cooed background harmonies (featuring Esperanza Spalding), topped with Raes increasingly animated vocals.  She parts the clouds with unyielding optimism in The Skies Will Break; the song opens with a catchy Bm-A-D-G, Em-D-F#m-G piano figure, then flips to a punching G-A-Bbdim7-Bm progression that carries the song to heights unprecedented for Rae, only to break to nothing for the heart speaks in whispers chorus line  a perfect mix of dynamics and drive.  And except for the absence of stratospheric trills, Do You Ever Think of Me is pure Minnie Riperton in its unvarnished innocence.

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music.

{"text":"While it both alienated the band and made an indelible mark on rock music, Nirvana's 1991 breakthrough \"Nevermind\" is a rock classic. Bringing Seattle's moody grunge music to the big stage, \"Nevermind\" succeeds on great songwriting and Kurt Cobain's character. Although about 90% of the album has become rock radio staples, it carries an independent spirit. But even with the alternative feel, the album can be loved by anyone because it has undeniable hooks and song structure. Nirvana is loud, driving, and angry as ever here, and Cobain's moodiness is a perfect match for the music. The snarling guitars seem to complement his sentiments. Despite all the talk of mutilation and death, Cobain is truly appealing; you can almost feel his pain. He is depressed and disturbed, but he is such an effective songwriter and lyricist that he's almost always understandable. \"Nevermind\" sounds great and somehow, through all the depressing material, is great fun.\n\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" opens the album with unarguably one of the greatest songs of the 90s. The hard-rocking guitars, well-toned verses, and Cobain's performance made this song a classic for the ages, and the subject matter inspired a generation of rock music. The moody, midtempo \"In Bloom\" has an innate appeal to it, and the classic \"Come As You Are\" is my favorite Nirvana song, for Kurt's down-to-earth philosophy and the wonderful songwriting. \"Breed\" is menacing yet catchy, and \"Lithium\" is one of the album's best cuts. You can almost feel Kurt about to collapse under the optimism of the opening verses, and the sunny music gives way to a loud and driving hook. \"Polly\" is so effective because over simple guitar strums, Cobain's words are disturbed and unstable. \"Territorial Pissings\" is short and strong, and \"Drain You\" is Cobain and Nirvana at their best. \"Lounge Act\" and \"Stay Away\" boast great instrumentals and passionate performance, and \"On a Plain\" is immediately endearing and catchy. The album closes with the somber \"Something in the Way,\" a moving 20-minute (mostly silent) track.\n\nLegions of grunge imitators would find their way to major labels in the aftermath of \"Nevermind,\" and Nirvana would continue a short-lived stardom as grunge icons until Cobain's suicide. \"Nevermind\" is their landmark recording, and should be owned by anyone curious or new to the band. For those familiar with \"Nevermind,\" I recommend their follow-up&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/In-Utero\/dp\/B000003TAR\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">In Utero<\/a>&nbsp;and their other less well-known albums.","classification":5,"fold":4}

Her lead single, Work with Drake really was terrible, and she only showed that her vocals were tired and sincerely choppy, possibly using drugs. Kiss It Better, the second single from Anti doesn't ignite either. She tries to show her sex appeal, but instead falls short of where her work should really be.

{"text":"During the December of 2010 a lot of excellent R&B and soul albums were being released at roughly the same time by Ron Isley,El Debarge,Charlie Wilson the the newer Chrisette Michelle. I myself had always enjoyed Eric Benet since the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/True-to-Myself\/dp\/B000002KQU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">True to Myself<\/a>&nbsp;days when he was merely and up and coming neo souler in the vein of DeAngelo and Maxwell. As with those two at the time he had something to proove musically but in many ways since than the modern music scene and Benet's own personel journey have led him to the place I'd always been hoping he'd go. Even today neosoul is defined as a rather retro sounding music that,in some way must owe some sort of musical debt to whatever digital hip-hop style or rapper is popular at the moment. Intricately crafted songs are not priorities but rather simple,sing-along hooks with the overkilled \"Whoh ho,whoh ho,whoh ho!\" chant are the order of the day. Either that or you have overly naturalness obsessed performers who through their insistance on live instrumentation in ones face to such a degree it's slightly off putting. Now in the case of Benet's tribute to 70's R&B styles here he manages to strike the right balance,as only a select few modern albums have between live instrumentation,in the pocket production and extremely well crafted songs.\n\n  Much of the music here is highly inspired by Thom Belle and soul balladeers of the early 70's such as The Delfonics. \"Never Want To Be Without You\",\"Sometimes I Cry\",\"Always A Reason\" and the title song will all attest to that as they feature the same kind of scaling melody,strong accentuating horns and even that defining electric sitar type of sound. It's at the time that the albums tempo goes up that it really gets great. Now in terms of retro soul it's all too easy to fall into the obvious clishe of doing just ballads and midtempo  numbers even if well done. But when you have songs like \"Feel Good\" and \"Good Life\",recorded with Faith Evans and Ledisi respectively you know your in a good place:these songs take the funk\/disco\/soul hybrid of the early 80's now called \"boogie\",with it's string and horn charts and churning rhythm sections and hooks mixed with modern mixing and production techniques for a very potent and funky experience. The O'Jays Eddie Levert comes in on \"Paid\",a churning,wah wah guitar powered update of the classic Gamble\/Huff Philly funk sound (very close to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Back-Stabbers\/dp\/B00160ANKK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Back Stabbers<\/a>&nbsp;in fact) whose message reflects how the socio econmic status of the 70's paralells to todays similar issues and how vital yearning and less confrontational and profane message songs are to contemporary R&B music.\n\n  The album is rounded off with the jazzier Billy Paul styled tribute \"Something's Wrong\" and,as with much of the other romantically themed music on this album we see someone who has learned from the mistake of having been a philanderer in their youth and has an important message for their audience not to make the same mistake and why. It's by no means beggy and preacher-most of the time the powerful music and Benet's trademark carmely vocal delivery tell most of the story. And while I must admit live instrumentation is always vital to R&B and always will be it's even more wonderful to see them in the hands of someone who produces them in the best way possible and,equally so does so without restorting to any modern clishes:most important of which is that need to owe some debt to the currently overdone hip-hop\/R&B genre. Yes this album will naturally have an appeal to anyone whose musical tastes were guided by the 70's and early 80's R&B generation but is also quite encouraging to younger up and comers who see that the kind of music with the kind of production they've loved FROM these people hasn't disappeared and can be expanded on for todays audience. And for that alone,even if unintended I thank Eric Benet for releasing this album as it is.","classification":5,"fold":4}

Before I saw them, I bought this CD and was immediately impressed by the quality of the band's playing and of their songs.  In concert, they not only lived up to the high quality of the music on the CD, but they surpassed it, with some real tasty jams and great vocals.  Anyway, there are many strong songs on this CD, with the opening three numbers being especially great songs, with \"Fall\", being my favorite.  \"Ruby\" is a kick also, with some 'fun' lyrics which are not of your typical 'love song'.  Both \"Ramblin' Boy\" and \"Gold and Roses\" feature Tom Pryor on pedal steel guitar.  He's especially strong in concert (as is the rest of the band)!  I highly recommend this CD by the Black Lillies.  While I do tend to favor the rockers on CD, the slower, sweeter songs offer a good change of pace on Runaway Freeway Blues.

All of them I have  heard and I must say they are not so obscure...if you have followed this artist. So I guess I don't really get the point of this album. His  original recordings are all superior. An odd way to reintroduce some really great songs from a storied past. Stick to the past.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"When it has came down what Janelle Monae had shown in music, she has more in her voice than almost all of the artists of today in the music industry. But sadly, she has been overlooked in the credibility in favor the annoying Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna. Her collaboration with Erykah Badu Q.U.E.E.N. from her sophmore album The Electric Lady is definitely a great collaboration. I love how rhythmic Janelle brings her voice into the song and the rhythm staying connected to the artists of soul that had inspired her to sing. It shows that she has a great rhythm into the song for old school and contemporary R&B that many of today's artists disregard well. This is a great song to dance to, and a nice follow-up to what she had with Tightrope a few years ago.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":4}

A couple of the CD's rockers I also liked were \"Ride The Dragon\" and \"Power Of The Sword\". This was the band's seventh lp. Might be their best work since 1984's 'Hail To England'.

{"text":"I should say upfront that I am a Tangerine Dream of the old days, the Virgin releases era really (1973-1983), and I lost interest in the band pretty much in the late 1980s. Couldn't stand the band's eventual drift into new age, mixes, and whatever else. But when I read about this album, I was intrigued, and so on a whim really, sound unheard, I purchased this from Amazon recently. I must add that I'm into another phase of being into electronic music from watching the excellent \"Kraftwerk and the Electronic Revolution\" DVD, which explores the German music scene in the 70s, including of course Kraftwerk, but also Klaus Schulze, Cluster, Harmonia, and Tangerine Dream, among others.\n\n\"Booster\" (2 CDs, 16 tracks, 114 min.) is a curious mix. I was immediately skeptical when I read the liner notes, which tell us \"Some titles have been exclusively compiled 2007 from various Tangerine Dream releases\", and then that only a couple of tracks (3 in fact) are unreleased. After a tentative opener \"One Night In Space\" though, I am very charmed by the 14+ min. \"Hyper Sphinx\", which reminds me of latter 80s Tangerine Dream, nicely done. The re-recording of classic tracks \"Logos\" and \"Tangram\" are worthless, as they only want to make you want to listen to the original tracks. But there are several other highlights, none better than the 14+ min set closer \"Bells of Acra\", which I really like.\n\nIt is surely not a coincidence that I liked the 2 longest tracks on here by far. That said, this is not the return of the Tangerine Dream of old, but it surely is the best new music I've heard from Edgar Froese in, well, forever. Is it 'essential' to have? no, but it's decent enough.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"We're seeing more of these classical music collections on Amazon, and this one is superb. Nearly half of the tracks are from the outstanding Bach Collegium Japan (BCJ), or its conductor, complemented by an assortment of other skilled performers. Here's what we have in this album.\n\nTracks 1-3 Brandenburg Concerto No. 3, BCJ -- Performed at an astonishingly breakneck pace (especially the third movement), the strings are skillful and lyrical. At this very upbeat tempo, the third movement becomes an unfolding of changing textures, in the spirit of Philip Glass, which is an interesting change from other slower performances. Like all the BCJ tracks here, the recording is superb.\n\n4 Toccata and Fugue in D Minor -- A polished and enjoyable performance, like many other recordings of this work. For a very different interpretation that I like better, filled with energy, check out Bach Organ Blaster, with Michael Murray as the organist.\n\n5-7 Brandenburg Concerto No. 5, again with the BCJ. -- Very nice, and well-recorded. The harpsichord solo in the first movement is not my favorite interpretation, but it's fine and precise in every way.\n\n8 Prelude in C Minor for Solo Lute -- Mellow, nicely recorded.\n\n9-13 Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D Major, BCJ -- Another fine performance from the BCJ, and wonderfully recorded. A gem.\n\n14-20 Orchestral Suite No. 2 in B Minor, Drottningholm Baroque Ensemble -- Very good sound, and a solid performance in the European style. Includes the famous Bourree which does not disappoint.\n\n21-26 Partita No. 3 in E Major -- This virtuoso work for solo violin is performed by the very accomplished Nobuko Imai. Solid. The Rondo in the third movement is one of my favorite Bach pieces.\n\n27-31 Partita No. 2 in D Minor -- Another virtuoso work for solo violin. Recorded in a larger hall than the previous Partita, so it has a different sound. Conrad von der Goltz is also very good. I think I like Nobuko Imai's performance of the No. 3 a bit better.\n\n32 Sheep May Safely Graze, from Cantata BWV 208 -- This is performed by a brass band, which is a very different sound than the usual baroque orchestra. It's a very nice mellow sound.\n\n33-42 Cantata BWV 147, BCJ -- Includes the famous chorale Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring. A beautiful performance of the full cantata, very nicely recorded, with excellent soloists.\n\n43 Fugue in G Minor for Solu Lute -- Very nice performance of music that Bach also used in different settings.\n\n44-49 Six Schubler Chorales -- Performed by Hans Fagius, organist. The sound is very spacious and pleasing. Fagius uses good voicing on the organ.\n\n50 Aria and 30 Variations from the Goldberg Variations -- Very nice harpsichord, and very well recorded.\n\n51-53 Sonata in E-Flat Major for Flute and Harpsichord -- Very pleasing performance and recording, but to my ear not distinguished in any particular way.\n\n54 Adagio in B Minor from the Easter Oratorio, BCJ -- The Easter Oratorio is one of my favorite Bach works. The Adagio is slow and plaintive. Nicely recorded as are all the BCJ tracks.\n\n55-60 Suite No. 1 in G Major -- This is a virtuoso work for solo cello. Torleif Thedeen's tone and technique are great. And it's recorded very nicely. You'll often hear more than one string on the cello played together. This is a difficult technique to master, and integral to this work (and also to the earlier Partitas for violin). Solid.\n\n61-66 Concerto No. 2 in E Major, BCJ -- Another wonderful performance from the BCJ. Just beautiful in every way.\n\n67 Fugue in G Minor -- This is the famous Little Fugue for organ. This is performed on a small organ (or at least with small voicing), which suits the piece well. The tempo is very moderate. I'm accustomed to hearing this played at a somewhat more upbeat tempo. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable recording.\n\n68-73 Suite in E Minor for Solo Lute -- Again by Jakob Lindberg, this is a polished performance. The solo lute is mellow and relaxing. Try this one as background music over a romantic dinner.\n\n74-76 Double Concerto in D Minor, BCJ -- Yet another very fine recording from the BCJ.\n\n77-79 Double Concerto in C Minor, BCJ -- Also from the BCJ, and excellent in every way. The solo oboe is beautiful and lyrical.\n\n80 Fantasia and Fugue in G Minor -- An organ work performed by Otto Winter. Fine in every way, but also check out the very energetic recording of this on Bach Organ Blaster by Michael Murray.\n\n81-85 Inventions for Harpsichord -- Performed by Masaaki Suzuki, founder and conductor of the BCJ. Excellent performances, and very nicely recorded.\n\n86-88 Concerto in A Major -- Solid performance in old-school European style.\n\n89-91 Concerto in G Minor -- Another performance in the European style. The tempo should be a bit faster, in my humble opinion. But a nice recording, very enjoyable.\n\n92 Suite No. 3 in C Major -- This virtuoso work for solo cello is performed very nicely by Torleif Thedeen. Romantic and lyrical.\n\n93-100 Mass in B Minor (highlights), BCJ -- The B-minor mass is one of Bach's best large works. The perfomance is solid, the recording impeccable. Excellent chorus and soloists.\n\nIn summary, this is an excellent collection, and an impressive value. Most of the performances are superb, and there aren't any real losers here at all. Highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Gojira returns with a masterful album that sees them taking steps forward without making any jarring stylistic changes. Magma's melancholic atmosphere coincides with the loss of Joe and Mario Duplantier's mother, who sadly passed away as they worked on the album. Even in the heaviest tracks, you can feel an innate sadness that serves as both mourning and tribute. It's therefore not surprising that what may be their softest, and incidentally most accessible, song to date, The Shooting Star, leads off the album and sets the tone right away. Lest longtime fans fear a new direction, the gears quickly shift into far heavier territory for the next several songs, and really the entire core of the album. While these songs, by the band's own admission, involve less complexity than what might be typically expected of them, I found myself over and over either banging my head along with the tracks or shaking it in wonder at some ridiculously unconventional moments of metal oddity. The back-to-back freakiness of The Cell and Stranded (tracks 3 and 4) might best exemplify what I'm talking about. Both songs recall the glories of albums past, but infuse more atmosphere in the guitar melodies and increased use of clean vocals. This band has shown growth throughout each chapter of their career, and that continues here, as seen in the title track, which combines Swans-like vocals, quirky, otherworldy guitar noises, subdued but signature riffs, and a crushing riff in the midsection. The album is regretfully short, as only eight of the ten songs are full tracks. Yellowstone and Liberation are both spare instrumentals that I could honestly take or leave, but I'm sure some will find that they add dynamics to the overall listen. Before the closing Liberation, Magma rolls toward the finish with a triad of heavy, but atmospheric, songs that finish off an extremely strong album. Gojira once again impressively represents a newer generation of metal that needs more obvious champions as the legendary acts from the '80's and '90's begin to wind down their careers. This band should be at the top of the game in the next decade or more going forward.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"After all the releases from 1977 that have come forth lately you may of thought that was the only year that The Grateful Dead played concerts but here we go into 1978 to a town called \"Normal\" and a nice Bettyboard of the band's show at the Horton Field House in April of 1978. This is known as the year that The Grateful Dead made it to Egypt and performed three shows at the foot of the Sphinx and those shows and the return to San Francisco and the shows there at Winterland (\"From Egypt With Love\") have already been let loose to the public. Another thing noteworthy of 1978 is that Drums>Space became a regular center  of the band's 2nd set in February of this year and remained in place until the end in 1995.\n\nThe \"Dave's Picks\" series has been really great as Dave and his pals have turned out some really great moments of live Dead and Vol. 1 - Vol. 6 have been really fantastic. When I received this latest 'Pick' I played disc two first as I had a feeling (rightfully so) that this was going to be the right place to dive into this one. There are three selections found on the middle disc and they are \"Scarlet Begonias>Fire On The Mountain>Good Lovin\" and this is the meat of the show as Jerry, Bobby and Phil blaze throw 31 minute sequence like a house on fire. The drums are all chunk and thump throughout this and both Bob and Jerry are pumping their wah-wah pedals making noises that sound just like MIDI effects (that hadn't been invented yet!) and Bobby throws in some slide guitar and more wah and it is like nothing anybody else was creating in the seventies on any stage. My wife heard me listening to this and about 7 minutes into \"Fire\" she exclaimed: \"That Goat's Got Gas\" and I cracked-up as all the honking outta those two guitars did sound like goats on a rampage.\n\nDisc one is a standard 1st set with \"Big River\" and \"Passenger\" being the standouts with a bit of jamming in them to increase the X-Factor a bit higher. The tease before \"Me & My Uncle\" is only a few seconds long and I won't pop the balloon here and it shall remain a secret until you hear it.\n\nDisc three has a long \"Rhythm Devils\" at almost 14 minutes in length and \"Space\" is weird (as it should be) and that morphs into a layed-back \"Not Fade Away\" that is just like the 77 editions and then a very soulful \"Black Peter\" features Jerry in peak form as a singer and this version of Peter has a huge build up at the end that drops right into \"Around And Around\" that bookends the show with Chuck Berry (\"Promised Land\" opens set one) and it's a high-energy finish all the way.\n\n\"Werewolves Of London\" is the encore and it's a howl-fest and one of the band's best cover tunes ever performed.\n\nI Like this show and I hope more from 1978 does see the light of day as future releases.\nThree & 1\/2 Stars.","classification":4,"fold":4}

It harkens well back to the 1932 original from which this tune is built.\n\nThen that chugging, mid-pace beat comes in, with a subtly clubby keyboard riff, and it's somewhere highly accessible between the Cure and hip hop. And then you get that thin, old-timey vocal pushed througha Victrola speaker, faux mono, and I'm hearing echoes of Murray Head's \"One Night in Bangkok,\" even&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Aqualung-s\/dp\/B00000GAIW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Aqualung's<\/a>&nbsp;title track.\n\nAh, but to my listening the words are deeper than this AM pop veneer would lead you to believe.

Their previous album \"The Reason Why\" and their breakthrough \"The Road To Here\" remain my favorites. Wasn't a big fan of \"Pontoon\" when it was released earlier this year, but it is catchy and has grown on me. The stand out tracks on \"Tornado\" are \"Sober\", \"Your Side Of The Bed\", \"Can't Go Back\" and \"Night Owl\". The best thing about the album and Little Big Town are their harmonies.

Enter, Fergie, the seemingly sex-crazed double-entree singer who sung about her humps, and London Bridge, and a myriad of other metaphors. But this time, instead of doing that stuff, it's a breakup song, with acoustic guitar, and only the hint of a beat.\n\nThe lyrics aren't too bad, pretty simple, with hints of 'where did that come from?' Such as, \"We'll play jacks and uno cards.\" The verses are overall OK, nothing to brag about, and the vocals lack in some parts. However, the chorus comes out strong, and it and the acoustic guitar really make this a good song.\n\nSo overall, a good song, not a great one. A great change for Fergie, and definitely her best song by far, Black Eyed Peas or not. But in terms of getting this song, I wouldn't buy it, but I'd get it by other means if you know what I mean.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"I guess I finally have to own up to it; KD Lang has been making the same album for a few releases. You're getting everything you'll love about her, that gorgeous voice, the extremely tasteful arrangements and musicianship, the immaculate production. Touches of country (love that dobro) and Lang's chanteuse's ease with a lyrical lick. But you'll also miss what you really loved. \"Sing It Loud\" is dominated by songs that range from mid-tempo (\"Sorrow Nevermore\") to downright languid (\"A Sleep With No Dreaming\"). The more you listen, the more it becomes obvious that Lang has given up on music that has any kind of pep in its step. When you call your band Siss Boom Bang, you'd expect a little bang, maybe? Not this time.\n\nLang has still got the chops to take a song and just claim the thing as her own. While it mirrors the version done by Simply Red a couple decades ago, Lang's take on the Talking Heads' \"Heaven\" is masterful. She also nails the title track, but the point is that you're calling the album \"Sing It Loud.\" Is it too much to ask for a little volume, a little bit of kick? The same misrepresentation happens when you call a song \"Sugar Buzz.\" I'm not one to bemoan that she's no longer cutting \"Absolute Torch and Twang,\" but even \"Invincible Summer\" threw in a few pop thrills for a listener to grab hold of and for Lang to sink her teeth into. \"Sing It Loud\" is a joyless, tepid affair that you've heard too many times before.","classification":3,"fold":4}

All in all it's a decent album but doesn't top Blessing in Disguise as my all-time favorite. Maybe if I'd have gotten the albums just prior to Howe's return I'd have a little more appreciation for this one.\n\nEDIT: I went back and purchased the previous 4 albums with Ronnie Monroe on vocals, and after listenening to them a few times chronologically, I felt I needed to revisit this review.

I don't remember them being this accessible before.\n\nBased on some blogs and noticing that Greg Kurstin helped work on this project, I got the full album.  Greg Kurstin did some of my favorite tracks on Kylie Minogue's X album and has produced some hot jams through the years from the likes of P!nk, Little Boots, Britney Spears, Kesha and such and I'm really looking forward to his work on the new Dido album coming out.\n\nAnyway, so glad I got this album.

{"text":"\"Smoke on the Water,\" originally from the great Deep Purple album \"Machine Head,\" has one of the most iconic riffs in all of rock courtesy of Ritchie Blackmore and his Strat. This somewhat extended version, recorded live in Japan, has, if anything, even more energy than the original. Easily the most recognizable and popular song from Deep Purple's catalogue, the song chronicles an actual event. In December 1971 Deep Purple was in Montreux, Switzerland to record an album at the Montreux Casino next to Lake Geneva using mobile recording equipment owned by the Rolling Stones. During a Frank Zappa concert on December 4, a fan set off a flare gun, setting the ceiling on fire and burning the complex to the ground. The flames and smoke drifted over the lake, while the members of Deep Purple watched. The band then had to scramble for a venue to record \"Machine Head\" in, and finally settled on the Montreux Grand Hotel. The song is quite an accurate piece of history, and definitely one of the heaviest, most listenable pieces of musical history ever recorded.\n\nThe song has appeared in various versions (the most amusing is from Pat Boone's \"In a Metal Mood,\" with Blackmore reprising his role on guitar) on many albums. I love live music, and highly endorse this version, and I also recommend \"Machine Head\" (the \"Best Hits\" album is also a good buy at a reasonable price.) One thing's certain, though: no musical library should be without this staple.","classification":5,"fold":4}

While most convert albums suffer a bit from the \"noise\" of the crowd's cheers, in this case they actually add to the experience rather than distracting.\n\nDiscovery was a sweet box of evolving melodies, but this is a driving, thrumming, buzzing beat box of awesome! I always loved how the melodies of Discovery melded into each other, making you want to listen to the entire album. This is a series of Daft Punk's best songs mixed together perfectly with enough wonderous glorious bass to benchmark any speaker system.\n\nIf I have a single complaint, it's the that the Close Encounters of the Third Kind opening is missing from the audio recording, and should be included. Other than that, listen to this and enjoy. It's awesome music for just listening, but it's REALLY great for exercise, doing chores, or (obviously) having a dance party. Highly, HIGHLY recommended.\n\nFinal note: If you have a record player the complete Alive Boxed Set is totally worth it as it includes a backstage pass, stickers, bonus tracks, a turntable pad, and a gorgeous art book.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"At a few seconds short of forty one minutes this album is almost a tease. On the other hand it's both historic and great music. The historic aspect is this is the first of four collaborations between Peterson and Jackson and it presages the ones to come.\n\nListen to the sound samples on this page and even those short snippets will reveal the magic of this album. I am not going to try to dissect the music or impose my personal taste on you, but if you love swinging and tight quartets with a piano and vibraphone in front you will be more than pleased with this album.\n\nWhile I promised to not dissect the music I will say that the intensity that Jackson brings to the performances match the backing trio - Peterson and bassist Ray Brown in particular were renown for intensity even on ballads, and drummer Ed Thigpen fit right into that as well. So the chemistry among the four is natural and one of the reasons why this album appeals to me.\n\nThe album was recorded for Verve in NYC over the course of two sessions (September 15 and 18, 1961.)  Sadly there were five unissued tracks from the sessions, two of which are logged as 'untitled Peterson originals' that I would have loved to have been included in a reissue. Regardless, the music that is on this album is definitely worthwhile.","classification":5,"fold":4}

It has been Jon's experience since his excellent \"Pleasures U Like\" that without proper promotion, everyone suffers. That album had been led by the Top 3 success of \"Don't Talk\" which should have insured a long term promotion commitment. That didn't happen. One key Epic\/Sony executive, Polly Anthony, held the reigns to its destiny. Frustrated, Jon decided to jump ship and head to Dreamworks. As luck would have it, that Epic\/Sony executive would also turn up at the boutique label. This caused a shift in strategy. Therefore, he took, what was then called \"Everyday Struggles\" to Sanctuary Urban. That album, now transformed into \"Stronger Everyday\" was loaded with a number of hit singles. Sanctuary Urban would have its own share of problems effectively leading to a poor promotion job. For his next release, \"Helpless Romantic\", he decided to go the full indie route with the enabling mechanism designed for solid promotion. The strength of that album was reflected in Universal Fontana's ability to garner AirPlay. Now he was at the mercy of indie promotion. But at least, he had a degree of control over its destiny.\n.\"Comfortable Swagg\" comes on his Vibezelect label, a word\/concept first exposed on, \"Pleasures U Like\".\n\nThis time around, Jon has gone more uptempo than he has ever been. It sorta has a Euro-soul\/dance feel to it. You might be hard press to identify it as Jon B. if you hear an isolated track. That is a bit refreshing. Whilst \"Helpless Romantic\" was indeed more romantic leaning with ballads and mid tempo grooves. On \"Comfortable Swag\", he has taken to the dance floor. It signals that Jon may be in a most different place than he has ever been.\n\n\"Comfortable Swagg\" also spawned two excellent singles and videos for the title track and \"Only One\". \"Only One\" may be one of his finest music videos. It is very simple but effective. There has been more on line promotion for this album than all of the promotion for the life of \"Helpless Romantic\". Jon has also been touring more on this album than he had for the entire life of his previous release. So though this album is not quite as strong as his best to date of \"Cool Relax\" and \"Stronger Everyday\", \"Comfortable Swagg\" has enough solid material that it should ultimately \"Triumph\"!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I remember being little, maybe 6 or 7ish when this song came out on the radio in the early 80s (the band was formed in 1981). I also remember hearing it for the first time at my older friends birthday party on the new boom box that he had just received as a gift. I still remember this moment as one of the coolest experiences and moments in my life. I mean in the early 80s run dmc was IT!! I love all of their stuff especially the super iconic \"walk this way\" with the band Aerosmith. If history and memory serve me, I believe that this was the first collaborative project between a quintessentially rock n roll band and a hip-hop, rap group. I never knew back then that I would be making music history for now. I feel honored and privileged that God let me be there and experience it first hand. as for run DMC, it was made up of three influential rappers, performers from Hollis Queens, NY. these members were Joseph \"Run\" Simmons, (yes, younger brother of the famous promoter, business mogul, Russell Simmons), Darryl \"D.M.C.\" McDaniels and Jason \"Jam Master Jay\" Mizell (who is now deceased). little did they know growing up in Hollis that they would be hip-hop and music pioneers. they were the first hip-hop group to do many things that previous groups, hip-hop or not, were not privileged enough to do. they were the first to have videos on MTV, the first hip-hop group to be on the cover of rolling stone magazine, the first to have a hip-hop album go gold and the first to be nominated for a music grammy award and the list goes on and on. my favorite was their appearance on the show \"american bandstand\" hosted by the legendary dick clark. I know because i never missed an episode:) lastly, their tremendous influence on music and pop culture was cemented in 2009 when they were inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame. (the only other rap group to do so was Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.) personally, i can't give enough accolades to the group. I just know that they surely don't make music groups like this anymore. with \"its tricky\" I was able to enjoy the \"fresh\" ride back to the early 80s when rap was new and genuine- no fakes here!! it was nothing but good memories, I say!! I wish I could bring them all back! purchase a sample of music history and enjoy!!!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Pieced together from unreleased recordings made during the making of their 1994 studio album \"The Division Bell\", the best way to describe Pink Floyd's surprise 15th, and supposedly final studio album \"The Endless River\" (which is also their first album in 20 years), is as an instrumental, 53-minute prog-rock suite in four movements, with one song at the end. The album is mostly instrumental save for the last track, \"Louder Than Words\", with lead vocals by guitarist David Gilmour. It is a continuous ambient flow, or river, of Pink Floyd music, apparently the last we will ever get from Gilmour, drummer Nick Mason, and their late great keyboardist Richard Wright, to whom the album is dedicated to. Already proven to be a polarizing album amongst the fans, The Endless River is for the diehard Floyd fan who loves the band's instrumental works of the past, and just wants to hear a solid Pink Floyd album to kick back with as the band entrance you with their expert instrumental workouts. The music is very powerful, with Gilmour, Mason and Wright firing on all cylinders with brilliant musicianship throughout. The album's music may come in instrumental \"bits\", but the bits have been pieced together so expertly, that, as a whole, it forms a powerful, cohesive album, a marvelous Pink Floyd tapestry that just washes over you. The final track on The Endless River is the only actual song, \"Louder Than Words\", a lovely tune with lyrics by Polly Samson, that sums up the band's history quite well, sung straight from the heart by Gilmour. I started out giving \"The Endless River\" 4 out of 5 stars, but this unique Floyd album really is a \"grower\". The more I listen to it, the more I love it. It really is a very special Pink Floyd album, and I now award it the full 5 out of 5 stars. \"The Endless River\" is not your typical Floyd album, and it's ambient instrumental nature is not for everybody. It doesn't dethrone the classic Floyd albums of the past, and sure, a few more songs with lyrics would've been nice. But as it is, \"The Endless River\" is still a very powerful, most enjoyable Pink Floyd album that, as far as I'm concerned, closes the book on this amazing band on a very high note indeed. It's a wonderful parting gift from the Floyd to their fans, and I so greatly appreciate it. Thank you David, Nick, and Rick. AND Roger and Syd too. Long live the mighty Pink Floyd.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"This is actually the first Trivium album I got, a little over two years ago. Since then, I've listened to this album countless times. In fact, the first time I listened to it was all the way through, it was so good and able to keep my interest throughout. Although Trivium's first two albums are more associated with the metalcore sound, \"The Crusade\" takes them into a pure thrash-metal direction. Blistering guitar solos, bludgeoning riffs, breakneck drumming, meter-pushing tempos, skilled songwriting and aggressive vocals dominate the album throughout; however, I would also like to point out that there are indeed some very beautiful melodic sections and larger-than-life sounding elements incorporated, making this more than just another thrash album.\n\nI could end right there and just tell you to go out and get the album already, but that would be an injustice on my part. \"The Crusade\" is one of the best metal albums of this decade in my opinion, and let me explain in the rest of my review.\n\nWe kick off with \"Ignition\", a fast and angry song about the corruption of the government and its pointless obsession with the horrors of war and violence. Going from a speed-metal verse to a softer, more mournful sounding chorus, this song has a nice contrast to it. The ending guitar drone then brings us into \"Detonation\", which, by the the title alone, is a sequel to the first song. This song has one of the most intense sections on the entire album, with some insane guitar soloing over some of the most brutal double-bass drumming, almost taking the band to a death metal sort of sound, but not quite. A sad and yet gorgeous second half of the song rings out with slower verses and huge-sounding guitar sweeps, making yet another nice contrast in sounds.\n\n\"Entrance of the Conflagration\" is a moshpit-ready headbanger with some catchy-as-ever riffs, a complex mid-section and more great solos; this is one of my favorite songs on the album. \"Anthem (We Are The Fire)\" is right up there, too, with uplifting lyrics, amazing guitar solos and a shout-a-long chant after the solo section. This is truly an anthem! Even though it has just as much energy as the previous song, \"Unrepentant\" brings us back to the darker side, with lyrics about a true-life crime, just as in \"Entrace of the Conflagration\", the same which can be said for the next song, \"And Sadness Will Sear\".\n\nTaking things to a more fantasy-based nature, \"Becoming The Dragon\" combines more huge-sounding melodies with pure thrash-metal energy and a generally good vibe. Galloping riffs and some frantic solos are featured, along with, surprisingly, a bass solo! Paolo lets his bass ring out some interesting notes and phrases as the song fades out on a slow and interesting note. \"To The Rats\" is another truly awesome, three-and-a-half minute burst of energy, this one also almost treading into death-metal territory with its breakneck speed. However, a cool change is thrown in with the shout-a-long chorus, slowed down for good measures. \"This World Can't Tear Us Apart\" is a beautiful slow-dance styled song with some great melodies and sometimes-straightforward, sometimes-enigmatic lyrics. This song offers a nice change of pace, and is done in just three-and-a-half minutes.\n\n\"Tread The Floods\" has a sick intro with a great buildup until the chorus, which is one of the most empowering and catchiest choruses on the entire album, and the way it's sung at the end of the song ends it perfectly. \"Contempt Breeds Contamination\" is the fourth song based on a true-life crime, and this is another song that utilizes the low B-string, making it a heavy number indeed. The soloing also adds to the power, this time being spread out instead of one solo after another such as in \"Anthem (We Are The Fire\").\n\n\"The Rising\" seems to be a rather underrated song, although it's honestly just as good as any other song on the album. A slower, more majestic pace is featured here in addition to another great shout-a-long chorus. Finally, the album ends with the eight-and-a-half minute instrumental epic title track, \"The Crusade\". An awesome way to end the album and a great song just in general, you can tell the band put a lot of effort into writing this instrumental masterpiece.\n\nComparatively, \"The Crusade\" is indeed, different from \"Ascendancy\", going in a thrash-metal direction and having more three-and-a-half minute songs for the most part, instead of the generally longer songs on \"Ascendancy\". Even though the two albums are different, \"The Crusade\" comes highly recommended to Trivium fans, as it shows the band at the top of their game and maturing as musicians and songwriters. Well, that about wraps up this review. In short, \"The Crusade\" is an album that keeps metal alive today, regardless of the scene. Get this and Trivium's newest album \"Shogun\" if you don't have that already, and I guarantee you'll be happy. Thanks for the time, and peace.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Ludacris has been a major player in the rap game for 10 years now. From day one we knew he had the potential to be one of the top rappers in the game and he has fulfilled that promise. Each album has had a different concept since \"Release Therapy\". I like how he has managed to stay on topic with all his albums. So when I found out he was teaming with fellow DTP member Shawnna for \"Battle Of The Sexes\" I knew to expect an album about male vs female issues, with some sex themed tracks and some radio friendly songs. But then Shawnna dropped out and \"Theater Of The Mind 2\" wasn't ready.  So they went ahead and released \"Battle Of The Sexes\" anyway as a solo Ludacris album.\n\n\"Battle Of The Sexes\" is exactly what I thought it would be. You have the male vs female issue on \"Hey Ho\", the sex themed \"Sex Room\" ft. Trey Songz  & the radio friendly \"How Low\". Since Shawnna jumped ship, Ludacris has enlisted some of the top female rappers in the game like Lil' Kim, Nicki Minaj, Trina & Eve. Shawnna  appears on the standout track \"B.O.T.S. Radio\".  \"Party No Mo\" ft Gucci Mane is solid. Especially since Gucci is not rapping and only doing the hook. \"Tell Me A Secret\" ft Ne-Yo is a love song for the ladies. And the Intro is banging.  But all is not good with \"Battle Of The Sexes\".  The Shawnna duet \"Feelin' So Sexy\" is not that good to me. And I don't know what he was thinking with the childish \"Sextin\". (Even though I can see him releasing this song as a single with a hilarious video)\n\nThis album has been talked about since before the first Disturbing Tha Peace release but was delayed to build up Shawnna's solo career.  Now \"Battle Of The Sexes\" has finally seen the light of day and I think it would have been better as a collaboration album. But Luda has to be commended on his ability to adjust. His lyrics aren't as sharp as before. But once you remember that this was supposed to be a collaboration album you can begin to overlook that flaw. He manages to stay on track with the overall theme. Luda fans may be disappointed. Though not as good as \"Theater Of The Mind\", it should hopefully keep fans in place until \"Theater Of The Mind 2\" drops.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"After the unprecedented success of \"Hanging By A Moment,\" Lifehouse took the genre they inevitably bore and ran with it. The result is a follow-up forever foreshadowed by the success of its predecessor, but arguably tops it. Taking a heavy-dose from the grunge genre, Lifehouse all but nixes any acoustic or poppy elements from their sound, as it all takes a very raw, rough, but rockin' turn instead. I personally love every moment of it, as it's on the edge, and it's almost one long consistent jam session that the band really ran and had fun with.\n\nStandout tracks include \"Spin,\" \"Sky Is Falling,\" \"Stanley Climbfall,\" and the highlight\/album-definer \"Take Me Away.\"\n\nOverall, on a recent list I made of the top 15 albums in Christian music, I placed this particular work at #9, saying \"If 'No Name Face' bore modern rock as we know it, then \"Stanley Climbfall\" perfected it. It's still one of the most consistent records I've ever heard.\" Well, that pretty much sums it up. It's highly controversial, especially since this album has been largely forgotten, but it is a true masterpiece in the genre of modern rock. Sure, 'No Name Face' has the moving work of \"Everything,\" but 'Stanley Climbfall' has the consistency and the driving \"Take Me Away.\" I still am however confused about the title.

{"text":"I would never have imagined that anyone could cover this beautiful song and make me like it as much as the original Simon & Garfunkle version. I stumbled on this Disturbed remake just flipping through the channels on Sirius radio the other day and I was simply mesmerized. I had never heard of Disturbed before, but the singer's deep, rich baritone sort of forces the already intense and timeless lyrics under your skin. He forces you to stop and listen and just focus. And wasn't that always what the message was?","classification":5,"fold":4}
{"text":"Metallica's second album, and their first for a major record label Elektra, entitled Ride the Lightning is also arguably their best album ever.\nFirst released in August of 1984, Ride the Lightning was considered a metal masterpiece in the underground at the time of its release.\nAfter the promising debut album Kill 'em All in 1983, Metallica (which was comprised of singer\/guitarist James Hetfield, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, drummer Lars Ulrich and the late great bass player Cliff Burton), the band's cult following got them a major record deal with Elektra Records and the band went to Denmark with the band themselves producing and using one-time Rainbow engineer Flemming Rasmussen to help record their now classic major label debut which I found to be the case when I first got this album in May of 1989 on cassette.\nThe album starts off with \"Fight Fire With Fire\" which at first sounded like it was going to be a ballad with acoustic guitars and clean electric guitars playing a relaxing melody but then Hammett and Hetfield's guitars come screaming in as was Ulrich's drumming which sounded like Bruce Lee on speed and Burton's bass playing which was superb. James' vocals on the track sounded sinister. We continue the rocking on the album's classic title cut which is a classic thrashy cut with tempo changes that would make the prog rockers happy. Next is another classic metal track \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" which is a superb rocker with a beat that sounds like marching off to war. The first half ends with \"Fade to Black\" which for the most part was a ballad before speeding up and was IMHO the Stairway to Heaven of the 80s as, like that song, starts soft then picks up then softens then gets harder and harder before the big finale.\nThe album's second half kicks off with a classic thrash number called \"Trapped Under Ice\" which is just superb. Next is another great metal number \"Escape\". However, it's a shame that these two great songs are overlooked by many. We then come to one of Metallica's best pre-1991 masterworks \"Creeping Death\" which would remain a concert favorite and rightfully so cos this song is amazing. We end the album with the epic instrumental called \"The Call of Ktulu\" which sounds like the band had been listening to ELP, Genesis, Pink Floyd and Yes as the piece is filled with tempo changes, key changes and is just stellar, especially Hammett and Burton's solos on guitar and wah-wah bass respectively.\nWhile Ride the Lightning scraped the Top 100 upon its release without either radio or MTV or even mainstream media support, the album today is now their third largest selling album with some five million copies sold in the US alone today.\nMost Metallica fans from 1991 onward probably don't like this album but us purists who liked their speed metal sound in their early days then this album is for you.\nHighly recommended!","classification":5,"fold":4}
{"text":"\"Tiny purple fishes run laughing through your fingers...\" Yeah, OK...Martin Sharp. He wrote the lyrics, Eric Clapton wrote the music. The song is from the psychedelic blues rock masterpiece, Disraeli Gears. Sharp also did the cover art for this album. He was also really interested in Tiny Tim.(?!) How come I never knew any of this stuff !!! I always just liked the song and only found out about Martin Sharp just now.\n\nStrange Brew, World of Pain, Sunshine of your Love, all great tunes, but this is my favorite Cream song. It has some great wah wah pedal and heavy rock 7th chords, murky feel to it, Jack Bruce spewing these stream of consciousness words. Really, those lyrics! 'His naked ears were tortured'...I figured since Ulysses (Odysseus for all you Romans out there) was a guy I'd read about in school, then this meant something to me.

{"text":"At least it starts with three of the best tracks, led by the excellent 'Anyhow'. For me the idea to give everyone in this band a spot has become a problem. Hence we get the dreadful 'Right on Time' (once is enough) and 'Crying over You' which at least is rescued briefly by a fiery guitar break before flute kicks in! Susan thrives throughout as ever, but you feel again that on record Derek has seconded himself to the overall sound of this band. Just watch him go on any live gig! 'Keep on Growing' and 'I Pity the Fool' live, on the deluxe edition show everyone at their best. A live band for sure. On this album everything comes together though in the fine conclusion 'In Every Heart'.","classification":4,"fold":4}

However, I feel like Deftones went TOO experimental on this record and it comes off as kinda tame at points. When I first got into Deftones they were a relatively-heavy metal band with nice guitar riffs on albums like \"Adrenaline\" and \"Around The Fur\". Which are both great albums, but when the band got more popular they started to die down on their heaviness and go with a cleaner more friendly sound as each record went on. Quite personally, this record is too mellow for me. I like Deftones when they're angry and jamming through the tracks. Not this atomspheric soothing psychedelia. If you're expecting another Koi No Yokan, then this record is for you. If you're expecting a more harder album, then it's passable.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"It's surprising how many classic Christmas LPs have never been re-mastered for conversion to CD, none more so than Christmas Carols by Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra which first came out in 1958 as mono Dot 3148 containing: White Christmas; It Came Upon A Midnight Clear; O Holy Night; Deck The Halls; The First Noel; Joy To The World; Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful); Silent Night; God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen; O Tannenbaum (O Christmas Tree); Hark! The Herald Angels Sing; Faith Of Our Fathers; Jingle Bells; O Little Town Of Bethlehem.\n\nOver the years with subsequent reissues there were 3 different covers with the original having a mostly yellow cover and a stylized drawing of a sleigh inside a large red oval (which made it a bit odd in that Sleigh Ride itself was not among the tracks). In 1959 the same album came out in stereo (Dot 3148\/25148), with a glossy front cover, \"Billy Vaughn\" in white on a green background and gold-embossed \"Christmas Carols\" on red, with a gold embossed border. When re-issued again a few years later the cover was a flat red, the \"Dot\" logo in its usual 3 colors situated in a green circle, \"Billy Vaughn\" in white and \"Christmas Carols\" in yellow. Charting-wise it made it to # 145 on Billboard's Christmas charts in 1962 and # 101 in 1967.\n\nSome of the tracks have appeared on these CDs: Christmas With Billy Vaughn & His Yuletide Orchestra - 9 of the same tracks in a 10-track 2006 release that includes Auld Lang Syne; Christmas Classics, a 1996 release from Chicago Music Company that contains the same 10 sides; and Christmas Song, a 2012 release from Essential Media Group containing the same line-up. None of these include God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen or White Christmas, nor can I say with any certainty that they are all the same original 1958 renditions.\n\nWhy that has never been re-mastered for CD is a puzzle since Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra wasn't just some run-of-the-mill band back then. After being part of the highly-successful Dot vocal quartet known as The Hilltoppers, who had 15 hit singles for the label from 1952 to 1954, he left to form the in-house Dot orchestra in 1954 that would go on to back the vast majority of Dot artists on so many hit singles and albums (e.g. Pat Boone, Gail Storm, The Fontane Sisters, Tab Hunter, Nick Todd (Pat Boone's brother), and many more for years to come.\n\nIn the midst of all that, he and his orchestra would rack up some 31 hit singles of their own from their first, Melody Of Love in late 1954\/early 1955, to their last in 1967, I Love You (And You Love Me), while selling albums in the millions, 4 of which went Gold: The Golden Instrumentals (1956); Sail Along Silv'ry Moon (1958); Blue Hawaii (1959); and Theme From A Summer Place (1960).\n\nA great deal of his music is available on CD, so why are they dragging their heels with his premier Christmas album?","classification":5,"fold":4}

Sam Smith does an excellent job and if you haven't heard it, you are missing out.  The lyrics listed below and apply to many circumstances.  Love, Love, Love it.\n\nLay Me Down\n\nBy Sam Smith\n\nYes I do, I believe\nThat one day I will be, where I was\nRight there, right next to you\nAnd it's hard, the days just seem so dark\nThe moon, and the stars, are nothing without you\nYour touch, your skin, where do I begin?\nNo words can explain, the way I'm missing you\nThe night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside\nThese tears, they tell their own story\n\nYou told me not to cry when you were gone\nBut the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong\nCan I lay by your side, next to you, you\nAnd make sure you're alright\nI'll take care of you\nAnd I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight\n\nI'm reaching out to you\nCan you hear my call? (Who's to say you won't hear me?)\nThis hurt that I've been through\nI'm missing you, missing you like crazy\n\nYou told me not to cry when you were gone\nBut the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong\nCan I lay by your side, next to you, you\nAnd make sure you're alright\nI'll take care of you\nAnd I don't wanna be here if I can't be with you tonight\n\nLay me down tonight, lay me by your side\nLay me down tonight, lay me by your side\nCan I lay by your side, next to you, you","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Making a comeback after having a musical experience most would envy in the 60's would've been unthinkable for most bands and performers. The Dead did this the previous year with the more somber jazz and folk inflected&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Wake-of-the-Flood\/dp\/B000E1ZBEU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wake of the Flood<\/a>.The little whiff of soul and that touch of funk really began to find it's own here as the band beefed up their sound again and really rode with high energy every step of the way. The main reason here is more of an emphasis on uptempo tunes.\"U.S. Blues\" is a scorcher and as great a way to open an album as I can think-nice bluesy rocker for them.\"Unbroken Chain\" is truly one of the most musically interesting pieces here-fooling you into thinking your in for a mellow folky tune again until these fairy tale firework sounding synthesizers seem to fall from the sky onto the song and the whole thing builds into this burning latin-rock type jam.\"Loose Lucy\" is,as far as this album is concerned the most outright funky thing on it. It's funny how when some rock musicians go for funk it ends up sounding more like dressed up blues but in this case it goes out the box into....something kind of all it's own. The festive \"Scarlet Bigonias\" is a song a lot of people come into this album for and it deserves it:the great festive rhythms and Jimmy Buffet\/island rock flavor oozes out of every corner. In keeping with the way the Dead entered into the 70's they give us the upbeat country rocker \"Pride Of Cucamonga\".Yes so it's very twangy but it all sounds so good everything on it really works.\"Money Money\" is a really hard rocker and the tale of a cash craving lady is also augmented by clever little melodic referrences to Barret Strongs similarly titled Motown classic. The softer parts of the album come by way of the organ led \"China Doll\" and the story and the poetic \"Ship Of Fools\" to close everyting out. You also get 7 bonus cuts here,all either live or outtake versions of songs from this album or close to the period. Nonetheless this is definately a high water mark for the Dead in the 70's and really baught back lots of energy into their music and general flavors.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor, infamous for long delays between albums, sure has been productive lately. 2007 saw Reznor release the critically acclaimed \"Year Zero\" and its' follow-up \"Year Zero Remixed.\" In addition, last year Reznor produced Saul Williams' \"The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of Niggy Tardust.\" Now, out of nowhere, with no advance notice, Reznor is back with NIN's sixth album, the instrumental \"Ghosts I-IV.\"\n\n\"A soundtrack for daydreams,\" is how Reznor sums up the new album...and that, I feel, is the best way to appreciate the new NIN. Rather than listening to this album as background music while driving or doing housework, \"Ghosts I-IV\" is best appreciated with relaxed, yet concentrated listening. Lie in bed or on the sofa, relaxed, and immerse yourself with this CD. Just sort of daydream--meditate, think about whatever...and let \"Ghosts I-IV\" be the soundtrack...\n\nAnd as the mood of the album changes, allow your mood to flow with the album...try to get lost in the music.\n\nSome have commented that \"Ghosts I-IV\" sounds similar in style to the instrumental music from \"The Fragile,\" (1999) but I don't know if it's all that accurate to say that. While the instrumental music from \"the Fragile\" sort of held the vocal compositions from that CD together like glue, \"Ghosts I-IV\" is a little more \"out there.\" It can, therefore, be seen as a mosaic--of several different styles--piano compositions, industrial beats, the avant-garde--all mixed together, with no real dominant flavor overpowering the rest. And while the album is all-over-the-place, treading many territories, everything works; \"Ghosts I-IV\" takes so many twists-and-turns-its always interesting. At the same time, with almost two hours of music to absorb, \"Ghosts I-IV\" is best appreciated with repeated listens--to fully appreciate all its' rich textures and intricacy.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"For an artist of her stature, Rosanne Cash has been the subject of surprisingly thin compilation releases. Several 10- and 12-track single disc collections have been issued, but only Raven's imported 21-track&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Blue-Moons-and-Broken-Hearts\/dp\/B0009VI5P2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Blue Moons and Broken Hearts<\/a>&nbsp;and to a lesser extent Legacy's earlier&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Very-Best-Of\/dp\/B000BKDNXA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Very Best Of<\/a>&nbsp;really dug beyond the hits. That list is now expanded with this two-disc, thirty-six track collection, featuring a song list picked and programmed by the artist herself. The set opens with \"Can I Still Believe in You,\" from her 1978 self-titled Germany-only debut, and closes over thirty years later with a trio of tracks drawn from 2009's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-List\/dp\/B0029LHW5E\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The List<\/a>. The latter selections include a cover of Mickey Newbury's \"Sweet Memories\" previously available only on the Borders Books version of The List.\n\nIncluded are all eleven of Cash's country chart-toppers, seventeen of her twenty country chart entries, and tracks drawn from all twelve studio albums she's recorded for Ariola, Columbia and Capitol\/EMI. There are augumented with bonuses drawn from earlier antholgies, and duets from albums by Vince Gill (\"If It Weren't For Him\") and Rodney Crowell (\"Its Such a Small World\"). The bulk of the collection is devoted to Cash's tenure with Columbia, with the second half of disc two stepping through her more recent work for Capitol\/EMI. These latter tracks find Cash reinventing herself from a country hit maker to a writer, album auteur and Grammy nominee. This plays out as a worthy soundtrack for Cash's recent memoir,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Composed\/dp\/0670021962\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Composed<\/a>, provides a terrific overview of her hits and a useful guide to the rich album tracks in her catalog.\n\nThough Cash isn't prone to complimenting her debut, the strength of her songwriter's voice is evident from the start. It may be difficult at mid-life to fully reconnect with the yet-to-be-fulfilled longing one felt at twenty-three, but the early songs provide telling snapshots of a young writer who was already able to express her soul in words. A year later, on 1979's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Right-or-Wrong\/dp\/B00005QK4Z\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Right or Wrong<\/a>, Cash sounds more confident, singing as an equal with Bobby Bare on \"No Memories Hangin' Round,\" and producer Rodney Crowell deftly blended roots with radio-friendly touches. Her follow-up,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Seven-Year-Ache\/dp\/B00005QK4Z\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Seven Year Ache<\/a>, broke her career wide open with an album and title track that each topped the country chart; the single also crossed over, stopping just shy of the pop top twenty.\n\nCash's songs and vocals, and Crowell's production fit easily across a variety of styles, including pop ballads, twangy roots, countrypolitan jazz, and horn-lined soul. Several of the hits, particularly those in the mid-80s, tended to crystalline guitars, big piano and booming drums, but Cash also topped the chart with the locomotive rhythm of \"My Baby Thinks He's a Train,\" the Brill Building soul of John Hiatt's \"The Way We Make a Broken Heart,\" and most endearingly, an acoustic shuffle of \"Tennessee Flat Top Box\" that recalled her dad's early days at Sun.\n\nCash's introductory notes provide a peek inside the discoveries that occur when an artist anthologizes her own catalog - thinking back to the places and people that influenced one's work, and wondering who they were when a particular song was written or performed. It's hard to tell if the songs provide mileage markers for her life, or her life provides the events that demarcate the phases of her career; a bit of each, it seems. The set's affectionate and perceptive liner notes are written by Rodney Crowell, to whom Cash was married and who produced her first five albums. The booklet adds detailed session notes, including chart information and personnel, and fleshes out this terrific overview of a second-generation country legend.

{"text":"So people bash this album, same way they've done with the last 3 albums. Minutes to Midnight saw a band taking a turn for experimental music. A Thousand Suns saw the band mix in Electronica and other genres into one. Living Things saw once again the experiments indulge our ears.\n\nI personally did not like Living Things, it was completely short and aside from a pair of songs, the rest of the album was unlistenable. They promised a \"Rock record\" and they released it. So why the hate? Do people prefer the electronica based albums of the last two albums or do they prefer an album that sounds like when they began? I don't get fans!\n\nThis is the album I believe I hear more of their guitarist for the first time since Minutes to Midnight. He was almost non-existent in the last two albums. From top to bottom, I believe it is a great record. By any stretch is it better than their debut or their follow up but this album shows that Linkin Park has not forgotten their rock roots. It may not be Metal but tracks like: Wastelands, War, Guilty All The Same & Mark The Graves have that feel like before.\n\nI think fans will be divided on this again since people think LP will go back to making records like Hybrid Theory, bury that thought cause it ain't happening. The Hunting Party is an excellent turn for the better for LP and I think people should be reminded that they are almost in their 40's, they can't keep on screaming and jumping like if it was 2001.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Jewel continues to exist in that very small sector of recording artists who manage to musically better themselves with each new release.  Dispensing with the folk\/pop\/country undertones that often distinguish her music, but still lyrically on the same page, 0304 finds the singer beckoning us to the dancefloor.  Granted, this isn't the out-and-out club record that some seem to be mistaking it for--it's not even nearly as cutting edge as the forward-thinking remixes of 'Serve The Ego' that she so effortlessly breezed through.  But, it is different enough from her previous work to seemingly brandish her a \"sell-out\"(other\nnew members of this club include indie-goddess turned power popster Liz Phair, but that's for another review).  Which is too bad, because this is indeed Jewel's best album--in fact, it's probably the best album Madonna DIDN'T make(and boy, she REALLY didn't make it with that folk-styled drink coaster otherwise known as AMERICAN LIFE).  First single 'Intuition' hints at things to come throughout the set, with a helping hand from Shakira producer Lester Mendez.  'Stand', 'Fragile Heart' and the future club smash 'Run 2 U' all bounce along with enough addictive melodies to forgive the singer for her still overwrought lyrical approach.  And even if she falters somewhat by placing identical-sounding songs in slots ten through thirteen, it overall remains a more than solid musical treat.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"These songs were recorded by Waylon mainly with just an acoustic guitar and bass, after his death, good friend Turner brought in Reggie Young and Waylon's band and finished the tracks. Jessi Colter didn't want to make these available right away as it would look like they were just cashing in on Waylon's death, maybe so, but as a fan, I would have liked to got these in 2002, not a full Decade later! I mean come on!\nWaylon's voice is stromng but they sound \"airy\" as if they were recorded in a open room with just an open mic, which was true. But they did a good job producing these songs as best they could to give them a professional sound to them as if they were actual studio session recodings as per making a new album. The material is very enjoyable and Waylon penned most of these song himself! This is for sure a MUST OWN for any Waylon fan! In a age where most new CD's of Waylon are rip off's and same old material just repackaged, here's a legit new release of ORIGINAL Material! Along with 2007 \"Walyon Forever\" which was produced by his son Shooter, thats all there has been released for new Studio material.","classification":5,"fold":4}

She was trying to get my mind off of what had happened a few days before when Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\" came on.\n\nBefore I even had time to think about it, we looked at each other and started \"car dancing\", you know, you're bustin' a move while moving at a high rate of speed, singing at the top of your lungs, laughing, crying and just having fun.  People driving past us would look over and smile, or laugh, some even paced themselves alongside us and broke out in their own car dancing moves.\n\nI didn't stop and think about what people would think if they knew my husband had just died.  I didn't stop and think about anything except the moment me and my best friend were in, \"Girl's just having fun\".\n\nThe lyrics are easy to pick up, sing along with and dance to and the video was great.\n\nI believe that if more girls just wanted to have that sort of carefree silly fun, the world might be a little less uptight.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Emmylou Harris has a voice unlike no other.  I don't even think that is open to debate.  Like it or hate it, she sings like no one else and it has been this way for what, 35-40 years?  Personally, I love her voice.\n\nNormally, I like Harris as a music interpreter as opposed to doing her own material, but now and again she shines in this aspect.  With 'Hard Bargain', she succeeds and fails depending on the track.  While it has gotten stellar reviews, I find it a bit uneven myself.\n\nThere are great great songs, like \"The Road\" (a tribute to her mentor, Gram Parsons), the gritty and fun \"Six White Cadillacs\" (though the iTune video version is even better!), the title track, \"Goodnight Old World\" and \"Cross Yourself\".\n\nI know I should like \"Darlin' Kate\", but it is just ok. Same with \"My Name is Emmett Till\".  But I find them to be just fair and I'm left wanting more.  I'm all for Harris' dog rescue program, but \"Big Black Dog\" just does not fit here.\n\nI am impressed that the disk is just Harris and two other musicians.  I think that takes great talent to do this.  I might have liked to hear Anna McGarrigale's backing vocals, but Harris took those out and sang her own harmonies.  Still, it sounds good.\n\nHarris has done more with her own work ('Stumble into Grace', 'Red Dirt Girl'), so I expected and wanted more from this disk.  Don't get me wrong, it's good - better than most anything released this year, but I still expected and wanted better.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"I fell in love with J-Hud's voice while she was a contestant on American Idol.  She along with Fantasia & Latoya London made up the so-called \"Three Divas\" - they are all talented young women and of the three I felt that Jen was the most talented BUT that Fantasia had an undeniable \"it\" factor while in comparison Jen needed more seasoning as a performer.  It sure would've been fun to see a Fantasia vs J-Hud finale but it's water under the bridge at this point since both a living their dreams now.\n\nI've had to sit with this album for a while and give the songs a chance to \"marinate\" before giving my opinion.  As debuts go I think it's ok - the problem for Jen is that fans have heard her and gotten to fall in love with her voice before this album was released and were expecting magic but the songs selected didn't really help her cross over to the wider pop chart audience.\n\nI think that once again, Clive Davis was trying to throw a little bit of everything at the listening audience to see which tracks would \"hit\", Jen's powerful voice was toned down on a lot of the tracks and some of the tracks seem like throw-aways - not designed to show those who are unfamiliar with Jen exactly who she is as an artist. I didn't mind that a couple of the tracks are gospel oriented because if Aretha Franklin can successfully give us r&b, pop & gospel so can this young woman!\n\nMy favorite tracks are:\n\nGIVING MYSELF - Jen's restrained vocals power this track, there is an alternate sweetness & power to her voice that makes this track interesting\n\nSPOTLIGHT - catchy song\n\nYOU PULLED ME THROUGH - great power ballad\n\nIF THIS ISN'T LOVE - a synth-pop sounding track that's taken some time to grow on me\n\nI'M HIS ONLY WOMAN f\/ Fantasia - love the pairing of their voices, both unique and distinctive\n\nCAN'T STOP THE RAIN - melodic track with great lyrics\n\nJESUS PROMISED ME A HOME OVER THERE - touching\n\nAnother song of note is WHAT'S WRONG (GO AWAY) - this song could've been a great duet IF a real male singer had been paired with Jen (someone like Anthony Hamilton or Tyrese).  This is an example of trying to pair her with someone who is \"hot at the moment\" like T-Pain whose vocals ruin this track.\n\nOverall I'm happy that Jen was finally able to get a shot in this business and hope that with her next album, there is a thought out focus so that better singles can be selected to really showcase her as the gifted vocalist that she is.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"With the emphasis on the Motion, Motion City Soundtrack once tried unsuccessfully to take the mantle of pop\/rock from Blink-182. The pop was pretty good, but the rock kind of suffered. As a result, they now sound like a crazed Weezer after an all-night drug-binge. Mark Hoppus acts as band-wrangler this time, and the result is a pop\/punk\/rock tour de mayhem that brings down all musical minds like its cover depicts. And while they may still spend the first half of the album still trying to find themselves, as the cussing becomes more frequent, the quality also rises.\n\nHighlights Include:\nHer Words Destroyed My Planet\nDelirium\nPulp Fiction\n@!#?@!\n\nOverall, MCS is improved in almost every way, lyrically, musically & in catchiness. And while I don't exactly see a mainstream hit here, all fans of the genre should be pretty pleased, and the band should gain a legion of fans here. It may not hit as high as in previous works, but it's still especially solid. So here's to more binges like My Dinosaur Life, I get used to hangovers like this.\n\nReal Score: 4.5\n\nNote: Don't get the censored version of this album. MCS is a lot better at working curse words into their songs this time around, and the lyrics are certainly lost more if they're bleeped out. Especially \"@!#?@!\" which I imagine would sound like a lot of dead air. Trust me, you'd be missing out. Parts of the album get pretty dark for the kiddies anyways.","classification":5,"fold":4}
{"text":"Despite the number of releases in the late 90's with the Anthology series, the Beatles greatest songs have been compiled only one time in the last 30 years, in 2000's \"1\". It's fun to go back to the companion 1973 releases \"1962-1966\" and this \"1967-1970\" (28 tracks, 99 min.), and marvel in particular at the latter's song selection and sequencing.\nWhile now a bit awkwardly on 2 CDs, the original double vinyl was the perfect package. The song selection is just about perfect, really. Nothing to take away from \"1\", but can you really call that the ultimate compilation of the Beatles when it doesn't have \"A Day in the Life\" (the definitive Beatles song?) or \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\"? Maybe it's too soon yet after \"1\", but I really believe there is room for a 2 CD collection of the entire Beatles catalogue (greatest hits and essential album tracks) along the lines of \"The Definitive Bob Dylan\", a great example of how to use the full capacity of CDs. Is anyone with me on that?","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Up until now my favorite Daft Punk album has been the amazing Discovery, but this album is so good it gives it a run for its money. While most convert albums suffer a bit from the \"noise\" of the crowd's cheers, in this case they actually add to the experience rather than distracting.\n\nDiscovery was a sweet box of evolving melodies, but this is a driving, thrumming, buzzing beat box of awesome! I always loved how the melodies of Discovery melded into each other, making you want to listen to the entire album. This is a series of Daft Punk's best songs mixed together perfectly with enough wonderous glorious bass to benchmark any speaker system.\n\nIf I have a single complaint, it's the that the Close Encounters of the Third Kind opening is missing from the audio recording, and should be included. Other than that, listen to this and enjoy. It's awesome music for just listening, but it's REALLY great for exercise, doing chores, or (obviously) having a dance party. Highly, HIGHLY recommended.\n\nFinal note: If you have a record player the complete Alive Boxed Set is totally worth it as it includes a backstage pass, stickers, bonus tracks, a turntable pad, and a gorgeous art book.","classification":5,"fold":4}
{"text":"Comedy CDs are an iffy recommendation.  What's funny today might bore you tomorrow.  Some jokes are only funny the first time.  Jim Gaffigan's CD, \"Doin' My Time,\" scores high on the replay factor.  Perhaps it's his delivery (dry self-deprecation with a twist of smug).  Perhaps it's his avant-garde style of humor (he spends about a quarter of the time pretending to be a critical female member of his own show, weaving \"her\" comments with his).  Perhaps it's just his voice, which has a malleable whine to it that never gets annoying and which makes his self-mockery seem humorously authentic instead of just patronizing or pathetic.\n\nPart of it is definitely the humor itself.  Whether his jokes make bizarre 180's (\"I used to smoke.  Yeah.  Smoking's real addictive.  But you know what's REALLY addictive?  Heroin.\"), or whether their humor lies in their dead ends; whether they take the \"didja ever notice?\" concept and snap it in half (his \"Hot Pocket\" and bottled water\/Mexican food bits are a good example of this), or whether they're just plain crude, grouchy, silly and dumpy, they all stand up to repeated listenings.  There are a few times where you get the impression that the joke -- such as his bit on glasses -- would work a lot better if you could see the man (and, in fact, most of them are like that; Jim is almost as much fun to watch as he is to listen to), but none of them fail to be laugh-worthy because of it.  Pasty, flabby, and grumpy, though he may be, Jim Gaffigan is also a funny, funny man, and this is a funny, funny CD.\n\n(NOTE: This product comes with a short DVD of his Comedy Central appearance, which is much cleaner than the act to be found on the CD.)","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Believe me, I am not a big fan of the electronic blips and blats that are littered throughout Simple Plan's third full length album. And I also might add that there are no less than 4 ballads on the album (one of which is a transparent re-write of Green Day's \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" and the other sounds way too much like the Backstreet Boys' \"More Than That\"). However, there IS a spectacular ballad on the disc, the piano-laden \"I Can Wait Forever.\" Simple Plan is always at its best, though, when it attacks a straightforward rocker, such as \"Time To Say Goodbye\" and the hook-laden \"Take My Hand.\" The boys don't always hit the mark, but they deserve props for not putting out the same album three times in a row....or like so many bands do, soften out completely (like Relient K). There is a good bit of guitar rock here, and far more hooks than other bands in this genre crank out every few years. I give it four stars because at times the sound is intriguing, and other times it is annoying (like on the disasterously embarrasing track \"Generation'), and although the band goes to great lengths to sound different or unique, in some form or another, you have heard all of these songs before.\n\nHere's a run-through of a few selected tracks:\n\nWhen I'm Gone - First single off the album, big hook & chorus, but  kind of slow-paced.\nTake My Hand - The beat sounds exactly like The Bravery's \"Honest Mistake\" but the hook is very catchy.\nGeneration - Wretched synth intro, worse than Europe's \"Final Countdown.\" This track is embarrassing.\nTime To Say Goodbye - Their trademark pop-punk sound.\nI Can Wait Forever - No, this is not a cover of the song by Air Supply. This is actually a great track and the best the band has ever done. Hope you enjoy.","classification":4,"fold":4}

It falls somewhere between rockers and folkier fare with strong songwriting.\n\n\"Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart\" starts with delicate mandolin gradually adding fuzzy guitars and percussion. \"Try to take a picture of the sun, and it won't help you to see the light\" he sings. \"Before We Disappear\" is an intimate ballad with groovy bass, while \"Murderer Of Blue Skies\" is a bleak song on heartbreak with a lovely guitar solo; \"I can't wait to never be with you again\" he sings in a forlorn voice.\n\nThe title track starts off a tender piano ballad with more instruments building in after the first chorus and Cornell really stretching his vocals, while \"Only These Words\" is a lovely acoustic tale about his young daughter(s).\n\n\"Circling\" is a dreamy ELO\/Beatles-style ballad, while \"Our Time In The Universe\" sets quivery guitars and Middle Eastern sounds to dance beats to good effect. It appears again as a remix with a denser feel. \"Wrong Side\" is atmospheric with cryptic lyrics and an americana feel, absolutely beautiful. \"Misery Chain\" is a moody guitar strum with Cornell crooning and sweeping to his upper range.\n\nIntimate and sometimes edgy, it's always great to hear one of the most incredible voices in rock.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"There are sometimes that a newcomer can deliver a decent song, but could have more to offer. For newcomer Jazmine Sulluvan, she has had a lot she had to prove not only because there have been very few dominant R&B acts, but she had to make her voice and style her own. Her latest single Lions, Tigers & Bears, the third single from her debut album Fearless brings in a very simple and elequent melody to her song, by the orchestrations in the background. The song isn't a bad song at all, but I honestly was expecting a little more from her voice. To be honest with you, the song is at least better than the recent ones Beyonce' has made like Halo and the lagging Diva. Hopefully, Jazmine can bring out something to perform next time that is more than just the big top.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"`Sam's Town' is the sophomore offering from Brit sounding US rockers, The Killers, on which they sound more American than before - Bruce Springsteen circa late seventies\/early eighties to be exact.\n\n`When you were young' is probably the best song The Boss never recorded, a throbbing rocker with an anthemic chorus. Great!! `Sam's town', `For reasons unknown', `The river is wild', and `Read my mind' are more songs in that ilk.\n\nStandouts have got to be `Bling (confession of a king)', a soaring galloping rocker with jangly guitars which is simply brilliant, the more mellow `Uncle Jonny' (think 'Andy, you're a star') with wailing guitars, and the very Brit sounding razor sharp, upbeat, maddeningly catchy `Bones'.\n\nSlowing things down is the epic `My list' featuring a vulnerable delivery from Brandon Flowers, the lovely Brit (especially The Cure) sounding `Why do I keep counting?', and the brief Beatlesesque 'Exitlude'.\n\nFeaturing a bigger, more stadium sound, this CD performs the rare feat of improving on the band's debut, which was itself a killer!!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"As my obsession with Lady Gaga grows (I never in a million years thought I'd ever utter those words) I find myself covered in glee as I discover these `Cherrytree Sessions' here.  So far I've picked up two (this and Robyn's, both exceptional).  If you want to get a different taste of three tracks off `The Fame', then this is a great buy!\n\nThe Piano and Voice version of `Poker Face' is outstanding, and if you've seen her play this live on any of her many television appearances then most likely you've heard at least the intro to this version, for she usually opens `Poker Face' on the piano.  It's weird to think that the girl who lavishly dropped `Just Dance' on the unsuspecting public is actually talented, but OMG she really is, and this track is one of many that proves it.\n\nSome have balked at the inclusion of the Stripped Down version of `Just Dance'.  It's funny that the song that makes you famous actually becomes your Achilles Heal over time.  This is one of her weakest tracks on `The Fame', but I actually like what she does with it here.  Sure, it doesn't really feel `stripped' down (I would have loved to hear this over an acoustic guitar) but it works, and the short running time is a bonus.  Regardless, her voice is very good, and it shows.\n\nThe biggest surprise for me came with the Electric Piano and Human Beat Box version of `Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)', namely because I really didn't like the original version of this song on `The Fame' and actually really LOVE what she does with it here.  It has so much character and her vocals are stellar and the song that once appeared bland and boring springs to life with a beat boxing background that calls to mind Justin Timberlake's `Rock Your Body' (the closing, obviously).  It was such a pleasant surprise to actually be taken aback by the way she recreated this track and delivered something superior and enticing.\n\nSo, this is a tiny little bundle, but it's worth it for any fan of La'Gaga, and who isn't a fan?","classification":5,"fold":4}
{"text":"I instantly became a fan of Mary J. Blige once I heard the song \"You Remind Me\".  Her debut CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/What-s-the-411\/dp\/B000002OME\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">What's the 411?<\/a>&nbsp;was an instant favorite of mine because of the way that Mary mixed r&b songs with hip hop samples.  Obviously, the direction of the production had something to do with that but since I am also a rap music fan, I was able to appreciate Mary J. Blige even more.  My favorite tracks ended up being \"Love No Limit\", \"Reminisce\", \"I Don't Want To Do Anything\" w\/K-Ci, \"My Love\", \"Real Love\" and Mary's remake of the Rufus & Chaka Khan classic \"Sweet Thing\".  In 1994, Mary J. Blige released her 2nd CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/My-Life\/dp\/B000002OU8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">My Life<\/a>.  This is clearly my favorite r&b CD of all time.  Mary not only surpassed my expectations after her debut CD, but she definitely had gained a fan for life as she did her best to chronicle the good times, the pain and everything inbetween to put together a fantastic CD.  My favorite track was \"I Never Wanna Live Without You\" but I could play the CD in its entirety.  My other personal favorites include \"Mary's Joint\", \"I'm The Only Woman\", \"Be Happy\", \"Mary Jane\" and \"Be With You\".  The alternate versions of the tracks were phenominal as well.  I am sure everyone remembers Smif N Wessun on \"I Love You\", LL Cool J on \"Mary Jane\", and the late Notorious BIG (Biggie) ripping the \"I'm Goin' Down\" (Remix)) which used the beat for the track \"The What\" that was featured on Biggie's \"Ready To Die\" that also included Method Man.  Mary J had plenty of other releases:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Share-My-World\/dp\/B000002P64\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Share My World<\/a>&nbsp;(1997)\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mary\/dp\/B00000JWQH\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mary<\/a>&nbsp;(1999)\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/No-More-Drama\/dp\/B00005V9DW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">No More Drama<\/a>&nbsp;(2002)\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Love-Life\/dp\/B0000AQS8W\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Love & Life<\/a>&nbsp;(2003)\n\nFrom these 4 releases you had my personal favorites such as \"Seven Days\", \"All That I Can Say\", \"The Love I Never Had\", \"Special Part Of Me\", \"Ooh!\", \"Everything\" and \"Share My World\".  Mary J. returned in 2005 with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Breakthrough\/dp\/B000BNTM32\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Breakthrough<\/a>.  She enjoyed tremendous success with her 1st single \"Be Without You\".  \"Darkchild\" blessed her with my favorite track, \"Enough Cryin'\" and my other favorites included \"I Found My Everything\", \"Take Me As I Am\", \"No One Will Do\" and \"Father In You\".  Mary's record company got a little greedy with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Reflections-A-Retrospective\/dp\/B000JU8HHE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Reflections - A Retrospective<\/a>.  The CD started off with 4 new tracks which included the single \"We Ride\", the title track and \"King & Queen\" w\/John Legend.  Then Geffen tried to conduct a greatest hits CD with the rest of the CD which was a mere 11 tracks, with 2 of the tracks being songs that were never on her CDs but were quality collaborations with the remix to Method Man's \"All I Need\", that was featured on \"Tical\" and \"911\" w\/Wyclef Jean.\n\n\"Growing Pains\" was released on December 18th, 2007.  The CD starts off with the uptempo \"Work That\".  Mary makes an uplifting anthem for the ladies that tells them to be happy with themselves and not to live everyday trying to please other people.  Do your best to work with the best attributes that you have.  Ludacris appears on \"Grown Woman\" to return the favor for Mary J. appearing on the track \"Runaway Love\" that was featured on Ludacris' last release \"Release Therapy\".  In my opinion, \"Grown Woman\" is basically a continuation of \"Work That\".  You have to come to a point in your life where you are happy with yourself as a woman, mentally and physically.  Mary J. has struggled with that fact for many years in her life and she is trying to be a positive example for ladies, young and old around the world.  Luda does a decent job with his verse but he is trying to talk about some things that could be done with this woman instead of adding to the positivity that Mary is trying to bring to the track, with a touch of attitude.  \"Just Fine\" is basically Growing Pains' \"Family Affair\".  It doesn't matter how the week at work was or what trials and tribulations that you went through during the course of the week, it's Friday night and this beat comes on, go out and have a good time or just do the infamous 2 step like I do.  \"Just Fine\" is a nice, uptempo feel good jam.  \"Feel Like A Woman\"  has Mary talking to her man about making her feel appreciated as a woman.  Whether it's a shopping trip, making love to her through the night or just making a nice gesture, tonight she just wants to feel like a woman.  The slow jam man, Bryan Michael Cox shows up to produce \"Stay Down\", which is a thoughtful slow jam.  In every relationship, you are going to have ups and downs.  No relationship is perfect.  The relationship is enduring one of those down times and Mary is asking her man to try to keep putting up with these down times so that they can receive the greater award at the end.  \"Hurt Again\" has Mary describing a situation where she is starting to have feelings for someone but she is hesitant in letting him know that because of all the times that she has been hurt in the past.  \"Shake Down\" is tolerable but when you see Usher and Mary J. Blige on a track, you have huge expectations.  Just like when you saw Usher and Alicia Keys on the track \"My Boo\", you expect the artists to make the collaboration memorable.  On \"Shake Down\", it's decent but nothing that you would expect when you have Mary and Usher on the same track.  Pharrell does his best to try to take you back to the 80s on \"Til The Morning\", but for the most part, unless you want to grab some old fashioned roller skates and go to the skating rink, this song won't work for most Mary J. Blige fans.  On \"Roses\", Mary has to get a point across to her man that she is fed up with all of the confrontations with her man and today she is not having it for any reason.  I can definitely relate to this track.  Men:  You're in a no win situation when this day comes so let her vent and this type of day will go by faster and be much easier for you to handle...lol\n\nClearly, my favorite track on \"Growing Pains\" is \"Fade Away\".  Stargate, who has produced multilple Ne-Yo songs, Joe's \"It's Me\", Chris Brown's \"With You\", Rihanna & Ne-Yo's \"Hate That I Love You\", Trey Songz' \"Can't Help But Wait\" and most importantly to some people, Beyonce's \"Irreplaceable\", produce this memorable Mary J. track in \"Fade Away\".  Ne-Yo co-produces and writes the track as well.  Mary finds herself at times, because of all of her troubles not even wanting to be here on Earth.  That's how bad times have gotten for her in the past.  Although, her life is definitely much better than those times, she may still have moments where she feels like she did before irregardless of her success because of her past transgressions.  Ne-Yo does an excellent job of reaching back so to speak in times in Mary's past to capture these moments.  Here's the bridge: \"Couldn't look myself in the mirror, asking myself how dumb could you be.\"  \"Maybe everything would be much clearer, if no one could see me\".  Mary's times in the past were so bad she didn't even want to me amongst the living at times.  There were times when she just want to take herself out of this world and not even be here anymore.  That's where I feel the \"....invinsibility would be great\" part comes from on the track.  \"What Love Is\" is another memorable Mary, Stargate and Ne-Yo collaboration as Mary writes her rendition of what she feels the four letter word means just like Alicia Keys did on \"The Thing About Love\" from her \"As I Am\" CD.  The effects at the end of the track add to the track as well.  \"Work In Progress\" (Growing Pains) is also written by Ne-Yo as Mary walks you through how she is getting through life day by day the best she can.  She is clearly trying her best, but she also wants to let women in the world know that she is just as human as they are despite her success.  \"Talk To Me\" deals with Mary wanting to receive better communication from her man and the benefits of effective communication in a relationship.  \"If You Love Me\" is a decent track but it sounds too much like \"Be Without You\" Part 2 to me.  \"Smoke\" is clearly unlike any Mary J. Blige track that I have ever heard.  This track seems to be a part of Mary J.'s musical maturity. You never would have heard Mary on a track like this in the What's The 411 and My Life days.  As a matter of fact, she would have had a profanity laced tirade ready for Puffy if he even tried to bring her a track like this.  In the end, it clearly works for me and it's nice to see Mary trying different things.  \"Come To Me (Peace)\" ends \"Growing Pains\" on a good note as she is trying to win over the affection of a lost love from the past.\n\nOverall, \"Growing Pains\" may not be Mary J. Blige's best CD, but if you look at her career since 1992's \"What's The 411\" to now, you see alot of progression in her music and lyrics in 2007.  Not only do you see a growth process with Mary as a 37 year old woman but you also hear the growth process through her lyrics and her production.  If you are a fan of the majority of Mary J's releases, then you should also add \"Growing Pains\" to your collection.\n\nJames' Top 5\n\n1) Fade Away\n2) What Love Is\n3) Stay Down\n4) Smoke\n5) Work In Progress (Growing Pains)\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\nHurt Again\nRoses\nCome To Me (Peace)\nWork That\nJust Fine","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Kate Smith (Kathryn Elizabeth Smith May 1, 1907 to June 17, 1986) was born in Washington, D.C.  From an early age she loved to sing and dance.  She performed locally in theatres and at nightclubs and was discovered by a New York City show producer in 1926.  She was featured in the musical comedy Honeymoon Lane on Broadway and later in Hit the Deck and Flying High...Kate began making records in 1926; among her biggest hits were `River, Stay 'Way From My Door (1931);'  `The Woodpecker Song (1940);' `The White Cliffs of Dover (1941);' `I Don't Want to  Walk Without You (1942);' `There Goes That Song Again (1944);' `Seems Like Old Times (1946)' and `Now Is the Hour (1947).' In the fifties she began making LP albums and (Kate's) theme song was `When the Moon Comes over the Mountain,' whose lyrics she helped write. Irving Berlin regarded the song she made most famous, `God Bless America,' as his most important composition.  Kate predicted, in 1938, that the song would still be sung long after all of us are gone - and it surely will.\"\n\nAnd Kate doesn't let us down here with her superlative rendition of \"God Bless America.\" As we head toward the July 4th holiday our nation will be celebrating 236 of liberty since July 4th, 1776. I don't think I've ever heard a patriotic song as stirring and emotional as \"God Bless America;\" Kate was born to sing this song and many others. Although she sang \"God Bless America\" on countless occasions and there are slightly different variations of the song for download on this website, Kate's treatment of \"God Bless America\" here is definitely my favorite. Kate sings with exceptional passion and you can tell how deeply she means what she's singing just by listening to this MP3 file for download. Her voice is as clear as a bell, too.\n\nKate Smith was a national treasure and she lives on through her music. I highly recommend this recording of Kate singing \"God Bless America.\"","classification":5,"fold":4}

There's a few places where the songs are an awkward match, almost forced, but in other spots you'll ask \"how has nobody ever put these tracks together before\"? I'm sure some rappers hear Girl Talk and say \"damn, I shoulda used that sample\". The rock and pop songs I knew most of. The rap stuff I knew maybe 1\/3 if that, but still cool to hear. I think to enjoy this you've got to be open to most anything. Just a total music lover. Great for short attentions also. If you like the idea of Jay-Z over Radiohead, Public Enemy over Heart, or Tag Team over Big Country, get it. Is money tight? I believe all Girl Talk albums are free downloads on their website.

I had even heard 2112, so I still wonder why it took me so long to hear Working Man. Perhaps because the internet wasn't around yet?\n\nWorking Man is a brick fortress of 70s power trio rock. The opening guitar riff is like poured concrete, reinforced by industrial strength bass and drums. Similar to Light My Fire in that it follows the vocals-long instrumental-vocals pattern. Geddy Lee sings about the day to day pattern of a guy doing the typical 9-5 job. At 2:05, Geddy plays a descending bass line and the tempo kicks up into Alex Lifeson's guitar solo that lasts just long enough to enjoy a nice cold beer.\n\nWhen a Cleveland radio station began playing it, many listeners thought it was a new Led Zeppelin song. Rush's first album is definitely in that vein, since Neil Peart hadn't yet joined to apply his PhD in Science Fiction lyrics. John Rutsey was their drummer.

Two great voices in fine form, performing some songs that suit them perfectly and taking some chances on a few unlikely cover versions. I'm not disappointed in the least. This isn't the sort of album that's intended to break new musical ground or convert new fans (although that wouldn't be a bad thing either; the more people who discover these great artists, the better!), but serves as aural comfort food to those who have followed them over the years.

{"text":"To ME, Lincoln Brewster is one of the great guitarists, not only in Christian music, but in the entire world of music, not ONLY doing his own albums, but writing and composing for such well known groups as \"Hillsong\"!\nThis, his Christmas album for 2012, follows his tradition of churning out not only great compilations, but great sounding guitar riffs from metal rock, to a bluesy soulful, haunting effect! The full blown instrumental on the album, Miraculum, (one of, if not his ONLY fully instrumentals on any album) has about all of these elements! Combining full sounding violins and other stringed instruments and keyboards with his fast fingered rock-electrics takes you on a roller coaster of emotions! Combining \"Oh Holy Night\" with \"Another Hallelujah\" his version is sure to appear in worship services this season!\nCombine that with the fast pace of \"Little Drummer Boy\", featuring the Christian Rapper KJ52, and you're ready to wrap the presents!\nIn short, if you are already a fan of Brewster, or just want to update your collection with a modern Christmas sound, this album fits the bill!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"It was not long after Tinas first album in 2002 that she met world chant artist Jai Uttal who expanded her musical horizons to the ancient Eastern spiritual tradition of Sanskrit mantras. Tinas new album takes it a step farther and includes chants, not only in Sanskrit, but also in Hebrew, Gurmukhi, and English, along with instrumental accompaniment. A distinguishing factor about Tinas music is that unlike some mantra chanting which can be more repetitive, these have a more song-like quality and there is evolution within each piece as it flows through various movements with buildups, refrains, and instrumental solos.\n\nAs I got deeper into the album, one of the things that stood out to me was the incredibly inventive and unique blending of instruments that accompanied the vocals. On Sita Ram for example, a bouncy bass line, vibraphone, and snare drum played with brushes are joined by, of all things, a lap steel guitar. In an interesting contrast to the lush and lavish production of most of the pieces, a track called Ek Ong Kar, presents a more Zen-like ambience with only the sound of chirping birds and a simple metronomic rhythm to accompany the relatively unadorned sound of Tinas vocals. Another intriguing juxtaposition was the Hindu chant of Om Namo Narmadev set against an African-sounding acoustic guitar rhythm. Like many of the songs on Bridge To Vallabha, it begins simply and builds as it goes along adding a full ensemble.\n\nThe level of production on this album is impressive. The choice of instrumentation adds to the magic of the listening experience and is expertly integrated and mixed to provide the perfect background for Tinas exquisite vocals. If I were to go into detail on the quality of her singing for each of the pieces, I would quickly run out of superlatives. Tina Malia is without a doubt, one of the most outstanding and unique voices in this genre today. I particularly appreciated how her presentation of these ancient mantras in a contemporary context added to their musicality, yet maintained the deeply sacred vibration they are intended to convey.","classification":5,"fold":4}
{"text":"Since everybody knows how big this album was and how much drama that surrounded it, I'll give a brief review of the album,\n\nOn \"Intro\" there is no rapping or talking, all we hear is a coin drop, following that we go into the next track produced by Rob \"Reef\" Tewlow, \"What Up Gangsta\" and the beat is sick especially when it first comes on, The good doctor gave fif a hit with \"In da Club\", you couldn't go anywhere without hearing the song or somebody just rapping the lyrics \"Go shorty, it's your birthday\/ We gonna party like it's your birthday!\" The other singles were \"21 Questions\" (featuring Nate Dogg), its one of those would you be down for if I didn't have this type of song. \"Many Men (Wish Death)\" is the best song on here. On \"Back Down\", he also throws more shots on \"Heat\" the Dr. Dre's beat is simple, it has a constant guncok sound. Em shows up twice, on \"Patiently Waiting\" where he easily outshines Curtis and \"Don't Push Me\", also featuring Lloyd Banks. On the latter Em is rapping about the same stuff as 50 but he doesn't get called out for it? Double standard? But on another note it was a dope track. There are some missteps on here though \"Blood Hound\" (featuring Young Buck) was just too boring for me, the pimping anthem \"P.I.M.P.\" cant even be saved by his catchy hook. His braggadocios raps brings the down the album as well, at least switch it up sometimes! We know you got 9 times, we know you went from noting to something tell us something we don't know. As for the bonus tracks \"Wanksta\" took him to another level, it appeared on the G-Unit mixtape then the 8Mile sdtk, \"U Not Like Me\" and \"Life's on the Line\" were out before he was even signed. Overall I think 50 dropped a classic album and lets not try to rewrite history, this was biggest album of 2003. If you do buy it I suggest getting a used one for 5 dollars or less. I heard all 50s album and trust me this is the one worth checking out besides Power Of The Dollar.","classification":5,"fold":4}

This is by far my favorite from her visual album, she also has five part video on her vevo channel on youtube where she discusses the creation of her album. This would be great for anyone who enjoys Beyonce, particularly her latest album. I have always enjoyed her music but because there is so much depth and meaning behind this song it became my favorite. Most of the youtube videos with music from her most recent album are fast paced where it doesn't sound like Beyonce singing, or because of some law violation about pirated\/copied music not all the songs are there in their entirety, which is another reason why I bought the MP3, since I was tired of listening to the songs on youtube which weren't of the best quality and didn't sound like Beyonce at all.","classification":4,"fold":4}

The band sounds exceptionally tight and professional, and the music flows with a naturally sincere warmth that reminds you why it matters.  Recalls artists like the Black Keys, Wilco, Sweet Apple, Dr. Dog, the Reigning Sound, Firewater, the Replacements, Built To Spill, the Hold Steady.

I'm not going to get into Jani vrs Robert (lead singer debate)  I like both!  Most know Jani because of Warrant but Robert (from a few bands but notably Big C*ck! Great Music!) Anywhooo, this release is pretty good, they mix it up well like Warrant has on prior records.  I like Born Again, a bit better, but give it time and this might change as (1day after Rockaholic's release) it's too early to really make a fair assessment.  I might update this, I might not.  But for $10 ($9on-a-DgtlDwnld) it's currently good enough to listen too, until I learn all the words (oh yeah, there are no lyrics printed typical Warrant-WTF)! Well on-you-go get your order on become a Rockaholic!\n\nMay 24th, 2011\n\nOk...update time!  100% Better than Ultraphobic!  I hate to say it, but Jani is so 80's and Robert is so 80's plus 10! As in Crank it to 10!  Like Junkyard(the band) said...\"Put it on 10 and pull the knobs off!\"  This record is starting \"Kiss Yer @$$ in every way\" (go ahead buy it find out what song here-in contain those lyrics!) Straightup R to the OCK!  To many people get hung up on the LEAD SINGER, as most people don't actually listen to the whole package.  This record has the riffy guitars, the blues & the grunge guitars, as well as the melodic guitars (wa-wa stuff as I call it) Robert's voice is SOLID and carries!  Take WARRANT (the \"BAND\" name) outta the equation, and this record deserves to be in every True Rock Fans arsenal!\n\nSong inventory:\nI like the following enough to create playlists and add them to mix's:\n 1-Sex Ain't Love (great driving to the bar song...hope you find what yer looking)\n 2-Innocnece Gone (great song for the young summer type heading to the beach looking for love)\n 3-Snake ( (s)he who cheats can relate)\n 4-Dusty's Revenge (Bluesy\/Country vibe but heavy and grungy guitars...Gods speed)\n 5-Home (slow song to play yer girl if just got into a fight...Man you were wrong)\n 6-What Love Can Do (contemporary type song that could be played on the radio, kinda Def Leppardy)\n 7-Life's A Song (definately a growup and reflect song, check out the video utube it!)-cheesy? maybe but solid\n 8-Show Must Go On (totally break out the fith and put yer fav record on then crank it to 10 and drink!)Dr. RX\n 9-Cocaine Freight Train (SEX...\"Honey yer like Cocaine, when I'm on you I want More, More, More!\") says it all!\n10-Found Forever (slow song) every record needs one, total Ballad!  Gotta Love'em\n11-Candy Man (here come the wa-wa's....\"You can make the pain go away\") I want more....\n12-Sunshine (Melodic, good mix of guitars)\n13-Tears In The City (another ballad type...I've heard better)\n14-The Last Straw (Great fast ending makes you wanna hit 'replay cd' def'n'tly an early 80's vibe)\n\nSo there you have it!

The rhythms are expertly intertwined to make a haunting and beautiful musical experience. I love this tune and consider it the best of Massive Attack (so far).

{"text":"I recently saw \"Gone Girl\" in the theatre (more on that later). \"Gone Girl is the most recent movie directed by David Fincher, and as he has done so on two prior occasions (2011's \"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" and 2009's \"The Social Network\"), he called once again on Nine Inch Nail's Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross to provide the soundtrack, As before, Reznor and Ross have delivered an electronic soundscape that is dark and dense, yet immensely appealing if you like that kind of music.\n\n\"Gone Girl - Soundtrack from the Motion Picture\" (24 tracks; 86 min.) start with an immediate mood-setter \"What Have We Done To Each Other\", which plays as the movie opens and we really don't know yet what is about to play out. It is haunting and foreboding. \"Sugar Storm\" is one of the brightest tunes here, it comes as we see a flashback as to how Nick and Amy met, and all was well. \"With Suspicion\" is a more abstract tune that comes as we see the police starting to suspect Nick in Amy's disappearance, As mentioned before, this album contains little or no \"melodies\", as in: tunes with a \"hook\" (there are one or two exceptions, such as \"The Way He Looks At Me\" and \"Technically, Missing\"). This album is mostly a mood piece that paints or accompanies a particular moment in the movie. A great plus for those who haven't seen the movie yet is that, unlike many soundtracks these days, you cannot make out the plot from simply looking at the track titles. Reznor and Ross bring it all home with the last track, \"At Risk\", an 11 min. mini-suite that reprises all of the musical leitmotifs found earlier in the soundtrack. As such it is ultimately the essential tune of this massive soundtrack. If you like mostly abstract electronic soundscapes, you cannot go wrong with this, and I also might suggest you check out the recent soundtrack to \"Under the Skin\", the Scarlett Johansson-starring science fiction flick with an outstanding electronic score by British musician Mica Levi (a\/k\/a Micachu).\n\nA quick word as to the movie: it is a tense and gripping \"did he or didn't he kill his wife\" mystery-thriller. The early afternoon screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was absolutely PACKED. All the people in line in front of me also bought tickets for \"Gone Girl\", and I see no reason why this crime drama couldn't reach the $100 million box office club. This is Hollywood at its best, period, and it confirms once again that David Flinch is one of the top directors of this generation.\n\nBottom line: \"Gone Girl\", both the movie and the soundtrack, is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Gregorian chant is one on the most beautiful, relaxing, and spiritual music that I can think of that has came out of our ancient past.  I am a counselor and one of my supervisors introduced me to chants.  At first, I did not like chants, and they were in Latin which I do not understand.  However, I have come to love this kind of music, and I have quite a collection of actual monks from different monasteries singing them.  I really did not need another CD of them.  However, when I heard the way that these chants were sung, it did not take me long to buy it.  Capella Gregoriana sing with a feeling that is not hurried and sincere.  They pause at the end of each phrase, letting their voices echo, and this gives it that prayerful feeling.  It is great to listen to any time of the day or night.  I have a CD alarm clock and every morning I wake up to Gregorian Chant.  I have done this for about 15 years now, and I have visited several monasteries where I have been able to hear chants live.  I can just picture a huge cathedral where you can hear their voices echoing throughout a huge, cavernous, and sacred space.  Most chants are from the Psalms in the Bible, and they are sung prayers to God, asking Him for guidance, protections from evil, or help in times of trouble.  They are used collectively to worship our Creator who has given us the bodies and voices that we use to praise Him.  It can be used for meditation as well.  It also can be used as a way of centering yourself just before centering prayer and a time of silence, placing yourself in the presence of God.  May God richly bless your life and fill you with his Spirit as you listen to these chants.  Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Hardcore rock is not typically my cup my tea, but I enjoyed Pierce The Veil's \"Collide With The Sky\" from start to finish. I'm open minded musically.  Every once in awhile I try listening to music styles and artists that are different from what I'm familiar with. Sometimes I don't like it; sometimes I end up liking it. I recently tried some post-hardcore and metalcore bands.  I couldn't get into any metalcore, but I could get into post-hardcore that is highly melodic and\/or has a lead vocalist with a good voice. And Pierce The Veil is highly melodic, and lead vocalist Vic Fuentes does have a good voice.\n\nPierce The Veil are an above average band in their genre if they can get a non-hardcore rock fan like myself to really enjoy their latest album.  I `rocked out' while listening to it, as well as appreciated the craft of the songs.  The rhythms are very complex and change several times on some songs.  There's genre-mixing on this album.\n\nChoice tracks are \"King for a Day\", \"Bulls in the Bronx\", and \"Props & Mayhem\".  \"King for a Day\" has Kellin Quinn's (of Sleeping With Sirens) vocals compliment Fuentes' nicely. \"Bulls in the Bronx\" adds a Latin flair to post-hardcore. \"Props & Mayhem\" has more of a pop-punk base.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"It is a shame that Brian McKnight has lost his fan-base from years ago.  This album truly isn't bad or uninspired by any means.  In fact, it is better than his last release, U TURN.  Brian McKnight has what I consider one of the best voices in R&B. What makes him interesting as a musician is the fact that he combines contemporary R&B with contemporary jazz. The downside of that combination is that sometimes McKnight comes over too contemporary or too urban.\n\nThe main downside of GEMINI is the fact that Brian McKnight really doesn't try to alter his formula any. Unfortunately, that is one of the reasons that I think GEMINI has bombed on the Billboard Charts,which is said considering Brian McKnight deserves to be going platinum easily.  I think to regain his fan base, his next album will have to be a little different from U TURN or GEMINI, which are very solid albums.\n\nGEMINI has several good hits including \"What We Do Here\", \"Everyime You Go Away\" (my personal favorite), \"Grown Man Business\", and \"Here With You\".  Where Gemini loses credibility is when it grows too urban and the songs sound too much alike.  As an album, it's certainly not the album of the year for 2005-06, but it isn't bad by any means.  If you aren't into the dance-pop\/club facet of R&B these days (Ciara, Nivea (via \"Okay\"), or Amerie), then this album is probably for you.  This album is in league with Kem; a mix of contemporary jazz & contemporary R&B.  3.5 stars.","classification":4,"fold":4}

I admit that I first heard The Way You Move by Outkast (feat. Sleepy Brown) back around 2003 when I was living in California.  One of the positives about this song is that women of various shapes, sizes, skin complexions, hair textures\/hair lengths,and personalities are featured in the online music video that is currently available for free viewing (which to me the online music video sends out a powerful\/healing indirect message of why it is helpful to think highly of yourself regardless of how you are externally seen and\/or perceived).","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"If you've heard Isadar's previous music and think you are familiar with his style, as the saying goes, \"you ain't heard nothing yet.\" While still a solo piano recording, Red opens the door to a whole new dimension of Isadar's keyboard talent and vision. Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of Red is the infusion of high-energy jazz and neo-classical elements into Isadar's generally impressionistic new age style. On Red, Isadar steps out and charts a bold new direction for his music.\n\nInterestingly, Red is being released around Valentines Day, and opens with a track entitled \"Broken Valentine.\" This piece is a perfect example of the creative freedom Isadar has chosen to express on this album. As I listened to the lovely emotionally moving melody, I assumed that the entire composition would unfold along similar lines. So I had a bit of a surprise after about a minute when the piece suddenly took off in a decidedly jazzier direction, with the feel of a hang glider pilot leaping off a cliff and taking to the wind. At this point, I experienced a side of Isadar's playing that I hadn't heard before quite like this. It was powerful, passionate, and spirited, bringing to mind jazz greats Keith Jarrett and Chick Corea. Yet even in the midst of this intense forward motion, Isadar makes good use of dynamics and modulates the tempo and movement using an occasional pregnant pause as a prelude to shifting musical gears.\n\nThe title song does not have quite the same dramatic ratio of yin to yang as the first track, but does shift freely between a flowing melody and a bouncy rhythmic motif within the composition. \"The Man Who Broke My Heart\" is a lush evocative piece that highlights Isadar's ability to dig deep into emotional terrain with impeccable style and grace. Likewise on \"The Stairwell,\" which is a beautifully sensitive piece that unlike some of the earlier songs has a higher degree of thematic consistency throughout, although there are some crescendos that are quite powerful within the context of the song's subtlety. \"Letting Go\" marks a return to Isadar's pattern of contrasting diverse elements within the framework of a single composition. Starting out in a more wistful and melancholy air, it evolves, within its nine-minute length, into a markedly different space that actually had my head nodding and my toe tapping along with it.\n\nRed is a masterful recording that encompasses stunning technique, imaginative composition, and the willingness to take a risk in following the pied piper of one's muse, wherever it may lead. I have every reason to believe that listeners will happily get in line behind him on this exciting musical adventure.","classification":5,"fold":4}

It is sad that someone like Rihanna, doesn't deliver with her own work anymore. It is sad that she put all the effort into making the songs for her Anti album, and she hasn't been able to win over new fans from beginning to the end. When I first heard Work, not only was I unimpressed, I really felt her own voice was tired and felt less authentic than before. Kiss It Better, her second track from Anti didn't fair better. Needed Me, the third single from Anti is one song that showed she was trying to be more aggressive in sound, but instead, she just falls back much further along the line. She didn't bring out anything new into the song, and instead Rihanna just misses that songbird mark yet all over again. Perhaps, it is time for Rihanna to just retire. Because we don't need another wannabe.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":4}

{"text":"The group that later became The Miracles was formed in 1955 by five teenage friends from Detroit, Michigan, under the name The Five Chimes. Three of the founding members, Smokey Robinson, Pete Moore and Ronald White had been singing together since they each were around the age of eleven. The group, influenced by acts such as Billy Ward and His Dominoes and Nolan Strong & the Diablos, featured Clarence Dawson and James Grice in the original lineup. A chance meeting with with record producer Berry Gordy Jr. in 1957 would ultimately lead to a contract with Motown records. In addition, Smokey Robinson made major contributions to the success of Motown, a fact acknowledged by label founder Berry Gordy Jr., when he surprised the singer with a corporatevice president title in 1961.\n\nDuring the 1960's the music of The Miracles would become a fixture on Top 40 radio. During that decade The Miracles would amass an impressive total of 24 Top 40 hits. In June 1967, shortly after Motown changed the name of the group to Smokey Robinson and The Miracles, Tamla records released \"More Love\". Here was yet another gorgeous ballad from the pen of Smokey Robinson. The tune would peak at #23 on the pop charts and reached #5 on the R&B charts.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I'm surprised to see such low reviews for this album. I, in fact, loved it for the most part. Sunshine Anderson is a very talented artist and those who say that she can't sing are just used to a certain kind of singing from your Mary J. Bliges and Aaliyahs. Sunshine has a raspy alto that fits well with the production that Mike City lays down for the album.\nDon't let the first single fool you. Though \"Heard it All Before\" is the title, I haven't heard an album like this with so many varied themes since 1999, where the only thing on female singers' minds was kicking their man to the curb. This song follows the same pattern, but what really sold the song was the catchy percussion, the Issac Hayes-like bass in the background, and the cool male and female background vocals. On the rest of Your Woman, be ready to witness varied production styles and different takes on heard-it-all-before subject matter (sorry, I couldn't resist).\nCheck out \"Being Away\" where Sunshine's personality shows: \"Baby I'm going out of town to handle some business\/For a few days but don't you worry\/'Cause I'll call you like it's not long distance.\" Lyrics like these are pretty original and good at the same time, just like in \"Letting Down My Guard\" when she says to a man that she's ready to love, \"You seem like your mama raised you right.\" And \"Lunch or Dinner\" is the perfect wanna-get-to-know-you jams as the music itself is warm and inviting.\nLyrically, the album loses steam by the time \"You Do You\" comes on, but the melody in that song is so good for you to not even care. I advise everyone to add this album to their R&B collection because its playback value is really high. Of course, if you're not feeling the vibe of a REAL R&B artist like Sunshine, then you're probably the trendy kind who listens to J. Lo records while sipping on a Smirnoff Ice. To each his own, I guess.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Allan hit his stride with 1999's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Smoke-Rings-in-the-Dark\/dp\/B00002CF4F\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Smoke Rings in the Dark<\/a>, and recorded a series of albums that retained his California twang even as Nashville dug in its fingers. His eighth album still offers some edgy and forceful vocals, but starts out with several tunes whose arrangements of piano, organ, strings and studio drums resound with Nashville's overbearing contemporary country-rock sound. Allan's relegated his superior original material to the album's second-half, opening the album with songs from Music City pros whose work leaves a more calculated impression. The productions on the first few cuts overwhelms Allan's earthiness, and even the sprightly \"That Ain't Gonna Fly\" sounds more like a studio band attempting to rock than a country band actually rocking.\n\nBut the mainstream sound fades away when the album reaches Allan's original material at track six. The intimate details of \"We Fly by Night,\" co-written with Jamie O'Hara and Odie Blackmon, are given a stately tempo that allows Allan to consider the lyrics and add an echo of Roy Orbison's drama. Or maybe it's an echo of Raul Malo, as Dan Dugmore's steel and gentle notes of vibraphone give this track a compelling sophistication. Allan writes poetically of opening up to opportunities, begging for forgiveness and finding oneself, and the emotion with which he sings his own words is a world away from what he's able to muster for the album's stock Nashville compositions. Perhaps his label didn't trust that Allan's originals were radio-ready, but his songs are deeper and feel as if they're born of personal experience rather than someone else's songwriting appointment.\n\nThos who liked&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/See-If-I-Care\/dp\/B0000CD5HG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">See If I Care<\/a>&nbsp;might skip lightly through the first five tracks, as the album's second half is a twangy and soulful gem worth the wait. The deluxe CD edition adds four bonus cuts: the newly recorded \"Long Summer Days,\" and live versions of \"Right Where I Need to Be,\" \"Best I Ever Had,\" and \"Watching Airplanes\" that were recorded in front of an enthusiastic audience. The disc (which also unlocks on-line video content) is delivered in a digipack with a 16-panel booklet that includes lyrics to the album's core ten tracks. Allan is effective in playing both the country mainstream and its rootsier edges, which may leave some fans enjoying one half of this disc more than the other.

I still would like her even if she was, but she is not, and I'm happy I can tell everybody that.\nSTAND is the ultimate Jewel song, very reminiscent of WHO WILL SAVE YOUR SOUL? from those early days. RUN 2 U is a really cool upbeat dance track. INTUITION is that cool top 30 hit you've heard lately. Read the lyrics. It's classic Jewel. (I love Ms. J's big butt is boss-who do you think this is about :) LEAVE THE LIGHTS ON is a cool jazz-infused song. Ooh so good and Jewel-like! 2 FIND U is a beautiful poetic ballad. A great new kind of song for Jewel, she sings a beautiful ballad like Celine would only she writes her own. FRAGILE HEART is another beautiful poetic ballad more Jewel-like in the vocal area. DOIN' FINE is a cool upbeat dance record that uses the guitar in a really odd that's different and very interesting. 2 BECOME 1 is an excellent song very beautiful even better done live acoustic but excellent on the album; almost a sequel to 2 FIND U. HAUNTED is easily the coolest song she's ever written. It's truly haunting. I feel like I'm stalking Jewel as I hear it and I feel bad for her, but I can't help myself. SWEET TEMPTATION is a really excellent track, more a rock 'n roll record than a dance record. YES U CAN is a cool upbeat rock record she originally wrote for Santana but he decided not to keep. I'm glad he didn't, her performance is great. Such a cool song! YOU & ME=LOVE is another cool upbeat song. The title is the theme of the song. AMERICA is a thought-provoking dance record about what we do in America, whether it be good things or bad things. She mentions plenty of both, and quite skillfully. BECOMING is a great ballad about Jewel becoming, as she constantly becoming other things. She is young, and she is still a work in progress, and she intends to keep acknowledging that truth.\nThis is definitely her second best album to PIECES OF YOU. It is better than THIS WAY and SPIRIT only by a little but nevertheless if you get an album better than those two albums that's really saying something. Folks, Jewel is hear to stay, and so is the ever-present guitar on this album. She is blossoming and you can see it in this CD, and she still has her guitar at her side as she's blossoming. It's beautiful to see her blossoming! Get your copy of 0304 and experience the beauty of this CD and a glimpse at a special artist ever-evolving!","classification":5,"fold":4}

Mr. Gotye makes that possible: giving small hints about how to process the foolishness of your real life and move forward and LIVE that life.

{"text":"Many things have been said about Nirvana sophmore release Nevermind. Nevermind broke Nirvana into the mainstream and a certain kind of alternative music as well. Well I am not to preach what alternative music is however a lot of great acts that were around the time did not get any credit or sales even though their material was way better than this. So many great and original artist who still make excellent album recieved perhaps more attention for their works in the 1990's that they would have gotten before but indeed it seemed though this album seem to change face of rock n roll . Rock ( especially in the US) was about being angry, fast and depressing and many other bands that would perhaps make it big in other countries were not velcomed by American Listeners even though they are a lot more alternative then some of the acts that recieve the same stamp.\nHowever Nevermind has appeared in a lot of best of list around the years and many magazine rank it high as one of the greatest albums of all time. Is this album great. No. It is good but not great.\nThe problem lies in the songwriting. The fact was that Kurt only knew few chords and riffs and managed to write bunch of songs with them. Many of his songs sound the same and are pratically the same but with different lyrics and different tone.\nThe production is flawless however Butch vig who produced it did a very good job with about half of the tracks. Why do I say half well about 5 or 6 songs on this album are just noise. You can't hear what Kurt is singing about and they are very poorly played. The fact is that Butch probably found it very difficult to do something outstanding with these tracks and tried best as he could. The fact that he should have take notes from Steve Albini who recorded and kind of produced Nirvana's third album In Utero and just engineer and mix and skip making anything out of them except that.\nNevermind contains however some good such like Smells Like Teen Spirit, Lithium, In Bloom, Come As You Are, Breed, Polly, On A Plain but the rest is either bad or does not live up to the same qualities as the other songs. These songs are not raw but a plane bore. Perhaps the other members of the band should have helped by writing the other material sole without Kurt's help.\nThe fact is that Nevermind seems like a half-finished album. When you skip these fillers you have 6 songs that are really good. I don't care what this album did for the music business we should look at albums for what they are. These are disc or Vinyl with music on them. If the music is not good the album isn't.\nTo this date many hail Nevermind as one of the rock's greatest albums. It is a good album but certainly not one of rock's greatest achievement in music history and certainly not one of Seattle's grunge best album. The fact is that Kurt Copain was not just a singer-songwriter but he was like Madonna and others a new face in music that everyone wanted a piece of and he was prortrait to be cool and something new however he was not even close of being one of the greatest songwriters of his era he was just lucky.\nAlso is that before his death this album had sold 5 million in the US. After his death it has sold 10 million copies in the US. Pearl Jam sold 11 million copies of their album Ten and nobody died from that band.\nOverall grade 6\/10.","classification":3,"fold":4}

They also use the thesaurus a little too loosely: \"Wed-locked a prison Of antiquation\" Good lord who wrote that? Their music may be copped from Metallica but the lyrics are something you would expect from Natalie Merchant (for you younger people she was the singer of 10,000 Maniacs in the 80's - a favorite of unpopular drama club girls who blamed all of their personal insecurities on society, patriarchy, sexism, homophobia and Ronald Reagan).","classification":2,"fold":4}

{"text":"When it has came down to Rihanna and Kanye West, their songs have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart. But when I had heard they were going to make a song with Paul McCartney, I thought this was going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voices. Only One for Kanye was absolutely awful, and not even worth the time and the effort in regards to the love of his daughter with Kim Kardashian. Rihanna and Kanye West's collaboration with Paul McCartney, Four Five Seconds is absolutely very low for both of them. They have absolutely no chemistry with Sir Paul's classic rhythm and classic songwriting. For Rihanna, it is one of the worst songs she has came out with, and she needs to really find her voice all over again, and for Kanye, it is the most rogue thing he has simply done, and lost his own voice at the same time. For Rihanna fans, she needs much stronger for her next work, and she wasted her own time with low gimmicks.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":4}

{"text":"Now ever since I was introduced to Emotional Rollercoaster, I became such a fan of Vivian Greene. Fortunately for my high school self I was able to have a sister to purchase her album, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Even her second album I enjoyed, even though I didn't have every track on repeat like I did her first album. And I have been one who has been in constant support of artists like Ms. Greene who actually have a voice, can sing, can write and who should have more popularity and respect but don't seem to get it for some reason.\n\nI was happy to notice that Vivian Green was coming out with her 4th album! Seriously, with Brandy's album coming out soon afterwards, I was like this is the cherry on top.\n\nHowever, when I was listening to the single snippets on ITunes (Sorry Amazon, they're a bit longer over there), I was like what happened? Her voice is NOTICEABLY different. And it was a surprise that not many (if any) were really commenting on it. Her voice throughout this album is raspy and scratchy, most noticeable on Supposed to Be Mine, Remedy and Light the Universe. Her voice has always been smooth and angelic, but it was incredibly different this go around. Maybe if I hadn't been exposed to her voice earlier it would not have been an issue for many artists have that unique aspect to their voices (Macy Gray, Ceelo Green, Res, Anastasia, Kelis, etc), but it was just very different. Regardless, this album has definite potential.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"This 2-CD compilation was released in honor of The Beach Boys' 50th Anniversary, and so it contains 50 tracks. Since there have been countless BB collections released in the past, it would be easy to dismiss this one as a grab for money. But, a lot of the previous comps were somewhat limited (some VERY much so) in terms of hit recordings or overall numbers of tracks (or both) and\/or pretty lousy, at least in my opinion --- like the ones that had only ten tracks or so.  And besides, not everyone has all of the group's music or all (if any) of the other collections. The group is gaining new fans all the time! I personally bought this set partly because I'm such a big fan and something of a BB collector, and partly because the set includes some stuff that I didn't have at the time, such as the stereo mixes of \"Do You Wanna Dance,\" \"When I Grow Up (To Be A Man),\" \"Barbara Ann,\" \"Wild Honey,\" and \"Darlin'\" (the last two of which appeared here for the first time in stereo), and the single version of \"Isn't It Time.\" Here's a break-down of the set:\nSONG SELECTION: As you might expect, most of the songs on the set are from the '60s, the period during which the group had the vast majority of their (Top 40) hits, and did the other songs that they are probably most known for. Almost all of their hits are included, and there are also many non-hit single sides and songs that only appeared on albums. I like all of the songs here, though of course (as is the case with any artist's music) some are better than others. Also of course, probably every fan (including this one!) has certain favorite songs that weren't included. A couple of exclusions that I find particularly odd are \"Be True To Your School\" (the single version) and \"Come Go With Me,\" both of which were hits for the group. (Although the former song WAS included on this set's condensed, single-disc \"counterpart,\" The Beach Boys' Greatest Hits, and is the only song there that isn't here also.) I would also have liked it if the songs \"Break Away\" (the \"original\" stereo mix, not the one with some different vocal parts that has appeared on a couple of other collections, including the Made In California box set), \"Long Promised Road,\" \"Marcella,\" and \"California Dreamin'\" had been included, for a few other examples. (\"Break Away\" and the single version of \"Cottonfields\" [which IS here] were the group's last two pre-'80s Capitol single A-sides; if *I* was going to put one but not the other on a compilation, \"Cottonfields\" is the one I would leave off.) And, there WAS room on the set for more than 50 tracks, so I think it would have been better if they hadn't gotten \"poetic\" with the 50th Anniversary thing, and had put more on it. But I also think it's probably the best 2-CD BB collection that I know of.\nTRACK SEQUENCE: The track order on this set is very weird. Not only does it not go in a straight line from the earliest tracks to the latest, but certain songs are positioned around ones that it doesn't seem \"natural\" (at least not to me) for them to be around. For a few examples: the post-'60s recordings \"Getcha Back\" (from '85), \"It's OK,\" and \"Rock And Roll Music\" (both from '76), which are the only post-'60s recordings on CD 1, each appear lodged between tracks from the mid-'60s; \"In My Room\" (from '63) appears on CD 2 between tracks from '67 and '72; and CD 2 opens with \"Kokomo\" (from '88) and closes with \"Good Vibrations\" (from '66)! Probably the best example of strange track placement on this set is \"Kiss Me, Baby\" (on CD 2), a track from '65, which is sandwiched between the 2012 \"reunion\" tracks \"Isn't It Time\" and \"That's Why God Made The Radio\"! The track order here really isn't a major problem, although I can't help wondering just why the songs included on BB comps are almost never in the order that they were released!\nTHE MIXES: Most of the tracks on this set are in stereo; the exceptions are \"Do It Again\" (although, somewhat oddly, that one is in a 2012 stereo mix on the Made In California box set), \"Surfin' Safari,\" \"I Get Around,\" 'The little Girl I Once Knew,\" \"Help Me, Rhonda,\" \"Fun, Fun, Fun\" (those last two are the single versions), and \"Good Vibrations.\" The other tracks are in either their originally-released stereo mixes or in later, more recent stereo mixes. Most of the \"later\" stereo mixes are of songs that weren't originally released in true stereo. Those who may want the original mono mixes of the songs may be disappointed, but since I personally prefer stereo, I appreciate the fact that this set is mostly stereo. However, it seems to me that some of the \"later\" stereo mixes work better than others. I think the least effective one here is the one of \"Do You Wanna Dance\"; it sounds to me like the volume on the lead vocal wavers up and down (or like the vocal, well, \"dances\" from front to back in the mix), and like the guitar solo has been pushed way into the background. I find this disappointing, as I was looking forward to hearing that song in stereo! I like MOST of the mixes here, though.\nSOUND QUALITY: Wow, that's one subjective subject! People don't all have the same ears or the same CD players, and not everyone notices or pays attention to every nuance, so it can be hard if not impossible to really say how the sound of any particular release \"is.\" As for this set, as far as I (as a non-audiophile) am  concerned, the sound quality kind of alternates between being at least acceptable and being very good if not great. I have heard other BB CDs that I think have better overall sound quality, but I still find this set to be quite listenable, or the majority of it anyway.\nOVERALL: I would say that this is a good set. It isn't perfect, at least not in my opinion, but I don't regret buying it! If you're a longtime fan and already have other BB comps and aren't a collector, it may not be needed, but I think it would be a good purchase for people who are less familiar with the group's music and don't have much of it (and who aren't sticklers for great sound quality!).","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Though already covered extensively in rap and hip hop, the principles of knowledge, moral lessons and social activism can never become cliche as long as they are presented and packaged correctly, and as long as they are coming from an individual of character. They are at the core of the culture's goals alongside having a good time, challenging popular thought, and expressing oneself artistically and creatively. Already well experienced in the rap game, Queens, New York emcee Cormega makes effective use of his time by employing these principles in Mega Philosophy, a collaboration album with the legendary Large Professor serving as producer. Cormega is by far more mature than he has ever been. He stresses many points including achieving inner peace through questioning, keeping an open mind, persevering, and taking personal responsibility. In fact the whole album revolves around the theme of maintaining a strong mental state, which is the secret to life. Cormega's smooth flow of intelligent rhymes coupled with the Large Professor's no-frills beats make for classical hip hop listening, and the guest emcees, Redman, AZ, Styles P, Nature, Raekwon, and Black Rob, all contribute very hot, very smart verses. If Mega seems to get redundant, he is only paraphrasing, putting his lessons in other words to get through to his listeners; thus, he never gets dull. Driving his points home in a little more than thirty minutes, he is also concise with no fluff or fillers. Cormega and the Large Professor have not invented any groundbreaking formulas but instead simply combine their talents to make good, authentic hip hop for what might be one of the year's best rap albums.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"The Marvelettes were a female R&B vocal group from Insker, MI who signed on with Berry Gordy's fledgling Motown label in 1961. The group released more than two dozen singles on Motown's subsidiary label Tamla during the 1960's but only five of these records were able to crack the Top 20 nationally on the pop charts. Of these my favorite is \"Don't Mess With Bill\" which was released very late in 1965 and peaked at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February of 1966 and at #3 on the R&B Singles chart.

{"text":"Niell Blomkamps career is quickly garnering criticism similar to that of M. Night Shyamalan's. That he himself is his own worst enemy. District 9 was an amazing directorial effort, but then Elysium and now Chappie seem to be landing with quite a thud. Another alarming thing is he has never quite stuck with one composer. Clinton Shorters District 9 was an obvious The Dark Knight temp mimic. And Ryan Amons effort on Elysium failed to amount to anything (with no fault to Ryan, all blame on Blomkamp). Amon was in fact supposed to be onboard Chappie, but as things happen in Hollywood, Blomkamp somehow managed to snag Hans Zimmer. Zimmer dove right in after Interstellar and crafted a score that is fresh in its own sonic identity but definitely echoes the chaotic shortcomings of another choppy Blomkamp mishap.\n\nBlomkamp is in love with his native Johannesburg, and Zimmer had to enter that gritty and metallic sci-fi world that Blomkamp has created out of his South African hometown. Chappie is a very standard score in terms of structure. We are introduced to the setting and story, we get a theme for Chappie, we follow Chappie on his journey and it comes to an explosive and emotional climax. Very by the books narrative here, which is fine. Heres the good. The score feels as if it was built from the ground up, and it really absorbs you into the soundscape of the narrative. Chappies theme arrives in A Machine That Thinks And Feels. Its a simple theme that sounds like a music box toy or a lullaby. Its childlike only in the sense of its fragility, newness and innocence. Zimmer does a fantastic job crafting action builds later with that theme that echos most of the emotion of the score. And honestly, thats the heart of the score. Chappies theme is the emotional heart. It reminded me very much of New Orders score to the brilliant short film More from Mark Osbourne (whom Hans has scored two films for now, maybe not a coincidence?). Its all about innocence and that drive for happiness.\n\nThe bad here is the pulsing electronic dance style the music takes on. The pulsing loops at times can be abrasive and structured in a way where you want them to stop so you can breath and take in the music. I get that its meant to add a modern vibe and pulsing structure to the action, but it yanks the listener out. Thankfully those loops become a more organic part of the score as the story moves forward and don't feel so artificial. I really liked the final act, it was true to Chappies emotional journey and delivered some great Zimmer moments. While the electronic textures used feel unique, Zimmer fans will notice some Dark Knight Rises elements (including a Bane-like chant) as well as an overall throwback sound that calls back to Thelma & Louise and Black Rain. In the end, the score saves itself from its hairy beginning. This isn't top shelf Zimmer, and I attribute that to a disconnect with Blomkamp who seems to have been given carte blanche too early in his career without fine-tuning his skills as a director.\n\nChappie is a score that may take at least two listens before it grows on you. The pulse-pounding beginning is too abrasive at times, and the mish-mash of electronic textures can get too muddled. Luckily once Chappies theme comes into play the score finds its footing and is able to craft an engaging enough narrative that excites just a tad more than it emotionally resonates. Zimmer with additional composers Steve Mazzaro and Andrew Kawczynski do craft a unique electronic soundscape for Blomkamps Chappie. Sometimes the stylistic approach drowns out the emotional core, but overall its an engaging and satisfying musical narrative by the end of it.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"Over this past weekend I had the opportunity to sample a pretty good chunk of Paul Simons stunning new release Stranger to Stranger on NPRs First Listen website.  As usual, listening to a Paul Simon album proved to be an exciting and mostly joyful experience.  Simon always succeeds in delivering the unexpected as he experiments with an eclectic variety of sounds, genres and instruments. I liked a tune called Wristband right off the bat and was not surprised to learn that it has been chosen as the first single to be released from the album.  One has to marvel how at the age of 74 Simon is not content to rest on his laurels but rather seeks to synthesize seemingly disparate musical forms into highly enjoyable new tunes.  There are a generous 16 tracks on this album and you cannot help but be impressed by the quality of each and every one of these songs.  I especially enjoyed Pauls moving musical tribute to Negro League baseball legend Cool Papa Bell as well as a neat number called The Riverbank.  The disc closes with the very fine duet New York Is My Home featuring fellow New Yorker and rock and roll Hall of Famer Dion.  A very nice touch indeed!\n\nAfter listening to Stranger to Stranger a couple of times it becomes abundantly clear that time has not eroded Paul Simons musical prowess one little bit.  This is an outstanding recording from start to finish and there is little doubt in my mind that it will be another huge success.  While it might not be quite on the level of his masterpiece Graceland this is nonetheless an album that deserves your attention and support.  After all, there are not that many new releases for us aging baby boomers to glom on to these days.  Highly recommended!","classification":5,"fold":4}

I'll admit that her music is overtly cheesy but that is what makes her music more fun to listen to than say Britney Spears who sounds way too much like Alvin and the Chipmunks and just annoys me to no ends of the earth. Granted \"Belive\" was played way too much back when the cd first came out but now I can thoroughly enjoy listening to the hi-nrg sounds of the song. My main problem with the cd is that the material towards the end gets a bit weak and intolerable for me to listen to with the exception of \"Love is the Groove\". That song I dug but I just didn't care for \"Taxi Taxi\" and the dance remix of \"We All Sleep Alone\". Even though I didn't care for those songs, I adored \"The Power\", \"Runaway\", \"Strong Enough\" and \"All or Nothing\" especially. \"All or Nothing\" is my very favorite track off the cd. Cher's vocals couldn't sound any better than they did on this song as well as on this cd. \"Believe\" is a fun album to listen to despite its weak moments. Sure people can mock Cher all they want to but personally I will take her over most of today's pop acts.","classification":4,"fold":4}

It is obvious Prince had an after party mentality for funk on this cd, but somehow he missed the mark.  It is not a horrible cd it just does not make you ever feel like dancing or caring to play that one song over and over.  Some of the guitar rifts are excellent though.\nOkay after two weeks of listening to the cd I can ease up a bit and say here are the best songs on the albums to me rated 1-10.\nHere- I give a number 7.  I really liked this song but it took a while to grow on me. It really wasn't till I listened to the lyrics clearly. I listened to this song more than any other.  It has a carousel feel to it sorta of like Dionne from The Truth Cd's but in lyrics it's more reminiscent to The Dance on 3121 and Strange Relationship from SOTT)\nDance For Me-I give a number 6(Reminiscent of 319 off Gold but a little better b\/c).  His voice sticks in your head and I like the beat. This is a good Prince song.\nU're Gonna C Me- I say it's a 9 but we've already heard this so I give it a 7.6.  (I have to lower the number for remixes b\/c imagine anyone else redoing a song of their own and putting it on an album)\nChocolate Box-I give a 5.  I would give a 6 but it sounds like it should be played in a gay bar and I'm a man so I can only dig it but so far. His voice sticks in your head with this song. If he came out with this in the 80's it woulda been a hit but it's 2009.\nCrimson and Clover-I give a 4 just because I can and if you're Prince and you're gonna do a cover song it has to be great, but that guitar rift bumps it up to a 5.\n$- I give a 5.  Definitely reminiscent of MovieStar off Crystal Ball.\n77 Beverly Park- I give an eight.  It's only an instrumental though, but it's probably the best song on the 2 cd's.\nColonized Mind-I give a 4 compared to Money Don't Matter, SOTT,  When Will We Be Paid, Avalanche,Planet Earth, and his other political songs. He does have a couple lines in this song worth being heard though and the comparisons of a child with no mother equals a man with no feeling make you think.\nOverall this cd is okay.  Even with his funny electro voice it just didn't do it. Like everyone we all expect a lot out of Prince while at the same time trying to lower our expectations, but this cd is just okay.  I can think of too many of his other cd's that are far better but he does have a couple songs that are catchy.  He definitely caught a vibe on this cd, it's just I didn't catch it.  Like I said, it sounds like takes from an afterparty or a B-sides cd. It did not feel like an album.  By this I mean think Dave Chappelle's sketches compared to his stand up or a television show compared to a movie.  I feel like he wanted to be funky on this cd and it came across but it just wasn't stankonia.","classification":2,"fold":4}

{"text":"Rick Springfield had his work cut out for him. After releasing arguably one of the best (if not THE best) albums of his career with 2008's VENUS IN OVERDRIVE, he had to either A) up his game BIG TIME, or B) possibly suffer a latter-day sophomore slump.\n  Sadly, in the end, it's slightly more B than A. It's not that SONGS FOR THE END OF THE WORLD is a bad album...quite the contrary. Parts of the disc really do grow on you with repeated listens. It's just that it doesn't have the focus\/sharpness\/ease that graced VENUS.\n  In addition, there are times when the album is just downright noisy. This growing need that many aging rockers seem to have to prove that they can still ROCK is some what frustrating...we KNOW you can do it, so just DO it! After all these years, there's nothing to prove...rock is as much attitude as it is loudness, and attitude equals heart. (This quirky syndrome affected, among others, parts of the new Heart album as well).\n  A prime example of this trend is the opening track, \"Wide Awake.\" There's so much going on in this bloated, over-the-top mess that nothing sticks. The frantic arrangement just seems chaotic, while the lyrics come across as shallow and amateurish. The lead vocal is decent enough, but it just gets lost under the weight of the rest of the track.\n  Far better is \"Our Ship's Sinking.\" Everything is turned up to 11 here, but there's still a strong sense of melody and structure. Things ebb and flow, building and receding. Springfield's lead vocal is as full of heart as it is attitude, making this a TRUE rocker. This track should have opened the album.\n  \"I Hate Myself\" is my favorite cut for one reason...on this infectious rave-up, Springfield brilliantly blends the strongest moments of his poppier past with gutsy rock, resulting in an absolute gem. Toss in a killer lead vocal ~ how can you NOT love the high note in \"Soooon!\"? ~ and you have one of Springfield's best songs to date.\n  \"You And Me\" is a mid-tempo rocker that's delivered from the heart....and the soul. Springfield's honest, sincere lead vocal dances over the simple, yet powerful, arrangement, resulting in a romantic masterpiece. (When he sings \"And all the world will burn\", you know these two will be O.K.).\n  As strong as \"Gabriel\" is, I wish they had stayed with just the acoustic guitars and keyboards that open the cut....they perfectly cushion Springfield's shimmering lead vocal. There's absolutely no reason they needed to add electric guitars and drums to this track....it would have been perfect without them, showing a very different side to Springfield. Very good...could have been great.\n  \"A Sign Of Life\" isn't as bad as \"Wide Awake\" ~ it at least has a semblance of structure and a melody ~ but it still suffers from the same hollow, by-the-numbers vibe of the earlier cut. At this point in his career, Springfield can't be wasting time on songs that go nowhere, which is exactly what happens here.\n  \"My Last Heartbeat\" has some strong lyrical content (\"There's a hole in my soul\/Where the love leaks out\/A shadow in my heart\/That's filled with doubt\/A devil on my back\/I can hear him shout\/'Let me in! Let me in'\"), but it all sinks under the heft of the arrangement and the strained lead vocal. Once again, too too much.\n  \"Joshua\" is another wonderful example of that perfect blend of pop and rock. The track totally kicks out the jams, but it never once loses touch with it's melodic, tuneful core. Springfield's spirited lead vocal bobs and weaves between the lyrics, delivering a touching story of support, belief in someone, and, most importantly, love. Very nice.\n  \"Love Screws Me Up\" is my other favorite track. A buoyant arrangement (love the Stones-flavored guitars!), an almost giddy lead vocal and the spirited \"la la\" backing vocals all come together perfectly. Toss in some great lyrics ~ \"I watch my heart\/In your delicate hand\/Slammed against my kitchen wall\/It bursts like a bubble\" ~ and you have pop perfection!\n  I'd have to call \"I Found You\" a draw...on the one hand, it sports a spot-on vocal and some strong lyrical imagry (\"And then you made flowers from hurricanes\"), but there's just something about the arrangement that seems....overdone. This is another one of those \"kitchen sink\" songs. (In retrospect, a lot of SFTEOTW would've benefited from the old \"Less is more\" adage). Another \"Nice, but could've been better\" cut.\n  I don't want to sound like a broken record, but \"Depravity\" is another track that just doesn't go anywhere....well, no where besides backwards. This cut is like a bad 80's flashback. Another miss. (The repeated spelling of the title is particularly annoying).\n  The disc ends on a strong note, chugging along with the clear-eyed, focused \"One Way Street.\" The arrangement is crisp and economical, the vocal energetic and sincere. Granted, the lyrics get a little cliched (\"Love is never a one way street\"), but, overall, this is a pretty memorable way to close things out.\n  So, the million dollar question is....where does Rick Springfield go from here? Was VENUS IN OVERDRIVE a fluke? Or is SONGS FOR THE END OF THE WORLD just the minor stumble? In either case, I will be here for the next chapter! (As with all my reviews, I'm docking the disc half a star for not including the lyrics).","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"I thought I was getting the original recording or a live performance very similar to it.  It was neither.  After you've sung a song hundreds of times, you can get a little loopy.  Still a great song that I've sung for audiences myself, but this particular recording....not so good.","classification":3,"fold":4}
{"text":"good music","classification":5,"fold":4}
{"text":"There certainly are some frustrations with this set of music. It merits five stars based on the music and the extreme bargain price of two dollars at the time of this writing. But I docked a star for the sheer pain in the neck posed by trying to figure out what exactly is in this set, given a lot of sloppiness in the artist credits.\n\nFirst off, throw out the artist credits for all three of the piano concertos -- they are all at least partly wrong. The set starts out with Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No. 3, credited to \"Albert Coates, Leopold Stokowski, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Vladimir Horowitz\". This is actually the debut 1930 recording of this concerto with Coates conducting the London Symphony Orchestra and Horowitz as soloist.\n\nConcerto No. 2 is credited to \"Albert Coates, Leopold Stokowski, Vladimir Horowitz\", but it is actually the 1929 recording with Leopold Stokowski conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra and Rachmaninov (not Horowitz) as soloist. (Thanks to Neil Brennan, as always, for pointing out that this is in fact the 1929 electric recording, rather than the 1924 acoustic recording as I had originally mentioned.)\n\nBoth these extremely old recordings capture fine performances, especially the Horowitz 1930. I did not have either of these recordings previously and am amazed at how well they have been cleaned up. Still, these are recordings from the dawn of the classical recording era and so they are very far indeed from modern sound quality. Some people find no joy in listening to old recordings like this due to the sound. I not one of those people, but if you are, you definitely won't care for these tracks.\n\nPiano Concerto No. 1 is a real gem -- a live concert recording from 1969 by the great Sviatoslav Richter on piano playing with the USSR State Symphony Orchestra under conductor Oleg Agarkov. It is incorrectly credited to \"Aleg Agarkov, Kiril Kondrashin, Sviatoslav Richter\". The sound on this one is very good, but it is still a 1960s Soviet live recording. There is some crowd and other noise, but the performance shines through -- really outstanding job by Richter.\n\nThere is a final problem with the credits on tracks 85-98, which are all ascribed to \"Alexander Ghindin, Michael Ponti, Robert Groslot\" -- ridiculous since these are all works for solo piano. For what it's worth, these selections appear to exactly reflect the contents of Disc 5 of Brilliant's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Rachmaninoff-Complete-Piano-Works\/dp\/B003XKDEV6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rachmaninoff: Complete Piano Works<\/a>. I cannot completely confirm who performs what, but a little digging has led me to these strong suspicions: 1) Alexander Ghindin on \"Moments Musicaux\", 2) \"Morceaux de Salon\" appear to be from Micheal Ponti (from his&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/set-of-the-complete-works-of-Rachmaninov-on-the-VOX-label\/dp\/B00581CN3I\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">set of the complete works of Rachmaninov on the VOX label<\/a>), and 3) the Franz Behr transcription \"Polka de W.R.\" by Robert Groslot.\n\nBut there is still a lot more. The Opus 33 and 39 \"Etudes-Tableux\" are here -- except for No. 1 from the Op. 39 set (a silly omission, I have no idea why). They are ably performed by Russian pianist Nikolai Lugansky, a professor at the Moscow conservatory and a serious interpreter of Rachmaninov.\n\nFinally, the real gem of the set is the very broad selection of solo piano works performed by the Cuban-American pianist Santiago Rodriguez -- who has earned a very deserved reputation an outstanding Rachmaninov interpreter. These are first-rate performances, world class. I'm amazed that a very good portion of Rachmaninov's meatiest work for solo piano is showcased here in Mr. Rodriguez's performances:\n- Both Piano Sonatas\n- The complete Op. 23 and 32 Preludes\n- All three early nocturnes (Rodriguez has caught some flack for adding and end to the unfinished final nocturne, though)\n- Song without words\n- Morceaux de Fantasie, Op. 3\n- A couple of selections from Variations on a Theme of Corelli (which has 20 sections in all)\n\nBitrates are variable and range from a somewhat low 146 kbps on average (surprisingly, on the Richter concerto, which sounded OK to me) to a very respectable 254 kbps on average. Total download size is 617 MB for over six and a half hours of very good Rachmaninov.\n\nThe Rodriguez performances alone are a fantastic draw and are worth far more than the total cost of the set. Jump on this while you can and try not to get too upset about the faulty metadata.","classification":4,"fold":4}

The song is one we've heard a million times before, when your lover is gone, you're sad, yes, we know, we get the picture. Stick to being in love with the boyfriend, or hating him, or being jealous over him, or losing him, just not, pining over him being more than ten feet away from you. And good gosh, can this song be any more overplayed on the radio? I mean, if this and \"Keep Holding On\" were the only songs you knew of her, you'd think she's the worst artist since SoljaBoy.\n\nAnd read my review of \"Keep Holding On,\" most of it also applies here.

{"text":"Amy Winehouse: when you have a name like that, it seems that you just HAVE to get into the entertainment business (yes, that's her real name). Although she released a critically acclaimed album back in 2003, I never heard of her until \"Rehab\" was all over the place this year. So in contrast to her father-in-law's advice (for those that don't know, he advised people not to buy the album in order to convince Amy and her husband to stop abusing drugs), I finally picked up Back to Black, and I don't plan on putting it down any time soon.\n\nThere are plenty of highlights, like \"Love Is a Losing Game\", \"He Can Only Hold Her\" and \"Wake Up Alone\". And aside from her vocals, Amy also has a certain creativity in her lyrics: check \"Some Unholy War\" or \"Just Friends\" for proof of this. And you should already know how great \"Rehab\" and \"You Know I'm No Good\" are.\n\nSpeaking of that song though, the reason why I knocked off half a star is because at the end of the album there is a \"remix\" of it featuring Ghostface Killah, and it's really one of those pointless remixes whose only real difference is a rap in the middle of the song; also, although Ghost's rap is good, it gets unnecessarily loud toward the end. But despite Back to Black barely being over half an hour long, it's still classic material, so if you don't have it yet, WTF are you sittin' around for? Pick it up!\n\nAnthony Rupert","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"On one of his new songs, \"Never Get You Right\", Flowers sings \"....it's a coin toss\".  While he's not speaking about his record, he could easily being doing just that.\n\nAs I had pre-ordered 'the Desired Effect', about one song per week has been released to me. I had 40% of the album in my \"hands\" well before the actual album release date, but that came with very mixed results.\n\nI am still finding \"Can't Deny My Love\" to be my favourite song of 2015. I would expect that to change as the year went on, but he could surprise me.  It will be in the top 5 for sure.\n\nThe following two songs sent pre-release were a disappointment. \"Still Want You\" is the antithesis of \"Can't Deny My Love\".  It. Is. Horrible.  Just one of the worst songs ever, let alone his. I can't imagine that Flowers and his producer sat around the studio afterwards, going \"man, this is really good!!\"\n\n\"Lonely Town\".  Meh.  Like a lot of songs by the Killers, it has an 80's vibe, but this one isn't a good vibe. The keyboards are bordering on DeBarge and Nu Shooz territory - and there is no way that some of the vocals (at the 0:59 mark) don't sound exactly like the lead singer from a little known group - Cock Robin.\n\nFlowers covered his 'lonely town' laments much better in his last solo release with \"Playing with Fire\". We get it - being a Mormon in a small town wasn't ideal for you. The crass auto-tune moment does nothing to help the cause. Even if he changed these elements, the lyrics are way more repetitive than most of his songs.\n\nWith \"I Can Change\", we get redemption. While more than a little sampling Bronski Beat's \"Smalltown Boy\", Flowers makes the song work to great effect. I like the vocal arrangement, I like the chorus more than the verse, but that works too. The song abruptly drops off, for a very weird transition, yet it kind of still works on that level as well.\n\nThe rest of the six songs are like the first four: hit and miss. None of the 'hit' truly rises to the heights of \"Can't Deny My Love\" or \"I Can Change\". A few try. And none of the 'miss' are as bad as \"Lonely Town\" or  \"Still Want You\".\n\n\"Dreams Come True\" and \"Between Me and You\" have a 'Sam's Town' quality, but more like a song that didn't make the cut to that album. And the title in \"Dreams Come True\" is repeated far too often. But when he opens up like at the 1:10 mark in \"Dreams\", he is golden. The problem is, Flowers doesn't do this far enough or for long enough.\n\nUnlike his last solo disk, Flamingo, Flowers seems to strive to sound more Killers-like (\"Digging Up the Heart\", \"Never Get You Right\" and \"Untangled Love\").  Some of this works well - like \"Untangled Love\", but some of it I think would have been in better hands with the band. I don't think it is coincidental that \"Untangled Love\" features the Killer's drummer.\n\nI can certainly do without \"the Way It's Always Been\".\n\nI've said it before with other artists, and will no doubt say it again:  an artists will be remembered for the great songs and the awful ones. It's the mediocre that drowns you - the songs no one will ever remember - and when you only have 10 songs on a disk and 3-4 of them fall into that category, it weighs the entire album down.\n\nFlowers is capable of so much more, but he's not producing it here.","classification":3,"fold":4}
{"text":"Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell are perfect  duet partmers. Each song communicates a different aspect of human emotion. My two favorite songs are \"Hanging Up My Heart\" and \"Open Season On My Heart\". The first song is a rather pleasant country song about being heart broken. It features great steel guitar playing. \"Open Season On My Heart\" is also about feeling heart broken, but the tone is much slower and sad.  I can feel the pain in Rodney  Crowell's voice on this song.  I love the song.\"Black Caffeine\". It is a bluesy country song.  I can relate to the lyrics because of my personal addiction to caffeine in all forms. \"Bull Rider\" is a song about taking life by the horns and hanging on for the ride.  I love the fiddle playing on this track. \"Spanish Dancer\" is not a country song.  This song was written by Patti Scialfa.  She is known for writing rock and pop songs.  The musical arrangements with the accordion and acoustic guitar make this song definitely country though.  This song is about falling in love with a male Spanish dancer.  Emmy Lou sings about being smitten by this man's charms so well on this song. \"Bluebird Wine\" is a song that spark my interest simply because I did not know that such a drink existed. This song makes me want to drink some.  Maybe I can be happy like Rodney Crowell after drinking some bluebird wine. \"Back When We Were Beautiful\" and \"Old Yellow Moon\" are two songs that touch my heart. \"Old Yellow Moon\" is a superb duet album.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Lenny Kravitz rocks.  Ladies love him, guys want to be him, and he is the parent to rock and rolls most indulgent sub-genres. Face it, he's got it. Looking back on the last Kravitz album I bought, also his last album prior to IT IS TIME FOR A LOVE REVOLUTION (BAPTISM), it wasn't Lenny Kravitz at his very best.  Sure tunes like \"Sistamamalover\" and \"Why Are We Running\" were genuine Kravitz, the album was more filler than substance. IT IS TIME FOR A LOVE REVOLUTION is the exact opposite; Kravitz is at his very best performing tunes the caliber of \"American Woman\" and \"Where Are You Gonna Go?\".  First single \"I'll Be Waiting\" proves that the real Lenny Kravitz is back with a vengeance.\n\n\"Love Revolution\" starts the album off right with Kravitz's signature old school, 1970s Traditional rock and roll feel. There's nothing flashy about the songwriting or even Kravitz's performance, but it is a solid track and a standout amongst an album absent of true filler.  \"Bring It On\" isn't as strong as \"Love Revolution\", but it does feature some great guitar playing from Kravitz, which is one of Lenny's great strengths.  \"Good Morning\" features more old-school rock and roll vibes, but it feels fresh for whatever reason. Kravitz sounds top notch here and the lazy groove is perfect.  \"Love, Love, Love\" is the fourth straight consistent track.  4\/4 is pretty damn good right? It only gets better.\n\n\"If You Want It\" has a killer rock refrain that would make any 70s rock male\/band smile, while killer first single \"I'll Be Waiting\" feels perfect in every way. While \"I'll Be Waiting\" should feel dated, it doesn't in the least sense - the string laden ballad easily fits into 2008. What's even better is that \"I'll Be Waiting\" trumps BAPTISM's flat ballad, \"Calling All Angels\" by a mile.  You feel that Kravitz is more pumped up on this album. On \"Will You Marry Me\", Kravitz is influenced by the work of legends Prince and perhaps even Morris Day.  His funk-rock ruminations are some of the most creative I've seen from Kravitz which should clearly transfer not only to white audiences, but more urban audiences.\n\n\"I Love The Rain\" is another soulful-slow jam, while none can deny the emotion of the fantastic \"A Long And Sad Goodbye\" in which Lenny screams \"papa...\".  \"Dancin' Till Dawn\" would be at home on any Prince album just like \"Will You Marry Me\" and maybe my very favorite (other than \"I'll Be Waiting\") of LOVE REVOLUTION. \"A Moment Is All There Is\" as well as \"A New Door\" are both strong and consisten as well.  \"Back in Vietnam\" isn't bad, but doesn't shine as much as the very best.  \"I Want To Go Home\" uses the usual \"Kravitz chordal progression\" as its basis, and it works out good, if not great.\n\nOverall, Kravitz has released his strongest body of work in sometime and the numbers seem to be on his side as well as the album debuted at #4, his highest peak for a studio Album (only his GREATEST HITS bowed better). 4 stars from my perspective.","classification":4,"fold":4}

But wait-- there's more!!

{"text":"\"Bridge to Vallabha,\" a collection of eleven sacred songs and mantras, is the fifth recording from singer-songwriter, instrumentalist, sound engineer, and producer Tina Malia. Considered a visionary in the world, dream pop and sacred chant musical communities, Malias voice is warm, clear and lyrical. The songs are sung in a variety of languages from around the world including Sanskrit, Hebrew, Gurmukhi, and English, but Malia communicates from the heart no matter which language she is singing.  Classically-trained as a child, Malia discovered many female folk singers in her mid-teens when she started writing her own music. After the release of her first album, \"Shores of Avalon,\" Malia met pioneering world chant artist Jai Uttal, who recruited her to sing in his Pagan Love Orchestra. He also introduced her to the rich spiritual tradition of Sanskrit mantras. Malias love of mantra is reflected on her 2005 album, Jaya Bhagavan, as well as on this new release. Her voice is the lead instrument on all of the tracks, accompanied by nylon string guitar, Rhodes piano, charangon, vibraphone, lap steel guitar, and\/or cello. Singers Donna DeLory, Heather Wertheimer of Shantala, Karnamrita Das, Jai-Jagdeesh, Peia and Sasha Rose lend their talents to the mix as do Grammy nominated pianist Peter Kater and cellist Hans Christian. All of the songs are smooth, peaceful, and soothing and Malias gentle voice is hypnotic. Bridge to Vallabha  is a beautiful album whether you use mantras in your daily life or simply enjoy relaxing, heartfelt music. Check it out!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I did not react too good to Bob Dylan as Sinatra-like crooner, although I gave it a shot as I like to think of myself as musically open minded. I've kind of worked backwards with his most recent trilogy, starting with Triplicate, and then moving on to Fallen Angels. Finally, I recently made it to the first album in the trilogy, Shadows in the Night. What at first seemed odd, out of place and wrong, now seems so perfectly right. I just didn't like Dylan in this guise because his voice it seems was always suited to raspy, bluesy, earthy rock numbers. His unique voice is perfect for that. But not for the Great American Songbook material he's been doing recently. I thought (perhaps mistakenly) that you needed a pure, beautiful, golden, old fashioned crooner voice to do this stuff justice. You know, Sinatra, Dino, Ella, Bing, Judy, and the Divine Sarah. Dylan's voice would seem out of place here, and he does sort of miss the notes in a way that sounds like someone who can barely sing. But I kind of knew that if I gave these recordings more time and listening space, I might be able to get them. And I was right, big time.\n  Dylan uses his ragged and torn voice to not just caress these tunes, but inhabit them. Get into their very fiber and core. Find out what makes them tick, and then recreate them all over. And you can have the most ripped up voice in the world and still make these songs magnificent. It takes two things: genius and care. Bob certainly has the genius, and after good, hard listening you see he really cares about this music deeply. It's not a sort of \"Oh this worked great for Rod Stewart so I'll try it too\" thing. Rod has the fantastic voice but just doesn't seem to care much in the music. Dylan knocks it out of the park. I am constantly amazed when an album by Bob that I didn't seem to get and thought was subpar or terrible, turns out to be, after time and care, really good if not really great. Chalk Shadows in the Night up on that very long list.\n  You don't see musicians like this come along every day, and Dylan's like won't be seen again for maybe a hundred years or more. If ever. So this is precious stuff. Pick it up and swim in it's melancholy. It's worth it.----------PEACE","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"I've been waiting almost two decades for this, and I couldn't be happier with the final product. When Failure toured in 2014, I considered myself pretty darn lucky to see them. I never really expected new music though. But the boys came through, and they did it in big fashion.\n\nThis album could very much be viewed as an immediate follow-up to Fantastic Planet. The production is a bit more polished, but much of the songwriting comes off in a similar vein. But it's certainly not a copycat album or even some attempt to recapture old magic. No, the magic here comes naturally. It's an album that is epic in scope and unravels beautifully throughout.\n\nThroughout the album, the band shows maturity while occasionally giving a nod to their old (or should I say young) selves. The Segues are beautiful and show the band could easily become a post-rock powerhouse if they wanted. But there's plenty of that old space rock here too, such as \"Hot Traveler.\"\n\nSurprisingly, I've heard some negative criticism about \"Mulholland Dr,\" which is one of my favorite tracks on the album. It's a bit classic rock, but it also reminds me of \"The Nurse Who Loved Me\" and a few other songs from Fantastic Planet. It's a magnificent piece of songwriting that fits well on this album.\n\nI'm certainly not ready to proclaim this better than Fantastic Planet, but it definitely is a worthy successor. I think it's much better than any of us could have really expected after this long. 2015 has already been a great year for the comeback album, and Failure has made it even more of a success!","classification":5,"fold":4}

They have made many great songs after all this time, that still sound better than all the joke songs that have been on radio. When it also has came down to covers, they still are just remarkable after all this time, and their rendition of Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes If You Don't Know Me By Now still is one of those songs that still gets me in the heart.

{"text":"It was B.O.B's mega hit \"Nothin on You\" where I was first introduced to the incredibly gifted Bruno Mars. The hook he sung made a lasting impression... On Doo-Wops and Hooligans, Bruno shows the world not only his incredible vocal range but the strength of his song-writting and versatility as a muscian. He plays most of the instruments himself.\n\nThe result: Ten great songs with at least three sure fire hit singles. Those being the current r'n'b flavored hit \"Just the Way you are\", \"Grenade\" (his latest release) and \"Count on Me.\" There are even two collaborations. One a reggae styled duet with Damien Marley and the other with Cee Lo and B.O.B\n\nIf you love Usher, Outkast, John Legend then pick this cd up. Bruno's voice and style is totally unique. You can't put it into any one box. Here's hoping that this is the first of many cds in a long and promising career...\n\nThe one regret: at 35 minutes, the album is far too short. Why not have included \"Somewhere in Brookyn\" or even a second remix of \"Just the Way you are\"?\n\nUPDATE: Since my initial review Amazon now sells the SPECIAL EDITION CD which is called the Oz or Australian Tour version. It contains the same bonus tracks featured on the Japan-only release.\nHere you have all 10 of the original tracks plus the following 6 bonus ones. These being:\n1- Just the way you are (remix ft. Lupe Fiasco)\n2- Somewhere in Brooklyn (previously only available as a digital download)\n3- Talking to the moon (acoustic piano version)\n4 - Just the way you are (Walmart Soundcheck version that was recorded in front of a select audience in Las Vegas)\n5 - Grenade (Walmart Soundtrack version also from Las Vegas)\n6 - The other side (Walmart Soundtrack version live from Las Vegas)\n\nThe live tracks illustrate just what a talented singer and band Bruno has and will bring a great smile to you upon listening to them. I know that the price is a bit steep but for you diehards this is the definitive version of Bruno's multi-platinum debut album!\nI can hardly wait for his latest single \"It will rain\" that is slated to be on the Twillight's Breaking Dawn soundtrack slated for release this November.","classification":4,"fold":4}

I particularly like the guitar riff that periodically comes into play.  The group does a great job of combining the instrumental background with the words (not a lot of different words, and no heavy thoughts here), but pleasant and catchy.  It's the kind of sound that if you are not careful you will be playing it back in your head as it tends to kind of stick in your mind (especially the guitar riff).  I heard it last night for the first time in ages (on satellite sirius radio) and knew I had to have it right then.  This is a song you will either want right away or decide it isn't your cup of tea.

{"text":"While this is obviously a Christmas album, it contains a few songs that you wouldn't necessarily expect to find on such an album. Nevertheless, Susan seems to have known what she was doing in selecting those songs as they sit comfortably alongside the Christmas classic. The mood and tempo is mellow, just like her debut album.\n\nThe Christmas songs do not include a reprise of Silent night (featured on her debut album) but include four other well-worn carols - The first Noel, O holy night, Away in a manger and O come all ye faithful. Susan sings all four superbly as you would expect, always sticking to the traditional arrangement. Anybody who has heard Susan sing and who is also familiar with these songs (that's most if not all of the people who ever read this review) will know exactly what to expect. Another well-worn classic, though more for New Year than Christmas, is Auld lang syne. My only regret here is that it was included as the penultimate track rather than being the closing track. Still, that's a minor quibble. Among the Christmas songs, the most interesting from my perspective is Do you hear what I hear? Not only is it less familiar than the four carols (though I've heard a fair number of versions even of this song) but it is here by Susan and Amber Stassi. I don't think I've ever heard it sung as a duet before, but it works well.\n\nThe other songs include Perfect day (a cover of Lou Reed's classic song), Hallelujah (a cover of one of Leonard Cohen's songs, that may at first glance seem a bit depressing for a Christmas album, but it`s OK by me), Don't dream it's over (a cover of a Crowded House song, which Susan included to put people in a party mood, but it is mellow just like the rest of the album) and Make me a channel of your peace, which is a hymn based on the prayer of St Francis of Assisi. A closer comparison of the lyrics shows that it only uses some of the prayer. Those of you who remember Margaret Thatcher's first election victory in 1979 may recall that also quoted from the same prayer (and people will have their own opinions as to whether she lived up to her quote or not) but she quoted partly from different parts of the prayer.\n\nThe inclusion of some unusual selections make this a more interesting album than if she'd stuck to repertoire of obvious Christmas classics throughout. It is a great mellow Christmas album, ideally suited to those quieter moments during the festive season.","classification":5,"fold":4}

This collection, though, actually makes sense.\n\nThe album focuses on 1988-1990, when the group found a home on Peter Baumann's Private Music label, which was located on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. Though it leans heavily on the album entitled Melrose, there is a flow to the numbers that brings a new focus to this period of the band's lengthy career.\n\nThis is a great walk down Melrose Avenue, as a former band member gave the group the flexibility to focus on the art of creating music.","classification":4,"fold":4}

It's when the singer is trying so hard to convince you that he's a mack with the ladies, that he just comes off as desperate (Any song by Ray J falls into this category).  After a series of lady-friendly, energetic songs, Jason Derule has has apparently decided to try to be raunchy and tap into his inner R. Kelly.  Alas, he does come off a lot more like Ray J.  First there was \"Talk Dirty To Me\", now there is this phonic embarrassment, \"Wiggle\".\n\n  \"Wiggle\" tries to use the raunchy flute work of many similar songs and Jason tries to go on and on about how he wants to see that lady work it.  But, the flute sounds more like the cheap plastic recorders elementary school kids used and Derulo sounds more like a guy standing on the sideline try learn how to get raunchy with the ladies while watching other, more skilled players, do their thing.\n\n  Derulo would be better served by going back to romancing the ladies from his earlier music.","classification":1,"fold":4}

Roger has always had lots to say and was not afraid to put it to music.  Lets talk about the music here, 54 minutes of some really outstanding songs.\n\nWe need to remember this man made up 25%  of one of the greatest musical groups of our generation!  Pink Floyd, there has never been a group that is in the same league as these guys were and there never will be!\n\nRoger Waters is like a fine wine, he gets better with age.  The sound effects, and all of the voices and talking between the songs is so Pink Floyd.  The  music flows in a very dreamy,  Pink Floyd style.  In June 2017 it almost seems like I am listening to a brand new Floyd release!  However, I do miss  David Gilmour's  signature guitar sounds!\n\nIf you are a fan of Roger Waters or of Pink Floyd you need to buy this at once!  This is great music to enjoy,  I cannot stop listening to it, very addicting!  There will be no Pink Floyd reunion soon, Roger Waters or David Gilmour solo releases are all were gonna get so enjoy!!\n\nRemember, Mr. Waters is a musical legend!!  Let him speak his opinions whether you agree with him or not.  Please enjoy this for what it is, 54 minutes of some of the greatest music I have heard in 2017!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I been a fan of Korn since Issues came out in 1999 its the first CD of Korn I purchased. Korn III: Remember Who You Are is really a disappointed in an album from Korn, it reminds me alot of their 2003 album \"Take A Look In The Mirror\" which featured the original lineup before Brian \"Head\" Welch and David Salvia left the band. I will give Munky, Fieldy, Jonathan Davis, and Ray Luzier create for trying make the sound of the earlier albums along with Ross Robinson returning to produce the album after being gone since the bands Life is Peachy album which is the last album he produced with the band. It is no way a return to the earlier sound of Korn though in a few tracks you can hear a few nods to Korn's earlier albums. I think alot of songs could use more work in them as I came away kinds not impressed with the album. I am not a huge fan of Korn by the way kinda of a follower of Korn but not a die hard fan. Issues got me into them and I avoided their recent albums Untitled and See You On The Other Side after Brian left the band. I really think the band should continue if that what makes them happy though most will say that the band is done with. They really could build on the sound of Korn for the next album if they chose to. Not a bad album by any means just not what die hard fans would want in a Korn album. If you want the older sound then listen to Issues, Life is Peachy, Korn, etc. Or listen to Heads album Save Me From Myself if you want the missing sound of Korn. Also Jonathan's whinny sound needs to stop, i know its what fans love but its way overdone and Korn should probably go in a different direction. It was great 15 years and I understand is but fans love about Korn but I really don't need it now when the guys are in their 40's with families and really successful in life.","classification":2,"fold":4}

This great CD is produced by the legendary Rick Rubin (Neil Diamond, Metallica, etc) & mixed by Allen Sides & Scheps : perhaps an indication for the 'departure\/exploration' in this new album. The album opens with a great instrumental, \"The Wandering Kind(Prelude)\" : great violin & guitar combination song. The next 3 tracks, \"Bells Of New York City\", \"Galileo(Someone Like You)\" & \"L'ora Dell'addio\" are great 'classical music' tracks. \"Hidden Away\" is great track with great vocals by Josh Groban (JG) & beautiful melody. \"Au Jardin De Sans - Pourquoi\" is another great 'classical music' track. \"Higher Window\" is a great track : great acouistic guitar & amazing vocals by JG. \"If I Walk Away\" is a great track : great Spanish guitar & great vocals by JG. \"Love Only Knows\" is another great track with great guitar & vocals. \"Voce' Existe Em Mim\" is a solid track\/gem : great drum & violin combination with great 'racy' vocals. \"Wait At Home\" is a great, slow orchestral track with great vocal 'entrance' at the start of the song. \"London Hymn\" is a okay orchestral\/choir song, The closing track, \"Straight To You\" is a solid track\/gem : beautiful music & great vocals. This is my favourite track from this rather 'departure album' by Josh Groban & hence the title of my review, \"Straight To You\".

He honestly has been known for R&B in so many hits with The Drifters, but honestly there is only one song that everyone really knows him for, Stand By Me.

{"text":"The folks over at The Bach Guild division of eOne Music have outdone themselves this time to celebrate Beethoven's birthday in 2012. (Actually, December 17 was the date of his baptism, as his birthdate is uncertain -- but who's counting?).\n\nThis collection from the vaults of Vanguard Records is sure to please. It is full of both familiar \"greatest hits\" -- mainly in the symphonies and piano sonatas -- as well as delicious Beethoven rarities and pieces off the beaten track that even people with serious classical music collections will no doubt be dying to hear.\n\nThe highlight of the set for me is the collection of Piano Sonatas performed by Bruce Hungerford, a remarkable pianist who died in a tragic accident in 1977, before he could finish his recordings of the complete Beethoven sonatas for Vanguard. What he did complete is an amazing legacy of powerful, expressive performances that rank among the best recorded. (For a previous release of these recordings, see&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/here\/dp\/B0000023BX\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">here<\/a>.)\n\nThen we have the late string quartets performed by the Yale String Quartet. Again, amazing performances that were certainly among the best available when recorded in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and still just as satisfying. Fantastic in sound and performance quality. Their \"Grosse Fuge\" -- which in my mind counts as the first place \"modern\" classical music made a stand, almost 90 years before Stravinsky's \"Rite of Spring\" -- is amazingly fluid and really must be heard. The Yale Quartet gives the late quartets emotional and musical depth on par with anyone -- these performances stand the test of time. (See one of the previous releases of this music&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/here\/dp\/B0000023BV\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">here<\/a>.)\n\nFor me the biggest surprise in this set were the performances of Symphonies 3 and 5-7 with Sir Adrian Boult conducting the Philharmonic Promenade Orchestra of London (a precursor to the National Philharmonic Orchestra) in his later years. I wasn't expecting much from these. Boult was the ultimate interpreter of British music from the early 20th century, and I will always treasure his first cycle of Vaughan Williams' symphonies greatly, but Beethoven? I assumed these would be dull, but my goodness, I was very wrong. These are dramatic performances, recorded in beautiful, rich detail and terrific early stereo. (An earlier release of this material is found&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/here\/dp\/B0000023B1\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">here<\/a>-- perhaps credited to the London Philharmonic because the \"Promenade Orchestra\" at the time was made up mostly of London Phil players.)\n\nAnother set of jewels are the complete set of Cello Sonatas performed by Antonio Janigro and Jorg Demus. Wonderful classic performances that again, simply should not be missed. (See an older release&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/here\/dp\/B0000CABII\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">here<\/a>.)\n\nThen we have two relatively seldom-heard full-length Beethoven works -- the full ballet of \"The Creatures of Prometheus\" and the complete incidental music to \"Egmont\", both of which are usually heard for the overtures only. Both performances are by the Utah Symphony under its great long-time conductor, Maurice Abravanel. Sadly I have to admit I hadn't paid much attention to either piece in its full length before, and I'm very pleased to have these recordings now. (See the LP releases for these&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/here\/dp\/B00125K3OA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">here<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/here\/dp\/B008FES20S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">here<\/a>.)\n\nTo round things out, we have a further assortment of pieces for solo piano performed by Denis Mathews and Jorg Demus. The Demus recordings are general some bagatelles and simpler pieces, certainly simpler than the Sonatas performed by Hungerford. Denis Mathews offers a smorgasbord of variation pieces. The sound suffers somewhat in these sections, but enjoyable all.\n\nOverall, this is an amazing set that outshines, in my view, the previous \"Big Box\" sets eOne has previously released, impressive as those have been. (For me, the Mahler set certainly comes close.) The sheer volume and quality of the material from the Vanguard vault -- and the fact that it goes far beyond the standard \"Best of Beethoven\" fare -- makes for a set that not even serious Beethoven collectors will want to pass up -- unless they already have all these recordings. Even they may want to pick this up, however, just to save themselves the trouble of ripping it all to their portable devices.\n\nHappy birthday Beethoven! And to us all.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Wolf Alice is an up-and-coming indie music band from London, formed in 2010 by singer-guitarist Ellie Rowsell and guitarist Joff Oddie. They released their debut single \"Fluffy\" in early 2013, and have released a steady stream of singles and EPs since then. The anticipation for the debut album increased with every step along the way. Now finally comes the full-length debut album. If you are not familiar with Wolf Alice's sound, think other female-fronted indie bands like Metric or the Duke Spirit.\n\nThe opening lines of the opening track on \"My Love Is Cool\" (13 tracks; 51 min.) are \"Keep your beady eyes on me\/To make sure I don't turn to dust\" (from \"Turn To Dust), as if Rowsell is commanding immediate attention. Strangely the tone on the opening track is surprisingly subdued, but that changes right away with the next track, an early song called \"Bros\" (in a re-recorded version). The very best song on the album follows shortly, \"Moaning Lisa Smile\" (from their 2014 \"Creature Songs\" EP), an irresistible guitar-heavy stomper. \"You're A Germ\" (the album's 2nd UK single) reminds me of the band Garbage. And the highlights keep on coming! \"Lisbon\" is another nice up-tempo tune. \"Giant Peach \"(1st UK single) is what I would call a \"typical\" or \"representative Wolf Alice song, just great. \"Swallowtail\" is the only song on the album not fronted by Ellie Rowsell (drummer Joel Amey does the honors). \"Fluffy\" (also in a re-recorded version) is next to last. Please note that after the closing track \"The Wonderwhy\" ends, a short hidden track emerges after a minute or so of silence.\n\nBottom line: this is one fantastic debut album! Sure to make my \"best albums of the year\" list in December. I haven't had a chance to see these guys in concert, and can only hope thye will come close to Cincinnati at some point (they have 10 US dated on their schedule but nothing anywhere close to Cincy, sadly).

{"text":"I'm going to start this right off by saying that I now fully believe Swans mastermind Michael Gira's statement that 'The Seer' took 30 years to make and is \"the culmination of every previous Swans album and any other music I've made.\" At first I thought he was being hyperbolic, but after two straight listens and four hours gone by, I'm pretty much exhausted and drained--physically and emotionally--like I'd just run the gamut of every conceivable emotion, including two or three that I never knew existed. Try \"scared\" yet \"blissful.\" Or \"sad\" yet \"euphoric,\" which seems like it makes no sense, but I can almost guarantee that if you listen with an open mind (for those of you who may be new to Swans) and just let the music take over, it will.\n\nAnd, like Gira, I'm not exaggerating. While I'm definitely a fan of a lot of his past work, I'm not a hardcore Swans fan who's predisposed to think everything he puts out is genius. In truth, I have to be in just the right mood for his music, and even then there's only so much I can take before I feel like lying down in the middle of a busy expressway, due to suddenly feeling yet another unique-to-Swans-emotion that goes a little something like this: \"I'm an insignificant speck in this vast universe, so what's the point,\" mixed with \"horrified\" and something a little like vertigo. Of course, even creating music that induces nihilism and dizziness takes tremendous talent, but still, it can wear on you.\n\n'The Seer,' though, is much more sprawling in its scope than even 1996's epic 'Soundtracks for the Blind,' both in its emotional content and its virtual myriad of musical styles. Sure, you'll find \"depressing\" here. Quite a bit, in fact. But then there are moments of nearly overwhelming beauty to counteract it, making the highs that much higher. While this album is instantly recognizable as being the product of Swans, it definitely breaks new musical ground while still nodding to the band's--and at times music in general's--past.\n\nI'm not going to break the album down track by track, as it needs to be experienced fully in order to get the maximum effect. Suffice to say, you'll hear repetitious, skull-piercing riffs and drones that slowly morph into something else over time; ambient--yet tension-filled--Brian Eno-esque innerspace soundscapes; jazzy, almost Krautrockian post-rock; intense tribal rhythms; even a country-ish ballad in the Karen-O sung \"Song for a Warrior.\" Not to mention what may be the most beautiful, awe-inspiring song of Swans' career: the 19-minute \"A Piece of the Sky,\" featuring former member Jarboe's ethereal vocals.\n\nGira's voice is in full-effect throughout the album: from near-angelic, to ominous, to straight-up primal, and everything in-between, with lyrics that can still be devastating, especially if one's in the right frame of mind. Throw in some cameos by Ben Frost, the husband and wife duo of Alan Sparhawk & Mimi Parker from Low, and the aforementioned Karen-O, and what you have is possibly the most ambitious, demanding, most exciting album of the year, in any genre.\n\nIt's amazing to me that, at this late stage in his 30 year career, Gira's still getting better; musically, vocally, and lyrically. It's a rare thing indeed for an artist to still be peaking at 58 years-old. But 'The Seer' is, without a doubt, a work of art, and the best album of his career, imo. Maybe, in another couple years, this will be considered just his second-best, though it's hard to imagine anything topping this. But at this rate, it wouldn't surprise me if he keeps getting better for yet another 30 years. All I know is, we're all lucky to have him.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"One reviewer noted that Dido does not drastically change or experiment much with her sound, but that each of her albums is a measured change in subtle increments. She tinkers and toys with her sound like renovating a room in a house. Each of her albums is slightly different from one another. So, \"Girl Who Got Away\" is not much of a musical, or even lyrical, departure for Dido, but what she does do within her house of music, she does well. While 2008's \"Safe Trip Home\" was a study in somberness with sparse musical arrangements driven by the loss of her father, \"Girl Who Got Away\" is more uptempo, electronic, and perhaps lyrically back to 2008's \"Life For Rent\".\n\nThe 11 tracks go down easily, but like all of her albums, \"Girl Who Got Away\" just misses being a classic album. \"No Freedom\", \"Girl Who Got Away\", \"Let Us Move On\", \"Blackbird\", \"End Of Night\" and \"Sitting On The Roof Of The World\" pack a solid first side punch. Things get a little uneven (as they often do for all Dido albums) toward the back half. I could argue that \"Love To Blame\", \"Go Dreaming\" and \"Loveless Hearts\" are the three weakest tracks here--and they are not poor songs, just potential album filler. \"Happy New Year\" and a possible 9\/11 nod, \"Day Before We Went To War\" are the most interesting tracks on the back half.\n\nThere are six bonus tracks on the deluxe version. The alternate version of \"Let Us Move On\" is not as good, in my opinion, as the original album version. \"All I See\" is decent. The best bonus tracks are \"Just Say Yes\" and \"Let's Runaway\". The Armin Van Buuren remix of the \"Sex & The City 2\" soundtrack song \"Everything To Lose\" is passable, and finally, \"Lost\" is just okay.\n\nAs I listened to \"Girl Who Got Away\" multiple times this week, I felt it was a good, solid, sturdy album from Dido. I like it as much as \"Life For Rent\". Each album from Dido is pretty good, and I like her as an artist--she is still unique in her own way when held up against such contemporaries as Enya, Sarah McLachlan, Loreena McKennitt, Paula Cole, Annie Lennox, Goldfrapp, Enigma, Mike Oldfield, Sarah Brightman, Jane Siberry, Joni Mitchell, Fiona Apple, Tori Amos, Regina Spektor, Feist, Alanis Morissette, Jewel, Imogen Heap, etc. Dido has her own vocal style with her own musical style courtesy of contributions by her brother, Rollo (of Faithless).\n\nSo, four stars for \"Girl Who Got Away\". I suspect it will end up on my end of year best list. Here's how it compares to Dido's other albums:\n\n1999 No Angel: Three Stars\n2003 Life For Rent: Four Stars\n2008 Safe Trip Home: Three and a Half Stars\n2013 Girl Who Got Away: Four Stars","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"This sampler from the Mishara label follows the classic Amazonian free sampler formula of \"good music for a great price.\"  Essentially you have four artists represented, Peter Bradley Adams and his former bandmate from eastmountainsouth, Kat Maslich Bode; plus Colin Devlin of the fine band The Devlins, and Barnaby Bright, a folk duo from NYC.  I've always liked Peter's music, as represented by his latest excellent album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Between-Us\/dp\/B005236YDM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Between Us<\/a>.  The two PBA songs here are quite good.  As for Kat, she has released very little recorded music since the breakup of eastmountain ('04), and it's great to hear her singing again.  That leaves Colin Devlin, whose Devlins song \"Waiting\" is a favorite of mine (as heard on TV's \"Six Feet Under\"), and Barnaby Bright.  Colin's songs on this sampler are both great.  Barnaby Bright was the only name on this album I had not previously heard of, but it turns out they've also had songs on TV shows (ex., on \"E.R.\").  I mistakenly thought Barnaby was a guy, although hearing the lovely voice of Rebecca Bright singing made me realize it's just the group name.  (Rebecca is joined by her husband Nathan in the band.)  Of the two BB songs here, \"the Stone\" is really nice, with an especially sweet vocal from Rebecca, but I'm not as enamored with \"Reverend's Son,\" which has more of an ordinary Appalachian folk feel.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"I'm one of the rare Sevendust fans who doesn't buy the Cubs\/White Sox-like dichotomy that you can only like Sonny Mayo's or Clint Lowery's guitarwork. This is Sonny's final album with Sevendust, and it is for the most part excellent.\n\nThat said, too much attention goes to the Sonny\/Clint thing. John Connolly is an excellent guitarist by any standard, and Vinnie Hornsby on bass is utterly insane in the best bassist kind of way.  While Morgan Rose's powerful drumming and backing vocals and Lajon Witherspoon's sometimes-raging sometimes-gentle vocals often take center stage, John and Vinnie together form the solid sinews of each song, whether with Sonny, Clint or any of their guest instrumentalists. That kind of flexibility for a rhythm duo should not be passed up.\n\nTo the album itself:\n\"Chapter VII\" is the most brooding and mood-changing album since \"Animosity\". It reflects the band's maturity and that they are consummate artists - something that may not be appreciated by fans who stopped listening after the viciously good \"Home\" or who didn't tune in until the mainstream-friendly but deliciously experimental \"Seasons\".\n\nWhere \"Alpha\" was pure aggression (listening to the title song is like kickboxing on four shots of espresso), \"Chapter VII\" remains agitated but is consciously brooding and sometimes defiant.\n\n\"Inside\" is an awesome opening track (though I would have put \"Enough\" later in the album, since it shares the same energy and made me wonder whether they were two movements on the same theme). I can picture the lights slowly coming up as Morgan's drumming agitates further to the driving guitar crescendos, followed by Lajon's terse argument and his more melodic self-rebuttal as John, Vinnie and Sonny blend into a tempo change that at once foretells and anticipates the complex harmony at the core of the song.\n\n\"Hope\" is, ironically, the darkest song on the album, though Mark Tremonti's guitar work adds a stunning narrative that makes me wonder if the band will tap him if Lowery takes on another project. There's something in the pacing of \"Scapegoat\" that doesn't seem to mesh as well with other tracks; \"Prodigal Son\" is the opposite - strongly driven by Lajon's own vocal rhythm. \"Lifeless\" and \"Walk Away\" are both masterful and let each member of the band shine - blends of minor and power chords, alternatingly intense and soulful drumming, shifting bass lines that both lead and drive the melody, and Lajon's incredibly expressive range.\n\nIn short, \"Chapter VII\" is an excellent album that, while not as singles-friendly as \"Animosity\" or \"Next\", holds together in a cohesion that good albums should and rare albums do.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"I come to Privateering somewhat of a blank slate when it comes to Mark Knopfler, as my only real reference for his prior work is \"Money For Nothing\" over 25 years ago.  However, my curiosity was raised when I read about it on the product page a few weeks ago.  I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad that I did.\n\nPrivateering seems like a rather ambitious project with 20 original songs spanning folk, rockabilly, and blues.  While I liked the majority of what I heard, I want to get my only criticism out of the way first.  Some of the blues songs have rather repetitive lyrics.  I know this is common for the genre, but Knopfler avoids it on the blues shuffles \"I Used To Could\" and \"Today Is Okay\".  It is on tracks like \"Miss You Blues\", \"Go, Love\", \"Got To Have Something\", and \"Bluebird\" that it was on display and bothered me.\n\nThe folk songs fared much better in my book.  Some of them had elements that reminded me of the \"Concerning Hobbits\" opening of the Fellowship of the Ring.  How can hear a tin whistle and not think of Bilbo?  I think Knopfler wanted that whimsical mood on \"Haul Away\" where listeners hear \"The morning brings, Lord, a fresh young breeze to fill out sails, to end the doldrums\".  The other song where I found this was \"Kingdom Of Gold\", and the tin whistle takes listeners away to another place and time where the story of the song takes place.\n\nI also liked the rockabilly songs including \"Corned Beef City\" which seems like an ode to day laborers.  In addition, I liked how Knopfler used interesting structure in places such as \"Blood And Water\" which follows a chorus\/verse\/chorus\/verse\/chorus pattern.  This is inverted compared to what the radio-hit formula suggests.  The closing song \"After The Beanstalk\" is a honky tonk number that will appeal to O' Brother, Where Art Thou? fans.\n\nOverall, Privateering is a collection of songs that spans a number of styles and has a lot to like.  You don't need to be a long time die-hard Mark Knopfler fan to find something here to enjoy.  Give it a try.  I think you'll like what you find.\n\nDownload this:  Kingdom Of Gold","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"The first time I heard the name Bruno Mars when at a summer pride festival when a local band in my area called The Blast Addicts did a version of his song \"The Lazy Song\". I'd seen this album around but paid it little attention. Over time I've had more exposure to his young hipster attitude and his inspired state show,I began to realize this might just be a talent worth exploring. It's been a very long time since I heard an artist whose songs were inspiring interpretation so early in the game. While references to him as \"the new Michael Jackson\" were a complete turn off at first,considering how few artists will ever likely live up to a vibrant talent on the level of MJ again, But what was this man going to have to say on his own terms?\n\n  The first two songs on this album \"Grenade\" and \"Just The Way You Are\" do in fact possess that epic production sound so common today,however the pop-soul song craft of the compositions themselves are really quite amazing. My personal favorite track here is the slinky funk\/reggae of \"Our First Time\",with it's beautifully jazzy chord changes.\"Runaway Baby\" is a high octane,guitar based funk rocker where \"The Lazy Song\" pulls pop,soul,funk and light hip-hop rhtyhms together for a song celebrating the sometimes slacker spirit of youth. The same impulse carries on into the sparse new wave style \"Marry You\",though this time seeking a commitment through naivety.  \"Talking To The Moon\" is a moody,reflective piano based ballad.\n\n  Damian Marley shows up for the heavy reverbed reggae of \"Liquor Store Blues\",an ode to drowning sorrows where \"Count On Me\" is a sweet little acoustic based song with a strong Caribbean flavor. The ending finds Mars as a soul man supreme on the heavily Stax inspired \"The Other Side\" recorded,of course with Cee Lo Green. Brimming with youthful charm and innocence this singer\/songwriter\/musician also shows great potential for a significant,long term creative expansion as he grows artistically. He puts a great deal of thought into his writing and his musical ideas. And while it's clear he operates on many levels firmly within the contemporary musical idiom,his basic musical flavors come out of 60's and 70's sunshine pop melodies-through the filters of the soul,funk and reggae music he clearly loves. Probably the idea pop album for this particular time period.","classification":5,"fold":4}

(I'm weird like that)\n\nSeriously all three of these women can really sing. Of course that's no surprise as they've all been around for a while and made names for themselves and being good singers. But together they really sound great!\n\nThe tracks all focus heavily on the vocals, which is smart for a collaboration like this. There is a band in the background but it's really subtle most of the time. Even when you can hear the band more prominently the vocals are still more strongly highlighted and not drowned out.\n\nThe harmony that the three of them produce is amazing.\n\nTrack 7 - Behind The Armory, particularly stood out to me as just being wonderful music. It's my favorite track on the album. But it's by no means the only good one.\n\nTrack 11 - I Want To Be Here, is probably the best example of the trio's harmony together.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Hard to believe today it is 5 years since Michael Jackson tragically lost his own life the way he did. I definitely do not think Michael Jackson forgot all the years he was judged as a pedophile and wacko jacko. Still he still had some great songs towards the end of his career and his life. You Rock My World, one of his last hit songs originally from the lackluster Invincible album is still one of those few standouts from that album that is playing well. It showed a more R&B rhythm to the appeal that Michael Jackson wanted to get into a generation that was getting into Destiny's Child, TLC and when a lot of R&B really was going more into a dance and hip hop rhythm. It really was a good song, but one of Michael Jackson's last to really hit the nail on the head. If you would prefer Michael's music from the afterlife, as it was released from the Xscape record, you should absolutely go back to what made Michael Jackson a legend in the first place, and get Invincible with You Rock My World.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"I just reviewed this album, but I also wanted to add my thoughts on the deluxe version, which I own.  So first I'll post my review of the album itself, and then I'll tag on my thoughts on the bonus songs included in this version.\n\nFirst, my review of `Waking Up':\n\n\"I really like OneRepublic.  I remember when I first heard `Apologize' and I was instantly hooked.  I love their style and their sound and Ryan Tedder's voice is magic to my ears.  He has the perfect falsetto, yet he never comes off as anything less than masculine in his delivery.  Lyrically, they have a nice repertoire, and just when I think that they can't one-up themselves I hear the next track and I'm engaged all over again.\n\nAll of this said, they have yet to produce an album as universally complete as I know they are capable of.\n\nIn parts `Waking Up' is a great album.  Sadly, OneRepublic winds up tied down by the one thing that makes them so unique; their sound.  When you hear any of the songs on this album it is instantly obvious that it is a One Republic song.  Even before Ryan starts serenading us, we know that his voice is about to be broadcast.  OneRepublic has a signature sound that they drench each and every track on this album with to the point where their songs start to run into one another.\n\nIt's a shame, I know.\n\nThe eleven tracks on this album range from great to mediocre, with only really one song standing out as unappealing to me, but then again only three stand out as truly amazing to me.\n\nThe album opens with a gigantic bang, the first three songs basically setting the bar SO high that the only way to go from there was down.  `Made For You' is a fantastic opening track, perfectly fusing the pop beats with the soft piano and that chorus is just hauntingly hushed yet loud with emotional merit.  `All the Right Moves' keeps the energy high with a chorus so energetically engrossing you can't help but become a part of the song.  Still, `Secrets' is even better.  The musical opening is stunning and instantly grabs the listener.  The lyrical content is pure and poignant.  When the songs snaps into attention less than 40 seconds in with that stunning chorus you know that you have found this bands opus.\n\nAnd then the album starts to spiral away from itself.\n\n`Everybody Loves Me' is rich with satirical content, but it just doesn't manage to be anything more than a Beck soundalike.  `Good Life' is `happy-inducing' but it is also a tad lazy.  It just sounds so familiar for them, with no real newness to it.  That said, I really like the song.  In fact, I really like the entire album, it just doesn't wow me like I expected after that one-two-THREE punch right off the bat.  `Marchin On' has grown on me, if not for the fact that it shows true ambition.  It can feel a tad long, but no where near as long as the title track, `Waking Up', comes off as.  In fact, that song is the one that I just DO NOT LIKE.  It is just really bland and it carries on for far too long.  `Missing Persons 1 & 2' is nice and subtle, yet it doesn't leave a major impact.  It is pretty to listen to, but Ryan's voice does seem to strain in parts.  I do like the haunting quality to the song, but it just doesn't live up to potential.  The shift in song structure is also odd.  Why didn't they separate this into two tracks?  `All This Time' sounds like something they've already done, with no real spark or anything to remember.  In fact, it actually sounds a tad dated.  `Fear' is simply forgettable.  It almost feels like an afterthought.\n\nThe closing song `Lullaby' would have been less disappointing had the rest of the album been more impressive.  It isn't a bad song at all, and it would generally be a great way to end an album (soft, sweet, serene) but instead it just becomes another seemingly dull song.\n\nIn the end, I still give this album a B and recommend it if you are a fan of the group.  Ryan Tedder is going to stick around (highly in demand as a song writer and producer as well) so I don't expect this band to go away anytime soon, which is a good thing.  I want them to release an album that lives up to what I know they can create.  They have the goods and they have a unique and signature sound that I really wish they would use to the full instead of allowing it to defeat them by rendering them seemingly `one-note'.\"\n\nNow, for my thoughts on the bonus disc:\n\nLike my review title suggests, this deluxe version really doesn't add anything new to the picture.  Aside from the beautifully delicate `It's a Shame', this is just a mix of mediocre fare.  If you purchased the Exclusive provided by this site then you will also have their cover of Duffy's `Mercy'.  I actually love what they did with it.  The original is better (obviously) but their cover shows some versatility on their part and I want to see more of that.  `Passenger' is just horribly crafted.  It is not only boring but it is musically annoying (the guitar riff is ear-splitting).  `Trap Door' and `Sucker Punch' are not bad, but they really lack any true spark.  They definitely feel like B-Side tracks that were left off the album for a reason, not bonus tracks we should be grateful were released for us.  `Sucker Punch' has a Harvey Danger feel to it, which I kind of like, but it isn't developed enough.\n\nHere is my ranking for those interested:\n\n1) Secrets\n2) Made for You\n3) All the Right Moves\n4) Mercy\n5) Good Life\n6) It's a Shame\n7) Marchin On\n8) Everybody Loves Me\n9) Lullaby\n10) Missing Persons 1 & 2\n11) Sucker Punch\n12) All This Time\n13) Trap Door\n14) Fear\n15) Waking Up\n16) Passenger","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"This caught me off guard a little because this album version of this song is not the version that we hear in the music video. There is no rapping in this version and it's just all Taylor. At first I thought it was Selena Gomez during the verses because it's \"sung\" at a much lower register than what Taylor sings on her other songs.\n\nI feel like this is a dark song for Taylor and overall it's a true departure from her other work. I've seen her perform this live before and she seems to struggle with it at times since it really is a lower register song which makes me wonder why she chose to have the song sung is this key. It's a relatable song if you're ever had someone burn you or had a failed relationship. In all honesty I find it to be a song that helps me get over some things including a bad breakup.","classification":4,"fold":4}
{"text":"While the first compilation contained 26 tracks lasting 65 minutes, this one contains 28 generally longer tracks lasting 95 minutes.

I am the walrus is a very silly song, but it has a certain appeal.\nThis is a superb collection containing almost (but not quite) all the essential Beatles tracks from the period covered.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"The album is amazing. Obviously. It's one of the most widely acclaimed albums of all time for a reason. You know it. You love it. I'll save us time and skip the review of the music.\n\nSo about the remastering and the volume thing...\n\nThe vocals are brought up a bit and the band is brought down a tad. This keeps the vocals from being totally overpowered by the music. The end result is that you can hear Kurt Cobain's lyrics MUCH more clearly than you could on the original release. Now that it's no longer the early 90's and I'm no longer a teenager, I like this. Nirvana's lyrics were always amazing, but they often got overshadowed by the music, which was also amazing.  I like that I can listen to this now and really hear Cobain's awesome poetry crisply and clearly.\n\nHowever, that makes this sound different. Part of the appeal to Nirvana back in the day was how they just put the music right in your face and made it push right through you. You almost had to work to hear the words, and that wasn't a bad thing. It immersed you in the music and made it a part of you in your attempt to really 'get it'.\n\nSince I'm already familiar with the music and have been for 25 years now, I feel like the music is already a part of me and I'm glad to hear the vocals more clearly. Especially since I'm entering the \"Hey you kids! Turn down that darn loud music!\" stage of my life. But for listeners new to Nirvana, I'd suggest starting with the originally version of this album first.","classification":5,"fold":4}

Musically though, they have had very few setback with music, especially after the massive success of American Idiot. But they followed it up well with 21st Century Breakdown. Still, with plans for a trio of albums coming around, they do have a lot to prove to their fans with great music. But, their first single isn't actually one of their better songs with Oh Love from the upcoming Uno, the first in the trio of records that is set to be released. It really isn't as driven as was the case with 21 Guns or Boulevard Of Broken Dreams showed. Hopefully, when there will be more music coming around from Green Day, there will be a lot more excitement from Billie Joe and company soon. Something more than just love.\n\nSong: C 1\/2+","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"Seemingly out of nowhere, but brewing just underneath the surface of Nashvilles obsession with the tailgates, trucks, dirt roads, hot chicks, and faux redneck rap that is Bro Country (and its various offshoots), there has been a slow but sure resurfacing of country music rooted in both traditional and progressive values.  Guys like Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell, and Sturgill Simpson have been more or less leading this charge, but don't think the womenfolk are getting left behind.  If anything, as demonstrated over the past decade and a half, and counting Tift Merritt and Caitlin Rose among them, women are being seen as essential to this revitalization of the genre.  Enter Illinois native Margo Price with her album MIDWEST FARMERS DAUGHTER, one of the great albums of any genre by anybody in the year 2016.\n\nMuch like Canadian gal Lindi Ortega had done in 2015 with FADED GLORYVILLE, Margo has done with this album, by mixing in a variety of styles, rooted in classic 1960s\/1970s country, of the Bakersfield honky-tonk variety, but including a fair amount of Memphis\/Muscle Shoals R&B and old-school country-rock of the Linda Ronstadt\/Emmylou Harris variety as well.  Margo has had a fairly rough life up to this point (even seeing the wrong side of a jail cell), one that screams the story of a great C&W song, but being the survivor she is, of both jail and heartbreaks galore, she brings that to vivid life.  She took it upon herself to record MIDWEST FARMERS DAUGHTER in the halls of Sun Studios in Memphis, the place where Elvis made his groundbreaking recordings that would help set the tone for American popular music in the second half of the 20th century, and this more than explains the musical mixings she engages in.  Songs like About To Find Out and Since You Put Me Down are classic-sounding honky-tonk material in a modern context.  Meanwhile, Weekender is a perfectly dissolute song about her time in jail, while Hurtin (On The Bottle), a co-write of Margos with the aforementioned Caitlin Rose, is another honky-tonk C&W masterpiece.  Other songs like Four Years Of Chances have a Southern R&B feel to them.\n\nIn any case, this isn't the sort of album thats likely to get too much airplay, on corporate country radio at least.  While there are no F-bombs dropped, there is a little bit of language in some of the songs lyrics that would give MIDWEST FARMERS DAUGHTER the equivalent of the MPAAs PG rating.  And the combination of Telecaster twang and pedal steel guitar, a hallmark of classic 1960s Bakersfield honky-tonk and 1970s L.A. country-rock, must by now sound alien to people blinded by the processed junk of Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan, and Florida-Georgia Line (to name just three Bromeister acts).  Still, all in all, thanks to Margos authenticity and a voice that is naturalistic, MIDWEST FARMERS DAUGHTER has taken it all the way down the field for the touchdown.  It is essential listening, whether you're a fan of traditional country, a fan of progressive country, or, indeed, both.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"One previous Amazon reviewer previously says of the \"Blue album\" that this is \"the Old Testament for me\". This is fully endorsed since the both the Blue and Red Albums were the starting point for many of the love affair with the Fabs particularly prior to the age of downloading and at a time when the \"White Album\" required a mortgage to purchase. The first time I bought this was on pre recorded cassette in the late seventies. It snapped at least three times but I carefully prized open the cassette case, gingerly stuck the tape back together with sellotape and constantly \"put it back into the ring\" like a beat up old prize fighter (I still have it). Its sound quality was awful but it was the Beatles music post 1967 for godsake, probably the greatest pop music ever recorded and there was no way that you could live without it.\n\nExamining today this remaster coming hot on the heels of 2009's recent remastering in the brilliant Box set, the Blue Album still ranks as one of the great music compilations. With 28 tracks lasting 95 minutes it is much longer than the Red album and draws most heavily on tracks from the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" with seven songs present. St Pepper, the White Album, Let it Be and Abbey Road all get four each and there are some surprising omissions like \"She's leaving home\" the \"Golden slumbers trio\", \"Blackbird\" and \"Yer Blues\". The rest are singles and in the case of George Harrison's superb \"Old Brown Shoe\" initially a B Side to the \"Ballad of John and Yoko\".\n\nThere is not suggestion however that it should be changed or tampered with since somehow the sequencing on this album is perfect starting with \"Strawberry fields\" and ending with the \"Long and Winding Road\". In between you get Lennon's behemoth \"A Day in the Life\" interspersed with McCartney's \"Woke up, got out of bed\" bridge still standing as the greatest Beatles song. Listening again you remain blown away by the relentless procession of one classic song after another. Some other personal highlights are the pure pop of McCartney's \"Hello Goodbye\", Harrison's epic ballad \"Something\" (check out James Browns great cover), Lennon's precursor to heavy metal \"Come together\" while dear old Ringo gets his token song in the amusing \"Octopus Garden\". Side One probably has the more famous songs but Side Two are strangely the songs I listen to most. Some minor gripes include the fact that \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" remains with \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" one of the most irritating Beatles songs ever, while Joe Cocker's cover of \"With a little help from my friends\" is probably better than the original.\n\nOverall even if you don't own a CD player or any Music equipment you should still own this album! Someone once said that everyone who listened to the Velvets seminal first album formed a band. It's probably true, but equally everyone who listened to the Red and the Blue albums discovered the benchmark that any new band with pretensions to greatness must aspire to. No one has reached that benchmark yet and perhaps they never will.","classification":5,"fold":4}

As for Leona Lewis, I am very impressed with the depth of not just her voice, but the songs that she has shown with style and heart. They really don't feel like they are overexposed. Her second single, Better In Time, from her debut album Spirit, really isn't a bad song.

You can absolutely feel the love and respect from the bands for each other and the music, and boy oh boy the peaks are breath-taking. I tend to crack up in laughter at moments throughout this recording, the intensity is so overwhelming. These are some of the best jazz players the genre has produced, veterans of four decades of swing at this point in 1961, and this one-off meeting never disappoints.\n\n  Having each band in one channel makes this surreal on good headphones. Nice production too, solid remaster with the brass register rarely shrill.\n\nAlong with Cannonball Adderley's Know What I Mean?, this is one of the sweetest semi-unknown jazz recordings. If you know someone who says jazz doesn't rock, just throw on cut one, crank it loud and proud, and step back with a smile.\n\n  Are there any musicians of this calibre still alive?

When the law breaks in, how you gonna go?  Shot down on the pavement or waiting on death row?\"  It's such a powerful political song of struggle.  \"Outsider\" sounds like a reggae-soul hybrid with its horn charts and its retro-sounding chorus as Cliff spells out the title.  \"Reggae Music\" & \"Rebel Rebel\" are also delightful; and \"Blessed Love\" is sweetly profound.  \"Rebirth\" is a dynamic set not to be missed.

Rather than go for big showy songs and belting, she goes for a more intimate sound similar to Norah Jones', Jazzy Folk with a touch of Country. A fan on classic black and white movies, she tries to make her music a sonic equivalent.\n\nShe co-wrote 11 of the dozen tracks, and her nuanced nasal delivery perfectly suits the songs. Highlights include opening cut the gorgeous \"Rainy Day Woman\" (drenched in theatrical strings and sprinkled with horns), the slinky Bossa Nova \"You Said Enough\", the tender acoustic Bluesy \"Oh My Love\" (which finds her singing in a smoky lower register - absolutely brilliant), \"Crying\" (with lovely harmonies), the elegiac \"Till We Start To Kiss\", the playful cabaret Pop \"The Best\" (with Jazzy scatting), the quivery Country-tinged \"Dark Cloud\" (\"They settled it up in Heaven, now I'm just waiting on you\"), and closing cut the Country ballad \"Who's Counting\".\n\nMy favourite though is \"You Can't Break My Heart\" (the one song she didn't have a hand in writing), delicately plucked guitar, magnificent strings, and barely there percussion, and a quivery guitar solo, it wouldn't sound out of place on a spaghetti western - incredibly beautiful!","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Lewis Black's third album, Rules of Enragement, is his first release where his material really became more political. Keeping with tradition, Lewis starts out his show by busting on the city he's performing in. This time around he busts on Minnesota and his bit on their cold weather is hysterical. As usual, he's spot on when it comes to tackling issues like greed in big business and society's obsession with health. In particular, his commentary on milk and water are very funny. However, the end of the album is dominated by his views on Iraq. While his commentary is accurate, it does tend to drag at times. All told, Rules of Enragement is a very good album even if it tends to be too political near the end.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"This song starts with some nice sustained guitar notes and bongo into which is blended a wailing, melancholy sax. At a minute the vocal enters. The vocal is well performed and I like the quality of Jerry Rafferty's voice which is a tenor with a very slight nasal quality that doesn't get irritating. The sax reenters the composition from time to time and is one of the really great aspects. There is also an orchestra that comes in along with continued persecution. Overall it is a moody yet invigorating performance.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"This isn't Elton's worst album but it lacks the musical ambition, depth and sharp lyrics that his best work with Bernie Taupin had during his peak years (from \"Elton John\" through to \"Captain Fantastic\"). \"A Single Man\" still has moments that an Elton John fan will appreciate even if the album is a bit inconsistent. Prolific as ever Elton produced 16 tracks 11 of which ended up on this album. The best tracks \"Part Time Love\", the moving instrumental \"Song for Guy\" and \"Georgia\" (which sounds like a outtake from \"Honky Chateau\" or \"Tumbleweed Connection\")were catchy with solid melodies and lyrics that if they were somewhat uninspired at times also lacked the excess that dominated Bernie's lyrics towards the end of their collaborations in the late 70's and even early 80's.)\n\n Elton severed his relationship with Taupin because of the distance between them (Taupin lived in the US, Elton the UK and while it was a physical distance it could also be seen as a metaphorical one for their relationship as well) after the failure of the single \"Ego\"\/\"Flintstone Boy\" in the charts. That failure more had to do with the lack of merit of the songs themselves. While they aren't bad they are second tier Elton John songs and even Bernie's lyrics fall short.\n\nThe generic production of John and long time engineer Clive Franks along with the generic arrangements\/orchestral backing make \"A Single Man\" less than a classic but still worthy of a listen for long time fans. In many respects EJ should have been given a fresh start as he was working with a brand new collaborator (lyricst Gary Osborne)who hadn't had the chance to develop the depth that Taupin's lyrics had at their best. Osborne's lyrics aren't horrible--they're just generic and uninspired for many of the tracks and reflect his work as a jingle writer (Osborne also was a member of the rock band Vigrass & Osborne and produced two fine albums during the early 70's before turning to jingle writing neither one of which is currently inprint).\n\nElton would further stumble with the dreadful \"Victim of Love\" (which he did not write and, in fact, was contractually obligatated to provide only lead vocals for)one of the worst albums recorded by a major rock act (along with John Lennon's \"Two Virgins\", \"Life with the Lions\" & \"Sometime in New York City\" and Mick Jagger's first two solo albums). \"A Single Man\" isn't a dreadful or horrible album and has some nice tracks that make pleasant listening. EJ was trying to reestablish himself after his star began falling in the late 70's. This was the first step and we'd see a nice return to form on some of the tracks for \"21 at 33\", \"Jump Up\",\"The Fox\" (many of the tracks for this album were leftovers from \"21 at 33\") before a full return to form with \"Too Low for Zero\" in 1983. 2 1\/2 stars.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"It's truly hard to believe that The Beatles crammed this much creative activity into a three year period. One could argue that song selection on \"1967-1970\" should have started with the \"Revolver\" album, which was a glimpse into the forthcoming \"Sgt. Pepper.\" But what a glorious period it still was without those songs. Beginning with the pocket symphony (to borrow Brian Wilson's phrase) of \"Strawberry Fields Forever,\" it just seems like the exploratory range of Lennon\/McCartney's songwriting was boundless. They grabbed critics by their lapels and shook them till their stuffiness came loose, and screamed at them till the artistry of popular music was recognized. The entire first disc still sounds amazing after more than 3 decades.\nOn disc two was when The Beatles began to splinter and it starts showing. Fortunately the individual efforts were often just as brilliant as the band's. George Harrison in particular, with both his \"Something\" and \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" here. They also wanted to show that they could still rock as hard as any of their contemporaries (\"Back In The USSR\"). And even as they were collapsing, they still bowed out with two of the most amazing songs ever written, \"Let It Be\" and \"The Long and Winding Road.\" As far as a primer for a young listener or a solid but quick fix for the older Beatles fan, 1967-1970 opens the window for timeless music.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"please understand, that as what I wrote in an earlier review, I believe that there is more than enough room in this world for women who choose to be childfree and those who choose to become and stay mothers  (regardless of their age).  For some reason, I have heard billie jean by Michael Jackson on the radio enough times for the song to grow on me. Im taking it that billie jean by Michael Jackson symbolizes the journey of a man coming to terms with being the father of a woman who became pregnant at an extremely young age (Im guessing a teenager) due to the lyrics she is just a girl. He does not want to believe that he is the father, but he sees that he probably is due to singing about looking at the babys eyes that remind him of his own eyes. From my humble opinion, Billie jean by Michael Jackson still does touch on a relevant issue today because the common societal message that is still being sent is that every woman who is someone becomes a mother, and I do believe that many teenage females subconsciously take in this message and internalize it. I just happen to have made my own decision on what I was going to do after my teenage years when I was tasked with helping my adoptive mother look after the younger children in her care.  I have an open mind when it comes to teenage mothers because I myself was born to a woman who had just turned 16 8 days before my entrance into this world. However, that is all that Im going to say for now for a compelling song that touches on a topic that is not going to go away anytime soon.","classification":5,"fold":4}

But nevertheless, he wanted his work in his songs to be his way, and not the way of what the record labels wanted him to be. That honestly showed when he left Warner Brothers in the late 90's, after accusing them of slavery in his work. But what Prince has came out with after his departure from Warner Brothers, hasn't honestly been completely up to the strength of what he had before. Breakfast Can Wait, the lead single from his album Art Official Age isn't actually one of his better songs. In fact, compared to songs like Black Sweat and Musicology which he did nearly a decade ago, sound much better than, than what he has put out now.

To be fair, I wouldn't have given this more than one listen if it weren't Steve Harris, but since it is him, and I did, I would say if you are a Maiden or Harris fan, and go in with realistic expectations, you'll find a decent album with some good hard rock songs on it. It's NOT great, and hopefully if Harris continues to do music outside of Maiden he'll go in different direction next time. It's basically a tribute to his earliest influences.

Multiple Grammy award-winning soul singer Luther Vandross became the smooth, brilliant, individualistic stylist of romantic ballads as a solo act, but before he made it big, he was one of the forces that pushed the soul, disco group Change to the big time before he adroitly decided to go as a solo act. The song Searching\" might be considered the 'theme song of Change from the Vandross days, with an infectious ostinato beat from a rocking electric bass, an insistent guitar riff, slick background voices, staccato horns, jazzy drum accents and solo, and a great R&B tenor sax solo. But Vandross urgent, impeccable voice is the driving force pushing the song along. My Highest Recommendation. Five DISCO Star! (Rhino\/Warner Bros. 1 MP3 track. Time-8:03. There is a Parkside mix of the song Searching included on the album.)","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"There has been a sever lack of soul and traditional R&B from the music industry for the past several years. They have been more severely overexposed by rap and hip hop, which has really lagged at real diversity over the recent years. For female R&B groups, they have also not been showing their soul either with that diversity. SWV had been absent from making music for quite awhile and went away after the 90's ended. They did return in 20111 with I Missed Us which did very well. But their latest single doesn't actually show the same bark strike from the apple tree. Their latest single M.C.E. (Man Crush Everyday) tries to go back to basics for them, as they sample the late Michael Jackson with his classic Lady In My Life from the Thriller record. This is something SWV definitely did much better over twenty years ago, when they sampled Human Nature for the trio's hit Right Here. The song is alright, but not anything to sneeze about. I hope the gals can come up with something more brilliant than this one showed.\n\nSong: C 1\/2-","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"During my MTV days, Steve Winwood's big 80's splash with songs from Back In The High Life didn't go unnoticed by me.  After discovering that album and Chronicles, I had the good fortune of someone loaning me her tape of Arc Of A Diver, which I copied.  My interest in his second solo album was due to the upbeat \"While You See A Chance.\"  Winwood's sweeping organ-like synths open his first Top Ten solo hit-it reached #7 in 1981-along with the accompanying lively piano that gives it a radio-friendly beat, with some downright introspective lyrics on if one is truly free from the past and ready to take another road one blue morning with a gray wind blowing.  I find myself enjoying this song more than \"Higher Love.\"\n\nThe title track reached #48 on the singles chart, a slower midpaced affair.  \"Spanish Dancer\" along the same languid lines, may be an example of what many called \"lazy music\" to describe Winwood's early solo stuff.  This song was included on the Chronicles compilation made to cash in on the success of Back in The High Life.\n\nI wonder why \"Second-Hand Woman\" wasn't a chart-topper, as it's a more lively affair with Winwood's trademark keyboards set to a disco beat.  Some racy imagery is present with the title woman being \"a slot machine to take my dime\" but it is quite the danceable track.  The same holds true for the near eight minute on-the-run opus \"Night Train\" with its funky beats mixed with guitars, particularly a solo around the six minute mark, and the usual keyboards.  A single mix of this could've done well, but alas.\n\nTwo non-singles in particular strike me and both are slow songs.  They are \"Slowdown Sundown.\"  A wistful ballad, calling wine that \"glassful of memories\"  and something to soothe the balm of yesterday's pain.  The tempo goes up during the bridge, which is a toast to whoever can understand this madness of life.  The closing track \"Dust\" is the other song which also deals with memories one wants so bad to go away, in this case meaning time with a woman, yet how to deal with a love that's gone, but a friendship that still remains?  Indeed, \"a feather duster is no substitute for the real thing,\" meaning time, \"the universal healer.\"  That brings to mind the Dr. Who quote \"the sands of time wash us all clean.\"\n\nMellow, but not \"lazy music\" as was described by some, Arc Of A Diver shows that Winwood still had some life in him following Traffic.  Considering the turn-of-the-decade changes going on in the music scene, i.e. punk and new wave, it's fortunate that Arc found an audience.  And Winwood played all the instruments on the album, much like Prince had done his own debut For You.  Despite having only seven songs, Arc benefits from a consistent synth-keyboard style, upbeat dance tunes to reflective ballads.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Anyone ploughing through the four discs of Sufjan Stevens new Christmas album \"Sliver and Gold\" will find that it is the musical equivalent of watching \"It's a Wonderful Life\". It is a multilayered work containing equal measures of whimsy, sentimentality and deep dense beauty. Followers of Stevens have been here before of course. Many of his albums such as \"Seven Swans\" have a very wintery sheen about them and no one does Christmas like Sufjan Stevens. In \"Silver and Gold\" he releases a three hour long, 59 track extravaganza as a tinsel tinged follow-up to 2006's 42-song-long \"Songs for Christmas\" collection. In reality Sufjan is somewhat ambiguous about the joys of the season describing the Christmas Tree as \"nothing more than a symbol of environmental bondage\". He has also recently raged against the avalanche of consumerism that engulfs December 25th. Whether or not he is trying to deconstruct the whole festive season is a moot point since these Scrooge like instincts are tempered in his work by the undoubted magic of the season, its sparkle and goodwill. As he states in the booklet attached to this Xmas marathon \"Christmas is what you make of it, and its songs reflect mystery and magic as expertly as they clatter and clang with the most audacious and rambunctious intonations of irreverence.\" Speaking of which you could download the horrible roboticized version of \"Do You Hear What I Hear?\" which goes on forever like a rancid turkey in the microwave. You could also get a interesting cover of Prince's \"Alphabet Street\" which is very well done although quite what its connection is to Christmas is a matter for a detective with the skills of Sherlock Homes to solve.\n\nThere are of course plenty of traditional Christmas songs here including \"An Age of Adz\" style version of \"Good King Wenceslas\", a joyous MOR version of \"Sleigh Ride\" and a 52 second version of \"We three kings\" which sounds like it is being played at a school carol concert. None of these really match Stevens best ever traditional version of a Christmas standard the brilliant \"Oh come, Oh come Emmanuel\" on \"Songs for Christmas\" which is a pure joy, but collectively they are great fun. And yet this is Sufjan Stevens and hidden amongst this wealth of material are plenty of new tracks not least \"Carol of St. Benjamin The Bearded One\" which takes the traditional \"Carol of Bells\" and mutates it into a achingly beautiful Stevens song which is worth the price of admission to the whole box set (for info this review of of the thirteen dollar download version). Equally tracks like \"Barcarola\", \"Justice delivers it death\" and especially the bubbling \"Christmas in the room\" are up there with his very best. The latter is a beautiful little love song and if there was justice in the world it would kick the wretched Slade and George Michael off the Christmas jukebox with a firm boot up the backside. In a direct message to a partner he speaks tenderly of \"No travel plans, no shopping malls\/ No candy canes or Santa Claus\/For as the day of rest draws near\/It's just the two of us this year\".\n\nThe whole feast of Xmas indulgence ends with the 12 minute \"Christmas Unicorn\" which sees Stevens sing the words of Ian Curtis and make them work wonderfully in this setting. At the this point the listener has travelled a very long journey which has had many peaks of snowy beauty but also had to endure some dark brown slush along the the way. But that is the point for Sufjan Stevens good, bad or indifferent is about 100% more interesting than most other artists today and \"Silver and Gold\" is a delight.","classification":4,"fold":4}

For Billy Joel whom has made music for over 20 years, he definitely has shown to not only make brilliant music, his songs sill today are more timeless, than most of the jokes today on radio. While he chose not to record new music, he still gets the chances to perform whenever his heart has desired. Still, the Piano Man from Long Island, NY is definitely one of those musicians that songs has gotten better with age, and not tried to be what the younger generation wants. One of my favorite staples of Billy's happens to be New York State Of Mind as one of those brilliant and intimate songs that captures and ignites you at the soul from the simplicity of the orchestration, organized by the great Phil Ramone, to the soul of Joel ticking the ivories.

In my opinion Dr. Horrible is nothing shy of being utterly addictive to the point of where they'll have 12-step programs for it in the future. It's a joy to partake in and can be listened to time and time again without it losing any of its magic. Consequently I had no problem plopping down $8.99 for this soundtrack the second I saw it available on Amazon here, (I'm not much an iUniverse person), and I can not recommend buying this yourself highly enough.

{"text":"Chris Cornell has been about everyone's favorite singer back since the Soundgarden days, even though I'm a pretty heavy fan of more brutal metal\/thrash\/some Death Metal\/Progressive etc. I have to admit I always liked a few grunge bands. Soundgarden being the coolest, of course because Chris Cornell was the best of a screamer back in the day. And they also had that big fat good old Sabbath sound. Well now as he gets a little older it's great to see him experiment and expand on his musical talents. He admitted to feeling like Neil Young at times, as he is a big fan. Nothing wrong with that, as Neil is\/was a great song writer.\n\nSo don't expect any rock\/or Soundgarden type sounding music here. This is just good old relaxing, acoustic, folk type music that sounds like many artists that came out of the late 60's and early 70's. Great stuff. If you like Neil, James Taylor, Carly Simon, John Lennon or even Bob Dylan (which was before my time) you'll definitely dig this. So go into it with that frame of mind. Relax outside with a cool glass of tea, or even a beer. And remember the good old days of music. When it had heart and soul. Chris has created a masterpiece with this relaxing gem. Enjoy","classification":5,"fold":4}

That is sadly the case with nothing but gibberish from her voice. Her latest song, Blow, the second single from the wasted Cannibal, is absolutely worse than her last song We R Who We R. I really was absolutely not impressed with the song. It just was a waste of time, and Ke$ha is truthfully a real waste of a good artist.

{"text":"The Bach Guild hasn't ventured into this space very often  while we have created several playlists that cross a number of genres, we usually tie it all together with a larger theme based around an instrument (or group of instruments). However, this Big Box represents a few new directions for The Bach Guild as we go forward.\n\nIn true classical music fashion, in order to reach the widest audience, we do acknowledge that there are several different compelling reasons why people want to listen to classical music. We promise to continue our Big and Big Little Boxes dedicated to the vast reaches of our catalog. In the near future we will be releasing a Purcell box, as well as streaming playlists dedicated to the great 20th century composers who recorded for Vanguard\/Bach Guild.\n\nBut we also know that not everyone is looking for music from our vaults  they want the best moments in classical music, neatly compiled and well-performed and recorded. So to this cause, we have begun to construct more broad-based compilations, and Big Greatest Hits is one of our first.\n\nNot much in this set is available for the first time. However, we do introduce additional recordings from the ProArte catalog, which is also owned by the same entity that owns Vanguard. For the purposes of our boxes that aim for larger audiences, we will include these fine recordings as we expand our release schedule into 2015.\n\nSo this hits the peaks of classical music, with the concept that each work will be nearly instantly recognizable, and ultimately, the playlist makes for a very pleasant listening experience that can be put on and enjoyed for minutes, or hours.","classification":5,"fold":4}

This album is clearly not meant for a mainstream appeal and its noticeable. Which is also something I have to give a lot of respect for The Lumineers for. Most groups will do anything to their sound to keep the fans the gained with their first commercial breakthrough but instead they stay true to themselves. This record is very calm, as in a lot of the songs are very slow and quiet and doesn't have any big \"hooks\" to any of the tracks if that's what you're looking for. Despite that, I did really enjoy this album. For what it is, it does the job. If you're looking for a relaxing album to listen to then I recommend this album for you, but if you're looking for something that is more catchy then you may not be into it.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"As the story goes Martha Reeves went to work at Motown as a secretary sometime around 1962 for the paltry sum of $35.00 per week. As Martha recalls \"As part of my job I had to audition other artists, schedule musicians, maintain studio logs and be 'girl-friday' to all the writers and producers. If I clapped or sang background on sessions that was an additional $5.00 each.\" Like so many other artists who came to work at Motown in the early days, Martha Reeves just wanted to get her foot in the door. You see in her spare time she was the lead singer of a local Detroit group known as the Del-Fi's. Her ultimate goal was to get an audition and get a recording contract for her group. Soon the Del-Fi's were hired to sing background on several of Marvin Gaye's early records. Berry Gordy quickly realized that these girls were something special. The group changed its name to Martha and the Vandellas and within just a few months the group was riding high on the Billboard Hot 100 with their debut single \"Come And Get These Memories\". It was the beginning of a fabulous run for this extremely talented and highly energetic group.\n\nMotown wasted little time in issuing the follow-up single. Released in early August 1963 \"(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave\" would become one of the biggest records of that summer peaking at #4. To me the pulsating sounds of Martha Reeves and the Vandellas were the personification of Motown's moniker \"The Sound of Young America\" and this is one of the finest examples. Five stars all the way baby!","classification":5,"fold":4}

Great renditions of Lowell Fulsom's Reconsider Baby, Howlin Wolf's How Many More Years, and Bill Wither's Aint No Sunshine.  Plus a coupl eof track written by Isaac Hayes and David Porter.  In the thirty plus years I have been listening to this, I have worn out at least four copies.  Freddie really knows how to make that guitar sing. I saw Freddie perform with Eric Clapton at Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City shortly before he died, it was a once in a lifetime musical experience for me. Another time, I walked into a blues bar on Bourbon Street in New Orleans many years ago and there was this old, old man playing \"Big Legged Woman\" on the slide guitar and it was amazing! The Texas Cannonball lives!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Here's rock 'n' roll for you. An Irish band formed in Dublin and fronted by an Irish black man in\nshiny leather pants. The members of the band also spanned the Irish Catholic and Protestant\ncommunities. Quite something for 1969.\n\nThe song \"Jailbreak\", was an international hit, along with \"The Boys Are Back In Town\". These\nsongs are rotated regularly on hard rock and classic radio stations today and for good reason.\n\n\"Jailbreak\", features, like a lot of other of Thin Lizzy's songs, twin lead guitars. Superb guitar\nwork from both guitarists and a signature of the band giving Thin Lizzy a distinctive edge over\nother bands. \"Jailbreak\" was on the album by the same name, and was their sixth release.\n\n\"Jailbreak\" lyrics speak for themselves. Working class sentimentality and total brazenness is\nhow this song will speak to you. This was another element of the the band's personality. There\nis no doubt that when you hear that opening chord and subsequent riff you are hearing some\ncool rockin' and rollin'.  The lyric riff is rather staccato and helps provide an immediate tension\nwithin the song.\n\nThe release comes from the repetitive refrain, \"The boys are back in town\", as it is more fluid\nand harmonic. There is a nice back and forth motion between the lyrics and the refrain each\ntime. The guitar fills and single leads are done perfectly as they accent each set of lyrics and\nhelp transition from the refrain back to the lyric. This is a nicely written song.\n\nListening to this song always makes me want to learn it. It is also the kind of song that inspires\npeople to pick up the guitar or at the least play air guitar. Sustain. Great tone. Twin leads.\nCool lyrics. All make for a classic song that belongs on your turntable, or CD player, or whatever.\n\nPut \"Jailbreak\" into your rotation and take a listen. Go ahead, break out now...","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"For one thing, I have to give Kesha credit for daring to try some songs without the use of autotune on this album in contrast to Animal. That might not be a bad thing, if she didn't sound even WORSE without it than with it. This proves that her ability as a singer is very limited at best, as is the case with all the other mainstream sound-alikes we have being produced just to make money off the masses. I will not blindly blame Kesha for 100% of this typical, generic-sounding, cookie-cutter dung heap; The majority of the blame goes to that loser known as Dr. Luke, who produces a handful of the other mainstream sound-alike puppets. He is a control freak beyond further investigation, and he never lets anyone whose records he produces have much of a say, if any at all.\n\nAlso, I know people might try to defend this atrocity by saying that it was meant to be funny and that I \"have no sense of humor,\" but when it gets to the point of becoming downright dirty and sexually explicit... that is when I no longer see the humor. If anything, it just makes me want to puke. Call me a prude all you want, but anything as sexually explicit as some of the lyrics on this album is an automatic turn-off for me. Sexual innuendo can be done tastefully, such as in the case of Depeche Mode, i.e. \"Let my body do the moving \/ Let my hands do the soothing....\" that is as far as it goes. Also, if I want some humor in music once in a while, Devo takes care of that just fine, thank you. At least their humorous elements, with a few exceptions, are actually CLEAN. The same can hardly be said about this album, I hate to say. It just goes to show the standards of what is deemed \"acceptable\" in today's society, as sad as it is.","classification":1,"fold":4}

{"text":"At the bargain price, I'm happy to have an amazing recording of the 1812 Overture. And there are 49 more \"bonus tracks\" as well.\n\nThe 1812 Overture is of course very well known, and this performance is a gem. The strings are very romantic, and the full orchestra is skilled and precise. The sound is excellent, and very well balanced. I'm a huge fan of the 1812, and many performances of it are in my library. This recording is superb.\n\nThe opening of this recording is slower than is common, and very romantic. The strings are very, very beautiful. Many performances of the 1812 use cannons and carillon in the finale; this one does not. Thundering bass drums replace the cannons, and orchestral bells replace the carillon. But that doesn't diminish this recording -- the brass is strong, and the finale sounds full.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're looking for an 1812 Overture that will show off your new 500-watt stereo and subwoofer, check out Erich Kunzel's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tchaikovsky-1812-Overture-etc-Kunzel-Cincinnati-Pops-Multichannel-Hybrid-SACD\/dp\/B00005AVNH\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tchaikovsky 1812 Overture etc. \/ Kunzel, Cincinnati Pops (Multichannel Hybrid SACD)<\/a>.

{"text":"Lianne La Havas returns with her second album which features even better vocal performances and a more refined sound than her accomplished debut. Produced by La Havas along with some other great musicians including Paul Epworth (Adele and U2) and Mark Batson (Dave Matthews Band), Blood is a great sounding album bursting at the seams with jazz, funk, soul, and R&B grooves that show an artist on the rise willing to experiment with styles whilst maintaining an entertaining appeal. Often compared to other brilliant female artists such as Jill Scott and Lauren Hill, Lianne La Havas seems to be maturing into a consummate professional able to toe the line of various genres with ease. The entire album is high quality and flows really well but a few highlights include the fun vibe of \"What You Don't Do\", the brilliant jazz influenced guitar ballad \"Ghost\", the funky groove and sweet horn arrangement of \"Midnight\", the beautiful yet sombre feel of \"Good Goodbye\", and the smooth ode to Jamaica \"Green & Gold\". At just over forty minutes, Blood is over much too soon but as the last notes ring out you definitely want to press repeat on a very satisfying and entertaining album. Blood is highly recommended to fans of quality female fronted neo soul and already makes me excited to hear what might come next for this exciting talent.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Robyn's Body Talk is the most interesting pop music I've heard in years. The closest I can come to describe it is to say it's like a combination of the oddness of Bjork, the confidence of Madonna or Lady Gaga, and the pop savviness of Roxette and Kylie Minogue. Much like Janelle Monae in the R&B genre, Robyn has found a way to innovate within the dance\/pop genre while making songs with sincere emotions and a clarity of vision that is maintained throughout the entire album. The hooks and melodies are memorable, and there's a wide variety of styles, featuring some excellent, often very clever lyrics. \"Call Your Girlfriend,\" for example, takes the perspective of \"the other woman\" in a relationship, giving advice on how a boyfriend should break up with his girlfriend in the most considerate way possible. This is a wonderful concept for a song, and everything else in the song backs up the idea perfectly. I consider it one of the best pop singles I've ever heard. Just as good is the first song here, \"Dancing On My Own,\" a beautiful and emotional song.\n\nMuch has been said already about how the three-part Body Talk releases came about, so I won't take time discussing that. Suffice it to say, all the releases are worth having, and I think this might just be the best of the bunch. I found the self-titled \"Robyn\" album to be excellent, if a little manic, and am pleased to say I think Body Talk is even better.

{"text":"Well, I saw Van Halen on Ellen and both nights on Jimmy.  I love it because I'm all about Eddie's guitar playing and Alex's drums.  Diamond Dave is entertaining to watch while listening to the jamming.  But this cd was better than I thought it'd be.  In fact, it's quite excellent.  Surprisingly, David's vocals are good on a lot of the songs.  The highlights are Dance the Night Away and Romeo Delight.  Great stuff.  David has flashes where he sounds like his old self.  I just don't think he can maintain it all the time - but why complain?  It is cool having Eddie and David together again.  I am going to se them this summer - I paid for a little bit cheaper seats and am a little back, but I want to be there.  I have never seen VH with Dave.  There are worse ways to spend a summer evening than listening to Eddie's masterful guitar work, and Diamond Dave jumping around with that big grin on his face.  These guys aren't 20 anymore.  Just enjoy it for what it is and quit complaining.  Eddie is the most influential guitarist in history along with Hendrix.  Enjoy it.  But bottom line, this cd is far better than it is getting credit for.  Oh, and Wolfgang does fine.  Yeah, I like Michael Anthony.  But give this kid credit and don't blame him for Michael not being there.  And the background vocals sound very good on this cd.  Wolfgang does a good job.  He's Eddie's kid.  Have some respect.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"These guys are responsible for putting rap in the mainstream. This was a mixed blessing because many good rap groups made their way into the scene,but along evolved the horrid incarnation of present hip hop today. This compilation contains many of the groups classic hits and all the songs are marked by very good beats and original rap flows from these early pioneers. I despise the trendy state of hip hop today because the genre is lacking originality and creativity. I would recommend this cd to any fans of the group or of old school rap.","classification":5,"fold":4}
{"text":"I just finished listening to The Endless River. I hear shades of Wish You Were Here, Obscured by Clouds, Meddle, The Division Bell, and (a very small bit of) The Final Cut, mixed with the emotions from what was obviously a tense time within the group (early 1990s). Instrumentals comprise 90% of the disk, and all have the signature Floyd sound so many of us know and love.\nThe last song on the CD is the only one with true vocals, and it gives a glimpse of the in-fighting the band was experiencing and their desire to keep going despite the conflict; the titles of a couple of the tunes also alludes to the friction within the group. Despite the underlying emotions within the songs, it is not filled with darkness. I would classify it as slightly somber (like they all realized their time together was coming to an end); but a lot of classic tunes from the previously mentioned albums had similar undertones meant to capture the emotions of events of the time. The length of most of the songs is under 3 minutes, and this gives a couple of the tunes an \"unfinished\" or \"rush-to-finish\" quality.\nKudos to the Band for including Stephen Hawking in another one of their tunes!\nI am a longtime Pink Floyd fan, so I pre-ordered the disk with no idea of the content, after reading a few comments made by former band back-ups.\nI am happy to say I am not disappointed. In fact, I'm thrilled to hear new tunes from one of the greatest rock bands of all time... despite the fact they all will probably never play on stage or in the studio again.\nIf Amazon had a 4.5-star rating, that's what I would give it.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"In an eighteen month period beginning in August 1965 a jug-band rock group formed by John Sebastian and Zalman Yanovsky reeled off 7 consecutive Top Ten hits. It was an impressive beginning for the group known as The Lovin' Spoonful. The group termed their approach \"good-time music\". Yet their biggest hit was a bit of a departure from that idea. \"Summer In The City\" spent a total of three weeks atop the Bill Hot 100 in August of 1966. This gritty tune features a series of car horns during the instrumental bridge, starting with a Volkswagen Beetle horn, and ends up with a jackhammer sound, in order to give the impression of the sounds of the summer in the city. Very different and extremely impressive. The song would sell more than a million copies and has been recognized by Rolling Stone as one of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All-Time\".  This is the original hit recording.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I didn't research this song, but the lead singer sounds just like Rare Earth's drummer\/singer (Peter Rivera), on the song \"I Just Want to Celebrate,\" which I have on my Amazon cloud player. I believe the guitarist who can do a spot-on imitation of Jimi Hendrix (Randy California) played in this group. A great song with a groovy, '60s sound and vibe :) *I know Randy California played the guitar in this group, but I was thinking of the guitarist Randy Hansen who does a spot-on impersonation of Jimi Hendrix. I was watching YouTube and stumbled upon a couple of videos of Randy playing Jimi Hendrix songs note for note.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Twenty years ago, at the end of 1994, MTV counted down 100 music videos of 1994 and gave the number one video position to the song Basket Case by Green Day from the CD Dookie. I used a magnifying glass to study the picture art on the cover of the CD jewel case and found the caption: twisted dog sister. The blimp in the upper left corner of the picture on the CD cover has the message: BAD YEAR. The CD is round and does not have the entire message, but the art on the CD itself clearly has bombs that are called DOOKIE. This CD was released in 1994 during the transition from January to February, so MTV had many opportunities to play the song Basket Case during the year 1994, and I think a special thrill was beheld internally at the idea of giving myself the creeps and my mind plays tricks on me. Basket Case was the Martin Luther Stonehood of 1994 expressing itself in punk rock, and people who have forgotten are like Americans who lack Hegel circling the present with the depth of its past.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"When it has really came down to Jason Mraz, he actually has been making some elequent songs that have absolutely delivered, not just in great melody, but keeps up showing why the best songs have something to say without too much of the hassle. Love Someone, the lead single from his upcoming album Yes, is definitely a good song. He still shows he is a great songwriter and a good singer. It follows through brilliantly the way that I'm Yours, and I won't Give Up had shown the past several years in his brilliant writing. This is a good song, and sounds much better than the joke songs that have overplayed on radio from Beyonce' Knowles, Katy Perry and Rihanna. If you haven't heard a Jason Mraz song before, you should download this song.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":4}

That has definitely shown with the songs from his latest record The Diving Board, and Home Again, the lead single from that album is definitely no exception. I love the mood and its simplicity from the keys pf Elton John's piano, to how the deepness of the song still hits from the down to Earth appeal of his classic songwriting and musicianship. It really is up there with all of the great songs that made Elton's dynasty strong like Your Song and Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me.

{"text":"Apart from a couple of reviews from way back around the turn of the century, whose authors hear flaws in this recording that I do not, nearly everyone concurs that ever since their recording fifty years ago, these performances have remained unequalled and unassailable. Of course there are are other excellent recordings of all three pieces (Giulini's \"Pictures\" with the Chicago SO and his \"La mer\" with the Philharmonia, for example) but as a collection this is a testament to both the sonority of the Berlin Philharmonic at its peak under Karajan and to that conductor's chameleon ability to empathise with and elucidate music from outside the late German Romantic tradition in which he excelled. His brief dalliance with the Orchestre de Paris confirms his attachment to French music and his ability to pace and colour both the Debussy and the Ravel emerges as a thing of wonder.\n\nThere is of course a neat link in the programming here between the Mussorgsky and \"Bolro\" as the composer of the latter orchestrated the \"Pictures\" brilliantly; originally these recordings, made between 1964 and 1966 in the warm ambiance of the Jesus-Christus-Kirche, were issued on two separate LPs, one of French music by Debussy and Ravel and the other with just the Mussorgsky and \"Bolro\". Any attempt at musical criticism of such seminal recordings would be superfluous after such a long time; it is sufficient to note that the delicacy and nuance of Karajan's evocation of the sea remain extraordinary, and the peroration of the \"Pictures\" in \"The Great Gate of Kiev\" remains one of the greatest expositions of the symphony orchestra in full flight ever committed to disc.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I didn't get my cd until after lunch and there was already 19 reviews on here and most were so negative that I was almost afraid to open the cd and give it a listen, BUT I AM GLAD I DIDN'T LISTEN TO ALL THE NEGATIVITY!!!!  I wasn't expecting a no holds barred prog fest of heavy metal.  This is a Concept Album, A Story, A Rock Opera and it is AWESOME!!!!! This is some of the greatest musicians in the world and the lyrics are wonderful.  Instead of the gloom and doom and death and sex and drugs that a lot of bands write about, THIS ALBUM IS A STORY OF LIFE AND HOPE!!!!!!  It may not be as heavy as some would like, but there is great guitar riffs all throughout the album and beautiful solos.  The music fits the story perfectly. I have been a DREAM THEATER fan since their first album and I am honored to have this FANTASTIC PIECE OF ART IN MY EXTENSIVE MUSIC COLLECTION....  A great album to pick you up when you are feeling down.  Looking forward to seeing this put together on stage and done in it's entirety live.  This album gives \"The Wall\" a run for it's money.  Everyone that is a Dream Theater fan and has nothing but negative remarks about this great album, please listen to it again with an open mind and let the music take you to a place of hope away from the pain and agony that surrounds us in this world.  Thank you for your time and give this wonderful piece of art a chance.  Just listen to it with no expectations and just listen to the music and the lyrics and relax and enjoy a couple of blissful hours..... God Bless You All and great job DREAM THEATER!!!!!!  I have now listened to the entire album ALL THE WAY THRU 7 TIMES... It gets better with each listen and you get something different out of the story with each listen.  This is a fantastic piece of art by a group of fantastic musicians and there are plenty of great GUITAR SOLOS spread throughout the album.  The second disc has more heavy songs than the first disc so all the people griping about the slow songs, plug in disc 2.....People gripe if the band does an album that sounds like previous albums and then gripe even more when the band does something different... SOME PEOPLE JUST LOVE TO GRIPE ABOUT EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Prime Cuts: I Desire Jesus, Beneath the Waters (I Will Rise), Cornerstone\n\nWhile many worship bands have come and gone, Hillsong Live's perennial releases have not only been top sellers but many of their songs have made their way into the song books of innumerable churches.  Part of the reason of such a steely success is that Hillsong has never indulged in carnivalesquous accoutrements. Rather, their songs have always been God centred informed by the richness of Scripture.  \"Cornerstone,\" their 21st live recording, is no different.  These 15 cuts (if you get the deluxe version) are just anthems of Scriptural truths made palatable in ways that the audience can sing along to in no time.  However, there are a three of departures with \"Cornerstone:\" first, Hillsong's front lady for many years Darlene Zschech is further pushed to the background.  Known for writing worship stables such as \"Worthy is the Lamb\" and \"Shout to the Lord,\" Zschech did not contribute any song here.  This is probably the first time since Hillsong Live's genesis that that has had happened.  Second, while many Hillsong's music has been marked by Zschech's angelic signature vocals, here Zschech only sings lead on one track (\"I Desire Jesus\").  Other than these misgivings, the third departure is more welcomed:  on this release, Hillsong have included a larger range of subjects in their songs.  Topics such as baptism, the second coming, the global explosion of the Gospel are deftly dwelt.\n\nIf you are thinking of saving a couple of bucks and only get the standard version of this disc, think twice.  The best track here is only found on the deluxe version.  \"I Desire Jesus,\" a track written by Brooke Fraser's husband Scott Ligertwood, is easily the cream of the crop.  Performed here by Darlene Zschech, this is a gorgeous ballad of worship that starts off with an angelic purity before building up to all stadium-cresting worship this is the type of worship music that entices our hearts to savior Jesus and his Cross intimately.  Brooke Ligertwood (better known as Brooke Fraser) is back - not as a vocalist but this time as a songwriter.  Her sole entry here is \"Beneath the Waters (I Rise).\"  Ligertwood who has been known for her intricate melodic structures and the shafts of theological depth has written one of Hillsongs' most theological profound songs here.  Tying together the theme of baptism and the resurrection together, `Beneath\" conveys such a truth in a powerful anthemic style.  Not to be missed is the title cut \"Cornerstone.\"  Just like their previous entry \"Incense\/Step by Step\" was an amalgamation of an old chorus with a new composition, \"Cornerstone\" seamlessly crafts together the hymn \"The Solid Rock\" with a newly composed song.\n\nAs with every Hillsong album, there are no shortages of crowd drawing bombastic rockers.  Album opener \"Endless Light\" features Jad Gillies on lead vocals leading us into an irresistible hooky beat driven uptempo celebrating the power of God's love.  Written and led by Matt Crocker, \"I Surrender\" has a brooding slow bluesy number about self abandonment to Jesus.  Made even more beautiful and touching are the subtle harmony vocals of Darlene Zshech.  Worship pastor Rueben Morgan takes up the microphone to sing about the global explosion of the Gospel via \"Hope of the World.\"  Apropos to the theme of the song, listen to how Morgan invites the audience to sing with him making this symbolically a global anthem.  Zesty and really fun is album closer \"Praise Him\" with the delightful \"whoo-oohs.\"\n\nNevertheless, with 15 tracks and having too many lead singers (especially too many male leads) the momentum is lost when we come to the last third of the album.  Ben Fieldings' \"Stand in Awe\" has so much echo of \"God is Able\" that it becomes repetitive and Joel Houston's \"Running\" lacks the bite to make it a standout.  Let's hope album 22 will find Darlee Zschech taking a more prominent lead - after all it's her voice that originally set Hillsong apart from the copious worship CDs out there. Nevertheless, \"Cornerstone\" is still an important block (and will be in the years to come) to worship music.  Be prepared to hear many of these songs sung across churches everywhere in the next few years to come.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"When The Killers took their brief hiatus from touring and recording during this period,\n  their lead singer- composer Brandon Flowers have decided to record and release a solo\n  album in 2010 as this first-time solo recording became an instant hit for this charismatic\n  and highly acclaimed rock composer.  Named after Flamingo Roadjust located in Las\n  Vegas where many pivotal events on his life occurred (Sams Town Hotel And Casino is\n  located on the same street and also met his first wife at a thrift store), Flamingo gives us\n  a brilliant solo performance by this great artist whose voice and songwriting have left an\n  indelible mark on the music world and gave the rock scene one of the most original and\n  most acclaimed rock bands to make its mark on the music world.  Directly tied with Los\n  Vegas in both showmanship and ideology, the deluxe edition of this highly versatile hit\n  is showcased with sparkling, stadium ready tracks which start off with the opening track\n  Welcome To Fabulous Las Vegas, as it proceeds well on Only The Young, Playing With\n  Fire, On The Floor and The Clock Was Tickin.  Plus, you even get a solid pair of tracks\n  that Brandon had teamed with Jenny Lewis, one of the finest rock composers, like Hard\n  Enough and Was It Something I Said? (with whom they both co-wrote together), as the\n  entire album run its successful gamut range from expert pop excursions and blues-rock\n  to forlorn-driven electronica and gospel sounds.  I have to highly recommend Flamingo\n  in its deluxe form, because it delivers a lyrical performance filled with heart and soul.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I'm not a country music fan but there is some that I like.  I've been a Cyndi Lauper fan since I was a kid, and buy everything she releases.  I was kind of disappointed when I heard she'd be making a country album of all things.  Though it's not a big surprise given that she has made several covers albums.  Cyndi has always done covers of songs, even with Blue Angel and on her solo albums.\n\nI knew if anyone could make a country album I might like, she could, so I pre-ordered.  I also bought the individual tracks that were released before the CD.  Cyndi has a way of adding humor and seriousness to her recordings.  I figured she would put some funny touches here and there with this one, and she does.  I'm previously familiar with some of the songs, while others I never heard.\n\n1.  \"Funnel of Love\"-Upbeat and almost rockabilly sound, reminds me of an amusement park on a summer day.  I like this one, it's catchy.  It gets stuck in my head but in a good way.  I like singing along to it.  A great opening track.  5\/5\n2.  \"Detour\" (featuring Emmylou Harris)-This isn't as good as the first track, but I like it.  Vintage sounding.  This has a sound of classic country music from the past.  Their voices sound good.  This is a song I would've hated when I was a kid, because it has that country twang that most non-country fans don't like, but I like it now.  4\/5\n3.  \"Misty Blue\"-A nice ballad, sad, good fit for Cyndi's serious side.  It fits in her catalog with some other ballads she's done.  Melancholy.  5\/5\n4.  \"Walkin' After Midnight\"-The classic Patsy Cline song that we all know.  Cyndi does it justice.  She doesn't stray too far from the original.  I don't know if Patsy fans would like it, I tend to enjoy Patsy's more too, but I love this one also.  One of my favorites on the album.  5\/5\n5.  \"Heartaches by the Number\"-The first song released from the album.  Catchy and kind of fun.  One of the more memorable tracks here.  5\/5\n6.  \"The End of the World\"-I already knew this song as an oldies tune from the 50s.  I never knew it was a country song.  It's never been a favorite of mine, and Cyndi's version isn't much different.  But I prefer Cyndi's cover.  3\/5\n7.  \"Night Life\" (featuring Willie Nelson)-This one is okay.  Willie Nelson's voice sounds different than what I'm used to, since I'm not familiar with his more recent work.  It's not a song I'll play often.  3\/5\n8.  \"Begging to You\"-Another good one.  Another somewhat sad ballad.  Like all the songs here, Cyndi makes it her own.  5\/5\n9.  \"You're the Reason Our Kids Are Ugly\" (featuring Vince Gill)-I feel I should explain my low rating of this track.  This song is kind of funny about a squabbling couple who pick on each other but stay together because in the end they love each other.  But the title of the song bothers me a little, because I have a personal childhood trauma involving getting bullied as a small child and one girl always calling me names including \"ugly\" for no reason other than that she was cruel and vicious.  So I kind of feel bad listening to a song saying kids are ugly.  Even though I get the humor and message of the song.  I like that they are saying looks and money don't matter.  But it's my least favorite song on the album.  2\/5\n10.  \"I Fall to Pieces\"-I really like this one.  I knew the original but I think I like this version better.  It's a very good cover.  5\/5\n11.  \"I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart\" (featuring Jewel)-I used to be a Jewel fan (still like some of her songs).  I'm not a fan of yodeling, but it suits this song so I don't mind it.  The part when Cyndi says, \"Yippee Ay Yay\" mid-way through the song is hilarious.  It's one of those Cyndi moments that is classic Cyndi Lauper and just makes you laugh!  Cyndi's voice sounds different during the song, but when that part comes in, she sounds like Cyndi from the 80s.  5\/5\n12.  \"Hard Candy Christmas\" (featuring Alison Krauss)-I wasn't familiar with Dolly's version before hearing this.  I know of the film but have never watched the entire movie because it doesn't interest me.  I already have the single version of this, which has Cyndi solo on the vocals while this one is a duet.  I like the solo one better but there isn't much difference.  If you're like me and don't care about the film or story, the song has it's own meaning.  This is a nice, but again sad, song about a woman in tough times thinking of making changes in her life and doing things, but not really sure she will.  Maybe I'll do this, maybe I'll try that.  Leaves you wondering if she does or not.  It's relatable to anyone unsure of what they are doing in life.  5\/5\n\nOverall I enjoy the album.  The highlights are Funnel of Love, Walkin' After Midnight, Heartaches by the Number, and I Fall to Pieces.  Cyndi's voice still sounds the same-she's always been able to interpret songs in various ways.  At times on Detour, like on I Want to be a Cowboy's Sweetheart, she sounds very different.  But it works.  I think this album is a lot better than Memphis Blues.  While there are some songs on there that I like, I hardly listen to it.  It's been interesting to see how Cyndi has tried many genres.  Who would have thought back in the 80s and early 90s that she would one day do a country record.  I like that it doesn't sound too modern, she stays true to old country music.  The retro sound works.\n\nThere are some fans who won't even give Detour a try because they dislike country, or because they didn't like Memphis Blues.  They want dance or pop Cyndi back.  I think Detour is very good and I'll be listening to it during the summer.  But I definitely would like to hear her do another album of original pop\/rock songs, like her 80s albums or her dance album Bring Ya to the Brink from 2008.  Maybe she lost interest in that and wants to do as many different cover albums as she can.  But many of us fans would love to hear more original songs.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Fifteen years is a long time between albums, but the Bangles have successfully managed to avoid sounding either like ripoffs of themselves or like something totally alien. They are truly back in form, with the slickness factor turned way down from Everything (though this is by no means All Over The Place, Volume 2).\nI am most impressed by the Peterson sisters' work on this album. I like Michael's \"Nickel Romeo,\" but her other songs here don't make much of an impression on me. Susanna sounds great as ever, but seems to be content mostly sticking to ballads (\"Something That You Said\", \"I Will Take Care of You\", \"Grateful\"). Not that these aren't great tracks, but she sounded great on the uptempo numbers from the early days. But Debbi turns in some of her best Bangles performances, period, on \"Ask Me No Questions\" and \"Here Right Now,\" and Vicki sounds great on \"Single by Choice,\" which I take not to be a defiant song of independence but something more akin to Simon & Garfunkel's \"I Am A Rock.\" And am I the only one who thinks she sounds like Shania Twain on \"Mixed Messages\"? As for \"The Rain Song,\" great stuff--but I have to say I liked the Continental Drifters' arrangement better. If only Vicki had been given the lead instead of Susan!\nThe ensemble vocals on \"Ride the Ride\" and \"Stealing Rosemary\" sound superb as well, and the instrumental playing is top-notch throughout. Vicki's mandolin is a nice touch.\nMy only criticism of this album is that it's a bit long. Not all of these songs are essential--I might have shortened Doll Revolution by dropping \"Lost at Sea,\" \"Song for a Good Son,\" and \"Between the Two.\"\nI understand some of these songs have been floating around for years--indeed, some have been recorded and released before--so it will be interesting to see if the fifth album, if there is one, can measure up to Doll Revolution. But even if it doesn't--who ever thought there would be a fourth?","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"La Havas impressive debut, Is Your Love Big Enough?, was rife with layers of overdubbed vocals and intricate arrangements atop a funk foundation.  Blood is just as well-crafted, but often moves from intricate to intimate.  Many songs float on fingerpicked acoustic guitar figures, then leap into deeper waters of horn-driven R&B (Midnight), Motown girl-group giddiness (What You Dont Do), or even industrial colors (Never Get Enough).  Counterbalancing these are quietly whispered gems like Wonderful and Good Goodbye.  Throughout, La Havas vocals are poised, precious, or punchy  sometimes all three.  Princes influence is subtle, but everywhere.  Yet, with only two albums to her name, La Havas has found a sound, one irresistibly her own.  Shes no longer just an artist to watch.  Shes a force majeure with real music in her blood.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"There are honestly times were a duet feels like it is a waste on the ears, heart and soul. That sadly has been the case with Ciara. Her recent collaborations for Fantasy Ride have felt more like a waste on the mind, and lagging behind chemistry. That showed with Never Ever with Young Jeezy, and here with Justin Timberlake on Love Sex Magic. The third single from Fantasy Ride feels like it is honestly a flavor of the moment, and doesn't spark for anything beyond magic. I really wasn't impressed with the song at all. I think that Ciara really as well as Justin Timberlake needs to find better songs to collaborate to. For Justin, this ranks well behind the other collaborations from a few years ago. As for Ciara, none of the songs worked for Fantasy Ride at all. Lets hope the next album shines better than a soul of ecstasy.\n\nSong: D-","classification":2,"fold":4}
{"text":"Trainor is trying out a lot of new stuff on this new album that is a departure from her unique sound on her debut album. Some of it is working. Some of it isn't.\n\nMe Too is closer to her vocal sound from her earlier work with a slightly new background sound. This track is working. It's a fun sound.\n\nThe lyrics follow her standard \"I'm confident in myself and don't need you to validate me\" theme. This one is almost to the point of narcissism. If someone was speaking these lyrics to me I'd laugh at them for being that full of themselves. But it makes for a great song!

{"text":"This is a great CD release by the legendary prolific multi-talented singer-songwriter Prince, titled \"20TEN\". The CD is a much better release on overall than the previous 3 CD releases (2 CDs by Prince & 1 CD by Bria Valente, his prote'ge' & girlfriend, titled \"Lotusflow3r, Mplsound, Elixir\"). The CD opens up with \"Compassion\" : a great opening track with great (music, vocals, chorus & harmonies). \"Beginning Endlessly\" is a good track with entrance\/opening sound reminiscent of song \"Lolita\" (from CD '3121'). \"Future Soul Song\" is a solid track\/gem : a beautiful laid-back song with wonderful (melody, chorus, harmonies & guitar) . This song is reminiscent of the great ballad \"Future Baby Mama\" (from CD 'Planet Earth\"). This is my favourite track from this great CD \"20TEN\" & hence the title of my review. \"Stick Like Glue\" is a great track with Prince producing guitar chords that were prominent in his songs in the 80s. These guitar chords later in the song become beautifully melodical (like Jack Johnson's \"From The Clouds\" from CD 'To The Sea'). \"Act Of God\" & \"Laux\" are good tracks, 'typically' Prince. \"Walk In Sand\" is a great laid-back track\/ballad : wounderful music & vocals. A similar track is \"Sea Of Everything\" with the beautiful Prince signature screams. \"Everybody Loves Me\" is a great 'naughty\/funny' number reminiscent of \"Wish U Heaven\" (from CD 'LoveSexy') or better \"The One U Wanna C\" (from CD 'Planet Earth\" : great melody with simple but yet very effective lyrics. The closing track (track 77, is a good rap\/hip hop track). On overall, this is a great CD release & offering from the 'His Purple Highness', pity this CD is not easily available due to 'promotional release' in European newspapers as well as Prince's pronouncement that 'Internet Is Dead'. A highly recommended listening if you could lay your hands on the CD \"20TEN\".","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"The most accomplished progressive rock band of all time return with their second concept album featuring over two hours of music spread across two discs. Produced by John Petrucci and engineered by Richard Chycki, the concept revolves around a story to stop evil technology overcoming the human power of music. The story was conceived and written by John Petrucci and the music is all written by Petrucci and Jordan Rudess. Unfortunately both John Myung and Mike Mangini were not involved in the songwriting process although their musical performances are front and center as always. The album is a great achievement for a band that has done it all and definitely shows a huge amount of ambition and scope but it does feel at times like we have heard this all before from Dream Theater. In addition, it's a little underwhelming having only two band members involved in the songwriting process. Despite these shortcomings, The Astonishing is an interesting concept with lots of great music and features an incredible vocal performance by James Labrie who brings each character to life with his vocal inflections. This album would probably be more satisfying when performed live as part of a theatrical performance of the story in order to bring some visual component to the musical onslaught and production values. Although there really is a lot to like about The Astonishing it's also a bloated affair and doesn't really feel like it has the same level of replay value as other Dream Theater albums - 3.5 stars.","classification":3,"fold":4}

{"text":"When vibraphonist Jackson accepted a recording date with pianist Peterson in 1961, along came the other two members of Oscar's trio, Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums. While bass and drums remain in the background of this excellent CD, Brown and Thigpen were great players, and add a lot to the success of this effort. The opener, \"Green Dolphin Street\" is relaxed, but \"Heartstrings\" and \"Work Song\" jump. Then comes the wonderful, almost eight-minute take on \"John Brown's Body\" that soars. The final two cuts, \"A Wonderful Guy\" and \"Reunion Blues\" are also superb. Milt and Oscar, of course, went on to do great work up to the mid-90's, but they were already old pros 41 years ago. If you have a friend who is afraid of jazz, play this for him or her. It's a perfect blend of the four instruments and a great introduction to the category.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I put this CD on my wish list, not knowing much about the artist.  My daughter got it for me as a birthday present.  Wow!  I'm completely floored by how much I like this CD.  It's incredibly strong.  \"Rattle My Bones\" blasts off the set with a tune penned by Brandi Carlisle.  Its insistent beat & Laura & Lydia Rogers' tight harmonies make the track shimmer, \"There's no telling what I'd do if I could get my hands on you, I want you & don't know why, But now I know I'd like to try.\"  Carlisle guests again as a co-writer with the Rogers sisters on \"Black & Blue\" that has a gorgeous retro-Brill Building-60s feel with a strong melody, pumping beat, and tight harmony, \"If you believe me then it's not too late; And I'll be praying all the while I wait, I still belong to you.\"  Gurf Morlix who has played with Lucinda Williams and so many other top-notch acts joins the sisters on electric guitar on \"I Cannot Find A Way\" that is sure to bring female Everly Brothers comparisons with the tight harmonies.  \"Good Luck, Good Night, Goodbye\" is another retro-pop gem with its effervescent keyboards sounding like a coffee percolator, \"I know it's not a perfect world, but tonight I'm the perfect girl, I had a man but he just lied, good luck, good night, goodbye.\"  While these are my VERY favorites, all of the rest of the tracks are incredibly strong.

{"text":"Cher's newest offering is 2001's LIVING PROOF, this is the version that was released in the UK before the US got a copy. The UK version features \"You Take It All\", which in my opinion, is the best track of the album. Instead the US version has \"When You Walk Away\", which is not available on this UK version. Cher once again provides some songs with inspiration and strength, like \"Alive Again\", \"Song For The Lonely\", \"Love One Another\", which all have messages of love and acceptance and moving on. Another favorite track of mine is the dark techno sounding \"Love Is A Lonely Place Without You\". The only songs I couldn't get into are the latin influenced \"Body To Body, Heart To Heart\", and \"Rain, Rain\". The rest of the tracks are winners, however I feel there could have been a better choice for a single than \"When The Money's Gone\". I love her version of \"The Music's No Good Without You\", which was the first UK single, a nice dark trance type track. \"Real Love\" stands out, it has a nice Daft Punk-ish sound to it.

{"text":"This album was recommended to me because I'm a fan of Zella Day and Meg Myers. I like their darker tones, the honesty in their lyrical content and just the overall depth of the music, and I was hoping and expecting much of the same from this. Musically, I have no complaints. It has a very good dark pop tone to it, great grooves, easy to get into. Vocally, again, sounds good, she has that dark tonal quality. My issue with the album is the lyrical content, it just seems hollow. The lyrics just seem very generic and not very personal at all. Many of the songs, including New Americana, and Strange Love, just have really generic and overdone meanings. Forget everyone, I'm better than them, I'm going to do what I want. Well high five, good for you.\nZella Day and Meg Myers actually feel like they are writing their music from experience. It's less about conveying a idea, and more about expressing their emotions through their past, and how they've learned to move on. They are songs people can listen to, and relate to, and apply to their own situations to hopefully find some healing in whatever difficulty they face. Halsey on the other hand neglects these things. While still \"dark pop\", the majority of songs are more about being the person you want to be and giving the finger to anyone who disagrees. This would be a fine sentiment, however, it has been so overused, and the message so abused that it is really just rendered repetitive and unoriginal.","classification":2,"fold":4}

Like its companions WHAT'S NEW and FOR SENTIMENTAL REASONS, it captures the multi-faceted soprano buoyed by Nelson Riddle's big band stylings. Riddle, the former Frank Sinatra arranger, employs such luminaries as Louie Bellson, Peter Asher and Don Grolnick to aid Ronstadt along the journey. Ronstadt's interpretations range from the delightful and playful to sassy and romantic. At times the orchestration can get a little too sweet, but Ronstadt sings such faves as \"When I Fall In Love,\" \"Skylark,\" \"Sophisticated Lady,\" \"Falling In Love Again,\" \"Lush Life\" and \"You Took Advantage Of Me\" with enough charm and grace to overshadow some of Riddle's overly ambitious arrangements.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Say hello to the final studio album by Royksopp. Or say goodbye. I'm not sure which is more appropriate. In any case, the good news is that the Norwegian duo isn't going to stop making music; they're just saying goodbye to the traditional album format, as the trend of digital cherry-picking makes the concept not quite as lucrative as in the days when you actually had to buy a physical object to get your music.\n\nTheir name (kinda\/sorta) means \"mushroom.\" Depending on which interview you've read, they're referring to mushrooms of either the magical or the cloud variety. Both are fairly oblique symbols for their work, which has always had an emotionally devastating sort of trippiness to it. But even when their songs were about melancholy subjects, they've always contained this electro-techno-spark of life that made them not just catchy, but also invigorating. Heck, their big hit from JUNIOR was all about a terminally lonely woman who was married to a workaholic who never came home, and it was a summer dance hit in spite of its gloomy lyrics.\n\nAnd that is (just one of) the beautiful things about their music: it has run the gamut from lushly atmospheric, to a sort of melodic mental massage, to a kind of charge for cheerfulness, to even a revelry in introspection. If that makes any sense. They've never had a bad album, in my opinion, and most of their work treads that tricky line between being gloomy and celebratory.\n\nNot so here. This is definitely a sad album. It is, however, a really good sad album. I'm not sure where the darkness comes from -- maybe it's the eulogy for the album as a format -- but whatever the case, the grimness takes off from track one, Skulls, which sounds almost like an android's war cry. Next is my favorite track on the album (not the least because it features frequent guest vocalist Robyn, whom I love), Monument. This song sounds almost victorious, but the lyrics are almost overwhelmingly sad. I don't know what it is about this song, but it hits me every time like I've taken an upper and a downer at the same time. I mean that as a compliment. A big one.\n\nThe rest of the album follows suit. There are the tender moments that Royksopp is so good at (Sordid Affair and You Know I Have To Go), as well as the songs that sound like pre-party anthems until you really listen to what they're talking about (Save Me and I Had This Thing). And, of course, there's the usual batch of beautiful instrumental pieces (especially in the bonus disc of \"prologue\" recordings). It's a lovely but devastating album. Call me a softy, but it's made my eyes tear up more than once.\n\nA lot of the Royksopp music is definitely trippy in the magic mushroom way, but this album is most closely akin to the mushroom cloud interpretation of their name. Powerful, unyielding, and even beautiful in its own way, this is a fantastic fireball of a record, and a great way for the band to say goodbye to one era (and hopefully hello to another, equally productive, world).","classification":5,"fold":4}

As one grew to fame they moved off that station, and the next went on, Indigo Girls got started that way. Tracy Chapman too. All good music (Yes including Pearl and Nirvana) (Splash water on her she will be OK, just not use to Nirvana and the Indigo Girls being called good at the same time) (And yes I know I have my years messed up go with it) The point is Jewel is good, just give this a listen.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Earl Scruggs, Doc Watson and Ricky Skaggs team up on what has to be as good as bluegrass music gets. You will play this one again and again. This hauntingly beautiful CD reminded me once again that most of the so-called music coming out of Nashville today masquerading as \"country\" and\/or \"bluegrass\" is pure (junk). No tight jeans and cowboy hats here. Just first class music.\nThe pickers play a lot of older songs: \"What Would You Give In Exchange For Your Soul,\" \"Who Will Sing For Me,\" \"Soldier's Joy,\" \"The Storms Are On The Ocean,\" \"Foggy Mountain Top,\" \"Roll In My Sweet Baby's Arms.\" These men are as good as pickers get. Having Alison Krauss join them on some of the cuts only makes this CD better.\nDifficult as it is to pick a favorite, I would probably vote for \"Down In The Valley To Pray.\" Doc Watson begins this hymn, as simple and pure as your grandmother's pound cake, and is then joined by the voices of Skaggs and Scruggs, along with Krauss, in an a capella arrangement that will send chills down your spine. You are immediately carried back to a one-room church 50 or 60 years ago. The songleader began a hymn and then one by one, the congregation joined in while mothers fanned their babies with funeral home fans.

{"text":"\"You'll see perpetual change...\"\n\nIn 2008, Yes vocalist Jon Anderson found himself ill and unable to tour for quite some time. The remaining band members decided to continue onward, hiring Yes tribute singer (with some prog cred in Canadian band Mystery) Benoit David. Able to capture Anderson's high-vocaled tenor quite well in concert, things went as well as could be hoped for as Yes toured for the next few years. Rick Wakeman had also departed again during this period (for the, um, 5th time), and his son Oliver took over on keyboards.\n\nYes has always been, from the very first departure of Peter Banks in 1970, a revolving door of players. We all have our favorite albums and lineups, but what always baffled me was seeing\/hearing comments by various fans who\ncannot seem to ever accept what is right in front of them, here and now.\n\nMaybe I am just less biased, having discovered Yes as recently as 1998, and I wasn't overexposed towards one particular band member or sound. My first Yes albums that I purchased that summer covered the span from the late 60s to the 90s, so I became a pluralist early on.\n\nOne of my early favorites was Drama. I paid $ 1.99 for an old beat up cassette of it at a used record store, and I'll never forget the first time I heard \"Into The Lens\" as I played it in the car. There was so much darkness, sadness, and emotion in the song. At the time, I had no idea who was singing or playing...to me it was just amazing prog music, and I accepted it at face value.\n\nI quickly formed an emotional connection to Drama, and while I also loved 90125, Close To The Edge, Talk, and countless other albums, I never understood the absolute rancor and negativity towards it. Especially coming as it does after Tormato (which has far fewer good songs, and perhaps Wakeman's ugliest keyboard tones, and Jon Anderson's weakest singing and lyrics up to that point), I couldn't see how anyone could comparitively dislike it.\n\nEverytime I saw Yes tour, I hoped and prayed, but they never played anything from the album (aside from maybe a quick snippet of \"Tempus Fugit\" during the \"Whitefish\" solo.) I never had the chance to ask Jon Anderson about it, but whenever I would bring it up at band signings to Alan White or Chris Squire, I would get an embarassed grin and some half-mumbled comment. It was like a kid asking for a toy, and a parent saying \"someday\", which really was a subtext for \"never.\"\n\nAs luck would have it, not only would Yes start performing Drama material again on recent post-Anderson tours (\"Machine Messiah\" and \"Tempus Fugit\"), but Oliver Wakeman was unceremoniously dropped, and Geoff Downes -- my favorite keyboard player, Buggle extraordinaire, and Asia flame-keeper -- would rejoin the band for the first time in 30 years.\n\nWith Drama-era singer Trevor Horn producing (himself famously responsible for producing 90125 and Big Generator in the 80s, which kickstarted Yes into a whole new fanbase), Fly From Here suddenly sounded very exciting...\n\nRegarding the split of Anderson and Wakeman...I will always enjoy their music, and their hugely important contributions to Yes. But they alone are not Yes. And quite frankly, much of their solo work bores me. I wish them the best, and I am excited about their project with Trevor Rabin for 2012, but I am objectively critical of their supposedly god-like status in Yes.\n\nWakeman hasn't had a single tasteful keyboard patch since 1972 (his playing is unvarnished thankfully), and Anderson's singing and lyrics (despite many exceptions along the way), hasn't done much for me in almost as long.\n\nNow, onto the music...\n\n\"Fly From Here\" is the album's 20+ minute title track, broken down into smaller sections. Beginning softly (and with a piano motif that almost brings to mind \"White Car\"), we launch into \"Overture\". Perhaps the highlight of the album for me, this is Yes at their epic best, firing on all cylinders. Piano is mixed with sighing 80s-style synth, and reverbed triggered drum effects create a forward movement as Chris Squire's chunky, thumping bass keeps a steady pulse. Right away it is clear that Trevor Horn's production has treated us to the best-sounding Yes album in quite some years, as far as clarity and space between instruments and vocals.\n\nThis intro smoothly transitions into \"We Can Fly\". Written in 1980 by Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes just prior to the Drama sessions, it was demoed and played live on the subsequent tour. Heard for many years on various bootleg recordings (and finally given an official release in 2005 on the boxed set The Word Is Live), it was introduced onstage as being \"on the followup to Drama\", which was ostensibly planned for 1981. This Yes lineup dissapated, however, and interestingly enough...30 years later...things have come full circle, and you could very well describe Fly From Here as that followup album, seeing as how it has 4\/5ths of the Drama lineup, and with Trevor Horn as a primary influence in the writing and recording.\n\n\"We Can Fly\" has beautiful keyboard and piano melodies, and the harmony vocals are gorgeous. New vocalist Benoit David asserts himself wonderfully, somewhat surprisingly sounding less like Jon Anderson and a bit more like Trevor Horn (more Parallels!)\n\n\"Sad Night at the Airfield\" (previously heard as a shorter demo by The Buggles) begins with some somber acoustic guitar by Steve Howe. It explodes with melody as the line \"...Of air, that clouds in the night as we breathe.\" This is one of the most gorgeous moments on the album, as the old Drama elements resurface again (Squire's bass, and Downes' old Fairlight keyboard.) This section is the highlight of the album for me, as the next verse brings everything a step higher, Howe joins in on pedal steel, and the vocals and keyboards reach a crescendo of esquisite beauty.\n\nThis is one of those stamped and trademarked \"Yes moments\", akin to the musical peaks found in \"And You And I\", \"The Revealing Science of God\", \"Endless Dream\", or \"Awaken.\"\n\nWe return to the original piano motif as we explode into \"Madman at the Screens\", which is basically the \"Overture\" extended with more instrumentation and lyrics. The music is joyful, bouncy, and dramatic, as it moves between the dynamics of darkness and beauty. The overall structure is very pop-oriented, and the little xylophone-type keyboard tones unconciously make me recall the best moments of ABBA. Near the end of the song, some classic Hammond organ joins in. And is that a Taurus bass pedal I hear?\n\n\"Bumpy Ride\" comes next, perhaps the most \"oddball\" moment in the suite. This has a strong Howe influence in the bouncy, quirky playing and guitar tone, and subtly reminds me of something that might have been heard on his\nfirst two solo albums. A fun mostly instrumental segment, it again moves from light to shade and back again. I'm very much also reminded of a sound that could have come from the Tormato album.\n\nWith a sudden changeover (almost too unexpected and odd, IMO) \"We Can Fly - Reprise\" ends the song suite as it began. Although not the most climactic ending on a Yes epic, it gets the job done.\n\n\"The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be\" is a good mid-tempo ballad, which grows on me more with each listen. Chris Squire handles the lead on this, and his vocals have always been underrated in the Yes recipe, as far as I'm concerned. This song is reminiscent of material on his 1975 solo album Fish Out Of Water, again recalling the past...\n\n\"Life On A Film Set\" is classic symphonic prog. The beginning of the song is highly similiar to any number of acoustic ballads to be found on the early albums by Yes, King Crimson, or ELP. The production and sound gets\nmore dense as it moves forward, moving from moody balladry to bouncy and joyful moments. When I sit back and objectively pay attention to all of the song elements, it really captures the Yes that I know and love so\nwell. A bouncy, fun, beautifully-layered song as only they could do it.\n\n\"Hour of Need\" is classic Steve Howe again, featuring his Porteguese guitar, which brings back memories of \"I've Seen All Good People\", \"Wonderous Stories\", \"Sketches In The Sun\", and \"Nine Voices.\" The harmony vocals are (again) gorgeous, and the moog keyboards join in tastefully here and there. This is Classic Yes, in the wonderful tradition of Fragile and Going For The One.\n\n\"Solitaire\" is an acoustic guitar piece, this time featuring Steve by himself. Howe's solo moments are always tasteful, refined, quirky, and reflective, and this one is no exception. This is very much in the same\nouvre as \"Mood For A Day\" and \"Masquerade.\"\n\n\"Into The Storm\" features songwriting contributions from all band members, and again with the bubbly bass guitar, piano, harmonies, and keyboards, sounds like something from the 1977-80 period. An upbeat, positive ending to the album.\n\nAs far as individual contributions, I would say that Squire's bass-playing and singing is top-notch as it has been for ages, Steve Howe sounds very refined, fiery and confidant (see what health food and meditation can do for you, kids?), and Geoff Downes does a good simple job of bringing in his poppy, quirky Buggles keyboards, while still retaining the classic Yes motifs of mini-moog, Hammond, and mellotron. Only Alan White (on drums) sounds a little subdued, but he has a few interesting textural shuffles and grooves.\n\nOverall, I think it is fair to say that Fly From Here is the (overall) best Yes album since 90125, and slightly edges out ahead of The Ladder, which (especially in retrospect) was quite amazing itself. It certainly sounds like the followup to Drama (in some parallel universe 1981.) Let's call it Drama 2.0.\n\n\"One word can bring you 'round...changes.\"\n\nYes will always be different things to different people. Its overall dynamic is sort of like a diamond...there are a lot of rough edges and dark spots, but turn it around slightly and you will see joyful, crystalline moments as well. To me, it's always been about the message of positivity, relationships, love, and change. Being truly progressive; trying new things, new approaches, new styles. Mixing some Indian raga with some country music. Some techno-pop with some arena rock. Some church choirs with some classical granduer.\n\nI am just extremely tired of how the band and their legacy have carried onward through the years. The group spent so many years chasing hit singles after the success of \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", and became blinded by management, technology, and money. Relations broke down, factions formed, and no one seemed to know how to capture the original band spirit of five guys sitting in a living room or barn, and just brainstorming and writing some music together on a set of drums, piano and acoustic guitar. Yes unconciously stopped believing in themselves, and the fans followed suit. When in doubt, keep it simple. And just do it.\n\nFly From Here is a fantastic album, and a great reminder of sounds and places that remind you of a distant past, while still looking over that distant horizon. Remember...We can fly...","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Cher's follow-up release to her blockbuster album \"Believe\" was \"Living Proof.\"  It is another album in the dance\/club music vein, though it is a darker and much more cynical collection than \"Believe.\"  Cher pulls it off beautifully though.\n\nRight before this album came out, 9\/11 happened.  Cher dedicates the tribute song \"A Song For the Lonely\" to the \"Courageous People of New York\" who endured through the horrible event. When I last saw her in concert (Farewell Tour, 2005, Glendale AZ) and this video was shown in the ampitheater, I was struck by the WTC symbolism and how moving the song was.  This CD has a link to the video and it is definitely worth watching.\n\nI think \"Believe\" was a much-more commercially viable disc than \"Living Proof,\" though I think that \"Living Proof\" is a more powerful recording. It also took me a few listenings for me to really start to like it.  It's packed with great songs.  I always thought that Diane Warren's \"Body to Body, Heart to Heart\" should have been released as a single.\n\nThe record company antics of releasing different versions of the disc in the U.S. and Europe are a bit tiresome: the European versions contained additional songs and short-changed U.S. fans.  The same company did the same thing with the \"It's A Man's World\" disc in the mid-90s.  It's all about the bucks, I know, but enough is enough.","classification":5,"fold":4}

He placed nearly 40 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 Pop charts and for over two decades was a fixture on Billboard's Top Country Singles chart. And the man could croon with the best of them! Ray Stevens certainly made his mark on the American music scene. Much like the late Charlie Rich, another incredibly gifted and versatile performer, Ray Stevens might have achieved even greater commercial success had he concentrated on just one or two genres. But there were simply too many sides to Ray Stevens to allow that to happen. And he was a very gifted songwriter to boot.\n\nIn April 1969 Monument records released what just might be Ray's most creative and entertaining tune ever. \"Gitarzan\" is a novelty song about a character who lives in the jungle and forms a musical band with his female partner, Jane and their pet monkey. The song features Tarzan yells, scat singing, and a funky Boogie Woogie, as well as a quote from the song \"Swinging on a Star\", with the line \"Carrying Moonbeams Home in a Jar\" sung with the wrong notes. The song reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1969. Tons of fun!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Prime Cuts:  Title, Lips are Moving, Dear Future Husband\n\nReading like the pages lifted from a teenage girl's diary, \"Title\" is going to be strike a chord with most teenage girls.  Fans of Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, and Katy Perry are definitely clamoring for its release.  Nevertheless, the discerning parents need not be stricken with fear.  Though Trainor explores issues pertain to most (teenage) girls, such as boys, self-image, premarital sex, and what to look out for in a potential husband, she does not opine niggling and fatuous jabs.  Rather, with a wisdom that belies her 21 years of living,\n\n\"Title\" is rifled with advice that can be affirming, liberating, useful, and even counter-cultural.\nBut the major draw of this new record is not just in its accessibility and its relevancy, it's the melodies.  Remember the time when music is popular because they have such indelible melodic structures that they are almost universally known?  Evergreen gems such as Mariah Carey's \"Vision of Love\" or Whitney Houston's \"Greatest Love of All\" have such distinctive tunes that most people on the street can hum to them as soon as the song's titular is mentioned.  Trainor tries, on this album, to bring melody back to songs.  And in this regard, she has excelled.\n\nOne of the song that has already been a summer jam last year is \"All About that Bass.\"  Lyrically in the ballpark of Colbie Caillat's \"Try,\" \"All About the Bass\" gives the thumbs up to heavier set women in what is a female empowerment song.  Yet, what has propelled this song into a multi-platinum status is the song's ingenuous sound.  Utilizing a reggae-samba based over its shimmering melody, \"All About the Bass\" is in a class of its own.  If you think \"Bass\" is infectious, take a listen to the title cut \"Title.\"  Offering sisterly advice of not settling for a man who refuses to commit in marriage, \"Title\" is lyrically a props up in a milieu of sleazy sex-crazed songs.  \"Dear Future Husband\" equally finds Trainor refusing to lower her criterion as far as her future mate is found.  \"Husband\" has an echo-y vinyl-scratching intro that has throwbacks to the gorgeous sounds of the 50s that certainly add to the charm.\n\nFrom its retro reverbs, the hand claps, and the insanely catchy melody, \"Lips are Moving,\" Trainor's sophomore single solidifies the fact that Trainor is no one hit wonder.  And she does get away from the sugary bubble-gum pop with her duet with John Legend.  \"Not Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" has a 90s Babyface-quiet storm R&B balladry feel quipped with a slurred rock beat.  Again it's the melody here that wins the day.  While the sparse \"Close Your Eyes\" finds a breathy Trainor on a more relaxed almost rootsy Americana terrain showing her versatility to cross-pollinate genres.  \"Walkashame\" is a blatant put down of the frivolity of casual sexual relationships, albeit done in a big-band jazzy style awash with lots of brassy horns and piquant observations.\n\nGiven the fact that most pop records are skimpy when it comes to melodic structures, \"Title\" is a breath of fresh air.  This debut record reminds us of the albums made in music's golden eras of the past where melodies rule.  And add to the fact that Trainor has a winsome way of speaking to the hearts of her younger demographic; this is a win-win album regardless of how you see it.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews about David Archuleta's Christmas disc, I decided to go ahead and purchase it.\n\nEven though it was much better than his debut disc, it didn't blow me off my feet as it did some of the other reviewers.  He has a nice voice and good diction, but he tends to be a bit too stylized on some of the Christmas carols, as well as with some of the sacred classics, such as \"O Holy Night\" and \"Ave Maria.\"\n\nHe does a wonderful take on some of the lesser known Christmas carols, such as \"Pat-A-Pan\" and \"Riu Riu Chiu,\" as well as with \"Melodies of Christmas,\" which makes its debut on this album.  The orchestration was also lovely, but in general, it's pretty much the standard fare you would find on most other celebrity Christmas albums.

{"text":"In anticipation of going to see Heart again in concert not long ago (more on that later), I decided to check out \"Fanatic\", which was released last Fall, but I had not listened to it until now.\n\n\"Fanatic\" (10 tracks; 39 min.) starts with the title track, a heavy duty rocker that is vintage 70s Heart, what a way to start off the album! \"Dear Old America\" is another rocker. Things slow down with \"Walkin' Good\", with background vocals from Sarah McLachlan. \"Skin & Bones\" is biting little blues-rocker (written on the tour bus driving from LA to Cincinnati, according to enjoyable liner notes from Ann and Nancy). \"Mashallah!\" is another high energy tune. The last highlight for me on this album is \"59 Crunch\", and the song title says it all. Heavy cruncher rock tune. Love it! This is the best album from Heart in a long, long time!\n\nLast month, I saw Heart in concert at Riverbend here in Cincinnati on their summer tour with Jason Bonham's Led Zeppelin Experience opening. What a terrific evening of music that was! Not to mention there was a massive crowd for this. Ann and Nancy were on fire, with tons of energy. I was quite surprised that they played only 1 song from the new album (\"Dear Old America\"), but it matters little. What is clear is that Ann and Nancy, now in their late 50s\/early 60s, continue to rock, and rock hard at that. Meanwhile, \"Fanatic\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 2\" is the second of three chamber music Big Box MP3 albums from The Bach Guild. It contains chamber music works from various composers of the romantic period of classical music, including (among others): Ernst von Dohn&aacute;nyi, Claude Debussy, Darius Milhaud, Alban Berg, Maurice Ravel, and Charles Gounod.\n\nAlthough I am somewhat less familiar with these composers chamber works than I am with those of J.S. Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, I am very impressed with the selections that appear on this album. I think my favorites are Milhauds Petite Symphony No. 3 as performed by the Sinfonia Orchestra with Barry Faldner, and Dohn&aacute;nyis Piano Quintet No. 1 in C minor by The Cleveland Quartet with Barry Snyder. I also find the Debussys Sonata for Flute, Viola, and Harp to be especially enjoyable.\n\nAs is the case with every Big Box MP3 album I have purchased thus far, the audio quality of Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 2 is excellent.

{"text":"Ori And The Blind Forest is a new platforming game that beautifully encompasses the player in a fantasy world wrapped around an emotional story. The visuals and gameplay are stunning and if you find yourself being whisked away to some fantasy world by the music, you should see it paired with the gameplay. Games like this are supremely focused on gameplay, as it becomes an integral part of the structure. Gareth Coker was tasked at building an immense score to not only bring the worlds of the blind forest to life, but bring emotional resonance to the story and characters. He succeeds greatly with a score that's wondrous, magical, beautiful, exciting and full of life.\n\nOri And The Blind Forest opens with the central theme as the story begins. The storys protagonist is a forest spirit whose life begins with a great tragedy, this propels him to find his purpose within the world that surrounds him. Coker does a wonderful job gently delivering some heavy emotions right from the get go. This gives our narrative an emotional weight to build from as Oris extensive journey lays ahead. Speaking of Journey, many may feel compelled to compare both the game and the score to Journey. Journey is a masterpiece, I will say that, of both score and game. However, what we have here is a 9-hour platformer that immerses us in a lush and complex world. Journey was a 2.5 hour game that embraced more of a simple and streamlined approach to emotions and gameplay. Both are wonderful in their own rights. The score here in its entirety is the embodiment of a beautiful fairytale adventure, of a personal journey of discovery. The music does its duties to make each different area feel unique while still keeping the central core of the character at the forefront. So instead of musical ideas such as Level 1 theme\/Level 2 theme, we have Ori in Level 1\/Ori in Level 2. It makes the score that much more accessible and a better storytelling tool than traditional platforming scores. With that being said, there may some disconnect and its hard to keep the grand picture in scope through the journey at times. The score has to sustain a long journey through various different levels, and its inevitable that some pacing issues in the narrative would have to make way for the gameplay. However, its a minuscule structural thing that doesn't really take away from the grand awe of the score by the time we reach its emotional end. Once the score sets into the final act, the listener will be filled with rushes of emotions as Coker brings everything full circle in a truly breathtaking fashion.\n\nOri And The Blind Forest is a tremendous effort from Gareth Coker. He managed to build a beautiful story through a strong central theme that traverses a rich and living world. Oris journey becomes our journey, and the music brings everything to life in the game. There is no dialogue, just sporadic narration in a fictional language. So the music here carries everything. While some slight structural clunkiness occurs, its not enough to stop the power of this score. The music will wash over you and sweep you away on one of the more memorable journeys you will take. Dont skip over Ori And The Blind Forest; its something that will touch gamers and non-gamers alike.","classification":5,"fold":4}

Her latest single \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Roar\/dp\/B00EH49FRE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Roar<\/a>\", from the pop singer's upcoming effort Prism, is by no means horrid, but it also doesn't latch like her best singles do.  It's catchy enough, but it doesn't supersede the ubiquitous \"Firework\".\n\nHonestly, there are some positive attributes, including that more attention seems to be spent on making Perry's voice itself 'roar' more than some of her records.  Calling Perry a top-rate pop vocalist would be a stretch, but Perry does what she needs to do vocally to make her music appealing. That said, \"Roar\" suffers more than anything else because it feels like nothing 'new'  in a sense.  There is no collaborator to accentuate Perry or provide more oomph or break from the monotony (Snoop Dogg added some spice to \"California Gurls\" for example).  Additionally, while the uplifting nature and concept of the song is a nice idea, this has been done and redone numerous times.  Being inspiring and wise is by no means schmaltzy or unappreciated, but even Sara Bareilles did this on recent effort&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Blessed-Unrest\/dp\/B00CF7PG5U\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Blessed Unrest<\/a>&nbsp;(\"Brave\", \"Hercules\").\n\nUltimately, \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Roar\/dp\/B00EH49FRE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Roar<\/a>\" will still likely give Perry success on the Billboard Hot 100.

Add to that the music, and you've got the complete package with this song. Buy it for a date, or to tell that special someone how they feel.

{"text":"I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play \"Amarillo By Morning,\" and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to \"Amarillo by Morning.\"\n\nSo, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy\/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered.","classification":5,"fold":4}
{"text":"I can't wait to use this track to introduce freedom week to my students  I saw this on facebook and it literally grabs your heartguts and shakes them like a ragdoll.  I have to say in 35 years patriotism, patriotic were just words to me. I am grateful to live in America but my heart has never swelled with Patriotic pride, it is hard to explain American is something I am, not something I feel. Then I heard this and some very unfamiliar feelings in my heartguts swelled up. It's like when the eagles rescue Sam and Frodo off the mountain, when Denna the Mordsith sacrifices her life for Richard Rahl when Nicci saw the statue and the feeling I got as the reader. When Commander Shepard steps out of the rubble of Soveriegn, vows not to let fear compromise who she is as she blows the collectors back to hell and then gives her final speech when she refuses to beome a collaborater in a war crime before we learn this was the end of all she knew. I laughed with a feeling akin to joy and I think this is what being patriotic feels like.

{"text":"Judd Apatow's movies all have one thing in common, aside from the comedy: they're earnest and sentimental.  The music that Apatow has gotten from THIS IS 40 (like with his previous FUNNY PEOPLE) is a mix of mostly warm, older artists' rock-n-roll.  Aside from the opening \"Yes, I'm Your Angel\" by Yoko Ono, most of these songs are without whimsy or much potential for comedy.  For someone just interested in this, that's great: you don't have to put up with some of the silly musical asides that many comedies have.  Instead, the THIS IS 40 soundtrack is a pretty good compilation that doesn't require listeners to have watched the movie to get the most of it.\n\nThis soundtrack is built from mostly older artists, with the exception of a few tracks (Fiona Apple, Norah Jones, Wilco, Ryan Adams).  Accordingly, this compilation will probably appeal more to older fans out there, much like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/FUNNY-PEOPLE-soundtrack\/dp\/B002I519GY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">FUNNY PEOPLE soundtrack<\/a>.  Graham Parker has two songs on this collection, not surprising due to his involvement in the movie's plot, and they are both pretty outstanding.  His collaboration with the (always good) Punch Brothers, \"What Do You Like?\", is worth checking out.  The mostly volatile of these songs is Fiona Apple's \"Dull Tool,\" and with the exception of this song, this set of songs will probably put you in a good mood.\n\nIf you're looking for a mellow, rock-based album, THIS IS 40 is a pretty good mix of great songs.  Plenty of great artists included on this, and perhaps not surprisingly, it works great on its own as a standalone entity.  Album highlights: \"Live and Die\" by the Avett Brothers; \"Sick of You\" by Lindsey Buckingham; \"What Do You Like?\" by Graham Parker and Punch Brothers.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"R2F were formed in 1972 with 2 core members represented here in Chick Corea (piano & keyboards) and Stanley Clarke (electric and acoustic bass). Drummer Lenny White joined the band in 1973. Throughout the following years the lineup changed with Corea and Clarke always in place. Each did their own thing as well. White left in 1977 but returned for good in 1983. Guitarist Frank Gambale and violinist Jean-Luc Ponte joined the group in 2010.\n\nEarly on their version of fusion-jazz appealed to many fans including this one. Hell, I still have a couple 8-Track recordings in a drawer. Ponte's addition is a good move. His jazz fiddle shares the lead on several long pieces on this excellent 2 disc live session. The 2 discs contain 9 tracks with an average length of 12 1\/2 minutes giving proper showcasing of each member of the quintet. I was especially impressed by Stanley Jordon's work on the stand-up bass. Gambale is an excellent guitarist and works well with Corea in sharing the lead. White keeps everyone on time and adds a piece to the song collection.\n\nThis package includes a 3rd disc which is a DVD in Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. Included on the DVD is a 64 minute documentary featuring the group speaking about each of the songs selected for the album. It also has an 8+ minute sneak peak at a movie trailer called \"The \"Story of Return to Forever.\" It includes 2 slightly blurry video performances (\"After the Cosmic Rain\" and \"The Romantic Warrior\") performed in full in front of an appreciative live audience. Fans of the band and those who are unfamiliar should check out one of the most influential groups in musical history. They still have it.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Bless Kevin Starrs' (aka Uncle Acid) hippy dippy heart.  His love for all things psychedelic is so deep he insists on recording in a real analog studio (that means the old tape machine, for you digital generation listeners) and does accomplish that older dusty sound.  Whether that feat is good or bad is a matter of taste.  But it's interesting because vinyl is making a big comeback, after naysayers predicted a total death of albums and CD's in the download era, and neither seem to be going away because some fans want artwork, such as myself, and audiophiles all know CD's are still the unquestioned best sound quality of any medium.  I personally refuse to download music and I never will.  I have no interest in MP3 players.\n  So here we are with \"The Night Creeper\", a concept album about a murderous stalker.  The album as always is full of big fuzzy riffs, Starrs' weird helium balloon sounding voice, and a vibe that is a nod back to the uglier part of the '60's.  We like to remember all the Woodstock ideology, but turmoil in the form of Charles Manson and assassinations, the war in Vietnam and violent protests and riots were as indelible as a naked hippy in the mud grooving to Hendrix.  This is the part that Uncle Acid remembers.\n  But even though it's a dark topic, there is enough groove to rock to, and some genuine musicianship that makes UA a damn good band.  Where the previous album \"Mind Control\" had more mesmerizing moments, \"The Night Creeper\" rocks a bit more, and fits in nicely with the stoner crowd.  Several current bands out there are focusing on real songwriting and maybe unfairly being accused of being retro '70's, but that was the last decade where heavy music was allowed to have its melodic moments.  Uncle Acid, Ghost, Orange Goblin, Muse, Opeth and others all are bringing back real hooks and hopefully this trend will bleed over into heavier territory if only to give some competition to metalcore crap like Asking Alexandria, Acacia Strain and other talentless screaming fakes.  \"The Night Creeper\" will please fans of old Sabbath, too.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Although I only bought BE MY BABY: THE VERY BEST OF THE RONETTES CD as an afterthought while buying the re-issues of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Sound-of-Love-The-Very-Best-of-Darlene-Love\/dp\/B003102JKA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Sound of Love: The Very Best of Darlene Love<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Da-Doo-Ron-Ron-The-Very-Best-of-The-Crystals\/dp\/B004GHBQRE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Da Doo Ron Ron: The Very Best of The Crystals<\/a>&nbsp;for Darlene Love, I have to say that this CD has really grown on me.\n\nI was only familiar with the song \"Be My Baby,\" so I'm by no means a Ronettes expert or die hard fan, but their unique sound consisting of lead singer Veronica (Ronnie) Bennett (soon-to-be Spector), her sister Estelle and their cousin Nedra Talley singing backup, has won me over. That Ronette sound is so different than say the Supremes that you can't help but take notice.\n\nSome of the lyrics are very teenage-oriented with phrases like \"too young to go steady\" and \"too young, can't marry no one\" -- of course the Ronettes were just teenagers themselves when they recorded these songs -- but that doesn't interfere with listening pleasure. There's an edge to Ronnie Spector's voice that belies the youthful sound and innocent lyrics, so you don't get bubble-gum pop overload.\n\nThe songs collected here were recorded from 1963-1969 and I can't find a weak one in the bunch. Even though they were recorded at different times and have different themes like longing for love, being in love, and then breaking up, and appeared on different albums, the entire CD has consistency so none of the tracks seem out of place.\n\nA CD booklet is included and contains color and black & white pictures, liner notes by Lenny Kaye written in 2007, and information on each track (chart position, record date, album title, etc.).\n\nEach song has been remastered and sounds great! I have to admit that it took me a little while to get used to the Phil Spector \"Wall Of Sound\" technique of recording because at first it sounds like each track was recorded in a cavern with lots of spatial echoing and sounds muffled. But on repeated listening, I've discovered that the echo is more on the music and the vocals are centered and quite clear. The music sort of envelops the vocals, more so than the Motown sound, and so I guess it takes a while for the brain to recognize that there is separation.\n\nAgain I've have no experience with the vinyl or other editions of the Ronettes releases with the exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Phil-Spector-Collection\/dp\/B000K2Q8DQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Phil Spector Collection<\/a>, so I can't really say if the sound on this CD is at its best, I know that one reviewer doesn't seem to think so, but it sounds OK to me.\n\nAnyway, I highly recommend picking up the Ronettes' BE MY BABY: THE VERY BEST OF THE RONETTES if you like 60s music. And check out their performances on youtube.","classification":5,"fold":4}

But this album is amazing! It not only puts Manson back but rock music back as well. It's been a very long time since rock music had anything really dark, heavy and accessibly good for some time. The production is great, the guitars really come out which is a rarity these days. The blues inspired metal sound on this album is really what makes this album. Mansons voice and energy is still there. There is change on this album, but in a very good way. It's aggressive, dark, moody, comical all at the same time. I wish I got the deluxe edition. I didn't know what to expect when I bought this album but I'm glad I did. A lot of critics said that Manson really matured on this album, I really don't know what they mean, all the crazy lyrics are still there just like any Manson album. All the references to drugs, destruction, madness are still there. Maybe everyone has become so desensitized to it that it becomes mature, who knows? All the critics still say this is a great album which is agreeable. Manson is truly an artist beneath all the things Manson is wrongly labeled for.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Chrissie Hynde is a rock goddess. I think if I saw her in a bar, I'd saunter up to her, too. Which is what happened to JP Jones, a singer of unknown repute until this CD. Seems he and Chrissie had a fling and, once it became apparent that their near 30 year age difference wasn't going to work, they broke it off. But they also decided to make an album about it.\n\nAnd that album is \"Fidelity.\" It is, believe it or not, the first album Chrissie Hynde has ever released that wasn't under The Pretenders banner. I hate to say this, but it's pretty awful. The soulful, husky voice of Chrissie remains a universal wonder, and when she sings, she still sounds great. JP, on the other hand, has a range of about five notes, and has a problem hitting most of them. When Chrissie opens \"Fidelity\" with the lament that \"I found my perfect lover, but he's only half my age,\" you can feel that she's still got it as she nears 60. That talent is even more emphasized as soon as JP opens is mouth. He begins interjecting observations into \"Perfect Lover\" that sound like some joker prank calling the studio and getting caught on-mike.\n\nWhich pretty much sums up this album. There are some pretty good songs here just aching to get out (\"Your Fairground,\" \"Courage,\" \"Misty Valleys\"), but they crash to the dirt every time JP's carny barker donkey-bray hits the speakers. Next to Rufus Wainwright's \"All Days are Nights\/Songs for Lulu,\" this album is one of the year's biggest disappointments. Mark JP Jones in your trivia book now.","classification":2,"fold":4}

It's simple, but its synth beats and \"yodeling\" chorus is instantly recognizable to anyone who was mentally cognizant at the time (it was in a Listerine commercial and an ad for one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies, notably). The composition really feels fun and yet heroic at the same time, making you think that it's deeper than it is. It's a shame that Baltimora died before he ever topped it, and even more of a shame that there are no really good covers of this song to carry on the legacy, but that's neither here nor there: If you want something a little cheesy and a lot of fun to dance to, pick up Tarzan Boy!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Prince returns with Phase 2 of his HITnRUN series of albums and delivers an absolutely awesome collection of songs featuring The NPG in fine form. Produced by Prince and The New Power generation, Phase 2 features killer musical performances by Ida Nielsen on bass, John Blackwell on drums, Cassandra O'Neal on keys, Andrew Gouche on bass, along with vocals by Shelby J, Liv Warfield, Elisa Dease, and Andy Allo. The songs are mainly funk grooves along with a couple of signature breezy pop tunes. The  NPG Hornz are in full flight throughout this funky onslaught and they really beef up this organic sound in a way that hasn't been done by prince in a few years. The entire album is brilliant but some highlights include the groovy rerecorded version of \"Rocknroll Loveaffair\", the funktastic sounds of \"Xtraloveable\", the amazing musicianship of \"Groovy Potential\", the gorgeous ballad \"When She Comes\", the wicked beats of \"Black Muse\", the purple masterpiece \"Revelation\", and the fun closing track \"Big City\". Prince really has delivered a very strong and very satisfying album for his fans here with old songs and new songs standing side by side in a cohesive collection. Although the physical album is hard to get at present with only a few retailers stocking it, I was able to get a copy at the recent Australian Piano and Microphone shows that made purple history this week. A wider retail release is due in the next few weeks and I highly recommend all Prince fans to hop on the HITnRUN musical bandwagon. HITnRUN Phase 2 is easily one of Prince's best albums and shows that his musical legacy still continues to grow at full speed, as if you ever questioned it anyway.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Odessa was the Bee Gees' fourth internationally released album, and their first double album. It was by far their most ambitious release and was had a red-flocked cover and included a poster and sticker. At a certain point the title \"Masterpeace\" was considered.\n\nThe band was still a 5-piece band at the beginning of the recordings, but before the release of the album in 1969, guitarist Vince Melouney had left the group.\n\nThough not a direct concept album there are themes about the ship Odessa that runs though the songs. Apart from some long, mostly instrumental orchestral pieces, the music is not really that different from the group's previous releases.\n\nTo be regarded as a real classic I find the album too uneven, with too many average songs. There are of course a lot songs, too, that ranks with the very best of their early works.  I have always liked their music best without the big arrangements that often burdened good songs too much.\n\nSimple songs with great melodies like, \"Sudddenly\", \"You'll Never See My Face Again\" and \"I Laugh in Your Face\" are still my favourites. I also used to like \"Marley Purt Drive\", but it seems the songs hasn't aged that well.\n\nAmong the classic ballads \"Lamplight\" is outstanding, and \"Melody Fair\" and \"First of May\" are both great songs.\n\nThis 3 CD version contains both mono and stereo versions of the original album, and the third CD contains some very interesting alternate versions along with some previously unreleased songs. Many of these are almost as good as the well-known versions, and a few maybe even better; I especially like the alternate mix of \"You'll Never See My Face Again\". The song \"Barbara Came to Stay\", is the same tune as \"Edison\", with different lyrics, and also one of the great additions. For fans of the group, this deluxe edition of one of their highly praised albums, of course is must.\n\nGreat reproduction of the original cover and a fine informative booklet too.","classification":5,"fold":4}

Or if an artist doesn't  have a diverse discography, it may a pathway to get another album released.\nThen there are artists that have reached a certain degree of popularity. Oftimes, there Christmas albums become perennial favorites like The Temperature, Johnny Mathis, The Supremes, Barbara Streisand and Mariah Carey. All the above listed artist' Christmas albums sell season after season. Luther Vandross ably joins this elite group.\nSome of these artists perfect the genre and get to release several holiday albums over the length of their career. That includes The Temptations (3), Mariah Carey (2), Diana Ross (4), Natalie Cole (3), Barbara Streisand (2), etc. Luther now must be added to that list.\nSeveral of these artists benefit with a popular television special like Diana Ross, Natalie Cole, Elvis Presley and also Mr. Vandross.\nLuther's voice was perfect for Christmas as it is warm and he convincingly conveys his obvious love for the season.\nHe puts his stamp on classics like \"The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)\" and \"Have Yourself a Merry Christmas\". He also adds several new originals that one or more could become modern day classics.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Owl City has become one of my favorite bands (even if it is only one guy on a synthesizer), and when I heard he was performing a song for the soundtrack of \"Wreck-It Ralph,\" I was excited beyond belief.  Owl City's music is upbeat and fun, and its electronic sound would be a perfect match for a movie about video games.  And while I have not yet seen the movie, the song did not disappoint, and I am convinced that Owl City was the perfect choice for this soundtrack.  \"When Can I See You Again?\" is an upbeat and cheerful song that never fails to lift my spirits.\n\nI am a little disappointed that it looks like Disney didn't include more of Owl City's songs on its soundtrack.  I wouldn't mind a return to full-on musicals from Disney if it meant this band could create more numbers for the movie.  It's that fun.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I reviewed the green-version CD when it came out.  I'm saddened beyond words at the untimely loss of Peter Steele just last week.  I'm convinced he had a lot of great music ahead of him.  That said, it's my opinion that he went out absolutely on top with \"Dead Again\".  When this disc came out, I listened to it nearly continuously for two years--no lie.  I've never had such a strong reaction to any Type O Negative CD, not even \"Bloody Kisses\" and \"October Rust\", my two other favorites.  While there may be some Type O fans who might disagree with me, \"Dead Again\" is so phenomenal that it's practically beyond criticism.  The \"highs\" have never been higher, and the overall level of quality is tremendous, with the exception of \"She Burned Me Down\" which seems to go on a bit pointlessly.  Standout tracks include \"Dead Again,\" \"Tripping A Blind Man,\" \"Profits of Doom,\" \"September Sun,\" \"These Three Things,\" \"An Ode To Locksmiths,\" and \"All Hail And Farewell To Britain.\"\n\nI could be barking up the wrong tree, but I've long thought that Peter Steele has to have had significant exposure to classical music.  This isn't a new opinion for me, but his development as a songwriter suggests to me he was drawing on an awareness of symphonic masters.  Two tracks in particular bear this out.\n\n\"September Sun\" is an astonishing song that became something of an obsession.  The very first time I heard track four, I literally groaned and said to myself, \"they can't be serious!\"  \"September Sun\" starts like a \"hair band\" power ballad, with a simple nice piano intro--totally not Type O. And then it occurred to me, knowing that this is Peter Steele, this has to be a joke and it's going to get turned inside out and trashed. And actually something very different happens.  Steele does something profoundly Brucknerian with \"September Sun\"--he takes a very simple basic theme, expands upon it, puts it through a metamorphosis, and it ends up becoming something far more imposing, grander, astonishing, and even menacing, than you can have even been lead to believe it would become, by the time the song is over nearly 10 minutes later, and really takes you somewhere. \"September Sun\" has to be heard in its astonishing entirety, and for me it is an especially imposing, threatening, beautiful, and entirely unnerving piece of music. It haunts me while still blowing me away.\n\n\"These Three Things\" is also a musical standout (I usually don't pay attention to the words, and listening to Peter Steele rant against abortion is more humorous than anything else--and it was not intended as a joke).  At just under 15 minutes, it's the longest song that Type O ever recorded.  And unlike some of their lengthier songs which are really just a collection of several smaller songs strung together, \"These Three Things\" takes musical ideas and works them out over the length of the song, transforming them by the end.  Beyond the drone introduction, the initial section of the song is musically one of the most brutal things that Type O has ever done--relentless, overpowering, and raw.  And then the music takes a 180, introduces a new musical theme, and then transforms it over the remainder of the song.  I wasn't overwhelmed by \"These Three Things\" initially, but almost more than any other song on this CD, it grew on me to the point of becoming one of the very highlights.\n\nI've long had the opinion that \"Dead Again\" is Type O Negative's finest work--which is not to diminish \"Bloody Kisses\" or \"October Rust\" in any way, as great as they are.  In \"Dead Again,\" Type O pushed themselves hard, not settling to re-do what they have already done, and I think they made real breakthroughs and succeeded on every level.\n\nTo Peter Steele, let me say this:  THANK YOU, Peter, for giving us such outstanding music.  Words will never express how grateful I am.  I also feel very fortunate to have seen Type O play live numerous times.  You didn't do it by yourself, Type O clearly was a band, not a man with three backup players, but you were the creative force, the vision, and the voice.  I will be listening to your music likely for the rest of my life, and I have no doubt it will stand the test of time.  Many musicians have made a name for themselves, but few have had the capacity for such an original vision, and the talent to achieve it.  You did, and I thank you for that from the bottom of my heart.  At the end of several of a number of Type O's concerts, you would say right before leaving, while grasping your heart, \"Thank you, for without you, we are nothing,\" and it never came across as anything but heartfelt.  Hearing more about you after your passing, about your truly humble nature, I am more sure than ever that those words were your truth.  But my truth is, it was not you in our debt, but the other way around.  We are lucky to have had you sharing your gift with us.  Thank you, Peter.  If there is an \"other side\" (and I have a hard time believing there is), I hope you had a good journey and are at peace.  You deserve it.  Peace, Green Man.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Nirvana's 1991 album Nevermind is still one of the '90s best albums to me. It just jumped right out of left field. I didn't hear it until 1992, but I was just blown away by the riffs and well recorded songs.  There's a rawness to this album that doesn't let go!  Smells Like Teen Spirit is still fresh 15 years later, as well as Lithium, Polly, the more poppish Come as You Are, On A Plane and others. One of two surprises that also stand out is Territorial, which zooms so fast at 115 mph in its sound and how they slow the speed down dramatically as if a record player is turned off. Kurt Cobain's screaming like crazy after the first minute. It sounds as if you're hearing the guitars mashed right up very close to the amplifiers, all the screeches and the like!  It makes for a great song without the typical formulaic verse\/chorus\/verse songs we're used to hearing.  Another surprise is the quiet ballad, Something in the Way and its acoustic feel. Melodic and well written. I never thought that Nirvana would pull it off on that song--I thought they were mostly loud all the time, but this is one of their best songs from their catalog. The album's Kurt Cobain all throughout, but Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic were superb on the lead guitars and drums that dominate this effort. It has really had an impact on Dave's current success with the Foo Fighters.  The songwriting from Cobain was different, but top notch. After Nevermind, nearly every alternative band except Pearl Jam was copying its sounds and textures.  Some succeeded and some failed. This album helped make alternative music dominate 6 years of the '90s, yet it balanced well with the R&B ballads, rap, dance and pop artists that dominated the decade. Although Cobain is no longer with us, this album keeps his and his band's spirit completely alive. Ten to 20 years from now, they're still going to be talking about this album. Kurt didn't expect the multi-platinum success it got, but people still love it, still buy it and are still playing it. It is one of the 20th century's best albums, artistic, aggressive and chance taking.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Believe it or not, this was my first time purchasing a Trina album. It's not that I haven't liked any of her songs in the past, because I have. I guess she was just never one of my top priority artists. I immediately took notice of her, though, with her 2000 (or maybe 1999) debut single, \"Da Baddest Chick.\" I actually liked the song initially--although it sounds a bit dated today--and the video, which showed her smashing all kinds of things with a baseball bat, was pretty amusing, too. The next single was the summer-anthem, \"Pull Over,\" which had my head bobbing for quite awhile. I pretty much enjoyed most of her singles, including \"Told Y'All,\" the song she did with Tweet and Missy Elliott, and of course \"Single Again.\" I've thought about buying her past three albums when each came out, but I became uneasy about them after listening to samples. They just didn't affect me the way her singles did and the production sounded a bit sub-par. However, the samples for this album sounded much better, and with her initial success with this album--debuting at her highest Billboard chart position ever--I decided to finally give one of Trina's album a try.\n\nThe album opens with a terribly stupid and useless intro, which is just here to take up an extra minute. The smarter choice would've been to just begin the album with the first full-length track, \"Still Da Baddest.\" The superb production is upbeat and dramatically triumphant, a perfect canvas for Trina's confident and boastful lines about her survival and success in the music business. (Believe it or not, this female emcee has been in the rap game for one or two years shy of a decade). The first single, \"Single Again,\" is also one of the best tracks from this set; it has a catchy chorus and is a bonafide ladies' anthem. I really can't understand why the song wasn't very successful. \"Look Back At Me\" should definitely be a future single, with its simplistic, dirty South production mixed with chopped and screwed vocals. \"I Got A Bottle,\" which features a guest appearance from Missy Elliott, is a fun and playful club song. On \"Clear It Out,\" Trina gives us a piece of her mind, stating how she is fed up with haters, critics, and aspiring female rappers who think the life is easy. And \"Hot Commodity\" is a great closing track; it's just as upbeat and proud as the opening song. Unfortunately, those were the only tracks that I was really pleased with. The rest are pretty unexciting. \"I Got A Thang For You\" and \"Wish I Never Met You\" both desparately try to replicate her most successful single to date, \"Here We Go Again.\" (Which I didn't think was that great in the first place). The production isn't great, and Trina's rhymes are way too laid-back and lazy. \"Killing You...\" is bland and very repetitve and \"Phone\" is simply here for shock value, nothing more. Last, \"Stop Traffic\" suffers from subpar production and a really lame hook. (Yeah, yeah, yeah... I know green means \"go\" and red means \"stop.\" That's not clever!)\n\nThe bottom line: So... I've finally bought a Trina album. While it's a bit better than I was expectting, Still Da Baddest is far from flawless. It has several excellent tracks that I thoroughly enjoyed, but there is no medium on here. It's either really good, or really bad, and there are just as many bad songs as there are good. Most of the time Trina's rhymes are okay and even sometimes great (except for the somewhat pitiful deliveries on the two ballads). What really causes this album to suffer is the lack of quality in production, hooks, or song ideas. If you're a Trina fan, buy it. If not, I wouldn't really recommend it. Sure there are some good tracks here, but they are barely worth it for me.\n\nKey tracks: Single Again, Look Back At Me, Still Da Baddest, Hot Commodity.","classification":2,"fold":4}

This album is so wonderful, Cher's voice soars like nothing else she has done before.  Check out the amazing \"When The Money's Gone\", it is so perfect that you'll have to listen to it over and over again until your are dead tired.  Clear the dance floor!  \"Different Kind Of Song\" blasts through your speaker with super sonic vocoder energy.  The hook is unreal, and \"Alive Again\" is a spiritual moment unlike anyother.  The US includes the tracks \"When You Walk Away\" and let me tell you-so good.  Much more upbeat then \"You Take It All\"(on the international pressing), and fits itself nicely into the overall atmosphere of the album.  I believe that this is Cher's most thought provoking and fully put together album.  There is a heavy spiritual vibe that runs through the ablum, take \"Love One Another\" for example.  And obviously the afore mentioned \"Song For The Lonely\" is included.  \"The Music's No Good Without You\" is one of my favorite Cher songs ever.  Talk about fabulous.

{"text":"Usually, I don't listen to Country music, but I made the exception when I saw these guys on the Grammy's.  They are fantastic and I not only love Jennifer Nettles voice, but the music is so catchy and fun and great.\n\nFly Away, Something More, Just Might (Make Me Believe) and Stand Back Up are my favourites, but then they are all good songs and I'm surprised about how much I love this since I'm really mainly into R&B and Hip Hop.  These guys are talented and write such great songs.  They also performed on Las Vegas and look like they are having fun on stage.  They sound fresh and I have really taken to this group and this cd.  I hope they keep releasing music like this.  They might just convert me yet.  I love it.  Even if you aren't a Country fan, you too might surprise yourself.

After listening to the samples songs Amazon provided it sounded like this new album by Adelitas Way was worth buying. Let me tell you that I was very pleased after listening to this album in full. I'd say I've listed to every track three times now and each and every song is just great! The first single released, \"Sick\", is just amazing and I love \"Cage the Beast\". It's so great to finally get a follow up album to a band's debut release that doesn't stink. So many bands these days come out strong initially and then they just don't put out quality music after that, or they do something different on a follow up album that made them successful on their first. Definately pick up this release by Adelitas Way, it's well worth it!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I love this song, and amazon makes it totally worth it because unlike stupid iTunes, you can keep downloading it to a new phone, or redownload it if your internet dies or something in the middle of the download, all for free.\nSee iTunes, if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load, or your power goes out, or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again, trust me, I experienced that huge problem with iTunes MORE THAN ONCE.\nWhere as Amazon is awesome cause it's all on your account, so you just log in and it's there, and it shows that you paid the $1 for it so it's yours. Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you paid for it, its all legal , and it's yours, for like EVER. :D And (like I said above) if you loose internet connection you can retry the download unlike iTunes :D\nIn my own PERSONAL opinion I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND you download songs, and buy songs from Amazon.com verses buying it on iTunes. c:","classification":5,"fold":4}

Janis had the insight to write this song at age 13!  I would give this song 5 stars except that the girl cops out at the end. However, the song played in 1965 or 1967, so the taboo of the times still has to be considered.

{"text":"Tempted to say that this is THE best soundtrack of all the Halo games. I love the soundtrack for Halo 3 and it was my hands down favorite up until now but for some reason, this one actually makes me feel something. It's very somber and fits the mood of the game very well. It reminds me at times of Blade Runner mixed with the now familiar cues and themes of the Halo series. I find the game to have a feel reminiscent of old film noir movies and there are pieces that punctuate this very well, using piano and saxophone to nail down that \"walking down that street by yourself in the rain\" feeling, which the Rookie portions of the game itself feel like.\n\nIf you are a fan of soundtracks, whether they be from a game, film, tv show or whatever, this is a solid purchase. Part of what has made Halo (a BIG part in fact) such a success over the years is the music by the team of O'Donnell and Salvatori. The music is pretty much a character in the game as much as anything else and the soundtrack for Halo 3: ODST is quite possibly the best of them all. It stands on its own two feet and is an enjoyable listen on all fronts.\n\nI'd also like to commend Sumthing Else for putting out another stellar release this year. This and their three-disc release of Resident Evil 5 are must have purchases for anyone who enjoys this stuff as much as I do.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Patsy set the standard for female country singers, with many of those that followed trying (or so it seemed) to be the next Patsy Cline - even today, over forty years after her death in a plane crash. Many compilations are available but most of them seem to miss something important. Not this one - all of Patsy's classic songs can be found here.\n\nCrazy was a top ten pop hit in America and (in 1990) a top twenty hit in Britain. Heartaches was Patsy's first American top forty pop hit. Don Gibson wrote Sweet dreams and had a big country hit with it, but once Patsy recorded it, it became much more popular and will be forever thought of as a Patsy Cline song. She's got you was an American top twenty pop hit and was also Patsy's first British hit, albeit only a minor one I fall to pieces was yet another top twenty pop hit in America. Walking after midnight is the song that began it all for Patsy in the fifties. Poor man's roses, Back in baby's arms and Leaving on your mind are other Patsy classics included here. Faded love, a cover of a Bob Wills song that, like Sweet dreams, is regarded as a Patsy Cline classic despite being a cover.\n\nAlso here are Patsy's fine interpretations of Lovesick blues, Half as much (Hank Williams), True Love (Bing Crosby), San Antonio rose (Bob Wills), Always (written by Irving Berlin) and many other fine songs.\n\nIf you just want one CD of Patsy's music, make it this one.","classification":5,"fold":4}

This is definitely worthy of the hype and the glowing reviews and the legendary status its received over the years. Few albums that I've heard have so successfully merged rock with blues and jazz, and throw in some soul and country and few psychedelic flourishes while you're at it.

It's entirely a matter of opinion, and a review of a song is basically pointless.  I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.\n\nBut youtube exists now.  It's not like you need to base your purchase on what other people think.  You listen to the song, and if you like it enough to want it on your mp3 player (or in better quality than youtube)... (or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.\n\nI guess I'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review... Seriously though, I love the fact that amazon hosts customer reviews, but it's a bit unnecessary for individual songs.","classification":5,"fold":4}

The beats and rhythm in the song sound like a merry-go-round would sound if music went with it.  \"Merry-go-round,\"  \"Around\" the way..\"  anyway, he is rhyming about making passes at girls while walking down the block, most likely in Jamaica, Queens where he grew up.

She has had the substance and especially the style to match in each of her records. Not overdone or boring, but just right in music. But when I heard this song, I was a bit surprised in the song. Girl On Fire, the title track from Alicia Keys' 6th album is not actually one of her better songs. It isn't a bad song, but doesn't seem to drive as much as her earlier songs from The Element Of Freedom a few years ago. It is definitely classic with Alicia's earlier songs like No One had shown, but honestly more could have been done to make it driven.

Vox recordings from that era were typically a bit tinny, probably because they thought nothing of putting 30 minutes of music on one side of an LP.  Most of these recordings are better than that, but some are lacking.  The performances are a bit more schmaltzy and slower in tempo than the more recent recordings of Rachmaninoff I've heard.  The Symphonic Dances are my favorite among these recordings.  Pretty good, but there are other recordings of S R's work that I prefer.  A good value for the price which is what Vox tends to sell.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"It is hard to imagine enigma's from so many artists. Whether they are just pure genius, or mad as a hatter. What the music brings s actually what really should count. For Michael Jackson, he is one that has been tormented bith ways. Arguably, after his child molestation trial vindication, many wonder if he will ever be heard from again. Arguably, that will be a test from time. Nevertheless, what he has accomplished as a innovator keeps on showing in his music and his videos. Although there have been adequate collections that need improvement, there hasn't been anything loosely definitive, until now.\n\nThe Essential Michael Jackson, a collection reflection his career in three folds: Jackson 5, Jacksons, and on his own, is a double album reflecting his well-received career. The songs here have really been remastered very well and still withstand that test of Michaels' Moonwalking mayhem. The collection includes most of his biggest hits including Beat It, Wanna Be Staring Something, ABC, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Black Or White, and You Walk My World. The compilation does show quite a lot, but like most collections, there are just a few glitches to the parade. The album overshadows a few of Michael's big tracks including Scream with Janet Jackson, Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, One More Chance, his last song from his Number Ones collection, and others die hard Jacko maniacs would want.\n\nAll in all, Michael Jackson was strange, but one of a kind. Yet, his music will keep everyybody rocking with him for a very long time. Hopefully, he should try to do it again soon. What ever reflection, The Essential Michael Jackson is one of the very few definitive hits collections for 2005.\n\nAlbum Cover: B+\n\nMastering: A-\n\nSongs: B 1\/2+\n\nPrice: B\n\nOverall: B 1\/2+","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Sufjan Stevens had been gone `too long' from the indie-rock circuit when 2010's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/All-Delighted-People-EP\/dp\/B00406525S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">All Delighted People EP<\/a>&nbsp;materialized on August 23, 2010.  His last full length was the critically acclaimed (and a personal favorite) 2005 album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Illinois\/dp\/B0009R1T7M\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Illinois<\/a>.  Only months following his recent EP,  Stevens drops the true follow-up to his 2005 effort, entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Age-of-Adz\/dp\/B004132I4S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Age of Adz<\/a>&nbsp;(pronounced \"odds\").  The album is a departure from Stevens' most recent works, abandoning sole use of acoustic ideas in favor of electronic driven production that also incorporates acoustic elements that make Stevens so distinctive from others.  The result is a busy, overt effort that is genius for the most part.  Stevens's musicianship is apparent from the onset.\n\nThe album opens with the brief \"Futile Devices,\" which finds Stevens in the comfort of his folksy sound that he has cultivated as of late.  Stevens's vocal performance is restrained, free of extra frills and overt nuance, as we have come to expect of the somewhat mysterious singer-songwriter.  The `stripped' sound of \"Futile Devices\" is quickly contrasted by the ingenious \"Too Much,\" a cut that opens with electronics instantaneously upon the first few seconds of listening.  The ideas are extremely creative and clever, finding Stevens merging his classical music brains (he still uses mixed meters) and his progressive side almost flawlessly.  He does this all while making this rather uncommercial listen have some appeal with a simplistic, yet poignant hook (\"it's too much riding on that, it's too much, too much, too much\").  While the cut is lengthy, it is enjoyable, and the bridge between the acoustic and electronic worlds is exceptional.\n\n\"Age of Adz,\" pronounced \"odds\" is an even lengthier cut, clocking it at 8:00 in duration.  Despite the length, the orchestration is experimental with superb parts for the brass and woodwind instruments.  In addition to the acoustic instruments, Stevens once again combines electronics with his knack for orchestration to make yet another five-star rated performance.  The only complaint would be that Stevens's rather quiet, reserved vocals (even at their most overt) are covered in the bombastic production work.  The track ends, however, with strummed guitar and tender vocals by Stevens - that is the Stevens we have come to be accustomed to.\n\n\"I Walked\" is another great cut, where clear vocals by Stevens laced in falsetto stand out easily.  Again, with pop songwriter's craft, Stevens writes another simple, minimalistic hook that is relevant even to the most mainstream listener.  The classical-sounding background vocals here ad a superb touch. \"Now That I'm Older\" is solid too, even if there is a `lot to take in' and `absorb' as a listener.  \"Get Real Get Right\" contrasts a slower paced \"Now That I'm Older\" with a quicker pace here.  Additionally, vocally, Stevens gets right to the point, entering much earlier with his voice than previous cuts.  Again, pop craftsmanship is executed with a nice hook.\n\n\"Bad Communication\" is one of three relatively brief cuts on this album.  As always, Stevens use of instruments here is exceptional.  \"Vesuvius\" is a stand out after several solid tracks, which begins with Stevens recapturing his acoustic ruminations.  Before the 1:00 mark, the electronic drums enter, beginning to shape \"Vesuvius\" into another electro-acoustic masterwork.  The production work is more tasteful than more bombastic performances (\"Too Much\" or \"Age of Adz\"), which is nice to hear from Stevens after so many `jam-packed' cuts.  \"All for Myself\" is another exceptional cut and the last truly brief listen.  Here, background vocals add a creative dimension, not to mention that great compositional-sense that Stevens possesses throughout this ambitious album.  \"All for Myself\" features one of the best refrains of the album, finding Stevens singing: \"We set out once, forget our shirts with hairy chests and well rehearsed, I want it all, I want it all for myself...\"\n\n\"I Want To Be Well\" keeps up the momentous trend with a `schizophrenic' nature about it.  While it clocks in at a whopping 6:29 in duration, it is well worth the listen, if for nothing else than to hear the usually clean-cut singer drop the f-bomb: \"I'm not f***ing around, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not f***ing around.\"  Sure, that's not the sole shining (or shocking) moment, as the main refrain is not too shabby itself: \"so do yourself a good, or do yourself a death from ordinary causes...\" Closing cut \"Impossible Soul\" is truly the only questionable cut - at 25:35 it finds Stevens indulging a bit to much, even for the adept `classical music listener's' soul.  There are some superb ideas and great and shocking moments (Stevens uses auto-tune!), but it is too much.  What it does do, however, is reflect the `greatest hits' of this album, with combinations of acoustic and electronic sensibilities.\n\nExceptional album? By all means, with only few things to quibble out in my eyes.  After a five-year hiatus, I am glad one of my personal favorite musicians is back on the scene with a true, full length effort.  I highly recommend this album!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Great song, cheaper than iTunes you can not go wrong with this purchase. Plus use of the Amazon Cloud and Cloud Player make this an even better buy. In the review for the song itself, allmusic.com wrote \"The lush power ballad \"The Flame\" was penned by two British songwriters, but the band made it their own with Robin Zander's sobbing vocal dramatics and the haunting tones of Rick Nielsen's mandocello chiming behind the guitar and keyboard backing. The lyrics, almost always an afterthought in romantic power ballads, often hint at the Police\/\"Every Breath You Take\"'s school of disguising unhealthy obsession as sentimentality; the singer, unable to let go of his first love, which can be taken either as a scorned lover trying to see his failed romance as somehow cosmically ordained anyway, or as a vaguely disturbing intimation of stalking. It's more likely that the latter interpretation was completely unintentional, though, since the band's straight-ahead reading plays up the heartstring-tugging bombast. It was a perfect fit for the late-'80s' power ballad\/happy pop radio, and it was much better crafted than many similar offerings from the same period (most of which were by bands who had been influenced, indirectly or otherwise, by Cheap Trick themselves). While it isn't the most inventive song the band ever recorded, \"The Flame\" is an undeniable part of their legacy, and a well-deserved, better-late-than-never, chart-topping popular success","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"When Hank Williams wrote \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" he intended that the lyrics be spoken as opposed to being sung as he had done on several other of his early recordings. Ultimately the decision was made that Hank would sing the song and \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" was released as the\"B\" side of \"My Bucket's Got A Hole In It\" in February 1949. C&W deejays discovered the song anyway and it quickly became a favorite on Country radio and a staple of Hank's \"live\" shows. Still a large segment of the record-buying public remained unfamiliar with the tune. That all changed in 1966 when a young pop-country singer from Texas named B.J. Thomas re-imagined the song for mid-60's pop audiences. \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" by B.J. Thomas and the Triumphs would race all the way to #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April of that year. For my money this continues to be most moving version of this song ever recorded.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I have to admit: Last year when Tony Bennett made his un-American remarks about how the U.S. caused the Islamonazi terrorists to fly into the WTC towers, I was madder than a one-legged man in an a\/s\/s-kicking contest. I was so mad that I almost threw out each and every one of my Tony Bennett CDs, and I've been collecting this Social Security recipient's CDs for a while, now. However, I later learned that Tony did apologize for his un-American remarks by making a very slippery apology\/non-apology, which is all it takes to earn my forgiveness. Thus, I went out and bought Viva Duets because I don't want anything to stand in the way of my ears and Tony's awesome, succulent voice of velvet.\n\nThis album is a little different than anything that Tony's ever done because it features his favorite Latino artists sizzling up his CD with their trademark sassiness and broken English crooning. I only have a little critique of Tony, as it is very obvious from my 1st paragraph that I'm a super-fan of his. I wish that Tony had the presence of mind to include the real Latino stars in the world, and by this I mean entertainers such as the ambiguously g\/a\/y Ricky Martin, that sizzling fox called Shakiro, and, of course, the entire membership of Minudo.\n\nNonetheless, despite these glaring omissions, Tony does well on songs such as For Once In My Life with Marc Anthony and The Best Is Yet To Come with Cheyenne. The former is a song about Tony's support for the Arizona state law against illegal aliens because the federal government under Obama won't enforce existing immigration law, and the latter is about Tony's endorsement of Mitt Romney's plan to have illegal aliens self-deport themselves, senor!\n\nI think that Tony deserves our hard-earned dollars because he has already apologized with an apology\/non-apology for last year's un-American comments. I believe in his sincerity, which is why I bought this CD, and I hope that you do, too. After all, with the real unemployment rate under Obama only being about 17 percent, there are still a lot of people in this country who can still scrape together a few cents to purchase Viva Duets!","classification":5,"fold":4}

I had absolutely no idea who they were but was compelled to learn about the band and their music. I am happy to say I have been converted to a full \"as the kids would say\" Directioner.  Midnight Memories was amazing, and so is their latest four. So if you love 70s and 80s classic rock with a modern twist, then you will love Four. Take a chance and download a copy of this album you won't regret it. Where do broken hearts go, fire proof, 18, fools gold, Stockholm Syndrome, and steal my girl are some of my favorites.  Also if you do discover that you like this album go back and down load Midnight Memories you will not regret that decision I promise.","classification":5,"fold":4}

This was in fact one of tmy intros to African music, but it's very good as an example of excellent hip hop shortly before Run DMC saved the genre from dying out.

{"text":"Tank has always been one of the most overlooked and underrated R&B singers since the 2000's. Though he is an exceptional contemporary R&B singer that has had a small handful of solo hits and modest record sales, he is probably more know for his excellent songwriting and production of other major R&B artists. In a lot of ways, I like to think Tank is kind of like a very very poor man's R. Kelly (Just Speaking in terms of chart success, not Poor Man in terms of talent). Much like R. Kelly, Tank normally writes, produces, plays and sings his own music along with the music he contributes to other artists. He has worked with a extensively long list of grade A R&B singers over the past five years, like Jamie Foxx, Omarion, Donell Jones, Joe, Keith Sweat, Marques Houston, Pleasure P, Fantasia, Keri Hilson, Toni Braxton, Chris Brown, Monica and Day 26 just to name a few... And while Tank has never been a truly standout artist\/producer\/songwriter, he should be a lot more popular as he makes some of the best modern day R&B music out, weather its his music or someone elses. And while I do think he is very underrated, he has managed to have 4 successful singles, 900,000 records sold amongst his first three solo albums, and he's gotten nominated for four grammy's, two of those nominations were for his own solo music. But even with that very impressive resume, he still tends to get overlooked quite often, and unfortunately I think that trend will continue on this long awaited Now Or Never album...While I'm sure he will have a decent first week sales (His last album, 2007's Sex, Love & Pain managed to move 100,000 in the first week surprisingly), Now Or Never will most likely fall off very fast much like his last album. But never the less, that doesnt detract from his super talent.\n\nLike I stated above, Tank has never really had that \"Breakthrough\" success in terms of his solo career. He's one of those artists who has a hit here and there and sells a decent amount of records (Enough to keep him afloat), but never truly breaks into the mainstream for good. The first time people really remember hearing Tank, was probably with his first solo hit, the slow jam ballad \"Maybe I Deserve\", which ended up being his first and only top 40 hit and probably his biggest hit to date. The single was lifted from his 2001 debut album, Force Of Nature, which managed to go gold, probably due to the success of that hit. Now though, Force of Nature has slipped out of print, and is considered a rare collectors item if you can manage to get your hands on a copy. Force of Nature itself though, was honestly a pretty miserable album, which is probably why it only had one hit. It was very awkward and it sounded like Tank didn't really know what he was trying to accomplish with the record. The production was bad, the songwriting was sub-par at best, and the songs were just kind of boring, which is why I'm kind of surprised people are willing to pay upwards of 50 dollars for the album. Besides the two singles and maybe one other track on the album, the rest of the album was very bland. So when it came time for round two from Tank in late 2002, people were definitely skeptical. His second album, 2002's One Man, was unfortunately much to similar to his debut. Again besides the singles (the title track and a party track titled \"Let Me Live\"), there wasn't a whole to offer on the album. Although I will admit, it was a step forward from his last album, as there were at least a few tracks on the album that were worth listening to more than once. But overall, One Man still wasn't up to par with other contemporary R&B albums being released at the time, not even close really. Not to mention the album failed to have even one single achieve chart success, causing the album to flop even harder than his debut. So after his first to albums failed to meet expectations (Critically and Commercially), Tank disappeared for quite a lengthy period of time, although he was still producing and writing for other artists, but he wasn't getting a whole lot of attention for it. Tank didn't resurface in the music industry as a singer again until 2005 when he released a promotional single titled \"I Love Them Girls\", which also went unnoticed, though it was a fantastic stripper anthem lol So in early 2007, when he finally started to make his official comeback as a solo artist with his first single from his third studio album, Sex, Love & Pain, it had felt like he was gone for more than five years, especially since a lot of people didn't even know he released an album back 2002. So needless to say, the anticipation for Sex, Love & Pain was high. Especially since he finally started to get more recognition for his production credits on other artists records, most noteworthy his work on Jamie Foxx's Unpredictable album which ended up being one of the best and most successful albums of 2005\/2006. So like I said, expectations were sky high (Including mine). The Sex, Love & Pain album ended up being a pretty successful album for him, especially since the first single \"Please Don't Go\" ended up being one of the more popular R&B singles of the year, and serving as the true comeback record for him earning him two grammy nominations. All in all, Sex, Love & Pain was by far his best album at the time, mostly because his production and songwriting had gotten sooooo much better over that five year gap between albums, probably due to how in demand he was during that time as a producer for other big name R&B artists. Not to mention he was taken in as part of one of the best R&B production teams of the past 10 years, The Underdogs. But with that said, and even though SL&P was his best album, I still can't deny that it was disappointing somewhat. It could have been the sky high expectations, or it could have been the fact that the album itself just wasn't that great still. Don't get me wrong, it definitely wasn't nearly as bad as his first two albums, it wasn't bad at all, but it still felt like it was missing something that made it a truly good or great standout R&B album...\n\nSo now, three and a half years later, we are in kind of the same spot with his newest album, 2010's Now Or Never. Tank has had a tendency to take his sweet time with his albums, especially his two most recent albums. So if Tank has perfected anything in his 10 year run in the music business, its that he has learned how to form very high anticipation for his albums. Just like Sex, Love & Pain, Now Or Never's expectations and anticipation was sky high after a three and a half year wait for the album, and over two years worth of push backs and leaks. This album has gone through it's fair share of modifications, in fact, its probably nothing like what the first original tracklisting suggested it to be. Now Or Never's original title was Sex, Love & Pain II: The All Night Experience, and it was intended to be released on his original label Blackground Records. But with almost the entire album leaked to the net before there was even a single released for the album, and a decreasing album budget with an already sinking label in Blackground, in early 2009 Tank decided to jump ship and take his talents to the SUPER label Atlantic Records, which i fully supported seeing it as he would probably finally get some good promotion and a good album budget (I mean have any of you seen the music video for his huge 2007 single \"Pleas Don't Go\" from Blackground records??? Talk about a low budget video). So he scrapped the entire Sex, Love & Pain II album in summer of 09, and started working on a totally new record, to be titled...you guessed it, Now Or Never. So in summer of 2010 when the rare up tempo banger\/baby maker \"Sex Music\" was released as the first single to lukewarm ratings and chartings, the album was again pushed back from it's September 21st release date, to a November 2nd release, making the anticipation grow even more. And I honestly don't understand how \"Sex Music\" was such a flop on the charts, because it had everything Tank would have needed to have a radio smash...it had banging club beat, seductive lyrics, and instantly catchy hook, not to mention the song was just flat out great and super addictive. So honestly I was glad that the single floppped, because I just didn't want it to get over played on the radio, and \"Sex Music\" ended up serving more as a promo single than an actual single. But then unfortunately, the album got pushed back yet again, this time to a December 14th release date. The second single released was a typical Tank ballad about heartbreak in \"Emergency\", which was another great classic Tank track, that reminded a lot of fans and critics alike of Pleasure P's baby maker \"Under\", which coincidentally was also produced by Tank. And again, similar to \"Sex Music\", \"Emergency\" never really gained any steam on the charts, so far peaking at number 47 on the R&B charts, which signifies another failed single for Tank's Now Or Never album...But at least it didn't get pushed back this time, and now the album has finally arrived. And after just one listen I could immediately tell that it was by far Tank's best album. What seperates Now Or Never from Tank's previous albums, is the production and the vibe of the album. On Tank's previous records, like I stated earlier, the production and songwriting had a tendency to be bland at times (Actually more often than not), causing his previous albums to drag in some parts. But on Now Or Never he steps up not only his production, but his contributors also bring their A game. Like on \"Scream\", the Jim Jonsin produced piano tinged ballad about screaming, and not just sexually, is definitely a standout. And on the smooth babymaker \"Amazing\", Tank uses his soft falsetto to caress the gentle beat, and what Tank claims to be his favorite track on the album \"Can I\", is also another extremely steamy baby maker and probably the best song on the album, which if played at the right moment it's promised someone will become pregnant. And the mid tempo acoustic driven \"Keep It 100\" is another standout heartbreak ballad, produced by Tank and his production team Song Dynasty, who dominates the production on the record. And the Drake assisted mid tempo club banger \"Celebration\", produced by R&B duo The Stereotypes, is probably Tank's last hope for a hit single on this Now Or Never album, as its probably one of the more catchy songs on the album. The cover of Bonnie Rait's love ballad \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" is also surprisingly another standout, as Tank makes the track his own with his amazing vocals on the track. Thats another thing I want to point out about this record, is that vocally Tank has never sounded better than he does on this album. His smooth vocals just glide across all of these tracks almost effortlessly, making it very clear as to why I have always thought Tank has one of the best most mature contemporary R&B voices among the rather large group of modern day R&B singers. All in all, Now Or Never isn't going to be the best album of the year by any means, nor will it have any sort of tremendous chart success either, but it's the first Tank album that there isn't an ounce of disappointment in me about the record. It's the first Tank album to truly meet and exceed my expectations, which i was honestly starting to become skeptical if he would ever be able to give us a truly great or even a solidly good contemporary R&B album, after his first three records were mediocre at best. But it's finally happended, and Now Or Never proves that Tank is more than just a excellent producer\/songwriter, he is also an excellent solo R&B artist.\n\nGrade:\nB","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"The xx have always had a special place in my music collection.  Sure they aren't my all time favorite artists but they are definitely one of my top go-to groups.  Their first album was an instant atmospheric guitar twirling classic that showcased their ability to fuse indie rock with nightclub vibes.  Their second album focused a lot more on the nightclub vibes and lost one of the key guitarists that made the first album so great, but it was still a great almost underrated second album.  Ever since, I've been patiently waiting for any announcement on a new xx album.  I knew Jamie was the main producer and beat maker of the album, and he had his own sorta solo effort a few years back in the form of a collaboration remix collection with Gil Scott Heron.  I thought it had the great production and style of the xx but with Gils soulful raw voice, but I didn't really give it much attention.  So then I hear some of Jamies solo songs leading up to this album.  Songs like 'Girl' and 'Sleep Sound' were mesmerizing.  Then he released the song 'Loud Places', which featured his xx bandmate Romy, along with an awesome video.  It made me even more excited, even though I knew Romy wouldn't be on the entire album.  Usually I stay away from almost entirely instrumental albums, but once the album finally came out I gave it a listen on Spotify and I couldn't resist.  It was some of the classiest electronic music I've heard.  I had to have it physically.  After multiple listens so far, here is my track by track review.\n\n1.  Gosh: This opener has an urgent feeling to it.  The bass thumps as the beat runs along.  The chants of 'Oh my gosh' are somewhat humorous but they work well.  This is the type of song you'd hear during a chase scene in an action movie and I like it.  Also good to listen to during a workout.  The last half of the song takes a different approach with its ominous bass and playful siren-like synths closing the song perfectly. 9.5\/10\n2.  Sleep Sound: This version sounds different than the one released beforehand, and I like it a lot.  The song features some heavenly plucking sounds along with a distant soothing bass.  There are also these strangely appealing sounds throughout that seem to be that of voices put through some vocal effect.  This is really an out of this world sexy song that needs to be played loud whether in a car or at home or on some decent headphones.  I can see this being played a lot when I go to the beach during the summer.  10\/10\n3.  SeeSaw featuring Romy: The ending of the last song merges into this song nicely.  The drums are faster and the synths are so beautiful.  Romys evangelic vocals sore in the near distance throughout the song.  If the xx release a new album soon I'd love to hear more of this side to them!  Definitely a new house classic.  10\/10\n4.  Obvs: There is a slight tropical vibe similar to Jamies production in The xx song 'Reunion'.  But things just keep building up and the song ends in a totally different place than it began which always leaves me in awe.  There are even distant Lion King style howls in the distance in some parts that make me feel relaxed.  10\/10\n5.  Just Saying: I saw the short length and thought I'd be disappointed.  Its a very soothing interlude that I'm sure would work great in a movie soundtrack.  I think I hear some Romy in it at a certain part.  I just wish it was longer.  Not really disappointed, as its a good relaxer, but still not one of my favorites.  8\/10\n6.  Stranger In A Room featuring Oliver Sim: The other xx bandmate song.  It gives off the illusion that it might be a fast song with its quick synths, but it's probably the slowest vocal featured song on the album.  Its impossible not to compare it to the xx since Oliver is the prominent singer in more songs than Romy.  Reminds me a bit of 'Fiction' from the band, but of course without the beat.  Great beautifully sad song as always.  Its a nice midpoint for the album.  9\/10\n7.  Hold Tight: The first half sounds like something Trent Reznor would be proud of.  Then the second half speeds up with its drums.  Another one that sounds worthy of being part of some climatic action sequence in a movie. 8.5\/10\n8.  Loud Places featuring Romy: Such a beautiful song.  The production just sounds the perfect soundtrack for a soothing night out in the big city.  Romy even shows off her xx guitars even if only slightly in the background.  Of course the ending lyrics leave that lasting mark on your heartstrings.  It's a perfect song.  I don't know what else to say.  10\/10\n9.  I Know There's Gonna Be(Good Times) featuring Young Thug and Popcaan: This really sounds out of place among the other songs.  But does that make it bad?  No way.  This is one of the catchiest xx related songs.  The beat and synths were made for the club.  The Hip Hop\/R&B vocals are delivered undeniably well even if its in a style foreign to others on the album.  I can already see Hip Hop artists hearing this and begging to have Jamie produce for them.  Hopefully the xx's next album explores this style more but without the constant swearing.  The band itself just doesn't work well with vulgar lyrics, but this song does, and I'll be jamming to it all summer.  I can see this being the big hit of the album maybe.  10\/10\n10.  The Rest Is Noise:  This is beautiful 'noise'.  Its dreamy and fast paced production with heavenly vocal howls throughout in the distance remind me of M83.  There is also a synth moment that is very similar if not the same as that of 'SeeSaw' accompanied by a gorgeously elegant piano.  It then transitions into a club song in the last two minutes smoothly.  Its the longest song on the album but it doesn't feel long enough.  I could listen to this alone on replay for hours and not get tired of it.  11\/10\n11.  Girl:  That groovy bass throughout is....groovy.  There is more of those otherworldly vocal chants throughout the song.  Toward the end there is an industrial part that I wish was longer as it also features some nice guitars.  It's a great song and a decent closer to the album, but I feel like the previous song would've closed the album better.  Still good.  9.5\/10\n\nSo this was a great album to vibe to especially for a summer soundtrack and late nights out on the town during any season.  I was on a Pixies binge when this album came out.  They are my favorite group and a totally different sound altogether.  But this album broke me away from that binge.  Thats how worthy and great this is.  If you like The xx, you'll either love this or hate it.  If you love House\/Electronic\/Dance then you'd be in for a treat with this collection of songs.  I can tell this will be revisited throughout the summer and many summers to come.  Jam to it at home or relax to it.  Use it as background music as you get things down around your place or while you study.  Drive through the night with it as your soundtrack.  Go to the gym and workout\/stretch to the vibes of this.  Close your eyes and lay down while the album takes you somewhere in your thoughts.  Open your eyes and maybe even go for a nice stroll if you can with this guiding your steps.  It's basically an electronic album that would work well as a soundtrack to almost anything you do.  I love it, and as I said before, I hope Jamies band The xx explores more of the sounds heard here. These thoughts I've expressed in this review were after at least 5 listens through.  Upon my first listen I wasn't really impressed, but I urge you to push forward with repeated listens like I did so this can fully seep into your mindset.  This is really worth the money whether you download it or buy the actual album.  Probably the best album of any genre in 2015 at the time of its release in my opinion.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"This is a very good Vivaldi set and an excellent bargain, particularly at the introductory price of $1.99. The recordings are overwhelmingly by Budapest Strings, a well-respected Hungarian ensemble I saw in concert several times, always with great pleasure, when I used to live in Budapest.\n\nBudapest Strings has recorded quite a bit of Vivaldi on the Naxos, Capriccio and LaserLight labels. While I can't be 100% sure, I suspect much of this material may be those same recordings released here under some kind of licensing arrangement. The quality of the performances are all very good to excellent.\n\nThe set starts out with the ubiquitous \"The Four Seasons\", which I always think I've heard too many versions of already. But this one stood out for me as being particularly lively and engaging. I'm still a little tired of The Four Seasons, which seems to be obligatory fare almost any collection of classical music that has the number \"99\" in the title, but this is quite a good performance. The other performances are of similar high quality. I particularly enjoyed the slow, tragic Sinfonia in B minor \"Al Sancto Sepolcro\" -- RV 169.\n\nOne of the positives on the set is that it includes, with very few exceptions, complete works rather than excerpts.\n\nA negative, however, is the lazy track listing, which has been a frequent issue on previous collections from Cobra Entertainment as well. Vivaldi's works are generally identified by their \"RV\" (Ryom-Verzeichnis) catalog number. This is important since Vivaldi had a lot of different concertos for a lot of different instruments in his total 813 cataloged works, and to keep them straight the RV number is very handy. It would be nice if it had been included for all the works here rather than on just selected works.\n\nTotal download size for 4 hours and 20 minutes of music is 433 MB, and the bitrates are variable, averaging a respectable 210-237 kbps.\n\nThis is a good set of serious Vivaldi recordings. Warmly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":4}

Sure, we have the Black Eyed Peas, but before, Jackson stood by his name as the King of Pop.\n\nBeat It is his signature song. It tells about an anonymous person ending up meeting a gang (Or so I assume), and the people in the gang seem like as if they want to injure the person. Now, that may not be the actual storyline in the song, but seriously, what do you think of after hearing this: \"They're out to get you.

The production consists of a laid back and chill vibe with a slow bpm.  The sound is very cohesive and it transitions well but the tracks come off repetitive and not attention grabbing; only the Neptune's track catches the ear.  Wiz Khalifa delivers a decent but rather lazy performance, literally talking about that same ol' jazz: marijuana, money, lavish living.

{"text":"Cher's massive comeback album BELIEVE is a pretty good collection of dance songs with positive messages of strength through hard times. The title track brought Cher back and was a mega hit, helping the album sell millions worldwide. It was played EVERYWHERE in late 1998\/1999 for a long time to come. I was never tired of it though, it's a great song. The second single was the disco infused \"Strong Enough\", not a favorite of mine but another positive song with a great underlying message. \"All Or Nothing\" was my favorite single, but it didn't really catch on. That song just does something to me, but it's just amazing. Great song! \"D'ove L'amore\" was also a single, and the remixes were quite nice. Actually, all the remixes for the singles during this era were exceptionally well done. I never cared much for \"The Power\", that's one I usually skip over, but the rest of the album is great. We have a new remix version of \"We All Sleep Alone\", which has always been one of my favorite Cher songs. \"Takin Back My Heart\" has a similar theme that \"Strong Enough\" does, and \"Runaway\" has a similar sentiment too. All great songs though. \"Taxi Taxi\" is nice, a bit odd, sounds more like a b-side track though. Overall, a really solid collection of songs from the divine Cher!","classification":4,"fold":4}

This is the one and only live album featuring Tony Martin on Vocal.  Good or bad, you have to acknowledge if you are a sabbath fan that tony martin had 5 albums with sabbath, and I really enjoy the work he did.  He has great power in vocals, and back by the solid riffs of Toni Iommi, what a match.  This Live VHS\/CD features Toni Iommi, Tony Martin, Geezer Butler, and Bobby Rondinelli (drums), Geoff Nichols (keybords, backing vocals), noting Bobby as a very accomplished drummer, and Geoff as an \"unofficial\" sabbath member since 1979's Heaven and Hell.  VHS 16 tracks :\n\n1. Time Machine\n\n2. Children of the Grave\n\n3. I Witness\n\n4. Mob Rules\n\n5. Into the Void\n\n6. Anno Mundi\n\n7. Black Sabbath\n\n8.  Neon Knights\n\n9. Psychophobia\n\n10.  Wizard\n\n11. Cross of Thorns\n\n12. symptom of the universe\n\n13. headless cross\n\n14. Paranoid\n\n15. Iron Man\n\n16.  Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\n\nThe CD is 13 track, same order minus Mob rules, Anno Mundi, and  Neon Knights.\n\nThe mastering and sound on the VHS and CD are second to none, and it is the most comprehensive set of Black sabbath work played on a stage by the group, covering all camps from the Dio fans to the Ozzy forever gang.  It does miss the 2 albums Born again (ian gillen) and Seventh Star (Glenn Hughes), but you can't have everything.  Tony is spot on with his guitar work, sounding just like it was layed down in the studio. This is a must have Item for a comprehensive sabbath fan. Hopefully, you can get the complete set with CD and VHS.  Unfortunately, I don't think we will ever see this on CD since IRS records went belly up, and Sharron Osbourne has her hands into everything (e.g. the sad re-release of the Ozzy catalog, ouch bad memories).

This isn't just the best thing MCR has done ever, it may be the best album I've heard all year (or at least it's in the top 5).\n\nThere isn't any part of Danger Days that drags. It's fast-paced, it's fun, it's sometimes extremely touching. It has a concept that it sticks to throughout, but all of the songs could also make sense out of context. It's the kind of CD that you could listen to over and over and not be bored.\n\nDanger Days shows a lot of musical talent, a great understanding of showmanship, even if it's just through speakers, songwriting ability, and fantastic focus on detail. It doesn't just tell a story, it creates its own world. It's sort of like they took everything they've ever tried to accomplish on an album and turned it up to 11. I, for one, am so impressed and thrilled that it exists.\n\nI was planning on listing highlights of the album, but now I'm having trouble picking just a few. I'll give it a try though.

Man, she's gone and she's not coming back and you've been hanging out in a park with a bunch of kids for a whole month? What is wrong with you? The guy eventually admits that he's been used to havin someone to lean on, and now...well, I guess he has to make his own dinner and do his own laundry. At least he can go to the movies, or 'picture shows' if you will...by himself. Awww, he'll find someone else in another month...then he'll be singing 'I don't care if you've seen her, don't tell me if you've seen her.'\n\nAs another day comes to an end, I'm lookin for a letter or somethin'...come on dude, that's just sad.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Here we go again! Another great Box of classical music from Bach Guild. This time, it an assemblage of some of the most famous and popular concertos in the violin literature, at their usual ridiculously low price of 99 cents. Phil's excellent review has covered the waterfront when it comes to duplications and previous releases of this music, so my review is going to focus on my observations on the performances.\nI haven't listened to everything but I've done extensive sampling, and for me, so far, David Oistrakh's rendition of a comparative rarity, the Glazunov Concerto, is alone worth the price of admission. This is a big, schmaltzy, romantic concerto--instantly accessible--and Oistrakh plays the living daylights out of it. The Glazunov Concerto is probably not a masterpiece, but Oistrakh makes it almost sound like one. His big, beefy tone is a perfect match for this music, and he really sells that Russian schmaltz.  Kondrashin provides excellent support as the conductor.\nEverything I've heard by Mischa Elman is excellent. I'm currently listening to Elman in Lalo's Symphonie Espagnole, with the underrated Vladimir Golschman leading the good old Vienna State Opera Orchestra (a Bach Guild standby) with real style. Golschman and the VSOO also back Elman in each of his other efforts. Some might find Elman a bit romantic in Bach, but I like my Bach in just about any style, as long as it's well played. Let's say that this is typical \"Bach Guild\" Bach, on modern instruments, with moderate vibrato, and at sensible tempos, neither exceedingly fast nor excessively slow. This is kind of performing style is just fine with me.\nJosef Suk is one of the great Mozartians, IMHO, and these performances are really excellent. However, I think everything here is a duplicate from either the the Big Violin Box or the Big Mozart Box. Still, its nice to have them here with these other important concertos.\nViolinist Yuzuko Horigome is a new one on me, and I haven't yet formed a firm opinion. She can certainly play that fiddle, but she may be a little bit emotionally detached for the Bruch pieces she's playing. However, I've just done a few quick samples. OK, I take it back. Having finished the Lalo, I've now moved on to the Bruch Scottish Fantasy, and I'm liking it more and more. I'm particularly taken with Simonov's vivid conducting of the Royal Philharmonic. I assume these are newer recordings, and the sound is very good.\nThat leads me to what has been, so far, the one real disappointment of the set: the performances by Joseph Silverstein. He was the concertmaster of the BSO for many years, and beyond that, an important figure in American musical life. Moreover, he was just great on a live Brahms Double Concerto I have with William Steinberg. So I was eager for a number of reasons to hear his contributions to this set.\nBut...he conducts the Utah Symphony himself in all of the concertos he performs, and for me the results are just \"meh.\" One key problem is that he doesn't seem to be a very effective conductor, at least with a fiddle in his hand. The Utah Symphony was a fine band under their maestro and taskmaster Maurice Abravanel, but here they seem to be just going through the motions. Plus, for me, Silverstein simply lacks that acute level of virtuosity we have come to expect in recordings of such magnificent warhorses as the Mendelssohn, Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart 5, and Tchaikovsky concertos, where he's up against the likes of Milstein, Heifetz, Stern, Oistrakh, Perlman, Mutter, Vengerov...well, the list goes on.\nBeyond that, while it seems to me a violinist could effectively lead the Mozart 5--Suk is his own very fine conductor in his Mozart concertos--its just nuts to try to simultaneously conduct AND play the Brahms or Tchaikovsky, where the orchestral parts are very intricate and challenging. Even so these are valuable documents by an important American musician, and I'm glad to have them in my collection.\nSo, there you go. Despite my reservations about the Silverstein performances, this gets a big thumbs up, especially for the Oistrakh and Elman and and I think also for the Horigome too. At the price, you can't go wrong.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"OK. For once can we just judge the music on its own merits? If you like dance pop\/electronic dance music with heartfelt lyrics you will probably like this song a lot. I think the reasons this song succeeds on a few levels is because:\n\n1. \"We Can't Stop\" was a huge hit. They wanted to see what she'd do next.\n2. The lyrics are actually really heartbreaking for a tune produced like this. Not your typical, mindless 3 min. dance excursion.\n3. They saw the video (which I haven't yet so I'm not swayed by that aspect).\n\nAnyway, the song is a tragic-sounding dance pop track. It's tragic (not because it's bad) but because of the lyric descriptions she paints here. I find her first two singles paint a slightly deceiving image of the album -- you would think it was one big collection of party songs. But it's not. Some of the songs are like that but many of the songs actually have this deep emotional side (listen to the album instead of judging the image Miley gives off now). Although I do somewhat understand why someone wouldn't I think it's worth a shot to check the album out on Spotify and make up your own mind. It isn't perfect but many of the songs are decent, \"Wrecking Ball\" being the most commercial song that happens to hold weight. It honestly is a great dance ballad. I didn't think it'd turn out this way. As a side note Miley co-wrote 10 of the standard edition's tracklisting (12 if you have the deluxe).\n\nSorry for rambling. It definitely deserves to be her first number 1. \"Do My Thang\" would be a WONDERFUL third single. If the video came correct and the song got heavy airplay I could easily see it being a top 20 hit at least!\n\n5 stars.","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"What happened Ne-Yo? Everything he touched before this album turned to gold...But as soon as he disappeared for a brief period of time, it seems like he might have lost his touch a bit. I have always been at least a modest fan of Ne-Yo, more so when he first came out, his first two albums were great but as of lately he has wandered to far into the pop genre for me to tolerate. He still has all the talent in the world, and he still is a phenomenal song writer, but his style has changed a lot since he first came out, and Libra Scale is the first album of his that I would say was a definite miss. His last album (2008's Year of The Gentleman) was extremely successful despite being just an average album, but Libra Scale is lacking in both areas. It flopped and was his worst album by far. The production was weak (I don't recognize hardly any names on this album), the songwriting was bland, and just the overall vibe of the album was boring. There were a few standout cuts, the mellow baby maker \"Telekinesis\" and the mid tempo banger \"Makin a Movie\" both make lasting impressions, as do the singles \"Champagne Life\" and \"One in a Million\", but other than that the rest of the album is filler in my opinion. That was the biggest problem with this album, was there was a severe lack of standout material on the album, and it just didn't sound focused at all, kind of coming off half assed. I mean it's not the worst album i have ever heard by any means, if your a huge Ne-Yo fan you will still get a decent amount of enjoyment out of the album most likely, but as whole the album is definitely lacking, especially compared to some of his better work...Better luck next time Ne-Yo, i know the talent is still there, but this album just didn't display it like some of his other work...","classification":2,"fold":4}

One of Roger's best of his final performances when he was alive. It still surprises me that he would follow the somewhat uneven Provocative with this well sung, well performed effort.

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"I recently saw Charles Bradley in concert for the first time (more on that later). Bradley is known as having the uncanny ability to personify, if not channel, the James Brown spirit, while at the same time having a wonderful R&B voice. This is Bradley's 3rd album.\n\n\"Changes\" (11 tracks; 40 min.) opens with a quick and gospel-tinged \"God Bless America\", only to then dive straight into \"Good To Be Back Home\". The song is drenched in retro-soul just like Sharon Jones brings her stuff (they are both on the same music label, Daptone). The songs are quite focused and to the point (most of them are in the 3 to 4 min. range). Some of the album's highlights for me include the pensive \"Ain't Gonna Give It Up\", \"Crazy For Your Love\", and \"You Think I Don't Know (But I Know)\", but the reality is that there really are no weak songs on here, and the album makes for a very consistent, and coherent, listening experience.\n\nThis past weekend I saw Charles Bradley and his band, the aptly named Extraordinaires, in concert at the rapidly growing Bunbury Music Festival here in Cincinnati. They played an early evening set on the main stage that brimmed with energy. The set list was divided pretty evenly between this new album and the \"No Time For Dreaming\" album. If you haven't seen Bradley performing live yet, you haven't experienced the full Bradley experience, not by a long shot! The man is absolutely amazing. The massive crowd absolutely loved it. If you have a chance to see Bradley live, do not miss him! Meanwhile, \"Changes\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"Back in the day BOC was Huge. I loved their music and got everything they ever put out EXCEPT ONE, Imaginos. I was overseas in the Navy when it came and the 2 albums prior to this were a bit of a disappointment, SO when it came out I was busy and just didn't get around to getting it. when I did go to get it it was gone. Pulled from the shelves everywhere for what I don't know but nowhere to be found. No big deal right? I mean tha last 2 releases were rather dull so I figured BOC were tapped out,  becoming Nostalgic and Nundane. Many years before I even expressed interest in it again after I heard from others that it was actually very good. Some of the best BOC has ever done many say. Hmmmm. better get it. NOT, everybody wanted like mega bucks for a copy. Anyway when I saw it here re-released I jumped all over it. Damn glad I did. When I first listened to this and keep in mind, for 30 years I have never heard even one track from this CD, it was like hearing the latest release form one of my favorite bands and it rocks. As a whole I give it an 8 on a 10 scale but there are about 5 songs on this that are the best BOC has ever done. Those songs get a solid 10. Buck is blazingly fast and imaginitive. ie the title Imaginos. These are Blockbuster, Genious Level Guitar Riffs that prove once again that Buck Dharma is one of the greatest guitarists alive and way too many people have never heard of him. A shame really. BOC has a Dark Inteligent perspective that always kept them to, well, cult following status. I am a member of that BOC Cult. I like just hearing this now because it truly feels new and fresh to me. I know it came out in 1978 or 79, and it is now 2008. But you can'yt tell that from hearing this for the first time. It sounds like so much of BOC's greates work. Classic and Timeless. If like me you are a BOC fan and you don't have this. You already know from the years that you gotta have it. If you are a new BOC fan or wondering if this is Vinatge BOC or just mediocrity from BOC, let me assure you this will top your collection as some of BOC's finest and without a doubt Buck Dharma soundly places himself in the Guitar God Status like he wasn't there already.\n\nKev.","classification":5,"fold":4}

In my humble opinion, it's about as potent as their previous efforts like 'Number Of The Beast', 'Piece Of Mind' or 'Powerslave'. But these British merchants of metal mayhem seem to have put out SO many releases now, I've sort of lost track. Best thing about 'Somewhere' is they'd decided to now employ a synthesizer in their sound, very wise move. Tracks I remember the most off this CD reissue are the album's single \"Wasted Years\", \"Sea Of Madness\", \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" (love the old MTV video) and \"Heaven Can Wait\". Cut to the chase, if you were a fan of '80's metal (like I was \/ still am), then you should check out this catalog title.","classification":4,"fold":4}
{"text":"I liked Bread when I was young (but often didn't admit it). Back then I took a little kidding for liking Bread when the \"cool\" people were into more edgy music.\n\nWhen I recently I learned Bread's music was spoke to my brother and sister-in-Law's deepest feelings for each other I sought out the \"Best of Bread\" album. I'm glad I did because it renewed my interest and reminded me how much I liked their music. \"If\" is one of several favorites on the \"best of\" album,  \"If\" spoke to my late teen romantic heart. Hearing it now helps remind me of the feeling of those formative years.\n\nFor my brother and sister-in-law \"If\" is more than other Bread songs they like \"their\" song. Just listening she can't help but let loose a tear. This makes it even more special to me and I'm certain it brings up special feelings for many.\n\nBread provided music of the 70's that was approachable to a wider audience. While many hard rock fans dismissed them, a few decades on I appreciate them more than when they were performing. I like how much their music means to friends and family just a bit older than me too.\n\nI'm glad I gave them another look. It was well worth it and \"If\" is well worth 5 stars to me.\n\nHope this helps someone!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"Polished mosaic. A poignant description of Tantric's latest creation. Woven with layers of intricate melodies and huge, bold, rich harmonies. So crisp you could take a bite like a green apple and taste the burst of flavor! Honestly I was surprised. I was expecting something with a harder edge. This album cuts its own slice of American Pie. There are tracks with messages of social consciousness and responsibility without the element of  \"Feel Guilty bad human\" looming overhead. This troupe of musicians reminds me that there are, yes- artists who insist on putting forth their best effort. You can tell. So, what tracks stand out? Relentless is beautiful and has a very erotic rhythm to it. It's a Taqsim kind of thing. Winslow likes Change. Their rendition of Chains is indeed a compliment to Fleetwood Mac. Finesse! Chasing After- Wow, this song is like a fresh shot of double espresso. If this doesn't wake you up and get the blood going, see your doctor. This track flows into a segue with beautiful guitar and drum tracks. Falling Away- I don't think any other group can cover this song, it is truly Tantric. Can't touch this Baby! Hey Now- need I say more? Hero takes me back to an era of the `70's when life was full of California sunshine and the beach. I don't know why but that's where it takes me: San Onofre and Trestles, salty sea air and late afternoon blue skies. Rocks this ol' surfer girl. This is a very seductive album and is a must have for the true music collector. Very well worth the investment. Rich, and Winslow is never wrong!

Other tracks like \"All I Ask of You,\" \"If I Loved You\" and \"Children Will Listen\/Not While I'm Around\" are glorious.

{"text":"Bruce Springsteen seven first albums are without a doubt the canon of Bruce's music career. All music fans, not only Bruce's fanatics, will probably have at least 3 or 4 of his first albums. Bruce's hard core fans (me included) have already all of his albums in cassette, vinyl, CD, Box sets, and many bootlegs of his live shows and outtake sessions. The question that needs to be answered here, then, is whether it is worth buying these CDs one more (last?) time or not. And the answer, to save you the time of reading mine or any other reviews, is a bold YES.\n\nFirst Listen: I have purchased the CD box set, not the vinyl, so this is the one I will be commenting on. Because Amazon is so gracious to give away the mp3 version of every album you buy, I had the opportunity to listen to all of the MP3s before I got my hands down to the actual CDs. I first listened to all of the 76 tracks from my computer, which has some very decent&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/M-Audio-Studiophile-AV-40-Active-Studio-Monitor-Speakers\/dp\/B0051WAM64\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">M-Audio Studiophile AV 40 Active Studio Monitor Speakers<\/a>. But still, these are compressed tracks (MP3s) sounding via computer speakers. The difference was already notable, especially with Greetings..., The Wild..., and The River.\n\nSecond Listen: Then, I listened to the whole thing again but this time using my&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/PSB-M4U-1-Over-Ear-Audiophile-Headphones-with-Remote-Mic-Black\/dp\/B00AFUE7S6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">PSB M4U 1 Over-Ear Audiophile Headphones with Remote & Mic (Black)<\/a>. I cranked up the volume to a 75-80%, and then I started to notice the real difference between the old CDs and the new 2014 remastered versions. A couple of examples to be very specific. Ex. 1: \"Spirit in the Night\" from Greetings. Around minute 2:12 (this is the chorus). I can clearly hear the hand clapping AND congas! I never realized there were congas recorded in this song. Ex. 2: \"Independence Day\"  from The River. Around minute 2:21 (this is Clemons' sax solo). it starts with a clear brief drumming intro, then the solo, and you can hear the separation between the piano and the bass, and the imaging of the sound is done so well that the drums are clearly placed right behind, but you can tell the separation between all the ppieces of the drum set. This one song, for example (and Point Blank as well!), is one of the best examples of what exactly you are getting here. The River is one of the albums that benefits the most from this remastering. I had become so tired of the dull sound of the old The River CD transferring than The River became one of the least listened CDs among Bruce's discography. Now I can listen to this whole Rock N Roll stravaganza in all his glory!\n\nThird Listen: This time I created a Play List on my iTunes where I included the 76 newly remastered 2014 versions with all previous MP3s from the old CD transfers. Then I carefully placed every new track next to the old one, and listened to the whole thing with my headphones. Holy Cow! Did I still need another reason to be convinced these remastered are worth every penny? This was it! You can tell the difference crystal clear here. This is the point where I will discuss one of the most delicate aspects of this box: Nebraska. It is vox populi Bruce poorly recorded this album at home, and that is how it was basically released because there was really nothing sound engineers could do at the time. Thanks to the Plangent Remastering Processes used here, tape hiss is gone now, and both guitar and voice is fully enhanced with greater clarity and fullness. This is way more noticeable than the actual hiss. An analogy that may explain this very well is that the music has been \"dusted off.\" All over the 7 albums, output volumes have been adjusted and balanced, so they are louder throughout, but in balance with the imaging of all of the other recorded instruments. Bruce's voice is up front where it is supposed to be, but all instruments and voices can also be heard and differentiated throughout. This is what in my opinion creates the idea of 'clarity', which for the human ear means you can 'kind of see' where the instruments are placed (left, right, in front, or behind) the same way it would feel if you were actually attending a live performance.\n\nFourth Listen: The last listen before writing this review had to be, of course, once I got my hands down to the real CDs. No more compressed audio files here (MP3s). I have two high end stereo systems at my place, so I am really getting a state of the art audio experience. One is system is run by a Pioneer A\/V receiver, the other one is a DENON. One has Harman Kardon speakers, the other one PSB. The first one CD I played was Nebraska, and a miracle fills out the room! Then Born in the USA, and happiness and joy fill me in. Then The River, and I am totally convinced that these remasters are absolutely a must have, that this is not a rip-off (as some have suggested), and that they just got it totally right!\n\nLast thoughts: I of course own the Born to Run and Darkness DeLuxe Boxes. These remasters ARE newly done for this Album Collection, not the same that were previously done for the DeLuxe boxes. The technology used is different. As I indicated above, this time they used the Plangent Process (this is noted in the credits that accompany the box), which in my humble opinion yielded slightly better results. It is hard to make a list ranking these albums in comparison to their old CD counterparts, but if I had to, this would be it: 1. Greetings ... 2. The Wild ... (adequate credit should be given to Mike Appel, who produced these two first records)3. The River 4. Nebraska 5. BITUSA 6. Born to Run 7. Darkness. For the casual listener (non hard-core Bruce fan), this is an excellent opportunity to get Springsteen's canon at a very affordable price. By the way, Amazon price went down twenty bucks in a week. I paid $74.99 and the price is $60.99 as I am writing this. Considering you get the MP3s as a courtesy, purchasing this box on Amazon is absolutely a no brainer. I have uploaded a video on youtube where you can watch me unboxing this beauty. Unfortunately it is too large to be uploaded directly here on Amazon. Here is the link (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=l5vLZBQOEQY&feature=em-upload_owner#action=share). Next week is Thanksgiving (and Black Friday sale), and Christmas is around the corner, so I'd say this box is destined to be a hot cookie that will most likely sell by the thousands.\n\nThis music defined my growing up as a teenager, and made me the man I am today. This music means the world to me, and I owe it a whole lot. Being able to listen to it under these circumstances is a just a blessing. It keeps me singing, dancing, playing, hoping, thinking, and believing again. And they give me a slightly hint of sadness when I realize that music this good, life-changing albums as these seven are, hasn't been produced for a long time. Enjoy the music, click YES if you found this review helpful, and HAPPY LISTENING! Peace out!\n\nP.S. Did I mention that Born in the U.S.A. is just an ecstasy? Totally mind blowing this time around!\nP.S.(2) Did I say I love Bruce Springsteen? Thank you BOSS for this gift!","classification":5,"fold":4}

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nLYRICS:\nSome say love, it is a river\nThat drowns the tender reed.\nSome say love, it is a razor\nThat leaves your soul to bleed.\nSome say love, it is a hunger,\nAn endless aching need.\nI say love, it is a flower,\nAnd you its only seed.\n\nIt's the heart afraid of breaking\nThat never learns to dance.\nIt's the dream afraid of waking\nThat never takes the chance.\nIt's the one who won't be taken,\nWho cannot seem to give,\nAnd the soul afraid of dyin'\nThat never learns to live.\n\nWhen the night has been too lonely\nAnd the road has been too long,\nAnd you think that love is only\nFor the lucky and the strong,\nJust remember in the winter\nFar beneath the bitter snows\nLies the seed that with the sun's love\nIn the spring becomes the rose.","classification":5,"fold":4}

Produced by Jim Jonsin, Rico Love and with a guest feature from Lil' Wayne, this turned out to be the perfect r&b\/pop lead single from her upcoming solo album which is due this summer.  It was originally due to come out late last year but her previous dance-floor killing lead single, \"Commander,\" proved to only be successful overseas where she also released follow-up club\/pop track, \"Forever and a Day.\"  In the US, she tried two more urban inspired tracks \"Grown Woman\" and \"Rose Colored Glasses\" with no luck and decided to go back in the studio where she created this steamy, slow to mid tempo, pulsating, groove track.  Excited about the new Kelly album!","classification":5,"fold":4}

{"text":"\"Deficit\" is a very dark and moody instrumental song.  It is very atmospheric, and is something that I would expect to hear playing in the background of a movie about ghosts, as the tension is building towards the climax.  The second half of the song is a bit more upbeat, with a quicker tempo and more metallic highlights, but it would still be quite at home in a ghost movie.  It seems to drag on a bit longer than what seemed realistic for a song of this type, since the tension cannot last forever.  The weakest part of the song played out in the last 10 seconds or so, with seemingly otherworldly transmissions that didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the song.  But it was offered as part of a free promotional download, and for that, I'll round the rating up to four stars.","classification":4,"fold":4}

{"text":"The people impressed with this must not have heard New Beginnings, her last cd. This new one is so monotone and go nowhere it's a mystery as to what the heck happened. New Beginnings is one of my favorite cd's, and  Telling Stories would be my least favorite if it weren't for the title  track. This cd has no zip, zing, or pizzazz. Would someone please wake her  up?","classification":2,"fold":4}

{"text":"At least before his arrest, Phil Spector was hailed a musical genius. True, he did produce several classic singles for the Ronettes, Crystals and Righteous Brothers that are some of the most beloved Oldies from the 60s, but he was not on par with someone like Paul McCartney or John Lennon who could craft entire concept albums that remain classics 50-plus years later.\n\nI am not bashing Phil nor his music, just using my above statement to back up my two-star review for this CD that is only worth getting for HES A REBEL, DA DOO RON RON and THEN HE KISSED ME. The other songs on here are nowhere near as good as the three hits. Its too bad that the Crystals didn't have better material, but I feel a little of Phils sound went a long wayit only worked with the right melodies and lyrics, and the rest of whats here is lacking. I fell in love with the Crystals hits back in the early 80s and actually liked them better than the Shirelles or the Chiffons back then. But Ive heard a few of the Shirelles albums recorded in the 60s and even the deep album cuts are much better than the second-string hits found here by The Crystals. The sound quality on this CD isn't the best either. Sorry, cant recommend this.","classification":2,"fold":4}

Fear Factory works obsolete & digimortal. progressive Industrial Death Metal music. but if you are a marilyn manson fan I just was wanting better music, and I feel fear factory have realy step up & so have Slipknot the gray chapter.","classification":2,"fold":4}
{"text":"When it has came down to Katy Perry, the quality of her music and her voice has absolutely died in cheap theatrics and lacking real talent. Her songs just haven't been able to hit the nail on the head in the eye and ears have shown in regards to tracks like I Kissed A Girl and Roar have shown. But not everything is really worth the money, and absolutely not even worth the time resolved from her marriage with Russell Brand. Dark Horse, the latest single from her album Prism is absolutely not a really driven song from her voice. Trying to be more of a street kind of sound, has weakened her talent in her voice. She and Juicy J not only do not have any chemistry, but the rhythm just isn't the best of Katy Perry in voice. Perhaps she needs to grow up, and find more from her own dark horse.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":4}

{"text":"Ive gotta admit that after La Gargola, which probably became my favorite Chevelle release, I was anxious for what The North Corridor was going to bring. My anticipation turned to disappointment upon my first listen. There was far too much CLONG-CLONGCLONG-CLONG-CLONG bass and Petes singcreaming stripped songs of any nuance. After a few more listens I can say that TNC has grown on me, but not much. The album is a blisterer and the nuances are there but they're buried pretty good. The overbearing power chords, punk rock drums, the monotonous bass lines, and that singcreaming! It beats you over the head pretty relentlessly. Its Chevelle, tightly wound. I like it when they're a little looser, allow some quieter moments to carry you into heavier moments, focus on some longer melodies, and have Pete screaming a lot less. If I was grading this after the first listen it would have been a 2 star, leaning toward 1. After listening to it a few more times over a few different speaker systems I can appreciate the music more, I certainly hear more of second guitar lines that imbue the songs with that much more interest (like on Young Wicked) but its simply not all that prominent throughout this release, and the music creeps my rating up to a 3 star but the singcreaming just ruins it altogether this time around. All in all a still disappointing 2.5 stars. I won't be listening to this one much.","classification":2,"fold":4}

{"text":"Wow, I don't know anything by FL other than that cool -albeit morbid- track about everyone being dead at some point, but like many others I've listened to a few Beatles records and plenty of Beatles tributes and covers version of their catalogue.  So I do appreciate Flaming Lips putting a unique spin on these oft' heard tracks. Instead of merely copying them, as has been done before. I've enjoyed the wonderful BIG DADDY doo-wop take on this LP and it works on many levels, and everyone from Cheap Trick (recent live) to Dub All Stars reggae groves have taken a run at SPLHCB. Unfortunately this CD doesn't compare to anything I've liked about the Beatles. As each track started in my player, I hoped for the best, but from high pitched and whiny vocals to purposely out of tune guitars and a mish mosh of sounds, none of this worked at all for me. Some tracks had an ok vocal but I missed the drums, some tracks had a ok sound track but the singing ruined what might have been a decent sound-bed. If I were to play a track on a Breakfast with the Beatles style Sunday Morning radio program, to tell the world there was a new Flaming Lips Beatles CD, I'd probably go with \"Lovely Rita\". It was the best of the lot. This disc of music doesn't benefit anyone.","classification":2,"fold":4}
