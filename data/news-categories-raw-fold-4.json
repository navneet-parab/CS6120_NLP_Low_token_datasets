As the outrage went viral, the hunter became the hunted. His clinic's website was shut down, and a White House petition demanding extradition got 190,000 signatures. But the level of viral indignation also prompted some to question why the outpouring of outrage for Cecil surpassed that prompted by the killing of Sandra Bland. At the same time, we watched as Ohio prosecutor Joe Deters -- fueled by very disturbing bodycam footage of the police shooting of Samuel DuBose -- announced murder charges in the case, calling the incident \"outrageous,\" \"horrendous\" and an \"absolute tragedy.\" It was further proof of the power of images -- and that outrage doesn't have to be an either\/or proposition.","classification":"POLITICS","fold":4}

A quarter of the country is unemployed, including half of its young people. Pensions have been slashed. The health budget has been cut by 40 percent. Suicides are up 36 percent since 2008. The Troika has authored a new Greek myth -- that you can cut your way to growth. And now they're back, demanding more of what's already shattered the economy. The question is will they shatter the spirit of the Greek people? Just as we value our independence, so do the Greeks, who, after all, invented democracy.

It might have been more civil in tone, but it was actually much more frightening than the brawls of previous debates. Gone was the extreme rudeness, but as a result the extreme policies were harder to miss. Asked about torture and targeting civilians, Trump said that while we \"have to obey the laws,\" we should simply \"expand those laws,\" presumably to legalize what's currently illegal. When asked if all 1.6 billion Muslims hate us, he calmly replied, \"a lot of them\" do. Meanwhile, Rubio's answer to climate change was that we can't \"change a law in Washington to change the weather!\" And all suggested that we need to once again send ground troops to the Mideast (what could possibly go wrong?). Finally, when asked about increasing violence at his rallies, Trump blamed it on his supporters' anger about trade deals. And just days later, his canceled rally in Chicago nearly turned into a full-scale riot. Making America great again, indeed. Some have compared this to a reality show. If only that were true. This is reality, and we're all losing.","classification":"POLITICS","fold":4}

Defiant to the end, the philosopher voluntarily drank the poison himself in a suicidal display of dignity.\n\nThis weekend, Greek voters will decide in a referendum whether they will be force-fed more painful austerity, imposed by the jury of other European democracies, or, like Socrates, administer their own poison in a \"no\" vote that will likely push Greece out of the eurozone. Tragedy, too, such as we are witnessing today, had its origins in early Greek drama.\n\nNobel Laureate Joe Stiglitz and Martin Guzman argue that Greece will be better off administering the poison by its own hand. As they point out by examining the Argentine default in 2001, there is \"life after debt and default.\" Manolis Glezos, the elderly firebrand of Syriza, writes from Athens that, in a democracy, \"the people are the measure\" of their fate.

In more news from dysfunctional D.C., Attorney General-Designate Loretta Lynch remains in limbo, her nomination held hostage by Senate Republicans for over five months. On Friday, a clearly frustrated President Obama demanded, \"Call Loretta Lynch for a vote...This is embarrassing.\" Meanwhile, the bigger \"news\" was the breathless scoop of Hillary Clinton eating at Chipotle.
