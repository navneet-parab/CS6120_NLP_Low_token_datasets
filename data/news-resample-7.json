Laura Ingraham declared \"there has to be something wrong with you,\" and Byron York said it was \"a step backward\" for the GOP. It's shocking that Jeb didn't have a prepared answer to this elephant sitting in the middle of his campaign headquarters, but heartening to see how far establishment thinking has come on Iraq.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump postponed his Friday announcement of running mate Mike Pence because, according to campaign manager Paul Manafort, Trump \"reacted emotionally\" to the Nice attack. There were also reports that, as of late Thursday night, Trump was making calls to see if he could reverse his choice of Pence (a man who wrote that \"global warming is a myth,\" smoking \"doesn't kill\" and apparently doesn't believe in evolution). Uncertain and unsteady times call for steady and clear-eyed leadership -- not emotionally driven, ad hoc improvising and posturing.

One is the complete paralysis of the European Union as a government able to take emergency action. The humanitarian crisis is happening right now in real time, but the EU operates by consensus if not unanimity and it operates with agonizing slowness. Several nations don't want anything to do with refugees. Hungary's brutal response is more candid and ugly than others, but in this story there are few heroes. One hero is the Prime Minister of Sweden, Stefan L\u00f6fven. Sweden has been more generous to refugees and immigrants than most nations, and now faces a backlash.","classification":"POLITICS","fold":7}

{"index":41470,"text":"The first principle of an open society is not to let the intolerant define \"the territory of insult\" -- those areas off limits to criticism or ridicule. But how does one define \"territory\" when media now crosses the boundaries of nations, cultures and civilizations?\n\nIn the end, free societies must defend the right of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists against murder by fanatics, the Sony filmmakers against the North Korean regime and novelists like Salman Rushdie against a fatwa from the ayatollahs. But isn't Pope Francis also right that, in today's diverse and connected world, we must exercise the civil restraint of \"respect\" for the non-fanatic faithful (see the other depiction of the Prophet acceptable among some Muslims on left above), even if we insist on irreverence toward political authority?\n\nFinding an equilibrium amid the frictions and fusions that abound in this global public space will determine whether or not we can forge a new cosmopolitan commons of the 21st century.\n\nThis week, The WorldPost engages this conundrum. Writing from Denmark, Flemming Rose, the Jyllands-Posten editor who commissioned cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad a decade ago that set off riots across the Muslim world, argues against \"the tyranny of silence\" fanatics would impose.
