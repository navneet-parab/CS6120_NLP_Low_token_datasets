{"text":"When it has came down to Miley Cyrus, she has tried so hard to escape and shed her teen image from her Hannah Montana days, yet she made herself become more raunchy in her work and definitely lost her credibility in her voice. The songs from her last record were terrible, and the songs so far she had pulled out there from her Bangerz record just haven't cut the stamina either. Well, she has tried that again with Adore You, the third single from the album. The song though is at least a halfway decent ballad that can show Miley's voice better than the wasted songs she had put out from the album before like We Can't Stop and Wrecking Ball. Still, Miley has a lot to grow if she really wants to stay in the long run of divas of today and maybe she will be adored much more.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Elton John's star was beginning to dim when he released A Single Man in 1978.  The album is a decent effort, but doesn't match up to his quintessential early 70's albums.  One big reason is that he severed his writing partnership with Bernie Taupin.  Together they created unforgettable songs, but apart, they've been hit and miss.  A Single Man falls into the hit and miss category.  Songs like \"Shine On Through\", \"Ego\", \"Part-Time Lover\" and the gorgeous and heartfelt \"Song For Guy\" (a tribute to his young messenger who was killed in a motorcycle accident) are quite good while others like \"Big Dipper\", \"Georgia\", \"Madness\" & \"Reverie\" fall short of the mark","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Alan Jackson will ultimately go down in country music history primarily for the music he made for Arista records, although we hope that he still has some great music to come, whichever label he signs for. The singles from his last Arista album of original recordings, the excellent Freight train, didn't do as well as those from his earlier albums. Initially, I wondered if American country radio stations were losing interest, but maybe Arista were switching their focus to younger artists. This compilation therefore becomes the last official compilation of Alan's Arista music. No doubt there will others in the years to come, but they will just recycle the material already released, together with whatever unreleased material lies in the Arista vaults.\n\nThe title implies that 34 of these 37 tracks were number one hits, but they weren't all number one of the American Billboard country charts. Most of the others came close, so maybe they were number ones on some other chart such as Cashbox (I don`t have access to Cashbox charts, so cannot check). Here in the real world (the title track of his first Arista album), didn't make number one on Billboard but was number one on the Canadian country chart, but all of Alan's other Canadian number ones were also number one on Billboard. Still, whether the title is accurate or not, it is fair to say that every track here is excellent.\n\nAs others have pointed out, some of Alan's hits that didn't make this compilation are also of a high quality. It would have been easy for Arista to compile a triple CD, but they probably struck the right balance in limiting this compilation to a double CD. Still, the absence of tracks such as Murder on Music Row (with George Strait), When somebody loves you (a top five country hit), I'll go on loving you (a top three country hit), Mercury blues (a number two country hit), Everything I love, Pop a top and others shows that Alan had plenty of great hits besides what you'll find here.\n\nThe three tracks not claimed as number ones ironically include one track that made it to number one on Billboard - As she's walking away, in which Alan joins the Zac Brown band. Ring of fire, a mellow cover of the old Johnny Cash classic, was a minor country hit when released as a single. The other new track, Look at me, may or may not have been released as a single, but it's a fine song.\n\nWhether or not there are 35 number one hits here doesn't matter; Alan had almost 50 top ten hits on the Billboard country charts, every one a gem, and some of those that didn't make the top ten (especially Murder on Music Row) are also regarded by many fans as classics. This collection provides a fitting tribute to Alan's 21 years of great music with Arista, whether this is your first Alan Jackson album or whether (like me) you have most of the tracks already.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Megadeth is one of the greatest thrash metal bands of all time. Their 15th album shows that even though Mustane is a guy who likes to think outside the box he always knows how to keep his massive fan-base happy. After another experiment with 'Supercolider' Megadeth returns after 3 years with their 15th studio album. 'Dystopia' is a return back to basic Megadeth. The heavy guitar and base rifts. Mustane's familiar growl and nothing but, a battle of words and politics. I am feeling at this point it's just 'meh'.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I appreciate that bands like this still make hard and rough albums like this and even some of the guitar work shows signs of the progressive sound of the previous album. After being one of the greatest and long lasting metal bands I kinda of feel that Megadeth, along with many other bands in the industry should finally pass the torch to the new blood. The album for me is a good listen but, just falls flat because it is the same thing that I have heard so many times over. I know the political views and this time around we obviously know who Megadeth is referring to as the enemy but, this is just not making the mark as strongly as it use to.\n\nAny Megadeth fan will be glad to own this album and I am one of them but, when you compare it to the legacy that this band has left behind...I feel that Dystopia will be the last Megadeth album I purchase because I feel they have done all that they can.","classification":3,"fold":1}

This is not a one hot wonder band, listen and you will find most of their songs are what your parents and older siblings were listening to.

{"text":"The cello has about a four octave range. This covers areas from that sung by bases to sopranos.  A good cellist and instrument can make the instrument sing in all of these octaves. There is a tremendous amount of cello music that is covered here. The music ranges from the baroque through the romantic period. I wish the documentation of the composers, dates, compositions, and performers was more robust but for many listeners that may not be critical. This collection gives you a chance to sample the large varieties of sounds a cello can make. This becomes even more interesting in more recent compositions. The performances range from adequate to excellent. I think I would advise a new listener to start off with the Dvorak cello concerto (Bands 3-5), the Tchaikovsky Rococo Variations (Band 13), or Brahms e-minor cello sonata(Bands 34-36).  If you are interested in learning the cello, it is a much easier instrument to get a good sound out of than the violin. The longer and lower pitched strings are much easier on the ears. You would be very surprised how quickly you can get a beautiful full sound out of a cello.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Multiple people in my life who have known me for a while know that I am a fan of multiple songs by Madonna and Angel by Madonna happens to be one of the one of a kind songs by her that I enjoy. Angel seems to be a spiritually healing music tune about meeting someone who has a blissful\/joyful influence on ones life. The lyrics of you came when I wished for you within the song indicates meeting someone in your life who seems to be almost sent from heaven in ones life. The lyrics just now I realize within part of the song seems to me to be a positive dedication mini story about noticing after getting to know the person how they are an angel. Fortunately for me, I consider my husband of 14 years an angel in my life and I am frequently reminded from his positive example on  how to have both a forgiving heart and a modest spirit. He is very modest on multiple things that I feel he deserves to give himself more value on yet that is something obviously for another post.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I just saw Frightened Rabbit in concert (more on that later). I was really into this band some 4-5 years ago (around the time of \"The Midnight Organ Fight\"), and then sorta lost track of these guys. After a long break following their 2010 album \"The Winter of Mixed Drinks\" now comes this new studio album.\n\n\"Pedestrian Verse\" (12 tracks; 42 min.) kicks off with a seemingly timid \"Acts of Men\", but then really charges hard with \"Backyard Skulls\" (2nd UK single). Next comes \"Holy\", which sounds it could be White Lies instead of Frightened Rabbit (and that's not a complaint). \"The Woodpile\" (1st UK single) is epic in scope, and jubilant. \"Late March, Death March\" contains several clever world plays. The second half of the album starts with a 1'30\" \"Housing (In)\" (later on we get an even shorter \"Housing (Out)\"). Highlights from the second half include \"State Hospital\" (which sounds like another single in the making), and the contemplative \"Nitrous Gas\", although the album closer \"The Oil Slick\" is quite good too. In all, this is a very nice return from the Scottish band.\n\nI saw Frightened Rabbit just this past weekend at the Laneway Festival at the Meadow Brook near Detroit. They played a mid-afternoon 45 min. set in the blazing sun, primarily bringing songs from this album, but with a couple of old nuggets as well (including a delocious \"My Backwards Walk\" from Midnight Organ Fight). Lead singer Scott Hutchison and his band mates gave it their all, much to the appreciation of the crowd. If you have a chance to see them live, do not miss them! Meanwhile, \"Pedestrian Verse\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Divine is hard to describe\nYou can experience it only\n\nWhat is the music of Russell Suereth like? It is a colorful carpet of bright melodies which completely draw your attention from the first moments. The artist masterfully combines various ethnical and western musical instruments creating a unique environment. And the vocal parts fit perfectly in the canvas of the album.\n\nWhen you are listening to Spiritual Haven you feel how all is well balanced here. The compositions of this album are created and arranged with perfectionism.\n\nThe music of Russell Suereth is full of life and power. It moves your body and awakes your mind. Probably, the main feature of Russell music is that when listening to it, you realize yourself as a spiritual being. You suddenly feel as if streams of energies flow through your body and fill your heart with joy and optimism. You start to believe in a better future because you sense the life totally. The music of Russell spins you into its whirlpool of pure and sparkling emotions.\n\nId also like to say a few words about the sounding of this album. It has been mastered by renowned Tom Eaton at Imaginary Road Studios therefore its sound is full of refinement and subtle nuances.\n\nThe music of Russell Suereth is very harmonious and Spiritual Haven will undoubtedly be interesting for a wide audience.

{"text":"It is very hard to believe but nearly 35 years since John Lennon was violently murdered, and the world lost a musical giant. His songs still stand taller on broad hearts and souls stronger than most of today's music. He had made some of the most brilliant music ever to come out of radio, they came from the heart. John had a lot of songs from the beginning to the end of his life all over that honestly had a lot to say from the soul. Woman is honestly one of those songs that I absolutely love of his career. It is truthfully one of those songs that really captures the soul so emotionally, and one of the last songs he had recorded before John passed on. It really says so much with a lot of meaning in the heart, and really worth the song each and every time you listen to it. If you have never heard a John Lennon song before, than I sincerely recommend you have Woman in your music library and the heart of John Lennon.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Released in 1983, Duck Rock has passed the test of time with flying colors. It's pure genius, a brilliant fusion of world and roots music, scratch and sampling techniques, dance beats, pop hooks and rock riffs. The mostly instrumental Obatala opens the album on a moody mid-tempo note; based on a drumming style from the Dominican Republic, the languid track has snippets of a female vocal far in the background. Legba is similarly atmospheric but based on Cuban beats and purely instrumental whilst Buffalo Gals is an expertly arranged feast of samples, scratching, percolating rhythms and solo & massed vocals.\n\nFour songs are inspired by and employ musicians from South Africa, three from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Zulu\/dp\/B000000DXI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Zulu<\/a>&nbsp;culture and from the Shangaan (Tsonga). They are (a) the uptempo Double Dutch, one of the catchiest numbers with African melody and instruments plus distinct types of backing vocals (b) the fascinating hybrid, Punk It Up, a song about&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Sex-Pistols\/dp\/B000002KIE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Sex Pistols<\/a>&nbsp;done in Zulu style with pennywhistles and gospelly backing vocals, sung in English and Zulu (c) the melodic Jive My Baby Jive with its great interplay of male and female vocals and hypnotic beat, whilst (d) the buoyant Living on the Road in Soweto is an example of Shangaan township music, a very popular style also present on Paul Simon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Graceland\/dp\/B0002EQ7E2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Graceland<\/a>.\n\nAnother one with a pronounced African influence is Song For Chango, made up of chanting and Afro-Cuban rhythms. The fast-paced and polyrhythmic Merengue takes the listener back to the Dominican Republic, and is vaguely reminiscent of some of the styles that&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Kid-Creole-The-Coconuts\/dp\/B0000DG028\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kid Creole & The Coconuts<\/a>&nbsp;experimented with. Duck Rock concludes with Duck for the Oyster, a vibrant finale based on the Appalachian square dance with inspired fiddle playing. What makes it all the more charming and cohesive is the voice of a DJ and the callers that give it the lively feel of a radio show.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/McLaren\/dp\/B0000026U5\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">McLaren<\/a>&nbsp;proves himself to be an excellent stylist on this innovative and well-produced album.

{"text":"What haven't I said that praises this incredible band? Dream Theater is one of the most skilled bands in the history of modern music. Every time I hear an album it's a whole new sound with a whole new atmosphere and for their 14th release we get something that this band should have brought its fans long ago. 'The Astonishing' is Dream Theater's first attempt at a rock opera. Following in the shadows of classics like The Who's 'Tommy' and Pink Floyd's 'The Wall'. 'The Astonishing' is Dream Theater's first double album since 2002's 'Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence' It is two hours of music that tells an epic story of the power of music and the saving of a far future Earth from takeover. A story with beautiful music and a cast of distinct characters that could have the ability to be viewed on a Broadway stage. However, as epic as this album is from a band that is perfect for the task there are a few short comings. With so many characters portrayed by the lead singer James Labrie and the legnth of the story there are points in time where the listener can get lost. Some songs are forgotten in the story due to many reprising sounds and one person playing all the characters. For a budget well spent and a band as brilliant as Dream Theater there could have been more efforts done to truly make this album their greatest. 'Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory managed to give us just that with less music and a single album.\n\nThis album is far from terrible and it is a very good listen, one of the best by far to start 2016. I am espeically happy that this album doesn't harp on the early 2000's dark and rough sound and is continuing to take shape and find its true identity in the post Portnoy era. I would say that a first time listener should look forwards other albums like Metropolis Pt. 2, Images and Words or even their previous self title. Still, while it is not perfect 'The Astonishing is a welcome edition to my collection.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"20 years ago, Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon delivered his solo debut \"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...\". At the time, the album was called nothing short of a masterpiece or a classic- and rightfully so. As Wu-Tang got bigger, so did their collective as well as their business opportunities. As such, Raekwon made an attempt to establish his own crew, The American Cream Team- a collective of producers and rappers. He made an effort to get things going on his sophomore album \"Immobilarity\" as well as the soundtrack to the James Toback ensemble cast film \"Black & White\". The problem was fans wanted another \"Cuban Linx 2\"- not helping matters was the production of \"Immobilarity\", which eschewed dusty soul for keyboard riffs and cheesy interpolations of pop songs (See: \"All That I Got Is You Part II\"'s swiping of Lionel Richie's \"Penny Lover\"). A few years passed when he released 2003's barely noticed \"The Lex Diamond Story\". After the release of that album, Raekwon was signed to Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment due to his association with fellow Aftermath signee Busta Rhymes, who was slated to executive produce his next record. \"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...Part II\" was originally scheduled for release in 2007, but kept getting delayed. Further troubling the project was Dr. Dre's lack of interest, coupled with the album's executive producer Busta Rhymes leaving the label over creative differences. After being in label limbo for a couple of years, Raekwon finally released the album in 2009 to critical acclaim- despite the album's obviously dated sound due to gestation.\n\nIn 2010, he teamed up with Ghostface Killah again for another album- however, this time around, they brought Method Man along for the ride for their lone album as a trio \"Wu-Massacre\". The following year, Raekwon emerged again for the underrated \"Shaolin Vs. Wu-Tang\". 20 years after the release of his debut, he released 2015's \"Fly International Luxurious Art\", a backronym for the late 80's fashion gear Fila. This time around, Raekwon is in a different place, as he is has now accumulated wealth and no longer involved in the crime life. To that end, the production on \"Fly International Luxurious Art\" is more radio friendly and happy- an unusual feat for a Raekwon album. Producers on the album include Strange Fruit Project member S1, Jerry \"Wonda\" Duplessis, Scoop DeVille and Scram Jones. Raekwon teams up with Ghostface Killah again for the songs \"4 In The Morning\" as well as the Rick Ross featured \"Revory (Wraith)\". He also duets with A$AP Rocky on \"I Got Money\" and gets help from French Montana and Busta Rhymes on the Stacy Lattisaw sampling \"Wall To Wall\". Raekwon interrupts the flow of the album with the dark narrative \"Live To Die\", while delivering the romantic Estelle featured \"All For You\". Two of the album's most interesting tracks are the melodic \"F.I.L.A. World\" featuring 2 Chainz and the club ready Snoop Dogg featured \"1 2, 1 2\". He closes the album with the atmospheric but moody \"Worst Enemy\" with vocals from The New Royales lead singer Liz Rodrigues. Despite the blatantly commercial overtones, \"Fly International Luxurious Art\" is actually a good album from Raekwon. While it may not win over some who are still attached to his earlier work, it's still a solid body of work from the Shaolin veteran.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Cher's new CD masters what \"Believe\" promised in 1998.  Cher's singing is confident and powerful; and the songs are consistently excellent.  This CD follows Cher's 2000 internet-only CD of self-penned tunes, \"not.commercial,\" that Cher released on her own Isis label.  For that CD, she lived in a castle in France and wrote some good songs like \"The Fall\" dedicated to Kurt Cobain and \"Sisters of Mercy\" that expressed her opinions on Catholic school.  While we don't see any saucy lyrics as Cher's classic, \"You're about as useless as Bob Dole's... arm,\" we do get the best commercial polish on \"Living Proof.\"\n\"Song for the Lonely\" is a hot rocker, timely in the wake of the World Trade Towers & Pentagon terrorist acts, \"When heroes fall in love or war, they live forever.\"  The drums fall hard on this comforting opener; and when Cher sings \"It'll be all right,\" her vocals fly angelically.  \"A Different Kind of Love Song\" is a cosmic rocker with a driving techno beat, \"We have living proof there's some kind of light that flows through everything.\"  \"Alive Again\" is a pulsating midtempo song of renewal, \"I only want to learn to freeze the flame.\"  Throbbing echo chamber vocals resound through the excellent \"The Music's No Good Without You.\"  One of my favorite tracks, #1 on my own personal top ten, is \"Rain Rain,\" an addictive soulful track.  Keyboards and hot rhythm guitar lace \"Real Love,\" \"Time after time, you're bringing me up when I'm down.\"  \"Love So High\" has more soaring vocals on this throbbing rocker.  \"Body to Body Heart to Heart\" is an amorous full-throated rocker where Cher uses a taste of Spanish guitar that she employed so prominently on one of my favorite songs from the \"not.commercial\" CD, the gorgeous ballad \"Still.\"  \"I'll never love this way again,\" Cher sings passionately as the pace slows a tad on the beautiful \"Love Is A Lonely Place Without You.\"  \"Love One Another\" is great cosmic pop with pulsing rhythms, \"Try to understand, open up your heart, a fist is just a hand, it can come apart.\"  Keyboards wash defiantly on \"When You Walk Away.\"  The CD closes with Bruce Roberts' and Donna Weiss' \"When the Money's Gone,\" a funky rocker that is so endearing.  Cher's voice floats as she sings, \"What a fine life I give to you.\"\n\"Living Proof\" is musically excellent.  Cher has fully moved into the genre.  We sense the woman behind the production.  She fashions some beautiful cosmic truths as well as just singing her heart out.  This CD is a VERY good time!  Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":1}

Don't know why it isn't more popular - I think some people look at the cover and think it isn't really a Rob Zombie album and it scares them away, seriously - why do I think that?  because the cover almost scared me away and I was like, \"This isn't Rob Zombie - or it's some different stuff he tried.\"  I seriously think it is the Black and White - non-cartoonish barebones cover.  And what an appropriate cover that reflects the music inside.  Zombie is great on this - it is DEFINITELY Rob Zombie-ish - but some of his best song-writing.  It is a moody album, with great lyrics and an angry depressed sound that I love.  It is just song after song that I love.  It IS barebones and moody - but great songs and they rock - great feel and aura.  I think it is some of his best work.  Like I say - it is a hidden gem.

{"text":"Christina Aguilera's interview with Lucky magazine was what first got me interested in checking out her recent work. My curiosity was also heightened when she mentioned that anyone that likes the song \"Fighter\" is also going to like her new work and when Blake Shelton publicly endorsed her latest cd (via facebook).  I consider both Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert naturally good singers. Naturally,I figured that \"Lotus\" must contain good vocals as well.  I am glad that I went by this hunch because Christina Aguilera's voice definitely shines through on this deluxe version.  I understand that others may prefer different songs, but these tracks are currently among some of my favorites on \"Lotus\": \"Army Of Me\", \"Red Hot Kinda Love\" \"Make The World Move\" (featuring Ceelo), \"Your Body\", \"Let There Be Love\", \"Around The World\", \"Best Of Me\", \"Just A Fool\" (featuring Blake Shelton), and \"Light Up The Sky\".\n\"Lotus\" by Christina Aguilera is definitely recommended for those who enjoy \"Fighter\" and\/or at least three songs by Christina Aguilera.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"\"Versus\" is a 9 track EP by Usher, released about 5 months after his million selling \"Raymond VS Raymond\". Along with the sensual ballad \"There goes my baby\" (originally from Raymond VS Raymond\") and a remix of Justin Bieber's rather cheesy upbeat Dance\/Pop \"Somebody to love\", there are 7 new songs.\n\nLeading the new songs is Usher's current US top 10 hit \"DJ got us falling in love\", a Techno-ish Dance number (with a perfunctory rap by Pitbull) in the vein of his recent US & UK #1 \"OMG\". Other standouts are \"Hot tottie\" which features Jay-Z and is skeletal with a booming bassline, \"Lingerie\" which is an upbeat Michael Jackson-channeling R&B number produced by Jam & Lewis, and the ballad \"Stranger\" with swirling synths which is similar to songs like \"Burn\" or \"Moving mountains\".\n\nThe other 3 songs are rather throwaway though, which is a shame as it seems just as he is stepping out of his comfort zone and trying something new, he rushes back to the safety of bland generic R&B sounds. 3 and a half stars.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Someone pointed out my first review of this album was rambling, I agree - so I've shortened it : ). I've read many of the one star reviews and I just don't get it?  Pink Floyd made it very clear this was an instrumental album with one vocal track.  For me - I love when Pink Floyd just does instrumentals.  This CD is all I expected but I still want more.  To say this is their last, well - I hope both David and Nick reconsider.  I've already read Nick hints there may be something more - I hope so.  There is no reason to stop when you are masters at your craft and the chemistry still produces life changing music.\n\nTurn off the lights, light candles, turn on Christmas lights, or whatever you do to prepare for the ritual of listening to a Pink Floyd CD.  This CD I believe is a gem.  I would hate this to be their last.  It makes you want to take a long walk into nature or watch the stars at night.  This CD makes me want to take an adventure and have this the soundtrack.  I hope this is not the end.\n\nI am a musician and realize many things take multiple listens, so don't give up on the first few listens - although I was hooked from the first one. It's wonderful to hear more Pink Floyd after 20 years silent.\n\nI give this CD a SUPER SOLID 4 star rating - for some it may take more time to see than others. In my humble opinion, Pink Floyd should not end - because we all know they can do what no other band can do.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Numb by Abica was a hard album for me to review. The band sent me a promo CD and I've listened to it a number of times trying to figure out how a feel about it. It isn't a style I normally listen to, so I want to be as objective as possible. The music doesn't want you to be objective though. It wants you to feel and get deep down into it.\n\nIf forced to classify it, rap-rock with and industrial influence is as close as I can come. I think Tac and Hash are really trying to something unique here. In some instances they succeed wonderfully while in others they fall back in to cliche. Their rap interplay works well yet their singing voices leave a little to be desired. The big strength of Numb is its the lyrics. Very well thought out, you really get into their heads. These songs are brimming with emotion, though I'd say the predominant one is angst. The F-bomb gets dropped frequently, but it only serves to emphasize the more meaningful lyrics.\n\nMusically I really dig most of Abica's songs. There are some very cool things going on in the songs and repeat listens are needed to pick out some of the more subtle stuff. I'd compare them to Trent Reznor, but their studio wizardry isn't quite to that level. Yet. It is well on it's way and very listenable. I'd just like to hear a bit more dynamic range and a slightly less \"processed\" sound. While Abica covers a wide range of topics and a few different styles, in the end it one song comes out sounding a bit like the next. But if you want strong beats, emotionally driven lyrics and catchy hooks, then maybe that isn't such a bad thing. It has grown on me and I am willing to bet that album #2 takes things to the next level.\n\nStandouts for me:\n\nWhat You See\nNumb\nMy Song\nBlurry\nThe Things You Think I Say\nTake This Away\nNever That Far Away\nNothing Here\nBeautiful\nGave Em A Reason","classification":4,"fold":1}

And regardless of what some may claim, this is traditional Christmas music, but not in the sense of 1950-1970s, but past centuries.  I'm not sure what some people were expecting.  Maybe Justin Beiber's Christmas album or something.  I must admit that the contratenor stuff just doesn't work for me, but no matter there is still a huge number of selections that do.  At first I wasn't too excited about having yet another set of Handel's Messiah since MOTAB did a great job on it in the 50s, but I figured I'd give it a quick listen.  And to my astonishment I hear a HARPSICHORD!  What a pleasant surprise.

{"text":"I bought this CD pretty much on a whim after I had heard her single, \"Everything\". Let me say that I didn't like her much at all when her first single \"Take Me Away\" was out. I'm glad I changed my mind because this is pop\/punk slash pop\/rock at its greatest. Some songs are catchy while others just have good lyrics. Some songs have both like one of my favorites \"Unforgiven\". It's about how Fefe's dad wasn't around for anything in her life. I didn't like this song too much before because of the in-your-face approach but it has since warmed up to me.\n\nThe highlights are: \"Stupid Little Love Song\", \"We Went For A Ride\" \"Kiss Me Fool\" \"Revolution Song\" and the saucy \"Give It Up\".\n\nIf you are a pop fan like me, you will probably like this. If you see it somewhere for about 10 bucks, I'd say you've spent your money well.\n\nBtw, this girl blows Avril Lavigne out of the water completely! I heard that her record company didn't want to release her second CD, Sunday Love for some reason, but I also think she's working on finding another label. I hope she picks a good one and continues making good music! I'll certainly be looking out for her!!","classification":4,"fold":1}

Some of Leona's songs work (Bleeding Love, Better In Time, Brave, I Will Be, her cover of The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face) and some of them don't. This one does. It feels like you are at a party when listening to this track. I heard it before when listening to her tracks for her second album on Youtube a few years back but then I recently heard this song again on Last.fm radio and was really, really hooked. I like fell in love with her all over again.\n\nLeona kind of frustrates me sometimes though. She's got the beauty, the talent and the vocal chops but some of her material is boring. I think she could be really, really big if she brought most of her material home on a really, really good album. I heard most of her first album and her whole second album and liked songs on both, but wasn't sold as a whole on either. But I believe in her potential. She's just gotta dig a bit deeper.\n\n4 stars.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"It seems like I have been waiting forever for this album after the band's stunning debut. I am a 65 year old former drummer and every once in a while a band comes along where I just feel so in tune with the groove of the band that I wish I could be part of their creative process. That is definitely the case here. When I reviewed Laura Marling's \"Short Movie,\" I said it was, in my opinion, the best album of the first quarter of 2015. Someone is going to release something spectacular to steal that rating for the second quarter. Make no  mistake, this is a great album by a great band. The variety of genres, rhythms, arrangements, tempos, and vocal stylings keep the listener rapt with attention.\nAfter the relatively mellow and soothing title track opens the album, a funky musical intro takes us to a very primal squeal from Brittany Howard, the group's main vocalist. This squeal tells you that you are entering very special, privileged, intimate territory. While it would be easy to describe the band as a \"soul\" band, or an \"R & B\" band, but that would be so misleading.\nThese people can PLAY! They take the listener through amazing tempos, time signature switches, and other sophisticated musical mastery that just sets them far above most other small groups playing today.\nIn addition, the lyrics are great, and it is sort of a battle to focus on the words or the music. They even take the listener into some very intimate, even psychedelic grooves. I really couldn't name any one song as a standout, because that word really applies to the entire effort. It is hard to believe that this is only their second release. They have earned a place on my daily playlist, yet I can't help wondering where their collective chemistry and talent will take us in the future. Highest recommendation.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"The songs in this album \"Reflections of Rosemary\" from \"Blue Skies\" and  \"Mood Indigo\" to \"In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning\" and \"Time After Time\" are some of the nicest popular standards identified with Rosemary Clooney, one of the best female vocalists of all-time. And Debby Boone is singing the same songs as her special tribute to her mother-in-law. This album promises the listeners an unforgettably, wholesomely beautiful listening experience. There is something to captivate the ears of every listener as she is backed by some of the best musicians we have in the music world today: Rosemary Clooney's arranger\/pianist for twenty years, John Oddo, arranger Earl Brown, guitarists John Pizzarelli and Jim Fox, bassist Chuck Berghofer, drummer Gregg Field, percussionist Daniel Greco, saxophonists Gary Foster, Dan Higgins and Scott Hamilton, trumpeter Warren Luening and cellist Armen Ksajikian.\n\nI have enjoyed the music of Debby Boone since she recorded an album of great inspirational songs in the seventies and eighties most notably \"Sweet Adoration,\" \"Can You Reach My Friend?\" \"Sincerely Yours\" and \"You Light Up My Life.\" Her father's music, Pat Boone, has been part of my very musical family when I was growing up. He was one of my late parents' favorite singers and mine, too and I was especially fond of his hit song, \"Love Letters In The Sand.\"\n\nOn this elegantly charming tribute album recorded with love and dedication,  Debby Boone sings sixteen classic standards starting off with an uplifting  Irving Berlin classic, \"Blue Skies,\" which Rosemary Clooney used to sing to her first grandson Jordan, whenever he was \"sad, when he took a fall and was crying, or anytime he needed his spirits lifted.\" It's a surprised added track - Ms. Clooney's A Capella version. Ms. Boone stated that, like her son Jordan, she would always find comfort in this beautiful song, which highlights Scott Hamilton on tenor sax solo.\n\nWhile all the tracks are so enjoyable, I really love the way she sang \"Mood Indigo,\" which features a vocal quartet - herself and her sisters Cheryl, Lindy and Laury with vocal chart arrangement written by Earl Brown. With its vintage-sounding arrangement and its nostalgic rendition, this classic from Duke Ellington\/Barney Bigard\/Irving Mills evokes a sentimental feeling that will flood your eyes with an ocean of tears as the sisters sing...\n\nLittle sister, you ain't been blue\nNo, no, no\nYou ain't been blue\nNot till you've had that mood indigo\nThat feelin' goes stealin' down to your shoes\nThen you cry, you just sit there and cry\nGo long, so long blues...\n\nAlways get that mood indigo\nSince my baby said goodbye\nIn the evenin' when lights are low\nI'm so lonesome I could cry\n\nThe wonderful tone of John Pizzarrelli's guitar as well as his soft and mellow scat can be heard in \"I've Grown Accustomed To His Face\" while Dan Higgin's flute plays beautifully in \"It Might As Well Be Spring\" complementing Ms. Boone's gorgeous vocals. The Van Heusen\/Burke medley is also surprisingly stunning \"But Beautiful,\" \"Moonlight Becomes You\" and \"Like Someone In Love.\" One of my all-time favorites \"The Music That Makes Me Dance\" by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill was rendered so beautiful and heartfelt making it one of the best interpretations ever recorded. And she dedicated it to her hubby, Gabri. The delicate medley of \"It Never Entered My Mind\" and \"In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning\" was selected as a tribute to Frank Sinatra, whom Ms. Boone had worked with on several occasions in the past. The enchanting Bossa Nova arrangement on \"The Best Is Yet To Come\" is so pleasing to the ears.\n\nAn all-time top favorite, Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne's \"Time After Time\" is also a highlight and one of the singer's favorite songs that Chet Baker recorded in an album called \"Chet Baker Sings.\" According to her, \"she fell in love with that album in 1996 and developed a real school girl's crush on Chet. She spent summer tirelessly delighting in his trumpet playing and melting at the sound of his voice, not to mention his picture.\" She then sent a copy of the record to Rosemary knowing that she would absolutely \"love the way this guy sang.\" And to her surprise, Rosemary told her; \"Do you know I carry around a picture of Chet Baker in my wallet to this day?\" In other words, they had a crush on the same guy! Co-incidentally,  \"Chet Baker Sings\" is also my very first Chet Baker CD from my collection and I have written a review on this outstanding album about a year ago. It's a very nice album that focuses on Chet Baker not as a trumpet player but as a singer with a soft and mellow vocal style.\n\nListen to Debby Boone at her utmost best as she pays homage to one of the best female singers of all-time, Rosemary Clooney. You'll also be delighted with the Liner Notes, which include in great detail Ms. Boone's heartfelt sentiments for each and every song she selected for this great tribute album.\n\nAn album of sheer beauty, elegance and perfection.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"In 2003, Sufjan Stevens claimed to have begun a project where he would write one album for each of the fifty states. This lasted for two brilliant records before Stevens admitted it was more of a marketing ploy than a realistic goal. Michigan and Illinois received the royal treatment while the remaining forty-eight states are left to wonder \"what if.\" Now, five years after Illinoise hit the shelves, Sufjan Stevens has finally taken a break from Christmas songs and audio\/visual experiments to release another more customary pop record, or has he?\n\nThe Age of Adz opens with \"Futile Devices,\" a familiarly calm track with a simple, yet effective instrumentation and Stevens' wistful vocals. Fans may rejoice at this newest addition to Stevens' collection of beautiful melodies, but it doesn't take long to learn these celebrations are premature. Stevens' increasingly experimental tendencies quickly take over.\n\nNearly halfway through The Age of Adz, on the track \"Now That I'm Older,\" Stevens carefully places the line \"it's different now, I think.\" This is certainly the case with Stevens' newest release, and it's a realization that hits listeners instantaneously as the second track, \"Too Much,\" begins. Sounding like a mixture of Radiohead's Kid A and Flaming Lips' Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, Stevens quickly dives into electronic, syncopated rhythms, expanding his instrumentation to incorporate strings, horns and a host of other sound effects and synthesized notes.\n\nThe title track, \"The Age of Adz,\" follows \"Too Much\" with a similar beep transition to Radiohead's move from \"Airbag\" to \"Paranoid Android\" on OK Computer. Like that album, The Age of Adz uses this passage as an introduction to the most complex and monumental track on the record. Sufjan Stevens' vocals uncharacteristically waver in pitch, but they fit the music perfectly. Complete with a bombastic orchestration, Stevens shows off what he is truly capable of musically and further distances himself from his previous sound as the album continues on.\n\nWith the exception of the drawn out, twenty-five minute final track, \"Impossible Soul,\" that delves into the world of Auto-tune, Sufjan Stevens' new sound is almost shockingly successful. Fans hoping for a continuation of his state albums project may have a hard time grasping the complex melodies of The Age of Adz, but those listeners patient enough to give the new sound a chance will learn Sufjan Stevens has plenty left to offer.\n\nSimilar Artists: Radiohead, Animal Collective\n\nTrack Suggestion: \"The Age of Adz\"","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Our friends electric\n\nMagical subconscious musings from the master. Only one letter separates Numan from Human; and this is how I remember that this artist was the forerunner for all those who have made machine music human. In the early days, listeners had trouble with the synths role in rock. What was this new machine entering the stage? Numan deftly blended the best of punk, rock, blues, and soul into the format of electronic music. He always understood that the best combination was synthplusguitarplusbassplusdrumsplusinnovativevocals.\n\nAs the years progressed, he fleshed out the rich lyrical landscapes available to those willing to push the boundaries of modern music and go fearlessly into uncharted territories. Numan has always been one step ahead, though proudly wearing his influences on his sleeve (usually ones that he, in turn, influenced). When we were all dancing to New Wave back in the eighties, little did we know that New Wave could have such powerful ripples on generations of musicians. Here we are, its 2014, and friends are indeed electric! (RIP Philip K. Dick)\n\nThis latest work continues in the vein he has explored for the past decade that hums delicately in my brain like the darkest, but most sumptuous, of worldly and subconscious mind explorations. Like the Jung and Freud of the rock medium, Gary Numan takes the listener on profound mystical explorations\/journeys that prove cathartic. Like the darkest of blues coalesced with those titillating vibrations of world music, ala Dead Can Dance, the listener is first challenged to sink his mind deep into the reservoir and then  after a deeply enriching experience of sound and lyrics  emerge gloriously into another state of being.\n\nIts music that re-orients and re-calibrates the human nervous system according to the instructions of manufacturers previously unseen and unrealized.\n\nYou absolutely must see this performance live!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I have followed Christina Aguilera's career since she first hit the radio in the late 90's and everything she's done since then has been a true measure of talent, rather than just a reliance on auto-tune and catchy pop beats. I lost interest in her career after her album \"Bionic\" was a disappointment.\n\nI picked up this album when it was on sale for $1.99 and I was willing to take a chance on it after hearing \"Just A Fool\". I'm so glad I got this album! The first song, \"Lotus Intro\" is ethereal and empowering all at once, and Christina's strong vocals take a backseat to her honest lyrics about leaving pain and loss behind to release her beautiful, artful soul. This album isn't just about trials and tribulations, though it does touch on it without feeling too heavy.\n\n\"Lotus\" has a collection of fun pop songs that make you want to move and sing along. Her melodies rival the best pop songs on the radio right now and I'd much prefer to hear her music on the airwaves other than Lady Gaga or Katy Perry. I wouldn't change anything about this album, it's a perfect composition; fun, ethereal, honest, and artful. Christina's voice is just getting better and she experiments with it on this album. Sometimes, it's soft and understated, other times, it's a force of nature.\n\nI highly recommend this album to new and old fans alike. You won't be disappointed!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Bob Baldwin is one of the hardest working jazz musicians in the business. In addition to his musical creations, he's also has a hand in organizing a music festival in Westchester County (NY). He's also had some bad luck in regards to record labels. The last CD he released with his previous label, A440 Music Group was a critical success. However, the company suffered from a  cash flow problem to promote his and other artists CD's and declared bankruptcy last year. Baldwin has since signed on with 215 Records out of Philadelphia for his latest release, \"All in a Day's Work\".  For those who are not familiar with Baldwin, just think of Alex Bugnon with soul.  His style is smooth, very hip.  His music sounds very much like New York.  it has an urban style that is sophisticated and classy.  I thought that sound was clear with the title track as well as the song, \"Steamy\".  They were clearly the best tracks on the CD.  I was very thrilled by his release.  He'll be in our play list for sometime.  It's an outstanding piece of work.","classification":5,"fold":1}

There is some nice synthesizer throughout with some contrasting drum rhythms here and there with a solid bass line. The lyrics are unobtrusive. A classic Cars tune.","classification":5,"fold":1}

They include&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Little-Big-Box-Bach-Orchestral-Music\/dp\/B00KS0ASOU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Little Big Box :: Bach Orchestral Music<\/a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Handel-Oratorio-Box\/dp\/B00KICWEN6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Handel Oratorio Box<\/a>, and others. So far, I have found each of them a delightful listening experience.\n\nI recently added Big Beethoven Box to my digital library. This is the first of two Big Box albums featuring the works of Ludwig van Beethoven (the other being&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Bigger-Beethoven-Box\/dp\/B01BHELQD2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bigger Beethoven Box<\/a>, which I have previously reviewed), and it is very good. It contains a wide selection of Beethovens compositions, including piano sonatas, cello sonatas, string quartets, three of his nine symphonies, incidental music for The Creatures of Prometheus and Egmont, as well as piano variations, minuets, sonatinas, overtures, rondos, and other works. All are performed with a high degree of artistry by a variety of world-class, but lesser known musicians.\n\nAlthough I think Big Beethoven Box it is very good, and certainly upholds the high standards of the other Big Box sets I own, I do have two minor reservations about it:\n\n1. There are no piano trios on \"Big Beethoven Box.\" Some of my favorite Beethoven chamber music masterpieces  especially his Archduke and Ghost trios  belong to this sub-genre, and I think the fact that none of them are included makes this a less comprehensive and well-rounded album.\n\n2. The albums engineering does not quite rise to the level of the best Big Box albums  especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Mozart-Box\/dp\/B00B5Q7M90\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Mozart Box<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Haydn-Box\/dp\/B00CMAM8QA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Haydn Box<\/a>. On most tracks, the sound is bright, clear, and well-balanced, but on a few others, the audio quality seems murky to my ears, and individual instruments are sometimes difficult for me to hear.  There are also a few technical glitches to the album that require manual editing of individual tracks metadata. (See reviewer Upstate Listeners excellent review for tips on how to fix these problems.)\n\nDespite my concerns about Bigger Beethoven Box, I still think it is a very good sampler of Ludwig van Beethovens music. With first-rate performances by world-class musicians, its (for the most part) excellent audio quality, and its low price of 99 cents, it makes for an overall highly rewarding listening experience. Highly recommended.  (4 Stars ^ 5)","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Ok...here I go...I have to comment on the review of \"A lover of Mew\" (poor Mew), from July 22, 2000. He compares the Boyz as being on a par with Celine Dion, Andrea Bocelli, Sade, and Kenny G. Oh come on, the first 3, of course not, they are completely different, and terrific in their own genres...but Kenny G, DOH! I think the Boyz would give up singing if they ever heard that one. Comparing Boyz 2 Men to Kenny G is like comparing silk to polyester, prime rib to hamburger, Belgian chocolates to dog chocolates and champagne to grape juice. Come on Mew! Hey, maybe there's a reason why, in your \"About Me\" section, you give yourself the nickname of \"The Jerk\".\nOk, now I have that out, I shall get back to the album. These guys are a talented foursome from Philly. Their vocal harmonies are of the best Motown tradition, but given a modern touch and are second to none. \"I'll make love to you\" is one of the most romantic songs ever, but we've come to expect great songs like that from Babyface. The Boyz also wrote quite a few of their own songs that are featured on this album,  which further showcases their talents. This album is a must for all R&B fans.","classification":5,"fold":1}

With following-up to All I Ever Wanted, Kelly has had a strong gamble to make it worth while, but falls into fair territory with Mr. Know It All, the lead single from her 5th album Stronger, It is nothing to honestly rave about, and isn't really is driven as her harder songs had shown like Behind These Hazel Eyes, and Ms. Independent. Overall, I think Kelly Clarkson needs to find better strides in her music, than sing the same old thing again and again, musically.

{"text":"My goodness, where has the time gone?  I can remember buying Beach Boys singles in the mid 1960's for .68 each at a downtown record store or \"on sale\" for .48 at one of those new-fangled discount department stores.  What was especially cool about grabbing the latest Beach Boys 45 rpm record was that more often than not Capitol Records shipped them in colorful picture sleeves.  Although these sleeves would become treasured collector's items for many what most of the kids were really interested in was the music.  The sound of The Beach Boys has proven to be timeless and as evidenced by their highly successful 2012 album \"That's Why God Made The Radio\" they are still getting the job done.  As a tribute to 50 years in the music business Capitol Records has released an exciting two-disc anthology \"The Beach Boys Greatest Hits:  50 Big Ones\" featuring the biggest hits and most acclaimed songs from their remarkable five decade career.  For those in the Baby Boom generation this one truly qualifies as \"the soundtrack of your life\".\n\n\"The Beach Boys Greatest Hits:  50 Big Ones\" features all of those dynamic hit singles from the 1960's presented exactly as you would remember them when they were blasting from your car radio or perhaps from that little transistor radio you smuggled into bed late at night when you were a young teen.  Enjoy once again great Top Ten hits like \"Fun, Fun, Fun\",  \"Help Me, Rhonda\", \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and one of their most popular tunes of all-time \"Surfer Girl\" from the summer of '63.  Gee, I feel like a kid again!  The hit singles just kept on coming with songs like \"Barbara Ann\", \"I Get Around\", \"When I Grow Up (To Be A Man)\", and the all-time favorite \"California Girls\" which are all included here as well.  Heck there are also a number of extremely popular \"flip sides\" in this collection including timeless tunes like \"In My Room\", \"Don't Worry Baby\" and most especially \"God Only Knows\" which as I recall was released as a \"B\" side partly out of fear that radio stations would refuse to play a song with \"God\" in the title.  Despite all his success Brian Wilson was never one to rest on his laurels.  He was constantly experimenting with new and different sounds and in the fall of 1966 he unveiled his masterpiece \"Good Vibrations\" which is generally considered to be one of the greatest singles ever recorded in the rock and roll era.  It was becoming clear that in the not too distant future The Beach Boys would be heading off in new musical directions and into uncharted waters.\n\nIn late 1969 The Beach Boys would leave the cozy confines of Capitol and signed with Reprise Records.  The group was definitely ahead of the curve.  The Top 40 format was just beginning to wane and Album Oriented Radio (AOR) would break out in the not-too-distant future.  Tastes were changing and at this point in their career The Beach Boys were more interested in recording albums and doing concerts.  Over the next several years they would release a series of critically acclaimed LP's including \"Sunflower\", \"Surf's Up\" and \"Holland\" to name but a few.  \"50 Big Ones\" offers up 8 terrific tracks from these memorable albums including the hit singles \"Rock and Roll Music\", \"Sail On, Sailor\" and \"It's OK\" as well as my all-time favorite Beach Boys tune \"Add Some Music To Your Day\" from the aforementioned \"Sunflower\".  If you have never heard this one check it out!\n\nIn the decades that followed The Beach Boys would continue to record sporadically.  In 1988 they had one of their biggest singles ever with \"Kokomo\" from the motion picture \"Cocktail\" which went all the way to #1.  Earlier this year the group got together once again to record a new studio album and embark on a 50th Anniversary tour.  The title song of that album \"That's Why God Made The Radio\" is included in this collection as is a new single version of \"Isn't It Time\".  I can tell you that a lot of thought and a great deal of care went into this project.  As a collector I really appreciated the extensive liner notes and the 7 postcards that have been included are really a blast.  Meanwhile, I found the sound quality to be outstanding.  I suspect that \"The Beach Boys Greatest Hits:  50 Big Ones\" will turn up under a lot of Christmas trees this December 25th.  Trust me, it would make a great gift for that Baby Boomer in your life.  Long live The Beach Boys!  Very highly recommended!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"When I was listening to this album after downloading it earlier due to a rain delay for a race on tv, I didn't realize how good this is. the way the group writes songs reminds me much of another Christian group I used to really love 4HIM. They really reach to a biblical root in their lyrics. My favorite line is in one of the songs 'Only when I put you first and stand on your word can I be fearless or something like that. If I'm wrong correct me. Something that I thought disapeared from Christian music was good solid lyrics and music. This group of guys seems to pack that together nicely and put a nice soul groove in their music. if you love Dara Maclean, or 4HIM and wondered if strong songwriting was a anomaly in Christian Music, you should check Unspoken out. I personally loved 4HIM up to their disbanding and I'm surprised its taken this long to find a group that I like that much. Okay nothing will beat 4HIM, but Unspoken will be up there close to them as my favorite Christian band and also Casting Crowns.","classification":5,"fold":1}
{"text":"I bought this CD on a whim which I normally NEVER do. I usually stick to music by artists I already know and love and even then I tend to buy just the greatest hits type albums. I've learned over the years that buying CDs is a waste of money - Typically there are two or three songs you really love and want to listen to and the rest are garbage. (There's a reason the majority of those songs are never released on the radio!) However, I listened to the song samples several times and of course had heard \"Pray for You\" on the radio and I was intrigued. That... and his name drew me in. I've never come across anyone else with my name before, even spelled differently. :) Jaron has one of those voices that sinks into your head and sort of settles in. Like a soft cat on a warm sofa cushion - he sinks in and isn't leaving anytime soon. I'm not sure I would call this country music at all - it's not pop either or even jazz. More like a gumbo of all those genres cooked together in a delicious stew that I will enjoy time and time again.

She thanks the Dear Lord in the CD notes for her instrument, her voice, and you will too.  Headly started at the top of her talent and has done the impossible, gotten better.  The title track draws you in and the rest of the songs make listening a pleasure.  Hear the confidence in the cover of \"River Deep, Mountain High\", an iconic and difficult to sing rock classic closely associated with several other memorable singers.  Headley completely owns the song in her version; no easy task.\n\nListening to the CD in it's entirety instead of a song-at-a-time enhances the joys of \"The Only One in the World\", which is nicely  sequenced.\n\nWhen she returns to Broadway in yet another seeingly inevitable film-to-stage adaptation in a role previously associated with Whitney Houston, I'm sure she'll blow audiences away (again!)  It takes confidence to know you can step into an iconic part and make it your own.  There's good reason for that confidence with Heather Hedley.

{"text":"The mid-to-late Sixties was a strange and difficult time for many Blues men - most were without contracts, forgotten and under-appreciated. Then the Blues boom happened (particularly in the UK) and many had their careers kick-started all over again.\n\nFreddie King was no exception. His last album had been for Federal in 1964, but with a new lease of life on the mighty Atlantic label, he produced two much revered LPs in rapid succession. The first was \"Freddie King Is A Blues Master\" released in 1969 on SD 9004 - and then this peach - \"My Feeling For The Blues\" on Cotillion SD 9016 released in early 1970.\n\nThis 1991 Repertoire CD (REP 4170-WZ) is a straightforward transfer of that second 11-track album (36:03 minutes).\n\nAce saxophonist KING CURTIS produced the record - with all arrangements by Atlantic's newest soul protg DONNY HATHAWAY (except \"Woke Up This Morning\" which was Arranged by King Curtis).\n\nThe musicians for the sessions were:\nLead Guitar & Vocals - FREDDIE KING\nRhythm Guitar - CORNELL DUPREE\nTenor Saxophones - GEORGE COLEMAN and FRANK WESS\nTenor & Baritone Saxophones - TREVOR LAWRENCE and WILLE BRIDGES\nTrumpets - ERNIE ROYAL and MARTIN BANKS\nPiano - GEORGE STUBBS\nBass - JERRY JEMMOTT\nDrums - KEVIN RICE\n\"What'd I Say\" features Bass Marimba and Sax Solo by KING CURTIS\n\"You Don't Have To Go\" and \"The Things I Used To Do\" feature Harmonica by HUGH McCRACKEN\n\nThe 3-way foldout inlay has a brief but informative history of King's career by BERND MATHEJA that is sided on Page 3 by a selected Discography. Although licensed from East West, it doesn't advise who remastered what - but the sound quality is great nonetheless - clean, muscular and so enjoyable. Repertoire as a label has always had a good reputation when it comes to transfers.\n\nSide 1 opens with the down and dirty \"Yonder Wall\" which not surprisingly for the date it was recorded name-checks men coming home from the Vietnam War. It's followed by a cracking Freddie King instrumental called \"The Stumble\" - the kind of cool boppin' blues tune that turns up on those hip compilations you read about. \"I Wonder Why\" and \"Stormy Monday\" (BB King and Jimmy Witherspoon covers) get the brassy treatment like \"Yonder Wall\" to great effect, while Side 1 ends with a wonderful take on Willie Mabon's \"I Don't Know\" with the bass really forward and funky in the mix.\n\nSide 2 opens with a version of Ray Charles' \"What'd I Say\" that builds like the Atlantic original did, which is followed by one of my favourites, a fabulous soulful take on Jimmy Witherspoon's standard \"Ain't Nobody's Business What We Do\" (lyrics above). It's followed by a superb harmonica driven shuffle, a cover of Jimmy Reed's \"You Don't Have To Go\" which features Freddie giving it some funky blues - such a cool number.  The pace is then expertly changed to another \"...my baby is gone...\" song, a cover of B.B. King's \"Woke Up This Morning\" with punchy brass fills (you can so hear Hathaway's soulfulness in a lot of the arrangements).\n\nThis album has been reissued subsequently in 2008 by another company but apparently the sound isn't the greatest; the only other stop is the July 2009 Bear Family Box Set called \"Taking Care Of Business\" that covers everything from 1956 through to 1973 across 7 CDs and a Hardback Book - a Christmas treat I feel certain I'm going to allow myself.\n\nBorn in 1934, Freddie King suffered a heart attack whilst playing a Christmas concert in 1976 and passed away in hospital two days later. Name-checked by luminaries such as Eric Clapton and Peter Green, on hearing this totally forgotten peach of an album, it's easy to see why this bluesman is remembered with such affection.\n\nA nice CD and worth seeking out - next stop the bank-manager and Bear Family's stupendous box set...","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I first bought the soundtrack back in the 60s, with 14 tracks.  This edition is an \"expanded edition,\" with 18 tracks. More is better, right? Not necessarily. I prefer the original order of tracks with the expanded Carousel Waltz (7 min.) opening the record in place of this version, that starts with the audio opening of the picture (2 min.), with Gordon MacRae and the \"starkeeper.\" It is unnecessary, especially considering that this musical is considered by most (including me) as the best Rodgers & Hammerstein score, but a less-than-ideal story (based on the depressing \"Lilliom\"). Track two is the abbreviated Carousel Waltz (under 2 min.), that played during opening credits (the full Waltz is played at the end). Two ballet sequences are added, June is Bustin' Out All Over Ballet, and \"Ballet,\" the sequence with Louise (Billie and Julie's teenage daughter). The \"June\" ballet is interesting but is marred by the sounds of the chorus' shoes on the stage floor during the dance! It was obviously just lifted from the film soundtrack. The latter \"Ballet\" is actually a nice addition, with a varied version of the Carousel Waltz, with a calliope effect making it sound like a real carousel; very atmospheric. It ends with the \"shame on you!\" dialogue of taunts from Julie's classmates.  I own the original soundtrack (Angel\/Musical Heritage Society) on CD preserving the original LP sequence. I was going to purchase this \"expanded edition\" but changed my mind and just downloaded the two ballets.\nThis is in my mind Rodgers & Hammerstein's finest score, and the film soundtrack is the best version out there with Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRae along with Barbara Ruick, Robert Rounseville,in the lead roles, and Claramae Turner (\"When you walk through a storm\"), all professionally trained singers, very unusual in movie versions of musicals, which often prefer marquee movie stars over singers.\nDespite my minor criticism of some of the tracks or their order, this is still a \"must-buy\" CD for lovers of classic Broadway theatre.","classification":5,"fold":1}

What sold me was the Hall & Oates songs that I like very much, and the result is good -- I'm going to go find some of their other albums.\n\nInara George's vocals are sultry and sexy, with lots of depth created with overdubbing. She's consistently good across all the tracks. Greg Kurstin's backgrounds are sort of Euro-pop-ish. The treatment fits, and the results are excellent for me, an original Hall & Oates fan.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"When you are in love, you can feel this song 5 fold. If you're not in love, but a dreamer like me, then you aren't left out.\n\nAlicia picked a good single. Making it her first, to me, at first wasn't the smartest because this was not the song that impacted me on the first listen. The keyboard (or organ) in it is fantastic but it just wasn't what we were used to with her...it was really different. And the video was kinda too.\n\nBut the more I listened to it, the more I fell in love with the song! Her voice was (and still is!) very, very heartfelt. It starts out with your basic piano arrangement; pretty; lulling; uncomplicated. Then comes in the \"organ\" and it's nice; fitting. But you continue on, hear the chorus twice, and then the beautiful bridge comes in, and once you've heard it about 5x, you sing along;\n\n\"I know-ow....some people search the world...\" \"To fi-ind...somethin' like what we H A A A A V E.\" \"I know-ow...people will try...try to define...somethin' so R E E A L. So till the end of time...I'm tellin' you that...No one...\"\n\nAnd that's the part that grips you, and makes you continue to sing it, along with Alicia...\n\nGreat tune. Will get stuck in your head after a few listens.\n\n4.5 stars.\n\nEnd Note: Great tune. Might have to sink in after repeated listens. Her second single, Like You'll Never See Me Again is even better, believe it or not..","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"On a whim I decided to read the 5 out of 72 (so far) reviews which gave this album 2 or 3 stars.  One of them was a person with a defective product purchased from a third party vendor (I assume) so you have to drop that from the tally and call it 4 out of 72!  What I found remarkable was the people who did not like it or found it maudlin because Gin \"sounds like\" some other current and not so current voice talents.  Excuse me?  She sounds nothing like Amy Winehouse or Adele, not in style or vocal approach.  If anything, to me, she sounds like a modern day Brenda Lee who gargled with just a bit more gravel and wine.  The vocal cord breaks in her voice are even more endearing than any of these, including Brenda.  I purchased (and reviewed) Gravel & Wine not too long ago (just a little over a year now) after being entirely floored by her making the late night talk show rounds to promo the album.  I don't usually, almost never, purchase an album based on one song, but her style was instantly sellable to me!  I had the good fortune to be buying a 5-Star work of perfection, a new artist who congealed all of the more modern music I have liked, and still managed to be ENTIRELY original.  So armed with that knowledge and some hopeful precognition, I took another gamble and bought this one too.  Over the last year Holy Smoke and Gravel & Wine have seesawed for me in appeals for \"best one\".  They each are very slightly different from each other and yet both cut from the same cloth.\n\nIf you have G&W, and if you are looking for more...  More Black Sheep, more Poison, more If Only, more Dirty Love, you will find heaps more here(hear).  In fact, to some degree, I like this album more because of variety.  There are plaintive haunting songs of the likes you would get from The Handsome Family, some (for lack of a better word) alternative country mechanisms from the Legendary Shack Shaker or Alabama3 school, pieces of Theremin induced Bristol Beat influence a la Portishead, and vocal punches from the band which gives her a tremendous sound.  The reviewer who called Holy Smoke \"tinny\" needs a hearing aid or a better sound system, I don't know which.  I've been listening to rock and roll since February 8th, 1964, and believe me, I KNOW tinny, and this album is beautifully mastered for modern sound systems.\n\nI would like to write one of my huge, long winded reviews like I normally do, many people hate it, but more compliment it than otherwise so I continue to provide in-depth, investigative reporting.  Holy Smoke however, would leave me feeling like repeating everything I said in Gravel & Wine.  A quick smart overview:\n\nOh My and Hey Ho, kick off the album perfectly with [1] a rambunctious rocker of self-indulgence and [2] a Portishead meets Brenda Lee instant classic (maybe the best song on the album for its Liquid Kitty lyrics and sci-fi musical haunts).  New Revolution again goes retro to old school belly-rubbing sock-hop dance that channel's Brenda Lee and is musically (I think unintentionally) spiritually linked to Led Zeppelin's I'm Gonna Crawl (In Through The Out Door).  Don't Stop is an ode to \"twinkle toes\" so how do you THINK it sounds?  Gotta love it, and by the by, twinkle toes is Cupid.  I Do is the sort of Ukulele Paul McCartney-ish composition that should bring a smile to everyone's face.  One Last Look is another cute\/smash in your face alt-country tune with Betty Boop goes rockabilly sensuality and tongue in cheek (or someplace else) lyrics.  Golden Ship and Dying Day are beautiful melodious ballads to set you back on the ground after your ride, both tender and inspiring.  Now you'll notice I skipped over two songs.  Too Late For Lovers and Mr. Freakshow are above average compositions, they get 3-1\/2 out of 5 from me, but the rest of the album, all of the rest is 5 star Love It and I wouldn't skip those two on listening either, which tallies the whole thing up to another 5 star album in my book.\n\nSimplest said: Holy Smoke is one of the best original albums I have purchased in the last 5 years and boy is THAT rating hard to come by.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":". . . but I will admit that my doubts (after hearing Grigolo's second recital) about his ability to project adequately in a good-sized house have been put to rest.  He will sing Rodolfo at the Met next season, and here his \"Che gelida manina\" rings out well enough.  The middle of the voice is pleasant to listen to, and if he loses some color as he goes up, well, better singers than he is have that problem too.  I'm still not won over, though.  The bottom of the voice is never really projected in this recital (Calleja's, by contrast, is solid), and I don't like the constant dipping and swelling into and out of that whispery mezza voce.  I know that it's hard to tell on a recording sometimes, but I still have my doubts about how well-supported his soft singing really is.  I don't have these doubts about Calleja and Vargas, for example.  It might finally be a matter of schooling and style -- he doesn't project a well-sustained line, and Calleja does, even when his phrasing isn't all that imaginative.  I did a direct comparison between Calleja (at 25) and Grigolo (at 33) in the sequence from \"Rigoletto\" that starts with \"Ella mi fu rapita\" through \"Parmi veder\" to \"Possente Amor\" -- a sequence, by the way that is heard to as near perfection as you're going to get on Vargas's Verdi disc on RCA.  Neither Calleja nor Grigolo is really near that class, but Calleja projects and maintains the line with firmness, clarity, and good tone, while Grigolo tends to sound fussy and mannered with his little decrescendo effects.  Neither one should have gone for the high hard one at the end of \"Possente Amor\"!  But Calleja was eight years younger, and sounds like the more mature and musical singer.  I read in Grigolo's booklet notes that at 23 he was singing in Beethoven's Ninth for Muti, and I assume Muti by now has veto power over inadequate singers, so I'm still willing to hear how Grigolo develops.\n\nNOTE: About that booklet: no texts, but lots of photos of Vittorio in snazzy suits.

But he was gone for several years and I kinda just forgot about him...then I hear this on the radio, well I hear \"Tonight I'm Loving You\" and I thought this song is great, I went to Youtube and gave it a second listen, then I found out he was really saying something else.  Needless to say, that just made me like the song even more and I must have hit that replay button 100 times, and it still hasn't gotten old yet.\n\nSorry to any people who think he didn't need to be vulgar, but the song makes more sense and is more powerful when he says the other word, and I've never even heard him curse before it's kinda hot lol.  Oh yeah and it's just a word so get over it.\n\nAs for the quality of the song, it has a great beat, it really makes you wanna get up and dance, it has catchy lyrics and an awesome video as well.  I've heard two other songs recently by Enrique and they were just as awesome, I'm so glad he's back and making some great songs!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Most people are familar with Aoife O'Donovan from her work with the Irish folk group, Crooked Still. This is her second solo effort, the first having been titled, \"Fossils.\" That was a beautiful surprise. With this follow-up, \"In The Magic Hour,\" there is no surprise, but an abundance of beauty delivered by Aoife's gorgeous voice and stylings.\nThis is a quiet, subtle album, with a minimalist approach, using just a few musicians on guitar, mandolin, fiddle, bass, organ and drums backing Ms O'Donovan in various combinations. The album begins with \"Stanley Park,\" a lovely introduction to what is to come. The title track is a very Gaelic sounding ballad, describing the contemplations of a woman about death and life history, a contemplation that comes in that liminal space between daylight and full sunset. Gorgeous.\nDonal Og (Young Donald) is a very beautiful, mostly instrumental Irish ballad, very sad, with AD coming in after about two minutes of almost dirge-like music, singing of the pain left behind by a lost love.\nOther outstanding tracks are, \"The King of All Birds,\" \"Magpie,\" and \"Not The Leaving\". Being fair and honest, their are no \"weak\" tracks on this fine effort by Aoife O'Donovan. You will just find that you may like some tracks more than others, simply for personal reasons. Highest recommendation.","classification":5,"fold":1}

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nLYRICS:\nSome say love, it is a river\nThat drowns the tender reed.\nSome say love, it is a razor\nThat leaves your soul to bleed.\nSome say love, it is a hunger,\nAn endless aching need.\nI say love, it is a flower,\nAnd you its only seed.\n\nIt's the heart afraid of breaking\nThat never learns to dance.\nIt's the dream afraid of waking\nThat never takes the chance.\nIt's the one who won't be taken,\nWho cannot seem to give,\nAnd the soul afraid of dyin'\nThat never learns to live.\n\nWhen the night has been too lonely\nAnd the road has been too long,\nAnd you think that love is only\nFor the lucky and the strong,\nJust remember in the winter\nFar beneath the bitter snows\nLies the seed that with the sun's love\nIn the spring becomes the rose.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"If your like me and instantly loved \"Me And My Broken Heart\" your going to enjoy this full length by Rixton.  With groups like Rixton and The Wanted boy bands have been making a comeback. When I first heard \"Me And My Broken Heart\" I seriously thought it was Maroon 5.  It's that close. This debut takes that same formula for the most part. It's a listenable pop collection with acoustic, near a capella and dance\/pop chart toppers. \"Wait On Me\" could and should be the next single. \"Let The Road\"  gets the album started, it's a sweet sounding a capella (almost) that brings to mind the early years of Boys II Men.  Things turn acoustic on \"I Like Girls,\" which breaks the formula, and is a nice sound for the band. The only ballad on the set is \"Whole,\" a radio-friendly track that is really smooth. If your going for the best individual songs try \"Speakerphone\" \"Appreciated\" and \"We All Want The Same Thing.\"  Target has their own edition with two extra songs, \"Make Out\" and the 5:33 remix of \"Me & My Broken Heart\" by PNAU. Unfortunately the PNAU mix is horrible as it leaves out the chorus of the original and pitches up the vocals to the point they sound like chipmunks!  Seriously Rixton, did you guys not hear this mix before you let it on your CD?? It's verging on insulting to your talent(s).

From my perspective, all mixed up by 311 appears to be about figuring out the wisest actions and the best ways for an individual to go along in their life while successfully separating a sea of both critical and well-meaning people who may be trying to steer a man or woman another way. With the lyrics, trust your instincts, Im guessing that all mixed up by 311 symbolizes tuning into your intuition as the smoothest way to go when trying to successfully separate what a person wishes to personally do in comparison to what their critics, friends, and\/or family members may tell them.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Amazing, that's the first word that came to mind when I first heard Crazy Lixx's new album, New Religion. Along with Crashdiet, Reckless Love, Hardcore Superstar and Dirty Penny, these guys are bringing back the sleaze, or hair-metal if you prefer that term instead.\n\nNew Religion starts off strong with Rock And A Hard Place, it then really hits you in the face with My Medicine R.O.C.K., 21 Till I Die, Blame It On Love and Voodoo Woman. Another awesome record, that could easily boast 5-7 singles if it was ever heard on radio here in the states. These guys definitely love their rock 'n' roll, and i'm damn glad I finally discovered alot of these new Swedish bands, the only problem is, their records are pretty pricey and aren't easy to find.\n\nI would reccommend these guys if you like Bon Jovi, Poison, Warrant, Ratt, Motley Crue and Def Leppard. They don't sound like all those bands, but they are that good, they surely deserve alot more attention than they are currently recieving.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"If Dick Clark is the world's oldest teenager, then Redman is the world's oldest ten year old. In his 20 year history, he has amassed a long and respectable career as a rapper- sophmoric humor aside. His first three albums are widely considered classic albums- starting with his 1992 debut \"Whut? Thee Album\", the rather dark sophomore effort \"Dare Iz A Darkside\", and 1996's \"Muddy Waters\". He experienced his biggest success with 1998's \"Doc's Da Name 2000\", an album that garnered him his biggest radio hit as well as a platinum album to boot. Over the years, he has released other solo albums, dabbled in films and done a couple of collaborative albums- notably with Method Man as well as his Def Squad project with Keith Murray and mentor\/producer Erick Sermon. While those albums were critically acclaimed and well received, it seemed that Redman was playing it safe, not branching out from his comfort zone- that is until now, when he released his new album \"Reggie\".\n\nFor those expecting a typical Redman album, there are two things that need to be addressed. One: It's a very left of center effort without any songs produced by Erick Sermon. Two: The songs that preceded the release \"Lookin' Fly\" and \"Coc Back\" are not on the album. Save for the DJ Khalil produced first single \"Def Jammable\" and the Rockwilder produced role playing \"Mic, Lights, Camera, Action\", most of the production on the album is handled by virtual unknowns. While \"Reggie\" is billed as a \"pop record\", it's more along the lines of a mature record- look no further than the songs \"Lemme Get 2\" in which Redman extols in the virtues of travelling and seeing the world and the Faith Evans featured \"All I Do\", which he dedicates to his fans. While this album is devoid of any Erick Sermon production, the closing track \"Tiger Crane Style\" sounds very much like something he would have done. Lastly, no Redman album would be complete without the signature weed song. In this case, it's \"Lite 1 Witcha Boi\" featuring Method Man and Bun B- reprising his appearance with them after appearing on their 2009 album \"Blackout 2\". A couple of the songs on \"Reggie\" could have been left off- such as \"Lift It Up\" and the bland \"Whn The Lights Go Off\". \"Reggie\" is a project worth checking out, but it's not for everyone. It's going to take a few spins to truly get into this album- as it is completely different from anything Redman has ever done.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"In 1980 when \"Keep On Loving You\" hit the airwaves I was a couple years out of college and grateful for the passing of disco as I was finding my footing in my first \"real\" career job. Speedwagon's music fit perfectly with my life and the intense emotions of a young adult out in the world. Keep On Loving You brings back a real mix of feelings and reminds me how I was feeling back in those days..\n\nKeep On Loving you was especially timely as it hit the airwaves just when a relationship which seemed to have great promise fell apart. I got the \"Hi Infidelity\" album and recorded it to cassette to play in my car. Pretty much all of the Hi Infidelity music fits into my category of driving music. I wore that old cassette out and hard to record another.\n\nI don't have cassettes any more but the MP3 I have hooked into my car audio features \"Keep On Loving You\" prominently on my driving playlist and I still love driving beat and smooth harmony of the vocals.\n\nREO Speedwagon's \"Keep On Loving You\" and the whole \"High Infidelity\" album have stood the test of time and hold up well for me even 35 years later. It's great music to listen to while driving and takes me back to a intense emotional time in my life. I think it's an essential track whether you were coming into age in 1980 or caught it much later. It stands the test of time and is worthy of 5 stars from me.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"This is not the cacophonous circus that two big bands playing together (for the first time, without rehearsal, and in one 12-hour session) might have become.  Think of it as one large ensemble (like Kenton's 40+ piece mellophone orchestra) commanded by a first captain (Ellington) and two assistant directors (Basie and Strayhorn).  Basie, the spokesperson for understatement, and Ellington, the supreme creator of small ensembles within larger ensembles: the result is sensible, swinging, and frequently exhilarating music--with enough spontaneity to satisfy even a Charles Mingus.\n\nIn fact, Mingus was the only musician the ultra permissive Ellington ever fired from his band--at the insistence of Juan Tizol, after the volatile bassman had come at the trombonist with a fire ax.  On the occasion of this recording, Tizol again insisted that Ellington fire someone--trumpeter Cat Anderson, who had nearly sliced off his head with a spiraling Sam Woodyard cymbal. \" It's him or me,\" said Juan.  Ellington may have been agreeable, but the Maestro was not about to submit to an ultimatum issued in public by his trombonist.  So \"First Time\" was the last time for Juan Tizol.\n\nMusical highlights include some heated exchanges between the two bands' top soloists, especially Thad Jones vs. Cat Anderson, and Frank Foster + Frank Wess vs. Paul Gonsalves (who could hold his own in any company).  Also, Wess' flute (an instrument that didn't interest Ellington) and Jimmy Hamilton's clarinet do a memorable \"pas de deux.\"  At the same time, not bringing together the lead altoists--Johnny Hodges and Marshall Royal--is a wasted opportunity.  On the whole, the affair favors Basie over Ellington, whose subtle, nuanced palette and sophisticated compositional genius are less apparent than usual.  The Freddie Green rhythm guitar would all but clinch it as a primarily Basie date were it not for the rich percussive colors and personal back-beat (as opposed to Sonny Payne's broader stroke) of Sam Woodyard.\n\nA minor disappointment is the audio on this 2008 edition.  There's some breaking up of the sound during the climactic ensemble passages of the main burner, \"Battle Royal.\"  Perhaps mine is a defective copy, because after the perfect sound of the digitalized and reissued \"Ellington at Newport 1956,\" a buyer would have the right to expect as much of a 1962 date.  Otherwise, the reissue presents complete tracks for the first time and adds 11 tracks to the 8 on the original album.  The notes are copious, informative, and frequently absorbing.\n\nLike the Ellington\/Coltrane meeting, this is not an Ellington essential, but then again it's one no fan of either member of the royal pair would want to be without.","classification":4,"fold":1}

However, what we get are americana-tinged rockers that owe a great debt to Springsteen (\"Imposters (Little By Little)\", \"Baby Don't Lie To Me\", and the ballad \"Slow\" - the latter rather nice), as well as songs that almost sound like pastiche (the groovy rocker \"Thief\" strongly recalls Ray Parker Jr's \"Ghostbusters\" while \"Dogtown\" recalls The Beatles' \"Come Together\"). They are not bad, just deficit in originality.\n\nSaving the day are the epic opening number \"Me And The Devil\" with a delicate piano intro leading to a bouncy theatrical sound and Jon Fratelli singing lines like \"I'm gonna sell this soul of mine\", the mellow and melodic \"Desperate Guy\", the bluesy \"Getting Surreal\", and the ballad \"Moonshine\" with a world weary-sounding performance. \"I may be bleeding but I feel just fine\" go the lines in part.

{"text":"It is hard to believe that Seal is celebrating his 20th anniversary since his debut album right now. While he has had a lot of highs, musically and personally, the past several years have been very hard for him. With his marriage to Heidi Klum ending, and his albums not as strong as they used to be, he seems to be at a personal crossroads in his life. Nothing he has done in music has ever had the impact he made with Kiss From A Rose, from the Batman Forever soundtrack and off his second self-titled album. The song is still his biggest opus that is just as good today, as it was when it came out in 1994. It definitely is a great download if you are new to Seal's music, or if you want to hear what a real voice is like, and not something that is weighed down.

{"text":"\"A Single Man\" by Elton John is a hard one to evaluate. On the one hand, the songs are mostly good ones; and the production is super sweet! Very soft and understated. But Elton's vocals are mostly dis-engaged and generally charmless.\n\n\"Return to Paradise\" might just be; what with those beautiful falsetto vocals, \"Georgia\" might  be an under-rated one of those Southern Anthems that filled up \"Tumbleweed Connection\". But, for me, the real nuggets are the final three songs \"Madness\", \"Reverie\" and \"Song for Guy\", which all sit well together, kind of a trio of darkness, really; \"Madness\" is a spine chilling disco-prog-rocker with lots of haunting piano chords; \"Reverie\" is brief but effective, and \"Song for Guy\" is suitably melancholy and ethereal, given it's essentially a requiem. The vocal part is particularly evocative.\n\nThe other songs aren't bad. \"I don't care\" is a fun rocker in the style of his earlier ones, but the vocals don't relay the fun. \"Part-time love\" is the best of the rest, a pumpy little tune with a big production. Not a bad album, Rating **1\/4 or 2.25","classification":2,"fold":1}

{"text":"...Which is my only complaint with this record. I pre-ordered the whole thing over a month ago and got the free download. After a month of digesting, I must say that this really is not as musically redeeming as other NIN albums, and thats not because of the lack of vocals. I've always loved NIN since the Broken days and I think every album up to this one was great in its own way. To me, each track on Ghosts seems like an incomplete musical idea. As soon as one track starts to build and get interesting, it ends. Other tracks are just looped sound effects with no real variation. More than anything, this album is a fantastic showcase of electronic sound effects. I think its really cool the types of sounds Trent has made with his electronical synths and moogs, and other various toys. Ghosts really shows you what you are capable of doing with todays modern electronic musical equipment. Sadly, as a NIN album it failed to hold my attention, even as background music. I think if Trent were to take the strongest tracks here and have them fully realized into songs, then it would really feel like a new NIN album. This is an experimental effort only. But a cool one. Needless to say, I don't think its worth the $300 dollars (now $600 on ebay) for the special Ed with the Vinyl records. Bottom line, definitely get this if you are a NIN fan at all because it is a fun listen and there are cool sounds on here. Just beware, as the songs don't tend to go anywhere. Have fun.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Alanis Morissette once again changes images with the release of her third major album, UNDER RUG SWEPT.  Morissette's image on JAGGED LITTLE PILL is the angry alt-rocker, furious at men for being such pigs and lowlifes.  On SUPPOSED FORMER INFATUATION JUNKY, she has wedded her image to a deep sense of spirituality.  UNDER RUG SWEPT takes these two images and combines them in a deft move of maturity.\nUNDER RUG SWEPT reads like an autobiography of Morissette's love life with a definite progression of lyrical themes, climaxing in the last track \"Utopia\".\nOn the album, you won't find anger like you did on JAGGED LITTLE PILL's most powerful tracks, though you will find pain.  You won't find the SFIJ's rich spirituality save for \"Utopia\".  Instead, UNDER RUG SWEPT gives us a very traceable narrative.\nThis narrative begins by Morissette defining what she wants in a lover.  She hooks up with a music exec (described angrily in JAGGED LITTLE PILL's track \"Right Through You\") who has underage sex with her in \"Hands Clean.\"  In \"Right Through You,\" Morissette is very angry, but \"Hands Clean\" is almost journalistic in approach.\nMorissette explores the negative impact of this situation in the next two tracks, \"Flinch\" and \"So Unsexy.\"  In \"Flinch,\" Morissette talks about how she is trying hard not to flinch at his name.  In \"So Unsexy,\" she says it's been almost a decade and still hurts, which for me definitely links this track \"Hands Clean.\"\n\nEventually, Morissette finds a lover (\"That Particular Time), but they need time apart.  The relationship is complex, and you get the his viewpoint in the guitar-heavy track \"A Man.\"  She tells him she loves him and will do whatever it takes for him to be happy, and in the end they live in Utopia.  \"Utopia\" sounds more like her hopes and dreams, and here the album ceases its narrative style and turns into a very hopeful and optimistic view of what the world could be like.\n While novelistic songwriting is fascinating, Morissette' songs can be too easily construed as clich-driven.  Rolling Stones' review said UNDER RUG SWEPT had enough clichs to make up a whole season of Oprah.\n Hearing the songs outside the album's context, Morissette has indeed turned from an original writing style to rather blah psychobabble, sounding like the Democratic Party's singing mascot.  All of UNDER RUG SWEPT's songs rely on each other for context, especially \"Hands Clean.\"  She says plainly in the early part of her career, she and one of her mentors had an inappropriate relationship, and she's had to live with that.  Just hearing the song without knowing the album, you think she is just trying to push the limits.  The album, however, makes it quite clear the negative effects it has had.\n Overall, a fascinating album that, once you understand what she is doing, proves to be a rewarding and fulfilling listening experience.  Without understanding, however, UNDER RUG SWEPT appears as an artistic stumble.  Once you realise what's going on, Morissette proves herself once again as a valid and intriguing musical artist.\nP. S.  Just a few thoughts about Glen Ballard and his relationship with Morissette.\nFor those who speculate that the music exec Morissette is singing about in \"Hands Clean\" is Glen Ballard, and I think I can very safely say this, is just flat out wrong.  Glen Ballard produced her 1995 JAGGED LITTLE PILL.  Morissette was 21 when PILL was released.  What many Americans don't know is Morissette had a musical career in Canada, and her debut album was released in 1991.  Morissette had appeared on a star finding program.  When she was ten, Morissette starred as a regular cast member of the television show \"You Can't Do That On TV.\"\nMorissette, however, wanted to be in the music industry, so she used the show as a stepping stone both financially and public relation-wise.  She had signed a music publishing contract the age of 14, and the video of `Hands Clean\" clearly links the song with the early years of her career.\nChronologically, the conclusion that Glen Ballard is the one who had under-age sex with Morissette simply does not add up.  This conclusion also ignores lyrical indicators in both PILL and UNDER RUG SWEPT as well.  In \"Right Through You,\" she sings about the exec scanning the credits and wonder why he's not there.  Glen Ballard is listed and fully credited as producer.  \"Right Through You\" also tells us this happened much earlier than her teaming with Ballard.  Had it been Ballard, I don't think Morissette would have let him produce not one but two records, with three years separating the two.\nUNDER RUG SWEPT makes it quite clear the situation has caused her a lot of pain.  I do not think it would have been possible for her to have a professional working relationship with Ballard over the course of two records that have such a vast time-span between them.  It took three years for her to deliver PILL's follow-up.  With the emotional trauma she has experienced, do you really think Morissette would let him helm up two of her three records?  I don't think so.  Chronologically it doesn't add up either.  This leads me to the conclusion whoever the music exec is, it's definitely not Glen Ballard.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"So this is Jewel. I was surprised when I saw the album cover a few months ago. Slowly but surely \"Intuition\" grew on me, it's a fun dance number about pop culture and materialism. I understand with this project now that Jewel wanted to encorporate her meaningful lyrics with dance music, showing that it is possible. It's not a sell out either, since this music isn't popular like it was a few years ago. Not to say it's bad by any means. The best track for me is \"2 Find U\", a nice love song. \"Run 2 U\" is another favorite. \"Leave The Lights On\" has a nice groove and reminds me a bit of Nelly Furtado. \"Haunted\" is another great track here. \"2 Become 1\" is a great love song. The album reminds me a bit of Sheryl Crow's second album, picking up strands of pop music and familiar lyrics, and including odd pop-culture references and name-dropping along the songs. This is still the same Jewel, just with dance beats. And it is her most enjoyable album yet.

{"text":"The prolific Philip Anselmo returns with another project, the newly minted Scour. Their self-titled debut EP offers five songs and one short, ambient piece. While Phil's fans have long known that he enjoys extreme metal, we've never gotten any quite like this from him. His debut solo album was a vicious mix of grind and groove with classic screaming Phil vocals, but Scour is straight-up black\/death metal with Phil delivering the sickest roars and shrieks of his recording career. Most of the songs are intensely fast and raw, with a distinctly black metal style and sound. Unlike every other band I've heard from Phil, I don't hear a trace of Pantera in Scour's sound. I think this band could make an outstanding vehicle for Phil's extreme side, given that the music sounds nothing like Superjoint or his solo efforts. Although you can often hear that trademark Phil screech, his style here is much more in the extreme metal style, with guttural death metal growls and scraping, acidic, black metal shrieks. If you're into Phil Anselmo's more aggressive side, you should enjoy getting pummeled by Scour.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"As with most music, I was introduced to this song from a workout that was choreographed to it.  I downloaded it afterwards and at first I thought, finally, here is a song that respects women and talks about a guy having found the one, not feeling tempted by other women, and being ready to settle down. BUT...upon further listening, I realized all the things he likes about this woman are that, \"she gives me love and affection\" and \"she is always right there when I need her.\"  There's nothing about what he does for her.  His mom approves of her, so all that's left for him to do is \"pop the question.\"  I know, I'm probably being nitpicky, but really, what does he do for her on a regular basis?  Is he her cheerleader too?  Does he give her love and affection?  It's very one-sided.  So, it's a really catchy song and fun to workout to, but...I'm still searching for a pop song by a man that has a good message for\/about women.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Blowing off enough steam to trounce a dozen Don Juan wanna-be's - Alicia Bridges power punches her way through the classic 'disco dancing' ballad \"I Love The Nightlife\"; with no more than an original set of vocals, wildly emotive inflections & intonations (that easily set fire to the 'serious self-stature' themes in the song), a dizzying display of 'unrelenting feminine' provocativeness, and commanding control of her deeply emotional crescendos.\n\nWe take in her message to unfaithful boyfriends, how they line up in her perception of romance, and how she deals with their galavanting all over town - thinking she would stay home and stitch their socks. More couples danced way into the night in wild excitement with this one song - than anyone could imagine - from Moscow to Manhattan - from Paris to Omaha. There is so much life, vigor, and honesty in this song with the trumpets blaring their triumphant salute to her 'stand your ground if he messes around' anthem for women throughout the world. A truly remarkable accomplishment for the artists involved. Written by Bridges and Susan Hutcheson; produced by Steve Buckingham.\n\n\"Please don't talk about love tonight.\nYour sweet talking won't make it right.\nLove and lies just bring me down\nwhen you've got women all over town.\nYou can love them all and when you're through,\nmaybe that'll make, huh, a man out of you.\nI got to go where the people dance.\nI want some action ... I want to live!\n\nAction ... I got so much to give.\nI want to give it. I want to get some too.\n\nOh, I ... Ohhh I ...

While most of the acts from the so-called \"British Invasion\" enjoyed success on both sides of the \"pond\", to the best of my knowledge Chad and Jeremy never even appeared on the charts in England. Seems very strange to me because here in America Chad and Jeremy made quite a splash in 1964 and 1965. As another reviewer has duly noted Chad and Jeremy produced several hit records with \"harmonies to die for\". Of course the biggest hit was the one everyone is familiar with. \"A Summer Song\" peaked at #7 in September 1964. The boys released a dozen or so more singles over the next few years but could never repeat the success of \"A Summer Song\". This tune sounds every bit as good today as it did when it was recorded more than 50 years ago.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Isn't it every dad's dream to someday play in a band with his son? I know I often think about how cool it would be to have my son playing drums to some little ditty I wrote over a cup of coffee at the kitchen table. And it wouldn't have to be my son. One of my daughters rocking the Rickenbacker bass as I strum some indie rock trash on my out-of-tune Fender would be this Papa's dream, really. Well, as much as us dad rockers like to dream about the family band scenarios it rarely happens. In Jeff Tweedy's case though he's living the dream. And not only did he make a record with his son Spencer on drums, but it's a damn great record. It's the best album Jeff Tweedy has made in ten years, if you want to know the truth. You didn't? Well too bad. Sukierae is a sprawling double album that goes from Deerhoof experimentalism, to pop giddiness, to lulling acoustic tracks, all before you get to side C. In other words, Tweedy has made the White Album for the modern age.\n\nMost of the time dad and son will buy some flowers, a box of chocolates, and a Hallmark expression of adoration when wanting to do something special for mom. In the Tweedy household they hole up in a loft and make a double album and name it after mom affectionately. Sukierae is a love letter to Sue Tweedy, as well as being a chance for father and son to bond over what they love. Most fathers and sons would rebuild an engine, or remodel a kitchen. But for Jeff Tweedy and son Spencer they bond over rock 'n roll, and rock they do. \"Please Don't Let Me Be So Misunderstood\" barrels out of the speakers with a snarl and a vitriol not heard from Mr. Tweedy in a very long time. \"High As Hello\" is simple by design but becomes something cooler, sleeker as the song rolls along. \"World Away\" sounds like something that would've fit nicely on an early solo Lennon album. It's got a hell of a groove with Tweedy sounding looser than he has in a while. Sonically this record goes back to A Ghost Is Born with its dry, natural feel. It's sparse without sounding thin. \"Low Key\" is a piece of folksy pop bliss and benefits greatly from the pared down arrangement and some excellent background vocals. \"Pigeons\" is an acoustic track that shows there's nothing more powerful in Jeff Tweedy's arsenal than simply an acoustic guitar. But there's also plenty of experimental sounds coming out of the speakers. \"I'll Sing It\" is a rocking track that falls apart into noise and buzz before going into an almost \"Dear Prudence\" crescendo at the end. \"Flowering\" has a little of The Band in it's slightly funky rhythm courtesy of Spencer's Levon Helm-leaning drums and some great bass courtesy of Papa Tweedy. It's great hearing Jeff back on the bass as well. He's a natural rhythm man. \"Desert Bell\" is a pretty country-ish waltz that Willie Nelson would be proud to call his own, while \"Summer Noon\" is the closest we come to hearing what these songs would've sounded like being recorded by the whole Wilco crew. You know, every song on Sukierae is perfect, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention closing track \"I'll Never Know\". It's a beautiful, haunting track that I listened to three times in a row the first time I heard it. \"I remember the room with the TV on\/And you sitting asleep before you were gone\", Tweedy sings over a simple acoustic and piano. For me, this song has the power of a song like \"She's A Jar\", or \"Jesus, Etc\". It's a gut punch of an ending to a hell of an album.\n\nWhether it's a love letter to a wife and a mom, or a father and son bonding session, one thing's for sure: Sukierae is a sprawling masterpiece. It's also a welcome return one of our finest songwriters.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"This CD is more than Rodrigo's Concerto. Most reviewers ignored the Albeniz, but before I get to those tracks, I will say that the Concerto de Aranjuez is a live recording and that spark does manifest. Narciso Yepes, Julian Bream, and John Williams are better classical guitarists than Paco de Lucia, but in this recording the partner orchestra has a superior performance than others. Morever, de Lucia's third movement is more sensitive than his guitar colleagues. On the negative side, this is an old recording and the sound engineering is very good but not up to the standards of today. The guitar, a quiet instrument, merges with the orchestra. The concerto for guitar seems more concerto for symphony orchestra and guitar. Together, however, this version, indeed interpetation, as the label notes, is very fine but not outstanding. As for the 3-guitar version of three excerpts from Iberia by Isaac Albeniz, I find them entirely wrong in musical concept. Listen to Alicia de Larroucha perform the suite as it should be, on piano. The guitars are tinny and the musical punch is lost. The piano is orchestral in its range and we truly hear the melodies and feel the emotions of each section. Thus, given a choice, I would choose another album with Rodrigo's concerto.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"I think Emanuel Ax has settled into routine playing as he's aged, but these are premiere Chopin interpretations from two decades ago. Now that Sony and BMG have merged their classical divisions, it's possible to issue Ax's excellent 1985 reading of the four Ballades--the best ever done by an American--with a 1988 recital of Mazurkas and the four Scherzi. The first recital was originally on RCA, the second on Sony. But just to confuse things a bit more, the readings here of Scherzos #2 and #4 are dropped in from an even earlier RCA recording.\n\nThe provenance won't matter that much to the general listener, who will be happy with the budget price for probably the best Chopin two-fer on the market. Begin listening with the four Ballades, where Ax is at his most impassioned and inspired. Even three years later, when he got to Scherzos #1 and #3, he had become more refined and relaxed, less a romantic risk-taker. He's remained that way ever since, but here at least we can hear Ax in his glory.  Faithful as I am to Pollini and Kisin in this repertoire, this collection often rises to their heights.\n\nP.S. 2011 - I returned to this CD recently, wondering if the rather uninspired music-making of Ax in later years indicated that I was mistaken about him early on. But I must say that his set of Ballades holds up next to the greatest I've ever heard. they are the definition of charismatic.","classification":5,"fold":1}

The song didn't really impress me, however his second single Slowly blew and I decided to give his debut album Forces Of Nature a chance. Needless to say the album wasn't that good and his follow up release One Man didn't fare much better for me either. Tank was M.I.A. for five years before his next release the worthy follow up Sex, Love & Pain which featured the huge hit Please Don't GO. Now with his fourth album Now or Never, Tank has not only delivered his best album but one of the best R&B albums of 2010. From the opening  interlude Showtime to the triple punch of the singles Sex Music, Celebration & Emergency there isn't one song on this CD that needs to be skipped over. This is an album for people who appericate real R&B and it's a testament to an artist's talent to have an album with all slow jams which never becomes boring. The central theme of this CD is sex which is evident in the songs Sex Music, Foreplay, Can I and Emergency. However Tank does touch on relationships with Keep it 100 and his excellent cover of I Can't Make You Love Me. All this is a fine album overall and I'm glad that Tank finally found his voice in R&B.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Some of my earliest popular music memories consist of Paul Simon (and Simon & Garfunkel) songs. My father bought their music in the 1960's and 1970's, so I remember hearing \"The Boxer\", \"Mother and Child Reunion\", \"Me & Julio Down By The Schoolyard\", \"Kodachrome\", \"Slip Sliding Away\", \"Late In The Evening\" and most importantly, as a child of divorce, \"50 Ways To Leave Your Lover\".\n\nAll this primed me for 1986's \"Graceland\". I say \"Graceland\" because 1983's \"Hearts and Bones\" didn't even register. So, it was, in the autumn of 1986, that I saw the video for \"You Can Call Me Al\" and then \"The Boy in the Bubble\". I bought the cassette tape of \"Graceland\" in March 1987, and since that time I have bought all of Simon's solo albums and a Simon & Garfunkel \"Best Of\". I have consistently purchase each new Simon album since 1987, though I have not once seen him in concert.\n\nAnyway, \"Stranger To Stranger\" does what I complain most artists do not do--be original, keep experimenting. I give it to Simon, now age 74, for continuing to experiment musically, unlike, say, fellow contemporary, Bob Dylan. \"Stranger To Stranger\" is also lyrically thought provoking, a first for Simon since, well, \"The Rhythm Of The Saints\" (1990). For me, anyway.\n\n\"The Werewolf\", \"Wristband\", \"Street Angel\", \"In A Parade\", \"The Riverbank\" and \"Cool Papa Bell\" are all standouts.\n\nThe three ballads, \"Stranger To Stranger\", \"Proof Of Love\" and \"Insomniac's Lullaby\" are okay. I've always taken an issue with Simon's ballads as I find them rather bland, usually.\n\nThere are two instrumentals, which to me, are disposable: \"The Clock\" and \"In The Garden Of Edie\".\n\nThen there are all those bonus tracks, five to be exact. Disposable, all of them.\n\nSo, as you can see, for me, this is four stars, not five. Five would be \"Paul Simon\" (1972), \"There's Goes Rhymin' Simon\" (1973), \"Still Crazy After All These Years\" (1975), \"Graceland\" (1986) and \"The Rhythm Of The Saints\" (1990). I can listen to any of those and not skip a single track. I could sing the entire \"Graceland\" album in my sleep, I know it so well.\n\nKeep rocking (or is it now lilting?) Paul. The music business still needs artist like you. There's so few of you around--Bob Dylan, Randy Newman, The Who, The Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Tom Waits, Don Henley, Fleetwood Mac, and....Leonard Cohen.....and.....?\n\nSee you in another five years.\n\nThis is how \"Stranger To Stranger\" compares to Simon's other solo works:\n\n1972 Paul Simon: Five Stars\n1973 There Goes Rhymin' Simon: Five Stars\n1975 Still Crazy After All These Years: Five Stars\n1980 One Trick Pony: Two Stars\n1983 Hearts And Bones: Three Stars\n1986 Graceland: Five Stars\n1990 The Rhythm Of The Saints: Five Stars\n1997 Songs From The Capeman: One Star\n2000 You're The One: Four Stars\n2006 Surprise: Three Stars\n2011 So Beautiful Or So What: Three and a Half Stars","classification":4,"fold":1}

Nevertheless, her death is one of the saddest tragedies in the music industry. Yet, she still is remembered for her voice and that spirit could've been showed better on Lioness: Hidden Treasures. But one of the better songs on the album is Our Day Will Come. The song is not bad, and one of the better songs from her posthumous release. It showed that no matter how heartbroken she was, she still let her voice speak well. It is just so sad that it really is one of the more decent songs from the album. It might've been a better release of Amy was alive today, yet it so sad that a gifted soul like her was gone too soon.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"When you integrate one proficient acoustic guitarist with select vocalists and instrumentalists, along with the skillful production talents of Windham Hill Records founder and Grammy Winner Will Ackerman, the final product might expectedly be a top rated album compiled by dedicated music professionals that virtually everyone would love and appreciate.\n\nShambhu is the proficient guitarist clearly asserting in his website news pages that his first album has truly been a \" labor of love \" while composing, performing and co-producing with Will Ackerman, along with his time spent working beside other top music professionals.  This I can believe since at the end of the day, Shambhu and his insightful selection of collaborating musicians has paid off rather handsomely, and by their collective time spent together, have helped convert this debut release into a commodity of premium value.\n\nSacred Love - Feel The Journey is New Age Fusion, Contemporary Instrumental, and Jazz, having East, West, and World elements which help facilitate the conversion of artful melodies into solid gold entertainment that requires only simple involvement for the rest of us to acquire the appreciable benefits of this grand endeavor.  Sacred Love has already achieved a quantifiable amount of success, where at present Sacred Love - Feel The Journey is # 1 for the month of October 2010 in ZMR's Top 100 Chart, but I also have a feeling this album will appreciate in value even more over time.\n\nShambhu is an esteemed musician in his own right performing concerts or on albums with top music entertainers like Bob Hope, Carlos Santana, Jon Anderson and on Whitney Houston's multi-platinum album titled simply Whitney.  The list goes on since Shambhu has also been involved in projects with many of the respected musicians I continually write about like Will Ackerman, Jeff Oster, Eugene Friesen, Ann Licater plus many more.\n\nSacred Love - Feel The Journey on the Acoustic Shine label has an impressive cast and crew since many have toured or recorded with top musical groups themselves.  Some of these artists on Shambhu's album include Tony Levin of Peter Gabriel on bass, Jeff Haynes of Pat Metheny on percussion, George Brooks of John McLaughlin on saxophone, Celso Alberti of Steve Winwood on drums, and then Premik Tubbs of Santana and John McLaughlin on flute.\n\nTogether is the first of 12 songs total and what a memorable impression it creates.  The center stage guitar and violin pairing established securely alongside flute and reflective instrumentation is magnificent, plus it is easy to visualize this song and others in a Cinematic role since the warm, sincere, and dynamic atmosphere echo the characteristic essentials for a multitude of made for the big screen movie settings.\n\nNatural Moment is a warm and casual song that positively takes off and ascends to new heights.  First expressed during the initial sequences, xylophone and numerous percussion enhancements become the lively components that merge into a free spirited narrative complete with smooth and graceful electric guitar rhythms which intensify and progress neatly into a picturesque arrangement.\n\nMaiu Breeze is refreshing by exhibiting a jazzy tropical presence.  First conveyed by acoustic guitar highlights, the integral xylophone rhythms and harmonious vocals filled with energy and vitality are a natural accompaniment to the guitar arrangement.  Together they merge perfectly to bring out the compositional fascination of this album and its entirety, creating a dynamic atmosphere that leaves one with an impression of total harmonic refinement.\n\nThis first release by Shambhu will always be termed a debut as one might expect, but when you consider his proficiency as a guitarist, the impressive number of outstanding talents on this extraordinary album, and their combined lifework totaling a significant number of decades as esteemed music professionals, then this masterful first album by Shambhu truly does amount to a rewarding and appreciable \" labor of love. \"\n\nFull musician credits are Eugene Friesen - cello, Charlie Bisharat - violin, Ravichandra Kulur - flute, Michael Manring - bass, Jill Haley - English horn, Claytoven Richardson - lead vocal, Jeff Oster - flugelhorn, Noah Wilding - vocals Todd Boston - sarod, mixed and engineered by Grammy Award winning Corin Nelsen.","classification":5,"fold":1}

A common theme back then, see album covers by Boston and Journey, Paul McCartney's Back to the Egg, etc.\n\nTurn to Stone features all the common ELO accoutrements: great hooks, magical baroque\/Beatlesesque string arrangements, high falsetto harmonies, interesting synthesizers and effects. I like this one for the 13 second descending metallic fade in, the driving beat, the strings throughout, the weird middle fast spoken bit, the little 'day in the life' outro, the imagery, e.g. 'the tired streets that hide away.' It's a song like the Beatles's 'Misery' - the lyrics tell a story of self-pity and hopelessness, but the music sounds otherwise. No point in 'bringing us down' too much, eh Jeff?

{"text":"I'm in a Weezer mood today. I'm listening to their entire catalog this afternoon and it's not getting old.\n\nI was in high school when these guys rocked the world with 'Buddy Holly'. It meant nothing to me at the time though. Somehow Weezer remained virtually unknown to me for another decade as alternative rock was never my thing in the 90's (You know, the exact time when alternative rock was EVERYONE's thing. I didn't dislike it because I was an ironic hipster in my youth. I was just super lame.)\n\nLooking back on it now, after having enjoyed Weezer for the last decade or so, they really are amazing. They have a distinctive sound that's very alternative but also very much their own. It's also not a hard sound. I find their instrumentals to be soothing ear candy.\n\nAnd it's not an accident that 'Buddy Holly' is the song everyone remembers form the blue album. It's the best song on the album. Yeah it's the one with the most radio play, but that's because it's awesome. 'Susanne' is a close second, mainly because it reminds me of the closing credits to Mallrats. (Which I loved in the 90's but had no idea it was Weezer sining. I told you I was lame.) But 'Susanne' is only available on the deluxe version of the Blue Album. It's not available via the Prime streaming option. If you're buying the album, the Deluxe version is the only way to go. Don't get just the basic version.","classification":5,"fold":1}

And although this appearance is better than the last song they did together, this one still lacks. Vocally, Kroeger fits the song, and Santana plays some awesome riffs that keep you moving, and the song afloat. Without that amazing aspect, the song sinks with sub-par lyrics, however, you can only keep coming back to Santana's amazing guitar mastery and craft. A good song musically, a somewhat lazy performance vocally.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Linkin Park The Hunting Party is as many people have refer to as the band going back to their roots from the music of their first two albums.  I shall do a review of the album song by song, Keys to the Kingdom was a screamo music into to the CD with Mike Rapping and Chester screaming about how he messed up his life in order to achieve the \"Keys to the Kingdom.\"  All for Nothing was another Mike rapping and Chester rocking out about achiving \"What I deserve\" while sometimes feeling as if you are being betrayed.  Guilty all the Same is a great rock song with Chester describing how we all are \"Gulity all the Same\" while featuring a guest rap star named Rakin who raps on the song to add flavor to an already amazing rock song.  The Summoning is an musical interlue that help add flavor to the CD.  War was another screamo song with Chester screaming about how the War is destorying you as a person.  Wastelands is another song with Mike rapping and Chester rocking out about the world becoming \"The Wastelands of today.\"  Until it's Gone features a rock song we have heard lyrics wise over and over again but you can feel Chester's pain in the lyrics or even your own pain if you been hurt that badly.  Rebellion is a good rock song about people surviving by facing their fears by the Rebellion.  Mark the Graves is a good rock song featuring lyrics about losing people you care or love by \"Mark the Graves.\"  Drawbar is another musical interlue featuring though the music style of Tom Morello who is part of Audioslave.  Final Masquerade is another good rock song about reaching the end of your line with your \"Final Masquerade.\"  A Line in the Sand is the last song on the album but title reminds me of a WWE song with the same title but Linkin Park's lyrics are different then the WWE ones, but still the Linkin Park song great end to an amazing CD of rock, metal, screamo and so forth music.","classification":4,"fold":1}

Elton John, as did Eric Clapton came back from the DrugDead as few entertainers did in the day.  This song always does it for me deep inside as I did fully appreciate Elton John, seeing him many times but I never did see Lennon.  It makes me feel that John also was my friend who has gone.

{"text":"I appear to be one of the few reviewers who feel equally comfortable reviewing any political album, irrespective of whether it supports the left or the right. Maybe this is because I've seen enough that no political ideology has all the answers, and I don't have the answers either. I therefore find it interesting to hear all the viewpoints, even though I disagree with some of them. Here, Ry Cooder points out plenty of problems as he sees them. He clearly feels passionate about politics, but like the rest of us, he does not have the solutions.\n\nMusically, I would describe this as a folk-blues album in which Ry Cooder sings in a nearly-speaking style. His prowess as a musician sometimes shows through, but if you really want to hear Ry Cooder the musician, you have to go back to the earlier albums that he recorded before he decided to focus on political music. This reminds me that I should re-acquaint myself with Chicken skin music, which I haven't heard for over 30 years.\n\nRy Cooder spends a lot of the album attacking the Republicans, beginning with the opening song in which he sings the part of Mitt Romney's dog. Judging by the references in four songs to Jim Crow (Brother in song, Cold, cold feeling. Going to Tampa, Take your hands off it), it appears that he thinks the Republicans would like to return to a time when blacks and whites lived segregated lives in America.\n\nCommitted Democrat voters will probably love the sentiments expressed here, but I doubt if it's the kind of album that would convince an undecided voter that they should vote Democrat. The one thing missing from this album is a song that offers hope for the future. Nevertheless, this is still an enjoyable album.","classification":4,"fold":1}

Ill say here and now, with no hesitation or reservation, that Eminem is easily the best rapper Ive ever heard. No popular rapper you can think of, alive or dead, even comes close. I mightve been saying the same about guest Royce Da 5-9 if he weren't upstaged by a rapper whose comedic wit, clever wordplay and sheer rhyme skills near genius.\n\nThere is very little filler in Eminems verses. Even when hes lacing them with unnecessary profanities; the Slim Shady persona is a deviant (white-trash) druggie who aims to offend; almost every two bars are a quality set and many of those sets are classic quotables. Unless hes cheating it somehow, his creativity is close to amazing. He even does his own sound effects. The beats are also impressive, so the albums only major drawbacks fall on faulty choruses and silly skits.\n\nmarcellee.com","classification":4,"fold":1}

If you have the album, I suggest buying this MP3. If you have the album on the an mp3 player, I suggest buying this MP3 and replacing it for the album track. This is also known as \"Let it go Extended\". As sucky as it was to put the edited video version on the album, I still think buying this mp3 in addition to the album is worth the extra $0.89 Amazon is charging for it.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I cannot express how nice it was to get to review a guitar based album, as one who strums the strings of power myself it was good to get to grips with Perfect Imperfection from Tom Carleno. This is an album of very clever and adept finger style guitar playing by a man who clearly has a great depth and passion for his music; you can see this on track one called In Search Of. A delightful negative refrain at times, then some very inspired notes give us an emotive but delightful way to start an album.\nThis album has come at a good time for me, I needed to relax and ease back and my life lately as could be yours, has been frantic, to put it mildly. Perfect Imperfection was the perfect vehicle for me to do so and this next piece was superb, its called Meet me in Maui. Laid back and chilled and already through this music I can feel the inner peace beginning to flow.\nWhen I first started working in radio, I came across the artist Al Stewart and I actually ended up with a show called On The Border after hearing Year of the Cat, I would of course find Als other well know composition of that very name and Carleno does a literal walk through of this classic Stewart song and does it with reverence to its originality, but with a fresh Latin feel to it as well, excellent rendition, played and performed with style and grace and yes I was singing the lyrics along with it!\nNow an interesting title, my dear constant readers, you all know I delight in fresh and new ideas and especially innovative titles, so when Welcome To The Milky Way came on I was in rapture. This is played so beautifully and in an almost ancient style that could take the listener back across the eons of time, across that very Milky Way, there are some very pleasant harmonics on this track as well.\nIts time to raise the rhythm and take the whole venture up tempo, using the guitar in every aspect on Working up an Appetite. There was some great use of the frets, strings and main body of the guitar. On this piece Carlino shows his mastery and shows it well, at around two minutes forty, there is a charming quiet passage that sold this piece for me as one of the best on the album and the powerful chords at the end made it an awesome composition that should take you by the ears and drag you to musical heaven.\nBut wait dear constant reader, there is much more, this next track is so mood filled you will not want to miss out on another enjoyable piece called Timberline Tree, as a guitarist myself I sense this is a arrangement that we call, personal music therapy, this composition just seemed to be so organic and had just about everything you want from a guitar based album, there was something about this piece I felt was so deep, it was so moving and so personal to the artist himself.\nI have heard Bob Ardern and others in this genre play like this, but here Carleno seem to flow with the ease of silver, from a mirrored pool of musical delight. A traditional finger picking piece that I know will absolutely delight you and its called Childs Play\nAs Monty Python once said, now for something completely different and to be honest you couldn't get more different than Rhapsody in Blood. Think Hammer Horror films; think Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing and Vincent Price and you will have it in one. Lets start my friends with wolves baying in the woods, let us start with the creaking sound of strings, like that old evil door.\nYou really have to listen to this composition to get the full benefit from it, but let me just say that Tom Carleno has brought you a movie styled piece of music here, that would fit superbly into any horror film you have ever watched, but BEWARE, the scream, it had my wife jump from her seat whilst she was editing another show to say to me, Did you hear a woman screaming outside?\nYes Rhapsody in Blood is really a fun piece to play, but I must say that Tom Carleno has not only done a good job here, but also enjoyed doing it, my only regret is he didn't ask me to add some audio  after the wolves, saying that old Dracula classic line Hark, can you hear them? The children of the night Wonderful track, you will love this.\nAlways room for a classic, many have done it recently, but here and rather appropriately, Carleno chooses Imagine by John Lennon, this is a song that for some reason people seem to play more at Christmas and here it sits at number nine on the album. Its respectfully played and one more song that you will want to sing along to.\nA little more time dear reader, to sample some of the perfection which we can now call Carlenos finger picking guitar on the piece Brief Encounter, before we fall into the lap of the last piece off the album called What A Difference A Day Makes. This is a gentle track to end with and in all honesty this is a delicious album and being an unbiased guitarist, I would recommend this to anyone, I would urge all guitarists to buy this, its has everything you might want to learn from, but more importantly everyone can enjoy a well performed album, produced and brought to us with such care and attention.\nAt times Carlenos style reminded me of Greg Lakes acoustic work on his days with Emerson Lake and Palmer, it has a little light and shade, it has a little night and day, and a little shadow and sunlight about it and this last piece almost confirms that.\nOverall Perfect Imperfection is the type of album that should get a lot of airplay from radio, it will do from ours and it should completely take the listeners imagination to a place that will be a most pleasurable location. Dont miss out on this album; its a rare gem that glows brightly in a world that seems to have lost its musical soul.","classification":5,"fold":1}

All five so far have been all mixed from the multi-tracks by Steven Wilson with the approval of the band. The set is being released in two versions, either 3CDs and a Blu-ray disc or 2CDs and 2DVD-As. The  first two CDs contain a new stereo mix of the original album and two \"Dance Of The Dawn\" versions, the third \"Blu-Ray set only\" CD has an \"alternate version\" of the album, and 5 single edits. The alternate album is composed of the studio run-throughs of \"Dance Of The Dawn\" and \"Giants Under The Sun\" originally released on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/the-2003-Rhino-remastered-2CD-set\/dp\/B00007LTIA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">the 2003 Rhino remastered 2CD set<\/a>, an unreleased run-through of \"High The Memory,\" and a live version (Zurich, April 1974) of \"Ritual.\" A 2016 mix of the extended \"Dance Of The Dawn\" from the Rhino set is included as well. The first DVD-A contains the new stereo mix of the four original album tracks plus the extended \"Dance Of The Dawn\" in High Definition. The second DVD-A contains the same mixed for 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Surround Sound, along with a flat transfer of the original album from the master tape source. The Blu-Ray disc retains the content of both DVD-As along with a plethora of extras, including the \"alternate\" album version, the five single edits, new stereo instrumental mixes of the album tracks and extended \"Dance Of The Dawn\" in DTS-HD Master Audio, and two \"needle-drop\" vinyl transfers; from the original UK LP pressing and the US banded promo LP pressing. Whew...!\n\nTALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS, the group's sixth studio album, is considered by many the most controversial of the YES canon. Coming off the mega-selling CLOSE TO THE EDGE (#3US, #4UK), which featured just three tracks, including the side-long title cut, the band was blindsided by the departure of drummer Bill Bruford. Although an extremely gifted and popular member, Bruford was tired of the personal conflicts and the constant state of friction between him, singer Jon Anderson and bassist Chris Squire. When scouted by&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/KING-CRIMSON\/dp\/B00065MDSG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">KING CRIMSON<\/a>&nbsp;honcho Robert Fripp, who was putting together a new version of the titular groundbreaking progressive group, Bruford quickly bailed. With a world tour on the horizon, the band settled on Alan White, mostly known for his work with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/PLASTIC-ONO-BAND\/dp\/B000002UT9\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">PLASTIC ONO BAND<\/a>&nbsp;and on John Lennon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/IMAGINE\/dp\/B003Y8YXFS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">IMAGINE<\/a>, who had three-days to rehearse (!) before the tour commenced (most of the content of the band's next release, the live&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/YESSONGS\/dp\/B000002J1Y\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">YESSONGS<\/a>&nbsp;were recorded on said tour). During a stop in Tokyo during the tour, Jon Anderson was inspired to write a four-part epic based on a lengthy footnote within the book '<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Autobiography-Of-A-Yogi\/dp\/0876120796\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Autobiography Of A Yogi<\/a>' that described four \"shastras\" or treatises covering all aspects of religious and social life. Anderson approach guitarist Steve Howe with his idea, and when Howe agreed they began working on themes and instrumentation, conceiving the project as four side-long album tracks. Unfortunately keyboardist Rick Wakeman disagreed with the concept and musical direction, but agreed to finish the material, even though he considered it too avant-garde, bloated and padded. The songs were credited to Anderson and Howe, with music by YES. TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS  was the first YES album to utilize 24-track recording, although they had numerous issues with the equipment. Wakeman found himself often bored and spent a lot of time in a nearby pub playing darts. He also contributed to BLACK SABBATH's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/SABBATH-BLOODY-SABBATH\/dp\/B000002KET\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH<\/a>&nbsp;which was being recorded in an adjacent studio. A tour followed where the group performed the entire album live, which I'm proud to say I caught twice. Afterwards, Wakeman was the next to jump ship, onto a fairly successful solo career, rejoining YES on and off throughout the remaining years. Although panned by many critics, who held the album as an example of progressive-rock excess, it was a stunning commercial success. It was the first UK album to \"ship gold,\" and topped their charts for two weeks, in the US it made #6 and also certified gold (over 500,000 copies sold). The band toured behind the album from November 1973 to April 1974. The band also broke attendance records at the UK's Rainbow Theatre, selling out five consecutive nights, a rock band first.....\n\nThe set comes in two mini vinyl replica gatefold sleeves within a slipcase, at first the cover art looks the same on both, but on closer inspection the second has a subtle difference (I'll leave it for you to discover). The disc labels reproduce the record labels found in the original 2LP set, in both the original (Discs 1 & 2) and \"tweaked\" (Discs 3 & 4) versions. The booklet features new sleeve notes by Sid Smith along with portions of new interviews with Jon Anderson, Steve Howe and Alan White.  Besides rare photos and archive material the original artwork has been expanded, restored and approved by long-time YES illustrator Roger Dean. My only complaint is the lack of easily readable lyrics. Either an expanded booklet, a separate lyric booklet, or a mini-poster of the original (and beautiful) inner jacket is sorely needed.  As is you need a magnifying glass or your old LP to follow the lyrics, which are a major part of this masterwork, and enjoy the now minuscule inner artwork........\n\nTo quote Steven Wilson: \"I worked on and off for about 3 years on this new mix in my quest to do it justice. I hope it will satisfy the people who agree with me that it may just be Yes's pre-eminent masterpiece.\"\n\nAs with RELAYER, another dense recording, the added surround, center and subwoofer channels open the compositions wider, helping the listener to discern parts and themes buried in the conventional two-channel mix-down. I wish they had included a surround version of the instrumental mixes found on the Blu-ray, although the listener can again discern more from the absence of vocals, a 5.1 mix would've been the icing on an already delicious platter. Mirroring their genesis, all the tracks are credited lyrically to Anderson\/Howe, adding Squire to \"The Ancient \/ Giants Under The Sun.\" The music is credited to the entire band as well as the track \"The Remembering \/ High The Memory.\" Anderson and Howe felt TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS to be innovative and breaking new ground, whereas the critics let loose, some calling it the death-knell of progressive rock. . It's arguable that the architect of the album's sound-palate this go-round is Howe, who's playing throughout is stellar. Even though he has spoken bout his distaste of the opus, Rick Wakeman devised many unique and daring keyboard passages, providing the \"glue\" so to say, that binds of the disparate parts. One of the pluses of Steven Wilson's remix is the liberation of Chris Squire's bass, which seemed lost most of the time in the original mix. Surprisingly the MVP award goes to the new kid, drummer Alan White. To be thrown into the maelstrom of a mega-popular band's tour on three days notice while facing the prospect of contributing and recording four side-long compositions must've seemed daunting indeed! White not only acquits himself with a rock-solid steady base underlying the music, he also contributed melodies, a bridge and piano on \"Ritual.\" His finest moment however is leading the band during the astounding \"Ritual\" percussion break, the rarest of rock animals, a drum\/percussion solo that's not boring. The two outtakes of \"Dance Of The Dawn,\" basically live in the studio run-throughs, are terrific as well, and best exemplify the talent, genius and innate musicality of the band called YES......\n\nAll said, the remastering is stellar, the remix will depend on individual tastes. As with his remix of RELAYER, Wilson brings forth many passages, sounds and nuances buried in the original mix. Is it better? Well, while the 2003 Rhino remaster was great, hearing this prog monster in surround sound is a whole other ballgame. Wilson's remixes\/re-imaginings are always well done, you never sit there and think \"gee, this sounds lousy\" unless your a dyed-in-the-original-listened-to-it-2,000-times advocate for the original recording, which is also here as a \"flat transfer from the original tape source\" as well as needle-drops from the original UK LP and US Promo LP (the latter two Blu-Ray only).  I look on these YES remixes as a complimentary additions to the original recordings. Considering the length of TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS and the breadth of extra material you would have to spend many, many hours listening to and comparing the different versions to note the exact differences. I say, take it on it's own merits, and enjoy! Fans will definitely be pleased, and those either new to the album or critical in the past will have to judge it's merits. Me? Well anyone who has read my review of FRAGILE will note that I was disappointed that TALES was not the next release after RELAYER. You'll have to excuse me, I'm dying for a second\/third\/fourth listen......\n\nTRACK LIST:\nNew Stereo Mixes:\nCD 1:\n1. The Revealing Science Of God (Dance Of The Dawn) 20:18\n2.

{"text":"After a 3-year hiatus, RuPaul returns with another album.  His prior two albums, Champion and Glamazon, featured light, care-free dance tunes that just made you feel good.  Im happy to say that Born Naked continues this trend, only with more collaboration, more energy and more fierceness!  Ru and his long-time collaborator Lucian Piane have truly made something magical here.\n\nIn many ways, Born Naked is exactly what Ive always wanted from a RuPaul album.  There are no holds barred here, musically.  Champion and Glamazon were fantastic records as well, but the production on them seemed a little on the safe side.  The songs were fun, but didn't really experiment much.  Born Naked fixes this in spades.  Club-ready dance tracks explode with flair and charisma, the more hip-hop oriented tracks never lose momentum, and even the slow moments seem well-produced for the most part.\n\nMost unfortunately, the album doesnt really put its best foot forward at the start.  Freaky Money is a bit of an awkward start, sounding really similar to Rus prior single, Peanut Butter.  Its not a bad song by any stretch, but its not the best song to represent the album as a whole, so its placement as the first track is curious.  Geronimo (the first official single) also isn't representative of the album at all.  Its decent enough, but Ru is capable of better.  Finally, Can I Get An Amen?, which was featured in season 5 of RuPauls Drag Race as a singing challenge for the contestants, is a bit of a wasted opportunity.  Stripped down to just an acoustic guitar background, the song sounds simple and tender, but with each listen I feel the song deserves to truly flourishbut that never happens.\n\nBut apart from those three tracks, Born Naked is a tour-de-force!  Adrenaline deserves to be heard, period.  Easily the best song on this album, its harmonized vocals with a futuristic vibe is infectious, catchy and fantastic.  Modern Love is a song that demands being danced to at a packed club with lasers swirling above.  The instrumental breakdown after the chorus reminds of a bit of Daft Punk combined with Madeon, and its mesmerizing.  The brilliant Frankmusik makes a cameo on Fly Tonight, lending his soaring vocals to this soaring dance track.  Elation rules supreme here.  Let the Music Play features Rus best friend and co-judge on the show, Michelle Visage, and is a heartfelt dance ballad dedicated to their years of friendship.  Its a great moment on this album!  The record closes with Born Naked, a rock-flavored song thats not short on the camp factor.\n\nMight I point out, by the way, what a fantastic producer Lucian Piane is.  The amount of growth exhibited since Champion is extraordinary.  He has truly outdone himself and given Rus music a special dimension of sound that we haven't heard from him before.  Really, the worst thing that can be said about Born Naked is that at just under 39 minutes, its too short!  I really feel like I want more after the last track ends!\n\nTheres no shortage of fame or recognition for RuPaul, though after Champion, Glamazon, and now Born Naked, I really wish his musical endeavors got a little more exposure.  It deserves to be heard and recognized!  Buy this album!","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Dear Music Appreciators,\n\nIf music were clothing then Jason Isbells latest album would be like one of those favorite shirts.  You know, the one you reach for more than the others, the one that fits right and feels good - the one that doesnt go out of style.  SOMETHING MORE THAN FREE is a comfortable, well-made album that deserves some heavy rotation in the playlists of singer-songwriter appreciators everywhere.\n\nOpening track If It Takes a Lifetime would not sound too out of place on a late 70s Kenny Rogers album - and if you don't think thats a compliment then I don't know what to do with you.  Hudson Commodore could have been a hit for Eagles in their heyday.  Speed Trap Town evokes the best of NEBRASKA era Springsteen.\n\nDont put this one on to rock out.  Dont put this one on to dance.  Put this album on to think and reflect and question, to come to terms and plan and move forward somehow.  This music is good for staying up late, driving around, learning lyrics and singing a long.  Theres a lot of acoustic, mid-tempo shuffling stuff and the electric guitar flavors are used sparingly but to great effect on songs like 24 Frames, \"Children of Children, and Palmetto Rose.\n\nA strong sense of memory and character and story abounds on these songs, and theres plenty of conflict and regret, but theres also a feeling of purpose and potential for good.  Isbell asks questions (The Life You Chose) and he offers answers (24 Frames) and he sings about work like the grown-ass man that he is (If It Takes a Lifetime, Something More than Free).  Recently my 12-year old nephew declared that I didn't like the same kind of music he did because he was into singer-songwriter.  He offered 17-year old internet discovery Shawn Mendes as an example of a singer-songwriter he was into.  Ive got nothing against Shawn Mendes, nephew, but hopefully someday youll learn to think of someone like Jason Isbell instead, because SOMETHING MORE THAN FREE is what real man singing and songwriting is all about.\n\nSincerely,\n\nConstant Listener","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"TVOTR is one of the few newer bands I follow actively. I discovered them after the release of Dear Science, which sounded truly groundbreaking to my ears.  Here were these guys who were my age and grew up with the same music I did (80s synth-pop and alt-rock), who took those influences someplace truly new and different.  Dear Science was \"experimental\" in the way it combined sounds and ideas from the past and present into something that sounded immediate and had its own very unique character. My appreciation for that album only grew over the years.  Their next one, Nine Types of Light, was also great in that same groundbreaking way but sounded more introverted and reflective even at its harder-rocking moments.  Then nothing from this band for a few years and I wondered where they had gone.\n\nSo now TVOTR is back with an album that reminds me instantly how ahead of the pack they are.  The songs are, as other reviewers point out, less overtly experimental than some of the earlier work.  But the songwriting is just as strong as ever and feels more direct with some of the complexity removed.  The music seems more soulful now, with a greater emphasis on vocal harmony. Of course there's still the electronic backdrop and edgy guitar parts, but it all balances well to place the emphasis on the songs themselves.  There isn't a bad track here but so far my favorite is Careful You.\n\nThis is certainly worth buying if you have been following TVOTR or want to hear some very modern sounds and interesting ideas.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Solo projects always result in the inevitable comparison to the band from which they originally became famous. In the case of Julian Casablancas, that original band is The Strokes. Casablancas, The Strokes' lead singer and songwriter, clearly took his time coming out with his own material. Albert Hammond Jr., The Strokes' rhythm guitarist released his first solo album in 2006 and has released a second album since. Nikolai Fraiture, the bassist for The Strokes, released his debut album with his side project, Nickel Eye, in January of this year. Even the drummer, Fabrizio Moretti, has done some side work with the band Little Joy. That being said, it's almost unheard of for the lead singer and guitarist of a band to be the last to release a solo record.\n\nSo the real question is: \"was it worth the wait?\" For anyone expecting a fourth Strokes album, the answer is no. For the open minded musical manipulative minds that appreciate Thom Yorke's solo work almost as much as Radiohead, this album is certainly worth a listen. The album opens up with \"Out of the Blue,\" a track that maintains a Strokes feel while taking more chances lyrically. Following that is \"Left Right in the Dark\" which opens with hints of what's to come including synthesizer, but ends up evolving into another song that could be a believable B-side for The Strokes. Perhaps Casablancas was looking for an easy way to lure fans of The Strokes into listening to his new material because from there, the Strokes style is nearly gone with the exception of Casablancas' signature vocals complete with effects matching those used with his original band.\n\nThe second half of Phrazes for the Young often plays like a Strokes and Beck collaboration. Things don't really get too crazy until track five with \"Ludlow Street.\" A little bit country, a little bit rock `n' roll, \"Ludlow Street\" throws in brass, off beat hand claps, banjo, the high pitched rotating effect of a Leslie speaker, a drum machine, and a handful of other effects. Two tracks later, the song \"Glass\" clearly takes its name from the most prominent instrument on the song.\n\nJulian Casablancas clearly made an effort to stray from the styles of his original band and the result is fairly successful. The Strokes' influences are still present at times, but Casablancas' solo effort is unique. Now that each member of The Strokes has released an album with a side project, fans might find it interesting to give each album released during the Strokes' hiatus a listen to hear where each member has contributed their own style to their original collaboration.\n\nSimilar Artists: The Strokes, Jet, Franz Ferdinand\n\nTrack Suggestion: Glass","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"I was a big fan of Brian Tyler's score for \"Iron Man 3\", so I was happy that he was continuing his collaboration with Marvel to work on \"Thor: The Dark World\".  I also enjoyed Patrick Doyle's work on the original \"Thor\" film, and was looking forward to hearing what new music the sequel would bring.  It seems that for \"The Dark World\", Tyler has produced a similar style and tone; although those who like continuity in film franchises might be a little disappointed, because I didn't hear any specific themes from the first film re-used here.\n\nThe music has a lot of great action cues that will add to the fun of those sequences in the movie - fortunately, the music is also great to listen to on its own.  There are also some tracks that skillfully use vocals, the most memorable of which is \"Lockasenna\" [Track 2].  I always enjoy the use of choral elements in soundtracks, and it feels very appropriate here given the larger-than-life nature of this story about gods and other worlds.\n\nOverall, I think \"Thor: The Dark World\" is a great soundtrack that's surpasses the original \"Thor\" album - although both are definitely worth a listen.  This is the second great score from Brian Tyler in 2013, and \"The Dark World\" is among the best scores for a Marvel Studios film to date.\n\nThe one other thing to mention is that this film is the first to feature just the Marvel Studios logo at the front (no Disney, Paramount, etc).  As such, the logo has been expanded and Tyler was asked to create a full 30-second fanfare - this music is included on \"The Dark World\" album, and is likely to be heard at the beginning of every future Marvel Studios film.\n\nFavorite Tracks\n[1] Thor: The Dark World\n[2] Lockasenna\n[24] As the Hammer Falls","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"When I was 11 years old(1967) I attended a Monkees concert on this tour,and certainly,these 4 concerts are true to what I remember hearing at The Miami Beach Convention Hall(yes,I was at one of the 6 shows where Jimi Hendrix was one of the warmup acts).What you get in this 4 disc set are 3 concerts professionally recorded on 4-track by RCA engineer Hank Cicalo and one mono soundboard tape from Mobile,Alabama recorded by one of the group's roadies. The Mobile tape sounds somewhat better here than on bootleg editions. The primary fault is with the group's performances. As we all know,the Monkees were singer\/actors hired to portray musicians,and on the group's first 2 studio albums,98% of the instruments were played by sessionmen. Even if Mickey Dolenz(Drums),Mike Nesmith(guitar),Peter Tork(Bass,electric piano.organ) & Davy Jones(tambourine) had been better players,they were in a no-win situation,trying to play songs from the first 2 albums,which featured up to 10 instruments per song. Typical Monkees fans would be best advised to buy Rhino's \"Live 1967\" CD,which creates one ideal set from the three professionally recorded shows(all the shows had the same song line-ups).For those who do purchase this 4-CD set,you'll note that none of the selections in the 3 professionally recorded shows match exactly with the recordings as heard on \"Live 1967\".I suspect that on \"Live 1967\",that Rhino engineers(who had access to 3 renditions of each songs) spliced between renditions,used sampling,or (perhaps) had The Monkees come into the studio to overdub\/correct the recordings. What you'll get if you buy this set is the REAL(not particularly listenable!) ragged\/amateur\/garage band sound of The Monkees circa 1967,albeit lovingly packaged by Rhino Handmade. But \"Live 1967\" is much more listenable.","classification":2,"fold":1}

{"text":"How do you describe this band to folks who have never seen them? Let's see, they write and sing songs in sing songs in French, Italian, Spanish and English. They sound like 50s cocktail music sometimes and like 90s jazz sometimes. The two lead members both went to Harvard and the composer\/pianist is a musical genius. And they come from, of all places, Portland, Oregon!\n\nThe only way to really explain them is to play a few tracks from their CDs.. or better yet... see them LIVE in concert (nearly all of which seem to sell out!).\n\nThis is their fourth album and the word continues to spread. I was anxiously awaiting this disc and am not disappointed! (Well, maybe because of two tracks .... more on that in a minute). All the elements of their previous albums are there from the multi-lingual songs crafted by either lead singer China Forbes or collaborator Alex Marashian (who is responsible for 5 of the 13 songs here) to the great arrangements by co-leader Thomas Lauderdale. Though a couple of songs are sung in languages other than English (the translations are included in the booklet included.).\n\nI really hated to drop my rating to a 4 but there are two tracks that seemed out of place. It was great that they got the staff in their office to join in on the track \"Sing\" (the Sesame Street\/Carpenters song), but the song is so saccharine that even PM can't make it palatable on repeated listening. The other track that doesn't work as well is \"Piensa en m\", where 90 year old Mexican singer Chavela Vargas (artist Frida Kahlo's lover) provides the vocals. Her aged voice is a far cry from the dulcet tones of China Forbes and the musical flow stops when she follows the \"Sing: track. All is well, though when the lyrically brief (just two verses) \"New Amsterdam\" closes out the disc, before a reprise of the lead off \"Ninna nanna\".\n\nThough not my favorite PM CD, its heads above much of the other music out there. Pink Martini fans will definitely want this disc (while waiting anxiously for the next), and it's a good intro to those yet to discover the \"musical magic\" of the band.\n\nSteve Ramm\n\"Anything Phonographic\"","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"There isn't all that much new that you can say about Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" that hasn't already been said. So this review is more like a review\/essay.\n\nThe hype and mystique surrounding this album is all true. It did change the face of rock, and along with Pearl Jam's \"Ten\" was the songbook that most popular 90s bands borrowed from.\n\nSo much has been written about Kurt Cobain, his life, his suicide, Courtney, Courtney\/Grohl feud, etc., that's it's easy to forget what all started the hype in the first place. Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" is undoubtedly one of the greatest rock albums of-all-time. From the classic intro of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" to the subdued closing \"Something In the Way,\" every song is both instantly memorable and brilliant. There isn't a single bad song on this disc. \"Nevermind\" is like a greatest hits in of itself.\n\nWhat made this album so great was that the music was punk, but also had a pop-sensibility with infectious hooks and killer riffs. In this sense, you kind of get the best of both worlds--the raw anger and energy of Black Flag, and The Dead Kennedy's, but also the melody and harmony of The Beatles.\n\nIf you were born shortly before or after the death of Kurt Cobain, it's hard to imagine how revolutionary this CD was. When \"Nevermind\" exploded, it drew the line in rock. Bands that were otherwise obscure (Mudhoney, L7, Screaming Trees) were signed to major labels and enjoyed radio-play. Alternative bands that had been around for a few years that were already signed (Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins, Alice In Chains) became huge overnight. The early 90s was a really exciting time in rock. Radio had been infested with the likes of Slaughter and Trixter, and, for a while, everything was new and fresh.\n\nThe only real drawback for me is that the revolution of \"Nevermind\" made people close minded about bands they had only just recently loved. Although it is a blessing that some of these bands were shown the door, i.e., Slaughter, a lot of good bands were discarded and trashed rightfully or not. \"Nevermind\" was certainly the death nail to all old-school rock. Most of these bands were killed overnight.\n\nIn conclusion, fourteen years after its release, \"Nevermind\" often emulated, never duplicated, is still one of the best albums of all-time and belongs in every rock collection.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Gareth is a very nice man, but this soundtrack was, unfortunately, a great disappointment to me.  The main theme recurrent throughout most of the tracks was very similar to the main theme that Masashi Hamauzu used for his Final Fantasy XIII soundtrack.  Although somewhat beautiful, the Ori theme so heavily recalled Hamauzu's earlier work that I was unable to enjoy it.  The tracks seemed like remixes of FF13's \"The Promise\" and \"Serah's Theme,\" and it was impossible to dissociate one from the other.\n\nIf Gareth did this by accident, having never been aware of Hamauzu's work, what a dreadful happenstance!  I hope such a mistake never happens to him again--no doubt many composers worry that they might inadvertently seem to be plagiarizing, when they really were not doing so.","classification":2,"fold":1}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.

{"text":"The entrance to Paul Simon's latest creation with \"The Werewolf\" shows his wit to be as sharp as it's ever been. The music to this song is as stunning as anything he's ever written. It opens with an Indian instrument called the gopichand (unknown to me) and it makes you do an about face. It's unsettling, just like its violent lyrics. Though \"The Werewolf\" (and most of the album) is percussive, when the pipe organ creeps in, the song's deathly feel is manifest.\n\nIn \"Street Angel\" and \"In a Parade\", Simon faces a social taboo with raw emotion. They're both subjects of the same homeless person. The fine melodies give service to their great rhythms. Again, percussion effects dominate here. With \"Street Angel\", the character has something to latch on to, but on \"In a Parade\" he checks into the ER with total absence of a vision. These two cuts could have made for one of the most tough-minded concept seven-inch singles.\n\nThe wonderful \"Cool Papa Bell\" is musically upbeat in the \"Graceland\" tradition of the fastest baseball player in the pre-Jackie Robinson era. The profanity in the song is subtly sung.\n\nSimon still embraces his melodic folk roots. The two highlights are a sweet, brief instrumental entitled \"In the Garden of Edie\" , which is dedicated to his wife. The other is the closer, \"Insomniac's Lullaby\". This last song has two instruments I'd never heard of; the zoomoozophone and the chromelodeon. Maybe these instruments sound odd but every sound is layered oh so right. It's Simon's more halcyon death song than \"The Werewolf\".\n\nThe only thing predictable about Simon is that he spaces his studio albums by half a decade. There's nothing beyond the realm of possibility in him finding sonic surprise. Most of this music offers that evidence.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"The beauty of Apple Records was not that it was just another stream of Beatles revenue, it was a representation of the Beatles idealization in which anything was welcomed. The musical contents in this tribute to the coolest \"independent\" label that's ever existed spans a four-year period. Some of the pop, such as Jackie Lomax or Ronnie Spector, is pleasant but pedestrian, especially compared to their flagship model. But only the two worst offenders, Trash's \"Golden Slumbers-Carry That Weight\" and Lon and Derrek van Eaton's \"Sweet Music\" are in serious need of fumigation. The Radha Krishna Temple is boring, yet I'm torn over it because this is an integral part to what Apple stood for. And if Billy Preston's version of \"My Sweet Lord\" is slightly bland, it's easy to be overcome by his other gospel tune, the joyous \"That's the Way God Planned It\" - love it!\n\nBest in the pack include two surprise first-time pleasures: Brute Force's \"King of Fuh\" is a novelty worthy of Harry Nilsson's \"Coconut\" and Hot Chocolate's \"Give Peace A Chance\" is an English reggae even more thoughtful than the original. Not to be outdone are two great ones that are well known. The whimsical-folk, \"Those Were the Days\", is still impressive in its recollection. \"Day After Day\", by Beatles imitators Badfinger, is the greatest Beatles imitation to hit AM radio since the Knickerbockers 1965 smash, \"Lies\". Their \"Come and Get It\" is essential to this company too.\n\nIt can be argued this is strictly a hodgepodge, but I like how much of this pulls together under a vision. Unfortunately, this well-meaninged label wouldn't last for long, but it succeeded in opening channels for many different styles of music. More interestingly, the Beatles individually and as a group are explicitly acknowledged in the music.","classification":4,"fold":1}

I wasn't disappointed.\n\nUnlike the first two, this one only had two songs I was familiar with.  The \"In Christ Alone\" medley takes the recent praise chorus and combines it with the chorus to the song of the same name made famous by Michael English.  I was surprised to learn that Shawn Craig had written the song before the group formed.  The other song is \"Wonderful Merciful Savior.\"  I've recently learned this great chorus, and their version of it is outstanding.\n\nAs with previous projects, the guys contribute a couple songs of their own.  \"Because I'm Forgiven\" focuses on the reason we praise God.  \"Be the Praise of My Heart\" recognizes that true worship comes from every action of our lives and not just the songs we sing.  \"Awake My Soul\" is a prayer to be surrendered to God and become more like Him.  Finally, \"Mighty is the Power of the Cross\" reflects on what was done for us on the cross.\n\nThe rest of the songs are great as well.  The CD opens with \"Friend of God,\" a joyful song about the mind-blowing idea that the God of the universe calls us friend.  I actually heard \"You are God Alone\" on the radio before I got the CD and couldn't wait to get my own copy.\n\nEvery song on this CD focuses praise on God for all He's done for us and who He is.

It is full of well-crafted songs with strong lyrics that detail the rockier side of love.  Cole has one of the strongest vocals in R&B, and they are well displayed here.  Cole is no Mary J Blige, but comes close.\n\n\"Woman To Woman\" is R&B with no strings attached.

It has a strong hip-hop beat and hot guest spot by Lil' Wayne.  Some of the other stronger tracks are \"Zero\", \"Missing Me\", the ballad and second single \"Trust and Believe\", \"Woman To Woman\", and \"Wonderland\".

{"text":"The first time I listened to The XX's eponymous debut album, it was hard to not be excited about the band's future.  From start to finish, the record was excellent - the band used minimal instrumentation to create quiet, moody atmospheres to let their songs dwell in.  Most notably, the two vocalists, Oliver Sims and Romy Madley Croft, carried the album with their soft duets - their voices would rarely rise above a murmur, but together they were able to evoke heartwarming love or heartbreaking pain.  After a handful of years, The XX is back with COEXIST, an album that picks up right where the band left off.\n\nThe band has largely preserved their sound even with the departure of guitarist Baria Qureshi who left in 2009.  Qureshi, who left in 2009 due to personal differences, was not replaced, and the band has moved forward as a 3-piece.  Unfortunately, the prominent guitarwork that made songs like \"Untitled\" and \"Crystalised\" so irresistible is missing on COEXIST, but the band is able to compensate for this absence through other means.\n\nMost of the COEXIST's music is created with minimal instrumentation and a touch of reverb; every now and then, new instruments enter the fold, notably a steel drum (\"Reunion\"). The album starts off with \"Angels.\"  It's the album's lead single, and the song is surprisingly bare - Madley Croft's vocals are complimented by spare instrumentation, but the song relies completely on her voice to sell it.  Not only does this track set the tone for COEXIST, but it's one of the highlights on the album.  \"Chained\" introduces slightly more instrumentation, but not much - the album rarely rises above a whisper.  The following track, \"Fiction,\" is another one of the album's best: it's held together with a nice electronic beat that doesn't really change throughout its running time, but it offers Sims a nice opportunity to create a brilliant melody.  There are times when songs' rhythms edge towards dance-territory (\"Sunset\" or \"Swept Away\" for example), but the album never feels cheap or pandering with its pulsating beats.  \"Tides\" makes use of a funky groove and guitar accompaniment.  The final song, \"Our Song\" features a duet over a slightly dissonant loop, it features a similar cadence to \"Angels,\" so the album begs to be put on repeat.  It's a good song to end the album, but for me, it was one of the weaker standalone tracks.\n\nI think it would be remiss to talk about this album without spending a little time on the lyrics.  There are moments on COEXIST when the vocalists paint beautiful imagery with their words.  Most of the subject material involves lovers pining over one another or confessing their love for the other - it all works with the perfect delivery of the vocalists.  In \"Angels:\" when describing her love-interest, Madley Croft sings \"if someone believed me, they would be in as love with you as I am.\"  In \"Fiction:\" \"I wake up alone, with only daylight between us\/ Last night the world was beneath us.\"  In \"Our Song: \"And there's no one else \/ that knows me \/ like you do... The walls I \/ hide behind \/ you walk through \/ you just walk through.\"\n\nPound for pound, I don't think I enjoyed COEXIST as much as the self-titled album (which would hard to top for anyone), but it's certainly worth checking out.  Listeners that enjoyed THE XX should seek out this album; I would recommend this album to listeners unfamiliar with the band as well.

{"text":"Back in 1968, rock was in clubs, not areans. After the bands had finished their sets, late night jams were routine labratories. Hendrix, Jefforson Airplane, all the bands now in the pantheon hanging out and playing.\n\nThis album is gives you a good idea of what this sounded like. Super Session is Al Kooper, Mike Bloomfield and Stephan Stills, backed by one of  the most underrated bassists of the era, Electric Flag's Harvey Brooks. (Bloomfield was in the same band.)\n\nOn the bill are blues jams, a few Kooper tunes, and a  fantastic jam on \"Season Of The Which\" by Donovan. These are the best players, and the jams have the craft of most studio albums.\n\nBloomfield and Stills have very dfferent approaches to the guitar, and listening to the differences are one of the many perks to this album.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Jill Barber's voice is rich, soothing, and full of vibrato, with a bit of a nasal quality. The overall character of \"Never Quit Lovin' You\" is a blues-style torch song with a bit of a country twang thrown in.\n\nThe song has a soft duet staccato (plucky) introduction that continues through the first verse, grows into a song with back-up singers, and then swells into a louder full orchestra strings countermelody.  The duet is brought back at the end and continues through the fade out. This is a very interesting effect.  The song plays out as if she is sharing private thoughts when the introduction is playing; followed by sharing her excitement with close friends; then a public declaration of love when the full orchestra takes over; and finally fading back into her private thoughts.  Very nicely done!\n\nUpdate 12\/16\/12:\n\nIf you enjoyed this song, you would probably enjoy Jill Barber's other albums.

{"text":"The Von Bondies and their song \"C'mon, C'mon\" is the first band and song that I researched AFTER my purchase. Having read a little about them I'm not surprised to find out that they are an alternative band formed in the late 90's. \"C'mon, C'mon\" has all the features that attract me to alternative music (I do not claim to be an music expert and many times I do not follow bands, I simply go by what I like and my own interpretations of the music--if you listen long enough you're able to identify the rock, punk, and even some 70's sounds in  many songs that are considered or identified as alternative). For me at least, the influence of good old fashioned well known punk bands, like the Clash and American punk like the Ramones is clear even in \"C'mon, C'mon\"--probably one of the reasons why I liked it and bought it.\n\nI did not know that \"C'mon C'mon\" was used as the opening music for the TV show \"Rescue Me\" but this is besides the point. I have no idea what the lyrics mean and are beyond the scope of my review. However, they're simple enough, I've caught myself singing to this song and I usually don't sing. I love that anthem sound that is so particular of alternative music (also punk, yes?). In some crazy way, it reminds me of the Clash's \"Police on my back.\" Crazy, but that's what it reminds me of.\n\nI've given \"C'mon C'mon\" five stars because I'm very happy with my purchase. The worst I can say about this song is that when typing it out, it's an awkward contraction and spell check doesn't recognize it.","classification":5,"fold":1}

(It was my 17 yr. daughter who introduced me to her, incidentally). This live EP was recorded on the YS Fall 06 tour.\n\n\"EP\" (3 tracks, 24 min.) brings a new song, \"Colleen\", which is pretty much in the vein of the \"YS\" album. Next is \"Clam, Crab, Cockle, Cowrie\", from \"The Milk-Eyed Mender\" album, in a slightly altered version from the album. Then comes a 13 min. blow-out version of \"Cosmia\", from the \"YS\" album, which here live sounds much more invigerated than the album version, and I can't stop playing it.\n\nIf you are familiar with Joanna Newsome, this is a great companion to the \"YS\" album. If you are new, this is the prefect introduction to her sound, and I highly recommed checking it out for those of you.

{"text":"The past few years have really brought out anew for pop star Amy Grant. She had moved back into her Christian roots well with her core audience, but unfortunate, she hasn't been able to click with newer music buyers. Since her A&M catalog was recently moved over to EMI, on her label Sparrow. While so many acts have done well with a new label in catalog sales, Amy still has a long way to return to the success she had a long time ago. A few years ago, it was well said with her previous hits package Greatest Hits 1986-2004 which did very well with the actual appeal. Now that she has another hits package, does Amy Grant really have the appeal she once conquered with record buyers?\n\nAmy Grant's 2007 Greatest Hits mixes in a bit of the old and the new that Amy had delivered well from her 90's pop mix, to her contemporary mixes of soul and Christian music. The songs have been remastered nicely, and tries to deliver nicely as a re-introduction to Amy to a whole new audience. The collection includes some of her great gems like Every Heartbeat and Baby Baby, to her contemporary Christian classics like Lead Me On and Father's Eyes. While the collection works fairly well for new fans, it misses a few great songs from her pop era that worked better from her previous hits package. The collection overlooks a few great tracks like The Next Time I Fall, her often overlooked duet with former Chicago singer Peter Cetera, as well as The Things We Do For Love, which she did for the Ellen Degeneres film Mr. Wrong, and her delightful cover of Joni Mitchell's Big Yellow Taxi from House Of Love, which had a very colorful video, and a better beat than when Joni recorded it years ago.\n\nAll in all, Amy Grant's Greatest Hits isn't a bad collection though, but it just doesn't deliver like the A&M days really did, or her previous Greatest Hits 1986-2004 album, which unfortunately is no longer in print. Hopefully, there could be a better hits collection that could attract Amy's great pop days like that one did, but this one could've had more to be desired, and that makes it a missed heartbeat.\n\nAlbum Cover: B\n\nSongs: C\n\nPrice: C+\n\nRemastering: B-\n\nOverall: C 1\/2+","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"One crucial element that sets this apart from her debut&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Acoustic-Soul\/dp\/B00005A1PR\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Acoustic Soul<\/a>&nbsp;a year earlier is that...somehow the sound is very much more fully formed in many ways. Wheras the sound of the debut generally emphasized the artists \"naturalness\" this blends India's \"acoustic soul\" sound with a array of soundscapes,many of which are as equally funky and soulful.\"Little Things\" is an excellent example. It's groove,the heavy-on-easy style and unique chord changes could only come from the guy who produced her debut:Stevie Wonder. Just about all of the music here maintains his signiture writing style as well,even though India is more fully in charge of the production here. The lyrics are typically \"power of positive thinking\" but the wonderful thing about them is that India's great attitude and the sincerity and brilliance of her poetry really forgive any possibility for a clishe. Needless the say the moments when this album really catches fire are when the tempo goes up a little such as on the excellent \"Slow Down\",\"Can I Walk With You\" and the bonus cut \"Interested\"-all rollicking soul tunes then endow her formula with a lot of rhythmic strengh. Of course that doesn't dismiss the respectful tone of \"Talk To You\",\"Complicated Melody\" and \"Headed In The Right Direction\". The only song that confuses me a little here,where I love the lush music is \"God Is Real\". I realize the connection in the black community to Christianity runs deep and is significant but for the life of me I cannot tell if this song is advertising India's obvious Christian faith or if her intention is to point out that nature in itself is godly. Not being religious myself these kinds of ambiguous lyrics are always mildly curious to me. So while this album really serves mostly to establish that her huge success with the debut wasn't some kind of post millenium fluke this was really the last time,musically anyway India. Arie would have anything to prove.","classification":5,"fold":1}

Perhaps if Dylan had gotten someone to produce the album there may have been a bit more spark to it.\nI know Dylan is famed for releasing music constantly goes against the grain of what critics & fans expect, but for such a prominent songwriter its just a little frustrating that weve got another covers record.\nSo not a bad album, but if weren't the biggest fan of Shadow.., then Fallen Angles problem isn't going to float your boat to much.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"It surprises me when someone who has a great talent, can make a very fair song. Jill Scott has made so many great songs in her career like Golden and A Long Walk. But the past several years have been hard for her, leaving her work Sony and heading for a new label, a marriage dissolving, and trying to find her feet again with her work. Yet, it is very hard for her to try and sample a classic song and make it better. She did it very well, when she sampled Shirley & Company's Shame, Shame, Shame for her hit Shame a few years ago. Now, to take on a classic from a true legend, well it is a gamble, but in this case it does not work that well. Back Together is a fair song, taking on a sample of the great Aretha Franklin on her hit Natural Woman. I found the song to be fair, but didn't bring out anything to ignite and for Jill to make her own. Aretha had been remarkable, but for Jill it feels incredibly weak, and not anything worth its while. It is alright, but I found this song to be weaker than her song Fool's Gold, which worked well for her. I do hope there are better songs from Jill down the road.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"If there is honestly one thing that I do adore about Sting, is that has been a master artist at really making great songs on his own. He has been doing it for 30 years on his own, and nearly 40 years as a part of The Police. I do however find his solo work to really deliver nicely from Jazz and Soul to all the way to Rock. But when he has a song come out, people will really listen to him, most of the time. When it came down to his Brand New Day album in 1999, many people weren't very eager at listening to the album at first, after the title track was released. However when Desert Rose was released as a single, many people really flocked over to the album. Desert Rose from the Brand New Day album is one of those hypnotic songs of Sting's that is soulful and very hypnotic to his work. I definitely think it is one of his Top 5 songs to have ever came out in the 90's. Next to If I Ever Lose Me Faith In You and Fields Of Gold. This is one song that I definitely recommend downloading if you are a Sting fan.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"As a radio single, this song was a passing car you had though you saw a million times in the form of Backstreet Boys and the like. But as radio versions usually do, it doesn't give justice to the album version. And like the special edition of The Abyss, some things are better extended.\n\nLike I said, about the first four minutes of the song sound like a boy band reject song. It has good vocals, less than original lyrics and beat, and although it's not as bad as most of the stuff out there, it's kind of a passing song. Easily forgettable.\n\nBut get into the extended portion, and you get more lovely instrumental intrudes, and just general expansion that could be a considered a deleted scene in the movie world. And while it may not be much, it is a nice addition.\n\nOverall, some stuff is better longer, and some stuff can't be short enough. This song is helped by the length, and makes the song sound fuller. Still not totally amazing, but still pretty good. Justin still has a long way to come around before he becomes amazing.

{"text":"This is a wonderful album and absolute perfection from beginning to end and the extra tracks are a nice addition as well.  The original Wailers were such an influential band and one of the precious few who while changing the music scene also managed to change culture as a whole.  I've always thought Mr. Marley was the truest poet in music due to the fact that he lived every song he ever wrote as did his primary co-songwriters, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.  Their music and lyrical content stired up revolution both in their country, in music and in the hearts and minds of people around the globe.  This is one band that still generates a tremendous buzz today years after the release of this fantastic album.\n\nThey weren't the first to write, produce & perform reggae (Music of the Islands) but they did bring a cohesiveness to their genre and showed that, by this time, it had matured into a force just like the other top genre's of the day.  The Wailers also were able to seemlessly blend aspects from R&B, Jazz, Gospel and Blues bringing a different and unique flavor.  The Wailers, along with Jimmy Cliff, were truly the 1st to make us stand up and pay attention to Reggae and what it would soon mean on a world wide scale!  I recenly ran across an online poll that asked a simply yet profound question. \"Who was more influential: Bob Marley or John Lennon?\"  There were a variety of opinons one way or the other, as you would expect, and the debate got somewhat heated.  However, the final response given by a participant on the forum was one of the most profound I've heard on the subject and I think sums everything up in a nutshell.\n\nHe stated about the two artists in question: \"One wrote and performed a lot of hit songs, ended a war single handedly, and is looked at to some in Africa as the second coming.\"  \"The other wrote and performed a lot of hit songs, Enough Said!\"  I couldn't have said it any better myself and that is the difference between The Wailers and every other band of any influence, their songs touched people on a level that made them want to get up, stand up and fight for their rights, not just sing, dance, go to parties, etc.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with the latter, however, it's the former that truly makes a difference in the direction of a people and nation.\n\nListening to this CD really took me back to that first moment when I heard this album.  Putting needle to wax and hearing \"Get Up, Stand Up, Stand Up for your rights!\" come shouting through my speakers absolutely sent chills down my spine.  Understand the time frame, this was 1973 and the Civil Rights\/Black Power movements were still raging in the U.S., to hear a band sing a song like that was so mind boggling to my young ears.  Radio stations weren't prone to play such revolutionary themes at the time and especially from a genre that was just making a name for itself on a worldwide scale.  Then you had the sweet and angelic sounds of Bunny Wailer's \"Hallelujah Time\" with it's wonderful bass guitar and clavinet intro.  This song is so powerful in that it reminds you of the beauty of the simple things in life in the midst of such gross oppression.\n\nThen you have the ultimate song of rebellion and revolution, a song that would become an anthem of both Reggae & Revolutions around the globe, Bob Marley's masterpiece \"I Shot The Sheriff.\"  What can be said about this song that has not already been stated millions of times over.  It has so many layers and displays Marley's incredible mastery of writing and storytelling using allegories and metaphors.  At the same time it's a song about an individual and a nation of people defending their right to live in peace according to their beliefs & fighting against genocide of a \"seed\" planted.\n\nThere's a wonderful interplay of songs as Reggae is music of what I call equal opposites.  This is displayed constantly in the writings of Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.  From songs like \"Burnin' and Lootin'\" to \"Put It On\" and \"Duppy Conqueror\" to \"Reincarnated Souls.\"  All 3 men were able to, at the same time, be revolutionary and spiritual, fighers and lovers, Rastafarians and Rebels as they saw one as the other and all inclusive.  The songs they wrote were both complex yet simple, deep with practial meanings and applications for everyday life for everyday people.\n\nJust like there's a postive for a negative and an up for a down a left for a right, Reggae music deals with the entire spectrum of life.  This music is so very deep and personal, it truly gives you a glimpse as to what it was like in Jamaica back in the time The Wailers first formed and the strife and struggles they had to go through and not just there but in all the Island nations and anywhere were those of African descent were living around the world.  This was the music that changed generational perspectives and was, then and now, adored by millions and millions of people around the world.\n\nWhen you have fans as varied as the Freedom Fighers from both South Africa & Zimbabwe, The Hopi & Havasupai Indians of the Southwest U.S.A, The Maoris of New Zealand & even the United Nations, there's really not much to argue about concerning how broad and vast your influence has become.

{"text":"ARC OF A DIVER is Steve Winwood's masterpiece. Many of the songs cut a lot deeper than their pop veneer would indicate on first listen, including, especially, the opening cut, \"While You See A Chance\", which tells people not to let opportunities pass them by, and the title track, which is about how hard connecting with others can be. Winwood's belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 for drug-smuggling was unjustly convicted makes even disco pap like \"Second Hand Woman\" and \"Spanish Dancer\" bearable, and results in ARC OF A DIVER being an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.","classification":5,"fold":1}

Copying Irreplaceable's beat almost completely was a terrible thing to do! Not original and we had ENOUGH of that song. That's what this song TOTALLY rides on! At least Chris Brown, even though it's a similar beat, has something going for his song, With You (better lyrics, nice video).\n\nAltogether, I just don't appreciate either of them ripping the Irreplaceable beat off though.\n\nCome on!

The impact of that album was tremendous.

Whenever the name Pink Floyd comes up, I genuinely feel nothing but utmost respect for this band who has remained consistent throughout their 49-year course, showcasing unique talent and vision in their discography, and exhibiting integrity like very few other bands have. \"The endless river\", athough featuring mostly instrumental pieces, presents everything that defines Pink Floyd: it is psychedelic, ambitious, emotional, haunting, occasionally self-indulgent, ultimately distinctive. As this is their final record, I am excited to be able to enjoy the first new Pink Floyd album in 20 years, hoping that, in another 20 years from now, I will be reminiscing about the past, thinking about how excited I am feeling now, just like I did back in 1994.","classification":4,"fold":1}

For example, I was very disappointed with Billy Joel's version of the classic \"Wichita Lineman.\" I just don't think he was the right choice for that tune. Much, much better was Lucinda Williams joining Webb on \"Galveston\" and Jackson Browne's vocals on \"P.F. Sloane.\" The Willie Nelson and Mark Knopfler tracks are also quite good.

{"text":"This one has to be Alice's most inconsistent albums.  It's material ranges all over the place seemingly in search of a direction, but not really finding one.  Cooper appears on the back cover with slicked back short hair, long sleeved dress shirt and a tie.  A complete 360 from his para military character from his last incarnation on \"Special Forces\".  This is another short one only being around 30 minutes long.  Album sales were close to rock bottom by this time with the album not even charting.  I did hear \"I Like Girls\" on my local AOR station a few times, but that was about it.  Although it gets panned by a lot of Cooper heads, I like a lot of this disc.  You get the feeling that Cooper is just having fun with a lot of this stuff, as much of the album is very light hearted and humorous.  Highlights include \"Zorro's Ascent\" a song about Alice Cooper as Zorro.  How he thought up this one I'll never know, but it is funny and cleaver.  Three songs in the middle all run together \"Adaptable\", \"I Like Girls\", and \"Remarkably Insincere\".  They are all short punchy rock songs with funny lyrics.  \"Tag You're It\" sees Alice as a horror movie director.......or is he really a killer?  This is a great song and harkens back to his \"Welcome To My Nightmare\" days.  \"It Better Be Good\" is another short fun rocker. On the other side of the coin there is some pretty dreadful stuff on this album as well.  \"I Am The Future\" sounds like it is from the cheesy movie soundtrack where it originated.  \"No Baloney Homosapiens\" is, well just look at the title and you can pretty much guess.  \"I'm Alive\" is another clunker that closes out the album.  Alice did not even tour around this album and it came and went pretty quickly.  Still, I like most of it and it is defiantly one of Cooper's most \"fun\" albums.","classification":3,"fold":1}

Now with the two of them coming to a close as husband and wife, Beyonce' has picked the wasted Flawless as her latest single from the lackluster self-titled record.

{"text":"I never would have thought Id buy a Courtney Love song, I didn't even know she was a singer.  This goes to show just how awesome the Empire series is. She does two songs for the show and both are nice. I bought Walk out on me because of its gritty Blues style. The song reminds me of Billie Holiday and so does the Elle Dallas character she plays on the show (Ive read that the Elle role was modeled after Whitney Houston, whose life was similar to Billies). The Elle character, Whitney and Billie typifies two of the many themes you see throughout the Empire series, the dual nature of dysfunction and collapse. Billie Holidays greatness came from the dysfunction of her experience just as Empire records and Elle Dallass greatness came from the dysfunction of their experience. This same dysfunction led to the collapse of Elle and Billies career and could lead to the collapse of Empire records. With Billies collapse there was death and with Elles there is rebirth.  The dual nature of dysfunction is becoming more evident in our everyday world now days. We have an intricate and interconnected world village that has achieved greatness that has never been seen before. Weve created synthetic foods and life, weve gone to the Moon, and created widgets for just about anything we desire. Whats becoming more evident though is there seems to be a collapse underway, whether its the terrorist threat (real or manufactured), the extreme and erratic weather patterns, the health epidemic of diseases that never existed a hundred years ago, countries teetering on default or the cons and shams thats trying to take what little money we have to finance a system that is bankrupt, there is an elephant in the room thats becoming ever harder to ignore.

It has the kinda chorus that'll get you singing along once you learn the words too, which is always a plus 8\/10)\n\nBecause of you...(The chorus on this one seems almost perfect, right up until the end. The thing is, they try to jam too many words into too little time, and the result is an almost ugly sound. Minus that little detail, its a great song 8\/10)\n\nFigured You Out...(The second single, and totally stupid lyrically. Still, it's pretty catchy 7\/10)\n\nShould've listened...(The fact that I can't remember how it goes tells me right away that it's forgetable. Too be fair, I won't grade it n\/a)\n\nThrow Yourself Away...(Its got a very \"Nickelback\" sound, which is a good thing. The lyrics are pretty heavy too, kinda like \"Never Again\" from silver side up 9\/10)\n\nAnother Hole In The Head...(For some reason, the chorus really stands out for me on this one. That alone makes it worth listening to 8\/10)\n\nSee you at the show...(Great (offical) closer. The chorus is great, the verses are great, and the song is very catchy. The lyrics are kinda dumb tho 8.5\/10)\n\nThe Other 3 Songs...I don't really listen to these, at all.

This is what I do (89.0 dB) immediately upon downloading my new albums, however for those who choose to stream from Amazon you have to deal with the constant volume changes until Amazon adds volume normalization.

{"text":"Spark Seeker's slick computer driven pop production loses the earthy realism of Matisyahu's earlier and much better albums. Just like his look which went from warm, holy Jew to cold, sunglasses over sad eyes, bleach blond corporate \"pop star\", his music has sadly followed in the same artificial flavor path. Spark Seeker is over-produced laptop created techno pop for people with short attention spans and hands on their cellphones 24 hrs a day. The music has about as much spark and depth as a Michael Jackson album. If you have nothing better to do you might dance a little to it but then you realize that your really not being moved and you flip channels. For some strange reason that seems like either a bad acid trip or some kind of serious case of bi polar disorder, Matis seems to be riding the plastic train of superficiality full speed ahead.\n\nTo go from a cool sincere Jew, proudly committed to the Jewish faith to a Hollywood type prancing around like a stoned effeminate factory made pop star wearing more scarves than Elton John is about as spiritual as a good Saturday Night Live skit. Its good comedy but certainly not real art or real life(living). There is nothing spiritual going on here except worship of the EGO-that false god that claims the lives and vitality of many good people. The whole \"spiritual journey\" thing is a total scam as the journey here is all about ME--not Him.\n\nJews don't have spiritual journey's on facebook and twitter and with constant photo shoots celebrating new haircuts. After 3500 years their path to the One above is much, much deeper. They have spiritual journeys when they are true to their Torah and their identity. Everything else is just Hollywood. Matis himself sang this in the song \"Jerusalem\" --\"Change your name and your identity, don't you know that's not the way to be\". His fans need to be given a little more credit. Does he really think that they would fall for this sad display of holy Jewish soul that lost its way? No one wants to see the Jews act like everyone else. The world wants the Jews to be role models to teach the great wisdom about life that they have. Those who understand will understand and pray for all the impressionable children soiled by this irresponsible use of popularity and influence. Let's hope and pray that Matisyahu finds his way back to his soul and this is just a short detour in his life's journey.","classification":1,"fold":1}

I was actually trying to watch an Austin Malone video when I saw the audio version of Sing advertised as a recommendation for me to listen to.  Needless to say, Sing by Ed Sheeran meshes guitar sounds and upbeat pop melodies together in a complementary way while appearing to send the message of a man trying to tell someone that they must let him know if they have feelings for them. Sing by Ed Sheeran is a fun song to hear if you enjoy pop beats with a hint of a guitar.","classification":5,"fold":1}

I was working as a cashier at the now closed-down grocery store and every weekend I'd go to one of the local bars to just converse and people watch with my aunt and a friend just so we could get out the house. Also, before that, I had moved out of the house temporarily (for like a week or two) because me and my mom were at each other's necks and this CD among many accompanied me.\n\nThe album version is not butchered for I have the CD so I expect this version to be the same as on the CD. Lil' Kim's verse is in full effect. But anyway.\n\nThe beat is fun, in a few ways sounds dated, but still good. The little twinkle effect to it is pretty tight even 2 years later. I can't believe it's been that long!\n\nIn the song, Keyshia is talking about how if a man is no longer acting right, and making you cry, let him go, set him free and be a better person for it.\n\nThis song features Missy Elliot and Lil' Kim on the guest spots with Missy's occasional take over of the song with her \"shout out's\".\n\nBut if you haven't heard it or even seen the video, I strongly, strongly suggest you do. It's a song to add to the party playlist if you don't mind going back 2 years.\n\n4.25 stars.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"For those of us who were teenagers in the 1960's the news of the sudden passing of Davy Jones a few years back came as quite a shock. For a couple of years in the mid 1960's the group known as The Monkees was nothing short of a national phenomenon. Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolenz and Michael Nesmith became household names virtually overnight. Their debut single \"Last Train To Clarksville\" was released in September of 1966 and would go all the way to #1 on the Billboard charts. That very same month \"The Monkees\" TV show debuted on NBC and just a few weeks later \"The Monkees\" LP was released and would go on to top the national charts for 13 weeks! Producer Don Kirshner would spare no expense in providing quality material for his sensational new group. The Monkees would record tunes by such notable writers as Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann, Neil Diamond and Carole King and Gerry Coffin to name but a few. Meanwhile, Kirshner also employed a number of the top studio musicians of the day to help to make these records. Over the next couple of years The Monkees and Co. would boast a total of a half dozen Top Ten singles and four #1 albums.\n\nBy March 1968 The Monkees had already amassed an impressive total of 7 Top 20 hits including three #1 songs.  It was at this time that Colgems released their next single \"Valleri\".  In my opinion this was the most rockin' tune that The Monkees ever recorded.  Featuring the aforementioned Davy Jones on lead the song rocketed to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart.  But winds of change were in the air and the phenomenon that was The Monkees was coming to an end.  \"Valleri\" would be their final Top Ten record.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"In late 2001, Cher had released, yet, another album. No, this one is not a compilation; it is a studio recorded album. No, you did not read this statement wrong. This album is, indeed, another studio recorded album for Cher. The album is entitled, LIVING PROOF, and is her best album since that of  1998's BELIEVE. The album is jam packed with great songs, including four hit singles that were released. Read on to find out more.\n\nSONG FOR THE LONELY\n\n  The first single from the album. When I first heard this song, I was really amazed. I could not believe how incredible this song was. The lyrics are so strong and motivating, as Cher's voice is strong and powerful. I strongly recommend that you all listen to this song first because 1) It is the first song on the album, and 2) Cher has dedicated this song to, and I quote from her album thanks, \"...The courageous people of New York, Mayor Gulianni, Governor Pataki, and my friend Liz...\"\n\nA DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE SONG\n\n  The third single from the album. This is a song that would be most popular on the dance floors at clubs and other get-together parties. This is definitely a kick-a** tune.\n\nALIVE AGAIN\n\n  The fourth & final single from the album. Awesome tune.\n\nTHE MUSIC'S NO GOOD WITHOUT YOU\n\n  The second single from the album. \"A Different Kind Of Love Song\" is not the only song that should be played in clubs; this song would also fit into that of clubs, where people can immediately get their groove on. This song has an edgier groove for anyone who wants to shake their a** on the dance floor.\n\nRAIN, RAIN\n\n  Not bad.\n\nREAL LOVE\n\n  Not bad.\n\nLOVE SO HIGH\n\n  Incredible\n\nBODY TO BODY, HEART TO HEART\n\n  Diane Warren has written so many songs for so many solo artists since I can remember. She has written such songs as, \"Who Will You Run To\" for Heart, \"Love Can Move Mountains\" for Celine Dion, & \"If I Could Turn Back Time\" for Cher. This was another one of Diane Warren's songs and Cher was happy enough to grace Diane's lyrics with her music and voice.\n\nLOVE IS A LONELY PLACE WITHOUT YOU\n\n  Great.\n\nLOVE ONE ANOTHER\n\n  Back in 2000, when Amber released her self-titled album, she had originally recorded this song. Cher took the courage to cover the song. The song is amazing in every way and I think Amber would be most proud of this version, even though her version kicked a** as well. If you listen to both versions, you'll notice that Cher had re-written the second verse for her version, as well as re-writing the last two lines of the song's bridge.\n\nWHEN YOU WALK AWAY\n\n  Not bad.\n\nWHEN THE MONEY'S GONE\n\n  Not bad.\n\n  This is an album that I have enjoyed from start to finish and I do encourage each and everyone of you, who have not yet heard this album, to buy it and listen to it. I guarantee you all that you will enjoy every song on this album from start to finish. If you do not like it, than I've done my part, while receiving the wrong response.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Album: 4 stars; Live show: 5 stars\n\nIt seems just like yesterday that Radiohead released its latest (9th overall) album, but in fact it's been already over two years ago since the band unleashed \"A Moon Shaped Pool\"onto the world. I have to admit, at first I wasn't really \"getting it\", but over time, this album has in turn released its inner beauty and I have been playing this album a LOT in the last couple of months, ahead of the band's return to Cincinnati (more on that later).\n\n\"A Moon Shaped Pool\" (11 tracks; 53 min.) opens with the urgent \"Burn The Witch\", which reminds me of the \"Hail to the Thief\" songs. It is followed by \"Daydreaming\", an introspective tune (and traditional concert opener on the current tour). We then get to \"Decks Dark\", which is my favorite track: I love the gradual build-up, and then the extra kick in the last 90 sec., just perfect, The album is now revved up and in full gear. Not that it means the songs are all loud or hard, far from it, but there is a cohesion to the soundscape as we go from track to track that just feels right. Among other highlights: \"Ful stop\" is mesmerizing, and \"The Numbers\" feels wistful. The album's closer is \"True Love Waits\", the song that has been around for 2 decades in one form or another. The live acoustic guitar version on 2001's \"I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings\" is a thing of beauty, but now comes this definitive version, featuring piano and keyboards, rather than acoustic guitar. What a great song.\n\nI've seen Radiohead live a number of times over the years, and had the good fortune of seeing them in concert again this week here in Cincinnati. They played a 2 hr. 20 min. show that can only be described as magical. Playing from pretty much their entire catalog, the sold-out crowd ate it up from start to finish. The 4 songs from \"A Moon Shaped Pool\" blended in nicely. Check this out: Set List Cincinnati 7\/25\/18: 1. Daydreaming 2. Desert Island Disk 3. Ful Stop 4.2 + 2 = 5 5. Myxomatosis 6. Kid A 7.

{"text":"When it has came considered down to Michael buble, he has actually been one of the few singers that actually has made standards his own, without the feeling that they are either corny or watered down like Rod Stewart and Barry Manilow have shown for the past several years. For his latest single, the holiday staple It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas is absolutely elequent and simple, and doesn't feel like it is wasted away. Something Michael has done very, very well upon for the holiday standards that just feels classic with Michael's voice. I don't know why many several artists haven't delivered in those classic they way Michael Buble has showed, but this is a great download for anyone whom looks like he does in a beginning to look a lot like Christmas.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":1}
{"text":"Weezer are the sort of band that are seemingly cursed by their legacy. On one end of the spectrum, a good chunk of their fanbase hold them up to the impossible standards of their first two albums -- the rightfully revered \"The Blue Album\" and \"Pinkerton.\" On the other end, there's a swarm of critics (rightfully) ready to pounce on them every time they drop a \"Raditude.\" Keeping with the theme of 2014's surprising return to form (an overused phrase if ever there was one, but certainly applicable in this scenario) with \"Everything Will Be Alright In The End,\" the band's tenth album, finds Weezer just being Weezer. No silly guest spots, no goofy cover songs and no misguided tip-toeing into uncharted musical waters. Without borrowing too much from their past, this self-titled \"White\" album sounds as if the Weezer of the '90s never left us.\n\nA mere 10 songs deep and clocking in at just over a half-hour, \"The White Album\" brings to mind memories of the band's 2001 comeback effort, \"The Green Album.\" The two albums share similar DNA in their (seemingly) sunny disposition and straight-forwardness, though where \"Green\" failed to capture the \"true\" Weezer spirit, \"White,\" more often than not, succeeds. There's a few stumbling blocks to get past, however; be advised that \"Thank God For Girls\" is a red-herring not unlike the previous album's \"Back To The Shack\" and in no way represents the other 9 tracks. And while some of the song titles may lead you to believe the band is receding back into the abyss of the late 2000s, you can be rest assured that this is simply not the case. \"L.A. Girlz\" has probably the stupidest title of the entire record, and yet it's the best song, hands down. Hitting a melodic sweet spot somewhere between \"Blue\" and \"Pinkerton,\" \"L.A. Girlz\" just gets better with each and every listen and carries with it just as much charm as its quirky music video. Similarly, \"Do You Wanna Get High?\" taps into a dark period in frontman Rivers Cuomo's past and appropriately so, injects the sort of angst back into Weezer's music that has been all but absent for over a decade.\n\n\"The White Album\" isn't quite pure, uncut Weezer, but you can hear the band really gelling and stretching their legs now that they are 20+ years into their career. With as spotty a career as they've had, no one would've expected them to come back from the brink as strongly as they did two years ago, let alone keeping that streak going. But \"The White Album\" accomplishes just that, proving that \"Everything Will Be Alright In The End\" wasn't a fluke and going a long way to win back the hearts of those who fell in love with the band long ago, in a pop-culture bubble far, far away.","classification":4,"fold":1}

The performances and recording quality are quite good.  I own the Bach Cantata complete sets recorded by Rilling, Suzuki, Gardiner and the Netherlands Bach Collegium, and have now made good progress on accumulating a complete set of Bach Guild interpretations.  In addition, I have a few recordings each of cantatas by several other conductors.  Each conductor brings their own perspective and talents to Bach, and helps prove that they comprise the greatest achievement in musical history, towering over even the symphonies of Beethoven, the quartets of Hayden, the oratorios of Handel.  My advice is to pony up your 99 cents as fast as you can, and dig into the delicious harmony, counterpoint and musical inventiveness of Johann Sebastian Bach.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Jazmine Sullivan returns with her sophomore album Love Me Back and it is an outstanding effort.  With a voice reminiscent of Mary J. Blige in terms of pure passion and emotion, she makes you feel every word she's singing.  She reemerged on the scene earlier this year with her single Going In Circles which was a throwback to 90's R&B but updated for 2010.  It's arguably her greatest song to date.  When she is singing about pain such as the second single 10 Seconds, she has that rare quality in her voice that is distinguishable and unique.  She's easily one of the most soulful artists to emerge in the past 5 years.  True soul music.\n\nThe album delivers on that premise with song after song of great arrangements, soulful singing, and great lyrics.  She brings out her inner 80's on Don't Make Me Wait and Ne-Yo serves as the only guest on the duet U Get On My Nerves.  The only songs I'm not really feeling are Love You Long Time & Redemption, not because they are horrible songs it's just that I'm not really feeling their vibe.\n\nJazmine Sullivan comes through with another solid effort that showcases her talents and is thoroughly enjoyable.  She is a true talent in music and this album is worth a purchase as it has powerful songs with plenty of replay value.  She has that voice that makes your hair stand up in the back of your neck. You definitely won't be disappointed with this album if you are a fan of Jazmine or quality R&B\/Soul music.  4.4 Stars.","classification":4,"fold":1}

Things added to his orange juice...\n\nJoao Gilberto also has a good reason to have a grudge against Getz but it doesn't show here, he is as mellow as usual. A trooper. His singing and guitar & Heloise hold the day, while Getz pretty much phones it in. What's good on this album comes from him.\n\nFor better Getz, pick any other decade or his life.

This was a damn good country record. And by now you probably know all the other guests who harmonize with Henley on the 16 tracks here. MOST  not all  of the songs are newly penned by Henley and his writing partner Stan Lynch. For a cover Henley chose the classic Jesse Winchester song Brand New Tennessee Waltz and it works great.\nI already see trhere are 117 reviews posted here before me (I just got the CD) so I won't rehash what others said.\n\nThe CD itself comes in a tri-fold digipak and contains a 16-page booklet with all the lyrics.

But this music was better than that. I never knew anyone who disliked The Grass Roots. Lead singer Rob Grilli and the gang simply made outstanding pop singles.  In August of 1968 Dunhill\/ABC released \"Midnight Confessions\".  Peaking at #5 it would prove to be the group's biggest hit and best selling single.  Since there are a number of re-recordings out there you should know that this is the original hit single version you would remember from the radio.","classification":5,"fold":1}

No one has a perfect life or relationship, but K. Michelle says instead of calling it quits lets come together and work this thing out.\n\nYou got to love a message that says it all in the lyrics, words that men and women can relate to. V.S.O.P is a classic single and easily one of the best singles of the year in my opinion. Say what you want about K.

But if you want to hear a truly electric performance, go with this live album.\nFrom the first cut, \"Sweet Baby James\", you can sense the perfect rapport with the audience.  The live version of \"Mexico\" is quite enhanced by the life atmosphere, and by the time you get to \"Fire and Rain\", you can sense a flow between the singer and his audience.  The energy reaches its zenith on \"Shower The People\" and \"How Sweet It Is\".\nCut after cut is notable here.  The pure country sound of \"She Thinks I Still Care\" is a highlight.  \"You've Got A Friend\" and \"That Lonesome Road\" close a truly exciting experience.

He was only working as a Level 0. Besides it being a top secret lab, he was still just a janitor.\n\nOften, he saw a monkey in a lab coat running through the halls (Dad said to stay the Hell away from it; one of the few times he ever looked scared). Once, he saw one of the scientists holding a camcorder and following a six-foot-tall thing with eight legs and four arms; he hoped it was some kind of robot even though it didn't move like one. And he really wondered why they let that one man walk around in nothing but a bathrobe even though everyone looked like they hated him.\n\nAll of this, Randy saw while cleaning the floors or emptying the garbage cans. And then there was that tree. Though it creeped him out, he liked being in its courtyard because he could at least see the sky there. He had the job of cleaning up what came out of one side of the tree. He especially didn't like doing that. The smell alone was terrible, and it steamed up his glasses so that he had to keep cleaning them, leaving him almost completely blind.\n\nRandy really really wanted to know what Dad was thinking, putting him through this. Even though he got to see a lot of weird stuff, it was a totally crap job.\n\nMeanwhile, in another part of the same site, a member of the administrative staff was speaking to an Agent.\n\n\"Agent Foxtrot, I'm glad that I managed to speak to you at last.\"\n\n\"I'm always available to speak to a superior, Sir.\"\n\n\"I was looking through the site's personnel roster and I noticed a strange discrepancy. For some reason, I saw your name listed twice. One as an Agent, and one as a Level 0 worker.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir. This is correct.\"\n\n\"I also noticed that the lower ranked Randy Foxtrot is somehow assigned to aid in maintaining an anomalous object, despite being Level 0. And I assume that you had something to do with this. Is that also correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir. Is there anything else?\"\n\n\"Damn right, there's something else! I demand an explanation!\"\n\n\"May I speak candidly, Sir?\"\n\n\"If that gives me an explanation, then yes.\"\n\n\"Well, Sir, I'm sure you know that I'm going to retire in about a year. After that, the Foundation becomes nothing more than a memory. I wanted to leave this place with one less regret. That's all. I had to pull in a lot of favours for this to happen. The boy is still going to be given amnesics after this is all over. And I bet that my last year with the Foundation is going to be pure Hell. But I had to do it.\"\n\n\"All this. Sacrificing the rest of your career and risking your pension. Just for him. Why?\"\n\n\"I raised Junior from when he was an infant. I love him like a son. I feel proud every time he calls me Dad, even though I know it's not the truth. I wanted to do this last thing for him while I still could. I wanted, just once, for him to meet his real father.\"\n\nAs Randy began to leave the courtyard, one of the tree's branches bent down in front of his face. The eyeballs at each tip hovered mere inches away from him, seeming to take in every feature. The branch, looking so much like an arm, then reached for his head and tousled his hair? After that, the branch once again pointed back up to the sky. This place is weird.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Silver-toned Ed Brown's 50 year news reporting career included stints at WMCA-570 AM and WNEW-1130 AM in NYC and for the RKO and NBC radio networks. He retired in 1997 after some years at WCHL-1360, in Chapel Hill, NC.\n\nFounded in 1925 as a 5,000 watt station at the top of the AM dial, by 1960 WMCA adopted their successful \"Good Guys\" Top 40 format. Despite competition from 50,000 watt clear channel WABC-770, 'MCA was NYC's ratings champ from 1963 through '66. By 1970, they transitioned to an all talk format called \"Dial-Log Radio.\"\n\nNYC's PREMIER ALBUMS was founded in 1959 as a budget operation with such labels as CORONET and SPIN-O-RAMA. In 1965, Premier bought out Philly-based CAMEO\/PARKWAY. Their JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY - A MEMORIAL ALBUM (#2099) is fine-quality: a substantial disc with good audio. The record reproduces in full a one-hour show narrated by Brown and broadcast over WMCA on the day of JFK's murder, 11\/22\/63. All but two speeches selected are excerpts.\n\nThe LP's back cover has the memorial service eulogy given by Cardinal Richard Cushing of Massachusetts, and the lying in state remarks of House Speaker John McCormack (of Boston), Chief Justice Earl Warren (former Gov. of CA.) and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (of MT.). Mansfield's comments were briefest, but also the most moving:\n\n\"There was a sound of laughter; in a moment, it\nwas no more. And so she took a ring from her finger\nand placed it in his hands.\nThere was a husband who asked much and gave much,\nand out of the giving and the asking wove with a\nwoman what could not be broken in life, and in a\nmoment it was no more. And so she took a ring from\nher finger and placed it in his hands, and kissed him\nand closed the lid of a coffin.\nA piece of each of us died at that moment. Yet, in\ndeath he gave of himself to us. He gave us of a good\nheart from which the laughter came. He gave us of a\nprofound wit, from which a great leadership emerged.\"\n\nSIDE ONE\n[21:20] Oath of Office (1\/20\/61); Campaign speech on being Catholic; \"New Frontier\" acceptance speech, 1960 Democratic Convention, L.A.; First Nixon-Kennedy Debate; Inaugural Address, unedited (1\/20\/61)\n\nSIDE TWO\n[27:10] West Berlin and the dangers of Communism's expansion (Alliance For Progress); U.S. Steel price increases (spring '62); Cuban Missile Crisis TV speech, conclusion (Oct.

{"text":"For such a \"much anticipated\" return to the recording studio by this legendary superband which dominated the radio in the 70's and 80's, this effort falls short of expectations.  While there are a number of highlight moments on this CD, including an energetic \"90 Degrees and Freezing\", a Motown-inspired, horn driven \"Come to Me Do\" and a catchy and powerful pop gem \"Feel\" (all penned by all-time great songwriter Robert Lamm), the record suffers from an over-abundance of ballads and sorry, over-blown production. I'm not a producer, but I know what sounds good to my ears.\nI have nothing against some ballads on a Chicago album, but the ones on this Chicago album, the first recording of all-original material in 15 years, are simply not good, whether from a songwriting or performance standpoint. I won't go down the list, but will cite \"King of Might Have Been\" as an example of bassist Jason Scheff's mostly able tenor painfully straining to hit notes out of his range.\nI don't know what producer Jay DeMarcus was thinking in putting this together as a Chicago CD, but the end result is a lot of tracks sounding like his own band, Rascal Flatts. No more to say as this speaks for itself.  As confirmed by the band, DeMarcus was also responsible for choosing the material for the recording, and pushed aside many songs written by the band members in favor of the mostly trite fare that shows up on \"XXX\". Considering that Robert Lamm and Bill Champlin have proven they can still pen solid pop\/rock\/R&B songs as found on their string of solo recordings, a CD of Chicago-only songs would, undoubtably been more listenable and a more worthy end product than what we hear on \"XXX\".\nFinally, DeMarcus uses an army of studio musicians in place of the actual band members, thereby destroying any integrity this album would have had at least as a document of a Chicago band performance.\n\"Chicago XXX\" \"could have been a contender\" with a different approach to the CD's production.  We'll just have to wait for \"Chicago XXXI\".","classification":2,"fold":1}

PLEASE all you newcomer jewel fans, pick up one of her EARLIER albums and you will see why us REAL jewel fans hate this cd so much.  she's throwing away good talent, and good looks.  i liked her look before, now she just looks like a hooker.\nbut all in all let's pray that jewel went through a phase, and will go back to her original stuff on her next album.

When I had heard that he was coming back with a new album, Return Of The Tender Lover, I was honestly very skeptical to hear whether or not he still had a unique gift in songwriting. I heard We've Got Love, and it was alright, but not anything to rave about in regards to what I have loved about his brilliance and beauty in songwriting for himself, and for others like Whitney Houston and Madonna. Exceptional, the second single from Return Of The Tender Lover is a better song that is simply of his class in songwriting. I found the song to be better at the soul of what he had recorded from his entire legacy of song. I found the song to be one of his best from the album, but not his greatest at song. If you really haven't heard a Babyface song before, than this is one I absolutely recommend you check out.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":1}

It seems to be a more aggressive and deliberate album than their previous and each song sounds pretty unique.

Ever since I saw him open for Randy Travis back in 1990 when \"Here In The Real World\" (Alan's first #1) came out I knew Alan was destined to be not only a country music singer, but a country music superstar with staying power. He has always been a man who has never disappointed his audience with his pure country music songs, most of which he has written himself. He is widely regarded, along with Garth Brooks, for changing the face of country music in the early '90's, by giving country its roots back after the industry in Nashville became too pop-sounding.\n\n In this excellent two-disc CD set fans get a complete overview of Alan's remarkable twenty year career with every single of his remarkable 34 #1 songs along with three new singles. Highlights include \"Don't Rock The Jukebox\", \"Dallas\", \"Wanted\", \"Chatahoochee\", \"Summertime Blues\", and my favorite of all his compositions \"Remember When\", a song he wrote for his wife Denise. The package also contains the healing 9 11 song \"Where Were You When The World Stopped Turning?\", Alan's masterpiece in his response to the terrorist attacks in 2001. The three new songs in the set include a remake of Johnny Cash's \"Ring of Fire\" with Lee Ann Womack and \"As She's Walking Away\" with the Zac Brown Band.\n\n An amazing career set, Alan's \"34 #1's\" is not only for the ardent Alan Jackson fan, but for lovers of music who would like to own material from one of the most honored male singers in the last twenty years.\n\n A+!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Lady Antebellum `blew up' in 2010 by all means.  The country trio with enough chops to crossover to an inviting pop audience had one of the biggest albums of 2010 in regards to sales, critical response, and the music industry itself.  Unfortunately, many times, acts like Lady Antebellum get overhyped too much as does their respective release.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Need-You-Now\/dp\/B002WIDRM6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Need You Now<\/a>&nbsp;proves to be a solid album by all means - and one of the year's better efforts - though the hype by fans and some outlets may be a bit overwrought.  That is nothing against the group who is a solid and polished collective by all means, but in reality, Lady Antebellum are nothing incredibly `new' to the industry - they are a solid act with a nice, restrained (sometimes too much so) sound that has incredible commercial appeal.  They are an alternative to groups such as Rascal Flatts and The Dixie Chicks (who are starting to show age by music industry standards).  None have to look any farther than first single and opening cut \"Need You Now\" to see why this once small group has grown into the ultimate commercial group to beat.\n\n\"Need You Now\" is the valedictory cut from Need You Now, though it is accompanied by some exceptional competition, surprisingly.  The production work here is brilliant, straddling country and pop worlds making this cut the #2 pop hit it was.  There is superb chemistry between vocalist Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott, who trade off between verses.  The pre-chorus (bridge before the chorus) is well penned (\"and I wonder if I ever cross your mind, for me it happens all the time\"), not to mention the classic chorus: \"It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now, said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control, and I need you now, and I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now\" Any doubters should be silenced by this exceptional cut that makes the non-country fan want to beg for more.\n\n\"Our Kind of Love\" is none too shabby itself, changing the pace after the moodier \"Need You Now.\"  Here the band adheres to a `country' sound which lessens the appeal to the crossover audience built by \"Need You Now.\"  The biggest quibble, however is the length of this cut as opposed to whether it is `country-sounding' or `pop-sounding.'  \"American Honey\" silences pundits quickly with beautiful production work through lush strings and superb songwriting once more.  Here, Hillary Scott is the featured vocalist, with Kelley's vocal turns mixed behind her (this happens throughout the album depending on who is truly `featured' between the two).  \"American Honey\" is one of many examples of the exceptional engineering of this album if nothing else.\n\n\"Hello World\" is a bit of a downgrade compared to the first three cuts, finding Charles Kelley's vocals lovely, yet too `sleepy' here at times.  The cut is pretty - don't get me wrong - but it just does not feel as inspired as pre-eminent cut \"Need You Now.\"  Hillary Scot does not enter until nearly the 2:00 mark (mixed in the background for the most part). Only the dynamic ending truly atones for the lack of \"oomph\" with this cut.  \"Perfect Day\" atones for the missteps of \"Hello Word\" with a more driving groove and up-tempo feel here.  Also bowing in \"Perfect Day's\" favor is the brief duration at 3:20 and the production work.\n\n\"Love This Pain\" is solid, though a shade less enjoyable than the very best cuts.  Here, the highlights are the refrain and the superb bridge.  \"When You Got A Good Thing\" is the next noteworthy cut, however, giving \"Need You Now\" its first true taste of competition as the best cut.  This cut is a nice stripped-down ballad that features superb country instrumental ideas and straddles the line of soft-rock.  Again, songwriting makes a cut like this effective - not to mention some superb guitar playing by Dave Haywood, whose role can not be underwritten in the instrumental aspects of this album.\n\n\"Stars Tonight\" is a mid-tempo cut, that like the general pattern of this album does not stand out as the best, but is solid for the most part.  The vocal mix between Hillary Scott and Charles Kelley is spot-on as always. The track itself is enjoyable, but not revolutionary and is saved by the addition of a chorus backing Scott and Kelley's vocals near the end.  \"If I Knew Then\" again saves the day for a track less satisfying preceding it.  The six-feel is wonderful and a nice change of pace for the trio.  The songwriting is among the best of the album, yielding some wonderful lyrically driven moments: \"Cause love only comes, once in a while, knocks on your door, and throws you a smile, and takes every breath and leaves every scar\/speaks to your soul, and sings to your heart...\" Like \"When You Got a Good Thing,\" it is one of few tracks to truly rival centerpiece cut \"Need You Now.\" \"Something `Bout A Woman\" and \"Ready to Love Again\" are solid, but don't feel as relevant or solid as the best cuts from Need You Now.\n\nAll said, Need You Now is a good album that for the most part lives up to the hype that currently surrounds Lady Antebellum.  As stated prior, the hype is a bit much and this album is NOT without its flaws.  At times, the album sags and relies too much on restrained productions and songwriting conceptions that make the songs somewhat `same-y.'  Luckily,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Need-You-Now\/dp\/B002WIDRM6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Need You Now<\/a>&nbsp;is packed with enough memorable moments and well crafted songs to atone and counteract the less remarkable moments and that is the mark of a group with considerable musicianship and a knack for marketing.  Solid and enjoyable effort that should the group several Grammy nods.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"The last few years haven't always been kind to Scott Weiland. First he was booted from Velvet Revolver, then he was fired from Stone Temple Pilots, and then came a poorly received tour in which Scott wasn't always sober (I can attest to that, having been to the Boston Wilbur show). And then on the eve of Blaster (2015), Scotts new album with his band the Wildabouts, tragedy struck as lead guitarist Jeremy Brown died unexpectedly. But even if Scott hasn't always been a consistent live performer, made the best decisions or gotten along with fellow band mates, he has at least consistently released good albums. His six albums with Stone Temple Pilots and two with Velvet Revolver are all pretty great, his Bowie-esque solo debut 12 Bar Blues, (1998) was excellent, as was his follow-up a decade later with Happy in Galoshes (2008). Even his kitschy, bizarre Christmas album The Most Wonderful Time of the Year (2011) was fun. Now, after a half decade (excluding the holiday album and a track from the Avengers soundtrack), Scott is back with a new album, and overall, its pretty good.\n\nWhile Scotts first two albums were electronic, arty and Bowie-like, Blaster goes for a different sound. Blaster has a lo-fi, garage rock aesthetic thats been popular for the last few years, blended with retro 1970s glam. Think White Stripes\/Black Keys meets T-Rex. The Wildabouts (Jeremy Brown-guitar, Tommy Black-bass, Danny Thompson-drums) aren't anywhere near the same caliber as the DeLeo brothers and Eric Ktetz, but they're good and help Scott reach his vision of making indie, retro, garage rock.\n\nThe opening track, Modzilla, sounds an awful lot like the White Stripes Icky Thump. Still, this mid-tempo rocker has a good groove. One can see why the T-Rex sounding Way She Moves would be used as one of the first singles, as it has a good hook and might actually get some radio play. Hotel Rio kind of reminded me of the Eagles, and sounds like a middle-of-the-road but good 70s rocker. The psychedelic Amethyst\" sounds like it could have been a Tiny Music (1996) left-over or b-side. When I first heard White Lightening I immediately thought of the Doors Roadhouse Blues, a song that Scott has played live before. Blue Eyes goes for the same kind of power-pop of later-day Stone Temple Pilots, but falls a little short. One cant help comparing the song, unfavorably, with the superior Cinnamon from STPs (underrated) 2010 self-titled album. Bleed Out, is pretty much a rip-off of Nirvanas Stay Away, but it still works. Youth Quake has a punk feeland it wouldnt have sounded out-of-place on a Generation X album (Billy Idols old band). Beach Pop is pure power-pop, and it does in fact sound like it was made for some 1960s Frankie and Annette cheeseball film. Parachute is an okay-but-not-great rockernot bad, not particularly memorable either. Things wind down with a respectable cover of T-Rexs 20th Century Boy and end on a very good note with the excellent, Country-esque, melancholy, acoustic Circles.\n\nBlaster has its weak pointstheres a little filler and some tracks miss-the-mark, but overall, I really enjoyed the album. Some people will undoubtedly point out that this isn't the most original sounding album, and it isnt, but I won't hold that against Scott or Blaster, because its still well written and very enjoyable.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"What a wonderful Prince album for lovers of the funk! And on a strictly personal note, a vast improvement on it's predecessor. As good a move it was for Prince to have hired young producer Joshua Welton for&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/HITNRUN-Phase-One\/dp\/B014RPCV82\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">HITNRUN Phase One<\/a>,I had the concern that album would stand alongside many of the artists mid\/late 90's releases in terms of not aging well. Attempts made by Prince to incorporate current production trends  generally resulted in showcasing what an unhealthy state soul\/R&B music was at these given times. He and the NPG were (and in the case of the band still are) hardcore funk musicians. So on Prince's swansong,he and the band basically worked it back to the rhythm of the one.\n\n\"Baltimore\" is beautifully melodic soul rocker paying tribute to young Freddie Gray due to police brutality,as well as offering some some sage advice for modern civil rights activism. \"Rocknroll Loveaffair\" is a bass pumping,danceable country rocker with a sleek bluesy attitude while \"2 Y.3. D\" a James Brown style horn heavy pop funk jam. \"Look At Me,Look At U\" is a rolling,mid tempo jazz\/funk groove full of slap bass,Fender Rhodes and flute while \"Stare\" takes that bass,drums,guitar,horns and turns up the funk heavy. \"Xtraloveable\" turns up the bass synth and the strong pop melody for a thick boogie funk stomp where \"Groovy Potential\" is another slinky mid tempo jazz\/funk ballad with some sexy guitar.\n\n\"When She Comes\" brings out that classic 60's southern soul ballad with that slow scaling guitar while \"Screwdriver\" brings in a rhythmic riffing of a driving pop\/rocker. \"Black Muse\" is a nice,chunky down home funky soul tune-one full of hit horns and chugging rhythm that deals with how important black American music is to the history of the artistic medium itself. \"Revelation\" is a gentle,spare ballad that again features a strong electric piano presence along with Prince's ethereal falsetto vocal mix.  The album concludes with \"Big City\". It begins with that P-funk style chromatic walk-down before getting into some wah wah heavy melodic funk.\n\nMore than anything,what this album does is showcase just how much Prince's musical evolution came out of funk-despite the modern perception that his rockier hits represented the baseline of his entire creative ethic. On that note,even the guitar rockers here return to the happily melodic,hook filled nature of his 80's era music of this genre-as opposed to the aloof weariness of some of Prince's recent rock oriented music Primarily though,this album emphasis Prince as a straight up band leader-getting funkiest drums,horns and jazzy keyboards out of the NPG. Prince's sudden and young death is still a tragedy. But especially for the funk lover,this album is one bang of a way to go out!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"\"The Middle\" by Jimmy Eat World is a positive song about having the self-confidence to see your own beauty and great qualities in yourself regardless of what others may think. This musical gem also serves as a reminder to do the best you can, and to be patient when allowing in all of the good in your life. I also appreciate that the message of the song is to also know that it is important to avoid giving power to what others may say or think (also the added insight to be and see your own brilliance regardless of if others would). Last, but not least, this energetic and fun musical track sends a great message about being emotionally strong (thick-skinned), and to project your personal power with your best effort while simultaneously being aware that everything in your life is going to be just fine. My favorite part of the song with the following lyrics communicates this meaning in a strong manner:\n\nIt just takes some time\nLittle Girl You're in the middle of the ride\nEverything, everything will be just fine\nEverything, everything will be alright, alright\n\n  \"The Middle\" is a brilliant track that applies to both men and women from all walks of life even with taking the \"little girl\" metaphor into account. I suggest this song (with absolute self-confidence) if you know that events in your life are going to unfold perfectly and in a joyful manner, but you also crave listening to a song that powerfully gives this reminder (in addition to sending the message to always see your personal beauty and unlimited power regardless of how others may treat you)","classification":5,"fold":1}

Here you will find her second and third Warner albums (Cage the songbird, from 1983, and Nobody wants to be alone, from 1984). I do not play these albums as often as most of Crystal's other music but I always enjoy hearing them. They are high quality albums featuring the type of pop-country music that was popular on American country radio at the time, helping to maintain Crystal's position as one of the most important female singers in country music at the time, though she did not maintain that position for much longer.\nThe title track of Cage the Songbird is a cover of a relatively obscure but wonderful Elton John song. Other great songs include The sound of goodbye, I don't wanna lose your love and Turning away as well as fine covers of Victim or a fool (Rodney Crowell) and Take me home (Tom Waits).\n\nThe second album here, Nobody wants to be alone, is similar in style and quality. It includes more great songs such as A long and lasting love, Tonight tonight, the title track, Coming to the dance and Touch and go.\n\nIf you are a fan of Crystal's music, you will love these albums.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Throughout his ten year career as a performer, songwriter and producer, Tank has been both underrated and underpromoted. While he scored a huge hit in 2001 with \"Maybe I Deserve\", his debut album \"Force Of Nature\" was slow to catch on with audiences. On his next album, 2002's \"One Man\" in which he had a repeat of the same occurences. It didn't help matters that he had more success behind the scenes as a writer and producer. After 2003, he decided to put his career on hiatus, then later deciding not wanting to make music anymore- until a talk with actor\/fellow musician Jamie Foxx made him change his mind. in 2007, he released his third and final album on the Blackground Records label- 2007's \"Sex Love And Pain\".\n\nIn 2010, he released \"Now Or Never\" his first on the Atlantic Records label. The production of the album is largely handled by Tank and his production team Song Dynasty. Outside production comes from the Stereotypes (best known for Raheem DeVaughn's \"I Don't Care\") on \"Celebration\" with a scene-stealing guest spot from Drake. Jim Jonsin produces the ballad \"Scream\" while Kevin Barnes hands in the Chris Brown assisted \"Foreplay\". The song \"Emergency\" sounds dangerously close to Pleasure P's \"Under\", a song ironically written and produced by Tank. On most of the songs, the songs are sexually charged- something that sounds awkward on his behalf. Truth be told, Tank's strong point as a singer and songwriter is when he sings about heartbreak- whether he's the victor (See: The ballads \"Keep It 100\" and \"You Mean That Much\"), or the victim (See: His show-stopping cover of the Bonnie Raitt classic \"I Can't Make You Love Me\"). Even though it's nice to see him with a new album, the songs feel rushed and out of focus, which make for a somewhat underwhelming listen. In short, this album could have been a lot better than it was.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Mixtapes are a good way to keep your name circulating in between albums. The Clipse dropped two very good mixtapes since their last album \"Hell Hath No Fury\". The problem with mixtapes is nothing about it is original. Its nice to hear your favorite rapper rhyming over someone else's hit. But albums are where you make you money. Nobody else to blame but yourself. Their last album was critically acclaimed but that did not reflect in record sales. They haven't had a hit single since \"Grindin\". Now, the Thorton brothers are back to prove a point with \"Til' The Casket Drops\".\n\nThe Clipse are known for two things: \"coke rap\" and metaphors that would make Phife Dawg proud. The first thing you might notice is that The Neptunes are not responsible for the entire production on the album. That can be good and bad. Good because it shows the ability to step away from their comfort zone. Bad because it gets away from the sound they are known for. Veteran producers The Hitmen lend a hand on the lead off single \"Freedom\". \"Kinda Like A Big Deal\" is classic Clipse flow over a Neptunes beat featuring a weak 16 from Kanye West. \"Popular Demand (Popeyes)\" is what you would expect from a song featuring Cam'Ron. It makes no sense but the beat and hook is hot. \"I'm Good\" Ft. Pharrell is obviously a song for the club. But its catchy and grows on you.  Other standouts include the reggae-themed \"There Was A Murder\", \"Door Man\" & the reflective songs \"Footsteps\" & \"Life changes. This album is not without its flaws. \"All Eyes On Me\" ft. Keri Hilson is horrible. As well as \"Counseling\", \"Champion\" & \"Showing Out\" ft. Yo Gotti. What stands out is that all of the bad songs on this album are beats done by the Neptunes. (I always thought they were hit or miss). Overall this is a solid album. Not one of the best of the year but it will keep true hip hop fans pleased for now.\n\nBack in 1994, a rap group from Queensbridge named Mobb Deep were the hottest rap duo of the early 90's. With a classic second album and 2 good follow ups, they had the streets on lock with grimy tales of hood life. Now in 2009, a couple magazines had the Clipse as the \"greatest rap duo of all time\". That is a smack in the face to some of the greats like Gangstarr, Meth & Red, EPMD and Pete Rock & CL Smooth. The problem with the Clipse is they seem to have no identity. In the past they were the heads of the \"coke rap\" game. Now what are they about. Is it duffle bags, watches and sluts or do they wanna make you dance or are they street pushers.  It doesn't help when you don't get full attention from the Neptunes or your record label. Record sales have been the down fall of the Clipse career. Until they solve those problems, they will never dethrone Outkast as the greatest rap duo of all time.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Having just gotten burned by wasting two bucks on an early Brubeck (\"At Storyville\") with wretched, amateurish audio, I was braced for the worst when it came to hearing my other purchases of Amazon's bargain-priced albums.  Fortunately, the Brubeck album was apparently an aberration: the sound on this Clifford Brown session is better than I had a right to expect.\n\nListening to Clifford is to discover--with all due deference to Pops, Diz, Miles--the greatest trumpeter the music has known.  Like Scottie LaFaro, the bassist who was so instrumental toward the construction, along with Bill Evans, of a new jazz piano trio sound, Clifford left us at the age of 25 and was no less seminal than LaFaro.  Moreover, both musicians--unlike a Louis Armstrong or Jimmy Blanton--continue to represent not so much a breakthrough or revolutionary \"first step\" aa standard that almost 60 years later few if any successors have been able to equal let alone surprass.\n\nClifford didn't indulge himself in the \"tricks\" of his peers and successors--Harmon mutes, bent trumpet bells, wah wah pedals wired to the horn, half-valving, acrobatic trills--all were foreign to him--and of no use: he was an artist whose only language was about the creation of truth and beauty.  Or, to phrase it differently, Clifford was a pure \"Romantic\"--his formidable, unequaled technique always subservient to a \"musical idea\" that owed more to a vibrant, \"living\" tone and unapologetic melodicism than to any of the device employed by other musicians to be \"different\" or \"identifiable.\"\n\nThe playing of Herb Geller is simply another reason to pick up this recording.  A musician who's remained in Germany for much of the past half century, he shows he was far more than another West Coast player of the \"cool school\": on this recording, he places himself squarely in the tradition of Charlie Parker--as much a direct descendent of Bird as Sonny Stitt, Phil Woods, or Cannonball Adderley.\n\n[This performance practically demands comparison with an album of the same title by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Caravan-Keepnews-Collection\/dp\/B000PY30K8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Caravan: Keepnews Collection<\/a>.  You may save a few bucks by getting the original Riverside issue instead of the recently remastered one by Orrin Keepnews.  Either way, it's an instructive--and exhilarating--opportunity to compare the trumpets of Clifford and Freddie Hubbard as well as the percussion work of two thunder-bearers: Max Roach and Art Blakey.  And if you're into earth-moving music, compare the work of Buddy Rich on the same tune, from:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Blues-Caravan-Dig\/dp\/B0007KVAL6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Blues Caravan (Dig)<\/a>, which also features blazing solo work by flutist Sam Most, trumpeter Rolf Erickson and vibist Mike Mainieri.  This neglected performance represents, imo, some of Rich's most creative work on record.  Besides an opening drum solo, Buddy comes back for another solo while former Brubeck bassist, Wyatt Ruther, outlines the chord sequence with strong walking 4\/4 (I only wish more percussionists would opt for the same combination--drum solos are little more than acrobatic displays--unless the percussionist's contributions arise from the musical elements of the tune .  Buddy's solos on his two most famous \"vehicles\"--\"West Side Story Suite\" and \"Channel One Suite\"--could be exchanged or inserted in just about any uptempo tune.  His playing on \"Caravan\" and Horace Silver's \"Blowin' the Blues Away,\" on the other hand, is a striking, \"musical\" exception.\n\n[Explanation of my title: while I'm still having a bit more trouble with Amazon's Cloud than with Apple's, I've managed, with patience, to play the tunes I've purchased from Amazon on 2 computers and 3 hand-held devices.  Be sure to download \"Cloud Player\" from Amazon or iTunes, and the rest is automatic--more or, as is often the case, less.  And even if you prefer \"real\" records (LPs, CDs) to ethereal downloads, you've got to admit that being able to juxtapose trumpet players or drummers is greatly expedited by programs like iTunes and Cloud Player.]","classification":5,"fold":1}

Ms. Veirs is definitely not resting\non her laurels and hopefully will continue to evolve into deeper territory.\nIn my humble estimation she is one of the top songwriters working today,\nshe deserves more recognition.\nLaura Veirs, Laura Marling, Courtney Barnette, Angel Olsen, Valerie June,\nCold Specks, Marissa Nadler, etc.--the women are tearing it up!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"This is it!  This is the very first Hollywood Undead album that I ever discovered, and its the one that got me into their music in the first place!  I admittedly haven't been a fan for very long, but this album is the one that hooked me and got me to fall in love with HU, eventually causing me to go collect all their previous albums.\n\nHaving now experienced all their previous records, Day of the Dead feels like a good mixture of more light-hearted songs (like War Child) with more serious songs (Dark Places, Live Forever).  My particular favorite is How We Roll just because it is so high-energy and fun, plus I love the wordplay in the line, were packing heat because its cold out here  I also quite like the song Does Everybody in the World Have To Die for its slightly experimental-sounding backing music, along with the fascinating way the title phrase fluidly progresses from being a question to an affirmative statement.  Additionally, for anyone who misses Funny Mans deep, surprisingly sexy voice, youd better give Guzzle, Guzzle a listen (bonus song on the deluxe version).\n\nOh, and if you're wondering exactly which version to get (theres a normal deluxe version, an itunes bonus song version, and a version in Best Buy), definitely pick up the Best Buy version.  It comes with the regular deluxe tracks, but also the tracks Sing and F--- the World. While I do recommend you track down all the bonus songs if you can, Sing is absolutely the most beautiful song HU has yet released, so I strongly suggest you try to get the Best Buy version solely for that.  Even if you dont, though, Day of the Dead is still an excellent album in all respects, and any version of it is definitely worth owning.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Meek Mill ever since his MMG Debut has stuck to two formulas and has done very little in between. Dreams and Nightmares is no different, which for Meek Mill fans is a very good thing. Dreams and Nightmares is almost what you would expect from Dreamchasers 2 if they took out the freestyles and polished the crap out of it, which isn't a bad thing by any means. Dreams and Nightmares is without a doubt Meek Mill's best album to date and stands out as one of the best Hip Hop albums of 2012\n\nBeats [A-] One of Dreams and Nightmares greatest strengths. Meek has found a few good producers that fit his flow perfectly. Overall the album has some excellent beats that will very easily get stuck in your head. Best Beats: \"Lay Up\", \"Amen\", \"Believe It\", and \"Burn\"\n\nHooks [B+] This wasn't the main focus of the album which is fine, but with a few good guest features Meek is able to throw some radio-friendly hooks into the album. Best Hooks: \"Maybach Curtains\", \"Rich & Famous\", \"Lay Up\", and \"Amen\"\n\nFlow [A-] Meek sounds almost exactly the same in every song, but that isn't a bad thing by any means. Meek has a unique anxious and intense sound to his rapping that is really quite refreshing in comparison to other rappers out there. Best Flow: \"Believe It\", \"Young & Gettin It\", \"Lay Up\", and \"Burn\"\n\nLyrics [B] Rap cliche's out the wazoo on this album. Lots of lyrics about drugs, money and girls. But with the beats it works well enough, the time where meek shines the brightest is when he gets serious. Best Lyrics: \"Traumatized\", \"Tony Story (Pt. 2)\", \"Maybach Curtains\", and \"Who You're Around\"\n\nOriginality [C+] If you've heard anything Meek has done on Dreamchasers it's pretty much the same thing. On top of that, there isn't a ton of originality here, but it's still enjoyable, better lyrics would have been appreciated. Best Originality: \"Lay Up\", \"Amen\", \"Traumatized\", and \"Tony Story (Pt. 2)\"\n\nGuest Features [A] Probably the place where this album shines the brightest. Meek knows very well who should be in what song and when there shouldn't be a guest feature at all. Heck, he made Rick Ross and Kirko Bangz sound good, that is a feat that not many people can pull off. Thank heavens Drake was the only Young Money feature on the album. Best Guest Features: Drake in \"Amen\", Kirko Bangz in \"Young & Gettin It\", Big Sean in \"Burn\", and John Legend in \"Maybach Curtains\"\n\nSingles [A-] The singles were four of the five that really could have passed as singles (Lay Up being the fifth), but Meek dropped a few songs that really defined what the rest of the album was going to be which is nice because in music now a days the singles are usually the only songs worth listening to on the album. Singles: \"Amen\", \"Burn\", \"Young & Gettin It\", and \"Believe It\". Best Single: \"Amen\".\n\nAll in all Dreams and Nightmares by Meek Mill is really an impressive album that stands as one of the better rap albums of 2012.\nFINAL SCORE: A- (9\/10)\n\nAuthor's Note: I listened to this album when it leaked a day before it was released and was not impressed at all. I downloaded it so I had something new to listen to going on a road trip. I listened to the songs \"Burn\", \"Amen\", \"Traumatized\", \"Polo & Shell Tops\", \"Believe It\", and \"Young & Gettin It\", and I was just done after that. I didn't like it at all really, but after a few weeks I decided to give it another chance which I then liked it a little more. After another couple of weeks I noticed the gem \"Lay Up\" and that I actually really liked \"Young & Gettin It\". After repeating that a couple of times I decided that I absolutely loved this album and am still listening to it to this day. It went from an album that I listened to half of once to an album that's now sitting pretty as my 20th favorite album of all time.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"When this first came out over a decade ago from RCA Victor\/BMG it was an instant winner among those Big Band fans starving for some CD material presenting the music of that era in quality AAD sound. Unlike many releases at that time, it even has three paragraphs in the insert describing the usual reception for these renowned groups when their buses rolled into town, along with a re-listing of the generous (for the time) 19 tracks showing recording dates and locations.\n\nWith so much to choose from in terms of material, I have to agree with those who assigned 5 stars to the tracks presented here, each in its own way representative of the music so popular from 1933 to 1940 (the span covered here). And yes, even to the inclusion of Fletcher Henderson's Mary Had A Little Lamb, a 1936 recording featuring a brief vocal by Teddy Lewis, but some of the best instrumental solos ever put to disc. Really, the title and the lyrics are incidental.\n\nThe same reviewer who lamented that selection, also had disparaging remarks for the \"whitebread\" Casa Loma Stomp, only the first of 64 hits for Glen Gray & His Casa Loma Orchestra (named after a famed Toronto nightclub which the band called home for a spell) which hit # 15 in January 1931 (this is a 1933 re-recording), as well as Bunny Berigan's rendition of All God's Chillun Got Rhythm (with vocal by Ruth Bradley). Yes, trying to do that in today's society would go over like a lead balloon - but this was 1937 and that year both Duke Ellington (# 14 instrumental) and Artie Shaw (# 15 with vocal by Tony Pastor) had hits with it.\n\nTheir inclusion in this historical volume is just fine, thank you very much. As the blurb says on the reverse \"Foot-tappin' favorites & jumpin' jitterbugs from the Fabulous Swing Era! Over 64 minutes of the swingin'est singles ever!\" And at a pretty decent price I might add.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I've never heard of this label, but somebody sure did a great job of assembling 50 hits in a collection that's cheaper than buying two individual songs. In a category full of cover bands and re-recordings, it's great to hear true original songs, and their clarity is an unusual bonus for an oldies collection.\n\nOn the other hand, it's a darned shame that at least a one unmarked re-recording snuck into this set. Runaway is obviously not the original version. (That's the only one I'm sure about; perhaps other reviewers can find more.) At least half of these songs really are the originals, and the collection would be easily worth the money just for them. I would have given \"45 Real Originals\" a 5-star review, but the sour taste of a re-recording lowers my rating for \"50 (Mostly) Originals\" to 4 stars.","classification":4,"fold":1}

Unfortunately, it showed with the lackluster strength of Grafitti, and it is still showing right here on Deuces. His latest single is just not up to par on what it could be for him. He also had that not just in the song, but in his breaking down performance at the BET Awards suring his tribute to Michael Jackson on Man In The Mirror. I think honestly that Chris should really take a longer look into himself and then get back out there. He really hasn't shown that he is reallly ready for a full-length return, aces high but deuces low for Chris.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":1}

{"text":"Brandy matures beyond her years!\nThis is absolutely an amazing album. After the disappointing Aphrodisiac, I wondered if Brandy had any juice left to inspire the masses of music fans once again. I reassure music and Brandy fans alike that she does not fail to impress on this album. Her voice has come a long way. Shades of her original voice that made her famous are still visible but she uses her voice and tries different techniques which is great. There is real harmony in the way she sings this time around. The songs on here are very inspirational and the entire album has a theme of hope. Which I think is brilliant because America is so messed up right now that we could use some positive music and hope. This is definitely one of the few R&B albums released in recent years that really deliver the goods. Beyonce, Danity Kane, Day26, and Usher have all released nonsense. It's great to see Brandy on top of her game after an abysmal disgrace that was Aphrodisiac. Not sure how much of a comeback she will make as Beyonce has staked her claim as the only diva of R&B music. But on this release, Brandy, teams up once again with the hit-maker DarkChild, who was absent on her last album and a few other top notch hit makers on this release. It's great to see her working with Darkchild as i think they make a great duo. Pick this up and enjoy.\nStand out tracks are:\nLong Distance\nRight Here (Departed)\nShattered Heart and many others.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Brooklyn, NY emcee and Slaughterhouse member Joell Ortiz, who was for a time signed to Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment record label, takes time to make mental connections and stew over issues in his third solo LP, House Slippers. In the album, he deals with how he has evolved with hip hop over the years, his having to overcome obstacles in and out of the music business, and even his recent weight loss and lifestyle change to increased physical fitness. Joell Ortiz is obviously in a healthy place in life, considering the fact that he is performing this self examination with a grateful attitude. He is still that creative, hard edged emcee who raps with advanced lyricism. And for every filler track on House Slippers, there are three or four intelligent tracks to make up for them. In other words, the bulk of the album is made up of smart material. Ortiz has invited some rappers and some singers to appear on House Slippers and has even brought his Slaughterhouse group mates (Royce Da 5'9'', Joe Budden, and Crooked I) into the studio for \"Brothers Keeper\" to show that besides being a rap quartet, they are also a family. The production is handled mainly by The Heatmakerz and gives the album a sparkling yet rugged sound. This time around, Joell Ortiz is a more self aware artist who spits fire on the mic over nice hip hop beats. House Slippers is a good addition to his growing body of work.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Being FORCED to listen to 101.1 Fox FM everyday at work by a manager who THINKS he is a DJ, and THINKS EVERYONE LOVES the top 40, I have to hear the same ten top 10 songs EVERY SINGLE DAY, and they are driving me insane at how horrible each and every one of them are. Man the top 40 is the biggest joke EVER. Especially when it comes to these top 40 playing stations, who avoid the good music that reaches the charts once in a blue moon, and just plays this sort of rubbish, just because they are all paid to.\n\nThis particular song here is not a song. I don't care what kind of message it is portraying, a million other songs out there have messages and meanings too, so don't even for one second try to tell me this is unique or special. Just about every other artist out there writes lyrics from the heart, and have a soulful meaning, so quit thinking this one here is the only song that has ever been written to do so. Did I say song? I meant, this guy talking his lyrics out. There is no melody, no soul, no fun, and definitely no talent. At least artists who do these kind of things in the past added a rhythm, or a beat to it to keep it from sounding like a E-book with background sounds. Beck didn't bore you to death like this when they spoke out the lyrics, and at least they added a melodic chorus and showed they where musicians, unlike this guy who if he read this so called \"inspirational\" poem out without the trickery that it is a song, he would be booed off stage for someone else to come on and wake the rest of the audience up.\n\nThe vocals are just irritating, but who knows, maybe I could stand this song had it not been preformed by these untalented artists. They knew the song was so damn boring and they can't add melody because they can't sing, so they got Mary Lambert to come in and throw down whatever POS she could come up with to disguise this spoke words as a song. Hat's off to her for not using an auto-tuner, otherwise I would slam her down too, who ever she is, but even her lyrics and actual melody in this horrible song is not enough to make it worthy of 1 star.","classification":1,"fold":1}

{"text":"This is a nice collection of Duke Ellington music and a value for the price on offer. It is not a perfect collection, but overall this is a solid set.\n\nThe set concentrates on music from early in Ellington's career. His first hit in the US charts, from 1927 -- East St. Louis Toodle-oo is included, as are three of his five singles from the charts in 1928: Black and Tan Fantasy, Creole Love Call, and The Mooche. His last hit on the charts was in 1954, and of course he continued performing and writing more serious music (\"suites\") practically right up until his death in 1974. The latest recording included here appears to be I'm Beginning to See the Light, from 1945. (I hope I didn't miss anything, but as far as I can tell that's the case.)\n\nThere are a few small glitches in the sound. I mainly mean little digital pops and bloops that are artifacts created in the encoding process. I heard them only in a few places -- most prominently on \"Don't Get Around Much Anymore\" and \"Solitude\". According to what I have read in another review, these may be caused when a recording interface is pushed too hard, or there is not enough disk space, or the writing of the MP3 is not fast enough for some other reason, causing an overload of information and resulting in defects in the sound. Whatever the cause, I docked a star for this because I think this problem could have been avoided by using the proper equipment.\n\nThe other sound issue is that these are, of course, old recordings, and they sound like it. But that is inherit in any collection of early Duke Ellington music, so that's fair.\n\nOne could certainly quibble with the \"Best of\" title. Ellington had 78 records on the charts in 1927-1954. And many would regard his suites -- sometimes closer to classical music than bandstand jazz -- as his best, or at least most significant work. Still, this is a solid collection and a worthwhile buy. Recommended.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"For someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music, its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances, I find this CD one of the most beautiful recordings of all-time. Once again and as always, the great Nelson Riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standards from the Great American Songbook. This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.\n\nWith the superb instrumental skills of pianist Don Grolnick, drummer John Guerin, bassist Bob Magnusson, guitarist Bob Mann (who also played fabulously on Rod Stewart and Steve Tyrell's recordings) and the creative flair of concertmaster David Frisina, this CD offers some of the glowing moments of Ms. Ronstadt's musical career. \"Lush Life,\" \"What's New?\" and \"For Sentimental Reasons\" are three of the greatest and most beautiful albums of standards ever recorded.\n\nNobody sounded more expressive than Ms. Ronstadt singing \"When I Fall In Love,\" a song lamenting that love has ended even before it has begun. You can hear that beguiling guitar accompaniment by a fine guitarist, Bob Mann, complementing Ms. Ronstadt's exquisite voice. Likewise, nobody sounded so excruciatingly poignant with her moving rendition of \"When Your Lover Has Gone.\"\n\n\"What lonely hours\nThe evening shadows bring\nWhat lonely hours\nWith memories lingering\nLike faded flowers\nLife can't mean anything . . .\"\n\nIn \"Skylark,\" the singer made a mark on this song with her heartfelt rendition as she brings new life to this Johnny Mercer\/Hoagy Carmichael classic. She also left a lasting impression to one of Sinatra's signature songs \"I'm A Fool To Want You,\" just like Ol' Blue Eyes did with his meaningful interpretation. They both did the best versions for male and female vocals, respectively.\n\nShe swings lightly on Rodgers & Hart's gem \"You Took Advantage Of Me,\" then she takes it slower in Mills\/Parish\/Ellington's \"Sophisticated Lady.\" And picks up the light swing tempo again on \"Can't We Be Friends?\"\n\n\"Sophisticated lady I know\nYou miss the love you had long ago\nAnd when nobody is nigh\nYou cry. . . you cry.\"\n\nIf you're a lover of standards like me and an admirer of beauty in all its forms, you should have this CD in your collection and take pleasure in listening to its endless beauty.\n\nHere's to the magic of beautiful music!","classification":5,"fold":1}

But dare I say that I don't like this album by Chris? I ran out to buy it at Target on its release date but just couldn't love it. It's too much \"more of the same.\" It seems like Ed Cash insists on keeping all Chris's songs structured the same - an 8 measure intro, an 8 measure verse, an  8 measure chorus, a 4 measure verse or the first half of the first verse, the chorus, a bridge, repeat chorus, end. The drums, bass and guitars are dull and unimaginative as well.\n\nI LOVED \"Awake My Soul\" with Lecrae and that's the only song that made my iPod from the album. Download this song. It's one of the only songs worth owning.\n\n\"Whom Shall I Fear\" is just boring. Four on the floor throughout it, boring music. Yawn.\n\n\"Lay Me Down\" is lyrically weak, some phrases making no sense. \"Hand on my heart, this much is true, there's no life apart from you\" is a perfect example of that. It's another 4 on the floor song that sounds like a knock off of the sound on Mumford and Sons song \"I Will Wait.\" You can lay this song's lyrics right over that song's music.\n\n\"God's Great Dance Floor\" is an OK song. I do like the mariachi trumpet but the 4 on the floor beat gets monotonous. I also don't like the build going into the bridge. It sounds messy and chaotic.\n\n\"White Flag\" is a down tempo anthem type song. While I like most of the lyrics, the music is suspiciously similar to Jesus Messiah from his 2008 album. Another 4 on the floor song with a snare cadence.\n\n\"Crown Him\" is likable. Chris enjoys taking hymns and adding a new chorus or bridge. It breathes fresh life into an old song. This is a good one to download too.\n\n\"Jesus Son of God\" is another 4 on the floor slow ballad type of song.\n\n\"Sovereign\" is the only song I love on the album besides \"Awake.\"\n\n\"Countless Wonders\" recycles phrases and lyrics from earlier songs on his first albums.\n\n\"Thank you for saving me\" is yet another 4 on the floor song with cliche's throughout.\n\nBasically if you like every song where the kick drum is playing on every beat (called 4 on the floor), then this is your album. Personally when all 12 songs are like that, I get bored with it. It pains me to say this is Tomlin's weakest album but it is.","classification":2,"fold":1}

{"text":"\"The goal of Motown was clear in the logo they printed on their record jackets: \"The Sound of Young America\". It was no longer about black and white. The lucrative market was teenagers and it was biracial. Berry Gordy understood that in this climate the music would have to change, too, and he would have to introduce \"a brand new beat\", a new sound. He was in search of the Motown sound. And it would have to be a sound that would work well on small transistor radios and car radios, their radios.\" -- pp. 85-86 \"Ready For A Brand New Beat: How \"Dancing In The Street\" Became The Anthem For a Changing America\"\n\nIf there was one thing Berry Gordy Jr. was not looking for it was controversy. As spring melted into summer in 1964 Motown records was well on its way to becoming the most successful independent record label in America. Gordy had perfected a formula for churning out bright, exciting pop tunes that appealed to teens of all races. On July 31, 1964 Motown released a pulsating new single by Martha and the Vandellas. It was supposed to be a party song. What Berry Gordy could not have possibly known was that \"Dancing In the Street\" would become the anthem for the young people who would take to the streets in the years that followed protesting everything from racial discrimination, our escalating involvement in Vietnam and police brutality.\n\nJust two days after \"Dancing In the Street\" was released, events took place that would eventually lead to the escalation of the war in Vietnam. In 1964, 17 year olds comprised the largest age group in America. These young people were still too young to vote but they quickly came to the realization that as soon as they turned 18 they could be drafted to fight in a war in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, more than 700 college students travelled to the Deep South to help register black voters in what would come to be known at the Mississippi Freedom Summer. In just a matter of days three of these young people would turn up missing and eventually be found dead. Meanwhile, riots erupted in Harlem after a 15 year old African-American male was shot and killed by a white policeman. Similar outbursts would occur in Elizabeth, NJ, Chicago and in Jacksonville, FL. Then in February, 1965 the black human rights activist Malcolm X was gunned down in New York City. He was 39. Malcom X never bought into the civil rights movement and had urged every black person to own a gun. He firmly believed that \"only violence or the threat of violence will get results.\" It would not be long before cries of \"Black Power\" would supplant the non-violent protests of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Tensions were mounting and the carefree existence that most of America's teenagers had known was quickly evaporating. Still, for the vast majority of American teenagers \"Dancing In the Street\" was nothing more than an up-tempo dance tune. But for those who were not content to remain silent, for those who took to the streets, \"Dancing In The Street\" took on an entirely new meaning. As the author recalls: \"Unknown to Reeves, the theme song of these disruptions around the country, or \"cross the nation,\" just like \"Burn, baby, burn\" in Watts was \"Dancing In The Street\". Strangely, the uprisings, too, often took on a party spirit.\" To this day, Martha Reeves insists that it was nothing but a party song.\n\n All these years later and for a variety of reasons, \"Dancing In The Street\" remains one of the most popular tunes to emerge from the 1960's. The tune sounds as fresh and vibrant today as it did the day that it was recorded. To date, there have been some 35 cover versions of this tune. And if you would like to learn more about all of these events I would highly recommend Mark Kurlansky's excellent book to you.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Oh, man, I am going to ruffle SO many feathers with this review! See, unlike pretty much everyone else who's reviewed it so far, I DON'T love Dale Watson's latest, CARYIN' ON. At times I find it repeatative, other times unoriginal and dull. There are even moments where Watson seems to have become what he's always hated most...formulistic and calculated, just cranking out the music because it's time to crank out more music.\n This doesn't mean I hate the album, though. In fact, there are a number of very nice moments, and I'm liking the disc a little more now than I did, say, after the first two or three listens, so all you die-hard D.W. fans can sheath your claws! :>) (In fact, I'd go so far as to say that this is a 3.5 star disc, but it just doesn't warrent rounding up). The fact of the matter is, Watson is in a rut, releaseing the same album year after year. Thing is, they're getting weaker with each release.\n The album's opening cut, \"Carryin' On This Way\", is a prime example...this song is more Glen Campbell than Merle Haggard or George Jones. With it's lilting gait, this is nothing more than easy-listening country, something I would never have expected from Watson six or seven years ago. Sadly, the strong lyrics about growing up are completely underminded by the weak arrangement.\n Far better is the swingin' \"Hey Brown Bottle.\" Watson's lead vocal is strong and assured, with a hint of sex and sass to it, while the arrangement is clever, allowing the instrumentation to shine thru, both individually and collectively ((Yes, the backing vocals border on cheesy, but they're still kind of fun!).\n Things take another step back with \"Flower In Your Hair\", a peppy little number that's just this side of pop. However, the track is saved by it's overall romanticism and Watson's smooth vocal. Make no mistake about it....he has one of the best voices in pop music today, regardless of the genre.\n \"You're Always On My Mind\" is classic Country. In fact, if I didn't know better, I would swear this was a cover from the 60's! Relaxed and romantic, it's full of fiddle and steel guitar in just the right spots. Toss in a perfectly understated lead vocal, and...WOW!\n \"Ain't That Livin'\" is sort of like musical cotton candy...light and fluffy, with nothing to it really, but, oh, so sweet and good! Watson's lead vocal has a sort of twinkle to it that's both captivating and intriguing, resulting in a throwaway track that turns into so very much more.\n \"Heart Of Stone\" is probably the disc's best track. Not only is there a real depth to the cut, there's also a sense of growth and honesty. This is the Dale Watson I fell in love with after discovering 2001's EVERY SONG I WRITE IS FOR YOU. He's stretching again here, and that's something I want to see more of on future releases!\n I have no idea what's being said on most of \"I'll Show Ya\", but I really don't care...the song is so infectious and fun, well, you can't help but love it! Bounding along at a break-neak pace, Watson's vocal swoops and soars, anchored by a lively arrangement. Love it!\n \"How To Break Your Own Heart\" veers VERY close to retro camp, but another nice lead vocal and subdued instrumentation pull the song back from the brink. (Retro walks a very fine line between camp and flavoring your own style...Watson's always been on the right side of the fence, but he's starting to teeter more and more).\n Far stronger is \"For A Little While.\" Some might think of this as nothing more than an Elvis-soundalike outtake, but I love the flamenco feel to it. Graced with gorgeous pedal steel and acoustic guitar, the song just kind of flows out of the speakers. Once again, this is a nice, new mood, and one Watson should persue again in the future.\n I'm on the fence over \"Whatever\"...there's certainly nothing new or fresh to the cut ~ Watson has mined this territory before ~ but the song is still enjoyable. An upbeat arrangement (highlighted by Pig Robbins' wonderful piano runs!) just bounds along, while Watson's lead vocal is supple and spirited. Let's call this one a draw.\n \"Your Love I'm Gonna Miss?\" Not so much. Watson has developed a (bad) habit of putting older material on each of his recent new releases, but unlike, say, Joan Jett, who frequently rerecorded old Runaways songs on some of her newer solo albums, there's nothing new here....these are note-for-note the same cuts. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this was actually taken from the EVERY SONG I WRITE....masters! That's just kind of lazy and....chintzy!\n \"Don't Want To Go Home Song\" has a nice groove to it. Watson's silky lead vocals just roll over the spirited Western swing arrangement, with fiddle, piano and pedal steel all in the forefront. This, too, is nothing new for Watson, but at least it comes across as fresh and alive, vs. just...routine. Another winner!\n The disc closes with the campy \"Hello, I'm An Old Country Song.\" I know Watson's heart is in the right place, but this is just trying WAY too hard! Instead of honest and heart-felt, it comes across as cliched and over-the-top, with a dash of bitteress and a dose of sour grapes tossed in for good measure. Are Emmylou Harris, Marty Stuart, George Jones and Rodney Crowell, to name just a few, being treated properly by Country radio? Heck, no. But that doesn't mean new artists like Miranda Lambert and Chris Young aren't honoring those who've come before them! Commendable concept....failed execution.\n So, what is it that I want from Dale Watson? What is it that his last few releases, but particularly CARRYIN' ON, aren't giving me? First, I'd have to say it's the \"WOW!\" factor....when I first heard EVERY SONG I WRITE IS FOR YOU and WONDERLAND, I was just blown away by the voice, the energy, the VIBE....it was new and exciting and unlike anything else out there! Now, it's like it's just time to put another album out.\n Second, I want less formula and more spontinaity....back in the day when Watson was all about jeans and tee-shirts and dirty black engineer boots, there was an edge and an unpredictability to him. Now that he's transitioned into suits and polished snakeskin boots, well, all the life and wonder has been sucked out of him. Sadly, he's become pretty much what he's fought against all these years...predictable.\n Obviously, most fans don't feel this way, as per the other reviews, but I can honestly say this may be my last Dale Watson record for a while. And that's too bad. (As with all my reviews, I'm docking the disc half a star for not including the lyrics).","classification":3,"fold":1}

We used this song at my husband's funeral and it was so moving and touching to everyone there.  After the funeral, everyone commented about what a beautiful service it was, and I had to put the entire funeral together since I didn't have the money for an elaborate funeral home service.  At least 40 people came to me and just went on and on about what a beautiful, beautiful service it was, and I think it was because of the music tracks we selected.  We played a couple of songs and then someone spoke and we tried to make the music a remembrance of him plus be a comfort to those in attendance. Now that it's been two months since my dear sweet husband's passing, still hearing this makes me think of him and is a comfort, but of course it still makes me cry.  I miss him so.\nLyrics:\nAlways, you will be part of me. And I will forever feel your strength when I need it most.\nYoure gone now, gone but not forgotten.

{"text":"California band Weezer have long been critical darlings in the alternative rock circuit. They cemented their legacy with their 1994 self-titled debut (Also known as \"The Blue Album\") followed up by great but commercially underperforming \"Pinkerton\". They took a five year hiatus before returning  in 2001 wit a series of albums: \"Weezer\" (Which, like their debut, was produced by The Cars frontman Ric Ocasek), the self-produced \"Maladroit\" and their biggest album to date - the Rick Rubin produced \"Make Believe\". They then returned with their third self-titled album (\"The Red Album\"), their final album for Geffen Records, the noticeably pop \"Raditude\" and their only album for Epitaph, 2010's \"Hurley\". After a four year hiatus, they returned to Universal Music Group one last time for 2014's critically acclaimed \"Everything Will Be Alright In The End\". Although the band has been a fan favorite, they have periodically angered them over their desires to make blatant pop music. Although, to be fair, frontman Rivers Cuomo hasn't shied away from his love of pop records. In fact, he frequently cited the Beach Boys founding member Brian Wilson as a primary influence on his songwriting. So, it should be a surprise to no one when Weezer decided to make an album influenced by the beach - hence their fourth self titled effort. Known better as \"The White Album\", the album could have been referred to as \"The Summer Album\" due to the album's cover and the overall theme of having fun in the summertime. Joining them for the production of \"Weezer\" is the producer Jake Sinclair, who's no stranger to pop music - having produced albums for the pop band Five Seconds Of Summer.\n\nDespite not being a concept album, musically, the album plays out like a love letter to a summer weekend in California. The album starts off with \"California Kids\" about having a good time. On the song \"Wind In Our Sail\", Rivers sings of a couple being happy alone sailing the seas.  On the celebratory anthem \"Thank God For Girls\", they work in a sample of \"Trilogy\" by little known prog rock band December's Children. \"(Girl We Got A) Good Thing\" recalls the sound of 70's AM radio while celebrating the fact that romance blossoms between a couple. \"Do You Wanna Get High\" details a man reluctantly agreeing to engage in excessive drug use with a female friend. On \"King Of The World\", a man wishes to have a fun time with his female friend despite all of the negative things going on around them. \"Summer Elaine And Drunk Dori\" as well as \"L.A. Girlz\" recall Weezer's earlier work while they sing of a man's emotional conflict over his new love on the pop friendly \"Jacked Up\". They close the album with \"Endless Bummer\", where a man regrets being in a relationship with a much younger woman. Their self-titled fourth effort may lean towards pop, but this time around the band got the balance right to please their fan base, music critics and the mainstream audience. Nearing 25 years into their career, Weezer show that they still have it and can bring their best work when they are focused. This album - as well as their previous album - can hold up well with their best work...not an easy feat for many, but Weezer definitely made their case here.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Along with the Bach Guild Beethoven Box, this is a \"must\" for those of us hoarding great Beethoven recordings. From what I've listened to so far, the sound quality here is really outstanding - extremely spacious, clear and well-balanced with no undue spotlighting on individual instruments. In contrast, the Bach Guild sounds warmer and more resonant, while still generally pleasing.\n\nI've never heard of most of the performers, but so far they're excellent, showing real personality without trying to sound different for the sake of being different. The one superstar gig I recognize, Rudolf Firkusny playing the \"Emperor Concerto\", is tasteful, understated and elegant while still displaying individuality.\n\nThere is a snafu starting with Track 89. It repeats the same identical tracks which were already included. How did that happen? Were they that desperate to get to the magic 100? Or did the wrong tracks get included between 89 and 99? A nice thing about the Amazon Cloud is that this could be corrected anytime to enable buyers to redo their downloads. Alas, the Bach Guild has seldom taken advantage of this to correct their many snafus, and instead withdrew their Symphony Box #2 from the market. But at these prices, it's hard to complain too much.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Amy Winehouse is gone.  The news is sad for many reasons, but it does drive us back to our CD collection to reevaluate her gifts - and they were extraordinary. This 2 CD album is probably her best known and certainly the number of Grammy Awards would indicate that.  Just the lead song 'Rehab' is worth the price of the recording.\n\nWinehouse created a sensation both in the musical world with what was indelibly her own style.  Many of us felt at first like this was another Janis Joplin, not only in her committed delivery but also in her drug abusive life.  It seems like every generation has a wounded sparrow - Edith Piaf, Billie Holiday, Janis Joplin. And like those who came before her she was as much a star off stage as she was on stage.  Now at age 27 she is gone, but with songs such as Rehab,  You Know I'm No Good,  Just Friends, Back To Black,  Love Is A Losing Game and Tears Dry On Their Own her memory will live on.  She was a one of a kind for this generation and it is difficult to say goodbye.  Grady Harp, July 11","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"These are beautiful tones. Cellular resonation very good. Results in stress release, cellular\/energy balancing, promoting health through the balance of vibration, tone and frequency.\n\nThis is more than just listening to music. This enhances your bodies natural vibration at 528hz; totally misaligned by the bombardment of EMF frequencies and the white noise of marketing, vehicles, LIFE.\n\nHighly recommended. Can't beat the price for what you get. Compared to medical costs, Source Vibrations is pennies on the dollar.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTE:\n\nBE AWARE: once you attune yourself to the Solfeggio scale listening to most other music becomes challenged. This is because the Solfeggio scale is an ancient sound system based upon six tones: Ut RE MI FA SOL LA, unlike todays music chaotic in the 12 tone temperament scale. Solfeggio brings peace, harmony, balance, health. The temperament tones encourage chaos, confusion, illness. Once it was realized how Solfeggio 'liberated' people from controlling interests the Solfeggio scale was replaced.\n\nOriginally all the Psalms and the Hymn of St. John were Solfeggio. Most East Indian music is tuned to Solfeggio and a lot of Celtic music as well. Rock n' Roll, metal ... well, all you have to do is look around at the confusion and chaos of the nations: disease rampant world-wide.\n\nThis is one reason Solfeggio Tuning\/music is so important. It is a baby step in bringing our body\/body systems back to their 528hz, our norm vibration: returning our energy and cellular systems catapulted into the fight or flight mode back into a harmonic frequency. Got nothing to loose by experimenting with the Solfeggio Harmonics.","classification":5,"fold":1}

Released\n  in 2011, Rockpango (it mean Rock Party in Spanish) would present both critics and\n  listeners a new and diverse form on the trademark Texican Rock as it expand upon\n  their roots-based rock and roll that truly defines Los Lonely Boys.  Showcased with\n  an exhilarating track set of new classics including American Idle, Fly Away, Love In\n  My Veins, 16 Monkeys (one of their more comical jams and beloved hits), the folk-\n  rock song Smile and the title track, this CD includes the powerful song Change The\n  World (not to be confused by the Eric Clapton classic) as it confronts the social and\n  economic troubles from the late-2000s and early-2010s, which also gives us a ray\n  of hope.  Also for fans of the band who happens to have children, they may want to\n  be cautious of the track Porn Star, which means the fans may want to be vigilant of\n  it (in reality, the porn industry is very dangerous, mostly corrupt, riddled with abuse\n  and can increase prejudice against women and homosexuals), but you will find this\n  entire album to be a truly highly enjoyable masterpiece while the deluxe edition will\n  even present you a recorded in-the-studio 24-minute Outtakes rehearsal track that\n  features the band clowning around and practicing, which make this the perfect buy.\n  Now Lets Partee With Los Lonely Boys!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"It used to be a tradition. From 1997 to 2005, Sevendust would release a new album every other autumn. Something about their music seemed to fit the season. The beautiful melodies and crushing heaviness paired well with the transition from the warmth of summer into the colder weather and darker days that autumn foreshadows. Now, for the first time in ten years, Sevendust help us bring in October with \"Kill The Flaw,\" the band's 10th full-length album of completely new material and it's no coincidence that it sounds right at home (pun intended) with the band's earlier releases.\n\nWhile \"Kill The Flaw\" stays true to the chugging nature of both \"Cold Day Memory\" and \"Black Out The Sun,\" the band have clearly incorporated a bit of the spirit of \"Time Travelers & Bonfires,\" the acoustic album they released just last year. This makes it the band's most diverse and \"full\"-sounding record since the return of guitarist and main song-writer Clint Lowery and thus, the most Sevendust have sounded like Sevendust in a good long time. Truth be told, \"Kill The Flaw\" sounds like it could have been produced during the salad days of \"Home,\" \"Animosity\" or even \"Seasons.\" It's a natural progression of a familiar sound and a band just getting better at what they do best. \"Thank You\" and \"Peace and Destruction\" are pretty standard modern Sevendust fare, combining frontman Lajon Witherspoon's soulful delivery with some influence from modern metal (and even a little bit of thrash). As the album progresses, however, things really start to get interesting. \"Letters\" and \"Cease and Desist\" combine melancholy melodies with the emotional and textural heaviness that made \"Animosity\" such a high watermark for the band back in the day. Then you have the oddly titled \"Chop,\" which integrates the band's fondness for country and southern-flavored music (these are good ol' boys from Georgia, after all) that is often hinted at in their music, but rarely realized. And to wrap it all up in a nice bow, there's the crushing closer (a staple at this point) of \"Torched\" to burn the whole thing down to the ground.\n\nSo while Sevendust may not make the best soundtrack for apple picking and hayrides, it's nice to have a new record from the guys to help bring in what this reviewer firmly believes to be the best of all seasons. And as always, it's comforting to know that despite adversity, Sevendust are still around, pushing forward long after so many of their peers have reached their expiration date. You'd be hard-pressed to find a flaw in \"Kill The Flaw,\" so get ready to dig your talons into some of the finest hard-rock that only Sevendust can deliver.","classification":5,"fold":1}

Listening to this sounds like a bastard child of Aphex Twins, David Byrne & Brian Eno. The typical Trent Reznor use of distorted pianos and guitar used to link his songs in The Fragile are here, but with the shortness of each track, he challenges himself to come up with 40 different themes. It's like his own audio museum where you move from painting to painting. You recognize the brush strokes and the technique while the subject and colors are in constant transition. Like a painting, especially contemporary ones, they often require focus and concentration to get the most out of it. And like artists will do, occasionally a work fails to impress or the message gets lost in noise and distortion. But for the most part, Ghosts succeeds in staying fresh, suspenseful,  inventive, and imaginative. No you won't be humming these during your drive home or your morning workout. Trent wants to haunt your head, not to scare you. And in that regards, it works.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"This Green Hill One Hour Of Spa Music is beautiful and soothing and for me so relaxing. For me, I have found several uses for this very soothing music:\n\n1) Daytime use - So I like to listen to this music as a soothing background music (turned down low). Then as I am sitting at my computer, I type my documents, read email, or go onto the web while listening to this music. (Sometimes I listen to this using my headset so that I listen and turn up the sound when others are in the room).\n\n2) Other daytime use - If I need a break, I turn this music on in my tablet and lie down for one hour and just relax. After that hour, I am rested, relax and ready to go on with my day.\n\n3) Nighttime use - What a wonderful sleep aid! This soothing music I listen to to relax and fall asleep and it works.\n\nDownloaded this whole album free from Amazon and the price FREE!\n\nHighly recommend this!","classification":5,"fold":1}

The sound on these Bach Guild downloads in each case seems to me a considerable improvement over my old Vanguard Classics CDs. The Bach Guild highs are brighter, the bass notes are richer, and there is overall a greater sense of presence and detail, with all of this more vivid sound nicely in balance. I don't any longer have my old LPs of Russell Sherman's famous set of the Transcendental Etudes, but I'm sure that the sound here is a MASSIVE improvement over those LPs.\nBach Guild makes no claims for remastering their mp3 releases, but I'm convinced that one reason these Boxes (Big, Little, and Little Big) are generally so satisfactory is that the sound is consistently very-good-to-excellent, and in most cases better than previous CD reissues (at least when I've been able to directly check.)","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"What better way to get into the holiday spirits than with a piece of poo? Mr. Hankey and friends deliver 45 minutes worth of foul-mouthed & high spirited Christmas tunes. Some are originals and some are just completely butchered reworkings. If you've seen the South Park episode of the same name, you are familiar with only half the content of this CD. The rest of it is just as much of a treasure. Sure, everyone's heard \"Christmas Time In Hell\" and \"Merry F'ing Christmas,\" but the best songs are the ones that slip under the radar. \"The Most Offensive Song Ever\", a duet between Mr. Hankey and Kenny proves to be just that, focusing on Virgin Mary. Cartman's \"Swiss Colony Beeflog\" comes as a favorite to me. Little Eric reaches Bruce Springsteen type singing when yearning for that one thing that truly makes Christmas special. \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing\" is done very hilariously and sloppily by the South Park Children's Choir and Stan's sister Shelly lisps her way through \"I Shaw Shree Ships\" ... I mean \"I Saw Three Ships.\" Heck, the album cover alone is incentive enough for you to purchase this CD. Since the time I've had it, I have enjoyed Christmas 100% more.

{"text":"Heavy As A Feather is one of those rare albums that comes along every so many years and takes you to a place you had forgotten, a place of serenity and peace, but also a place of memories.\nMusically this album is a total gem, from the art work to the very production itself you could not go wrong.\nThe start of the album has a wonderful almost classical feel, with a little hint of romance through the track \"Mountain Laurel\" While the second piece has the stunningly beautiful work of Eugene Friesen (cello), who almost illuminates the piece to a sultry glory and is called quite aptly Meadow Morning.\nHeavy has to be regarded as a quantum leap of an album with musicians of such gentle but passionate quality as seen in track three one of my favourites, which is named \"An Empty street in Prague\" and one can almost hear ones heels moving with intent down the cobbled streets of that famous city at dusk.\nKaye brings hope to the darkening season of Autumn with the track \"Wind In The Tall Autumn Grass\" and its flows through a timeless procession of latent summer memories with a wonderful duel of Piano and Cello.\nWe now weave like a new worn carpet into the world of a soft and love felt piece called \"So Much Sky\" here Kaye melds both light and dark in this composition and during the music, on what is the shortest track on the album.\nInto the deep now with \"Earth and with the strings once more in an alliance of beauty we are whisked upon the glory of a heart felt journey into a paradise of music and peaceful place on the ground where you can lay your head on the warm Earth and watch the clouds skim by in total safety and joy this is the longest piece on the album, but one to take your time with.\nWith talents like Will Ackerman (guitar), Charlie Bisharat (violin), Eugene Friesen(cello), Tony Levin(bass),Tom Eaton(accordion, percussion), Jill Haley(English horn), Michael Manring (fretless bass) and Ramesh (percussion) one knows that an album of true quality and style will be the resultant package and is.\nHeavy as a Feather has been one of those albums to review that you could almost cry while writing, its so full of an emotive quality sadly lacking today in many releases, \"Summer Afternoon\" and \"How Deep How Simple\" are tracks that will prove that point and with my all-time album selection \"Dusk At Rock House Creek and the title track this, album is a real step up to the plate by Kathryn Kaye.\nA gentle finish with One Quiet Last Breath which ushers in a Tibetan Bell, a unique and masterful way to finish what has and will be regarded as a truly masterful album in years to come.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Seth MacFarlane's debut album impresses me; I never knew he could sing so well! True, some will say he's not quite on a par with Sinatra and the likes of the \"Rat Pack;\" and they have an undeniable point. Nevertheless, Seth sings these songs with a certain passion that is very convincing; he comprehends the importance of feeling emotions in the lyrics of these songs and it shows in his very good performance here. The duets with Norah Jones and Sara Bareilles work well and that's a plus. In addition, the sound quality is excellent and I like that artwork, too.\n\nThere's really not a dud in the bunch; this is a solid debut CD and it makes me want more from Seth! He writes well in the CD liner notes; the big band\/50's-60's type musical arrangements by Joel McNeely work very well. I also like the way Seth chose a mixture of pop songs--some quite popular when they were first introduced and others which are not too well remembered in our times.\n\nOf course, I have my personal favorites on this album as you will, too. \"It's Anybody's Spring\" and \"Music Is Better than Words\" start the track set off with Seth singing from the heart; the music that accompanies him enhances the songs even more. Seth croons beautifully on \"Anytime, Anywhere\" while \"The Night They Invented Champagne,\" a Lerner and Loewe classic from \"Gigi,\" gets the royal treatment from Seth who delivers this without ever letting go of a single superfluous note! \"Two Sleepy People\" features Norah Jones performing a duet with Seth; they sound great together and I hope they collaborate again! \"You're The Cream in My Coffee\" is easy on the ear while \"Something Good\" is most romantic. \"Nine O'Clock\" just plain sounds good and we get another duet, this one with Seth and Sara Bareilles who perform \"Love Won't Let You Get Away\" with panache.\n\n\"It's Easy to Remember\" and a number from \"The Music Man\" entitled \"The Sadder But Wiser Girl\" also demonstrate Seth's ability to do a cover song with sensitivity; and listen for another gem when Seth MacFarlane sings his rendition of \"Laura.\" \"You and I\" is very well done and the album ends strong with Seth performing \"She's Wonderful Too.\"\n\nSeth MacFarlane proves he has the vocal chops to sing alongside the best of them on this album. People who treasure classic pop vocals recorded the way they were recorded when the \"Rat Pack\" ruled will want this album for their collections. I hope we get more CDs by Seth and it would be terrific if he did a concert tour, too!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Metallica is boldly and appropriately named as it's virtually impossible to have any meaningful discussion about the Heavy Metal genre without any mention being made about the vast impact that this band has made over the 80s and up to the mid 90s.  They lifted up the genre from mindless, juvenile topics of wild sex, drugs and fast cars to discussions about serious topics from the meaninglessness of war to environmental disasters and so forth.  What U2 did for pop\/rock, Metallica did for Metal in blending intelligent topics with very, very good musicianship and hence making the genre more accessible to a much wider audience than ever before.  In doing so, they extended the life of Metal and ensured an audience at a time when people were more interested in synth-pop ala Eurythmics, Depeche Mode, Howard Jones etc.  Metal owes a great debt to this band for ensuring the endurance and evolution of the genre to what it is to this day.\n\nThis version of the 1984 album comes in a mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) design which is very, very well executed and is one of the best that I've ever seen.  The gatefold sleeve is made from very good quality thick cardboard and assembled so well that you don't fear it coming apart easily once the glue starts to get old.  Also included is a 12 page booklet with all the lyrics in Japanese.  For the English ones you'll need a good magnifying glass to read it from the gatefold sleeve itself which very faithfully replicates the original lp design.\n\nUnfortunately, the sound quality is the same as it was in the original release and hence has not been remastered.  Although good by 1980s standards, the quality is not as good as what we have become used to with all the releases that have been well remastered these days.  For this reason, although the content is very good, I cannot give this version 5 stars as it's hard to justify the value proposition here as you are effectively paying for the mlps design only if you already have the album.  I suppose if you don't already have this or if you are a big fan of well-designed and executed mlps sleeves then you may be tempted to cough up the mulah for this.  If the sound had been remastered and hence improved over the original cd, I would have no hesitation to give this the full 5 stars and to recommend that you part with your hard-earned dough for this.  With \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" and \"Fade To Black\" you are getting two of Metallica's best ever tracks here and again contentwise you can't fault this album but you'll have to decide if the overall value proposition of this version of the album is worthy of the upgrade.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"When Taylor Swift debuted with her first big single \"Teardrops on my Guitar\", in 2007, she looked like she was going to be another pleasant, but quickly forgettable, entry into the safe pop-country genre.  Instead, Taylor has shown a incredible ability to adapt, evolve and mature as a musician.  She has managed to do this without needing to completely re-invent herself, either (like Madonna).  The result has been a very enjoyable journey through musical catalog throughout the years.\n\n  The latest example of her musical evolution is her stunning \"1989\" album, which has already produced creative #1 hits in \"Shake It Off\" and \"Blank Space\".  This newest single, \"Style\", shows Taylor's ability to incorporate many different genres into her songs.  Anyone who is a fan of The Who will instantly recognize the syncopated funk-pop beat that permeates \"Style\".  When I first heard this song, the first thing that came to mind was The Who's \"Eminence Front\".  And, rather than just being a blatant ripoff that song's riff, \"Style\" embraces and pays tribute to that beat while making it work with its own lyrics.\n\n  This is another major step forward for Taylor.  It continues to make her an artist to watch, even after 8 years at the forefront of the industry.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I remember hearing \"Love Calls\" being played on the radio at work all the time, and the DJ never said who made the song. Maybe the DJ didn't know, because nobody else did either. When I finally found out the song was from a newcomer named Kem and that his album Kemistry was out, my brother and sister told me to pick the album up. And boy, talk about good advice.\nSince \"Love Calls\" is the first single, it's probably also the most recognizable song on the album - but I don't know if I would necessarily say it's the best song. Not to say it isn't a great song, but there are other great tracks too, like \"Inside\" (no, it's not about sex) and the gospel-flavored \"This Place\". And \"Brotha Man\" is a great storytelling track.\nWith ten tracks at around 47 minutes, it's clear that Kem isn't a debut artist who's trying to overprove himself. And he doesn't need to, because every song on this album is great. So why isn't he getting the recognition he deserves? Probably because he's on Motown, the label that seems to only promote artists when they feel like it (see also Remy Shand). But hopefully Kem will soon sell several copies of this great release.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"This song was at the beginning of a DVD based on the Monterey Pop Festival, called The Outtake Performances.

The theme is\n\nWhen we met I was sure out to lunch\nNow my empty cup is as sweet as the punch\n\nI tend to like simpler songs. In introducing the collective mentality that makes up The Association as a multiplicity coming together, it put the focus on each individual adding something like transistorized bits of what people hear on the radio. Watching so many people take turns with a line in this song made it surprising that a mess could sound this good. All of them allowed the good parts to come back a few times instead of growing like World War One, World War Two, a Cold War, the war on weed and money laundering.","classification":5,"fold":1}

Kina had a cover online and it showed up in the list. I listened and loved her pure, sweet voice, her friendly style, and straight ahead natural performances. I soon discovered a huge repertoire of Kina's online YouTube performances, many of which I enjoyed very much and I have followed her blossoming career since that time.\n\n\"Stairwells\" collects many of her best songs (there's also a new deluxe CD just released) and is a delightful collection for anyone who enjoys music in a very open, approachable style relying heavily on talent and performance more than gimmicks. Check out YouTube, if you have any doubts, but I can hardly believe anyone would hesitate to grab such beautiful music for less than the price of a quick lunch. \"\n\nCheck it out here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Stairwells\/dp\/B004NCOQII\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stairwells<\/a>","classification":5,"fold":1}

This is simply a slightly remastered version of Dave Mustaine's 2004 Remixed and Remastered collection which not only remasters the recording but also changes things in it as well. So this is NOT the original. Why Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab called this an original is beyond me and why they needed to remaster a remaster from 2004 is is futher beyond me and why they are charging 26 dollars it when its not at all a collector's piece, I can't comprehend. Personally I like the original 1992 version of this cd which is musically a 5 star album. The new Dave Mustaine Remix and Remaster changes too many elements. Altered solos, Drum Machines replace the live Drums, Some Re-Recorded Vocals, He removed some samples and added some samples. Too many changes. I like a classic to be kept a classic.

{"text":"Prime Cuts: Clouds, Oh Cumberland, A Cold, Rainy Morning in London in June\n\nLike a moth to a flame, over the years many artists just flock to record Matraca Berg's compositions.  These singers do come from the whole spectrum of genres including Linda Ronstadt (\"Walk On\"), Reba McEntire (\"The Last One to Know\"), Kenny Chesney and Grace Potter (\"Me and Tequila\"), Sara Evans (\"Fool, I'm a Woman\"), Trisha Yearwood (\"Lying to the Moon\") and Gretchen Wilson (\"I Don't Feel Like Loving You Today\").  A listen to Berg's first record in 13 years \"The Dreaming Fields\" will reveal the reasons why Berg has been such a much demanded scribe.  Her songs unfold like juicy gossips from a women's magazine where she chronicles for us the stories of love, deceit, anguish, pain and the fear of getting old.  Most importantly, Berg does not just sing; she makes us feel the emotions that brim beneath the surfaces of each track.  Berg has a way of helping us feel that these are more than just songs.  Rather, they are life stories coming out of the pages of our lives--some of which are so nebulously painful yet so profoundly articulated that they soothe our pains.  Such is the beauty of this disc.  But Berg is more than just a stellar writer, when she steps up to the microphone she is equally mesmerizing.  Her plaintive tenor in her vocals emphatically draws us effortlessly into each syllable leaving a bittersweet aftertaste that becomes so alluring.\n\nThe tracks that do excel are the ballads, especially the heartbreaking kind.  Thankfully, they exist here in spades.  Check out the lonesome folk ballad \"If I Had Wings,\" a forlorn tale about an abused wife who finally had the courage to fight back.  Despite the song's acoustic framed arrangement it can hardly masked the violent lyrics as Berg sings, \"Mama said call a preacher, I just called the law\/We all knew sooner or later\/It was gonna be me or him...\"  In similar lines is the sultry bluesy \"Your Husband's Cheating on Us\" that also tells of infidelity but this time told from the perspective of the other woman. Berg vocally struts with such attitude that she could easily rival Reba McEntire on how to be a feisty yet classy diva.  Calling to mind her classic ballad \"Lying to the Moon,\" the guitar and fiddled led \"Clouds\" has the same haunting and searing melancholy that just makes heartache feels so good.  \"South of Heaven\" again is another emotional heavyweight as this time Berg is joined by her \"Wine, Women and Song\" road buddies Gretchen Peters and Suzy Bogguss on this anti-war song.  What sets \"South of Heaven\" apart from the copious songs about war is that it is told through the eyes of a terrified mother who cries: \"God you gave your only son, you are not the only one...\"\n\nBerg has resurrected two of her self-penned songs first recorded by her clients before.  The first is the current single \"Oh Cumberland,\" a track that first appeared on Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken Vol. 3.\"  A song Berg wrote for a homesick friend who had just moved to LA, this is just therapeutic stuff for the hurting.  The other cover is \"You and Tequila\" - the current single of Kenny Chesney and Grace Potter--here finds Berg drawing comparisons between the addiction of love and whiskey.  Even darker moments come with \"Silver and Glass\" as Berg explores the inevitable fate of getting old.  Of note also is the ruminative \"A Cold, Rainy Morning in London in June\" a wistful piano piece where the protagonist finds herself comparing to a lonely looking postcard.  Despite the understated backings, the emotions here are stark, penetrating and they really go for the heart.\n\nPerhaps a major quibble about this disc is that it's far too ballad driven.  One certainly misses Berg in her more sassy moments a la on her debut RCA disc where she sings \"I Got It Bad\" and the \"The Things You Left Undone.\"  Also a few tracks become far too indulgent and wordy including the pretty average \"Racing the Angels.\"  Nevertheless, despite these challenges, \"The Dreaming Fields\" is still land worth visiting for its realistic presentation of love and its ensuing tragedies.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"The album notes with this mesmerizing recording are so moving that they derve quoting: ' What do Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, an Indian composer of timeless melodies, a vivaciously virtuosic South African flutist, and over 120 spirited musicians from five continents all have in common? Winds of Samsara, of course.  A truly global effort, this album is the manifest dream of Wouter Kellerman (flautist and composer) and Ricky Kej (keyboards and sythesizer), an unlikely but star-matched collaborative duo. Drawing from disparate cultures, the pair has melted their creative influences into the strange and wonderful sonic gumbo contained within this album. Winds of Samsara speaks to themes of peace and positivity, spinning together forward-moving harmony, progressive composition, and technical prowess with a verve and passion never before attempted in the New Age genre.\n\nWouter Kellerman  channeled his musical and life experiences into collaborations with renowned Indian composer and producer Ricky Kej, often working with his partner digitally, from oceans apart, to sculpt the beautiful musical meditations contained herein. Combining a keen sense of culture-jumping harmony, melody, and pacing, Kej synthesizes cutting-edge music technology and traditional instruments of both Indian and European origins into his work, both within the new age genre and beyond. He currently runs two state-of-the-art studios in Bangalore, the Raveolution Studios, where much of Winds of Samsara was taken from spark of an idea to finished album.\n\nThe tracks are as follows:\n\nMahatma\nNew Earth Calling\nCrystal Moon\nMadiba\nLonging\nHeaven Is Here\nRiver Of Time\nEyes Of Wonder\nRemembrance (Greensleeves)\nJourney To Higher Grounds\nMountain Solitude\nDesert Wind\nGrace\nNocturne\n\nRestore peace in you life.

{"text":"Collective Soul released their ninth studio album See What You Started by Continuing in 2015, after a six-year hiatus between records. The album, to me, was definitely worth the long wait and is now one of my all-time favorites. The albums sound is a cross between their newer sounding stuff from albums like Rabbit and Afterwards, and it is blended with elements from past greats like Collective Soul and Dosage. I am cranking this baby right now and am really enjoying what Im hearing!\n\nThe most noticeable thing about the album, to me, is just how concerted and cohesive it actually sounds. Songs like Contagious and This are so amazingly hooky and infectious, that they tend to get stuck in your head and not leave for days. The albums production value is also top-of-the-line thanks to Ed, while his voice sounds absolutely better and stronger than ever. The album definitely has traces of past glory; however, I feel that it also has a noticeably original feel that sounds both fresh and crisp. Now don't get me wrong, all the woo oooo oooos are still present and infectious, but the album just has an overall focus and concentration that seemed to be lacking in previous Collective Soul albums.\n\nSee What You Started by Continuing is absolutely fantastic and incredibly catchy, and, to me, is a must-have for any fans of Collective Soul. The album will have your feet stomping, hands clapping and head banging all at the same time, but this baby will also have you singing these songs at the top of your lungs. Heres to hoping these guys keep releasing records forwell, ever.","classification":5,"fold":1}

We don't take the time, as Jeanne has done, to actually NOTICE the things that are funny in the world.  Like the absolute greatest masters of the comedic form, Mrs. Robertson doesn't \"make up stuff\" or \"tell jokes\".  She simply lets us take a glimpse at the world at she sees it.  She holds a mirror up to life and finds hilarious that which is looking back.\n\nShe has several funny, FUNNY recordings which you can get as audio or DVD recordings, but \"Southern Style\" is easily in her top 2 or 3 and includes perhaps her most famous story of all: \"Left Brain's Grocery List\" could stand toe to toe with Bill Cosby's \"Noah\" or Richard Pryor's \"Mudbone\" or Andy Griffith's \"What it was, was Football\".\n\nMrs. Robertson's husband is named Jerry, but she calls him \"Left Brain\" and if you don't understand that, as she says, you may be one too...  Jeanne has been drafted into making several of her famous 7-up pound cakes, and needs to dispatch Jerry to the grocery store to pick up a few ingredients.  You'll just have to hear the results, but as the tears roll down your cheeks with laughter the part of your soul that recognizes the truthfulness of things will know there is a little Left Brain in most of us.\n\nThank Heaven for BOTH of the Robertsons and for Jeanne's gift for sharing her magnificently cultivated sense of humor.\n\nA final word: perhaps most miraculously of all, Mrs. Robertson makes you laugh and laugh and laugh with nary an off-color word.

{"text":"Four discs-66,55,53,53 minutes each approximately.  The discs are in individual cardboard holders,which are slipped into an open side of the cardboard box. The booklet lists venues,dates,and who played on the individual tracks.  There is an introduction written by Petty about the making of this box set. The sound (newly mixed),from various venues across 30 years,is uniformly good.  The retro style packaging is perfectly in keeping with Petty's approach to music-when a well made and assembled vinyl album  made a true r&r  statement for an entire (including Petty) generation of listeners.\n\nIn this day and age of over-priced \"deluxe\" releases\/re-releases,even of admittedly great r&r,this collection stands apart.  Not only are all the tracks heard here chosen by Petty,guitarist Mike Campbell,and their producer,the tracks cover 30 years of TOM PETTY AND THE HEARTBREAKERS in concert.  Great music,nice packaging,and a low price make this worth owning.  Petty and his band are one of the few groups still playing music that  matters.  Listen to any track on this collection,and you'll have all the proof you need,no matter if the song is well known,or a live rarity.  Their musical sound and approach have changed little over 30 years.  Their combination of influences of Dylan\/BYRDS,and rootsy garage rock,combined with a bit of the British Invasion sound,have served as the foundation for their sound from the beginning.  And that's what gives their music backbone.  On these tracks the band effortlessly switches across musical styles,from originals to covers,all with that sound they've played from the beginning.\n\nAll the tracks on this set are on an equal footing,from ballads to all out rockers.  Long time listeners of the band will need little proof of the great music here.  If for some reason you aren't to familiar with the band,and want a lot of their greatest songs (\"Breakdown\",\"Refugee\",\"American Girl\",etc.),along with some great covers (THUNDERCLAP NEWMAN's \"Something In The Air\",BOOKER T. AND THE M.G.'S \"Green Onions\",just two examples),with the added electricity of a live performance-this is it.  With hundreds of hours of live material to choose from,distilled down to four discs,a lot of musical ground is covered.  Arguably some listeners will wish a certain song was included (personally I would like to hear more Dylan\/BYRDS covers),but overall,this is an outstanding overview from one of the few long time bands that still matters.\n\nFor anyone who wants to hear music that is important,but more importantly,exciting and visceral,and that guarantees a good time,this is the set to get.  Still,listening to this great music makes you wonder-what more great music is still left on the reels?  But this collection goes a long way in satisfying that craving (like mine) for a generous overview of TOM PETTY AND THE HEARTBREAKERS doing what they do best-performing great r&r in front of an audience.  With that inimitable sound the band has built on all these years,you get the feeling that this band believes in the power and redemption of basic r&r.  This set is even better than the 2 CD set released by Immortal,taken from a concert in 2003,in Chicago.\n\nDo your head a favor and purchase this wonderful collection soon.  And then sit back and listen to some music from one of the few long time bands that can still rock and roll.","classification":4,"fold":1}

This is definitely Dylan at his absolute best in creativity.

There are some songs I can never grow tired of listening to and \"It's Alright Ma\" is one of those.

{"text":"Each one of these tracks on disc two have their own unique, quality that make them essential for Zevon fans BUT a couple are actually superior in their own way to the final versions. For example the plain demo and vocal version of \"The French Inhaler\" packs a wallop as does the solo piano version of \"Mohammed's Radio\". As with the \"Elton John\" two disc release that had demos on the second disc, this is one of those few albums that was great to begin with but has been improved by including these terrific alternate takes and solo demos. The band version of \"Carmelita\" captures the live vibe of how this sounded with a full band and I actually prefer it to the more somber reading on the original album (although both are exceptional). \"Frank and Jesse James\" is SO intimiate you can hear the helicopter that passes over Warren's home briefly at around the 3 minute mark.\n\nWarren Zevon considered this his debut but it was really his second solo album (\"Wanted: Dead or Alive\" was his first an album he really disliked). The cream of L.A. musicians appear on this terrific album. Zevon's vision focuses on the dark side of L.A. and America. \"Hasten Down the Wind\", \"Poor Poor Pitiful Me\" and \"Carmelita\" were all tackled by Linda Ronstandt on various albums and as great as her versions are they lack the bittersweet quality Zevon infuses in his versions. The original album sounds good--not great in this remaster. It's louder, more compressed than the original but fans will really be picking this up for the second disc out outtakes and alternate versions of the songs on disc one.\n\nThe track listing below represents what is on the second disc.\n\n1. Frank And Jesse James(Solo Piano Demo)\n2. The French Inhaler(Solo Piano Demo)\n3. Hasten Down The Wind(Band Demo)\n4. Carmelita(1974 Demo)\n5. Mohammed's Radio(Solo Piano Demo)\n6. Backs Turned Looking Down The Path(Alternate take)\n7. Join Me In L.A.(Alternate take)\n8. Poor Poor Pitiful Me(Alternate take)\n9. Frank And Jesse James(Alternate take)\n10. Mohammed's Radio(Alternate take)\n11. The French Inhaler(Alternate take)\n12. Carmelita(Alternate Version)\n13. Desperados Under The Eaves(alternate take)\n14. Mama Couldn't Be Persuaded(Live)\n15. I'll Sleep When I'm Dead(Alternate Version)\n\nHighly recommended for fans of Zevon. The remaster sounds solid although it doesn't have quite the dynamic range of the original CD. While it is louder the mastering by Gavin Lurssun isn't bad just not ideal.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"\"Fire in the Rainstorm\" is Kori Linae Carothers second project with Will Ackerman producing, and her first solo piano album. It is her fourth album to date and contains twelve original pieces. With one of the more dramatic album covers of the year, the music is both eloquent and beautiful, fueled by grace and passionate emotion. I thoroughly enjoyed Koris first recording with Ackerman, \"Trillium,\" but it is amazing the depth and honesty that is often revealed when an artist goes it alone with just the piano. Such is the case here. It is interesting to note from her bio, that Kori is deaf in one ear and was told as a child that she would never be a musician. She continued her music studies through high school and college, proving the naysayers to be completely wrong. In a way, she has come full circle and is now donating a percentage of the sales from \"Fire in the Rainstorm\" to Hearing Health Foundation.\n\nThe album opens with A Day Like No Other, a dreamy and slightly melancholy piece that also expresses determination and hope - a lovely way to begin. Flowing and lyrical, it grabbed my attention right away! Nunus Sunrise was composed as a loving tribute with warmth and strong emotions. Its really interesting how the piece starts to slow near the end and then just fades out, unresolved - kind of like life does sometimes. Meadow is a favorite with its relaxed, carefree mood and easy grace. Tidal Rift is a beautiful, heartfelt piece inspired by the ups and downs in relationships - another favorite. The title track is a passionate piece written for a friend whose life has been full of turbulence. The piece begins calmly, gradually building in intensity and drama - very powerful! The Day is a tribute to those who lost their lives on 9\/11. Originally recorded as an electronic piece on Koris first album, \"The Road Less Traveled,\" its a poignant and tender piano solo - another favorite. The Kindly Beast is especially touching, knowing that Marvin, Koris beloved dog, died recently. He followed her everywhere and liked to get in the way of her hands when she was playing the piano (Ive had the same problem with my cats!). Marvins playful antics will live forever in this song. Whispers of the Heart is a stirring tribute to friends and family who stand by through lifes trials and joys. Buoyant yet deeply emotional, its a beauty! When the Trees Fell mourns the loss of a giant tree with five trunks that was taken down by a huge storm. Grief and loss flow throughout this gorgeous piece, ending the album with a sigh and a tear.\n\nKori Linae Carothers has really come into her own with \"Fire in the Rainstorm.\" I hope it brings her the fans and recognition she so deserves! Very highly recommended!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"A member of one of the most famous families from Bohemia, Franz Benda (1709-1789) entered into the service of Frederick the Great in 1732. As a violin master, he played some 50,000 performances over a forty year period. He also wrote a lot of violin music, 110 solo capriccios, at least 150 sonatas, 31 duets and some 28 concertos, including this one in D Major.\n\nWith a crisply articulated intro, the Allegro ma non molto features a harpsichord continuo and string dominated orchestral support. As a transitional work from the Baroque, it contains more interplay between the single violin and the symphonic tutti than was the norm for the prevalent Italian style. Smoothly flowing, Bendas writing for the solo string is virtuosic without being showy, letting the melodic lines develop naturally. In the minor keyed Largo, the sweep of the orchestral accompaniment lends a somber weight to the throbbing vibrato of Gabriela Demeterova. With a dramatic pathos in the uppermost register, she brings a sorrowful sweetness in her tone that must be similar to the reported quality that set apart Bendas adagio playing. Horns appear for the brisk finale, a bright Allegro with bravura fiddling as the single violin drifts high on the E string.\n\nA generation or two later, Bohemian born Vaclav Pichl (1741-1805) studied philosophy and theology in Prague before accepting a musical directorship in Milan. After 21 years, he returned to Vienna and died while playing a violin concerto at the Lobkowitz Palace.\nHis D Major Concerto Op. 3, No. 1 opens with a marching Allegro sostenuto, clipped and precise. While still employing the harpsichord as continuo, the writing finds even greater collaboration between the soloist and orchestra, engaging in extensive rhythmic interactions and trading melodic ideas, including one haunting echo in minor. A higher degree of technical proficiency of the single violin is also required.\n\nA minor keyed charmer, the following Adagio finds striking support in the lower strings with a lovely countermelody while the ethereal vibrato of the solo sounds so much like the beating of angel wings. Ending the 2nd movement on an open cadence sets up a smooth transition as the resolution occurs in the sweetly pure tones from the violin, the very first notes of the concluding Rondo. Interrupting the relentless drive in the lower strings, a brief passage in minor offers a dark interlude in an otherwise cheery finale.\n\nBy another Bohemian, the final concerto represents the culmination of the Viennese High Classical style. Renowned as a teacher and violin virtuoso, Antonin Vranicky (1761-1820) composed some outstanding chamber music and challenging concertos, one of which is the C Major included on this recording.\n\nUsing tympani and winds to create a broader palette of orchestral colors, the work begins with a bold Allegro giusto. Amid a longer, more extensive development section, the soloist shines in the fiendishly difficult passage work while in the reverential Adagio that follows, the writing stretches the upper reaches of the instruments register. After a chorale like start, the weeping violin carries the movement until gentle horns lead to a serene close. Marked Alla Pollacca- Allegretto, the finale is a frisky Polish folk dance. With an appealing stutter step in the rhythm, this 3rd movement features a brief mournful interlude, dazzling flourishes from the violin and a rousing finish.\n\nThe original recording from 1995 from Supraphon is fine, placing the solo violin close enough for the intimate slower sections to be sharp and clear. Under the able artistic direction of Milan Lajcik, the Prague Chamber Orchestra brings an accomplished reading to their fellow countrymens concertos. But the spotlight rightfully belongs to the exquisite work of Gabriela Demeterova. This fine traversal of the development of the Viennese violin concerto is testimony to her artistry.\n\nPlease note that the 2008 edition includes a video bonus track of the bold Allegro giusto from Vranickys concerto in C Major.","classification":5,"fold":1}

All the songs are strong and mesh well, the production is very good (only a few parts that sound a bit mushy or top level cut off).  I feel compelled though to talk more about the virtual reality deluxe package.  Once you go online to see how to assemble the glasses, just down load the ceekvr app, set up an account, and off you go.  You place your phone in the goggles (which my samsung s5 barely fit, kept bumping volume and power button if not exactly in spot), but once set up, easy to use.  Your phone becomes a 3d room that you can turn in and point the orange pointer at a video and it plays.  The videos consist of an interview and 5 songs that you can see all angles  including ceiling and floors.  I had no issues following the directions, in the vr world when you look at the floor there are a pause and return to home room.

Johnny's falsetto voice starting out in the song actually sounded better than the deep, gruff sound he normally has, you know, that mature sound that New Edition chose him for.  It's almost like two different people were singing.  The beat is smooth and the background vocals along with the hook make this song a hit.  If he had just gone with the falsetto for the entire song, I would have given this 5 stars.  But good job overall.","classification":4,"fold":1}

Musically, she has also wasted her spirit as well in her songs. Her latest song, Diamonds feels very choppy and her voice sounds a bit too course. I really did not find the song to deliver, as some of her earlier songs had. I really didn't find it to drive into the soul of the voice. I definitely think Rihanna needs to take more time into her songs, and not rush into making album after album, year after year. It really has put a strain on her talent.

{"text":"Before the Slim Shady LP, a no-name emcee named Eminem was probably ripping the mic at the Lyricist Lounge or other underground hiphop spots...back when he was an ill lyricist hungry for attention by scaring you sh**less with raw punchlines and excellent verbal battling ability.

To a hiphop standpoint, by focusing on his lyrics and comparing with his earlier efforts, this CD is the beginning of his downfall...  But with the variety of ideas it saves the CD.  And by being so creative brings it up to 5 stars...\nUnfortunately, because he's not on a dependable label he's forced to rap to garbage beats (which is Dre's specialty, but this release are some of his better ones), he's forced to do exactly what the higher level employees he works with say.  He's not able to make his own decisions and the contoversy that has become of him has forced him to listen to Dre and others and rap about that instead of making his own ideas...

He seems to lack the knack for building and sustaining underlying tension in these works, attributes that are hallmarks of recordings by Karajan, Maazel, Ormandy and others.

{"text":"\"You'll see perpetual change...\"\n\nIn 2008, Yes vocalist Jon Anderson found himself ill and unable to tour for quite some time. The remaining band members decided to continue onward, hiring Yes tribute singer (with some prog cred in Canadian band Mystery) Benoit David. Able to capture Anderson's high-vocaled tenor quite well in concert, things went as well as could be hoped for as Yes toured for the next few years. Rick Wakeman had also departed again during this period (for the, um, 5th time), and his son Oliver took over on keyboards.\n\nYes has always been, from the very first departure of Peter Banks in 1970, a revolving door of players. We all have our favorite albums and lineups, but what always baffled me was seeing\/hearing comments by various fans who\ncannot seem to ever accept what is right in front of them, here and now.\n\nMaybe I am just less biased, having discovered Yes as recently as 1998, and I wasn't overexposed towards one particular band member or sound. My first Yes albums that I purchased that summer covered the span from the late 60s to the 90s, so I became a pluralist early on.\n\nOne of my early favorites was Drama. I paid $ 1.99 for an old beat up cassette of it at a used record store, and I'll never forget the first time I heard \"Into The Lens\" as I played it in the car. There was so much darkness, sadness, and emotion in the song. At the time, I had no idea who was singing or playing...to me it was just amazing prog music, and I accepted it at face value.\n\nI quickly formed an emotional connection to Drama, and while I also loved 90125, Close To The Edge, Talk, and countless other albums, I never understood the absolute rancor and negativity towards it. Especially coming as it does after Tormato (which has far fewer good songs, and perhaps Wakeman's ugliest keyboard tones, and Jon Anderson's weakest singing and lyrics up to that point), I couldn't see how anyone could comparitively dislike it.\n\nEverytime I saw Yes tour, I hoped and prayed, but they never played anything from the album (aside from maybe a quick snippet of \"Tempus Fugit\" during the \"Whitefish\" solo.) I never had the chance to ask Jon Anderson about it, but whenever I would bring it up at band signings to Alan White or Chris Squire, I would get an embarassed grin and some half-mumbled comment. It was like a kid asking for a toy, and a parent saying \"someday\", which really was a subtext for \"never.\"\n\nAs luck would have it, not only would Yes start performing Drama material again on recent post-Anderson tours (\"Machine Messiah\" and \"Tempus Fugit\"), but Oliver Wakeman was unceremoniously dropped, and Geoff Downes -- my favorite keyboard player, Buggle extraordinaire, and Asia flame-keeper -- would rejoin the band for the first time in 30 years.\n\nWith Drama-era singer Trevor Horn producing (himself famously responsible for producing 90125 and Big Generator in the 80s, which kickstarted Yes into a whole new fanbase), Fly From Here suddenly sounded very exciting...\n\nRegarding the split of Anderson and Wakeman...I will always enjoy their music, and their hugely important contributions to Yes. But they alone are not Yes. And quite frankly, much of their solo work bores me. I wish them the best, and I am excited about their project with Trevor Rabin for 2012, but I am objectively critical of their supposedly god-like status in Yes.\n\nWakeman hasn't had a single tasteful keyboard patch since 1972 (his playing is unvarnished thankfully), and Anderson's singing and lyrics (despite many exceptions along the way), hasn't done much for me in almost as long.\n\nNow, onto the music...\n\n\"Fly From Here\" is the album's 20+ minute title track, broken down into smaller sections. Beginning softly (and with a piano motif that almost brings to mind \"White Car\"), we launch into \"Overture\". Perhaps the highlight of the album for me, this is Yes at their epic best, firing on all cylinders. Piano is mixed with sighing 80s-style synth, and reverbed triggered drum effects create a forward movement as Chris Squire's chunky, thumping bass keeps a steady pulse. Right away it is clear that Trevor Horn's production has treated us to the best-sounding Yes album in quite some years, as far as clarity and space between instruments and vocals.\n\nThis intro smoothly transitions into \"We Can Fly\". Written in 1980 by Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes just prior to the Drama sessions, it was demoed and played live on the subsequent tour. Heard for many years on various bootleg recordings (and finally given an official release in 2005 on the boxed set The Word Is Live), it was introduced onstage as being \"on the followup to Drama\", which was ostensibly planned for 1981. This Yes lineup dissapated, however, and interestingly enough...30 years later...things have come full circle, and you could very well describe Fly From Here as that followup album, seeing as how it has 4\/5ths of the Drama lineup, and with Trevor Horn as a primary influence in the writing and recording.\n\n\"We Can Fly\" has beautiful keyboard and piano melodies, and the harmony vocals are gorgeous. New vocalist Benoit David asserts himself wonderfully, somewhat surprisingly sounding less like Jon Anderson and a bit more like Trevor Horn (more Parallels!)\n\n\"Sad Night at the Airfield\" (previously heard as a shorter demo by The Buggles) begins with some somber acoustic guitar by Steve Howe. It explodes with melody as the line \"...Of air, that clouds in the night as we breathe.\" This is one of the most gorgeous moments on the album, as the old Drama elements resurface again (Squire's bass, and Downes' old Fairlight keyboard.)  This section is the highlight of the album for me, as the next verse brings everything a step higher, Howe joins in on pedal steel, and the vocals and keyboards reach a crescendo of esquisite beauty.\n\nThis is one of those stamped and trademarked \"Yes moments\", akin to the musical peaks found in \"And You And I\", \"The Revealing Science of God\", \"Endless Dream\", or \"Awaken.\"\n\nWe return to the original piano motif as we explode into \"Madman at the Screens\", which is basically the \"Overture\" extended with more instrumentation and lyrics. The music is joyful, bouncy, and dramatic, as it moves between the dynamics of darkness and beauty. The overall structure is very pop-oriented, and the little xylophone-type keyboard tones unconciously make me recall the best moments of ABBA. Near the end of the song, some classic Hammond organ joins in. And is that a Taurus bass pedal I hear?\n\n\"Bumpy Ride\" comes next, perhaps the most \"oddball\" moment in the suite. This has a strong Howe influence in the bouncy, quirky playing and guitar tone, and subtly reminds me of something that might have been heard on his\nfirst two solo albums. A fun mostly instrumental segment, it again moves from light to shade and back again. I'm very much also reminded of a sound that could have come from the Tormato album.\n\nWith a sudden changeover (almost too unexpected and odd, IMO) \"We Can Fly - Reprise\" ends the song suite as it began. Although not the most climactic ending on a Yes epic, it gets the job done.\n\n\"The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be\" is a good mid-tempo ballad, which grows on me more with each listen. Chris Squire handles the lead on this, and his vocals have always been underrated in the Yes recipe, as far as I'm concerned. This song is reminiscent of material on his 1975 solo album Fish Out Of Water, again recalling the past...\n\n\"Life On A Film Set\" is classic symphonic prog. The beginning of the song is highly similiar to any number of acoustic ballads to be found on the early albums by Yes, King Crimson, or ELP. The production and sound gets\nmore dense as it moves forward, moving from moody balladry to bouncy and joyful moments. When I sit back and objectively pay attention to all of the song elements, it really captures the Yes that I know and love so\nwell. A bouncy, fun, beautifully-layered song as only they could do it.\n\n\"Hour of Need\" is classic Steve Howe again, featuring his Porteguese guitar, which brings back memories of \"I've Seen All Good People\", \"Wonderous Stories\", \"Sketches In The Sun\", and \"Nine Voices.\" The harmony vocals are (again) gorgeous, and the moog keyboards join in tastefully here and there. This is Classic Yes, in the wonderful tradition of Fragile and Going For The One.\n\n\"Solitaire\" is an acoustic guitar piece, this time featuring Steve by himself. Howe's solo moments are always tasteful, refined, quirky, and reflective, and this one is no exception. This is very much in the same\nouvre as \"Mood For A Day\" and \"Masquerade.\"\n\n\"Into The Storm\" features songwriting contributions from all band members, and again with the bubbly bass guitar, piano, harmonies, and keyboards, sounds like something from the 1977-80 period. An upbeat, positive ending to the album.\n\nAs far as individual contributions, I would say that Squire's bass-playing and singing is top-notch as it has been for ages, Steve Howe sounds very refined, fiery and confidant (see what health food and meditation can do for you, kids?), and Geoff Downes does a good simple job of bringing in his poppy, quirky Buggles keyboards, while still retaining the classic Yes motifs of mini-moog, Hammond, and mellotron. Only Alan White (on drums) sounds a little subdued, but he has a few interesting textural shuffles and grooves.\n\nOverall, I think it is fair to say that Fly From Here is the (overall) best Yes album since 90125, and slightly edges out ahead of The Ladder, which (especially in retrospect) was quite amazing itself. It certainly sounds like the followup to Drama (in some parallel universe 1981.) Let's call it Drama 2.0.\n\n\"One word can bring you 'round...changes.\"\n\nYes will always be different things to different people. Its overall dynamic is sort of like a diamond...there are a lot of rough edges and dark spots, but turn it around slightly and you will see joyful, crystalline moments as well. To me, it's always been about the message of positivity, relationships, love, and change. Being truly progressive; trying new things, new approaches, new styles. Mixing some Indian raga with some country music. Some techno-pop with some arena rock. Some church choirs with some classical granduer.\n\nI am just extremely tired of how the band and their legacy have carried onward through the years. The group spent so many years chasing hit singles after the success of \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", and became blinded by management, technology, and money. Relations broke down, factions formed, and no one seemed to know how to capture the original band spirit of five guys sitting in a living room or barn, and just brainstorming and writing some music together on a set of drums, piano and acoustic guitar. Yes unconciously stopped believing in themselves, and the fans followed suit. When in doubt, keep it simple. And just do it.\n\nFly From Here is a fantastic album, and a great reminder of sounds and places that remind you of a distant past, while still looking over that distant horizon. Remember...We can fly...","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"It took awhile for Jaheim's 1st video to grow on me.  I would see \"Could It Be\" quite often on BET and finally after awhile the track began to grow on me.  Eventually, I picked up Jaheim's 1st CD entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ghetto-Love\/dp\/B00005899K\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ghetto Love<\/a>.  My favorite tracks included \"Looking For Love\", \"Ghetto Love\", \"Just In Case\", \"Anything\" w\/Next and \"Ready Willing & Able\".  His debut was definitely strong despite there being some filler amongst the 21 tracks.  His 2nd CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Still-Ghetto\/dp\/B00006WKYJ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Still Ghetto<\/a>&nbsp;got a tremendous push because of the 1st single \"Fabolous\" that was an anthem dedicated to the young kids that are growing up in this crazy world.  My favorite tracks ended up being \"Diamond In Da Ruff\", \"Let's Talk About It\", \"Beauty & Thug\" w\/Mary J. Blige, \"Long As I Live\" and \"Me & My B____\".  In 2006 Jaheim released his 3rd disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ghetto-Classics\/dp\/B000BJ7CCY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ghetto Classics<\/a>.  The 1st single was \"Everytime I Think About Her\" w\/Jadakiss and my other favorites included \"The Chosen One\", \"Like A DJ\", \"Masterpiece\", \"Conversation\" and \"Come Over\".\n\nJust as review \"Musac Critic\" stated, Jaheim's 4th release, \"The Makings Of A Man\" has Jaheim playing it safe for the most part.  The 1st track \"Voice Of R&B\" is an introduction to r&b listeners who may not be too familiar with Jaheim's work outside of the singles that everyone has heard.  The track clocks in at less than 3 minutes and is a short but sweet track for Jaheim fans.  \"Hush\" is produced by R Kelly and has Jaheim describing a situation where he unintentionally started messin' around with a female that he knew was with a guy that he knew.  Jaheim blames it on having a couple of drinks but now that the 1st time was so good, he is trying to figure out how they can keep things going without the guy finding out.  \"Have You Ever\" is right along the lines of \"Fabolous\" as Jaheim is reminiscing to events that happened in the past when he was younger.  You hear the familiar Kaygee sound that you heard on \"Ghetto Love\" as well.  \"Lonely\" has Jaheim employing his own concept to the Bobby Womack classic \"If You Think You're Lonely Now\".  The chrous stays the same but Jaheim adds his own lyrics to the verses and the other parts of the song.  This is definitely one of my favorite tracks on this CD.  \"Life Of A Thug\" will be one of those songs that if you heard Jaheim's 1st 3 CDs that you have heard before.  However, you will still want to listen to the track in its entirety.  He talks about how his dad passed when he was 2 so all that he knew were the streets growing up despite having the guidance of his mom.  My personal favorite track on \"The Makings Of A Man\" is \"Just Don't Have A Clue\".  Babyface shows up to produce a nice midtempo jam using acoustic guitars and various other elements.  Jaheim is trying to tell the lady that he is with that she has no idea about the plans that he has for her in the future as long as she realzies that he should be the one and only one for her.  He states that he is better than the guys that she is use to so she shouldn't be afraid to give her all in the relationship.  \"She Ain't You\" has Jaheim talking about a woman that isn't girlfriend that treats him better than his actual girlfriend does.  He even says that the particular girl's love is like a Bentley Coup and his girlfriend's love is like a Mercedes Benz that's been used.  OUCH!..lol  \"She Ain't You\" is another nice midtempo jam.  \"Never\" is the lead single and serves that purpose well.  Jaheim talks about resisting the temptation of love before because he didn't want to turn in his player card.  However, after meeting this particular woman, that he is ready to burn the infamous black book.  Keyshia Cole, who is 3 singles into her sophomore disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Just-Like-You\/dp\/B000VDDCHO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Just Like You<\/a>, joins Jaheim on \"I've Changed\".  Kaygee employs a nice sample in Atlantic Starr's \"Let's Get Closer\" and creates a nice uptempo jam for the prince and princess of \"ghetto love r&b.\"  If you are a fan of either artist then this just might be your favorite track on this CD.  \"What You Think Of That\" is another one of my favorites as Jaheim talks about how his \"Diamond In Da Ruff\" is making him feel.  He's not really caring about what the world thinks about the relationship and he is happy to have her in his life.  \"Make A Wish\" is a midtempo jam that has Jaheim wanting to treat his woman to a nice time since it's her birthday and \"Back Together Again\" is a nice song that talks about how his dad and mom are together again in heaven since they both left the Earth to soon.\n\nIf your purchased \"The Makings Of A Man\" at Circuit City then you were blessed with 2 bonus tracks in \"Roster\" and \"Keep It 100\".  \"Roster\" is the better track as the Kaygee produced track will remind you of \"Just In Case\" from \"Ghetto Love\" and \"Like A DJ\" from \"Ghetto Classics\".  \"Keep It 100\" isn't a bad track, but you will clearly be able to tell why it was a bonus track.\n\nOverall, if this is your 1st introduction to a Jaheim CD, I wouldn't expect you to be a big fan of this CD.  However, if you have followed Jaheim since \"Ghetto Love\" then you will enjoy Volume 4 of Jaheim's ghetto classic series.  He has a nice voice and you already know the type of songs that you are going to get from Jaheim so you shouldn't be surprised by the material.  If you liked \"Ghetto Love\", \"Still Ghetto\" and \"Ghetto Classics\", then you should also own \"The Makings Of A Man\".\n\nJames' Top 5\n\n1) Just Don't Have A Clue\n2) What You Think Of That\n3) Lonely\n4) I've Changed w\/Keyshia Cole\n5) She Ain't You\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\nHush\nNever\nLife Of A Thug\nRoster (Bonus Track)\nMake A Wish","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Initially, I was turned off by her whiny high-pitched voice in the first lines of the song.  Every time those opening lines came on the radio, I totally rolled my eyes because it sounded like Ke$ha was sneering at me with an obnoxious party attitude.  But since my local radio station played it a million times a day, I got used to her voice and talking\/singing style and eventually got past the annoyance.  The rest of the song is actually a decent dance pop song.  Auto-Tune is very noticeably used.  Naturally like many other dance pop songs, it's about partying and clubbing.  The name dropping of Mick Jagger stood out in an odd way though but that's minor.  The vibe of this song is more like dirty hard partying, and the video totally reflects that.  I've grown to like this song, but it's not my favorite that's being played on the radio these days.","classification":4,"fold":1}

I am no expert, but I have owned a modest library of classical over the years, so I have a lot of listening experience.  I've always wanted my collection to be more complete, but classical is just one genre of music I love so the expenditures get spread around.  It was thrilling to buy these sets, and I've been listening almost non-stop and still have much to discover.\n\nThis Haydn disc is great, and while one reviewer criticized it mildly for having too many chorale selections, I must say that they aren't my favorite, either.  However, I have found that there are a few that I liked at first listen.  I'd never have heard them at all if it were not for the great price and the preponderance of non-vocal music.  The Haydn strikes me as being right up there with the Bach set(s) in quality and selection.  I love Amazon and the various labels involved who make these glorious and ridiculously affordable offerings available.  Bravo!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"After their multi-platinum smash 'Back in Black', AC\/DC was under the gun to create a follow-up. Mutt Lange had been tough to work with but he seemed to have the Midas touch with producing a chart-topping album. Back into the Studio they went. What resulted was louder than bombs. Fans snatched this new album up as fast as they could. The first 'side' was outstanding but the second side...Well, ok. It was no Back in Black, that's for sure.  So what happened? It was a big seller, but it just wasn't as awesome as 'Highway to Hell' . When Brian was asked about it during his Behind the Music interview he simply said, \"We had this monster worldwide hit, 'Back in Black' and then...trying to make the next one just as amazing? I just don't think it can be done.\"  The title track is The big finish to their live shows, even today.\nComplete with real working cannons (firing blanks of course) which they bring on stage with them. It's a much smaller version of the firepower they used to haul onstage back in '81\/82. During that tour, legend has it that they fired off their '21gun Salute' and it was so freaking loud it shattered windows in one East Coast city. Another legend from the UK was during the pretentious Wimbledon Tennis Match, they set off the cannons at the end of their 'Monsters of Rock' show.","classification":4,"fold":1}

I like Glen Campbell's version better, except it was live, and there is a long, long guitar solo in the middle that is just terrible.  It works in a live performance, but not as a studio recording.

{"text":"\"Produced, Arranged, Composed, and Performed by Prince\". This is what every album this guy released from 1978 onwards stated, indicative of his incredible talent. What a sad day April 21 was, especially for all of us, '80s kids. One of the most gifted artists in music history passed away, gone like a purple star disappearing into the deep Minneapolis night. To anyone of my generation, Prince was not just an iconic artist, but also a tremendous inspiration, having had a major effect on the shape of the contemporary music industry, not just because of his music but, also, with the way he treated and valued his recordings. 39 recording years, 39 studio albums, 5 soundtrack albums, 4 live albums, 12 EPs, 104 singles. And with over 100 million records sold worldwide, Prince has been ranked as one of the most prolific, successful, and influential acts of all time. I am happy that this final release somewhat compensates for the mostly mediocre output he released over the last decade.\n\nInitially released exclusively on Tidal for streaming and purchase, the new album is a continuation of \"HitnRun Phase One\", but an improvement on that record's inconsistency. Pulled together over 4 years, it is equally eclectic and formulaic, but more organic and warmer than its predecessor, with nearly half of the 12 songs showcasing Prince's trademark audacious funk and lush R'n'B balladry. \"HnRPT\" reunites him with backing band The New Power Generation, contributing much to the final result, reminiscent of his early '90s albums, like \"Diamonds and pearls\" and \"Love symbol\" (incidentally my 2 favourite Prince albums). Tracks like the sexually charged \"Xtraloveable\", the accordion-tinged ballad \"When she comes\", the poppy \"Groovy potential\", and the epic, 7-minute \"Black muse\", are obvious standouts, though only a couple of tracks on here are poor. Overall, it is definitely in the good side in his discography, and a good point to reconnect with him.\n\nAs much as I am devastated by his loss, I am more than grateful for his work. And so, I would like to take this opportunity to urge everyone to purchase some of this man's music. Most would mention \"Purple rain\" and \"Sign 'o' the times\" as his greatest works. Since I was a baby back then, if I were to make a recommendation, it would have to be his 1991 \"Diamonds and pearls\", and 1992 \"Love symbol\" albums, 2 of my most loved albums by him, or by any other artists from that decade, fine examples of music that moves both body and soul. This is the kind of music Prince did. Also, to those who prefer greatest-hits albums, \"The its\/The B-Sides\" (1993) is the most comprehensive collection of his work, featuring no less than 56 tracks, representing his golden era of the '80s and early '90s, an essential and unmissable listening experience of The Artist Formerly Known As Prince, and subsequently called by an unpronounceable symbol chosen as his stage name.\n\nPrince's father said that he named his son Prince because he wanted him to do everything he wanted to do. He certainly did most than many. What he did best of all, was to demonstrate the brilliance of his Purple Highness in such a way in order to be respected for his musicianship. That immeasurable talent of this pint-sized pop giant, whose musical genius extended beyond his eccentricities, was and will always be, adamant proof that he was ahead of anyone in pop culture. Prince Rogers Nelson, \"Nothing compares 2 U\". You will be missed. You are now reunited with 3 of your '80s - and of equal to your own calibre - counterparts: Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, and David Bowie.

{"text":"The year was 1996. Dr. Dre had managed to disentangle himself from the talons of Suge Knight and Death Row Records. Dre had started his own label, Aftermath, and was ready to sit back, renounce his gangsta image and watch the money roll in. While Death Row was reeling from the death of 2Pac and the disappointing sales of Snoop's Doggfather album, Dre was poised to start a new rap empire.\nSo out he came with this Aftermath sampler compilation, and we didn't hear from him again for three years. The reason? The album more or less ... and Dre's midas production touch was missing on most of the four or five songs he actually had a hand in.\nIt's a shame, too, because the one Dre track on the album, \"Been There, Done That,\" is really good. The production is smooth and silky, with distinctive percussion and a lazy bass line, and Dre sounds more confident and comfortable than ever as he brags about his earthly possessions. (\"I've got a palace in the hills overlooking the sea \/ It's worth eight, but I only paid 5.3.\") An entire post-gangsta Dre album in this vein would have sold through the roof, but alas, he hadn't the creative energy for it.\nThe other album highlights can be summed up in a couple paragraphs. KRS-One, Nas and B-Real of Cypress Hill perform under the name Group Therapy with \"East Coast \/ West Coast Killas,\" a Dre-produced track that picks up where \"Natural Born Killas\" left off. The vocal trade-offs are seamless, the bass is solid and the whistling Dre synth is bad@ss as ever.\nMel-Man, who co-produced Dr. Dre 2001, gets his solo track in \"Sh**tin' on the World,\" which overcomes its rather non-descript Dre beat with humor, intentional and otherwise. (Mel's liner notes read, \"I grew up with roaches y'am saying straight reppin' the projects to the fullest!\")\nThe aborted R+B girl group Hands-On turns in the piano-heavy, sultry groove \"Got Me Open\" with a Dre rap reminiscent of the same era's \"No Diggity.\" And RC (the only artist on the album with two songs) turns in a decent, funky remake of David Bowie's \"Fame.\"\nOtherwise, the album is indistinct, passed down to Dre production apprentices like Bud'da, Floyd Howard, Flossy P and Maurice Wilcher. There's a reason acts like Miscellaneous, King T, Nowl and Sharief never took off. As an intro record-label sampler, you have to wonder if Dre planned to produce or oversee albums from all these acts or if he was just looking to put together a half-@ssed compilation and laugh all the way to the bank while Death Row went under. Either way, it was a mistake.","classification":2,"fold":1}

I don't mind a bit of yelling in a song when it feels right, but personally I prefer if it's reserved for only key parts of the song rather than every point at which there are lyrics.

{"text":"There is no denying that Megadeth  Mustaine and the brand  remain a force to be reckoned with in the metal community, especially for those of us that have spent nearly 3 decades following their career and lapping up every ounce of metal forged. But along with all of the glory has come the frustration with stylistic changes and more significantly  the dreaded line-up changes. The 2014 departure of drummer Shawn Drover and guitarist Chris Broderick  who were excellent at their trade and went on to form Act of Defiance  was the latest disruption that threatened to put the proverbial nail in the coffin to Mustaines Megadeth machine and all this over fans ranting over wanting a reformation with Menza and Friedman. Seriously? Having seen both Drover and Broderick on the Rust In Peace anniversary tour a few years ago, these guys gelled with Ellefson and Mustaine and more than carried their weight in metal. But Mustaine has never been one to give up easily in the face of adversity and it seems there has always been a bevy of talented musicians ready to answer the call to serve in the Megadeth army. Enter Kiko Loureio (Angra) and Chris Adler (Lamb of God). These guys were more than willing to bring their own enthusiastic and talented skills to the aid of the venerable, yet resilient Mustaine. Following in the trend of current dystopian movies\/themes whilst still treading in the familiar waters of Megadeth political and sociological commentary, Dystopia not only delivers a blistering performance by the new band but it also hearkens back to the early years where thrash ruled the day  this one feels a lot like the Rust In Peace era, but there is more as well.\n\nIts rare that I listen to pre-release material because I find that it often taints the pure virgin listening experience of a new record. But with all of the hype about the return to thrash\/guitar-driven metal, I could not resist the temptation to sample Dystopia, Fatal Illusion and the brilliant The Threat Is Real. The catchy riffs are there, the shred is there, and Adler more than supports the Megadeth drumming legacy. Plus, Ellefson really delivers on this record  some tasty leads on his part (Fatal Illusion for example) and more than just a supporting role this time around. The scathing (and semi-prophetic) lyrics continue (Lying in State) but this time the riffs, speed and intensity are there to back them up. While there is nothing new - this stuff reeks of Peace Sells meets Rust In Peace  Megadeth sounds vital and rejuvenated which to me is more than just fine. I found Super Collider to be a bit tedious with the experimentation, differing styles, sound-bites and such and just a bit too much like Youthanasia in that regard. The songs are shorter  but they hit hard and fast. Hints of Countdown show up here on Post American World  a song that has the Symphony of Destruction riff\/vibe  and there are a few mellower elements here as well. Poisonous Shadows is the longest and most progressive song  and certainly one of the most thought provoking  and features some classical moments and a piano epilogue which segues nicely into the expressive and neoclassical instrumental Conquer or Die. The cover of Fears Foreign Policy concludes 45 minutes of pace, push and peace?  definitely a metal album folks  for metal folks.\n\nIn addition to the CD and mp3 versions, there is a red vinyl version - which I cant wait to explore - and the amazing Terminator meets Megadeth cover artwork lithograph (signed by Mustaine).  Not only is Dystopia a Megadeth call to arms and a return to form, it is a bold declaration of metal defiance in an era of computer driven drivel  the threat is real indeed!!","classification":5,"fold":1}

I've heard that they're an obnoxious, repetitive band, that they've supposedly \"sold out\" artistically, and lead vocalist Chad Kroeger apparently gets flak for dating\/marrying Avril Lavigne (what, celebrities aren't allowed to marry each other?).  I couldn't judge myself, as I hadn't listened to their music, so when I discovered that one of my favorite songs (on a mix CD given to me by a friend) happened to be a Nickelback song, I was a little surprised.  This song was by the much-hated band?  If this was an example of their usual work, why all the hatred?\n\nI don't know if \"Hero\" is typical of all Nickelback's work or not, but it's a powerful song that gets me in the gut whenever I hear it.\n\n\"Hero\" is a rock number that first appeared on the \"Spiderman\" soundtrack, which is befitting.  It's a strong song about the difficulties of being a hero, and being strong in the face of adversity.  It's accompanied by a powerful guitar section, with my only nitpick being that the drum section can sometimes overpower the other instruments.  And it does have a soft, melancholy acoustic interlude that gives the listener a slight break from the heavier guitars.\n\nIf this is an example of all Nickelback's work, then I'm going to give the rest of the band's discography a shot.  If it's not their typical work... well, then at least there's one Nickelback song I really like.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I'm writing this review on the original Vinyl version of this album released by Columbia Records (CL 657) in 1955. The songs,music and sound are all excellent.\n In a collection such as this there are great variations. The songs are almost impossible to pin down as to dates,and there are instances where one set of lyrics may have several melodies,or where a melody may have any number of different lyrics.\"Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie\",for example,is one of these. The basics has been traced to South Dakota in the early 1900's,but the song spread from there throughout the west.,and had many tunes and lyrics. \"The Old Chisolm Trail\" has many variations. This was the trail that extended from Texas to Kansas,where cowboys drove the herds of cattle to market. These hard of the trail working cowboys all knew there were wild times in the end that made up for the drudgery they went through on the trail. The beautiful \"Streets of Larado\",also known as \"The Cowboy's Lament\" was sung throughout the American and Canadian west. It is believed this song is of Irish origin,and has many different tunes and lyrics.\n The song \"Home on the Range \" is one of the best kpown and loved songs of the west.\n All the songs included make this one of the best collections one can find that represent the best songs that were so much of the west,and even after the days when they were sung at campsites along the trail;they became an intregal part of all western movies.\n For a list of all the songs check out  and even sample the MP3 version. There are several Reviewers who feel the re mastered versions are not as good as they hoped for. My original vinyl album has a cover showing cowboys alongside the herd. There are two very similar photographs shown here.with a cowboy in the forground. One has the rider facing the herd,in mine that same rider is facing leftward..

In fact, with most artists they have lagged at the talents of the heart over and over again. But for Ed Sheeran, he has really made some great songs overall since he did come out 5 years ago. Songs like The A-Team and Leg House have really given him a lovely imprint. But, when I had first heard the singles Don't and Sing from his X record, I would honestly have to say I found them to be more mixed blessings than someone who could ride into the rankings of artists like James Taylor and Willie Nelson. But his fourth single from the album X Photograph, is one of those songs that really takes him back to the core at his music from the simplicity at the soul. I honestly think that this is best single from the album, above Thinking Out Loud and his other songs. The song is definitely very intimate from Ed, and something I sincerely recommend you download for your music library.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Cross Paul Simons Graceleand with Little Big Town vocal layers, and add occasional wallops of percussion, along with an occasional ukelele . . . this is one tough album to pigeonhole.

This aptly-named band will get you on your feet, leaping airspace, and smiling yourself silly.  Infectious doesnt begin to describe how these five musicians catch your ear and don't let go.  Every song is a winner.  The confident swagger of Rule the World sets the positive tone carried through to the end of the album.  Boomerang, Heart Is a Weapon, and Home Well Go (Take My Hand) are the energy centers, but none hold a candle to Ill Be Waiting.  That song defines the CD:  a breezy acoustic intro, a punchy soaring chorus, timbale breaks, and Rodrigo-y-Gabriela flamenco bridges all make this one a roller-coaster thrill ride.

{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen, here is another piece of evidence supporting the decision to award Paul Simon the Library Of Congress' Gershwin Prize for popular music. This album is a strong, vital piece or work. And like other albums in Simon's long and storied career it will offer multiple delights to those who actively immerse themselves into listening to it, hearing it multiple times. And then there are those who will dismiss is as more \"I-miss-the-old-stuff\" music. I feel sorry for them. This is a fine, melodic album featuring unusual and varied instrumentation and musical styles. More important perhaps is the fact that Simon's delicate, immediately recognizable quicksilver voice is in good shape. Hang in there while I try to place this in brief context.\n\nThe critical accolades that greeted the release of So Beautiful Or So What seems to have re-energized this brilliant, somewhat melancholic composer. At the ripe age of 74, Simon has produced another album that defies expectations and pushes the boundaries of his compositional style. A composer who values the role that rhythm plays in song (\"these are the roots of rhythm, and the roots of rhythm remain\") Simon has hired Italian dance club king Club! Club! to re-invigorate his approach of infusing his music with the rhythms of exotic instruments. (Like So Beautiful, this album is an aural wonder through a good pair of cans).\n\nThe rhythms themselves surround and envelop some wonderfully acerbic lyrics (the obit lyric quoted above is preceded by the lines: \"Milwaukee man led a fairly decent life\/made a fairly decent living, had a fairly decent wife. She killed him - sushi knife.\/Now they're shopping for a fairly decent afterlife. The werewolf is coming.\" Ah - The Afterlife. \"You got to fill out a form first\/And then you wait in the line.\"\n\nLike The Afterlife, it's easy to get caught up in the rhythms and not immerse yourself too deeply in the song itself. That would be a grave mistake - no pun intended. Just as The Afterlife dealt with the composer's imagined death, songs like \"\/In A Parade\" are not what they seem to be upon initial hearing. In the case of the latter, the parade refers an ER tech (nurse? physician?) delaying with an endless stream of patients with critical needs (\"Some nights the ER is quiet as an EKG\/But tonight it feels like every broken bone, tonight it feels like every wounded soul is filling out a form or on the phone.\/I can't talk now, I'm in a parade.) The song itself reflects Simon's desire to return to Mardi Gras; it's rhythmic foundation sounds as if he recruited every Mardi Gras Indian Chief to pound out the soul of New Orleans.\n\nAnd therein lays another level of genius in the music and the songs, of Paul Simon. They can be heard and appreciated on so many different levels - but they are typically not obtuse (i.e., Dylan) or treacly (i.e., McCartney) or musical re-treads (i.e, Taylor) as is the work of many of his contemporaries. Paul Simon continues to break new musical ground.\n\nI'm still absorbing this muic myself, and hope to add more detail to this review as I do so. I find it ludicrous to compare this album to earlier work, just as I find it ludicrous to compare it to Simon's alleged masterpiece Graceland, certainly his most important album. But at this early point, I think I would compare Stranger To Stranger to one of Simon's most under-rated albums, and one I would consider to be among his greatest works: Surprise. Each is an album that defies expectations. Each is an album that confounds some, while revealing great mysteries and connections with repeated listening over time. And each one is a statement of a true artist - a true genius if you'll allow me that - working at the peak of his creative powers at that particular moment of time in his life.\n\nIf this is the level of creativity and vitality associated with being 70+ years old, it isn't \"terribly strange\" at all. At a stage in life when artists can rest on their laurels and release albums of \"so what\", Simon has pushed himself to create another album that is \"so beautiful\" rather than \"so what\". Stranger To Stranger is so fresh, and full with the joy of discovery that it gives me something to look forward to as I move through the sixth decade of my own life. Well, unless the Werewolf becomes our next President and the riots of those without wristbands becomes prescient rather than merely clever.\n\nFinally, let me echo the sentiments of those who recommend purchase of this \"deluxe\" edition, particularly for the live performance of Duncan from Prairie Home Companion which is absolutely exquisite, and dare I say superior to the original. In this recording the pan-pipes in the refrain are replaced by two fiddles, which give the song an ageless Stephen-Fosteresque quality. Not only is this in keeping with its recording as part of PHC, but also elevates the stature of the song to that of a truly timeless classic.\n\nI feel fortunate to have grown older along with Paul Simon. He continues to provide meaningful entertainment. And inspiration.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"This is a score that I didn't think would ever come out as a CD release.  It appeared to be \"digital only\" but my patience paid off and Sparks & Shadows (which is a record label created by Bear McCreary) finally released it.  McCreary makes a great statement on the Sparks & Shadows website where he says, \"I value the soundtrack experience, because score records are what first led me down the path to becoming a composer\".  He goes on to say, \"I was a fan and a collector long before I became a professional musician. I have always looked for ways to deliver my original scores to fans so they can have the same experiences.\"  Let me say a big Thank You to Bear McCreary for looking out for the fans and collectors!\n\nI rarely get to go see movies in the theatre and out of all the ones that I am eagerly waiting to be released on BluRay, this one is probably the one that I am on pins and needles to see the most.  The reviews are great, the trailer looks mysterious, and the soundtrack is awesome!  One of the great things about the CD release is that it comes with a massive 24 page insert with photos from the movie, photos of the scoring recordings, musician credits, production notes, and a very detailed account of the score creation written by Bear McCreary.  The insert contains a fascinating account of how the score was developed and fun insights into McCreary's creativity as a musician and composer.  Some amazing facts about the score is how much McCreary studies the characters and the fact that he visits the set to get a feel for the movie and it's story.  I know many composers do this, but to hear McCreary's account of going to the movie set to study some of the smallest details like the vents\/air ducts in the bunker and feeling the claustrophobic atmosphere in some of the spaces is pretty intense.  McCreary's goal was to capture the musical sounds of the subterranean bunker and the people within.\n\nThe score opens with the beautiful piece entitled \"Michelle\" (track 1).  The cue begins with a single instrument, the Tanbur.  This exotic Middle Eastern instrument has been used by McCreary before in his \"Da Vinci's Demons\" TV scores.  What's interesting about this single instrument is that this cue and technique is inspired by McCreary's mentor, Elmer Bernstein.  Wow...didn't know that Bernstein was his mentor!  The liner notes state that Bernstein felt that the opening few seconds of a score were the most important because it was here that you would have the audience's full attention before they get lost within the visuals and story.  Bernstein felt that beginning a score with a single instrument that would represent the film, was a good practice and apparently one that McCreary has put into play within this soundtrack.  This opening track really does set up the entire score and I hear a sadness and mystery in it that sets a tone for the film.  McCreary plays with this theme throughout the score and I love the sound produced by this instrument.\n\nAnother interesting fact concerning this score is McCreary's use of a very unusual instrument known as the Blaster Beam.  I never even knew that this instrument even existed, yet I'm very familiar with the sound.  I actually thought it was just sound generated by an electronic keyboard.  It's basically a 12 to 18 foot long metal beam (sometimes made out of aluminum), that has wires under various degrees of tension that are struck with sticks, pipes, or fingers to create some very bizarre and amazing sounds.  Jerry Goldsmith used it for his \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" score as a way to identify V'ger.  I looked it up on YouTube and you can see some video demonstrations of the instrument.  McCreary contacted Craig Huxley, the same guy who played the instrument for the Star Trek film, and used him for this particular score.  A great piece in this score that highlights the Blaster Beam is \"Hazmat Suit\" (track 8).  You can hear this fascinating instrument throughout the score and McCreary uses it masterfully.\n\nMcCreary adds a lot of musical textures to this score including layered vocals by Raya Yarbrough on pieces like \"Howard\" (track 3) and various other unique instruments that create a gloomy, frightful, and mysterious atmosphere within this bunker and the people we are observing.  The score, sounds very classic to me, but with some unusual modern instrument enhancements.  Reviewer Paul Allaer mentioned that the score has a very Bernard Herrmann sound to it and I agree.  It has that Hitchcock movie vibe to it but also an ingenuity that gives it a sound of it's own.  The liner notes even mention McCreary and J.J. Abrams discussions concerning Herrmann and Goldsmith's styles.\n\nIt's simply a fascinating score to listen to and I really appreciate the great liner notes provided by Sparks & Shadows that bring a lot of insight into the making of the music.  Bear McCreary fans will not be disappointed with this release and the composer continues to shine with yet another amazing score.  The CD release contains 14 tracks with a running time of 64 minutes.  The CD insert is wonderful but the thing is so big that it barely fits into the insert slots on the front of the case!  It's a wonderful release and I highly recommend picking this one up!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Beating the sophomore slump and improving the game in the production department, Imagine Dragons aim for the bleachers in \"Smoke and Mirrors.\" Someone must have told them to get in touch with their inner U2, because much of the album looks to build anthems from scratch. For a change the reach does not exceed the grasp. \"Smoke and Mirrors\" hits its mark more often than not.\n\nThe first single, \"I Bet My Life\" exemplifies this direction. Pulsing verses with a chorus that looks to hit sing-along status where played, it adds some Mumford and Sons folk stomp to the mix while building to a crescendo climax. \"Shots\" has a guitar line worthy of The Edge, and \"I'm So Sorry\" brings back the distortion of the debut album with a raw intensity. But this time they sound like the screaming was intentional. That's a big difference from this album and the debut. The sucess of which seems to have given the band the courage to play every genre they ever had plans for in their incubation days.\n\nThat includes a bit of pomp to go with it. Who would have thought that the band that made the hooky \"Radioactive\" would end their second album with a six minute prog-rock opus? (And maybe the only misstep on an album that is quite assured of its footing.) Or that hints of the electronic dance would underpin \"Summer?\" Even if once in awhile they dip into the well that is Coldplay (\"Dream\"), \"Smoke and Mirrors\" is a surprisingly good album from Imagine Dragons, as they test their musical mettle.","classification":4,"fold":1}

Typical of British LPs, the outer jacket is of thinner stock than with U.S. albums. (NOTE: back cover notes misidentify \"You Know My Name\" as a stereo track.)\n\nSIDE ONE NOTES\n1.)

Another from the \"I Call Your Name\" EP, it's John's amazing Larry Williams cover. 7.) John beats the organ mercilessly on this \"Help\" 'B' Side. 8.)

The Beatles were at the height of their popularity and Motown was churning out one memorable tune after another. I went on vacation with my parents for two weeks in mid-July and when I returned a couple of hippies I had never heard of---Sonny and Cher--had several records on the charts!! It was difficult to decide which 45's to buy with the limited resources from my paper route. It was about this time that two rockers from Long Island teamed up with two folkies from Greenwich Village to form what would become the Lovin' Spoonful. They would become one of my all-time favorite bands. The debut single \"Do You Believe In Magic\" quickly raced up the charts and became a Top Ten smash. This is one of my 20 favorite singles of all-time.","classification":5,"fold":1}

At a time when Disco and hard Funk ruled the radio airwaves, Peabo recorded these two ballad-filled albums and ended up a real winner with two best-selling (both were certified Gold!) albums to his credit.

{"text":"Here is a very nice selection of Viennese waltzes and other dance music by the Strauss family and some of the other Viennese masters. At 99 cents its a no brainer to grab it, but let me list a few pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n1. Here we have 81 tracks of good music for just over 1 penny per track.\n2. You get a nice mix of familiar masterpieces and less well-known but appealing compositions.\n3. Waltzes are just plain fun.\n4. The fourth of the \"Six Contredanses\" by Beethoven (track 18) features a tune that later played a starring role in the finale of Beethoven's 3rd Symphony (Eroica). It's startling to hear this melody emerging from a stream of engaging but unfamiliar dances by this great composer. Beethoven deployed in this theme in what turned out to be the pivotal work in his middle and heroic period. In the process, he transformed and exalted the theme while retaining the same melodic outline.\n\nCons\n1. This is really sort of a Pro-and-Con: There are two conductors in the set, Anton Paulik and Willie Boskovsky. The latter leads his ensemble brilliantly, and all of his performances have that true Viennese lilt. Of course, Boskovsky later went on to fame and fortune as one of the prime interpreters of the Viennese waltz tradition. Paulik's performance are more middle-of-the-road. Not bad, but not really inspired, either. And since Paulik generally conducts the famous works of Johann Strauss, Jr.--Boskovsky gets very little of the Waltz King--we miss out on really primo performances of the best loved works in the canon. In some ways, the most appealing dimension of this set is the intro it offers to those lesser known works.\n2. There are, as often happens in these Bach Guild sets, some mislabelling issues. I this case it occurs through the duplication of track names: tracks 10, 17, 20, 58, and 64 all inaccurately duplicate the names of the previous tracks. But the music is different and the correct track names can be found here on the Bach Guild's own website: [...] Since Bach Guild has the correct data, the problem may be on amazon.com end, but it would be nicer to customers if they didn't have to do research to get accurate labeling of their tracks.\n\nSo a somewhat mixed bag, but as usual a nice offering from Bach Guild at a great price.","classification":4,"fold":1}

Ironing out the rough edges of All The Yound Dudes with this well produced sounding batch of songs Mott never strayed from their roots of hard melodic rock and folk ballads with strings that reach a crescendo of guitar fused power. Ian Hunter sneers like a British Dylan and the energy of rockers like Little Richard the temperment of the Velvet Underground,hippie leanings of folkies like Melanie never leaves their music.\n\nMott's songs remain winners to this day and takes the All The Young Dudes sound further by giving a polish to that rougher sounding diamond that was All The Young Dudes.\n\nBoth are essential with the followup The Hoople cd a great listen of great songs but lacks the cohesive feel of Mott and is somehow a paler imitation of Mott, nonetheless all 3 cd's are wonderful.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Katherine McPhee possesses a genius that I rarely hear or enjoy; just one listen to this awesome CD proves she's got what it takes to be a major, long-lasting force both as a singer and a songwriter! Katherine's voice is wonderful to hear; her sophisticated phrasing and her excellent diction enhance everything she sings and that's terrific. In addition, Katherine can use her voice to naturally convey a certain vulnerability with which so many people can identify; and she's maturing more and more. The songs on this disc are all wonderful; there's really not a single dud in the bunch. I love it! The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent; and the artwork is very nicely done.\n\n\"It's Not Right\" starts the track set with Katherine squarely in the spotlight--and those guitars, drums, key modulations and more make \"It's Not Right\" a strong opener for this album. Katherine's music really grabs me by the throat and never lets me go! In addition, \"Had It All\" gets the royal treatment from Katherine; she delivers this with panache and I think you'll like it a lot. Sure, the lyrics are not exactly happy as Katherine sings about a relationship someone realizes was great only after the breakup; but that not so sad music manages to fuse well with the words to the song and \"Had It All\" comes out a winner. \"Keep Drivin'\" has a splendid musical arrangement to accompany Katherine's vocals; the music is just right but wisely they keep Katherine's vocals front and center; you never have to struggle to hear what she's singing.\n\n\"Last Letter\" is quite well done; Katherine sings this with genuine passion and there's yet another gem about loving yourself in \"Surrender.\" \"Surrender\" really is a standout with that melody; and Katherine sings this as if it were all so easy--but of course it isn't all that easy. Katherine McPhee's talent carries her through. \"Terrified\" is most emotional and I also enjoy \"How\" which is about a woman who isn't sure just how to get over a very painful breakup. \"How\" has a fine beat and Katherine sings this tune without ever letting go of a single superfluous note! I admire how well Katherine handles songs like \"How.\"\n\n\"Say Goodbye\" is very poignant; and the piano arrangement helps to make the music sound so good--what a memorable tune about the inevitability of a relationship breakup! Katherine sings this from the bottom of her heart and you can hear the angst in her voice; she delivers this all THAT sensitively. \"Faultline\" is another number that I won't forget anytime soon; Katherine makes this outstanding with her impeccable voice that conveys all the subtle nuances of the lyrics to \"Faultline.\" \"Anybody's Heart\" is another sensitive number with guitar work I love; Katherine gives us quite a fine performance of this ballad.\n\n\"Lifetime\" has an arrangement that is very creative; and those key modulations make this number brilliant. Katherine handles the complex tempo and key changes like the pro she is and will remain--great! \"Lifetime\" has excellent percussion, too. \"Unbroken,\" the very deep and meaningful title song, features Katherine again singing her heart out; and I'm very moved by her performance. \"Brand New Key\" is a terrific cover of a song by Melanie; what an impressive, lively way to end the album--it also leaves me wanting more.\n\nAnd, if we're lucky, more is precisely what we'll get from this stellar young talented songbird and songwriter. Katherine McPhee has a very bright future ahead of her; I can't wait to hear her next album!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"This is one of my favorite DM albums.  The other reviewers cover it pretty well, but I have to put my 2 in about one thing.  \"If You Want\" is not a filler song.  In fact, it is my favorite off this album.  The vocals, the lyrics, the synth...it captured me from the first time i listened to it.  Granted that was 15 years ago, but I still love it.  The band remixed just about every other song they ever made, why they passed this one by is a mystery to me.  I'd be curious to see if other DM fans feel the same way.  I have all their albums and 99% of everything else, including their 3 boxed sets of singles so i think I know what I'm talking about.\nIf you are new to Depeche Mode, start of with the single collections or greatest hits CD.

{"text":"It amazed me that TIK TOK managed to somehow find its way to #1, but I will be honestly surprised if BLAH fails to ring the bell in short order as well: a MUCH stronger single, BLAH clocks in at 2:52, making it the current go-to record at radio for the \"12 songs an hour\" nonsense currently being run at clear-channel affiliates -- shorter songs do equal more commercials within the context of such radio promos, and we all know how CC feels about that concept.\n\nBLAH feels, musically, like a L'Trimm\/Lady Gaga mash-up; lyrically it's Salt-n-Pepa with a side of Lil' Kim. The hooks are plenty: a chirping keyboard (which is, itself, essentially the entire chord structure) feels like a lighter version of what pushed Buffalo Stance; the chorus itself is hooky in a way that I can't quite put my finger on (I suspect it's an interplay between various recording levels). It's really, REALLY well done, and is a profoundly likable record.\n\nAs a result of TIK TOK and BLAH, Ke$ha is now, essentially, the queen of white Female rap: it's a position achieved by default, however, and her sophomore album will have to be MUCH stronger than her first effort here -- if Ke$ha expects to make a career out of this. Even if BLAH does hit #1 -- a feat which will give her two #1's in a row -- I strongly suspect that Ke$ha will end-up being another forgotten name in the annals of pop. The brightest flames DO burn the quickest.\n\nFor now, though, BLAH is the perfect record for Ke$ha: an exceptionally strong follow-up to TIK TOK, radio-friendly in both length and sound, risque enough lyrically to generate buzz, with MASSIVE ringtone & remix potential.\n\nKe$ha, seriously: save some money.\n\nIt's a quick ride.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"The Beatles-Help ****\n\nHelp! is far from the five star classic it is being labeled but it was a precursor to what was to come from the boys. Just around the corner the four lads would release five of the greatest albums in music history, so for me this plays as a warm up lap around the recording studio.\n\nThe title track 'Help' really was a personal cry for help from John Lennon, and not to mention on of the groups best. 'Yesterday' is the very best song McCartney ever recorded, it also went on to become the most covered song in history with well over five hundred version to date. 'Hide Your Love Away' would have fit better on Rubber Soul but is a nice addition to Help! ''The Night Before' is pretty catchy and Paul was really on to something here, and 'Ticket To Ride' might be the strongest thing The Beatles ever recorded. John was a true genius. As for the rest of the songs, honestly they are take it or leave it, and just because they are the Beatles does not make them great songs.\n\nOnce again while I don't think this is necessarily a classic I do think it is worth owning and one of the best 'early' Beatles albums.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"They rose to the top of the pop music world virtually overnight!  This talented quintet, originally known as the Versatiles, formed in Los Angeles in 1966 and within a year they had secured a recording contract with Johnny Rivers' fledgling Soul City label. Rivers loved the sound but hated their name and as a result group member Ron Townsend came up with the name we would all come to know so well...The Fifth Dimension. And it did not take very long for the group to make its presence felt.  Their very first release \"Go Where You Wanna Go\" cracked the Billboard Top 20. Just five months later the group would score a major hit with Jimmy Webb's \"Up Up and Away\".  Yes, the Fifth Dimension was on its way!  Over the next six years the group would prove to be a dominant force in American popular music amassing a total of nearly 30 charted singles and a dozen hit albums. All in all, the group boasted an impressive total of 14 gold records for their efforts.\n\n\"The Ultimate Fifth Dimension\" from Arista records features just about all of the important hit singles most folks would remember from the radio.  Enjoy once again some of the early pop favorites including songs like \"Stoned Soul Picnic \", \"Sweet Blindness\", and \"Save the Country\" all from the pen of talented songwriter Laura Nyro.  And of course no Fifth Dimension collection would be complete without the rollicking 60's anthem \"Aquarius\/Let The Sunshine In\" from the summer of 1969. Oddly enough, that one happens to be one of my least favorite 5D tunes. I would also like to recommend to you some of their groups less popular tunes including \"Workin' On A Groovy Thing\", \"Carpet Man\" from 1967 as well as one of my personal favorites \"Ashes To Ashes\", a tune that went largely unnoticed back in 1973.\n\nThe music industry and fans alike were shocked when Marilyn McCoo and  Billy Davis Jr. announced that they were leaving the group in 1975. The husband and wife team recorded \"You Don't Have To Be A Star\" for ABC records in 1976 and it climbed all the way to #1.  McCoo and Davis went on to appear in a number of successful Broadway productions. And what became of the rest of the Fifth Dimension?  Original members Florence LaRue, Lamont McLemore and Ron Townsend managed to keep the group together and continued to make appearances around the country. However, the days of the Fifth Dimension as chartbusters had long since come to an end.\n\nIn the summer of 1991, all five members of the original Fifth Dimension agreed to reunite for a series of concerts, It was the first time that they had worked together in 15 years. I was lucky enough to catch one of those shows. And believe me the magic was still there!  Unfortunately, Ron Townsend would pass away in 2001. For those who consider themselves huge fans of the Fifth Dimension you just might consider reaching a little deeper into your pocket and investing in the 1997 2 CD set \"Up Up and Away: The Definitive Collection\".  That collection offers a total of 36 terrific tracks as well as an extremely well done booklet.  But for just about anybody else \"The Ultimate Fifth Dimension\" would be a great choice. No re-records here.  These are all the original Soul City and Bell recordings you owned years ago.  Take my word for it.  This is one disc you are sure to play again and again and again.  Highly recommended!","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"This is a great song, even if it does have cheesy lyrics and is very bubblegum. It has a well-crafted beat that is built on retro-disco strings. The lyrics are actually clever. It does feature a theme that has not been thought of before.  And they are so CATCHY.  With the excellent beat and irresistible lyrics, it is irrelevant that the song is cheesy. After all, it's pop music.\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen has just an okay voice in my opinion, though.  However, it's just as good as most of the pop artists out there and actually better than a handful of them. She's no Adele or even Rihanna, but it's better than Katy Perry.\n\nI look forward to see what's next from the Canadian starlet that came out of nowhere in America.","classification":5,"fold":1}

I listened to this album yesterday while heading down to Wakefield's Weather Office and found I couldn't stop listening to it! If you think Call My Name is as good as it gets, I recommend buying the whole album. Third Day's creativity and style for each song will blow you away!

Yet, when Trent heard JC's version, he was truly impressed.  So am I.  This was recorded by Cash just after the death of his wife June Carter Cash, and shortly before he himself died.  I can hear the heartbreak in his voice.  He sounds old and weary, yet that works so well for him in this song.  This was truly his last iconic hit, in my opinion.  I love performing this song at karaoke, since I have a deep voice.  But it is incredibly challenging and difficult to achieve his style.  I've done it before, but it seems only by accident.  Cash is truly a master songwriter and performer, and this track is truly an exclamation mark on his entire repertoire.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"If the gang on \"Scooby-Doo\" met Karen O and decided to form a punk band, it would probably sound a lot like Be Your Own Pet. Part Saturday morning cartoon, part suburban punk, Be Your Own Pet pack relentlessly raucous rhythms and frenzied attitude into twelve songs that rush by like a Japanese Bullet Train. It takes less than thirty minutes to play all of `Get Awkward,' but that's enough to leave a permanent mark.\n Most of the bandmembers have reached their golden (post-teen) years since their debut album was released two tears ago, but thankfully, they haven't quite yet settled into maturity. There's still plenty of songs about feeling awkward (see the title?) such as \"The Beast Within,\" and goofy youth fantasy tunes like \"Zombie Graveyard Party,\" but most of the album revolves around experiences that have befallen them since their rise to recognition (or are they already `famous'?), combining lots of attitude with a generous dose of humor. \"Bitches Leave\" is a funny and poignant rant about girls who bring their attitude backstage. \"You're a Waste\" summarizes a blown relationship with an idiot ex, with these lines; \"Go ahead and tell your sob story, all I have to say about it is `Blow Me'. As sung by female vocalist Jemina Pearl, the line cuts to the bone while it makes you laugh.\n Perhaps the best thing about Be Your Own Pet is their ability to communicate beyond their own peer group. Anybody who listened to early Blondie or the Buzzcocks will appreciate the intelligent songcraft of this band's songwriting. If you have to grow up, you may as well enjoy it, but on \"Get Awkward,\" Be Your Own Pet make it clear that they are too busy enjoying themselves to be bothered. Since they can make music as infectious as this, why should they?  B+ Tom Ryan","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Major Harris releases his debut album My Way in 1974-75.  He has a cool vibin' voice and flows easy over the melody: no wonder why the Delfonics had him join them in the early 70's after Randy Cain (R.I.P.) left.  Here, he gets some solo shine and makes a wonderful record with different tempos and styles.  The hit single: \"Love Won't Let Me Wait\"  is a cool-vibin, jazzy, classy number, with some orgasmic girl moans at the end of the slow drag.  \"Sideshow\" is a mellow cover of a Blue Magic classic jam, and Major Harris handles it well.  Other slower jams include \"Just a Thing I Do\" and \"My Way.\"  The other songs are more up-tempo and also are spirit and soul up-lifters.  \"Sweet Tomorrow\" is gorgeous, poetic, and romantic.  The swinging vibe of \"Loving You Is Mellow\" with the heavenly chorus chants is another mood lifter.  All the songs on My Way are great: Major Harris has a great voice.  Anyone who loves anything from Motown to Philly Soul and even softer Disco will love this wonderful album.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"It never ceases to amaze me how,after more than a decade and a half,that my reaction to hearing the Jackson 5 every time provides me with more and more excitement. What can I say? Historically this was the first major group of young black men to come up in the post Civil Rights era musical world. Of course what's always been even more interesting about all of this is the fact that their recording career for Motown was continuous throughout. Between that and touring,it must have been tiring for three teenage boys who'd generally not even get tired. Whether it was \"Papa Joe's\" silent generation strictness or just their strong musical ambitions? In the end the Jackson brothers recorded what seemed like enough music for them to release an album quarterly (at least) for their entire Motown run. In terms of soul\/funk music? I noticed rarities of the genre have seldom gotten the type of positive outlook of the unreleased material of more folk based artist. Maybe because they are often miss-classified by people as performers rather than artful singer\/songwriters. That's one reason why I almost made the mistake of giving this boxed set the slip at first. Knowing what I already did about them? I am glad I didn't do that.\n\n  The first disc of this two CD set focuses on their prime commercial period. \"(We're The) Music Makers\" is an intense hard funk groove wherein each of the brothers introduces themselves. \"Come And Get It (Love's On Fire\",\"I Got A Sure Thing\",sung by Jermaine,\"Movin'\",\"You'd Better Watch Out\",\"I'm Your Sunny One (He's My Sunny Boy)\" and a cover of the Temptations classic \"Since I Lost My Baby\" are classic 70's Motown style Jackson Five-full of their trademark hook filled melodies. A steamy and funky version of \"Mama Told Me Not To Come\" finds the brothers trading off vocals on a song that...alright seems alternately a little adult for their age until Mike humorously utters \"I don't want to miss the Flintstones\". \"Feelin' Alright\" is a monster,Crusaders like electric piano based jazz-funk styled version of the Traffic classic with a powerful gospel\/soul vocal harmony on the final chorus. Iddinit\",\"After You Leave Girl\" and \"Keep An Eye\" get that same flavor whereas. \"Someone's Standing In My Love Light\" sounds like a heavily orchestrated uptempo Holland\/Dozier\/Holland production even if it isn't. And it allows the 12 year old Michael to really exercise his Diana Ross-like inflections of the type\n\n  Its that same orchestral flavor that continues onto Disc 2 with \"If You Want Heaven\"-recorded during that same period. Otherwise this disc is devoted to the Jacksons' final few years with Motown. Its also present on \"I Can't Get Enough You\"-recorded when Mike's voice was really starting to lower significantly. The upbeat \"Our Love\" is a similar styled tune with another Jermaine lead. The Supremes \"You Can't Hurry Love\" is given a funkier groove than the bouncy girl group sound of the original and the Drifters \"Up On The Roof\" is given a similarly radical uptempo treatment. \"Going My Way\" is a sleek Jermaine sung ballad while \"Makin  Life A Little Easier For You\" benefits from a leaner and more upfront bass\/guitar groove while the shuffling \"Cupid\" finds an odd 60's type Motown beat from the Jackson's final years of Motown and showcasing Mike's fully changed voice. \"Keep Off The Grass\",\"Would Ya Would Ya Baby\" and in particular the home wrecking lyricism of \"Jumbo Sam\"-with their grooving percussion and wah-wah guitars, illustrate the Jacksons' harder psychedelic funk\/soul of their&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Get-It-Together\/dp\/B002Y4Z4UQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Get It Together<\/a>&nbsp;period (my personal favorite by them) while \"Let's Go Back To Day One\" and \"Love Trip\" reflect a transition between their earlier style of uptempo music and their later,harder edged variation of that. The bonus tracks include a demo of \"That's How How Is\" and a \"Mama's Pearl\" demo called \"Guess Who's Making Whoopee\"-with completely different lyrical and melodic content vocally.\n\n  One of the first things I noticed about this box set is how much it continually emphasizes that the Jackson Five were a funk oriented group. Michael Jackson is now often considered perhaps one of the last singers,writers and performers of melodically inclined uptempo music. And the fact that these two discs are devoted primarily to fast and funky material showcases how James Brown and Jackie Wilson influenced Mike and his brothers were in the sense of their performances guiding their every musical move. Also heard here are perhaps a revealing look at the source of their creative differences with Motown. While ably performed,some of the songs recorded during their latter period here are very much in the cutesier vein of 60's Motown girl groups. I can't imagine why,with the soulful vocal instrumental it was apparent the teenage MJ was beginning to possess why Motown would direct the growing brothers in this musical direction. Jackie and Tito are known for their interest in the music of Norman Whitfield and P-Funk's type of psychedelic funk\/soul. And one can see here when the material is more geared that way,which is actually is much of the time,the Jacksons' performances are in their best form and vitality. While it is still available,I strongly encourage all Jackson and Motown admirers to check out this set! It helps to understand the Jacksons' beyond their commercial\/hit context and how memorable (not to mention insanely funkified) their entire body of musical work really was.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Susan Boyle's honeyed, fairy godmother-like vocal presence pours over the 35 minutes of \"The Gift\" with grace, restraint and high levels of listenability. It has all the effortless warmth of a loving embrace - an apt trait for a Christmas recording.\n\nShe has a talent only a select few vocalists have had - the seemingly effortless ability to sing with profound sincerity, depth and knowledge - not intellectual knowledge, but emotional knowledge - the kind Karen Carpenter had, for instance. There is not a trace of smugness or self-interest in the way she sings, which makes her stand out from the majority of recent young performers whose performances make them appear to be their own biggest fans.\n\nWhile they sing for their own self-adulation and gain, Boyle is one of the rare ones who sing for the listener with earnestness. From phrase to phrase she gives of herself. It is not just for her sake.\n\nThe song selections are enough to set \"The Gift\" apart from other holiday albums. Boyle's reinterpretation of Lou Reed's \"Perfect Day\" favors an optimistic reading of its ambiguous lyrics, bringing devotion - either of a religious or familial kind - to the forefront, with a gorgeous, powerful choir and superb musicians. She also injects Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\" with subtle, delicate grace. The lyrics and their meanings ring clear. She sings like a painter paints, with care and attention to detail. Her love for the material shows.\n\nThis also shows in her unexpected, profoundly stirring take on Crowded House's career-hit \"Don't Dream It's Over.\" The original was contemplative, moody and chilly, with Neil Finn's desperate, anguished delivery. He sounded like he was trying to stop someone on the brink of making a fatal mistake. Boyle, on the other hand, reimagines the song as one of strength, protection and affirmation - of renewed possibilities on a sunny horizon.\n\n\"Auld Lang Syne\" benefits from its simple, unaffected arrangement that lets Boyle's voice take center stage. This stands in contrast to the pillowy, over-eager production values that both obscure her voice and reveal its limitations where they need not. However, this occurs on a limited basis, and her talent overcomes it.\n\n\"O Holy Night\" suits Boyle's voice ideally, and she sings the song - which tempts many singers into hammy bombast - with class and generosity.  \"Make Me a Channel of Your Peace,\" which is more customary as a church hymn, is similarly soothing and restful. Boyle finds great strength from choosing simple truth over trite embellishment, making the title of the song especially apt.\n\nBoyle has put her talent to fine use on \"The Gift.\" The richness of her voice and her uncensored, heart-on-sleeve quality lend themselves to Christmas as naturally as cookies and milk, creating a comforting, elegant (albeit brief) album to enjoy for many holidays to come.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"In the music world, no one has influenced a great deal of people like Johnny Cash. His influence spans across generations, songwriters and even music genres. From artists donning all black attire (Run DMC, Depeche Mode), walking the thin line between the sacred and the profane (DMX, Scarface), and refusing to label themselves (Beck), all of that was spawned from the Man In Black. So in 2010, American Recordings released the final installment \"American VI: Ain't No Grave\".\n\nLike all other albums in this series, it was produced by Rick Rubin and it is considerably short clocking in at a little over 30 minutes. The album starts off with the title track which is also the first single, in which he sings \"Ain't no grave that can hold my body down\". It's a rather eerie statement- especially if you consider that he passed away in 2003. Following it is the Sheryl Crow song \"Redemption Day\" and later the Kris Kristofferson penned \"For The Good Times\" a song that was made famous by Al Green almost 40 years ago. Just about all of the songs are cover songs with the exception of \"I Corinthians 15:55\" which is the lone Johnny Cash composition. The album ends with the excellent track \"Aloha Oe\", and as soon as the song ends, you will want to play this album all over again in its entirety. In short, Johnny Cash has the best album out right now. Not just in country...in music, period.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Burl Ives really isn't remembered as much as he should be these days; and that's a shame. On this album Burl sings wonderfully; and his friendly, grandfatherly vibes go into every song he sings! This CD is a must-have for fans of Burl; and anyone who wants some very special holiday songs would do well to add this to their music collection. The quality of the sound is very good and the artwork is very nicely done.\n\nThe title track opens the album; this catchy, infectiously happy and upbeat tune could never go out of style; and Burl practically owns this song the way he delivers it. He puts a lot of positive energy into his version of this song; and it shows quite clearly when I hear him perform it. Great! \"Christmas Is a Birthday\" is very easy on the ear; what a charming ballad--and it's religious, too. \"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\" switches gears back to a more secular song; Burl puts his own stamp on this tune by playing a bit with the tempo and a few key changes--and it all holds its own very well.\n\n\"White Christmas\" glows brighter than silver and gold combined when Mr. Ives sings it; that background chorus rounds out the number nicely although wisely the arrangement makes it so that they can't attempt to share the spotlight with Burl. \"The Little Drummer Boy\" has another terrific arrangement; the percussion and guitar are used very well and the music fits perfectly with Burl Ives' singing. In addition, \"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer\" leaves nothing to be desired--this music is all THAT good!\n\n\"Winter Wonderland\" shines bright in Burl's capable hands; I really like this number. \"Silver Bells\" couldn't have been done any better and the CD ends with Burl Ives performing \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.\" I haven't heard this number as often as I've heard the other tunes on this CD but it's really quite beautiful and it even leaves me wanting more.\n\nBurl Ives turned out a wonderful record album back in 1965; and it's amazingly wonderful to have this on CD in our times so that we can enjoy it over and over again. I highly recommend this album; it's full of splendid holiday music.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I am a late bloomer when it comes to Built To Spill. I didn't hear a Built To Spill album till 2008, and that album was Keep It Like A Secret. Hell of an album to be initiated into the BTS fraternity, for sure. When I first heard it I wasn't sure what I was hearing. Up to that point my idea of Built To Spill was completely off from the reality of Doug Martsch and company. I thought they were one of those twee indie bands that hatched from some ultra sensitive egg laid in the Pacific Northwest by long gone dinosaurs of an indie rock prehistoric era. Maybe some of that was right, but most of what I thought Built To Spill were was completely and utterly wrong.\n\nStill, after two listens to that 1999 album I was hooked. There was something about the way Doug Martsch wrapped his heartfelt, Neil Young-esque voice around the buzzing, jangly single coil riffs that felt almost like an out-of-body experience. You felt as if you were floating above yourself as you listened these songs of existential longing and \"might-as-well-drink-another-beer-cause-what's-left-to-do\" indifference. These were slacker anthems for the slacker that grew up and got the job and family and mortgage. The guy that sat at the kitchen table at 1am and worried about how he was going to pay the bills for the month. Music for the suburban blues.\n\nMartsch may not have been singing to me, but he was singing to me, man.\n\nI'm coming to Built To Spill at a time where they've been established. Doug Martsch is no longer building his empire of heavy-hearted, tortured clock punchers and everyday Joes and Janes. His empire is established. His artistry has been proven. He's the bearded poet for the disenfranchised and the clock punchers. At this point everything he creates in Built To Spill is for him. You like it? Great. You love it? Great. You wish it sounded more like (insert favorite Built To Spill album here), well go listen to (favorite Built To Spill album) and be happy.\n\nUntethered Moon isn't something new. It's not a game changer. It's not the dismantling of the BTS sound and that sound rebuilt into something completely different. Untethered Moon is Doug Martsch simply writing songs only Doug Martsch can write. Unlike There Is No Enemy, this new album is concise, to the point, and engaging from start to finish. Compact, existential musings on what it all means. Beautiful pop melodies buzzing with life and overloaded into warm, glowing tubes. \"On The Way\", \"Never Be The Same\", and \"Horizon To Cliff\" are up there with the best. Folksy and whimiscal, with a hint of sadness under the surface. \"All Our Songs\", \"Living Zoo\", and \"Another Day\" buzz like bees in a kicked coffee can. \"Some Other Song\" even sports an opening riff not unlike Rush' \"Working Man\". Not a bad thing, man. Not at all. \"So\" sounds like Jimi Hendrix sitting in with The Jicks on a sweaty summer jam somewhere in Boise. And \"When I'm Blind\"? It's an all-out guitar assault that has Built To Spill at their most consistently rocking since \"Conventional Wisdom\" brought tears to my eyes as I stood a mere 10 feet from Doug Martsch and company playing it live in 2009.\n\nI may have come to the Built To Spill party a bit late, but if Untethered Moon is any indication the party won't be ending anytime soon. Well into a storied musical history, Doug Martsch is still writing vital, poignant, and beautifully jangly rock n' roll songs. What more do you need?","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I have been a die hard Beatles fan forever. There isn't too many things I can remember when I was 7 years old but I still remember watching The Ed Sullivan Show way back one Sunday night in February of 1964 when the Beatles appeared causing a sensation bringing Beatlemania from England across the Atlantic to the U.S. Their music was like nothing ever heard before and would influence songwriters and musicians to this day.\n\nTheir songbook seems to be endless from all the great hits they had during their time together. To try to list all their greatest songs would take too much time and space for this review. For me though even more time consuming would be trying to pick which is my favorite song by the Fab Four. Just too many outstanding tunes to choose from. Most times you could say my favorite Beatles song is whichever one of theirs I happen to be listening to at that moment. If on the other hand you were to ask me to come up with a top ten list of the Beatles best songs there is one song in particular that would in my book make it somewhere on that list, the song is \"Rain\". A really great Beatles song that is while a great one is little known and overlooked by many fans.\n\nOne reason is it never charted. It also never appeared on any of the Beatles albums. In fact it was released in 1966 as the B side to the Beatles hit single \"Paperback Writer\". This is however I feel a song that deserved to be the A side on any single. It has everything a great song needs insightful lyrics, great beat, great guitar work that combined grabs your attention.  This was recorded at the time the Beatles were transitioning their sound from the mop top \"She loves you yeah yeah yeah\" kind of music to being more experimental with their sound and creative with their words. For the true Beatles fanatic this is certainly one of their songs that has to be considered for download onto your iPod or smart phone.","classification":5,"fold":1}

It is part of a group of the \"Rise of the Masters\" collections that I purchased for my son's sensory integration therapy. They aren't able to get him to wear headphones for the Auditory Integration Therapy at his occupational therapy clinic, and some studies have indicated the listening to traditional unmodulated classical music can have similar benefits, so I purchased this along with several others. So, while I have another version of the \"Messiah\" in particular that I prefer to this,  I feel like this has met the need for which it was purchased, and I'm a huge fan of the price point.","classification":5,"fold":1}

Hats off to Edgar Froese for continuing his pioneering efforts!\n\nIn my opinion, Booster is one of the best Tangerine Dream albums in my large collection of their stuff over the years.

{"text":"One thing I'll say about Van Morrison right off the back is that he's been an enormous success with having only a handful of iconic hits. He's one of a handful of artists who has re-defined what popular acclaim in the pop music world actually means. And with his nearly half century career as a solo artist? He's amassed 360 original songs in his back catalog. The man's music was part of the soundtrack (along with people such as Stevie Wonder) of me coming to understand melodic,soulful pop music as beautiful art. He's a veteran artist today,who likely records mainly for his deep interest in the music than any other factor. For this album? He decided to gather together many like minded artists,contemporary and from his own era,to basically remix selected numbers from that backlog of songs as duets with them. Something I've really been looking forward to hearing.\n\n  \"Some Peace Of Mind\" opens the album with a stomping,melodic funky soul number with the late great Bobby Womack that has a bouncing piano\/guitar interaction to it. \"If I Ever Needed Someone\" brings in an organ fueled southern gospel\/soul ballad with Mavis Staples. \"Higher Than High\" brings in a shuffling jazzy soul\/funk vibe with George Benson doing an great job copying Van's growling vocals as a duet partner with his trademark virtuoso guitar.  The piano\/guitar based ballads of \"Wild Honey\",\"Carrying A Torch\" and \"Streets Of Arklow\" with Joss Stone,Clare Teal and Simply Red's Mick Hucknell respectively all bring out Van's at his slow jazz best.  \"What Ever Happened To PJ Proby\" features the man himself on a shuffling blues\/jazz stomp asking each other about singer\/songwriter Scott Walker. Gregory Porter shows up for \"The Eternal Kansas City\" and gives it a Mardi Gras friendly Crescent City uptempo R&B vibe.\n\n  \"These Are The Days\" showcases Natalie Cole on a mid-tempo country folk\/soul vibe which also translates to \"Rough God Goes Riding\" recorded with daughter Shana. \"Get On With The Show\" brings in longtime Morrison collaborator Georgie Fame for a wall of sound style Northern Soul sound while \"Fire In The Belly\" brings in Steve Winwood for a Spanish style jazzy samba. Chris Farlowe brings out this tremendous bluesy soul stomp on \"Born To Sing\". Mark Knopfler brings a melodic folk\/rock flavor to \"Irish Heartbeat\",of course originally recorded with the Chieftains. \"Real Real Gone\" brings an upbeat Motown beat along with Michael Buble while Taj Mahal\" shows up for the unusually timed blues of \"How Can A Poor Boy\" to end the album with it's thick mix of guitar,horns,organ and horns. Not to mention their often free associative vocal punches.\n\n  To be honest? Van Morrison's musical approach had already aged to it's own sense of perfection by the end of the 1980's. The best he could honestly do after that was find new ways of writing and singing within that very flexible sound he'd created. On this album? He actually takes yet another spin on it all. Whatever genre the songs on this album come from at their core? The basic feeling of the songs all come out of think blues,funky grooves and silky smooth soul. It's always nice to hear someone else do an excellent version of a Van Morrison song. That being said,when the man himself does it to himself? The results are breathtaking. He also had the good taste to bring in not only the best suited but the most individually creative artists to work with for this album too. There is absolutely no disappointment coming from hearing this album. And I highly recommend it for anyone seeking music full of unadulterated musical and human soul!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Mary Lambert's 1st full-length set sparkles.  Where there are some flags to wave whose causes may endear the disc to some such as lesbian issues and heavyset body images, ultimately it is the music and Mary's passionate singing that sell this.  \"Secrets\" opens the disc with a rap-like laundry list of self-examined issues and blooms into a chorus of carefree bliss, \"So-oh-oh-oh what?\"  Mary's cover of the Rick Springfield hit \"Jessie's Girl\" grabs your attention as she takes the rocker and transforms it into a piano ballad, \"Where can I find a woman like that?\"  \"Monochromatic\" is a powerful ballad that starts simply and then adds instruments to make it an aching anthem, \"My heart's too big for this city; My heart's too big for my own body; My heart's too big for you to understand me.\"  \"Sum of Our Parts\" concludes the set with a lovely original melody.  Mary is from Seattle and studied classical music before moving into pop.  This is a delightful freshman set.  Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"This is a necessary album, and I'm very thankful that Ry Cooder has recorded it and released it in time for the US elections this year. I fear, however, that he is preaching to the choir, so to speak. Obviously, what he's saying in these songs is going to annoy or anger a great many conservatives. Thus, I'm not surprised that so many of the right-wing loony faction have taken offense to Ry's political views and given this album only 1 star. Typical of such dull-witted, myopic hate-mongers. Ah, I know, I shouldn't lower myself to their level and resort to juvenile name calling, but these folks are such easy targets, it's so hard to resist! But back to the album at hand: no, it's not Ry's best. I'd give it only 3 to 4 stars for musical composition and originality, but I bump up the rating for the brilliant lyrical content and Ry's very heartfelt effort to wake up the nation and make people realize that the US is in trouble ... but not for the reasons that so many of the right wing believe. It's the spirit of musicians like Ry Cooder (and also Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Bruce Springsteen, and Steve Earle) that once made America great, and made people proud to be Americans. I hope we never lose that voice. And I hope Ry Cooder keeps making music, however flawed or cliched, as long as it's packed with this much emotion and honesty.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I'm sorry, friends, after twenty years of listening, buying hundreds of CD's and an improved stereo I now know CD's don't have enough bits. They don't capture all the sound that was in the original vinyl recordings. 44k and 2 to the 14th power was NOT enough samples (bits). Like looking at an old newspaper picture made out of large dots, it's not like a photo. Like a primitive digital print without enough pixels. Poor resolution.\n\nWith 4 times as many time slices (increments) in the x direction and 2 to the 8th power, 256 more bits (increments) in the Y direction, this SACD is the only format which really captures the sound of the original LP or master tape. You cannot hear the difference between this and the LP. It's the real thing.\n\nIf you thought CD's sound harsh, or bass-thin, not like a concert, well, you were right!\n\nBeyond that, this album is the second best selling Jazz album of all time, behind Miles Davis \"Kind of Blue\". A timeless classic of the early sixties. \"The Girl From Ipanema\" was in the top ten songs on the Rock, Pop and Jazz Billboard charts for over a year in the '63-'64 time frame.\n\nYeah it's really that good!\n\n Hear Stan the Man effortlessly pour out his soul in the bridge of \"Corcovado\", for example.

{"text":"This is a great album from Spoon.  I like the variety of songs on this album.  \"They Want My Soul\" and \"Do You\" are two lyrically meaningful songs for me.  These tunes forces me to reflect on my place in the world and how my life is going.  The lead vocals of Britt Daniel is superb here.  \"Outlier\" is the purest rock song on the album.  The tone of this song just oozes energy.  This song is about living life on the edge.  \"Inside Out\" is a slower paced song.  I think this song features a harp playing.  This is a kind of song that makes me forget about all my problems.  I also like the song \"Rainy Taxi\".  I don't know why this song is entitled Rainy Taxi, but I like it.  I think this song is about the conflict that happens between two people in a relationship.  This song has a groovy tone.  Jim Eno provides a surge of energy on the drums on this song.  I like it very much.  Rob Pope provides funky guitar riffs on the song \"Knock Knock Knock\".  This song does not touch me lyrically like the others, but I enjoy listening to it.

{"text":"This album shows what truly made the Bee Gees great and that they stood on their own merit of great songs and wonderful productions.  This album is their Crowning Achievement of the 4 they would release in the 1960's in only a short 2 year period!  This remaster was done wonderfully and even has the original red velvet cover with the big gold lettering of the original.  As an earlier reviewer stated, this album definitely got the royal treatment!  From a historical perspective, Odessa was such a strong statement by the band and was one of three epic double albums released that year by a British Band, the other 2 being \"Tommy\" by the Who and \"White\" album as it's called by the Beatles.\n\nAlthough never really thought of in this way, the Bee Gees were a part of the last wave of the \"British Invasion\" bands and were, even at their young age, contemporaries of the other bands such as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Who, Yardbirds, etc.  This album was the one that there manager, Robert Stigwood, really wanted to be a kind of \"statement\" album.  The band was growing up and their songs and sound, already incredible, were becoming more mature and evolving.  The comparisions to the Beatles have always been uncalled for in my opinion as I have always felt that the brothers had a sound and style of writing that was uniquely theirs.\n\nBarry & Robin Gibb, in my opinion, were every bit the writers as Lennon\/McCartney or Townshend\/Entwhistle and this album is proof of how intricate and diverse their songs could be.  The epic title track shows their strong ability to \"story tell\" as they take us on a journey across the atlantic ocean.  Then you have songs with a country fell such as \"Marley Purt Drive\" to the folk sounding \"Melody Fair\" to the bouncy \"Suddenly\" amongst others.  Maurice Gibbs wonderful talent for writing melodies and being able to play multiple instruments really comes through strong as well.\n\nThis album really showed that the \"boys\" were growing up musically, at the time of its release, Barry was 22 and Robin and Maurice 19.  Unfortunately, after the release of this album, problems arose to the point that Robin left the band and the next album was recorded without him.  Fortunately for us, their fans, he would return after a brief hiatus and they would then begin the second phase of their incredible careers.  That being said, Odessa was truly the Crown Jewel of the early phase of their careers and a wonderful album, fresh and clean, all these years later.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Bobby Hebb was a black singer\/songwriter\/multi-instrumentalist born in Nashville in 1938. Bobby had the distinction of being featured at the Grand Ole Opry at the age of 12 in 1950. In June 1966 Philips records released a tune that Bobby had written called \"Sunny\". It became an immediate smash hit. Within just a couple of months Bobby Hebb found himself as the opening act for both The Yardbirds and The Beatles. Sunny electrified audiences in 1966 when Bobby Hebb toured with The Beatles bringing to that series of shows a hit as powerful as anything written or recorded by the Fab Four..\n\nDuring that 1966 Beatles tour Bobby Hebb garnered almost as much appreciation from the audience as The Beatles. With the opening guitar twang\/strum that preceded Hebbs voice, and with Bobbys authoritative pitch singing the magic word Sunny, waves of applause and shrieks of approval cascaded on whichever stadium or concert hall these artists appeared at. Yet, as is so often the case, fame was fleeting for Bobby Hebb. His follow-up record \"A Satisfied Mind\" barely cracked the Top 40 nationally and for all intents and purposes he was never heard from again.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"So, I both love and hate this song.  First, I love the moody music and the singer's voice.  And even though I hate them, I also love the lyrics.  If I seem conflicted, it's because it's a sexy, fun song...until you really listen to the words.  The singer of this song is saying, \"I've got a girl crush\" but really, what she has is incredibly low self-esteem and wishes she were another girl because she thinks she's in love with that girl's boyfriend.  I mean, really think about that.  Instead of this woman saying to herself, this guy likes \"long blond hair\" and \"[her] smile and the midnight laugh\" she might as well be saying, \"I hate my short, brown hair, I hate my crooked teeth, I hate my high-pitched voice.\"  It's a song about self-hate and wanting to erase who you are to be that someone else that some guy likes.  That is a terrible message for girls, and any woman to internalize.\n\nAnd then, there's the whole stalker-y aspect of the song:  \"Thinkin' about her under your bed sheets\"  and \"I wanna taste her lips, yeah, 'cause they taste like you\" and then the \"I want everything she has.\"  It's a little creepy - very \"Single White Female\" if you've seen that (terrible) movie.  Again, not really a message you want girls\/women to have.  You shouldn't want to be another woman, and you shouldn't obsess about or try to be another woman.  You should learn to love yourself, be comfortable with who you are, and look for men (or women, or both - whatever your preference) who appreciate and WANT you for that.\n\nSo, again, I love this song, it's my favorite workout cool down song, but would I want my children to listen to it?  Hells no.  Lest we think the lyrics don't matter, I would argue that all messages (music, TV, movies, video games, books, etc.) sink in and become a part of how our kids think and see the world.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"i might look at this album differently from most Soilwork listeners. I would say _Stabbing the Drama_ is a big improvement over _Natural Born Chaos_ and _Figure Number Five_, and it's sort of a medium between the two. Just for reference, _A Predator's Portrait_ is one of my all time favorite metal discs, simply perfect. _Steelbath Suicide_ and _Chainheart Machine_ are also fantastic. all three of those are brutal and furious. That said, I even liked FNF for the most part, because of the vocals and catchy songs, but the guitars and drums and METALNESS of it seemed more half-hearted IMO, a downgrade from _Natural Born Chaos_ but that album had its own shortcomings like sounding pretty homogeneous.\n\n_Stabbing the Drama_ has the same catchy aspect as these previous albums (NBC\/FNF) but the writing on the whole seems stronger. Heck, this band's songwriting is downright outstanding in my opinion, they write GREAT catchy metal songs, their melodic acumen is outstanding and Speed is an extremely empathetic vocalist. The album shows a tremendous refinement of the band's main direction for the last while, and if you take the last three albums as a class, this is the most well-rounded and best-written accomplishment of those. but here the songs have more variety and better quality from beginning to end (i haven't heard the newest one, _Sworn to a Great Divide_)\n\nI would honestly think of this has heavy pop music, which to me isn't a bad thing although such a description is probably a major turn-off to most people.  like pop music, the main focus is the vocals and the hooks. The general form of structure and arrangement is pretty straightforward, and by now Speed's approach to vocals is pretty predictable. Speed's voice is amazing though, whether the harsh voice or clean voice, and he's gotten much better with each album. That said, the music is much more... i dunno, fleshed out than the last few. Fat, chunky-choppy riffs and absolutely AMAZING drumming (forget Ranta, the new drummer is a fiend, did i mention that?), and very tasteful synths all drive the hooks home with amazing force behind the vocalist in the spotlight. pop music, even really good pop music, doesn't really show this kind of deadly chops.\n\nI'd say if you really _disliked_ everything since APP, STD won't change your mind -- BUT if you liked the general approach of the previous two albums but thought they could be a little better SOMEHOW, then you should pick this up if you haven't because it rules, although i wager the fan likes or would like NBC more than this one. I think this is just as addictive as those, but more well written so it has much better lasting power. i personally have deep regrets about not getting it until very recently.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I read an arcticle recently where the director was asked why he approached Daft Punk for the score, and he said \"how could you not go to those guys\". I agree, seems like the obvious choice. I've been a DP fan (not double penetration) since the moment I heard \"Around The World\", and this score is all I hoped for. Of course knowing it was a score I didn't expect a typical DP album like some of these 1 star morons. The music from TRON Legacy achieves what all the best scores should...it's takes you right back into the film. Just close your eyes, don the headphones and enjoy. Though \"Derezzed\" seemed to make it into all the trailers, there are a few other tracks with a driving beat and that heavy synth DP sound. \"End Of Line\" is very cool, as is \"The Grid\". \"Fall\" is quite dramatic, and \"TRON (end titles)\" kept me in the theatre longer than usual. 2\/3 of this score is indeed mood music, but it has emotion and is still well done. I think Daft Punk succeeded in balancing electronica and symphony about as well as they could have. Oh, and the complaints about the black disc...I've played it fine in my home system, car and pc.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"A first thought I had after listening to this was, does it deserve five stars for what it is, or four for what it isn't?  It does seem strange that a few years after their last studio album, they put out a live album from 2006, so obviously you won't hear anything from Down III.  Despite having no recent or new material, any Down fan would agree that live Down is awesome.  So I'll settle in the middle at four-and-a-half, plus Phil's voice is subpar at times.  I think he sounds adequate-to-great on most of the songs, but you get occasional moments like Jail, where he's not so good.  In between songs, you get trademark Anselmo goofiness and profanity, which is always amusing.  Anyway, listening to old Down songs takes me back in a good way, and the band sounds great on this.  Since they chose not to release a definitive live album, with more recent performances mixed in, I'm glad they did a CD\/DVD combo, so that you at least get both audio and video of the songs. I'm sure most Down fans will highly enjoy Diary of a Mad Band.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas might just be the very best Christmas song there is. Holistically Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is the song that best captures the essence of what Christmas should be right down to the title. Christmas doesn't have to extravagant but it should be happy,nice,peaceful,comfortable,and enjoyable. If it weren't for Frank Sinatra we wouldn't have the lyrics to this song we know and love today. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas originated in 1944 in a time period where many meaningful Christmas songs such as White Christmas and I'll Be Home for Christmas were emerging. The original version had somewhat different lyrics. The most notable difference is that the original version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas had a line that was sung. \"In a year we all we will be together if the fates allow. Until then we'll just have to muddle through somehow.\" Sinatra called songwriter Hugh Martin and told him \"I like your Christmas song\" but that he needed that line \"jollied up\" to include the piece on his Christmas album. Sinatra said \"The name of my Album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly that line up for me?\" And,of course,as Martin put it \"You don't say no to Frank Sinatra.\" The new lyrics in this line became \"Through the years we all will be together if the fates allow. Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.\" Frank Sinatra then became the artist to perform Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas with the improved lyrics. Frank Sinatra's Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is THE original version of Have Yourself a Merry Christmas and gets 5 out 5 stars hands down. :)","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Normally I find the one-sentence \"I liked it and that's all\" type of reviews to be an incredible waste of space on these Amazon product pages, but the truth is there really isn't much TO say about Christina Aguilera's latest offering, Lotus. It's definitely listenable as a whole, though none of the individual tracks really stand out as being too catchy or especially memorable on their own.\n\nThe album's first single, Your Body, has a good bouncy groove but is instantly forgettable and I doubt I'd be caught humming it to myself later. Other highlights include the rock-tinged Circles, just because I love a really good \"up yours\" type of song - but then who doesn't? lol - and Make the World Move with Cee-Lo Green is peppered with some fun lyrics and vocal effects. I wish I could give more praise to the ballads since I feel that's one thing Aguilera has always excelled at, but here she tends to just plain yell the words as opposed to sing them with any kind of melody or grace, and tracks like Blank Page come off as more of a jolting aural assault than a poignant tale of self reflection. She's been accused of over-singing since the beginning of her career, of course, but this is really the first time where I have felt like she's gone way overboard with it.\n\nStill, I'm hesitant to label this as a bad CD, even if the moments that reach beyond lukewarm level are few and far between. If anything, it just sounds as though Aguilera simply didn't have anything to say this time around and was only cranking out a low-key, \"safe\" album for the sake of meeting some sort of contractual obligation. Her last album, Bionic, disjointed as it was, contained a number of individual tracks that were well crafted in and of themselves, and her Back to Basics outing with its classical influences was a breath of fresh air in the industry at the time. None of that brand of creativity is really present on Lotus. No boundary pushing...no role playing...not even a set theme to play off of. \"Safe\" really is the best word I can use to describe it.\n\nDoes this mean her best days are behind her? I don't think so. If there's one thing I've always liked about her it's her ability to surprise, and let's face it, she's been a busy gal the last couple years anyway. Longtime supporters will certainly appreciate that we're getting something new at all, but casual fans may want to take a pass and just re-listen to some of her older material from when she truly emerged her full self into the music.","classification":3,"fold":1}

Some reviewers have stated that all the songs sound the same.  This is not true.  Certainly this album has a `sound'; a musical theme of sorts.  Listen to this album with headphones or ear buds.  It is sonically astonishing.  This CD also has a lyrical theme of the blues and of a long hard life.  The first song, `The Road', states\n\"Cause you put me on that pathway\nHow could I refuse\nAnd I have spent my whole life out here\nWorkin' on the blues\"\n\nThis is the theme the album follows and it works.

{"text":"\"One More Try\" was the fourth single and third straight to hit number one from George Michael's Faith album.  The song has an old-school r&b sound with Mr. Michael letting his soul roots shine in full display.  He rips through the song with deep emotion and fiery passion. The backing track has an airy, gospel sound that captures the confusion and hurt the singer is conveying through his many past broken relationships. The song pulled the rare trick of hitting number one on the pop, adult contemporary and r&b singles charts.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"The follow up to her wildly addictive debut White Sugar this album by British blues rock guitarist Joanne Shaw Taylor does a number of things. Firstly it expands her repertoire considerably and presumably her live shows will be able to be more fleshed out. Secondly this album has her showing a bit more restraint in terms of the guitar solos and she also uses more of a whispering vocal style in parts which is different if not actually a good thing.\n\nObviously when you come out of the blocks with a debut as good as Ms Taylor did the follow up won't hit people as hard and this album doesn't. But it has a danker feel of grit to it than the aforementioned debut and that isn't a bad thing. Issues arise however with the whispering vocals that fade into obscurity at times, songs that just don't sparkle like those of the debut and the guitar tones sought here seem obtusely thicker without necessarily obtaining extra gravitas as part of the deal.\n\nHighlights on this album would have to be the slow starting first track, Can't Keep Living Like This, Dead and Gone and the title track. Dead and Gone in particular sounds like it would be out of place on the first tune with the guitar and vocal riding a melody that is both plaintive and upbeat at the same time with a tasty fade out solo.","classification":4,"fold":1}

Which has always been part of the charm for me, but simultaneously when he's gone too far off a tangent, I get turned off.  Overall this album walked on that razor's edge for me from start to finish.  There are absolute moments of brilliance and some really original musical ideas, but some of those ideas went a bit too far and wandered into the \"just noise\" realm.\n\nIt wasn't nearly as easy to listen to as the \"Everything That Happens Will Happen Today\" album with Brain Eno, but I think the more I listen to this one, the more I will enjoy it.

{"text":"Written before Daughtry left for American Idol semi-superstardom, this song was also used for the actual show, and made for the best goodbye song yet. Although the song has lost a little of its luster after going through the ugly radio cycle, the song still remains as good as ever with its touching lyrics, perfect vocals, great structure, and its build-up during the course of the song. In fact, the only thing that could top this song, is its acoustic version, which I believe was distributed by Wal-Mart. It perfects the song in amazing ways, and makes the song a real stunner with new depths of emotion. That version was quickly added to my long list of best songs of all time.\n\nSo overall, Daughtry's best song, and it deserves all its praise. Try to get the acoustic version if you can, but either way, its a great song that'll always be remembered for American Idol.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":1}

I did not realize they had ended their romantic relationship, and I'm sad about that, but it imparts a bitterwseet air to their performance.  Hopefully they will continue their musical association for years to come, because they are only getting better.  This CD showcases Irglova's lovely voice in a couple of numbers.  I feel like Hansard is such a huge personality, and I like the idea that he has a softer side and uses Irglova to send that message.  I agree with the reviewer who points out that Hansard's voice is not so raw as on earlier albums.  In general the orchestration is more prominent and beautifully offsets their vocals.  The lyrics are clever and rueful.  I like this CD quite a bit.

{"text":"My Chemical Romance goes the Sgt Pepper's route on \"Danger Days,\" where they record an album in the guise of another band. In MCR's case, it's \"The Fabulous Killjoys,\" set in some sort of future where these rockers are rebels trying to save the world from...well...something. Not that it matters, as Gerard Way paints a great big, noisy picture of a comic book world where Glam Rock rules, Queen is King and David Bowie is a major prophet.\n\nNowhere is that truer than \"Danger Day's\" initial single, \"Na Na Na.\" Built entirely around the hook, it just plunges into amphetamine hyper-speed and doesn't let up. There's no way to avoid just how catchy the darn thing is; it's like Bowie's \"Jean Genie\" switched from 45 to 78 RPM. There's plenty of heroic chants (\"Sing,\" \"Planetary\"), anthems for saving the girl (\"The Only Hope for Me Is You,\" \"The Kids From Yesterday\") and soaring choruses all over the place. The story - as it is - gets tied together with vignettes by DJ Dr Deathray in pure comic-book fashion.\n\nWhile the concept doesn't really gel, the music is still super. There isn't anything as Queenly regal as \"The Black Parade's\" title song, but then, nothing on that album compared to \"Stone Cold Crazy\" like \"Na Na Na\" does. Way still has a way with a phrase, and little couplets like \"I've got a bullet-proof heart, you've got a hollow-point smile\" pierce out from the music. Also, this album starts to poke into U2 territory with \"Sing\" and \"The Kids From Yesterday\"; that's never a bad place to look for inspiration. \"Danger Days\" shows that My Chemical Romance aren't afraid to tweak the formula that's made them stars.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Prime Cuts: Northern Girl, Smile, The One\n\nPain and suffering have the ability to make poets out of us.  Over the last few years, Clark has had her share of tragedies: from the death of her mother to cancer in 2010, the drying up of her hits, the ensuing loss of her recording contract and her second divorce.  Yet the pinch of life has not sanitised her in anyway.  Rather, her trails had made her a keener observer of life and this is well reflected on her new album, of which she co-wrote 9 out of the 10 cuts.  Relative to her other 7 albums, \"Roots and Wings\" is more balanced and mature collection.  While Clark tries to emulate the tough and witty chic persona in her earlier hits such as \"Better Things to Do, \"Girls Lie Too\" and \"You're Easy on the Eye,\" this time round she does mix in songs that deal with issues that has to do with the heart.  Stylistically, this album is far more adventurous and more encompassing.  While Clark used to major on the rousing barn burners, this time around she has expanded her palette to include an old fashioned country tune (\"Lonesome Last's Call\"), a rock tune (\"We're Here for a Good Time\") and a Kate Wolf type of folk (\"Flowers in the Snow\").\n\nIt is not serendipitous that this album is titled \"Roots and Wings.\"  Clark has indeed returned to her Canadian roots with the lead single \"Northern Girl.\"  While country music has copious songs extolling the Southern states of America, it is a jolt to hear of Clark singing jubilantly about driving on black ice, tunneling through snow and trying to survive the frigid Canadian winters.  Another paean of Canadian origin is Clark's take of Troop's 1977 hit \"We Are Here for a Good Time.\"  As the title suggests this is a feel good number that would make for a great soundtrack for a joy ride.  Not only has Clark chosen to sing about the land north of the 49th Parallel, she has also collaborated with fellow Canadians such as Victoria Banks and Deric Ruttan.  Banks co-wrote with Clark and Tia Sillers the average sounding rocking radio-tailored \"Wrecking Ball\" which tells of the story of a missions-centered woman.  While Ruttan co-wrote with Clark and Sillers the much better \"The Good Was Great.\" \"The Good Was Great\" is a matured look at a relationship whereby it teaches us to look to the positive sides rather than tooth picked through the bad.\n\nAs with the other side of the album's title, Clark has also spread her wings to soar into uncharted territories.  \"Lonesome's Last Call,\" a track Clark wrote with Jim Rushing when she was only 22 years old is something you never expect from Clark.  A track that sits more comfortably on Patty Loveless' Mountain Soul albums, this is a track that intones with a foreboding ache about people who tether on romance's ending line.  \"Smile,\" which features some haunting vocals from Alison Krauss, is Clark at her vulnerable best.  Wrapping her mellifluous contralto around this tender tribute to her late mother, this ballad is enough to push us over to tearsville.  Again, Clark pushes the envelope with the plaintive \"Flowers in the Snow,\" a poetic adieu to a love that has died, which has a folky Kate Wolf vibe.\n\nPerhaps most autobiographical is \"The One\" where Clark advises all single gals to find a \"love you can't live without\" rather than just settling.  What is noteworthy about \"The One\" is that it finds Clark teaming up with songwriter Tom Shapiro again.  Shapiro is not only a top tiered country writer but he was crafting many of Clark's earlier hits.  \"Roots and Wings\" is a balanced effort finding Clark finally at home singing about her roots.  Yet, it is not too comfortable for Clark as she soars to new heights with her explorative wings.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"When it has came down to Jamie Foxx, his acting has really been going places. But, his music has been sidelined into sour grapes. It has been very hard for him to top what he had last year with Blame It as one of the party anthems of 2009. His latest single seems though a bit less to swallow for his longtime fans. Fall For Your Type, the lead single from his 4th album Best Night Of My Life, isn't really a driven soul song. The feeling of the song is trying to re-ignite more of a darker tone into a ballad, but yet at times the song doesn't bring out what Jamie had been known for with music. Maybe he should re-consider going back into stand-up comedy, until he comes up with some better harmonies. Hopefully, Jamie will fall right back into place then.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"First off, the packaging...in a lovely, luxurious red velvet BOX, not a slipcase as I originally thought it would be...with the title gold embossed.  Open it up and the treasures flow out...first a round red Bee Gees sticker, then a huge poster (double-sided), then a great photo-packed booklet (love the B&W cover, and Robin's buggish sunglasses...he looked downright alien-ish...a precurser to Flaming Lips head genius Wayne Coyne!!)...with incredible, informative liner notes that said what we've always known...prior CD issues were crap (abridged, bad sound, etc) and this was an opportunity to give \"Odessa\" the full glory treatment, and info on EVERY song...all versions.\n\nNow, the songs, oh man, THE SONGS!!!!  There are 3 CDs (as I guessed it would be when I first heard of this deluxe (an understatement if there ever was one) release...CD1 is the 17-track album in stereo, CD2 is the album in MONO (first time released in the US) and CD3 is the REAL treat, the 23-track \"Sketches For Odessa\"...cool and fascinating demos, alternate takes (sometimes both), 2 UNRELEASED tracks and a promo spot for the album from some record stores, not the radio.\n\nI won't go into the riches of the songs TOO much, but the lovely folks at Reprise\/Rhino must have known about how grand this album is (possibly the Bee Gees' best album ever, a true masterpiece) and how crap prior issues were, so they pulled out all the stops and made this clearly the best-sounding CD version of the album.  I don't know what is better, the stereo or the mono...they both sound great.  I love the songs on \"Odessa\", exquisite orchestral pop with killer melodies & 3-part harmonies and excursions into alt-country\/rootsrock a la The Band, and orchestral interludes...it works best playing from beginning to end as one piece, yet each track coulda worked as a killer single (except the 3 instrumentals of course).  Faves are def \"Melody Fair\", \"Marley Purt Drive\", \"Give Your Best\", \"Never Say Never Again\" (ESPESH the CD3 alt version with the fuzz guitar, AWESOME, it rocks a la Jesus & Mary Chain!!!), \"I Laugh In Your Face\", the awesomely cool Maurice-led \"Suddenly\"...on and on, one of THE great pop\/powerpop albums EVER made, and that's an understatement...\n\nNow, the REAL treats are the TWO unreleased tracks, \"Nobody's Someone\" & \"Pity\"...those songs are AMAZING, and it's wild to know they were in the vaults for 40 YEARS!!!!!!!!!!  They could have been hit singles easily, they sound finished and complete, with great hooks and harmonies, just killer.  Another thing is the album was not done justice by the choice of single released, \"First Of May\"...nothing against the song, it's lovely, but it would NOT have been my first choice of first single...\"Melody Fair\" or \"Marley Purt Drive\" or the title track would have caught people's attention, and the album would have done better, not widely forgotten except for collectors, hardcore fans and powerpop freaks...\n\nNOW, with this GRAND 3CD reissue, people will realize what they truly missed, the treasures in store for them.\n\nSo far, best reissue of 2009...nothing will top this.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"In the years after the breakup of Led Zeppelin Robert Plant made a few solo efforts, but they were hit and miss. Cheesy 80's FM Radio embraced ANYTHING Plant (or Page) tossed into their dogbowls. Then , in 1988, Robert Plant (with Page on this track) released the incredible return to form , \"Now and Zen.\" The zany FM stations praised it as the Second Coming but it was just a finely crafted, (and clever wink) to the music industry. Plant had nothing to prove to anyone (He has always been ' the tall cool one') and having his friend Jimmy Page sample a few classic Zep riffs, Plant scored big with this one. Perfect tempo, pitch, and catchy tracks made this album his most successful in years. 'Heaven Knows' is one of the best tracks, but check out the wistful 'Ship of Fools' and the bonus track, \"Walking Towards Paradise\" is a hidden gem. Not sure why the record company decided to leave it off the original LP. This marked the Return of the mighty and legendary Robert Plant , playing it fast and loose.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Word of mouth and buzz helped make \"Menopause\" a sleeper stage hit with middle-aged women.  This CD is mainly sold at the theatres that book the show on the nights they're on in the lobby.  This is the original cast (the usual case in this kind of release), so the end result can be different than of the actresses on the leg that perform in your area.  Don't expect a bunch of female Weird Als or \"Capitol Steps\"\/\"SNL\"\/\"Mad TV\" types.  The instrumentation is slightly amateurish, low budget, and weak.  For \"My Husband Sleeps Tonight\", a parody of the cringey oldie \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\", no credit is given to Solomon Linda, whose family fought for his recognition and residuals.  Some parodies keep the same titles as the songs they lampoon, like Tina Turner's comeback \"What's Love Got to Do with It?\".  That almost defeats the purpose.\nMost men and younger women may not relate to the lyrics that Jeanie Linders wrote from experience.  They refer to symptoms like hot flashes, ageing, night sweats, cramps, insomnia, mood swings, restlessness, binge eating, testy temper, becoming like their mothers; you name it!  Then again, maybe some things we all might get!  Because of the adult nature of these songs, I wouldn't play them around small children.\nFor the UK edition, Iowa Housewife becomes Rutland Housewife (Rutland could refer to Eric Idle's \"Rutland Weekend Television\", which makes some sense here), and the ladies meet at Mohamed Al-Fayed's world famous department store Harrod's instead of New York City's Bloomingdale's, and there are other regional variations around the world in contrast to the America-centric flagship.  Hopefully, they'll all release their own editions.\nThere have been two annual sold-out residencies to date in my town (and maybe yours as well), and it's always a rave.  Going to the show can't always be immortalised onto a studio recording.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Elton John's star was beginning to dim when he released A Single Man in 1978.  The album is a decent effort, but doesn't match up to his quintessential early 70's albums.  One big reason is that he severed his writing partnership with Bernie Taupin.  Together they created unforgettable songs, but apart, they've been hit and miss.  A Single Man falls into the hit and miss category.  Songs like \"Shine On Through\", \"Ego\", \"Part-Time Lover\" and the gorgeous and heartfelt \"Song For Guy\" (a tribute to his young messenger who was killed in a motorcycle accident) are quite good while others like \"Big Dipper\", \"Georgia\", \"Madness\" & \"Reverie\" fall short of the mark","classification":3,"fold":1}

As for Leona Lewis, I am very impressed with the depth of not just her voice, but the songs that she has shown with style and heart. They really don't feel like they are overexposed. Her second single, Better In Time, from her debut album Spirit, really isn't a bad song. The feeling here is a bit more somber with heart, unlike Bleeding In Love, but the song really sounds very well handed. I hope Leona keeps that songstress style coming, she really is the best thing out there right now, and that is better with time.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":1}

Sometimes, Johnny gets a little mellow on some cuts given the maturity and adult romantic feel of the songs. I still love the gorgeous Let's Get the Mood Right. It makes for good music to hear in the bedroom late at night.  Other favorites are Touch, Maybe and Having Illusions. I love the sexy It's Your Body and the late Roger Troutman of Zapp being on it. One of Roger's best of his final performances when he was alive. It still surprises me that he would follow the somewhat uneven Provocative with this well sung, well performed effort.  Staying true to himself and his vocal style is what makes his third Motown album my second favorite album by him.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"It had been some years by this point since Stanley Clarke had done a studio album under his own name. Looking to embrace the flavors of both his fusion years and modern smooth jazz Stanley,for the most finds a good balance between the two. After a lot of smooth jazz does need a stronger musical element to keep it from sounding muzaky. Interesting enough there is a concentration here,both literally and figuratively on Stanley's soundtrack work as the excellent slow jazz-funk groove of \"Justice's Groove\" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Poetic-Justice\/dp\/0767821955\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Poetic Justice<\/a>&nbsp;and the mellow \"Theme From Boyz N The Hood\". It's Stanley's bass by the way that keeps the song from becomming boring after a time. \"Fantasy Love\" tries to do a Howard Hewett duet-type song again in the spirit of \"Heaven Sent You\" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Time-Exposure\/dp\/B0000025V9\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Time Exposure<\/a>&nbsp;a decade earlier but,in my opinion doesn't suceed quite as well because there's little to no groove to the song really and it does tend to be somewhat over produced. Much better are \"Zabadoobeede? (Yabadoobeeda!)\" and \"I'm Home Africa\" which create a potent,dancable mix of jazz-funk and the percussive sounds of the motherland;holding true to an afrocentric element that,while well explored during Stanley's musical peak he had somehow neglected to fully embrace at that time. Well better late than never and it all works very well. The title cut is a good song with a decent groove to it but it brings to mind another unfortunate element of this album,one that is present on the movie themes as well. The sax solos by George Howard and Gerald Albright are very weak,even for smooth jazz quality and that is the reason I deduct one star from this otherwise really fine quality album. \"Christmas In Rio\" is actually really nice and breezy considering how much deep bass playing there is on it with a nice \"heavy on easy\" quality. \"What If I Forget The Champagne\" and \"Never Lose Your Heart\/There Lies The Passion\" are instrumentals that focus and as with \"Christmas In Rio\" there is some fine solos from guests Andy Summers,Jean Luck Ponty and Kenny Kirkland. There is a Sting element to these songs and,considering his recent work with Stewart Copeland in Animal Logic that was actually very appropriate. On \"Illegal\" and \"Lord Of The Low Frequencies\" Stanley gets a chance to focus on what he does best-bass playing and delivers some of his finest work in that arena on these stripped down,somewhat afro-funk type jams. George Duke shows up for the foot stomping flat out funk closer \"Funk Is It's Own Reward\";for the 70's funk fan this will likely be one of the more appealing. With the exception of the afformentioned weak sax playing on a couple of the tracks this album was actually one of Stanley's better comeback recordings and comes highly recommended.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"The Good\n\nThere's not much to say about this release really. For the most part Springfield stays true to the original arrangements of the songs, albeit for a different guitar or piano tone here and there. With the songs I recognize, \"I'm Not in Love,\" \"Life in a Northern Town,\" \"Broken Wings,\" \"Baker Street,\" \"Waiting for a Girl Like You,\" \"For No On,\" and \"Imagine,\" they sound just like the originals versions, except their being sung by Rick Springfield. All of the tracks chosen are mellow and flow nicely together. Rick is in great voice, but doesn't really challenge himself.\n\nThe Bad\n\nIt doesn't really make sense to include a new song (\"Cry\") on a covers album, but at least it fits in with the rest. I would have liked to have heard a couple of slightly different versions or arrangements.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nI know I've been a little critical of this album, but overall I like it. They're songs I know, from an artist I enjoy. The best thing about Rick Springfield staying true to the originals is that there's no room to mess them up, which happens sometimes with covers albums.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"What turned out to be Volume I of a series (3 so far) of chamber music boxes from the Bach Guild concentrates on the Romantics and late 19th Century nationalists.  We have Schubert, Brahms (the 3 Piano Quartets), Dvorak, Borodin & Bruckner, the last represented by his rarely heard String Quintet.\n\nSome of the Schubert (e.g., \"Death & the Maiden\") are the same performances that were issued in the Schubert Box several years ago but I find the Schubert String Quintet here, as performed by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, markedly superior to the one in the Big Schubert Box which, in any event, now costs $9.49, not 99 cents.  Similarly, the Brahms Piano Quartets were also included in the Big Brahms Box of 2012.  Still, when there's this much music of this quality, I don't mind a few duplications.\n\nBetween the three chamber Big Boxes and some of the composer specific boxes, we have a pretty good survey of chamber music from Haydn to Berg but there are still some gaps.  Where are the Brahms String Quartets, or quartets by Mendelssohn, anything by Franck or Faure, or the Schumann Piano Quartet or Piano Quintet.  How about it, Bach Guild?","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Bruno Mars has, almost overnight, become pretty recognizable in the music industry.  He's like the male equivalent of Nicki Minaj.  If you want a slick vocal to lace your chorus lines, you call Mars (just like if you want a catchy female rapper to spice up your remix you call Minaj).\n\n`Doo-Wops & Hooligans' marks Mars' solo effort.\n\nThere is no denying that Bruno Mars has a beautifully toned voice.  His vocals are crisp and smooth and delightful to listen to.  From the show he made with select radio singles, Mars wet our appetite and got us hooked with his hooks.  We wanted to hear more.  Sadly, this debut album doesn't really deliver 100 percent.  In fact, it leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nIt's kind of mediocre.\n\nIn a nutshell, I still love `Just The Way You Are'; it's a beautiful yet simple take on love and I fell for it immediately.  `Grenade' almost feels like the dark side to the first single.  The construction is similar, just more intense.  I like the song, although I must admit that the lyrical content on the chorus can be a tad obvious, which I'm not really a fan of.  It's like `lyrics 101'; very amateur writing.  His conviction though, is very convincing.  `Count on Me' sounds like a Jason Mraz song.  It has a bouncy and catchy vibe.  It's a little cheesy in parts (well, almost all parts) but it will get you swaying to the beat and it's a sweet song.  I know that `Marry Me' is all sorts of ridiculous cheesiness, but I totally adore it.  Maybe it has something to do with the whole `Glee' take on it last week, but I just swallow that track up with nothing short of wholehearted affections.\n\n`Talking to the Moon' is a sweet ballad, but it lacks any real punch to make it wholly memorable.  His voice sounds great, but it doesn't `pop' aesthetically.  `The Lazy Song' is just stupid.  It isn't really funny or witty; it's just lazy and amateur.  I mean, aside from the sexual connotation, it seems like a children's song, like commercialized Smash Mouth.  To say I hate the song would be an understatement.  `Runaway Baby' is fun and stands out because of the audaciousness of it all.  It has a spunky and vibrant vibe, so I thoroughly enjoy it, even if the lyrics seem contradictory.\n\nI know `Our First Time' is supposed to be seductive and sexy but it's rather bland and boring.\n\nThe vampire craze hit Mars, so he closed his album with `The Other Side' where he enlists the help of `it-man' Cee-Lo Green and that mediocre flash in the pan known as B.o. B. to help him spit a few verses about convincing some chick to convert to vampirism.  Um, it's a decent track when all is said and done.  It's catchy and stylish, but there is something missing from it.  `Liquor Store Blues' is just weird.  I mean, reggae is not something you just `mess' with.\n\nIt just doesn't work.\n\nSo, in the end the album is just kind of `meh'.  I mean, I like some of the songs and then I actually love two or three of them, but overall the feeling I get is one of being increasingly under-whelmed, so I can't say that I really recommend this album as a whole.\n\nDownload `Marry Me' and `Just The Way You Are'.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"\"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\" by the Proclaimers is about as high energy as a pop song can be. Positive lyrics, intense beat, great singing and musicianship help keep this song on my running playlist workout after workout.\n\nScottish identical twins, Charlie and Craig Reid -- these two brothers harmonize and sing off of each other well. Though only a modest hit in America, hitting #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1988, it lives on as a stadium anthem in Scotland, and in pubs everywhere.\n\nIt is a schmaltzy love song with a catchy refrain. If that's OK with you, give it a listen.\n\n\"And when I come home(When I come home), yes I know I'm gonna be\nI'm gonna be the man who comes back home with you.\"\n\nJust thinking about this song, I want to go for a run.\n\nAnthony Trendl\namericanspeechwriter.com","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"You have to love Tribe\/Q-Tip fans.  While I respect their opinions and appreciate their vigorous support of Tip, I have to tell the folks looking for objective opinions that some of these reviews are way over the top -- and this is coming from a 32 year old Tribe fanatic.  All that being said, there is still an abundance of dopeness to be found throughout the album.  \"Gettin' Up\" is a feel good piece that Tip issued as one of his first singles for the album -- and deservedly so.  The J-Dilla produced \"Move\" is another (internet?) single that's quite funky.  I found it hard not to nod while that track was playin'.  There are a bunch more --  like \"Dance On Glass\", \"Believe\", or \"We Fight\/We Love\", for example -- that make this album more than worthy of your dollars.  There will be very, very little disappointment should you decide to cop this album.\n\nThere are no tracks on the album that I would label as wack, but there is some forgettable material to be found.  Like, even though I do dig \"Won't Trade\", I skip it more often than not.  I would put \"Official\" in the same category.  Again, there's nothing technically wrong with these songs, and they are good, they just didn't hit in the chest like Tip's music usually does...if that makes any sense.  lol  Really, though, those are the only two joints I would label as skip material.  The rest is very nicely put together.\n\nThe Renaissance is LP worthy of (most of) the praise it receives.  A lot of these reviews are a little over the top -- classic talk is a bit premature and undeserved as of yet, and you have to give Tribe fans credit for being fiercely loyal, but, come on...  The production is dope and Tip is still capable of putting together a rock solid LP; which ain't half bad bad for a 38 year old has been (according to todays fickle standards).  Youngsters should take note, though they probably won't.  Chances are, though, that if you're looking into this album, you already know the man's pedigree.  Let me tell ya, he comes through this time around.  I recommend adding this one to your music library.\n\nStandout Tracks: Believe feat. D'Angelo, We Fight\/We Love feat.

{"text":"While some of these songs may sound like tunes from his past cd's, don't get it twisted...Tank is definitely on his grind and game!  A very sexual, yet romantic piece of work, he consistanly puts out material that it aimed at the grown and sexy, not the young and juvenile.  If you can handle some explicit lyrics defining some situations, then this is the one for you. I think he hit a mark with this recording that was slightly missed on his last, NOW OR NEVER.  His voice is on the money and each and every song was tailor-made for him.  Now, I must admit, if this cd was recorded by MINDLESS BEHAVIOR, or any other group with 3 to 5 members who were all under the age of 18, who didn't have one member who could sing bass, but they could all thrust those pelvic areas on beat, who all had allergic reactions to wearing shirts, pants that were 5 too 10 sizes to big and each always wore different facial expressions, this would have been blockbuster out of the park.  This is why we need artist like Tank, so that mindful adults, like me, can appreciate what's missing in R&B music today.  WAY TO GO, TANK!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"It took about 3 years, but Monica is finally back with a new album that's a fresh and welcome release in today's stale \"been there, done that\" music scene. I watched bits of her BET reality show from time to time and couldn't wait for the new material. I'm happy to say Miss Thang did not disappoint. A few misses here and there, but a solid record overall.\n\nThe title track and theme song of the reality show details the struggles Monica's been through and how she's used the pain to keep her going. \"I been up against ropes\/Everything you're going through\/I been there before, seen them all come\/And I seen them all go\/You can bet your last that\/My head won't hit the floor, never\/And I'm still standing!\" Love the rap from Ludacris (did you know Monica's his cousin?), although I don't care for the generic hip-hop background much.\n\nThe lush Once In A Lifetime is a realization that the one you walked away from was \"the one\". \"And I can't believe that I almost missed the signs\/Right in front of my eyes\/And now I know the love is real, its hard to say why.\" Stay Or Go is the ultimatum given to a wishy washy boyfriend that's worked Miss Thang's nerve for the last time. \"So let me know\/Whatcha gonna do\/Stay or go\/Cuz I'm not waiting\/Boy, yes or no\/I'm about to decide for you\/Stay or go!\"\n\nLead single Everything To Me marvels at and luxuriates in the love of a good man with starry-eyed lyrics like \"You're everything to me\/The air that I breathe\/Sign so I'll see, oh Lord\/You're everything to me!\" The Deniece Williams sample is gorgeous! The funky 80's retro feel of If You Were My Man will make you break out the Cabbage Patch, Running Man, and Roger Rabbit. The Missy Elliott shout-outs might annoy some, but I like them. Monica's flow is nice too. \"See, baby, she can't love you like I do\/She just a chick tryna be like me\/You wanna go and hang around all them crazy fools\/Cuz in ya face she shake her booty\/See, baby, that's not I\/I'm a classy girl\/Guaranteed boy to rock ya world\/So let her go, let her go\/I'm just lettin' ya know\/I'm not a hoe call me your black pearl!\" *SNAP*\n\nIt took me a while to warm up to Mirror, but it's definitely grown on me. Although slightly weakened from a generic clubby production, Monica's vocals and the message of the song got me hooked. \"When I look at myself in the mirror\/I don't have to feel ashamed\/Now it couldn't be much clearer\/I'll never have to search again\/When I look at myself in the mirror\/I don't even recognize\/The girl all about the glitter\/Cuz now I sit by my side\/When I look at myself in the mirror.\"\n\nMonica's fluid vocals work it's magic with the hazy background of Here I Am. Fed up with a negligent boyfriend, Miss Thang lets a better guy know she's interested in getting with him. \"So why don't you come\/Pick me up and take me to the crib\/And do the things\/That I have told you he won't do?\/So now you know\/Baby boy, stop trippin'\/Cuz it is just me and you!\" Superman isn't as strong, but it's still enjoyable with sweet references to the fictional superhero. \"It's a bird, it's a plane\/It's Superman\/I can be your Lois Lane.\"\n\nThe glossy ballad Love All Over Me is absolutely stunning. Praising a new man for showing her that true love is real, Monica sings \"Took me by surprise when you ran up on me\/I came to life baby in that moment\/You put your hands on my heart and baby\/now it beats!\" Her voice gets a chance to soar without a trace of unnecessary melisma or runs. Excellent second single! The downtempo acoustic closer Believing In Me basks in the freedom gained after ending a painful relationship. \"And I'm glad that you're gone\/Cuz your not what I need\/I'm believing in me\/I've moved on\/And I'm strong\/Going back to the place where I know I belong\/Cuz I'm right and your wrong\/You were not what I need\/I'm finally believing in me!\"\n\nAs if the girl wasn't amazing already, she's done a great job with Still Standing. That voice of hers is even richer than before and that's a major plus! The album's strength is it's R&B\/Soul roots tied to the 80's and 90's. The golden age of music imo. Welcome back, Miss Thang! We missed you, girl.","classification":4,"fold":1}

Our theme song was to be \"Hotel California\" by The Eagles. However, we were told that our choice was too risque for our high school prom. We had to go back to the drawing board. Finally, our buddy James Taylor and \"Shower The People\" proved to be acceptable to our teachers and faculty. The real irony is that Taylor's lyric \"if it feels nice, don't think twice\" made it right past their censor noses. I chuckle about that to this day.

I guess the song for the show is OK but really? The rest of the material isn't what you would hear from any of these ladies (except possibly Monifah -- love her voice but I heard her first album too and some of her material is very middle of the road also). I like all of the singers here. Some of them are top of the crop R&B females. But the material is really drab. Very plain.\n\nAll in all I wouldn't recommend this collection as a whole to anyone.

Paula Cole's vocals on \"What'll I Do\" are also classic backdropped against Botti's tempting trumpet that plays for 2 minutes before she enters the arrangement.  Live, Botti's band blasted joyfully with Botti paying homage to his idol Miles Davis.  Ennio Morricone's \"Cinema Paradiso\" starts with Botti's moody trumpet before Billy Child's piano carries the melody.  Sting joins on \"La Belle Dame Sans Regrets\" after almost 3 minutes for another moody lyric sung in French.  \"One for My Baby\" is another soothing savvy excursion lifted by Chris' honey-drenched trumpet.  \"When I Fall In Love\" is a marvelous moody jazz set, one to put on play & let your daydreams run wild.

{"text":"If one has listened to and understood the brilliance of drummers like Art\nBlakey and Elvin Jones, it is hard to get excited by a drum machine, and\nalthough there are great musicians out there that sometimes use them successfully  (Beck and the Eels immediately spring to mind) most times they just sound synthetic.\n Chan Marshall has an amazingly rich, soulful,and dare I say organic voice and is a great songwriter, she has worked with some of the best musicians this country has to offer including some of Al Greens backup band, why on earth would she opt this time for a synthetic, cheesy, euro-disco\/trip-hop sounding record?\n  The Albums Moon Pix and You Are Free are masterfully spare, soulful and creative gems and although I would not want to stifle an artist's need to explore, this album seems to defy her very nature. Her voice and lyrics, her strengths, seem to get lost in the mix, the synthetic music does not support those strengths but overwhelms them. Perhaps she can opt for a costume of raw meat and make the transformation complete and get an interview on 60 minutes.\n  To me this is, tragically, a 2 star effort by a 5 star artist, but it is a 5\nstar disappointment.","classification":2,"fold":1}

{"text":"As the title might imply, this is a very mellow album that might send you to sleep if you are in any way tired. But if you were to fall asleep while this CD is playing, you'd miss some great music. The book from which Shawn selected these carols and lullabies obviously contains many songs that are rarely heard these days, making this particularly interesting for those looking for something different, though there one song here that is famous all around the world - Silent night, which works as a lullaby as well as a carol.\n\nThe opening track, In the bleak midwinter, is a wonderful old English carol and it's great to hear this sung by an American - a rare occurrence. Rocking is another old English carol, one that is particularly suited to this album, being both a holiday song and a lullaby. All through the night is a carol I've heard before but recordings of it seem to be even rarer than Rocking and In the bleak midwinter.\n\nElsewhere, there are beautiful songs such as Windy nights (words by Robert Louis Stevenson), All the pretty li'l horses, Little road to Bethlehem and Love came down at Christmas. The final track is Close your eyes, so it seems that Shawn really does want you to fall asleep after that.\n\nThis is definitely not a typical Christmas album but very soothing - and very satisfying.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Having released live albums in 1968 (\"At Folsom Prison\") and 1969 (\"At San Quentin\"), this previously unreleased 1969 live show from New York's Madison Square Garden still manages to illuminate another side of Cash's performance. Given the pressure of the prison shows, not to mention their tailor-made set lists, this recording finds Cash less on-edge, providing a more accurate rendering of his then-current stage show. Everyone but a very pregnant June Carter Cash is on-board, including the Tennessee Three (Marshall Grant, W.S. Holland and Bob Wooten), Carl Perkins, Tommy Cash, The Statler Brothers and The Carter Family (including Mother Maybelle, and daughters Helen and Anita).\n\nThe set list covers many of Cash's most beloved songs (including a quartet of prison tunes, and a barn-burning take of \"Wreck of the Old 97\"), plus a generous helping of historical and folk classics, including Jane Bowers \"Remember the Alamo\" (recorded throughout the '50s and '60s by The Kingston Trio, Donovan, Willie Nelson and others). He provides contemporary commentary about the Vietnam War (\"when you watch the helicopters bringing in the wounded, that might make you a dove with claws\") and sings Ed McCurdy's \"Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream\" (a standard of the '60s folk revival, sung by The Weavers, Chad Mitchell, and Simon & Garfunkel, among others).\n\nThe ease and confidence with which Cash presents himself on stage is astounding, and more in evidence than in the live prison recordings. Spoken introductions to songs like \"Five Feet High and Rising\" pull everything together into a seamless presentation. Similarly, Cash's generous revue staging allows his compatriots -- each headliners in their own right -- to shine brightly. Carl Perkin's blazes through \"Blue Suede Shoes,\" The Statler Brothers sing a lively version of their crossover hit \"Flowers on the Wall,\" and the Carter Family performs a beautiful pair of songs from A.P. Carter's catalog (\"Wildwood Flower\" \"Worried Man Blues\"). Cash's sister-in-law, Helen Carter, provides a wonderfully warm introduction to the Carter Family segment.\n\nThe closing medley provides each member of the troupe a chance to give their twist on a Cash landmark. Johnny and his brother Tommy sing \"Do What You Do, Do Well,\" The Carter Family sings \"I Walk the Line,\" The Statler Brothers take on \"Ring of Fire,\" and Carl Perkins finds the rockabilly heart of \"Folsom Prison Blues.\" Cash closes out the show with a snippet of \"The Rebel - Johnny Yuma,\" and yet another reprise of \"Folsom Prison Blues.\" The crowd's thunderous applause draws an encore of \"Suppertime.\"\n\nThis is a beautiful (and generous: 77 minute!) stereo recording of a stage master at the peak of his powers, singing and speaking to an enthusiastic sell-out crowd. It is at once incredibly intimate and incredibly grand. The only improvement would have been to release it 33 years ago!","classification":5,"fold":1}

It was reissued on an audiophile lp pressing a few years back though. These are fun takes on Mancini originals. Jones sure has a great imagination and is fun. The occasional track sounds dated using sound effects that was popular in the 60's, but on the whole, this album is really fun and is worth checking out. But the big minus is that they didn't reproduce the liner notes in a little booklet. It's reproduced on the cover and is really small. That is a shame since the notes are informative. Other than that, a fine reissue with top notch remastering!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"The year was 1960 and few boy groups - with the exception of the Lettermen - were successful. Names like Frankie Avalon, Bobby Vinton, and Bobby Rydel were considered the kings of youth music. But all of that was about to change. Before the Beach Boys, you had this foursome. The Four Seasons emerged that year 1960 with not one or two but several 45 hits. They dominated the top of the charts and took America by storm. First with \"Sherry\" quickly followed by \"Walk like a man\" and then \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" the Four Seasons brightened up sleep overs and slumber parties everywhere. Girls couldn't get enough. The 60's arrived big time in most part to the new sound coming from New Jersey and that sound would shape the decade to come. Solo acts would fall to the side. Groups would dominate.\n\nLater, when Frankie Vali stepped out in front of the group to bask in his own glory, the shine fell off the rose and the rising star of the Four Seasons began to fall. Vali tried to go solo only to find his voice lost in the Beatles\/Stones era of music, where it never really rose to its former heights. Vali's career ended by fading away into obscurity... until a little Broadway play came along four decades later.","classification":5,"fold":1}

Mellotrons and guitars sprinkle your ears with sparkling rainbow splatters of freaky-fun sounds riding on the  hallucinatory bass-thump of spotted unicorns in a twisted Disneyland.  Occasional flirtations with spastic noise and experimental ambience add a peculiar mystery to the mix.  Shades of 60s baroque folk and prog-pop rise up through the prismatic pastiche with fog-like, wispy, ghost-dancing images of Syd Barrett, the Beatles and Bubble Puppy.  On tour, the band is augmented by members from the Beastie Boys & the Fungi Band.  Monolith of Phobos is a creative bit of psych\/pop fun with a cool nostalgic edge, a strange and rewarding listen.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"There are really two songs on this disc that are not on the US version - 'You Take It All' and the Latin-flavoured 'The Look.' While this import may be a little expensive, 'The Look' is totally worth the extra cash. Unlike many of the other songs on this disc, 'The Look' does not contain a lot of computer enhanced effects, like the 100% techno number 'The Music's No Good Without You.' 'The Look' is set to a funky Flamenco beat that would have really gone over well as a single in the US. The lyrics may be light weight, but it's just so much fun to listen to! I don't pernsonally own the Japanese version of 'Living Proof,' but I have heard 'The Look' a number of times. If you love Cher and Spanish-influenced music, buy a copy of this import. I can assure everyone that they will not be disappointed.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Once again, Paul McCartney passes up the opportunity to create a truly expansive box set. Instead, he slaps together an unwieldy compilation of hits, misses and omissions titled \"Pure McCartney.\" There is little rhyme or reason to this collection. Sir Paul still cannot differentiate between the gems (\"Maybe I'm Amazed,\" \"Junior's Farm,\" \"The World Tonight\") and the occasional dross (\"Bip Bop,\" \"Temporary Secretary,\" \"Press\"). Despite some undeniably classic tracks, McCartney loyalists deserve a much better overview.","classification":3,"fold":1}
{"text":"\"600 Years in a Moment\" is the much-anticipated new release from Fiona Joy Hawkins. From the stunning cover artwork to the very last note of the music, this album could stand as Hawkins' magnum opus. Fiona told me last year that she felt that this was her best work to date. As much as I love Blue Dream, I would have to agree. The project was created as an answer to the question of musical \"globalisation\" with Hawkins performing on a hand-made Stuart and Sons piano (an Australian company that respects traditional piano building while embracing innovation) with an impressive list of supporting artists playing an assortment of ancient musical instruments from all over the world. Most of the twelve tracks are new music, but a few old favorites appear with new arrangements. The album was produced by the team of Will Ackerman, Corin Nelsen, and Hawkins, and was recorded and engineered by Nelsen at Imaginary Road Studios.\n\n\"600 Years in a Moment\" begins with \"600 Years,\" a piece that combines spoken word (Fiona), Gaelic vocals (Heather Rankin), and a fascinating combination of instruments that includes piano, Irish whistles, wooden flute, Spanish laud, electric guitar, bass guitar, Irish bodhran, and cello. The voices are ethereal yet earthy, as are the instruments. Calm yet magical, it sets the tone for the rest of the album. The languid and sensual \"Naked Love\" features piano, violin, Mongolian morin khuur, throat singing, Chinese bawu, Hopi drum, Romanian bells, obsidian chimes, and Japanese Kubota. Eclectic, no? \"The Journey,\" a favorite, includes Charlie Bisharat on violin as well as wordless vocals, Egyptian water bottle(!!!) and electric upright bass guitar. A bit more uptempo than the previous tracks, it expresses movement and anticipation. \"Earthbound\" is the only piano solo, and what a fluid, beautiful piece it is - I love the sound of that piano!!! The smooth and elegant \"Gliding\" has appeared previously, but the instrumentation is somewhat different on this recording - another beauty! The instrumentation becomes even more exotic on the sensuous \"Tango in Wednesday\": Hungarian tarogato, Turkish oud, Columbian tiple, African djun djun, tubano, doumbek, tam-tam, deer toenails(!!!),African cabasa, Tibetan tingsha bell, Middle Eastern riq, etc. I know what a few of those are, but only a few! As incongruous as the mix sounds, it's an incredible combination that works beautifully! \"Running On Joy\" has appeared before with slightly different titles, but this delightful burst of musical energy is always distinctive with the sound of the Australian didgeridoo. \"Flight of the Albatross\" appeared on Hawkins' second album and has gone through a variety of incarnations over the years. It's still one of my favorites and appears here as \"Ancient Albatross.\" The piano really sings on this one! \"Captured Freedom\" has a much simpler instrumentation with piano, violin, and Irish whistle - a rather unusual but very effective combination. The whistle really brings out feelings of longing - lovely! \"Forgiveness\" closes the album with a gentle but very evocative duet for Chinese bawu and piano - another unusual but very effective pairing.\n\nFiona Joy Hawkins makes it clear on \"600 Years In a Moment\" why she has become an artist with an international following. This album is available in several formats including CD, download, and audiophile-quality vinyl. Very highly recommended!","classification":5,"fold":1}

However, there's something about Ke$ha's persona that just makes the songs seem more fun.\n\nGive 'Blow' a listen. From the opening command to dance through the closing call of 'Blow!', the entire song is 80% Ke$ha chanting 'This place about to blow'. It's one of the most unoriginal songs she has put out and sure isn't going to win her any new fans. Yet those synths that form the backbone of the song paired with her impassioned delivery make this irresistible dance floor fodder. By the time the bridge kicks in and Ke$ha screams with incredible enthusiasm 'This place about to BLOW!', it's all a full-out dancing frenzy.\n\nKe$ha knows what she's good at, and doesn't differentiate much from that. Thankfully, she's not trying to be anything she's not (like a legitimate artist), and as long as she keeps making irresistible dance numbers, who are we to deny the party?","classification":4,"fold":1}

She has really wasted her own talents, and her own time in finding less than the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Unfortunately, the time that she made coming into her Anti album, was not even close to what she could've done. When I first heard her song Work with Drake, I really continued to recognize that was tired in her own voice, and felt choppy and cheap at the soul. Her second single from her Anti album continues to show that she is trying to be sexier in her sound, but she is not at all. Kiss It Better, tries to throwback into the sexy R&B sound of the 90's in seduction, but sad the seduction is not a sound that has hit very hard. I really didn't find this song to really show she was bigger in her sound, and just not showing that she could make better than before. Perhaps Rihanna should retire and walk away.

So for a completist like me, this was essential. Sinatra has never sung so tender with silky wave like patterns as he did when he recorded with Jobim. If you need to wonder why Sinatra was the GREATEST male pop singer to have ever walked the earth, this is a great example of his art. The song selelctions are all Bossa Nova classics, great arranging and great conducting all combine for a musically satisfying album. Now for the bad part. The remastering. Concord has been reissuing a lot of out of print Sinatra recordings for the past two years now. Their first album reissue, My Way, was done well. I was hoping that the other releases would be as good sonic wise. This would not be the case. Their follow up release, the Jobim recordings, shows just how bad the remastering is. Not only is the remastering poor, they used tapes that have flaws in the recording. This is strange since Larry Walsh has previously remastered other Sinatra recordings. I have purchased those and while there were no major improvements in sound, they didn't have any glaring problems either. Sadly that is not the case here. For \"The Girl from Ipanema\", Sinatra phrases the opening line differently, in which he does the entire first line in one breath. This is NOT the same take that has been issued in the past. Then Frank's voice cracks on the word \"day\". This must be a different take since the percussionist plays different notes at this part too. Why would you use a take that shows the artist in poor form??? What genius green lighted this?? Then there is the sound. God is it bad. They sucked out all the studio ambience and reduced the sound stage. The guitar intro for \"Girl\" originally had a wonderful, warm soundstage with a nice air of naturalness around it. Now, it sounds cold and thin. Sinatra's voice is dry, but close, since they removed all that nice studio reverberation. For Dindi, the original release had a wonderful concert hall sound to it, now it's completely dry. Then on Meditation, the bassist plays a wrong note toward the end fo the cut. For \"Corcovado\", the word \"my\" at the end of the song is phrased differently, indicating that this was a splice from another take. At least with the second half of this album, it isn't the odd takes that is in question, it's the sound stage. For Agua De Beber, Jobim was previously on the left, but Larry Walsh decided to move the entire rhythm section to the center. Gee, might as well make it mono. And they seem to reduced his volume and Jobim's vocals are harder to hear than in previous issues. For \"Triste\", the cymbal crashes in the bridge of the song would have a nice beautiful decay. Now when the crash comes, it hits and then just disappears suddenly. This is no doubt due to the fact that they removed all that nice reverberation. Terrible. Two great artists like this shouldn't be presented this way. If you are lucky enough to have the 20 bit reissue of Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim, do not even bother with this. The 20 bit has all the correct takes and is presented in the best sound that album has ever enjoyed. This one is AWFUL in comparison. So if you are an audiophile, please avoid this unless you are a completist.","classification":3,"fold":1}

This (\"VI\") is the first one made from tapes left behind and completed as an album by Rick Rubin.  The first two tracks alone (\"Ain't No Grave\" and \"Redemption Day\") are reason enough to buy this first posthumous compilation album of various leftover tracks for American Records.  The rest of the album does sound like a farewell to his life and to his fans.  For that reason alone the album ends up being a sobering (if not depressing) experience, however, it is still a brilliant performance.  Of course, this did not end up being the last of Johnny's American recordings as a large box set of unreleased tracks was put together after this album, but this CD is a very beautiful and fitting end (perhaps best played after the box set).

The haunting melodies and the powerful lyrics get under your skin and stick in your head.

Chris Botti's trumpet is lush and right on as far as pleasing the New Wave jazz crowd.  It's very romantic and makes a real nice backdrop to a much anticipated Valentine's Day Dinner.  And there's some real nice vocals by Paula Cole and Sting.  The songs are old standards and familiar but done with such aromatic flavor that it might sound new to some.  I like this CD very much for what it is and people who are hard core jazz fans shouldn't be too snooty and dismiss it as easy listening pop stuff.  Chris Botti has some real talent and with the abundance of sax out there, his trumpet is refreshing, but don't be in a hurry to compare him to Miles Davis yet, let alone Lee Morgan, nice music though, gets you in the romantic zone.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"How can you not know who 50 Cent is?  50 Cent has done something that hasn't been done in a while.  A COMPLETE DEEBO of the Industry.  Strategy or fate?  A little of both.  His controversial How To Rob garnered much attention.  Then consequently he was shot multiple times and survived through it all. (there's your street cred).  By this time, the bootleg of his supposes debut 'Power Of The Dollar' was hot on the streets and the internet.  Quickly following that, 50 gets dropped from a deal.  Later on he releases Guess Who's Back and again has the streets talking.  By this time his beef with Ja Rule & Murder Inc. is in full effect.  Somehow Eminem gets tapes of 50 Cent and they begin chitter chatter.  Then in an almost assassin like fashion 50 releases THREE mixtapes to the street featuring his crew G-Unit (50 Cent Is The Future, No Mercy No Fear, God's Plan).  Uh oh...now he has the streets on lock...only one more step.  50 Cent signs to Shady Records, features on the biggest hip hop movie soundtrack at the time (8 Mile) and releases his first single entitled \"Wanksta\" and grabs the media by the throat.  By the time everyones singing on Wanksta, Dr. Dre produces the hit \"IN Tha Club\", an instant club anthem, and has everybody EAGERLY anticipating the album.  The album soon follows and sells nearly 900, 000 copies the first week...topping Snoop Dogg's debut album record for most copies sold in the first week.  Hook, Line, sinker.\nNow about a month after the initial hype I have come to see this album as a modern classic.  It doesn't hold a candle to universal hip hop classics such as Doggystyle, Illmatic, or SouthernPlayalisticCadillacMuzik.  But the reason it's a classic is because 50 Cent's Get Rich Or Die Tryin has\/ will change the game.  And any album that can do that has to be considered a classic.  There are so many standouts on this album....\"Back Down\", What Up Gangsta, Many Men, In Da Club, Heat, High All The Time, 21 Questions....the whole album is bumpin.  There's no filler and I can definitely play this joint over and over straight through.  Hotness.  The beats are top notch, the lyrics are tight, the flows are on point (even with the slur; but keep in mind he was shot in the jaw\/mouth area), the guests don't bog down the album...Overall just a great album.\nJust trust me on this one...this cd is definitely a must have.  50 Cent is something special.  I don't know what it is but whatever it is 50 Cent definitely has it.  If he can stay alive...he will do many great things in hip hop.  Let's just hope his talent and controversial lyrics don't lead to another talent being lost.  5 stars!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"As a huge fan of The xx (including their underrated sophomore album \"Coexist\"), it's taken me awhile to warm up to Jamie xx. I wasn't a big fan of the remix collaboration he did with Gil Scott-Heron, and some of his other post-xx work hasn't really stuck with me. However, \"In Colour\" has me sold on Jamie xx as a solo artist.\n\nThis is a strong album with a little bit for every music fan. There's dance, rave, EDM, minimalist, electronic, pop, rap, jazz, and every other sub-genre in between. On this album, Jamie xx proves himself a master of blending genres without overdoing anything. He even gives some nods to The xx on a few tracks, which will surely excite fans of the band.\n\nThe album flows well together, whether the songs are big and bold or intimate and chill. It's the type of album that comes full circle and works great on repeat. It's probably an album best listened to on headphones, and you'd probably enjoy it more with the lights off. But you could also play it at a party and keep people on the dance floor.\n\nThe highlights of the album include \"Gosh,\" \"Loud Places,\" \"SeeSaw,\" and \"I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times).\" But there really aren't any duds on here. At times it may feel like Jamie xx is playing it too safe, but that's only to the untrained ear that isn't looking for the subtlety in this music. These songs are rich and have plenty to offer on repeat listens. There's plenty here that's catchy, and the album as a whole moves the soul.\n\nJamie xx has proven himself as a solo artist, not just a producer or remix artist. This is a colossal achievement for his proper debut, and I look forward to more Jamie xx in the future.","classification":5,"fold":1}

For all this album is, in the same light, it floats off into the clouds, is vague, and entirely too sweet for my liking.  What can I say, I need some edges on which to hang my hat ... so it wasn't until the song \"Papercut\" drifted from my speakers, that I had a sense that Tift Merritt actually had something to say, and in a manner that held my attention.  Believe me, it's fine for songs to be etherial, but they need to be memorable, otherwise this is just an album to slip off to on a Sunday morning when you're trying to shield your eyes from the sun as it creeps in through the blinds.\n\nOthers have compared Tift to Sheryl Crow, though she dances on the indy side of the scales.  I once heard Tift in an interview saying that she never really says what she means ... and folks I tell you, it shows.  Sure, this is a very intimate album, at least it was designed to be, it has a really nice opening track \"Mixtape,\" but for the most part See You On The Moon doesn't go anywhere, nor does it allow your imagination to take you anywhere, other then setting the stage for a reflective somber morning about life in general.  In another interview Tift said that she has always subscribed to the less is more attitude ... and that shows as well ... excluding the tracks \"Mixtape,\" and \"Papercut,\" where she subscribes to the more is better philosophy, and has something to say in an exciting manner, lifting the vail of obscurity, and revealing the two finest songs of her career.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","classification":3,"fold":1}

However, I am slightly disappointed in that the overwhelming majority of the tracks are merely instrumental and even more disappointed that what they call 18 tracks is far from what I expected. Many...most of these tracks are snippets of starts or parts of songs. Granted, they provide great anticipation when they start out but they stop before they ever develop into anything measurable. The production quality is superb as you would expect from these guys but I'm a bit disheartened. Possibly my expectations were just too lofty; that being said, Pink Floyd had never previously failed to meet and exceed my overly lofty expectations. In closing, it really pains me to post a review that says this collection is anything less than stellar but I think it truly had the opportunity to be so much more. However,, the more times I listen to it, the more redeeming it seems to get. (This is my 3rd re-write of this review and each re-write has spoken more highly of this effort.)","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Is this worth a purchase for the longtime fan? I pretty much had everything already, including most of the versions here. Once the tracklisting became available I went to my Amazon cloud, assembled a playlist with every track from this collection in sequence but for those which would only become legitimately available upon release. So the question became, \"What's in the package?\"\n\nI preordered the three CD version (why would you settle for anything less?). Upon its delivery on the day of release I popped open the box to find out. Amazon's images show what the box set looks like when its gatefold is fully extended. Two CDs are contained in one of those \"slimline\" twofer CD jewel cases, a third disk is in a second CD jewel case. The two CD jewel cases slide out from the two sides of the gatefold box; the matte finish cardboard case holds them snugly so they can be retrieved easily but without the likelihood of a case falling out if you hold the box vertically.\n\nEach of the two jewel cases contains a sixteen page booklet. The artwork and photography are beautiful as we've come to expect from any of Mr. Bowie's packages; roughly one page-sized photo for each of his decades. With a set like this spanning a full fifty years in the arts there's really no need to add pages to accommodate the musings of some itinerant journalist from this music rag or that. So if you find this music compelling it will be because of the testimony of your own ears and taste rather than liner notes containing the advocacy of some scribe-for-hire. The two booklets of sixteen pages each contain a tracklisting, songwriting credits, a namecheck for the album from which each track was drawn, and the legalese that goes with each track entry. Credits for musicians are listed only for the one new track, \"Sue\", which leads off the box set. So as packaging goes it's elegant and minimalist. Not in the bad sense; this attractive set bears no resemblance to the cheap catalog issues MCA put out in the 80s, for instance. But if you opt for the digital download instead, you're basically only missing out on artwork and a little box that will look nice on the shelf.\n\nTaking a contrarian approach, Bowie emphasizes his newest work first by sequencing the collection in reverse chronological order. This avoids the statement implied by so many anthologies which suggest that an artist had a span of time in the public eye followed by a slow decline with less interesting music.\n\nThe opener, Bowie's latest track, is new ground for him; he's been listening to some timeless jazz, the sound of which reflects the noir sensibility of the song's video. For the past twenty years Bowie's music has gradually gotten gloomier; this new song may be the deepest point in that emotional valley. (Is this married man syndrome, or Bowie keeping pace with a particular constituency, or just a recorded journal of where he's at these days?)\n\nThat's a sharp contrast to the joyful raveup which marks the start of Bowie's career (and the end of this box set), \"Liza Jane\". The aesthetic decision by the set's curator to introduce the casual listener to a half dozen or so songs from Bowie's early years distinguishes this 3CD version of \"Nothing Has Changed\" from any previous Bowie collections or box sets.\n\nA thumbnail description of this collection might be: a concise listing of hits and singles, mostly in their edited single versions, documenting the full span of Bowie's career to date. As an ardent Bowie fan I could complain about single edits vs. album cuts, the Berlin years covered in three singles instead of five or six, this or that song being excluded, but if the goal of the set was to present a tight list of just Bowie singles, this is it. The only legendary song that is definitely missing in action is \"Suffragette City\".\n\nI could assemble a second box set of this size comprised of songs not included here, but for the casual hitseeker who wants the public document of Bowie's career, here it is. It's a good place to start.\n\nUpdate after uploading the CD version to my Amazon cloud:\n\n\"Space Oddity\" is listed as \"UK Single Edit\" but it looks to be the full version of the song, running 5:14.\n\"Diamond Dogs\" fades out before the ending, trimming off ~15 seconds. Looks like this is the case with the digital download as well.\n\"I'm Afraid of Americans (V1)[Clean Edit]\" looks to be the same as [Radio Edit] on the \"Best of Bowie\" collection.","classification":5,"fold":1}
{"text":"When it has came down to Alicia Keys, she musically has been the best artist of the 2000 decade, because she put her voice and her talent into true art. But for her latest song, the lead single from her latest album Girl On Fire, she doesn't deliver with Nicki Minaj. Nicki honestly only helps to destroy the ivories that Alicia has made a mainstay brilliantly. I really felt the song was alright, but not really as strong as the music she had from her past album, The Element Of Freedom. There have been better collaborations that Alicia has done over the years, but this one didn't mix. Download the solo version of the song with Nicki's rap instead, and it honestly will be a better bet for your woman's worth.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"So here we have the elusive album by Janet Jackson that i have been trying to convince retailers actually exists ! Those of you in the know,know what i'm talking about.....trying to explain that Janet did have two albums prior to Control. For some reason people [among them Janet] have been trying to avoid this album's existence and i for the life of me don't know why,sure it doesn't have all the \"attitude\" of a Control or a Rhythm Nation but this was 1982 four years before Control and music was different then. To compare this to Control or \"rhythm\" is unfair,first off as i stated before music WAS different then,secondly,even tho the \"Minneapolis Sound\" was in full swing,it was done by grown folks like Prince,The Time,Vanity 6 among others,Janet was a 16 year old girl still living under the jackson's Compound and it was not until 1984's Dream Street that she started showing signs of rebel. I'm giving this album five stars because the music is good on here and Janet was in her purest form, just an r&b\/pop teen singer doing her thing. For those of you who care...there's a longer version of \"say you do\" on this album and it's better than the one that appeared on the original release, in my opinion also i have a new found fondness for the song \"forever yours\" and i always loved \"young love' that was my jam !

The sound is unique, hypnotic, beautiful, mysterious and flawless. This field of music is not the easiest to write in, if the songwriter wants to make songs that are as attention-grabbing as non-ambient songs and genres. But guess what? Nine Inch Nails creates a soundtrack for laying yourself down on your bed, staring at the ceiling, and getting those big smiles on your face every now and then when you think of some funny memory. Amazing instrumental music with a variety of different styles, while maintaining the same overall sound, and very highly recommended for those that want something both excellent and different.

{"text":"It's kind of funny how in many respects this is so much like Destiny's Child's album \"Destiny Fulfilled\". Why you ask? Because it seems like for much of the album he just bangs away at his piano. The songs sound quite alike and at times he seems too sorry for himself, this isn't saying the album is bad. Hopefully on his next album he will learn from some of the mistakes he made on this album. Some parts of the album are perfect, it's just not all of it is. Some of the lyrics seem a bit out of proportion for this album and don't seem to fit. Like the lyrics on \"Belief\" are a bit sexually driven and are quite stupid and lame. The whole album doesn't have a very sexually driven attitude at all, anyway that song is the only one that appears a bit out of the ordinary. \"Chariot\" has a very mature and overall wholesome feel to it. DeGraw seems to have real talent, writing all the songs himself in all, yet the comparisons I can make to Destiny's Child is unforgivable. Some of the songs are really amazing though, such songs as \"Follow Through\" and \"Chariot\".\n\nSo, I do recommend this album as you may find it different to how I found it. But this is my opinion and you know what I think I'll stick to that for the time being!","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"I don't care that he wears a silly hat.  The young man made a song that if you don't just want to shake your body and dance to then you lack something in your soul.  It's a fun, positive song which is missing so much these days.  Songs with an upbeat message aren't being made en mass like they used to decades ago.  Get it, listen to it, groove to it, dance to it, be happy to it!  Remember people, we don't stop playing because we get old, we get old because we stop playing!\n\nAs for the \"overplayed\" arena that this song will surely enter (if it hasn't already), all I can say is this is why I never (Or very very very rarely) listen to the radio.  This way when great songs do come along, I don't get sick of it in a week thanks to the whores that run top 40 radio stations (ie:  \"Z\" or \"Zoo\" stations) that milk every fraction of a scent of any song they can, by playing it 20 times a day and editing it down to 3 minutes or less (Got to get as many songs in a day as possible JUST so we can say \"We play the MOST music\" - like that's something to be proud about.)","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"An Intricate & Captivating Masterpiece!\n\nWhen I heard \"Apologize\" for the first time on my stereo I was immediately blown away. I haven't heard such a beautifully, elegantly orchestrated song before in my entire life, or at least for a very very long time. I can't recall such an experience in the last couple of years.\n\nNeedless to say, I purchased \"Dreaming Out Loud\" on a whim because it was on sale for eight bucks and an album can't be that awful, contain fifteen songs, and be hideous for that price. I ended up discovering probably one of my favorite new bands of all time and discovering music on a level unexplainable.\n\nRyan Tedder is music producer talent extraordinaire. He has been on the map for the last few years being behind the scenes, but his duet with Timbaland really put this superstar on the map. Lyrics and production by Ryan for \"Bleeding Love\" just really put him on the map and it only went uphill from there when \"Halo\" was released. The boy just excels, but I digress.\n\nDreaming Out Loud was constantly being rotated on my Zune and its one of the few albums that I listen to on a daily basis. With each listen I found something new to love, or noticed something in the lyrics that wasn't there before and just fell more in love with OneRepublic. I always thought in my head that if time came for their next album that it would just be a big feat to topple the mass appeal that was DOL. I have to say after listening to \"Waking Up\" that OneRepublic has done just so. If you loved DOL then you will love their latest effort \"Waking Up\". It's a CD full of new great material from an amazing band. The album is definitely more alternative and a bit different from the first, but it's still got the OneRepublic magic touch. Ryan has such a wonderful way of using words, so intricate and captivating. The album is a feel good album and just gives you the feeling of hope and the sentiment emotion to want to leave earth a better person.\n\nMy favorite track is SECRETS. When the song starts and I heard those violins playing, I knew I was in for a treat and it was nothing bit a sweet treat. The sound of those violins were beyond hypnotic and Ryan plays and blends the lyrics and the chorus so seamlessly that it's nothing but stellar. Profound music on a cosmological level.\n\nThe only down side is that there are only eleven tracks. I was hoping for fifteen again. Get the album and enjoy what a real masterpiece album is about.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I really love Bad Religion. I saw them in Calgary in 2009 and was third from the front. Greg Graffin pointed at me several times. I remember during American Jesus, the guy next to me put his arm around me as we shouted the lyrics out. That was a seriously amazing time.\n\n2010 would have been an awesome music year. Iron Maiden, my favorite band, put out their best album yet: The Final Frontier. In other news, Avenged Sevenfold released the half-assed Nightmare, Linkin Park continued their downfall with A Thousand Suns, and then this. Now I'll admit I did half expect this from Bad Religion- Everything after The Gray Race disappointed me (minus The Process of Belief and a few tracks from Empire).\n\nThe Day The Earth Stalled is a nice, fast paced opener, although it could have been longer. 3\/5\n\nOnly Rain is easily the best track off the album and the closest to the Bad Religion I love. Great lyrics too. 5\/5\n\nResist Stance is reminiscent of Suffer, so I like it a lot, plus Greg sounds awesome! 4\/5\n\nWon't Somebody- OK now this is where the album takes a nosedive. This could have been in a Tim Horton's commercial, it is that bland. 2\/5\n\nThe Devil in Stitches- Boring. 1\/5\n\nPride and the Pallor- Ditto.\n\nWrong Way Kids has a catchy chorus and that's about it. 2\/5\n\nMeeting of the Minds is a song that had potential to be great- they were going in the right direction when the did it, but they got to the chorus... what a disappointment. 3\/5\n\nSomeone to Believe- OK seriously this is ridiculous. I cant believe Bad Religion did this. This sounds like post Nimrod Green Day (and I don't mean that in a good way) 0\/5.\n\nAvalon- HELL YES!!!!!!!!! FINALLY beneath the grime is a kickass face melter. Seriously this is why I listen to Bad Religion 5\/5.\n\nCyanide is just as good as Avalon. 5\/5\n\nTurn Your Back On Me, Ad Hominem (yuck) and the last 2 tacks are all boring and bland ways to o out.\n\nIn short this album is a disappointment. It's about time they hung it up.","classification":2,"fold":1}

More like dissa-point-a-dice!\n\nIsn't it somehow a warm and fuzzy story to know that these guys made BIG BUCKS by going soft and less imaginative. You could almost hear a record exec let out a contented \"ahhh\" as he happily recounts \"No more illuminating synth passages and Church organ, it's time to watch the green roll in!\" Although there are some fine moments here, it's not the concise but mystical sounding prog\/hard rock of \"The Grand Illusion\" and \"Pieces of Eight\". If they were a political party they could have had a slogan like \"No more surprises\" or, more to the point, \"No more edginess\".\n\nNot that Styx were ever that 'cutting edge', but at least they hadn't forgotten how to write well-crafted evocative songs, with the gorgeously melodious \"She cares\", the emotive \"The best of times\", the haunting \"Snowblind\" or the closing \"Half-Penny Two-Penny\", which has a prolonged, dramatic finale.\n\nNow if Dennis DeYoung had bothered to add some fantasy synths to give it a less predictable taste, I probably wouldn't bother saying \"I really only give this 3 1\/2 stars\", and wouldn't feel that 4 stars was 'rounding up'.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"I was sent a copy of Abica's third album, Numb, without ever having heard this band's music before. It took a few listens for me to truly grasp this band, but in the end I found Numb to be a very competent effort from a band that quite plainly has a bright future ahead of them.\n\nThe music teeters between full-on hip-hop\/rap to alternative rap\/rock reminiscent of Limp Bizkit and old Linkin Park. Layers of synths swirl alongside heavy guitars and drums to create an energetic soundscape that completely carries this album. The production on the record is top-notch, and some of the best instrumentation I've heard in this genre. Furthermore, the album has just the right amount of variety to keep it interesting. At sixteen tracks, you may think it'll be a bit on the long side, but the songs sound different enough that you will never feel the length. Standout tracks include \"Tell Us Why\", \"The Things You Think I Say\", \"Take This Away\", \"Gave Em A Reason\", \"Never That Far Away\" and \"What You See\". I must especially single out \"Gave Em A Reason\" as probably the best track on this album. It's a high-energy thrasher that keeps going till the very end. On a side-note, from hearing the record I would imagine Abica's live shows to be some of the most energetic and intense around!\n\nUnfortunately, the album does stumble in a few places. Lyrically, it's hit or miss. Not that the lyrics are bad, far from it, but they sometimes feel a bit overly simplistic. It's striking since it's such a stark contrast from the meticulously-crafted music behind them. A prime example of this is \"Beautiful\", which despite the brilliant backdrop ends up being a rather generic hook-up song. Another head-scratcher is \"Blurry\", which is an awkward reconstruction of the song \"24\" by Jem (with no mention of original songwriters Jem Griffiths and Justin Griffiths in the linear notes). It's not a remake, the music, beat and chorus share the same melody with \"24\" but the lyrics are original. I personally felt the song lacks the punch of Jem's version and ends up the weakest point on the record. Also, and this isn't really criticism, around two times on the album there is some very melodic singing during the song's bridge. I would really like to hear more of that! Not that the rapping and raspy vocals are bad, but the singing just added a little uplift that gave those songs a little more depth.\n\nBut ultimately, Numb's numerous strengths far outweigh its few drawbacks. Abica has created a strong and robust album that's sure to please fans and invite new ones. I really enjoy this album, and I definitely look forward to future releases. I'm anxious to see how this band grows and evolves in the years to come.","classification":4,"fold":1}

Have no fear, she doesn't want to be the next Skrillex, it's a great little Rocker. Other upbeat numbers are the bouncy \"22\", the sassy lead-single \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" (which is catchy Power Pop Katy Perry would kill for), the unabashed Country bounce of \"Stay Stay Stay\" (a fun song with the lyrics \"I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night, I threw my phone across the room at you, I was expecting some dramatic turn away, But you stayed, This morning I said we should talk about it, Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved, That's when you came in wearing a football helmet, And said okay let's talk...\"), the pulsing Rocker \"Holy Ground\", and the shimmery \"Starlight\" (with a lovely ballad intro).\n\nHowever, it's on the ballads she truly shines. The chiming pulsing \"All Too Well\", \"The Last Time\" (a dark and hushed duet with Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody with truly spectacular results), the tender \"Sad Beautiful Tragic\" (an acoustic Country\/Folk number), \"The Lucky One\" (with interesting percussion), \"Everything Has Changed\" (a mellow duet with UK Pop\/Folk\/Hip Hop singer Ed Sheeran perfectly harmonizing with Swift), and the absolutely enchanting quivery \"Begin Again\" ending things on a suitable high note.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Boyz II Men made it huge in the 90s by pairing up their tight harmonies recalling classic Motown groups (Temps and Tops) with more up-to-date rhythmic tracks incorporating samples and other hip-hop stylings. This album broke them into superstardom as their followup to \"Cooleyhighharmony\", placing 4 songs into the charts for the Philadelphia group.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\nThis album pretty much divides into 2 'sides': The uptempo side (before \"Khalil\") and the ballads afterwards. Most of the biggest chart tunes fall in the 2nd half.\n\nPart 1 has \"Thank You\" (the only up-tempo chart hit), an infectious number riding a Doug E. Fresh sample. \"Vibin'\" is a nice midtempo groove though the lyric's  pretty lightweight (We're just vibin'\/dancin' the night away\/Groovin'\/Vibin'\/non-stop until the break of day). \"I Sit Away\" is a Tony Rich tune about drowning in self pity that stops short of being maudlin. (This and \"Nobody Knows\"..is Rich clinically depressed or what?)\n\nIn the \"slow side\", Babyface's \"I'll Make Love to you\" set a record for the length of time at #1. \"On Bended Knee\" (from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis) and \"Water Runs Dry\" (another Babyface composition) also made some chart action. The group shows off their sterling harmonies on the Beatles classic \"Yesterday\" and they pull off the true feat of not embarrassing themselves on a rock classic. It's a wonderful rendition.\n\nLOWS:\n\n\"All Around the World\" is Boyz II Men's rewrite of Ricky Nelson's \"Travelin' Man\" more or less, but not nearly as memorable. Considering how pivotal it is to the album, \"Khalil\" is a pretty blah track. \"Jezzebel\" is a dull overlong affair. \"50 Candles\" includes the lyric \"Holding your body like a plastic molding\"....'nuff said.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nThere are enough hits to make this a mini-greatest hits all by itself, but the extras like \"I Sit By\" and \"Yesterday\" make this one worth owning. Recommended for R&B fans.","classification":4,"fold":1}

We'll raise a glass to Mr. Zevon, who was there when The Eagles, Ronstadt, Jackson Browne and so many others made the music that mattered. He stood out, not as a hit maker, but as chronicler of what he saw and lived, and like Joni Mitchell, was unafraid to be very personal about his life and the people around him. Like Randy Newman, he was a songwriter's songwriter, and you either came to his party or missed out. This collection is a great way to introduce yourself to him, and I suggest you sit back back, put down the Smith and Wesson, and enjoy some chicken and Jim Beam.

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":1}
{"text":"So do we really need to hear this? I guess if you are an Al Kooper fan, there is some merit, although, the Kooper kuts here were done better and more dramatically with BS&T. Bloomfield never impressed me much, so he has that NY Long Island playing style that worked in the Catskills, but came off as less than convincing outside that circuit. Stills? Please. What was the first side of this record was made stronger by virtue of the fact that Stills turned in a workmanlike effort. Sure, played hard, not much to show for it. I do suspect that this effort was the nascent arrival of an insufferable ego that would only undermine him as time wore on.\nGive credit to the remastering crew, though. You can hear pristinely how overwrought every note on this disc is. The 2002 remixes are a waste on top of something as thoroughly unnecessary as anything I've ever heard.

{"text":"I would add this light, upbeat version to play along side Johnny Mathis, Andy Williams and similar classic Christmas music, although this is a little more modern version.  The voices are very \"soft\" and perform in a gentle harmony.  Contrast that with other versions that may have richer or bolder harmony; this, however, stands well on its own merits.  There are some jazzy riffs here and there, some soft, jazzy hi hat\/drum rhythm in the background.  I don't think any one voice stands out on this piece, but together they work very well. Not quite the Lennon Sisters (if you know who they are), but along the same vein.  Personally, I enjoyed this piece and am pleased to add it to my Christmas music collection.\n\nIf Lawrence Welk was alive today and continuing his show, I think you would hear this group performing this piece on his show.

{"text":"I consider LB as hiphop revolutionaries just like Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Common, etc...  They may not have had very complex lyrics but their simple lyrics carried a lot of knowledge.  They are AWAKE to the world especially with racism, depression, and violence... check out \"Renee\", \"Channel Zero\", \"Lifestyles of the rich and famous\" if you don't believe me....\nTheir lyrics are on point and the beats are real nice... some tracks almost have an ATCQ feel to them.  There's no guest appearances on here so you'll expect to hear Mr. Cheeks doing all the lyrics with Freaky Tah providing backround vocals.  But Tah gets his chance to shine on \"1, 2, 3\" and he's an OK lyricist not as good as Cheekz though...\nThis is a very good debut CD for any group to come out with.  It's such a dissapointment that LB had to end their carreer due to the tragic loss of Freaky Tah... R.I.P...  and I heard now the Mr. Cheeks's latest solo attempt songs aren't up to his usual potential and it's sad to see one of hiphop's best groups vanish...\nCheck out this CD...\nI'm Out ....

{"text":"Worst album he has ever made. honestly, I am a Redman fan and I have all of his  cds.  I hate to do this to Mr Reggie but this cd is a joke.  This album is like a collection of throw away tracks that never made any albums or mixtapes.  Only two songs are good and the rest are just horrible. What is with the slow R&B tracks and the auto tune?  Most of the guest emcees aren't worthy and add nothing to the failure called an album.  I just can't see Redman giving the okay to drop this cd.  Something tells me this was an album owed to the record label and wanted out of his contract.  Not sure, the artist must still realize that his reputation and name is still on it.  Again, I am huge Redman fan and I really hated to do this to my boy.  But, if he is going to have the audacity to release this album, then why can't I tell him and others the truth?  Stay away from this album.  or buy the two songs that are actually okay.  Redman, you owe me for this turd.","classification":1,"fold":1}

{"text":"Continued Silence EP was Imagine Dragon's first album, which only had 6 songs on it, since it was probably designed as a trailer for this album. Night Visions is ID's first real album, and I like it. We mainly got it for Radioactive, but every other song is good, too. Many of them have kind of a tribal feel to them, especially some of the older songs from Continued Silence EP. Let's go through every song.\n\nRadioactive: Begins the album off with a song from CSE. After a slow intro with Dan Reynolds singing softly, the music builds up into a timeless song about the Apocalypse. It's timeless because the Apocalypse could happen any time in history. Need I say more? Classic song! [5\/5]\n\nTiptoe: This is the first new one, and by far, my favorite. It really makes me want to dance and have fun. You are going to love this song! [6\/5]\n\nIt's Time: This song was alright, but it doesn't have anything special that makes it stand out. The sound quality wasn't too good, either. But it does have a pretty mandolin used in it, so that'll make me bump up my rating to a [4\/5].\n\nDemons: What can I say? Another classic from CSE, including some meaningful lyrics. You might know it as \"Kingdom Come.\" [5\/5]\n\nOn Top Of The World: There are two kinds of people in the world -- People who loved this song right as it came out, and those who took a while for it to grow on them. I was one of those people. But right as I learned to like it, I loved it! If you're one of those people like me, don't expect to enjoy it instantly. Give it time to grow on you. [4\/5]\n\nAmsterdam: After a somewhat slow intro, it turns into another great song. The lyrics remind me of Train, which is good because Train is another band that I enjoy. I like how the lyrics were fast-paced and it sounds fun the way Dan's voice slides up and down. Amsterdam is also the name of a Guster song. [4\/5]\n\nHear Me: My personal second favorite on the album. It's a little more poppy than some of ID's other songs [think Tiptoe] than of their more rockin' songs [Think Radioactive]. Like Amsterdam, Dan's voice slides a little up and down, and I think that's the main reason why I enjoyed this song so much. [5\/5]\n\nEvery Night: \"I'm comin' home to you\/ Every night, every night, every night, every night!\" This song is repetitive and catchy, but other than that, mediocre. A bit slower than the other songs, but not exactly a ballad. [3\/5]\n\nBleeding Out: Don't get me wrong, I like just about every song on this album, except this one. It sounds like a lot of the other songs, it's boring, and the lyrics are actually a little gross. Maybe it'll grow on me after a couple listens, but now, I just don't like it. [2\/5]\n\nUnderdog: Better than Bleeding Out. The simple intro reminded me of \"Best\/ Day Of My Life\" by American Authors, but soon turned into another funky Imagine Dragons song. There are also some interesting 8-bit sound effects. I didn't like them at first, but they didn't bother me on the second listen. Just like Every Night, the chorus is repetitive and catchy. The \"Hey!\" makes you want to sing or dance along. [4\/5]\n\nNothing Left to Say \/ Rocks: Before I listened to this one I had two questions -- 1.) Why is the title the way it is? 2.) Why is it so long? Then I found out the answer to both of my questions -- This is two songs in one. I don't know why the band would want to do that, but it's certainly interesting. Nothing Left to Say is an epic song, once again, about love. I actually think they used an organ in the intro -- Creepy! The rest of the song actually reminded me of rushing to somewhere important on a rainy day. Eventually, Dan Reynolds starts softly vocalizing until the song ends at 6:32 [He does this for a long time, so it's a little repetitive]. Then the songs is completely silent, until song #2, Rocks, begins at 6:47. Rocks is a very fast-paced tribal sounding song about \"Throwing rocks upon somebody's window.\" It doesn't seem like it would be the best finisher song, but it does a good job of ending the album, surprisingly. Very interesting song, overall... or should I say two songs? [5\/5 [for both songs]]\n\nWell, there you have it, people, \"Night Visions\" by Imagine Dragons. I heard a lot of people complaining that the sound quality was bad, but I only noticed that on Radioactive and It's Time. Best of all, it's perfectly clean! I would recommend this album for anybody, especially fans of FUN and American Authors. I wouldn't recommend Continued Silence EP, though, because the sound quality on that album is worse, and the thing is only around 19 minutes -- This album is 43 minutes. Now stop reading this and buy the album!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"This is looking and sounding like another impressive set of recordings from the Bach Guild\/Vanguard catalogue. The David Blum recordings have already been issued as part of the Bach Guild's \"Big Summer Box\" so I hope that they are not running out of recordings and thus starting to follow Amazon's habit of duplicating tracks in bargain sets like the \"99 Essential\" etc series.\nThe Yale String Quartet performances are excellent in both the string quartets and the Piano quartets (played here with maestro Peter Serkin). I thought it would be good to hear Eine Kleine Nachtmusik in its string quartet format played in by the Griller Quartet, but I suspect that this is, in fact, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra conducted by Felix Prohaska in a Vanguard recording that, in LP form was distributed as a HiFi demonstration record along with the 40th Symphony (and in the same 1965 sessions as the No. 41?). After nearly 50 years the HiFi is not so Hi these days but these are enjoyable recordings. We can, however, enjoy the English Griller quartet in four String Quintets, joined by the great William Primrose, who is only credited in two of the four quintets presented here from the Griller.\n\nWe are also treated to performances of three piano concertos and some solo piano works by Alfred Brendel and Denis Matthews. Brendel is well known as a master pianist. These are some of his earlier recordings but they are a joy to hear,lovely, sensitively played performances.\n\nWe also hear piano sonatas and concertos played by the late Denis Matthews, a fine scholar and pianist. They sonatas are lightly and precisely presented with a good intimate recording. Matthews also is represented by a recording of piano concertos, numbers 20 and 24 with another Vienna orchestra, the Vienna State Opera Orchestra, an orchestra made up of musicians from the Vienna Philharmonic, who are contractually tied to both orchestras and who thus bring a very high quality of playing from what is clearly more than a \"pit\" orchestra.\n\nAfter Bach Guild's errors in the Big Beethoven Box I have to be careful not to search through the box looking for errors, and not listening to the excellent recordings presented. However, just two errors found so far, the mislabeling of the second movement of the Piano Quartet K 478. It should be \"ii. Andante \", and the Eine Kleine Nachtmusik previously mentioned (which also has a rather premature cut-off at the end of the second movement).\n\nI especially enjoyed listening to the Flute and Harp Concerto, nicely balanced with a not-too-strident flute and sympathetic orchestral accompaniment. The Symphonies (40 and 41)and opera overtures are nicely played with a sweet tone and some intense musicality from Felix Prohaska and the Vienna Symphony Orchestra an often under-rated cousin of the Vienna Philharmonic, but at their best in this kind of music.\n\nThis same orchestra, under the conductor Hans Swarowsky, is joined by Oboist Andre Lardot in the only oboe concerto written by Mozart. This is a fine performance, if not exciting, with a the oboe set back a little in a fairly lively acoustic, which I quite like, a more natural concert hall kind of sound.\n\nThis is a true bargain at 99c, it will rise in price soon so grab it while you can.","classification":5,"fold":1}

Lemmie vocals are on spot, Mickey Dees drums are pounding and Campbells riffs are killer. I have personally gone nuts over this band. Down to roots ole rock n roll just on another speed. How they get so many different rythmns and riffs out of 3 guys and continued to roll out cd after cd is amazing. I also have to say that another thing that I love about Lemmie is that his lyrics make me laugh outloud at times, I don't know about others but some of his lines are just ridiculously funny to me. MY bud in the local music store agrees with me, I was afraid to say anything at first but once I did he immeadiately agreed.

{"text":"Just as Slipknot's last album, 2008's \"All Hope Is Gone,\" was, the same can be said about their new one, \"5: The Gray Chapter,\" in that it, too, would make for the perfect career-ending retrospective. In this case, the band has produced a record that is kind of an amalgamation of all of their records, including the aged-but-fun angst heard on their now fifteen-year-old debut, the all-out brutality of 2001's \"Iowa,\" and the more melodic and textured approach found on their latter-day material (starting with 2004's \"Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses\"). What this means is that \"\"Gray\" couples together Helmet-inspired stop-start hooks and Korn-esquedowntuned guitars with vocals that alternate between both the shredded-throat type and the soaring, harmonious variety.\n\nWhat this also means is that, despite being the first record not to include bassist Paul Gray (whom the band lost to a drug overdose in 2010), and drummer Joey Jordison (who was fired from the group in 2013), Slipknot sound like they have not missed a beat. For one thing, they have recruited a new skinsman who is every-bit-the-capable trapkit annihilator that Jordison was. And his identity might remain a secret, but his playing is also exceptionally tight, technical, and forceful (he is sure to include plenty of blast beats). But with that said, it is important to note that there definitely are a few new and original ideas present, here, including nearly perfectly balancing their harsh and dissonant music with an equal-sized dollop of harmony. As a result, what frontman Corey Taylor and Company have crafted, here, should probably go down as one of the most accomplished and well-rounded efforts of their long and storied career.\n\nThe really foreboding intro track that is \"XIX\" sets the stage perfectly for \"Sarcastrophe,\" a cut of almost pure thrash, what with its thrashy picking, and pummeling drum blasts and thrash beats. Corey's vocals, meanwhile, usually consist of an unusually bratty screaming style, thus helping to up the intensity to a level that is all-but guaranteed to make your pulse pound. It is one very intense and brutal number, if nothing else. \"AOV\" is another steady, thrashy pummeling, but one that augments its furious buzzsaw riffing and hammering skins with an undeniably melodic side, including some Stone Sour-esque wailing that sound not unlike many-a-song circulating on numerous modern hard rock radio stations. So while this number is first and foremost a brutal one, it does possess a certain accessibility which comes from a sweet and catchy backing vocal refrain (\"ooooh\").\n\nThe next couple of songs, \"The Devil In I\" (the record's second single) and the propulsive \"Killpop,\" abide by the same brutal-yet-tuneful policy in that they both feature clean singing and proggy melodic guitar pockets. But any notion of melody quickly vanishes when the songs slam head-first into brutal, pummeling thrash runs and mosh pit-stoking choruses. (And the former of these two tunes is also of note for opening with a really catchy and rhythmically marching cadence.) Next up comes \"Skeptic,\" another agitating, blood pumping angst-fest that is packed with staccato riffing, tight and precise drumming, and really memorable, chant-along, fist-pumping choruses. As such, the song ultimately comes across sounding kind of like something off of Slipknot's eponymous debut.\n\nLater cuts, including \"Lech\" and \"The One That Kills The Least,\" boast catchy, eardrum-snagging staccato guitar hooks and drum beats, and augments it with the usual allotment of angsty, throat-tearing screams. As solid as these two tracks are, though, (especially \"Lech,\" as \"The One That Kills\" seems to kind of stand out as filler material), they are both overshadowed by \"Goodbye\" and \"Nomadic.\" The former piece offsets its brutal musical backdrop (with slamming blast beats) with unorthodoxly tuneful singing (most of the time), and epically huge, melodical choruses. And a brief but noteworthy, wah-heavy guitar solo is tacked on to the end of the mix, here, too. And \"Nomadic\" takes a similar path, as a steady, thrashy beating, albeit one with a short-but-sweet melodic guitar solo and huge, sing-songy choruses.\n\n\"Custer\" is a really catchy and slam-danceable rant centered around an unforgettably anthemic, fist-pumpable chorus; but the next track after that, \"Be Prepared For Hell,\" dials things down a bit by being an unnervingly creepy, skin-crawling interlude. And next we have lead-single \"The Negative One,\" which is an insanely catchy cut that seemingly takes Slipknot's combined sound from over the years and meshes it all together into one, five-minute, twenty-five-second long frame. It features deft D.J. scratches, great drumming (i.e. tight, rolling drum fills), foaming-at-the-mouth vocals, and groovy guitar licks. It has another memorable chorus, too. And finally, the set concludes with its sole anomaly: \"If Rain Is What You Want\" is a spooky, foreboding, dark, and creepy near ballad, although it is one that is home to a few chunky, chugging power chords, up-tempo drum fills, and a wah-heavy guitar lead.\n\n\"5: The Gray Chapter\" lacks the novelty that Slipknot's aforementioned debut had when it first dropped onto the alternative-extreme metal world in mid-1999. And it also cannot claim to be nearly the ingeniously-written and\/or groundbreaking piece of music that 2008's \"All Hope Is Gone\" was. But even if it is not without flaws, this album is so well-done that it deserves to be deemed a worthy purchase to all fans of any of the band's previous releases. And, as this reviewer said in his review of this band's last album, if this is `Knot's last-ever release, then at least they went out with one-heckuva bang!","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"As much as I loved Born This Way (the album, not the song specifically), I think Lady Gaga has made some bad decisions with choices of singles. (Or maybe her record company made some bad choices of singles. It's hard to tell, since she seems to have a lot more control over her career than a lot of artists.) Either way, there wasn't a lot on Born This Way that was truly radio friendly.\n\n\"Born This Way\" was a little heavy-handed and possibly offensive with her choice of racial descriptions (i.e. chola, Orient). \"Judas\" was also possibly offensive and a little annoying.\n\n\"Edge of Glory\" was a real winner though. It's catchy, it's big, it's a more straightforward story. It's the kind of song that you can listen to in your car or home and sing along with and love. Releasing this as a single is the single smartest thing Lady Gaga and her record company did to promote her new album.\n\nThis may have more mainstream appeal than anything else Lady Gaga has ever written.\n\n\"Edge of Glory\" has a building, later booming melody. It has a fantastic sax solo from the late, great Clarence Clemmons. What could be better than that?","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"On Pins & Needles, Birthday Massacre manage to become both heavier and melodic at the same time. Well, heavier in regards to their guitar sound anyway. Their trademark arpeggiated synth sound is still in full force as is their sense for melancholy lyrics. To put it simply, if Walking With Strangers had been a double album, Pins & Needles could have been the second disc. There doesnt seem to be any new styles approached on this record, rather it is another set of great dark and poppy industrial rock songs. Nothing wrong with that. The album has a cohesive feel and listeners will be starving for more after the last track. The only downside is that I'm partial to them ending their records on a solemn note like the last album. However, on this record the album ends with a more upbeat number, which gives the album an overall rockin' vibe. Great Alice In Wonderland-esque artwork as usual too. This album was made for the fans of the band and will definitely satisfy the music lover looking for some accessible pop that still retains a dark edge not found on the radio. Highlights include Always, Shallow Grave, and Secret, but the whole album flows as one piece of art which more than makes up for the short running time.\n\nGreat album worth picking up. :)","classification":5,"fold":1}

I was thumbing thru itunes to find live albums of my favorite artist's and came across this jewel by Lady Soul Aretha Franklin. To me this is the essence of Aretha... every song is a master piece and once you hear her sing you will understand why people gave her such a hard time about changing over from Gospel to R&B\/Soul.\n\n I knew Aretha was a power house but this is the best I have heard her. My Mother told me that she thinks we all sound better when we sing Gospel... Well Ms. Franklin made a believer out of me.\n\nEvery song is an A Game recording (Especially with the force behind her known as The Southern California Community Choir)\n\nMarvin Gaye's \"Wholy Holy\"(From the What's Going On Album) has always been one of my favorite songs, I liked it even more when Mavis Staples performed it on the Cosby Show.. but Aretha's version is the best in my opinion and it is officially my favorite song and this is my favorite album for the rest of my life.\n\nOther personal favorites are \"Precious Memories\"(Featuring Rev. James Cleveland) , \"Mary Don't You Weep\", \"Precious Lord\", \"GOD Will Take Care Of You\" and \"Amazing Grace\"\n\nThis is still the biggest selling album in ReRe's 50+ year career and once you hear it you will know why #2 R&B, #7 Pop, Double Platinum in sales and a Grammy for Best Gospel Album.\n\nThis album has made me feel closer to GOD than I have felt in a very long time.

{"text":"In the early months of 1961 the pop music scene in America was pretty dreary. With instrumentals like Burt Kaempfert's \"Wonderland By Night\" and Lawrence Welk's \"Calcutta\" topping the charts American teenagers were casting about looking for exciting new sounds to latch on to. In February 1961 the New York based disc jockey Murray \"The K\" Kaufman secured a copy of a recording session tape made by an unknown Pittsburgh based doo-wop group called The Marcels. The group had just signed with the recently-launched Colpix label in NYC. What Murray the K heard that day was the wildest version of the Rogers & Hart standard \"Blue Moon\" that had ever been attempted to that point. He was positively captivated by the tune and without telling either the record company or the group he began playing it over and over again on his show. Realizing they had a huge hit on their hands Colpix rush-released the single in the final days of February, \"Blue Moon\" reached #1 in New York City in just one short week and was topping the charts nationwide inside of a month. \"Blue Moon\" continues to be one of the most beloved oldies of all-time.  This is the historic hit recording you would remember from the radio.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Let Freedom Reign is a great progression in Chrisette's musical career. I was blown away by the originality of her debut album and while her second was good, I felt that her creativity and songwriting ability were subjugated by the label thinking that pairing her with Ne-Yo would garner crossover appeal.\n\nLet Freedom Reign is a phenomenal album featuring strong songwriting & lyrical arrangements and just plain good music. It ranks up there with Erykah Badu, Monica & Fantasia's recent albums as a cohesive, consistent r&b album. As a fan of strong singer\/songwriters, I am glad that Chrisette seemingly went with her gut and wrote 98% of the songs. Personally this is what draws me to her as an artist - her lyrics are thought-provoking and deep and while the album doesn't have a lot of hook-driven tracks, it is a grower because the more I listen to it, the better it gets.\n\nTo those who listened once and are disappointed, please give it more of a chance to \"marinate on your brain\" by listening to it over time because this album is brilliant in construction & content. Unfortunately for Chrisette she is not a priority of her label so hopefully good word of mouth about this album will cause more people to give her music a chance. She is one of few young r&b female artists who are intelligent, write thoughtful lyrics and don't use sex to sell their image and I appreciate that and hope that more people discover her music.\n\nMy standout tracks are: I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I DO; GOODBYE GAME; I KNOW NOTHING; IF NOBODY SANG ALONG; I'M A STAR & NUMBER ONE. (**IF NOBODY SANG ALONG is an especially honest track on which Chrisette debates selling out her image & songs so that she can fit in with other artists vs. remaining true to herself.)","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Rob Dougan is justly best-known for his track \"Clubbed to Death,\" which first appeared when Mo'Wax was a can't-miss label. And the cinematic quality which marked that track (as well as the track itself) reappear on his debut album, _Furious Angels_. More interesting, Dougan adds his hoarse vocals to his creations, which veer more towards country-western than to pure electronic music. It's an interesting combination, if not an entirely successful one. The title track has a gospel chorus that add tension to some potentially overwrough lyrics. \"Will You Follow Me?\" sounds as if it came straight off a soundtrack -- John Williams would be proud. Not sure what Mr. Williams would think of the dirge-like \"Left Me for Dead,\" however. At times, Dougan sounds as if he's straining his voice in an attempt at emotion, and it's at odds with the elegant orchestrations. When he doesn't try as hard, as on \"There's Only Me,\" he gets across a sense of desperation and sadness much better, as does the melancholy trip-hop and warbling falsetto of \"Nothing At All.\" Not surprisingly, on the instrumental disc, the tracks in which Dougan's vocals proved problematic feel improved with just the strings, but the ones in which the vocals were an asset feel slightly empty. But the most surprising track would be \"Drinking Song,\" which has much of the simplicity and directness of the Pogues' \"Fairytale of New York.\" It brings romanticism to a drunken haze -- reminiscing with a gravelly voice.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Sunshine Anderson was quite a surprise for me! Never have I heard such soulful singing in such a long time. There is only one other artist these days who still manages to make great soulful R&B music, and that is Mary J Blige, so it was welcome for another singer to follow suit and create some really memorable music. Your Woman is a collection of soul songs that will keep you singing, and its a great cd to relax with while listening. Never Heard it Before is addictive, you will probably listen to it continuously until you hear the rest of this album. Other highlights include He Said, She Said; Where Have You Been; Letting Down My Guard; Your Woman; Crazy Love and more. Give Sunshine Anderson a try, shes a very talented young lady and you will agree when you hear that voice!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I couldn't resist swiping another review's title.  That person's point is that this song sounds like their other songs.  Mine is that the song, itself, sounds mostly the same all the way through.\n\nIt's a high energy rock song.  It starts with a wall of guitar sound that remains mostly unchanged through the first 2\/3 of the song.  High energy drums.  But dynamic; there is no rise or fall in volume level; pretty much just loud all the way up to that 2\/3.  While there are chord changes, the wall of guitar at the beginning has a way of hiding them.\n\nObviously this song did not do much for me, even though I'm a fan of many kinds of music.\n\nThen again, for people who like this kind of music, this is just the sort of music they'd like! ;-)","classification":3,"fold":1}

They haven't surpassed that album, but they've maintained themselves creatively at the same level, at least.\n\nThere are some great \"pop\" choruses on this record, such as the choruses of \"Motherload\", \"High Road\", and \"Ember City\", all courtesy of Brann Dailor on vocals.\n\nThere are no bad songs on this album. It's all killer. \"Aunt Lisa\" probably as the most killer groove, but the whole album is crazy good.\n\nHoping the Mastadudes come to Miami in support of this record!

{"text":"As the story goes one morning in 1967 Smokey Robinson and fellow Motown songwriter Al Cleveland were shopping at Hudson's, a Detroit department store. Robinson found a set of pearls for his wife, Claudette. \"They're beautiful.\" he said to the salesperson. \"I sure hope she likes them.\" Cleveland then added \"I second that emotion.\" Both songwriters laughed at Cleveland's verbal error; he had meant to say \"I second that motion.\" The two were immediately inspired to write a song using the incorrect phrase. The culmination of their efforts was Smokey Robinson and the Miracles huge hit \"I Second That Emotion\". The song would peak at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 around Christmas 1967. It would be one of The Miracles biggest hits ever.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"LONERISM was the second album from Tame Impala and again sees Australian musician Kevin Parker recording most of the instrumental parts. Following on Tame Impala's debut&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Innerspeaker\/dp\/B003HGKJH8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Innerspeaker<\/a>, the sound again has some references to the 1960s in its guitar tone, floating ambience and Lennon\/McCarthyesque vocals. There's no doubt that the first three tracks, \"Be Above It\", \"Endors Toi\" and \"Apocalypse Dreams\" are well-crafted pop songs, with the last one presenting a more complex architecture than we heard on the first album.\n\nAfter than, I've failed to find anything impressive in over a year now of putting it on frequently and trying to give it a fair hearing. Even the tracks that are entertaining while the album is one are forgotten immediately after. Another sorely disappointing aspect of LONERISM is its relentless loudness. Parker pushed the levels very high during his home recording sessions, and then engineer Dave Fridmann could produce from this flawed basis only a dirty-sounding mix. It's a real pity that Parker drew so much on the Sixties without holding to one of that era's strongest features: dynamic range, sound that has room to breathe and show the listener various subtleties. According to other reviews, even the vinyl release features the same exhausting mix as the CD and MP3 releases.\n\nIf you loved INNERSPEAKER (and that album has really grown on me with time), then moving on to this followup may be worthwhile, as the opening tracks are quite good. However, to a large degree this is a letdown.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"I am not a country fan. I'm really not. Then again, I am fascinated by the music from Nashville. The on-repeat-for-days kind of fascinated. I wouldn't expect something this good out of a TV show, but the first time I heard this track, it sure did make my ears perk up and take the musical approach of this show seriously. Clare Bowen makes this song. Not that I have anything against the other guy & I do actually like his performance, but it's her voice that made me all ears and seduced me. There are very few tracks that I hear that make me feel that special magic the first time through & this has only become more special as I get more familiar. I am usually irritated by women who sing like they're 4 years old, but this is not that simple, she doesn't stop at the breathy baby doll, she sings like she's an adult who has some serious heart behind every word, both wanting to believe and wanting to be strong. It's a voice that strikes me more as the ephemeral Stevie Nicks of \"Rhiannon\" and \"Landslide\" or maybe Jewel back when she would actually sing \"Painters\" or \"Till We Run Out Of Road.\" Though, I suppose, trying to compare this with anyone is kind of unfair. \"Fade Into You\" is right up there with this & while \"I Will Fall\" isn't quite the same calibre, it's only because they knocked these two so far out of the park. I can play the set of them along with Connie Britton's \"No One WIll Ever Love You\" on repeat for hours.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"An album that has always seemed to divide BOC fans.  \"Imaginos\" is a concept album concocted by Albert Bouchard and Sandy Pearlman whose origins go almost back to the beginning of the band.  Two of the tracks on this album appear on \"Secret Treaties\" which serves as somewhat of a companion piece to \"Imaginos\".  The original BOC lineup re-united for this one along with a host of guests.  The concept is the story of Imaginos a time traveler of sorts who appears at different times in the world's history to influence historical events.  The problem is that the story is not told in a linear fashion and it ends up being completely confusing.  I have read essays on the story behind the story and still haven't really figured it all out.  This is a weird album for me, I think most of the songs on this disc are outstanding to the point of being some of the best stuff BOC has ever done, but looking at the album as a whole it is not quite as good as I think it should have been.  Being a big progressive rock fan maybe I set my expectations too high when I found out BOC was doing a true concept piece, but on this one the sum is not greater than it's parts.  That being said there is some really great material here.  The remakes of \"Astronomy\" and \"Blue Oyster Cult\" (formerly \"The Subhuman\") are better than the originals.  \"I Am The One You Warned Me Of\", \"Les Invisibles\", \"In The Presence Of Another World\", \"Del Rios Song\", \"The Siege.....\", \"Magna Of Illusion\" are all awesome.  The title track is a bit of a letdown, but still ok.  Still......even with all this great stuff, I think the album could have been put together better and re-worked to an extent.  Anyway this is a minor quibble as this album really is a must for any fans of BOC.  I believe it is currently out of print and hard to find.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"This grumpy old man is a 38-year veteran fan of Yes, in other words, difficult to please. I had my doubts when I first heard the sound clips and would have given it only 2-3 stars, which is not fair. Well, after running all over creation this morning on the day of it's release, I finally found a copy that I did not have to order, because getting a copy before the concert only three days away was my goal.\n\nI won't bore you with the details. It is way better than the average drek being released these days by other groups, and way better than Open Your Eyes or 90125. Will it stand the test of time and become a five-star classic like Close To The Edge or Relayer? Too soon to tell. Is it progressive? In it's own way, yes. Is it pop? Got that covered without being overtly commercial. Is Steve Howe's guitar and all of the vocal harmonies prominent? You bet. Enough for now. Just get it!\n\nUpdate: I finally got to watch the DVD, which is an interesting look at Trevor and the band in the studio discussing the making of this CD over a two-month period. Basically, they just trusted Trevor and it worked out great. Then I went looking for the live footage and could not find any. My copy does not specifically state this, so buyer beware. Since I had to have this in a hurry, I wound up spending an extra 8 bucks at my local retailer for something I will probably only watch once. For only 2 bucks more on Amazon, that's more like it and worth the chance. The lyric booklet is also included here, which I am not sure it is provided with the basic CD only. And yes, my 4-star rating still stands. What do the naysayers want?

{"text":"I'd never heard of Frazey Ford before, nor the band she had been a member of, the Be Good Tanyas. But after reading a rave review of this album, and finding out that her band on this album was the legendary Hi Records Rhythm Section, I just had to get this CD. I was a huge fan of the records that Willie Mitchell produced on Hi Records in the 1970s, particularly those amazing Al Green albums, and most of those same musicians that backed singers like Al Green, Ann Peebles, and Syl Johnson are on this album too. Say no more; gotta hear it!\n\nFirst impressions were favorable. An album with a really nice sound. At first, though, I wasn't crazy about the vocals. For me, Ford's voice took some getting used to. Her vocal style infuses a bluesy and soulful vibe, with an undercoating of folk elements. Not a traditionally \"great\" voice, but one that's packed with emotion and grit. I keep thinking that she reminds me of another singer, but darned if I can pinpoint who it is. What I like best about this album is the pace and atmosphere of these songs. They really flow well from one to another, Ford's vocals acting as almost another instrument in the mix. Obviously, she's got that crack band behind her, but lacking string and horn arrangements it doesn't sound remotely like any sort of Willie Mitchell production.  Clearly, Ford is following her own muse, and I think this is well worth hearing. Maybe the songs won't knock you out the first time, but the more you listen, the more it sinks in.\n\nI have the feeling that this could end up being one of those sneakily addictive albums that end up being a classic.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"When it has came down to Nicki MInaj and her worth in her music, its has been looked at being cheap, than strong in her own voice. Whatever it took to compile the music fr her album The Pink Print this past year, it honestly is not even worth the time or the money. Her collaborations have sincerely been less than strong for what she could come up with her own heart, and Only from The Pink Print is definitely no exception. The collaboration with Chris Brown, Lil' Wayne, and Drake does not even come close to igniting from the heart at all. Instead, it is weak for her, with what they do bring to the game. The song is haunting but lagging the essence in song. I think if Nicki really wants to have better for own work, she should do more with her collaborations to make it completely worth her weight in the diamond. Only really was a cheap song, and I sincerely do not recommend it.\n\nSong: F+","classification":1,"fold":1}

But nevertheless, he hasn't really made anything to mark his own territory in songs at all. But that has definitely changed with Happy, the lead song from the film Despicable Me 2. The song definitely has been a surprise that really is a delightful pop song, that sounds absolutely much better than the absolute joke songs from Beyonce' Knowles or Rihanna that have been so severely overplayed, and just stopped delivering real talent.

{"text":"Back To Birth is a significant change for Jackie Greene ... yes his music has always had an authentically rootsy style and presentation, yet here we find very little of the rock n roller who gave us such classics as  Mexican Girl, Shaken, or Uphill Mountain, where he and his band would splinter the floorboards, allowing me to shake the dust from my cowgirl boots.\n\nWhile seeming to sidestep the pop sensibilities for more emotional heartfelt and wholly personal numbers, let me assure you, the songs do not come off as lazy. These songs are rather more introspective and delicately intricate, filled with smooth harmonies that seem effortless and sincere. Certainly there are a couple of tracks that come off in the spirit of internalized letters, never meant to be sent, and perhaps shouldnt have been but to music, but they have been, making me feel that hes reached that age when one is able to look both backwards and forward at the same time, in the same instant, seeing who one is, and trying to figure out how to move on with a sense of style and grace.\n\nTheres a straight forward delivery to Back To Birth, with the album feeling as if its something hes been working towards for a very long time  attempting to put the pieces together, both for his life and for the album; with the fact that he hasn't gotten it just right making it all that much more personal and sincere. Even Jackie admits that the songs are fragile, saying Theres a subtext to the whole record, a connecting tissue holding these songs together. One of those threads was the passing of his father in 2011, and to whom the album is dedicated, so that would certainly explain his feelings of honesty and mortality, where hes stepped into his own world, now being measured by his own standards rather than those of his parents, an issue we all come to deal with sooner or later.\n\nThis is an album where the lyrics matter, its a private record, best enjoyed in those moments without distraction, when you are beholding to no one.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","classification":4,"fold":1}
{"text":"When I was a kid, this was a treasured item in our house hold. This is essentially an album of a radio documentary broadcast on WMCA radio in New York as a tribute to JFK shortly after the assassination. Substantial segments of his speeeches and interviwes are provided with good narration to tie it all together.\n\nAs a child born exactly one year, one month, one day, and one hour (December 23, 1964) after JFK's murder, my father would occasionally play this on the stereo at home and this turned me on to JFK. Even at that age, I somehow understood the challenge of his inauguration, the call to put men on the moon, the urging for peace in 63, and the Civil Rights speech in particular spoke to me then and sends chills up my spine today.\n\nOnly complaint-this needs to be on CD. Use this to teach the younguns about JFK.","classification":5,"fold":1}

I consider it on par with other releases within, roughly, the last 15 years or so, sounding timeless when, say you alternate 1 song from this album in-between a  'time out of mind\",\"tempest\",or \"Love and Theft\" track. It Compliments all previous album releases  while carving it's own \"secret reserve\" vibe, making it that more enjoyable for one with their ears open. I've been a fan of Dylan for 21 years now, and even though I've only seen him 6 times live so far, I do own his cd\/record catalog and treasure him as an artist. Having said that, I give this album ten out of ten stars if possible, and for comparisons sake, I give \"Tempest\" a 7 out of 10. I was hesitant to even buy this album I'm ashamed to say, because I just wasn't  feeling what I was reading about the album being covers, Sinatra's playground, and all that mess.

With Rufus Taylor taking over the skins, it may be time for a live album (in the 1970s & 80s rock bands usually released one every 4 studio albums), but anyway a great slice of classic rock & excellent album cover to boot.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"The album 'Hearts' by America is the last generally popular album by the band\/\n\nIt is a very nice album to listen to, featuring mostly their folk pop. There are a lot of nice folky ballad with beautiful melodies. Dan Peek, especially, is talented at writing gorgeous, fragile melodies. It's not an uneven album at all, most of the songs are about as good as eachother, although I think those last two, 'Tomorrow' and the highly orchestrated 'Seasons' would be my pick, with that exuberant trumpet and vivacious strings I feel as though I'm in spring garden full of flowering plants and colourful birds and animals.\n\n'Hearts' is also somewhat of a transition album from the purely folk sounding album to a sound where they experiment more with arrangements and different styles; after all, they had George Martin at their disposal. 'Woman Tonight' is their first attempt at reggae, and while this genre isn't best suited to them, this is a nice song.\n\nWhile Hearts is one of their best albums, I would instead recommend buying the five pack \"Original Album Series\", which includes their first five albums, which is their best period of music(Including the entire \"Hearts\" album). It should be within most peoples' budget, and contains almost all of their biggest hits, as well as many brilliant album tracks that you may have never heard, and will probably be glad to discover. I would also recommend buying the album \"Hideaway\", which is fairly cheap to buy by itself, and contains a few songs essential to the America cannon.\nFor a little bit more than the price of most 'greatest hits' compilations, you will have all their hits except \"You can do Magic\" and \"Border\" and ALL their very best songs.","classification":4,"fold":1}

The pressing is superb; quiet, flat, and free of groove noise\/ticks\/pops, etc. Hats off to Warner's - their vinyl always seems to be extremely well-pressed & quiet, and this LP certainly fits that description.","classification":5,"fold":1}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this cd, had high hopes. Bought the deluxe version for the extra tracks and immediately put it in my truck. The sound is what i have always loved from 3DD, heavy base drums, good guitar, riffs etc .. but even after weeks of listening i just don't find myself actually liking any of the songs or wanting to hear them when i get in the truck.\nthe test comes after that first week when i punch back over to the radio or my phone or whatever .. do i catch myself thinking about track number .. whatever .. and wanting to hear it? .. well, i didnt.\nafter a week sitting in the player i had forgotten all about it .. i ran it through again and even though i knew the words to a few tracks now, i just wasn't feeling it .. i would normally say something like \"uninspired\" or something like that, but i know these guys don't just put down music for no reason .. so all i can say is that i am not feeling it.\npulled it out friday to put the new Saving Abel in and the final test was that none of the songs from this disc made their way over to my ipod .. it went on the shelf with all my other 3DD discs and will probably stay there .. first and only release of theirs not represented in my ipod at the moment .. disappointed.\nits not bad music .. its good rock .. just nothing exceptional or memorable for me.. not what i had hoped for ..","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"I vividly remember when I first saw the original movie TRON back in 1982&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tron-20th-Anniversary-Collector-s-Edition\/dp\/B00005OCMR\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)<\/a>.  I was in college and I saw it on a whim in an afternoon matinee.  I was completely amazed and hooked.  I went back and saw it again that evening, and again the following day, maybe even twice (this was back in the days before everyone had video players).  I have since watched the original 1982 TRON many, many times.  Then when the trailers and promos for TRON:LEGACY hit the screens, I started salivating.\n\nToday I saw the TRON:LEGACY soundtrack MP3 version on sale for $3.99, so I pounced on it.  I've been listening to it on and off all day and I have to say that two things have struck me.  First of all, it is heavy electronica, but not overbearing.  That is appropriate given the nature of the film it supports.  Secondly, it is engaging but not overpowering music, though in a few tracks here and there the music really drives!\n\nYou need to know up front that many of the tracks are quite similar to each other, but that also makes sense since this music provides the background for a world inside the web, where electronics are everything.  And, the music provides a consistency of place and environment that I look forward to experiencing in the movie.\n\nI have been a fan of electronica-focused music since I started listening to the Alan Parsons Project (APP) in the late 1970s (I am still a fan and APP music appears regularly on my playlists).  If you like APP and the original movie TRON, I think I can say with a pretty high degree of confidence that you will like this soundtrack.  Now, with that said, you are not likely to hear any of these instrumental tracks anyplace other than during the movie or on this album.  There are no chart-climbers here.  Even so, I am extremely glad that I purchased this album.  It is enjoyable, listenable, and makes me look forward to the theatrical release of TRON:LEGACY even more.\n\n5 stars for fans of electronica (e.g, APP) and TRON\n4 stars for most everyone else\n\nBTW - my teenaged sons and I plan to watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tron-20th-Anniversary-Collector-s-Edition\/dp\/B00005OCMR\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)<\/a>&nbsp;immediately before we head to the theater to see TRON:LEGACY later this month.

{"text":"While it would be untrue to say that \"NOW What!?!\" is my favorite Deep Purple album, I still enjoyed it and found the musicianship to be outstanding, particularly from Steve Morse who plays off Don Airey's keyboards brilliantly, and is one of the most expressive guitarists I have ever heard across numerous musical styles. Of course Roger Glover's bass and Ian Paice's drums provide a powerhouse backbone for the band, and while Ian Gillian doesn't have the ability to reach the highest highs that he did decades ago he's still amazingly versatile. The writing here is very good overall with a couple of standouts (I'm partial to \"Aprs Vous\" and \"All the Time in the World\"), and the collection as a whole works cohesively in several different genres. I was appreciative of the homage paid to the late, great Purple keyboardist Jon Lord who died a year before this was released, particularly \"Uncommon Man\". This is enjoyable listening and while faithful to their roots, the progressive hand of producer Bob Ezrin (famous for producing Pink Floyd's epic \"The Wall\") sometimes manifests itself in subtle ways. If you are a Deep Purple fan you should like this; if you're new to the group this might not be the best album to introduce you (try \"Machine Head\" or \"Burn\" instead).","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"It is honestly and absolutely so sad whenever someone young and talented passes away, that we really have felt like we have enjoyed their music beyond a lifetime and the heart has shown it. Maurice White has been one of those brilliant singers that has stood beyond the stars as the main anchor of Earth, Wind & Fire for generations, and really made a remarkable imprint in what beautiful music is absolutely like from Funk, Soul, and a brilliance in what R&B music definitely sounded like over the years. Now with his passing, a huge whole in great music has been cast and that shadow will never be filled. One of Earth, Wind & Fire's greatest songs, After The Love Has Gone is really one of those remarkable ballads that truly has stood the test of time, as a intimate ode and a sentimental love that really does kindle flames and move souls beyond the stratosphere. I have loved this song for years, and now I am reminded of what sadness is with the passing of Maurice White.

{"text":"Disappointing.  Thats a one word summary of P.O.D.s latest offering, The Awakening.  There are several reasons for this.  First and foremost is that their signature sound is largely gone.  They sound like a thousand other modern hard rock bands out there, and theres much less spit and fire (dont read this to be saying theres none).  The music is fine, but generic, and obvious (take a listen to This Goes Out To You or Criminal Conversations and tell me thats not true).  This is most certainly a guitar driven album and there are heavy tracks and sounds throughout but the tempos are often slow and sometimes plodding (smack in the middle is Somebodys Trying To Kill Me, ).  I like some of the guitar tones that Curiel finds, like the ominous air raid siren sounds on the first track Am I Awake and guitars are crisp and clear throughout; thats a plus.  Bernardos drumming is perhaps some of his best and he and Daniels rhythm section cant be faulted overly much.  Its the overall typical structure to the songs themselves that are at fault.  Verse-chorus-verse-breakdown-chorus-chorus.  There is also a glaring misfire on the album: after seven fairly hard and heavy songs track eight comes in with an awkward and not convincing lounge sound.  Its completely out of the blue and doesnt make sense in the overall concept of the album, lyrically or otherwise.  Want It All (track eight) is not a good song and whoever let this sneak onto the album should be fired.  Sonny does manage to slip in a very slight reggae sound on Revolucion but its bland, almost tacked on.  Ive liked some of his other ragga saturated sounds\/songs but not this one.\n\nAnother problem with this album is that its a concept album and doesnt carry its concept well at all.  P.O.D. has been a band that has made bold and proclamative statements in the past, worn their hearts on their sleeve, and even made challenging statements through songs (anyone remember the dust-up over their final track off of Murdered Love?).  What are they saying here in this story that they carry?  Ultimately, perhaps, it is that a son forgives his father.  The concept is conveyed in a straighter fashion in sound clips and an audio narrative that is attached to either the beginning or ending (or bothmore on this later) of each song.  The main character, a fractured young man who may be losing his mind, has a lot of heavy things that weigh on his mind: current political upheaval; moral and religious quandaries; illicit affairs; drugs; and crime (theres a point on track seven where we get to hear him vomit and wretchlovely).  We don't know where hes going and theres no obvious point of seeing the light\/ conversion but all of the sudden hes confronting his abusive father and tells him that he forgives him (narrated in the last track, The Awakening).  This conclusion comes out of nowhere!  Did we miss several songs?  The songs themselves draw out the story but don't add anything significant to it with perhaps the lead off track being the exception.  Am I Awake builds with lots of interesting sound bites thrown at us.\n\nMy last problem with the album is not that they put in sound bites and narrative into the songs themselves, its that they did it with every single song.  They either loaded the beginning of the song or the end of the song (and often both) with these narrative pieces.  These are parts of the song but they are usually not the song itself.  If you just wanted to listen to the song itself and ditch the narrative portion (which would work for all of the songs save the opening track) you don't have that option.  I wish that they had tracked most of these separately.  It ultimately detracts from being able to enjoy the song as a song only.  This IMO was a big gaff.\n\nI really like P.O.D. and was excited for this release (therefore I experienced greater disappointment).  I want them to do well.  But though I really like Am I Awake and like Rise of NWO and The Awakening I cant in all honesty recommend the release.  Ive listened to it four times top to bottom and have liked it less with each listen.  So I see that they are still following a formula of good release then bad release since Satellite.  Heres looking forward to the next one as it should be a good release, that is, if these guys haven't lost what makes them special.  A disappointing 2.75 stars.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Almost 50 years into his musical career, and Bob Dylan still finds ways to enter unchartered territory (sort of) for him. Yes indeed, only 6 months after releasing the okay-but-not-super \"Together Through Life\" album now comes Bob Dylan's first Christmas album ever.\n\n\"Christmas In the Heart\" (15 tracks; 43 min.) is a collection of traditional Christmas songs, no new Dylan-penned material here. And that is not a slight, as Dylan has shown us that he loves bringing us the tradition of American music (Dylan-style Americana). But how do you bring Christmas songs into Americana without destroying the very psyche of these Christmas tunes? And that's where the problem arises. When listening to this, I wasn't sure whether to laugh or to cry, and instead simply scratched my head, incredulous at what I was hearing. Not helpful in this context is Bob's voice. While his low-fi singing doesn't deter (and in fact enhances) his last couple of studio albums, it simply doesn't work on here, as Bob's voice has the finesse of a bull in a china shop.\n\nIf I had to point to some highlights on here, I'll go with \"Here Comes Santa Claus\", \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing\", and best of all \"O' Come All Ye Faithfull (Adeste Fideles)\", with Bob singing the first few lines in the original Latin words. Worst of all on here for me is \"\"Must Be Santa\", with is brought at breakneck speed, sort of like a freightrain barrelling down the tracks. Bottom line, I have no idea what Dylan really expected to bring with this album. Far superior to this album instead was Dylan's 2006 Christmas special on his XM radio show called \"Dylan's Rockin' Xmas\", in which Dylan brought a fantastic mix of Christmas trivia, stories, jokes and a whole bunch of Christmas-related r&b, ska, garage rock and tex-mex tunes.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"The rating I give is based on how much I like the song.  My opinion\n\nI don't really understand how one can objectively review a song.  It's entirely a matter of opinion, and a review of a song is basically pointless.  I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.\n\nBut youtube exists now.  It's not like you need to base your purchase on what other people think.  You listen to the song, and if you like it enough to want it on your mp3 player (or in better quality than youtube)... (or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.\n\nI guess I'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review...

{"text":"I hadn't even realized that the powerhouse group Chicago had done a Christmas album.  This is a great album by one of the best bands in the world.  Their treatment of some of the classic Christmas songs is typical Chicago style.  Their muscial stylings are not at all hampered by limitations of the seasonal music as one reviewer suggests.  Track #18 \"A Childs Prayer\" is so sweetly performed.  You'd think a band like this wouldn't be able to play something like it without overdoing it.  The songs that Chicago chose to place on this album tell me that this is not just a performance album.  Rather, Christmas has a certain meaning to the members of Chicago.\n\nI believe this should definately become part of your holiday music library.  It's Christmas music with a jolt.

{"text":"It's Too Late to Stop Now released in 1974 was a double 12-vinyl album showcasing the best moments distilled from three live performances on Van's 1973 world tour with his Caledonian Soul Orchestra: at The Troubadour in LA, the Santa Monica Civic and the great Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London. To many people ITLtSN was the greatest live-performance album of all time, by any artist.\n\nNow after 42 years, we finally get volumes 2, 3 & 4 plus a 50-minute DVD of the performance at The Rainbow (and how young, lean and 1970s they all look!). All this material is previously unreleased and to the same high standard as that on Vol 1, mastered from the original 2-inch analog tapes and mixed with great skill by Guy Massey. Why it has taken over 40 years for this fabulous music to be released is almost beyond belief.\n\nVan and his CSO band had soul, and they rock. The presence of brass and strings in the line-up endows the music with a depth and subtlety rare in live rock\/jazz from the period, or indeed any period. The overall soundscape is redolent of Vans 1968 masterpiece Astral Weeks.\n\nThe DVD of the Rainbow concerts on 23 & 24 July 1973 is particularly enjoyable, with this superb band pulling out all the stops and delivering an epic performance including Brown Eyed Girl, Moondance and Cypress Avenue. Van is on top form and in fine voice centre-stage, and we also see the rest of the CSO ensemble. NB the third audio CD in the collection also features different material from these Rainbow concerts, but the very best is on the DVD.\n\nVan has had a long and illustrious career as composer\/performer spanning many genres and has played with many bands, but this 1973 epoch was possibly his finest hour. That it has taken so long for this treasure to be released is a crime against music, but at last we have it. Enjoy.","classification":5,"fold":1}

The lyrics are very juvenile and uncreative, and musically, just noisy feedback that lasts for 15 minutes a track.\n\nThe only song I like off this album is 'These Three Things'.  I really didn't even care for September Sun, reminds me of Adam Sandler's song that he sang to Drew Barrymore in the movie \"Wedding Singer\". This is the first TON album that I can honestly say that I do not like.  I only like one song off the album, and even then its not what I call a radio friendly hit.\n\nSorry Peter and Crew, but your not getting any younger, and the music isn't getting better.

{"text":"I can remember owning this album when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?\n\nTo stay on topic with this album, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this album by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.\n\nAfter gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.\n\nOn the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this album 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.\n\nA MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):\n\nI have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.\n\nIf you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as \"You're just jealous!\" or \"I'd like to see you do better!\" or \"How is it in your parents' basement?\" or \"You must jerk off to your computer!\" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:\n\n\"Anyone who doesn't like what I like, and who dares to say that they don't like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!\"\n\nFYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!\n\nIf you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.\n\nTo those of you who would call me \"pretentious\" or \"music snob\" or \"self-righteous\" or \"self-absorbed,\" you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is \"simple,\" (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:\n\n\"Devil's Night Out\" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones\n\"Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols\" by The Sex Pistols\n\"The Essential Heart\" by Heart\n\"Highway To Hell\" by AC\/DC\n\"Meat Is Murder\" by The Smiths\n\"The Strange Case Of...\" by Halestorm\n\"Greatest Hits\" by Tom Petty\n\"Complete Greatest Hits\" by The Cars\n\"Ugly\" by Life of Agony\n\"Remain In Light\" by Talking Heads\n\nAs far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this album used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!\n\nI also wish to point out that arguments such as \"Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!\" or \"You can actually sing along and\/or dance to it!\" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)","classification":1,"fold":1}

{"text":"I have always been a blues guitar fan.\nThe guitar has always been my favorite instrument to listen to.\nOver the years I have not listened to a lot of Jazz. I do appreciate a good jazz musician though, and Benson is one of them.\nThe first time I heard the CD, years ago when it first came out.\nI could not believe my ears. The Sound was incredible and the guitar was exquisite. i truely wish there were more jazz guitar players with this kind of talent. If there were I would probably listen to jazz as much as I do the blues.\nGeorge Benson has come up with a very fine album.\nThis is one of those albums you play at night while you are in bed and listening to music. I often listen to music at night and I love the mood this artist gets you into.\nThis Masquerade which was written by Leon Russel and was a major hit for Benson. This to me is the classic Jazz album of all time. This is the master with his grammy winning album. Need I say more?\nThe album is very good from the first note to the last note.\nWe simply do not have enough jazz guitar players around, and an album like this proves it.................","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Hard to believe that today really is Whitney Houston's birthday, and she would've been 54 years old. Musically, she is one of the greatest divas in the world, that has shown that true beauty is solely from the voice within. She showcased a amazing bravado at the heart of the matter. But overall, she died at a very young age. But if there is one thing that I have known about Whitney, is that unlike other divas of today, her voice really reached from the deepest inner soul, something that I still adore today, much more than today's divas like Rihanna or Beyonce' Knowles that are products, not people. It also is the 25th anniversary of The Bodyguard soundtrack, the biggest selling soundtrack in the world, that absolutely defined a era of the music, the 1990's. I absolutely adore all of the songs Whitney Houston performed on the soundtrack, and Run To You is absolutely no exception. The song is absolutely beautiful & soulful from Whitney's vocals, each time I hear the song. It truly is astonishing & beautiful. It really is that high of the top tier, as is the case with I Will Always Love You & any other ballad Whitney had recorded over the years. It truly is a lovely opus that is worth any listener's ear that really strikes the essence of beauty. This is one Whitney Houston song I sincerely recommend listening to.\n\nWhitney Houston: 1963-2012\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Snoop Dogg stated recently that if Rap had not been invented, he would have become a funk\/soul singer similar to Rick James. His new Pharrell-produced album \"Bush\" finds him singing in a gentle croon, right from opening breezy ballad \"California Roll\" featuring Stevie Wonder on harmonica and harmonies, as well as Pharrell. \"This City\" is a bouncy eighties sounding groove with a rapped bridge, while \"R U A Freak\" is more melancholic but with a killer groove and lyrics declaring himself \"a squirrel just trying to get a nut\" - my favourite track. The funky \"Awake\" finds him rendering a spoken\/sung delivery with some Chic-style guitar.\n\nThe brilliant \"So Many Pros\" continues that eighties groove with a Gap Band vibe, while \"Peaches N Cream\" features Gap Band member Charlie Wilson (his distinctive vocals actually feature on 4 other tracks) and finds Snoop rapping again. \"Edibles\" takes the tempo down and features T.I. rapping to the languid groove, while \"I Knew That\" is a summery groove with a disco vibe. The quirky upbeat \"Run Away\" features Gwen Stefani. Closing cut \"I'm Ya Dogg\" is a haunting ballad featuring Kendrick Lamar and Rick Ross (both providing the only other rapping on the album), mellow and soothing.\n\nThe album has a retro feel and everything is catchy, a fun party record. Coming on the heels of his Reggae album released as Snoop Lion, Snoop has delivered one of the best R&B albums of the year.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"The Beatles compilation The Beatles 1967-1970 a\/k\/a The Blue Album was first released in April of 1973.\nIt is hard to pick the best of The Beatles' work and compile into one collection. The first attempt was in 1973 with the two double albums The Beatles 1962-1966 (see review) and The Beatles 1967-1970 (which this review pertains to). Then there were the poor one disc attempts to make a single best of The Beatles classics with such best ofs as The Beatles 20 Greatest Hits and Beatles 1 which, in my view, pale in comparison to the Red and Blue 2-disc best ofs. When the Red and Blue best-ofs came out, The Beatles had been disbanded since 1970 and its members (which were singer\/songwriter\/rhythm guitarist John Lennon, singer\/songwriter\/bass player Paul McCartney, singer\/guitarist George Harrison and singer\/drummer Ringo Starr) were now solo superstars but when they were together they were responsible for changing music much more than Elvis did.\nThe first disc covers tunes from the band's two 1967 albums Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (represented by its title cut, \"With a Little Help From My Friends\", \"Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds\" and the classsic \"A Day in the Life\"). Its followup in December of 1967 called Magical Mystery Tour (which is represented by the singles \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" (a UK #1) and \"Penny Lane\" (a US #1) plus the other singles from 1967 \"All You Need Is Love\" (a US #1 in 1967) and \"Hello Goodbye\" (which hit #1 in the US in 1967). There's also the title cut to Magical Mystery Tour, Paul's \"The Fool On the Hill\" and John's masterpiece \"I Am the Walrus\"). Then we end the first disc three singles from 1968. First is the single penned by Paul called \"Lady Madonna\" then one of the best double A-sides ever \"Hey Jude\" which was penned by Paul and a huge #1 hit and of course John's rocker \"Revolution\".\nDisc two picks up with more from 1968 with three from The White Album which is represented by \"Back In the USSR\", \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"Oblidi Oblada\". Then we go to 1969 two double A-sides. First is Paul's #1 hit \"Get Back\" and John's masterpiece \"Don't Let Me Down\". Then another out of John's \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" and George's \"Old Brown Shoe\". The band's final album Abbey Road is represented by four great tracks. First is John's rocker \"Come Together\", George's classics \"Something\" (a #1 hit) and \"Here Comes the Sun\" and lastly Ringo's \"Octopus' Garden\". We close with the 1970 single mix of \"Let it Be\" and then two tracks from the controversially re-produced by Phil Spector Let it Be album out of \"Across the Universe\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\" (the band's final #1 single).\nThe Beatles 1967-1970 would top out at #1 on the US charts and sell millions and is their second highest selling album in US sales.\nIn 2010, the album is re-released in a newly remastered version superbly remastered at Abbey Road packaged in a digi-pak which looks similar to the original LP and also comes with a booklet with extra photos, an essay and full lyrics. Like the 1993 re-release, it is a 2-CD set but is much cheaper than the 1993 re-issue which was insanely charged high.\nRECOMMENDED!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"There are so many reasons why I call R. Kelly the undisputed King Of R&B. One of them being the fact that the man's talent is unmatched in this ever changing music industry. Weather we are talking about his exceptional vocals, or his amazing swagger, or his ability to make every track he's a part of his own track. Another reason I call him the King of R&B, is because he is a true musician in every sense of the word. He writes, produces, sings, and plays instruments on all of his own records. He rarely lets other people produce or write for him, with the exception of his last album Untitled, and his '98 record R. And not only does he produce\/write the majority of his own music, he also does so for other artists ranging from the legendary Michael Jackson to the lesser know R&B singer Joe. And another thing that has to be acknowledged about R.Kellys resume, is that he has been able to maintain relevance for almost 20 years, and not only maintain that relevance, but also dominate the R&B genre for almost that entire time. He helped change R&B into what it is today. Without R. Kelly, there wouldn't be any Usher's, or Chris Brown's, or Trey Songz's. R. Kelly paved the way for all of those artists, and not only that but he's also sold 40 million records and had a over 20 hit singles along the way. Needless to say, R. Kelly is easily the best modern day R&B singer of our time. He's like the new Marvin Gaye, which R. Kelly considers Marvin to be one of his biggest influences, and some would argue that Kells is better. He's won Grammy's, Soul Train Awards, Lifetime Achievement Awards, graced covers of several magazines, produced his own mini movie... I mean honestly, what has the guy not done in his 20 year stint in this entertainment business?\n\nOne of the things that I admire most about R. Kelly, is his diversity. He is such a unique artist that has so many different sides to his musical genius that it almost make it hard to tell what kind of artist he truly is. I mean obviously he is a bonafide R&B singer, and there is no doubt about that. But the thing I love about R. Kelly, and this is probably one of the biggest reason's why he's been able to stay relevant all these years, is that he is always changing. And I don't know if \"Changing\" is really the right word im looking for, but he is always tweeking and adding different styles to his craft. Like I said there are so  many sides to R. Kelly's artistry, there's the partying \"Ignition\" and \"Fiesta\" R. Kelly, there's the club goer \"I'm A Flirt\" and \"Supaman High\" R. Kelly, there's the sentimental \"I Wish\" and \"I'm Your Angel\" R. Kelly, there's the inspirational \"I Believe I Can Fly\" and \"World's Greatest\" R. Kelly, there's the Thug \"Double Up\" and \"Playa's Only\" R. Kelly, and my personal favorite baby making time \"Echo\" and \"Bump and Grind\" R. Kelly... And of course there's the strait up, what I like to call the Loverman side of R. Kelly, which was mostly shown on his Chocolate Factory album, and now Love Letter as well... Like I said, the man is very versatile...Which is why he is probably my favorite artist of all time. It's because every one of his albums is different from the last or has a completely different theme than the last. R. was his radio ready breakthrough record, TP-2.com was his strait up baby maker, Chocolate Factory was a love album, Happy People\/U Saved Me was stepper's music\/gospel, Double Up was a hip hop record, and Untitled was a collage of contemporary R&B. Now I'm not saying that those album's are strictly in those themes, obviously it can vary a little bit, but generally speaking his albums do tend to have a specific theme for the most part.\n\nNow if I had to compare Love Letter to any of his previous albums, it would be without a doubt in my mind compared to the love album Chocolate Factory. As a matter of fact, after the first listen to Love Letter, I was calling it the poor man's Chocolate Factory, because sonically and lyrically, both of the album's have the same warm, lovey, romantic vibe. With Love Letter he does have a strong throwback 60's\/70's soul vibe, which was only sprinkled on Chocolate Factory, where as with Love Letter the throwback vibe does tend to dominate a little more, which is why the album is garnering strong reviews most likely. The problem with Love Letter, and what's keeping it from being a classic like Untitled, is that although it is nice and refreshing to hear that 70's  throwback style today among all the pop\/r&b thats dominating the charts today, Love Letter does drag a little bit and at times kind of starts to sound bland and a bit out dated. I'm not saying its a bad album or even sub par, but it's not one of his best albums. I understand what he was trying to accomplish with this album, but there's just not many songs at all on the album that have that aggressive, carnal tones that have made R the legend he is today. R. Kelly has always been known for his raunchy overly sexual baby makers, which is where he most successful and most dominant. And for me personally, the baby makers are my personal favorites from R. Kelly, because he does them the best...But there is little to none of that on Love Letter. Much like Chocolate Factory, on Love Letter the song's that do have any sort sexuality, which isn't much at all, but when there is that little bit of sexuality it's more in the form of romance than the typical raunchy style R. Kelly brings most of the time. Like on loud and roaring \"Taxi Cab\" or the mellow slow jam \"Lost In Your Love\", which are both standouts. But where R. Kelly really dominates on this album is the throwback soul slow jams, like on the smooth title track, and the old school \"When A Woman Love\", and on the groovy slow jam \"Number One Hit\", he compares his the love of his woman to that joy of a number one hit. \"Number One Hit\" sounds sooooo much like a track from Chocolate Factory that I almost wondered if it might have been from the Chocolate Factory sessions, the way he just smoothly glides across the mellow instrumental. It's for sure one of the standout cuts from the album, along with the catchy desperate I Want You Back anthem \"Radio Message\". And Mr. Kelly also does a pretty great cover of MJ's \"You Are Not Alone\", which isn't surprising since he wrote and produced the track for MJ. Overall, it's not a surprise that this album is getting the great reviews it is, and it will likely be looked at as a comeback record for R. Kelly even though he has never really left, as his last album Untitled was also great, but it was also a completely different style. The thing that will win a lot of people over with this record is it's soulfulness, and its throwback 70's soul vibe, which is rare these days from contemporary R&B singers...It's not his best record, and I definitely do prefer Untitled over this one, but it is still a strong album...But if anyone can pull off this type of style change, it would be the extremely versatile Mr R. Kelly!\n\nGrade:\nC+","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Angels & Airwaves continues forward with their 80s-tinged blending of punk vocals, anthemic and chest-beating U2 choruses, and the guitar shadings and conceptual nature of classic Pink Floyd. All in all, some of my favorite musical touchstones that have been part of the soundtrack to my life.\n\n\"Call To Arms\" opens in classic AvA style, widescreen and epic, beautiful chiming guitars and pulsing keyboards building up into a huge song with big choruses and gorgeous Hammond organ.\n\n\"Everything's Magic\" has become sort've \"our song\" between my girlfriend and I. I heard it for the first time just days before we met, and it was played quite a bit in the car during our first few months. Everytime we hear it come on in a department store or the mall, we give eachother this look and a smile that is priceless. There's a nice pop-punk quality to it (which is different from anything on their first album), although the chorus is a pure adrenaline rush reminescent of early Asia.\n\n\"Love Like Rockets\" is another \"classic AvA\" song, with those trademark sequenced keyboards and drums. The intro is perfectly epic, utilising sound samples of President Eisenhower, astronauts, and various radio chatter and feedback that brings to mind the Space Race of the 50's and 60's. Tom seems to be making a parallel between the giddy rush of new love, and launching on a rocket into an unknown frontier.\n\n\"Breathe\" is sort've a ballad with nice soft keyboards. \"Sirens\" is fast-paced and frenetic and the chorus reminds me of The Proclaimers. \"Secret Crowds\" has a huge chorus, although I love the music and words during the verses a bit more. \"Star of Bethlehem\/True Love\" was originally recorded for a compilation CD in late 2006, and is mixed a little differently on I-Empire. Another mini-epic, with trancey sequencers and Edge-like guitar effects. \"Lifeline\" has a keyboard sound that immediately brought me fresh memories of 1985, considering that it sounded exactly like the intro to Reading Rainbow.\n\n\"Jumping Rooftops\" is a cut-and-pasted percussion and keyboard interlude that leads into \"Rite of Spring\", which is another relatively experimental song, sounding more raw and punky as Tom reflects on his teenage life. (He said that he wanted to write a song that would sound like a garage band's first tune, written in high school.) The album ends with \"Heaven\", reprising musical and lyrical themes from \"Valkyrie Missile\", the opening track on We Don't Need To Whisper, effectively ending the two-album concept and bringing things full circle.\n\nThe lyrics continue in the same vein of We Don't Need To Whisper, and are positively infectious in their optimistic spiritual outlook, topics of reformation and reinvention, living your dreams, and never giving up. This is a message that I wish more Top 40 bands would preach, and is vastly needed during the hard times we live in. Being a grounded but optimistic person myself (as well as having a love for the 80's, Sci-Fi, and prog-rock), this band is perfect blend of my favorite things.\n\nOverall, I-Empire sounds quite a bit like their last album, although has a couple of curveballs and is a little more organic sounding. New bassist Matt Wachter (formerly of 30 Seconds To Mars) and guitarist David Kennedy don't stand out too much (being buried behind layers of effects and keyboards, not to mention Tom's own playing), but drummer Atom Willard continues with greatness previously seen before, with a fiery, explosive energy, awesome fills, and a rhythmic groove that very nearly puts him in the \"virtuoso\" category. Check out his electronic\/acoustic percussion showcase throughout the first few minutes of \"Star of Bethlehem\/True Love\" (notably performed just as perfect in a live setting when I caught the band live in early 2008.)\n\nThe album artwork is a departure from the last one, instead featuring a painted montage (by Drew Struzan, famous movie poster artist of Lucas and Spielberg) of the band over a sunset horizon. Yet another reference to a positive 80's childhood.\n\nIf AvA fans can't get enough of this type of sound, I'd strongly recommend some other prog-rock bands such as Pendragon (Believe or Pure), 30 Seconds To Mars, It Bites (The Tall Ships or The Big Lad In The Windmill), Rush (Grace Under Pressure or Power Windows), dredg, Coheed & Cambria and Asia.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"With their record contracts with Pye and Reprise being expired in 1971, The Kinks\n  felt free to pursue a new recording contract that led them to secure a record deal with\n  RCA Records which resulted with the release of this highly accomplished album later\n  that year. Officially billed as a definition to the bands crossover albums from the late-\n  1960s, Muswell Hillbillies successfully repeated the influences of Music Hall with the\n  traditional American stylings of country music and bluegrass well thrown in to careful\n  well-structured effect as it focuses the alienation of the working man and takes place\n  at Muswell Hill, a London suburb where Ray and Dave Davies were brought up while\n  it contain songs which focuses on working class life and again, on Davies childhood.\n  With the superlative music brilliantly composed by Ray and performed by the band to\n  utmost empathy, the track set starts off with the supercharged hit single 20th Century\n  Man as it concludes merrily with heart and sensibility on other songs, including Acute\n  Schizophrenia, Paranoia Blues, Holiday, Skin And Bone, Here Come The People In\n  Grey, Have A Cuppa Tea and Muswell Hillbilly (Alcoholic and Skin And Bone are the\n  most atypical classics in The Kinks catalogue).  As one of the bands finest and most\n  beloved masterworks, Muswell Hillbillies was greeted with critical acclaim but started\n  out as a fair accomplishment on the charts upon its official release, then its success\n  soon caught on.  And what made the album as appealing is the album cover that was\n  taken at The Archway Tavern as it shows the band below a signpost giving directions\n  to Muswell Hill which add to the albums truly unforgettable epitomized successone\n  that will remain a captivatingly outright and astonishing work of art. Plus you will hear\n  the albums radio commercial which just wraps up the remastered finishing touch.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Alice Cooper-Zipper Catches Skin **1\/2\n\nThe way I look at most of Alice Coopers releases from the early to mid 1980's is the same way I look at Iggy Pop's work form the same time period. None of it is really horrible (at least not completely) but none of it is really great. They both seem to have like the whole new wave thing and wanted to join in on it. It didn't work out well for either of them. But what blows my mind is they were maybe the two most original front men in the history of rock n' roll and yet they wanted to do something...bad..? because lets be honest they must have been the only ones who thought the genre was going to last because once it stopped they both kept making new wave music.\n\n'Zorro's Ascent' 'No Baloney Homosapiens' 'I Like Girls' and 'Tag, Your It' are all decent rock tracks. They have typical Cooper charm in the lyrics. Especially 'No Baloney...' but none of them are worthy of the Alice Cooper name. Though 'Remarkably Insencire' is a real gem.\n\nThe rest of the album feels trite and boring, not to mention that Cooper sounds like he is bored with the music. The production for one thing is horrendous.\n\nWhile not too bad and not a total waste of your money, Zipper Catches Skin is not an album worth hunting down. IF you happen to come across it yeah it makes a cool snag, but ditch the high hopes for this one.","classification":3,"fold":1}

Nice Alt. song w\/peaking vocals & strong sound. Very nice 5 minutes although repeating same line to end gets old fast.\n\nHome by Lights & Motion. Opening light weight bells & keyboard, sounding little seasonal (Christmas) grows in volume & content as the song progresses. Melds into nice instrumental. Like it.\n\nStorms by Accents. Lone pleasant male vocal over acoustic guitar. Singer song writer number with some minor backing. Very nice.\n\nColors In Stereo by Moonlit Sailor. Indie Pop Instrumentation, Post Rock Atmospherics per their record label. And they are correct, ambitious almost grand sound that cruises along. Enjoyable well produced, very nice.\n\nThe Lines Above Our Heads, Again For The Win. Slow, simple build w\/steady band and great lead vocal. Song opens out to quality Indie number, controlled & deliberate. Like it, very nice.\n\nUltrapop by Ethienne. Mild distorted fuzz keyboard sound, simple pop song, electro vocal over keyboards, chorus & beat. Okay.\n\nMiles by Keystone Kids. Electronic pop (stolen from record label web site) is not a bad description. Nothing special indie\/pop, you will like it.\n\nTrack 8 is Granville by The Sky Life. Male lead singer slowly keeping up with acoustic backing. Deliberate vocals that I did not care enough about to listen to. Slow s\/sw number you will love it.\n\nSleep by The Cast Before The Break. Cool mildly threatening opening on quality ambient\/indie rock song. Layered punching sounds behind superior male vocal. Very nice 6 minutes including frantic center & end. Love it.\n\nRed Lightning Child\/Great Emptiness by Coma Recovery. Another instrumental track. Strong busy track, no vocals but pounding collection of band parts that keeps your attention. Never breaks out into hard rock (to me) but easily rides the edge for the whole wave. Very nice, like it.\n\nA Different Heav'n by The Dandelion War. Lavish Atmospherics still a valid description, choral vocal over subdued not much. Little more sound starts half way through the song. You may love it.\n\nLet Us In! (Come On) by The Lions Rampant. Great garage rock sound, energy and uninhibited sound. Nothing fancy kinda punk meets The Kinks feel. Love it.\n\nHomage To Excess by Cari Clara. Straining male vocal over acoustic guitar, kinda emotional number, not for me. You may love it.\n\nLast track, Speaking For Everyone (Version II-Piano) by Athletics. Mellow piano opening (no really?) lone male vocal unwinding & growing with the song. Nice.\n\nDeep Elm included some duplicate tracks from Postrockology released couple of days ago on this sampler. All sound great as does this sampler & it's all free pointless to complain. Mostly thoughtful, smart, well produced ambient & indie songs.

If you don't already have that release, I would definitely recommend buying it before this one. It's a great set, with very fine performances of the St. Matthew Passion, the Goldberg Variations, and other major works.\nIf you do have that set, then it comes down to whether it's worth 99 cents to get Cantatas 12 & 29. It was for me. It turns out, however, that these performances have been mis-labelled. They are not conducted by Michael Gielen but--as one reviewer theorized-- by Mogens Wldike, leading a fine group of soloists (Netania Davrath, Hilde Rssel-Majdan, Anton Dermota, and Walter Berry) and the Vienna State Opera Orchestra. These are very good performances, and especially because I happen to be a big fan of Wldike, I think he and his forces should get the credit they deserve.\n\nHere's a link to the bach-canatas page, showing that Wldike made the recording in May 1960.

{"text":"Leela James  is one of those singers `deserving wider recognition.`  Unfortunately for the soulful songstress, `the right album' for commercial aspirations seems unlikely.  For the fans's sake, maybe that is best as a `soulful,' `authentic' Leela James seems much better than a commercial `pop-tart' or a contemporary R&B singer with `no soul.'  From my perspective, on her third effort (second effort of originals),<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/My-Soul\/dp\/B0034BW938\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">My Soul<\/a>, James sounds as if she has found just the right bridge between being considered too obscure and conceding too much just for commercial appeal.  On 'My Soul,' there are some cuts that could have been genuine commercial hits as well as cuts fulfilling and `ode' to soul music.  James balances two worlds with great relevance.\n\n\"I Ain't New To This\" is a superb opener, featuring great soulful production work that samples \"Solitary Love Affair\" by Millie Jackson.  The hook is simple and old school in conception, but captivates listener, foreshadowing what `gems' are to further captivate the listener on the album.  The length may be a brief 2:30, but there is more than enough substance to alert the listener this is going to be one solid album.\n\n\"So Cold\" is one of many originals written solely by James, and it does not disappoint.  Here, James contrasts her overt, soul-stirring vocals from \"I Ain't New To This\" with softer, restrained vocals, as if to represent `the coldness' of which she sings.  the production work is soulful, with full-sounding bass, lovely twinkles of piano, and tasteful use of synthesized lines.  \"The Fact Is\" keeps up the soulful vibe established by James, only another sample `buttresses' the production work, this time a contribution from soul standouts The Moments (\"Lovely Way She Loves\").  James's vocals are more present and direct here, once again contrasting the previous trend.  Lovely background vocals strengthen the well written refrain, with the sample being incredibly projected here.\n\n\"I Want It All\" changes pace once again, providing one of the albums more satisfactory listens.  Another original solely by James,  James channels funk on this throwback cut which features superb, catchy songwriting.  Here, James `wants': \"forty acres and mule... I want to do what I choose and make my own rules..\".  It is by all means an A+ cut.  \"Party All Night,\" another James original, features a nice uptempo, driving groove, again providing contrast to the previous, funky cut.  The vocals are overt by James, highlighting her almost anachronistic vocals.  Harmonically, the track sits on the same chord, contributing to the remarkableness of the groove.\n\nNo album is complete without a great duet, and co-writers Leela James and Raheem DeVaughn accomplish this on the powerful, soulful cut \"Mr. Incredible, Ms. Unforgettable.\" The sound achieved here is classic and Raheem DeVaughn and Leela James possess a remarkable vocal chemistry, reaching to soaring heights.  The momentum rises even higher with \"Tell Me You Love Me,\" a cut lifting \"Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye.\"  This cut is clearly a neo-soul number, but it is contemporary enough to appeal to younger listeners who favor more commercially-driven cuts.  \"Let It Roll\" is equally solid, if not more so, with soulful production that sounds indigenous to the 1970s.  At only 2:44, \"Let It Roll\" leaves the listener yearning for more.\n\n\"Supa Luva\" is lengthier than previous cuts, but length takes nothing away from the overall quality.  \"If It's Wrong,\" the penultimate cut, features nice dark-sounding production work, contrasting the bright, soulful edge of most of the other cuts.  Closing cut \"It's Over\" may not be the best cut of My Soul, but it redirects any lost energy via \"Supa Luva\" or \"If It's It Wrong\", which is not much lost.\n\nEssentially, 'My Soul' is a superb soul album that has unfortunately been forgot in a pack of more generic, though commercial R&B releases.  It would be nice to see Ms. James get a huge lift and receive the talent she deserves, but regardless of commercial success or lack of, Leela James is one of R&B's shining stars.  My Soul is the evidence.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"This is THE signature song of Tower of Power from 1972, and one of the most beautiful, exquisite love ballads ever written!  Heartfelt, soulful, and packed to the core with emotion. The opening horns soar gloriously, sweeping across the heavens, and then, they suddenly come crashing to a halt, as the vocals gently begin. He's in love with a woman, a few years older than he. She tells him repeatedly he's wasting his time, he's just too young for her. But he won't have it; he's a good man, he'll make her happy....no, he's not wasting his time. Someday she'll understand...just what it means when a man comes to her with his little heart in his hands! He'll never, never, never, never do her wrong....all he wants right now is just to get next to her, just to hold her, and please her. And then, as the song ends in a wound-up crescendo and stops on a dime, the final trumpet is joined by the rest of the brass section with a stunning grande finale. This composition is one of those rare ones that can truly be defined as TIMELESS....\n\n--TK","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"There is no question that today, music has honestly lost one of its brightest singers, Joe Cocker who passed away at 70 years old. He honestly was one of the greatest singers of all time, who knew how to belt out remarkable songs on his own, and doing renditions of other artists songs. He had his ups and downs with his life, but always kept music in tune. When he did another artist in song, he took it into another place like his cover of the classic Ray Charles song Un-Chain My Heart, which came out in the 1987. The song just remains a classic, and showcases his bluesy voice and a soulful heart kept alive in song and in real heart. It is truly a blessing at soul, and what he put out with great music. Joe Cocker will definitely be missed in song, and in spirit. His heart has been un-chained.\n\nJoe Cocker 1944-2014\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"The Black Angels' debut \"Passover\" was an exciting surge back to 60s psychedelia, full of mind-bending drones, trippy guitars and a truly inspired vocalist in Alex Maas. \"Direction To See A Ghost\" continues things in the same vein. Granted there isn't much new to TBA's sound, but this doesn't bother me. They have such a distinguished sound already that varying it too much after just two releases was never necessary.\n\nAs with the debut, the songs tend to flow and groove endlessly. The `drone machine' saturates everything, the drums are powerful and locked, the guitar tone is perfectly fuzzy and Maas' piercing, nasally delivery is wonderfully fitting. Some songs have the tendency to drift on, but there are some real gems here. The one-two punch of \"You On The Run\" and \"Doves\" is a grand opening, with the former setting up a brooding, melancholy Velvet Underground atmosphere, only for the latter to cut through with some feel-good, sunshine pop psychedelia. Other highlights include the sombre \"18 Years\" and the sitar-laden \"Deer-Ree-Shee\". Generally, there isn't a bad song to be found here. \"Directions\" is another great album from The Black Angels that firmly cements them at the forefront of modern psychedelic rock.","classification":5,"fold":1}

To my ignorant ear sounds more like they are battling vocals than harmonizing. Still good song.\n\nPeter Bradley Adams with My Love Is My Love. Almost morose plodding sound and vocal. Not for me.\n\nDawn Kinnard with My Favorite Ghost. Simple song and shallow vocal along with upbeat pop backing.\n\nTrack 5 is Thift Store Pollack by Merlowe and the Dry Tear. Shallow experimenting Beatles vibe, very thin vocal and sound probably should listen to more of their songs.\n\nWPA (Works Progress Administration) play Rise Up. Slow mellow strong vocal over subdued music. The singer is the song with little to say except the song title.\n\nColin Devlin plays Raise The Dead. Folk Rock sound breathy male vocal over busy sounds and real band playing slow but strong. Nice.\n\nTrack 8 is Poor Old Town by Kat Maslich Bode. Country feel on nice tune tripping along.

{"text":"First off, Sara Bareilles is a great new musical talent, in the vein of the gaggle of female pop artist dominating the airwaves today. She sings great, and her piano work is incredible. The song could be compared to REM's classic, \"The One I Love,\" in that, the title sounds, well, like a lovesong, but actually it's like a break-up song. Bareilles does a great job at creating a radio-friendly upbeat pop song. And it all seems to work. Just the other day, I heard the song twice within a span of 15 minutes, on completely different radio stations.\n\nOverall, a great little pop tune from a big talent.

{"text":"INTUITION is the follow-up to Jamie Foxx's multi-platinum 2005 effort, UNPREDICTABLE. While INTUITION isn't quite as sound as its predecessor, it is a very enjoyable album.  On INTUITION, Foxx makes more concessions to contemporary R&B and hip-hop, hence showing that he wants to stay relevant. True, Foxx is no \"young boy\" in the R&B world, but his voice and his persona sells itself in my eyes. As always, Foxx always surprises vocally, and INTUITION is no different, flat spots or raging hot spots.\n\nThe albums opens with the brilliant \"Just Like Me\" featuring T.I., which is equally as strong as 2005's mega #8 hit \"Unpredictable\".  The production work and songwriting by The-Dream and Tricky Stewart (I think) are sick as always, and Foxx is vocally on fire.  T.I.'s performance is top-notch as well, making for a solid opening statement.  \"I Don't Need It\" is produced by none other than Timbaland.  Solid and enjoyable, though not as effective as \"Just Like Me\".  However, none can deny the catchiness of the hook \"B**ch, I don't need it\", even if it is incredibly corny. But, that's our Timbaland, isn't it?\n\n\"Number One\" featuring Lil' Wayne is more enjoyable than \"I Don't Need It\" with its sick production work by Just Blaze.  Lil Wayne may be the best part of the track, though Foxx is great too. \"Digital Girl\" featuring Kanye West & The Dream is solid, though forgettable in comparison to \"Just Like Me\", \"I Don't Need It\", or the blazing \"Number One\" that precedes it.  It is enjoyable enough, but the T-Pain featured \"Blame It\" easily steals the show and reshapes the lost momentum.  \"She Got Her Own\" featuring Ne-Yo and Fabolous is a bit lengthy, but I think that the overall performance and songwriting is impeccable. Again, Shaffer \"Ne-Yo\" Smith writes another potent song.\n\nAfter a pointless interlude (\"Intuition Interlude\") Foxx gives another convincing vocal performance on \"I Don't Know\".  The production is soulful laden (given the soul sample) making for another solid performance.  A couple of tracks follow that are solid or merely average (\"Weekend Lover\", \"Why\", and \"Freakin' Me\" featuring Marsha Ambrosius of Floetry).  \"Freakin' Me\" is a bit better than the former two, but it still falls short of the best.  \"Slow\" is lengthy, but resurrects the energy of INTUITION, while \"Rainman\" is 'take it or leave it'.  The album ends strong with numbers \"Overdose\" and the fine \"Love Brings Change\".\n\nDespite the concessions to contemporary R&B, Foxx isn't always 100% effective is making INTUITION near as coherent as his Grammy nominated UNPREDICTABLE. What Foxx does do well is that he still manages to make INTUITION one of the more enjoyable R&B albums of 2008, particularly where some albums have fallen flat.  Not perfect, but above average in my eyes. 3.5 stars.","classification":4,"fold":1}

They were great.\nWith their addition to this album I prefer it to Rubber Soul without the original songs. It seems much stronger.  I didn't feel that way when I originally heard them.\nSo this is a great purchase, whereas Rubber Soul will not have songs you, like me, listened to in the Sixties.\nSo I just picked them both up.

Anyhow, B.Y.O.B by System Of A Down is a brilliant hard rock song the uses lyrics of everyone going to a party with the seriousness of a political music discussion.

It comes from the 2011 album DRIVE TIME.\n\n\"Mystery Train\" is the Elvis Sun Records classic by the Grascals from 2012's LIFE FINDS A WAY.\n\n\"That's What She Said\" is one of two tracks by the Boxcars from 2012's ALL IN. This instrumental gives the band members a chance to show of their chops.\n\n\"He Never Failed Me\" is a great gospel number from John Bowman's 2012 FAMILY CHAIN.\n\n\"Any Old Road (Will Take You There)\" is one of the best songs Gordon Lightfoot never wrote. There's some great singing and picking on this number by Balsam Range from their album PAPERTOWN.\n\n\"Jack of All Trades\" is the second of three songs featuring mandolin player Doyle Lawson. This gospel number is from 2013's SING ME A SONG ABOUT JESUS.\n\n\"Lonely Ends Where Love Begins\" is a rousing live number from Darin & Brooke Aldridge's RED, WHITE AND BLUEGRASS. [Note: The song should have been faded out earlier. Brooke introduces \"Makin' Plans\" and then that song isn't played.]\n\n\"I'm Blue\" is a great heartbreak song by Flatt Lonesome from their self-titled debut.\n\n\"Prayer Bells of Heaven\" (yes, that's the correct title) was written by Jimmy Martin and Paul Williams. This classic is performed by Paul Williams with J.D. Crowe and Doyle Lawson from the 2010 album OLD FRIENDS GET TOGETHER.\n\nThe album closes with a second track by the Boxcars from ALL IN:  \"Don't Fall in Love with a Girl Like That.\"\n\nThis collection is a nice mix of both old school and contemporary bluegrass artists. If there's a complaint, it's that it's only thirty minutes long. My solution? Press repeat and enjoy again. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Amy Winehouse's second album Back To Black is a throwback to the 60's girl group sounds.  Owing a debt to the Shangri-La's, Ms. Winehouse combines a modern lyrically approach (a liberal dose of the four letter words) with the R&B influences of those girl groups.  \"Rehab\" kicks off the album on a brassy note with Ms. Winehouse unabashedly refusing to get help for her problems with an emphatic no, no, no chorus.  \"Me & Mr. Jones\" is not a remake of the Billy Paul classic, \"Me & Mrs. Jones\", but a doo-wop inflected number.  \"You Know I'm No Good\" have a Memphis soul feel, the title track is a smoldering number with a Phil Spector Wall of Sound influence and \"Some Unholy War\" brings to mind the 60's Atlantic soul sound.  \"Tears Dry On Their Own\" basically nicks the riff from \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\", but Ms. Winehouse really gives the song a workout.  While Ms. Winehouse is obviously influenced by 60's American music, the lyrics and feel of the album are completely British.  Ms. Winehouse has a tremendous voice and a sharp pen, lets hope she'll be a force to reckon with for a long time.","classification":5,"fold":1}

I wasn't totally wild about the first single \"Song for the Lonely,\" a 9\/11 tribute that sounds less sincere than opportunistic.  She fares way better on \"A Different Kind of Love Song,\" \"The Music's No Good Without You,\" and the bouncy \"When the Money's Gone.\"  But \"Living Proof\"'s best track is the discocentric \"Love Is a Lonely Place Without You,\" a really good post-breakup song that's given justice thanks to Cher's distinguished delivery.

{"text":"For me, listening to Tame Impala's first album consistently conjured up the image of the Ayers rock, the big red mountain in the middle of the Australian outback, at sunset (or sunrise), the band playing alone and powerful and majestic on the sands in front of it.  \"Innerspeaker\" gave me a sense of isolation but in the most romantic and idealistic sense.  Tame Impala's newest release also creates a sense of isolation but thanks to the aggressive recording techniques used this time around- in your face drums, creative channel mixing (even more so than on the previous album), manipulated vocals, layers of keyboards- the isolation is a little more disturbing. \"Lonerism\" sounds exactly like you think music described as Lonerism should sound like- unlike anything else.\n  And it is genius.  Opening track \"Be Above It\" occupies a musical landscape somewhere between \"Kid A\" Radiohead and any era Animal Collective, yet it sounds like Tame Impala.  No chorus, no verse, or anything resembling structure appears to exist- it is just 3:22 of drums, distorted vocals, and psych energy.  \"Endors Toi\" kicks off with some familiar guitar sounds before veering off into symphonic rock, not too far removed from The Flaming Lips more eccentric stuff.  Yet again, it sounds like Tame Impala.  The two tracks released prior to the album's release- \"Apocalypse Dream\" and \"Elephant\"- each display two of the bands strengths.  The former is an over-the-top, upbeat, prog rocker that embraces the term 'epic' while the latter is dirty, aggressive, bass-driven blues rock.\n  The stand out track (at least for today; this will probably change next week) is \"Keep On Lying\".  It starts off with a fade-in, already in progress, sounding like a subdued, lazy \"99 Tears\".  For the first couple minutes, nothing much changes.  Then slowly, an oddly mixed guitar enters, along with chattering voices, and before you know it, the song is lost in a musical house of mirrors (and blessed with some of  the album's most exciting guitar playing).  It sounds ridiculous, but it is.  And again, it is genius.\n  Needless to say, Tame Impala has avoided a sophomore slump.  Heading in a new direction while still sounding like Tame Impala is quite an accomplishment, and also a rewarding and exhilarating listen for their fans.  And I haven't even mentioned the Led Zeppelin stomp of \"Mind Mischief\" or the fact that the last track is a piano waltz.  Genius stuff.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Yes, this was the Bee Gees 'white' album, only this doubled LP had a red velvet cover and a 'Titanic'-like illustration in the gatefold.  Now available on a single CD, it marks the end of the sixties period for the Bee Gees.\nThe music?  This was an important time for the Gibbs' who were maturing (at ages 19 and 21) and already millionaires.  The music was conceptual and starting with the title track, it delivers with powerful orchestration and emotional, lyrical simplicity.  It is a skewed look at a fabled seafarer lost at sea and emotionally destitute.  At least, that's what the project started out to be.\nSomewhere during the recordings, egos flared and tempers snapped, so what you ended up with is a collection of half Bee Gees conceptual songs and half individual Gibb contributions.  It is still a remarkable recording!\nStand-out cuts are \"Marley Purt Drive\" that could have been recorded by \"The Band\" and \"Melody Fair\", a single in some countries and a well covered track.\nMost of the other tracks deal with period issues like, drugs, sex, rock 'n roll, psychodelia and why not?  Producer Stigwood unwittingly fueled the tensions by choosing \"First Of May\" as the A-Side single instead of B-Side \"Lamplight\", which was just as strong.\nRegardless, the final outcome is a conceptual album filled with an orchestrally sweeping moodiness aligned with perfect harmonies and lyrics envied by everyone. This is one of the few albums of the period with orchestral solos with the Gibbs providing the chorus.  It is monumental.","classification":4,"fold":1}

It has been done so many times, and by so many people, but there have been a lot of faults that haven't been able to outshine others. Arguable, the biggest version of the Star Spangles, is definitely from the great Whitney Houston. Her legacy to deliver any cover, has been beyond what words could ever be ignited from the soul of the heart. Her rendition from the Super Bowl back in 1991, still ignites from the impassioned soul. Whenever I hear this version that \"The Voice\" honorably showcased, I am constantly reminded of how beautiful she still can shine, where so many singers like Beyonce' Knowles have not even came close to singing and delivering a simple note where Whitney ignited from first to last place. If you have never heard a song by the dynamic Whitney Houston, than this song is one I sincerely recommend.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"This is the only fully career-spanning collection currently in print, available in two, three, and four CD editions. I picked up the 3 CD set although I already own all but the two new songs on CD, but I got this at a great price thanks to Amazon's Black Friday music deals.\n\nThe song selection lacks some notable singles. Mother's Little Helper was a single-only release in the US and should be here. Instead we get the creepy psychedelia of We Love You which was only the B-side of Dandelion (also MIA). Of course there are fan favorites missing that many will demand inclusion, but really, this collection is for the casual fan who could care less about deep album tracks.\n\nDisc one's track order tells the compelling story of a British blues band that developed into a hit making machine. It begins with the frantic Chuck Berry cover that introduced the band to the US, through impeccable taste in soul and R&B covers, and the development of the Jagger\/Richards songwriting team.\n\nDisc two kicks off with Jumping Jack Flash, the song that signaled to the world that the Stones were back after drug busts and the misguided sidestep into psychedelia. This is the meat of the Stones catalog and it's lean and mean. Then right in the middle of disc drops.....\n\nShe's A Rainbow.\n\nThis is a major faux pas and totally ignorant of the band's history. It's a good song, no doubt, but it belongs on disc one.\n\nDisc three comes out punching with the Stones' second golden age. But here is where some real gems are missing, and the collection begins to feel pinched for space. Respectable didn't even chart in the US, but it's here instead of the more familiar Shattered. She's So Cold and Hang Fire deserve inclusion as well. It's my personal preference that You Got Me Rocking is a much stronger entry than Love Is Strong, although the latter did chart a little higher. I love that the often overlooked Highwire is included, but Don't Stop from the 40 Licks comp doesn't belong.\n\nThe comp ends with two new songs, included to get long-time fans like me who own every other CD by the band to shell out hard-earned cash for songs we already own. (Again, thanks Amazon for the Black Friday deep discount!) While I think Don't Stop and the other new songs on 40 Licks were weak, Doom And Gloom and One More Shot are better, but still suffer from comparison to all the great music you just heard on this set. They do give hope that the Stones still have some fire in the belly and want to make more great music, not just make more piles of money. As I type this, the band is continuing the 50 and Counting Tour, headed to Australia and New Zealand. Let's hope they can still give some great, new music in the future.\n\nFinally, a quick note about the remastered sound. Briefly, it's clear and clean and I have no quibbles with it, but it's not an improvement over the previous remastering.\n\nSo if you're looking for a comprehensive Rolling Stones hits collection that concentrates on the 60s\/early 70s period and cherry picks the rest, the unfortunately titled GRRR! fits the bill.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Bruno Mars first came to my attention when I heard \"The Lazy Song\" performed by a local group called The Blast Addicts. It was around the time of the man's second album that I went back to listen to the first. He has a very soulful sound and is a talented songwriter. There were times where he did seem to concentrate on the novelty aspects of his music. Especially when it came to being eclectic. Recently however,he upped the strong 80's boogie\/electro funk quotient in his music with his Mark Ronson collaboration \"Uptown Funk\". And with a full live band in tow,this sound became the general template for this new third album of his.\n\n\"24k Magic\" starts off the album with a pounding Vocorder\/synthesizer based electro funk jam. \"Chunky\" adds a simple but effective electric bass line with more of a lush jazz\/funk shuffle about it. \"Perm\" gets into a straight up James Brown type groove with really hit horns. \"Versace On The Floor\" and \"Calling All The Lovelies\" are electronically arranged mid tempo slow jams while the slower \"Straight Up & Down\" and the uptempo \"Finese\" have something I never thought would return: a new jack swing rhythm.  The closer \"Too Good To Say Goodbye\" has an electric sitar based Thom Bell Philly ballad flavor while \"That's What I Like\" has a more hip-hop\/trap flavor with a very singable melody.\n\nMusically speaking,this album is possibly the best and most consistent Bruno Mars has made thus far. He's primarily exploring mid 80's electro funk on these songs. Yet he also dabbles in musical innovations from later in the decade too. Even the CD label has a retro 80's flavor. Whether recorded with the band or with one or two people,most of the album has a superb flow. Lyrically,the songs are steeped in the good humored party crew mentality. So there no deep songs here. Though some of the ballads have a strong romantic side to them.. In the end,it points mostly to Bruno Mars's musical strengths than anything else. And provides a solid template for the music he has in store for his in the future.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"This album contains four major country hits but only one of them made it on to the American version of A collection of hits. In Europe, an expanded 13-track collection was released adding the other three but this version is long out of print. So this album, apart from being a high quality original album, also served as hits volume 2 until the more comprehensive Definitive Collection was released.\n\nThe one track that made it onto the American hits collection is Where've you been, which has become Kathy's signature song. However, in this particular song it is the lyrics that people seem to love - they relate to the sentiments expressed. The other hits were all upbeat, catchy songs - Come from the heart, Burning old memories and She came from Fort Worth Texas.\n\nOf the other songs, my favorite is Hills of Alabam. No surprise, really, as this was written and originally recorded by my favorite bluegrass singer, Claire Lynch, who adds backing vocals. Claire's own version can be found on an untitled album by the Front porch string band, of which she was lead singer. The title track is also excellent, as are Here's hoping, True north, Love chooses you and I'll take care of you.\n\nWhile I slightly prefer her two previous albums (Walk the way the wind blows, Untasted honey), there isn't much to choose between the three and those two are better represented on that hits collection. So if you already have that, this should be the next Kathy Mattea album on your shopping list.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"The rating I give is based on how much I like the song.  My opinion\n\nI don't really understand how one can objectively review a song.  It's entirely a matter of opinion, and a review of a song is basically pointless.  I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.\n\nBut youtube exists now.  It's not like you need to base your purchase on what other people think.  You listen to the song, and if you like it enough to want it on your mp3 player (or in better quality than youtube)... (or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.\n\nI guess I'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review... Seriously though, I love the fact that amazon hosts customer reviews, but it's a bit unnecessary for individual songs.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"This review might be a little general. This is not one of Lenny's best but its far from just decent. Lenny continues to give you rock anthems and a couple songs that seem as though written from his personal diary (Papa).I like Lenny b\/c he seems to try to write rock n' roll music and  doesn't leave his comfort zone.  Most of the album is driven by funky guitar rifts and simple (but they are good)lyrics, and actually he plays the guitar more freely on this cd than any of his others.  This cd isn't as personal as Baptized was (which had me thinking Lenny was suicidal;Baptized I think was lyrically his most honest\/personal cd) but it is more of like a solid effort of good fast songs, good funk music, good slow songs.  Lenny is to me a master at making beats. He isn't one of the greatest on the guitar and he really can't sing (although he sounds better with every album)compared to great singers but when it comes to a beat that makes you move your feet and feel like you can't stand still; he is like Pharrell Williams and this cd proves pure rock n' roll; not Heavy Metal; rock n' roll.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Being new to Balligomingo, I was intrigued by the description of the album comparing the music on this album to Delerium and Enigma. Being a big fan of both Delerium and Engima, I simply had to own this album. The lush, ethereal, ambient sounds of Garret Schwarz had me captivated from the second I heard \"Purify\". The song is just one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. \"Escape\" is another song that I completely fell head over heels for. The gorgeous melodies, and heartwrenching vocals took my breath away. The same can be said about \"Falling\" too. Picking a favorite song among this wonder album is too difficult. All the songs are wonderful in their own way. I absolutely loved delicate female vocals used on the album. The women all reminded me of Kristy Thirsk who makes a guest appearance on this album on \"Heat\". I am definitely hooked on what I heard on \"Beneath the Surface\". The etheral vocals and ambient beats makes this album very soothing and relaxing to listen to after a long day at the office. I think if there was a flaw with the album that it was too short but other than that, this album is just perfect. I look forward to hearing more from Balligomingo. \"Beneath the Surface\" definitely is among the top 5 albums of 2002, and an excellent tide me over until Delerium puts out another album.","classification":5,"fold":1}

I remember she sang \"That Old Black Magic\" in a huge medley on television a few years back - it is great to hear her voice re-visit it.  \"These Boots...\", \"I'm Gonna Live...\" and especially \"Mack The Knife\" show a sassy side of Boone that is endearing - listen to the delivery of the line \"did that boy do something rash?\" - she brings her theatre experience to these songs and they all benefit from it.

{"text":"With all the recognition, and awards he has garnered, including a Recording Academy Grammy Scholarship Award, Paul has certainly achieved a remarkable amount for someone barely 30 years old. With that in mind, I was amazed to learn that his latest release, \"Redemption,\" has been 10 years in the making - one third of his life! The first track entitled \"A Lifetime Spent,\" is an introspective solo piano melody draws us in, slowly building in intensity, and becoming quite dramatic. There is a cinematic air to Paul's playing, although certainly not surprising given his background and education in composition and film scoring. An interesting contrast came towards the end when after a dramatic flourish, the piece appears to end, but after a moment of silence, is followed by the most delicate coda, providing a musical yin yang experience. The next song is an emotionally evocative tune called \"To Say Goodbye.\" Unlike the diversity displayed in the previous track, this one stays more on the bittersweet side of the spectrum, and is sure to resonate in the hearts of anyone who has experienced loss and separation in life.\n\nTracks four and five create a two-part story, respectively titled, \" Prelude to a Lullaby,\" and \"Lullaby for the Mending Heart.\" These are the first of the duets heard on the album, and feature the exquisite cello artistry of Tina Guo. Tina is now performing in the Cirque du Soleil show \"Michael Jackson: The Immortal.\" Another beautiful duet is heard on track 8 with a rendition of the classic \"Amazing Grace.\" This song features the superbly talented accompaniment of Christopher Luther on violin. The final duet with cellistTina Guo is on track 10, entitled \"This Is Our Faith.\" Here, as on his work in general, Paul exhibits his mastery of composition as the piece flows through various movements and feelings.\n\n\"Redemption\" by Paul Spaeth is a deeply personal musical experience that draws inspiration from the well of Life. Capable of spanning vast emotional terrain, Paul's music ranges from introspective and impressionistic, to powerful and dramatic expressions of profound feelings that resonate in the innermost being of the listener. Each composition is a perfectly told story that speaks to the experiences we all share. Emotionally evocative and spiritually uplifting, \"Redemption\" is an inspired work of art from the heart of a gifted composer.","classification":5,"fold":1}

It isn't a bad song, but not really anything that really is swooning about. Still Robin is definitely a better singer \/ songwriter than simply all the joke songs that radio has been displaying from artists like Beyonce' and Rihanna.

Anyway, maybe a better title would be I am Stuck in My OLD Empire because although I know Tom is too old to still be singing emo, he has the kind of voice that just isn't suitable for anything BUT that. Remember how on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/blink-s-untitled-album\/dp\/B0000DZDTG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">blink's untitled album<\/a>, Mark was singing lower? Well, Tom's register didn't change at all. There's nothing wrong with that per se, but, well, serious songs and that kind of voice just don't gel like they should. This is especially evidenced when the band shoots for romantic tunes like \"Love Like Rockets\" and \"Breathe\" (\"True Love\" works out pretty well, though).\n\nWhile none of the songs are bad, the songs that stand out the most are the final two tracks: \"Rite of Spring\" and \"Heaven\". The opening track \"Call to Arms\" is pretty good too, as are the instrumentals \"Jumping Rooftops\" and \"Star of Bethlehem\". I-Empire is still satisfying enough for rock fans, but there's really nothing extraordinary here either. B.I.F.\n\nAnthony Rupert","classification":3,"fold":1}

They love and appreciate her because she never tried to be \"Hollywood.\"  She has been that same girl from New York that she was when she made her debut in 1992 and for that, we love her!  She was never surreptitious about her ordeals with drugs, abusive relationships and family drama.  The pain that she has endured is felt all throughout her music, which is something else her supporters appreciate.  She is definitely one of the most sincere and real people in the industry of entertainment; there's no arguing that point.  Her album, \"Growing Pains\" is a great offering.  It doesn't have any songs that are quite as memorable as, say, \"I'm Goin' Down\", \"Sweet Thing\", \"Love No Limit\", \"Be Happy\", or \"Not Gon Cry\" (I could go on for days, she has a slew of sensational songs!!!), but it is a good listen and worth purchasing.\n\n Mary Jane Blige has this unique way of delivering songs; that is, to me, what makes her music so listenable and memorable.  It is not easy to explain, but once you listen to her best songs, you'll understand.  With this album, her delivery is still as it has always been.  \"Talk to Me\" is a prime example of my previous explanation.  She does a nice job executing this track.  She extends her voice quite a bit here, and I enjoyed listening.  Even her faster tracks are heartfelt, for example, \"Just Fine.\"  This song was released to radio, and though it took a few listens to lure me in, I was eventually taken in by this track.  The beat and hook are infectious.  It's one of the best moments on \"Growing Pains.\"  In short, this song is about a woman who is truly confident with being herself and is not about to change because she's \"fine.\" (I suppose that could mean \"fine\" as in mood and\/or physical appearance, take it how you want.)  Someone strongly suggested that I listen to \"Stay Down\" and I am so happy I listened to him!  I listen to that song a lot because, lyrically, it is beautiful.  This song is about staying with your mate through the bad times because good times are sure to come and overpower those harder times.  Those who hear this song are sure to gain something from it.  This album is a bit flawed in a few places.  \"Smoke\" is the weakest moment on the album.  The production is not good, the lyrics are just alright; collectively, it's just not a good track.  Usher shows up for \"Shake Down\" and does a good job, but this track doesn't stand out.  Everything about this track sits on the average mark.\n\n R&B lovers, Mary lovers, and lovers of music, what are you waiting for?  Go get it!  This woman is a true artist and she exhibits that on this album.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"Stay Down\"\n2. \"Just Fine\"\n3. \"Work in Progress (Growing Pains)\"\n4. \"Til the Morning\"\n5. \"Come to Me (Peace)\"","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"This collection of B-Sides is truly necessary to get a completist mindset of the talents and versatility of Amy Winehouse.  Tha album BACK TO BLACK was definitely a concept album about love and relationships and these cuts didn't blend in well or truly fit the concept of what did make the album.  But it in no way means these songs aren't superb and worthy.  Most importantly we have VALERIE which was a huge hit in the UK.  Producer Mark Ronson asked Amy to collaborate with him on it and it appears on his cd but no other Winehouse cd.  A true find.  CUPID is a great soulful version of a classic song.  With MONKEY MAN and HEY LITTLE RICH GIRL Amy has great fun with her band and backup singers to great results.  They are fun, uptempo tracks.  The Cuban styled YOU'RE WONDERING NOW shows yet another side of the versatility Amy possessed.\n\nThe true standouts are the final 2 tracks.  Her rendering of TO KNOW HIM IS TO LOVE HIM will break your heart with its honesty.  And the final demo acoustic version of LOVE IS A LOSING GAME shows Amy's raw and strong talent without the production of a studio.  Instead you get her vocal talent, emotive ability and are left with a strong message of the true talent she possessed.  All these songs are in no way tracks left off for being sub-par but rather songs that just didn't quite fit.  Any Amy Winehouse fan will find them a definite necessity.  Highly recommend.","classification":5,"fold":1}

The tune is rhythm and blues with strong emphasis on the blues side of the fence and carries a fairly up-beat tempo. The lyrics are really good and the vocals are nicely done matching the atmosphere of the songs back drop.\n\nIf your a smokey-room blues fan with the fundamentalist's appreciation for the genre then you will probably enjoy this one a good bit. It isn't straight traditional, but it has many of the hallmarks that traditional blues seems to demand especially in the realm of guitar lead and rhythm.","classification":5,"fold":1}
{"text":"Well, the single track \"F#%@ it\" is almost a parody, but more an alternate explicit version of that song by that chick who sang \"I don't care\/I love it\" with the chorus changed up a bit in the words, and done with a hard rocking backing sound that does sound great. Definitely a 5 star song, a personal favorite for the year, and worthy of being apart of the Buck Cherry greatest hits.\n\nHowever, there is 6 other songs of garbage filler. Calculating that, I come up with a rating of 1.5, so I'll give the LP 2 stars to be generous. But honestly, this is more like a release of a great single with fillers around it, a decent price, one great song, but you might wanna just buy the one song there instead of the LP, unless you're a die hard Buck Cherry fan who must own everything they release.","classification":2,"fold":1}

{"text":"Look, I've been a big fan of Weezer just as much as everyone else has but I'm going to give it to you straight. This album is simply okay. Did Weezer redeem themselves with their last album? Yes, slightly. Does this new album prove that Weezer is back to it's old style? Kinda, not 100% at least.\n\nThere is no doubt that Weezer has most certainly looked back at its older days and decided to take a more rock approach to this record compared to the post-Make Believe albums. Which is great, many of these songs container a more guitar orientated tone that threw me back to the old days and reminded me of the good old classic Weezer that I fell in love with. However, there are still hints of influence from albums like \"Radititude\" on this thing. Every now and again you'll hear a synthesizer like on the background of \"Do You Wanna Get High?\" that flashes me back to Weezer's cringe worthy material and it throws me off completely. Some of the lyrics on here remind me of that too. It's like the band wanted to create an album that really pleases old fans and new and sometimes that's a difficult challenge. Despite all that I would say this album is far from being the worst Weezer album and there is some enjoyment to be had, but if you're going in expecting another blue album, you may find this album passable.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"The Big Schubert Box marks our 15th Big Box.\nThis Schubert collection shows the love of Vienna that runs through the Bach Guild as a label, and as a business.  The Bach Guild made its first recordings in Vienna, where musicians could be had for food (quite literally), and Americans were there with some money to capture a musical scene that was propelled by the access to new scholarship that was limited by world wars.\nThis box actually comes as something of a surprise - the strong amount of Schubert in the Bach Guild catalog snuck up on us. 14 hours of Schubert, and we didn't know we had it. And we've not included works recorded twice (Trout Quintet, Wanderer Fantasy) or short encores.\nYou'll find a tremendous focus on the orchestral works and the solo piano works in this collection. There's just a spare amount of chamber music - perhaps reflecting the marketplace more than the A&R direction of the label.  And just a nice tasty recital of Schubert songs.  Just enough to make us wish for more, but, `tis not to be.\nSo here are the highlights and some additional information that we can provide you:\n1. This collection includes two rarely recorded symphonic works, and they provide debate, as well as offer you some new and hard to find recorded experiences. Symphony No. 7 was essentially completed by Schubert in sketch form, but he only orchestrated a portion of it. Three versions exist of a fully orchestrated version, the version in this box is the Felix Weingartner version.  Our detective work shows there is perhaps only one other recording of this version currently available, and this release marks the first time this recording has been available in fifty years.\n2. The other mysterious Schubert symphony included in this collection is the orchestration of the Grand Duo sonata by Joseph Joachim.  The original release on LP of this performance referred to this work as the \"Gastein\" symphony, but more recent scholarship has shown the ephemeral \"Gastein\" to be simply Schubert's 9th symphony and not some other \"Planet X\" type work floating just out of view. Again - we could only find one other recording of this work, and again, this title has been out of print since the early 1960s.\n3. As for the other goodies that see the light of day after decades of dormancy, we are offering some digital debuts: Bruce Hungerford performing Schubert's Sonata No. 20, and Lili Kraus's performances of the Piano Sonata D.960 and the \"Wanderer\" Fantasy, Sir Charles Mackerras' fine performances of Symphonies No. 5 & 6, the complete incidental music from Rosamunde with Netania Devrath, an hour long live Schubert recital from Elly Ameling and finally, Peter Serkin and Alexander Schneider's complete recordings of the Sonatinas and Rondo Brillante.  None of these recordings has been available for digital download and most of them have been out of print on any format for over a decade.\n4. In the \"not seen in half a century\" category, there are performances of Schubert's Unfinished Symphony with Vienna State Opera Orchestra, as well as a lovely performance of the \"Trout\" Quintet with Denis Matthews and the Vienna Konzerthaus Quartet.\n5. We're also pleased to mention that this box contains absolutely no duplicated material from any other Big Box that we've released - 14 hours of original material.\n6. And a discovery we're sad that we can't release here but we will at some point - in the research for this recording, we discovered 20 minutes of Bruce Hungerford performing light piano works of Schubert, a healthy dose of dances, eccossaises and landler. However, the performer either had a \"gimmick\" where he performed all 12 works without stopping, or someone edited these works so they could make it on the end of some album at some point. We're going to have to break all of these works apart, and that will take time. But we hope to have a Bruce Hungerford set to announce at some point - and now we know it will contain an LP side of Schubert, never before released.\nWe've tried to address the issue some of you have had with tracks being shortened and then appearing in the first two seconds of the following track. We believe we have solved that problem, and the tracks in this collection should be in complete compliance.\nAs always, we appreciate your comments. Look for a new line launch soon - because not everything fits in a Big Box, sometimes you just have to put something in your Pocket...","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"This is where most Nirvana listeners start because it has the most hit singles and is most popular. And yes it is a great album but I don't think its the best one but if you're new to Nirvana then you should probably start here. Rating song by song:\n1. Smells Like Teen Spirit (5\/5)- It's a really good song, one of the best on here, very overplayed on t he radio but still one of the best\n2. In Bloom (5\/5)- Its extremely catchy and also has the tendency to wear out if you play it too much but its a good song\n3. Come As You Are (5\/5)- It has kind of a dark feeling to it, not as loud as Smells like teen Spirit but very catchy.\n4. Breed 5\/5- Now this song is very energetic and will punch you in the face with its fuzzed out guitar yet still manages to stick in your head\n5. Lithium (5\/5)- This song is very unique because its a very simple song yet it is very catchy and effective with relatively hard guitar under it.\n6. Polly (5\/5)- This is the simplest song on the album, just one acoustic guitar and a cymbal crash, and it is still very moving.\n7. Territorial Pissings (5\/5)- Now this song isn't for everyone but its fuzzed out punk rock at its finest but still manages to be somewhat catchy\n8. Drain You (5\/5)- a very poppy rock song with an odd breakdown in the middle that kind of keeps you in suspense.\n9. Lounge Act (5\/5)- Not a stand out track on the album but a really good one nonetheless (i did put 5 out of 5). It's catchy and becomes very raw and emotional at the end. Its amazing how the bass intro is so effective.\n10. Stay Away (5\/5)- This is also not a \"standout\" but a great song; alot of change-ups in the duration of the song and intense drumming.\n11. On a Plain (5\/5)- This one tends to be overlooked but is really good but its very catchy and kind of cheery haha. The harmonizing is VERY good, if you don't like it at first itll grow on you\n12. Something In the Way 5\/5- When I first heard this I got easily bored of it fast; but now i feel the intensity of it, even if the verses are sung repeatedly. The cellos in the background give it this haunting atmosphere. This will also grow on you\n\nThis album is catchy pop rock meets fuzzed out hard rock. Simple as that.\nIts a great combination and I don't understand the term grunge because how I put it is what it really is. Buy this album.","classification":5,"fold":1}

A sound that was new for them, but then Major\/minor comes out and It could easily have been mistaken as beggars. The sound was so similar and this is what plagues the new album.\n\nThe band has gotten into this \"just ok\" phase. The early albums had a punch you in the face intensity and the albums to follow matured into a deep and passionate approach. Now a days, its just like whatever. I find the new album very underwhelming.\n\nIf you are a thrice fan and already have all the other albums, sure pick this one up I guess.

{"text":"Just like an orchestra conductor standing on a podium, one New Age artist first held his raised baton in hand, and began to cue the first downbeat gesture for his debut album.  What emerged after the final cutoff gesture was made, led to an upbeat direction for his first album's achievements, and proclaimed admiration for this relatively new artist.\n\nDavid Wahler is the musician orchestrating Antiquus in a like manner, where his time signature expertly directed a unique phrasing in tempo, dynamics, and articulation, leading to welcoming salutations of praise during the final reception at the end of his first orchestration.\n\nDavid Wahler has stepped onto the conductor's podium for a second time.  With all eyes watching, and with several decisive taps of the hand baton, he confidently cues in his current 2010 release A Star Danced, in an encore performance notably holding great expectations.  Composed, performed, and arranged solely by David Wahler, this album represents a heartfelt narration surrounding his family circle past and present, where resolution of personal life challenges are reflected as a unique source of inspiration for his music's identity, lovingly embraced by his close family heritage.\n\nAntiquus is his greatly applauded 2009 album surprising many by the paramount success granted to such a relative newcomer in the New Age music industry.  The consistent airplay and high ranking in Zone Music Reporters charts is widely recognized, along with pending nominations for 2009 in 4 categories, yet to be decided.  Likewise you will find Antiquus is held in high regard with our own NewAgeMusic.nu Best Albums of 2009 Awards, so these merits do speak quite clearly.  Music itself is not new to David since he began playing piano by ear at age 7, then formal music studies in college academics before directing several theater directing productions, performing with the Rockford Symphony Orchestra & New American Theatre, while also teaching music appreciation to disadvantaged and handicapped children.\n\nA Star Danced is New Age, Contemporary, Electronic, Ambient, Neo Classical, and Orchestration, nicely displayed by his directing hands, where it becomes apparent this second release sharply manifests a sweeping one and two and timing, in relation to the precision delivery of his already admired discography.\n\nThe song Quest is the Epic alpha and omega heralding in 14 classics of A Star Danced, and perhaps a fine talking point of those like myself giving their own conclusions about his second release.  To me, this sensational wonder is a revelation to behold, given the heavenly virtuoso trumpet intonation with pronounced percussion taps unveiling moderate rhythms while keyboard and tenor vocals gently mesmerize.  Having these bold dynamics and a contrasting sheer ambience of lightly drawn out vibrato notes, it could be telling of a more calming and peaceful resolution made during some of our most challenging moments.\n\nThe atmosphere in the Title Song by soft soprano and tenor vocals echo nicely behind droplet-like keystrokes and percussion rhythms blending into one relaxing starlit entity.  The Seeds of Time are generously sown by guitar soloist Brent Gunter, where his evolving impressions are backed by moderate keyboards and celestial choir.  Come Gentle Night has a light sway led by beautiful keyboard bell tones similar to Peaseblossom & Reverie.  Sigh Away Sunday & Vespera are new images holding a conforming poise from the well conducted Antiquus album, giving fresh ambient patterns to the ensemble of songs.\n\nYvonne is a heartfelt rendition where harp and piano melody embrace to portray a most positive affirmation, and where keys changes bravely touch on an optimistic melodic tone.  It is in this song where piano, strings, and harp join in a tribute to a special person, and where the significance of someone very dear to David is personified.  Missing You is first composed in singular piano notes where a solemn melody gives a peaceful and serene placement of solitude in the earliest moments while nicely responding with a graceful tribute.  Piano notes resolve in a most dignified phasing, giving rise by a reverent conclusion, where ordained notes of respect and solidarity become intertwined in the loving arms of melancholy.\n\nQuest ( Reprise ) makes a return odyssey to the dynamic opening impressions, becoming the concluding exodus to again reveal the bold aesthetic testimonial of David's second album.  Devoted to his unique signature which retains your interest and imagination from the first cue to the final cutoff note, I do expect honorable recognition will be given to David Wahler & A Star Danced, pending this album's overall final reception","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"What else can be said about the man's career that hasn't already?  But I'll give it a shot.\n\nIn this modern era of music where releasing compilations has practically become its own genre Nothing Has Changed is a hallmark.  This really can be called a definitive Bowie collection; instead of simply repackaging and rearranging the order the tracks appear only to then leave some out- yeah, I'm looking at you Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin- this one encompasses a full fifty years (FIFTY!) of great music, trend setting originality and pop art.\n\nThis 3 CD masterpiece is presented in reverse chronological order, so the first track is the new one, \"Sue (or In A Season of Crime)\"- an avant garde jazz piece that reminds you of sixties era Frank Sinatra, Miles Davis, Dave Grusin, etc.  Felt to me like it was an acknowlegement of his roots, the beatnik cool from back when he started out.  And it's fantastic.\n\nYou also get other gems like \"Let Me Sleep Beside You\" and \"Your Turn to Drive\", both off of his unreleased \"Toys\" cd, and a re-recording of \"Shadow Man\".  The only thing missing from this is the B-side from the new single. \"Tis a Pity She's a Whore\".\n\nThe sound quality is superb; my only complaint here is that most songs appear as their single edit versions instead of as full album cuts.  This is a trip down memory lane that's more than worth the ticket.  Enjoy.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"After a few albums of searching for a sound, Newman experimented and finally found his sound on \"Sail Away\". He experimented so much, in fact, that \"Randy Newman Live\" was released as a stopgap in 1971;it also previewed 2 songs from this album in stripped-down piano-only versions. The \"alternate\" take of the title track on this reissue shows just how much Newman experimented. Pounding anthemic rhythyms gave way to more lush but not overstated arrangements. The final release was very much worth the wait. Newman brings orchestra back into the fray after completely abandoning it on \"12 Songs\" (most likely the abandonment came as a result of the use - and sometimes abuse - of orchestra on his debut album). Newman's piano and the orchestra meld wonderfully in the mix. Some of the arrangements are downright amazing (especially on the title track and \"He Gives Us All His Love\"). Thematically the album could not be more diverse: God, death, politics, satire at a Swiftian level, sex, and success. Newman's ability to communicate cynical satire in a way that takes itself seriously without seeming self-righteous is displayed all over this album. When he's funny he's also profound. \"God's Song\" is hilarious while at the same time chilling. The same could be said for the sadly still all too relevant \"Political Science\". In the midst of these songs, the serious numbers are almost shocking. There probably hasn't been a more candid song about death and belief than \"Old Man\". Newman claims that audiences have walked out on this one, so he's stopped playing it. It's a great song, but yes, an absolute downer. \"Dayton, Ohio - 1903\" evokes the era the song is set in complete with breeze and front porch swing. \"Memo to My Son\" is an absolutely hilarious song about parenting; the character in the song promises to show his son how smart he is, and then rattles off clich after clich. \"You Can Leave Your Hat On\" has become a very recognizable song, maybe one of Newman's best known songs (even for people who have no idea who Randy Newman is).\nThe bonus tracks on the reissue are interesting: \"Let It Shine\" is an upbeat and happy song more akin to Newman's movie soundtracks of late. It was written for a sitcom that apparently never aired, which explains the mood. \"Maybe I'm Doing it Wrong\" was included on \"Randy Newman Live\"; this is the studio version complete with orchestration. The rest are demos of songs on \"Sail Away\". All are good tracks that complement the album well.\nIt's no surprise that this album is considered a classic by many critics. It's one of Newman's best, and one of his best-sellers. A good album to introduce someone to Newman's music. It was the first Newman album I heard, and I've been a voracious fan ever since.","classification":5,"fold":1}

We need to stop writing songs about the problems, and actually step up and FIX them.\n\nHowever.\n\nThe lyrics just feel hollow, as for the meaning of the song, when the corporations and governments of this world are more toxic than ever. The Beatles nailed it over half a century ago... \"You say you want a revolution...\" But no one's got the stones to make it happen ever again.\n\nInstead, we'll bury our heads in the sand and let the right and left and the megacorporations and religions a, b, and c, control our world while we slave away to prop them up further above us every day. Good luck out there.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"When 50 First came on the scene, I was a little skeptic of what he was all about. I thought since he was working with Dr. Dre that maybe Dre had picked up on someone that had some talent and could give us a solid hip-hop artist. I was dead wrong. WHen this CD was first released, I didn't think it was terrible, but the more it got overplayed, and the more nosense I heard about 50, the less appealing the CD became to me. It is apparent that 50 was a creation of some money hungry record label that probely got ahold of Dre (thank Interscope Records) and asked him if he could sign on with him and be part of his Aftermath label. What a joke, not only is 50 probely the least think from a ganster, he is a total sell out. I love how he hangs in Beverly Hills Spa's and Star Magazine parties. Sure he is a ganasta alright. Does anyone really believe that this guy was shot 9 times. I bet you his real name is Erkel and he proebely grew up some posh suburban community and got stuffed into lockers in high-school. Shame on you Dre for putting this dope on your record label, and shame on Interscope for pressuring you into signing him. DO I have proof that this happened? NO, but I am more then 99.9% sure that this is how it went down. Everyone do 50 and favor and boycott his next CD, then maybe his can Get Poor and Die Penniless.","classification":1,"fold":1}

{"text":"It's amazing what a few Grammy nominations can do.  India. Arie's debut album of folk-laced soul didn't break any new ground, but it was an overall appealing mix of catchy tunes and positive messages that were a welcome alternative to the talk-show\/men-bashing lyrics of her ghettoized peers.  And even though she walked home empty-handed on Grammy night, her debut album, \"Acoustic Soul,\" enjoyed robust multiplatinum sales.  Expectations are naturally high, and I hoped that her followup \"Voyage to India,\" would be a musical and lyrical step forward from her debut.  While the album is thoroughly listenable from start to finish, \"Voyage to India\" just doesn't serve a platter filling enough to stick to your ribs.  Arie has her heart in the right place, and her intentions are noble, but the truth remains that she's a passable lyricist, often resorting to \"love yourself\" cliches that become one-dimensional.  And while the music is pleasing, the folkish, acoustic-based melodies and choruses seem a bit predictable.  However, I really dug \"Little Things,\" the sincerity of the love song \"Beautiful Surprise,\" and \"Get it Together.\"  While \"Voyage to India\" is an okay album, it pales in comparison to better, superior albums we've heard in the last year from \"Cookie\" by MeShell Ndegeocello, the flawed yet fascinating \"Unplugged\" set from Lauryn Hill, and \"How Do I\" from Res.  Ultimately, it's a \"Voyage\" that takes off promisingly without ever reaching its final destination.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Katy Perry's second single 'Teenage Dream' is a blast. The lyrics paint a picture of someone who is slightly guarded until they meet someone that makes them feel comfortable enough to let go and be themselves. Then they have fun together. I haven't actually heard it on the radio in the car yet, but I can picture it being a great song to blast on the radio with the windows down.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I HAVE heard it on the radio just not in the car. But anyway, this song is one of the few songs on the album with a pop-rock appeal ('Hummingbird Heartbeat' being the other).\n\nThe video showcases a bunch of young adults having fun on the beach and in the water, dancing and just doing things that young people enjoy! It is slightly racy but nothing we haven't seen before.\n\n'Teenage Dream' gets two thumbs way up. Best song on the album!\n\nBuyers beware: This album isn't like her first for the most part.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/One-of-the-Boys\/dp\/B0017ZB8M6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">One of the Boys<\/a>&nbsp;had pretty much only a pop-rock flair with some dance tunes, but this one switches things with a dance-pop appeal with some pop-rock tunes.\n\nJust wanted to give you the heads up!\n\n4.25 stars or an 8.5\/10.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"In all heir pompous glory, Muse are old fashioned prog-rock band, with the fat trimmed off and aspirations toward the big statement. With \"Drones,\" that landed a live one. \"Drones\" is allegedly about the dehumanizing of men and the militarization of the world. Y'know, you're a drones, we fight with drones and don't you make me one. Packed with big guitars, flourishing keyboards and Queenly harmonies, it's just what a Muse fan would be looking for, The concept gets a little wavy at times, but it's all good music.\n\nThe best songs are where the band stretches out, like \"Pyscho\" or the sprawling \"Aftermath,\" a 10-minute epic that starts with an Ennio Morricone whistle, plays into a Pink Floyd vibe before finally tearing into some muscular metal. And that's before Matt Bellamy even sings a note, which he does over another flourish of piano. It's not like Muse has not tread this turf before, there was the two-pronged title track to \"The Second Law\" and the three part \"Exogenesis\" off \"The Resistance.\" Just this time, they crammed it all into one song and rock it into submission. Same for the album opener, \"Dead Inside,\" which throbs like Queen's \"We Will Rock You.\"\n\nI'm all for bands making sloppy concept albums. Done well, the concept often takes a back seat to the songs (like \"Drones\") or overwhelms and makes the album fly along one big trajectory (think of the classic Jethro Tull album, \"Thick as a Brick\"). Either way, you'll get more bang for your buck, and Muse are such a great band that \"Drones\" is a big deal of fun, without the overwhelm. It's as much a concept album as a return to form. Top notch stuff.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"It turns out the old saying is true: The family that plays together, stays together. Four siblings and their best pal make up indiepop group Eisley, whose debut EPs hinted at what they could do. And \"Room Noises\" certainly proves that their airy, whimsical pop was worth the long wait for.\n\nSome of the songs are from those EPs, although they sound a bit tighter and smoother. For example, the heartbreaking ode to the bullied, \"Telescope Eyes,\" or the prettily whimsical \"Marvelous Things.\" Despite the airy poesy of the songs, there's a distinctly melancholy streak through the album, which peaks at the very beginning: \"Memories,\" a haunting song about a woman mourning her husband's suicide.\n\nDespite a few EP songs, they also have quite a few new songs, like the enchantingly sunny \"Golly Sandra,\" which has echoes of the Beach Boys. But the sparkling pop vibe continues in other songs, carried over in piano melodies and smooth guitar riffs. \"Still floating soft\/I am dreaming and I'm glad I lost\/And still with my fingers\/I'm drawing circles in the water,\" the song goes, as fluid as the water it talks about.\n\nThat mixture of bittersweetness and innocent optimism is what makes Eisley so darn appealing. Nowhere are the stereotypical I-just-wanna-have-fun or my-boy\/girlfriend-dumped-me-and-now-I-wanna-swim-with-the-toaster music for THIS pop band. While they have some love songs, the emphasis is on their enchanting kind of whimsy.\n\nThat whimsy carries over into just about whatever they sing about, whether it's Sherri and Staci singing about dragons in the woods, sunlight and butterflies, or metal teeth and \"telescope eyes.\" Some of the lyrics seem to stray into Flaming Lips-type surrealism, but are also grounded by simple sentiments like, \"You have shining eyes, yes like those forest lights, and it makes me want to cry.\"\n\nAfter the past few years, with the group rapidly moving out of the teen bracket, one would wonder if Stacy and Sherri Dupree's angelic vocals would have gotten... well, not so pretty. No problem with that -- they sound a bit like younger versions of Beth Gibbons or perhaps Hope Sandoval. The two girls even interplay their vocals in on song, with remarkable skill and spine-tingling results.\n\nAt the start of one song, the line \"Congratulations, we've finally made it\" is sung. And so Eisley has -- and this promising band only shows signs of getting even better in albums to come.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Yes, this has already been covered by numerous other reviewers here, but I truly believe 'Confident' is Demi Lovato's best work to date!\n\nOn her 5th album, Lovato reveals a sexy side unheard of\/unseen on her previous records.  On 'Confident', Demi struts her stuff in these playful, care-free (yet more mature) tracks.  Needless to say, she doesn't give a rat's a-- what people think of her.\n\nReviewer Justin Alvis wrote: \"I'm glad she finally made an explicit album too (it was about time haha)\" [original review posted October 19, 2015] ...Yes, an explicit album from Lovato has been long overdue(: So glad to see she's finally broken away from the Disney mold for good!\n\nTracklist\/notable things:\n\n1. Confident - Great album opener! The use of horns give the song a nice touch.  Reminds me of \"The Wolf\" by Heart (if it was in a different key) ...? ok, don't ask(:  Lovato taunts the double entendre: \"It's time to get the chains out \/ Is your tongue tied up?\"\n\n2. Cool For The Summer - critics have compared this song to Katy Perry's \"I Kissed A Girl\" (not just in theme, but song structure as well). True, while \"CFTS\" is basically Katy's song in a different key, that doesn't make \"Summer\" bad...nice to see Lovato returning to her pop-rock roots w\/ this one.\n\n3. Old Ways - interesting beats [between verses] in this track\n\n4. For You - sounds like an update of Miley Cyrus' \"Wreckingball\"\n\n5. Stone Cold - shows off Lovato's arresting vocals...good Lord, the girl has some serious pipes!\n\n6. Kingdom Come (feat. Iggy Azalea) - some stated this as the album's worst track...but it's my favorite!  Perhaps Iggy's presence caused dislike?  This Lovato\/Azalea collaboration turned out very...interesting.  I like it!  Hope it's a single!\n\n7. Waitin For You (feat. Sirah) - a supposed-Miley Cyrus diss track.  Loving the chorus!\n\n8. Wildfire - beautiful song!\n\n9. Lionheart - based on the album's linear notes, it's an ode to child (whom I assume Lovato shared a close bond with) who passed away.\n\nUnfortunately, it's the album's weakest track.  Demi's vocals sound strained here; pushing her voice too hard\/over singing.  This song could've been so much more...unfortunately, Lovato's boisterous vocal delivery falls flat.\n\n10. Yes - gorgeous mid-tempo gospel-tinged tune\n\n11. Father - An emotional song that finds Lovato reflecting on her rocky relationship with her estranged [now late] biological father.  Again, gospel influences can be heard.  A beautiful album closer.\n\nDeluxe Edition tracks:\n\n12. Stars - reminds me of Nicki Minaj's \"Starships\".  It's ok.  Nothing special though\n\n13. Mr. Hughes - a jazzy track that recalls Lovato's own \"Behind Enemy Lines\" (bonus track off her debut).  I also hear a tinge of (dare I say?) Amy Winehouse in Lovato's voice on this.  Lovato should really consider recording an entire jazz &\/or gospel-influenced album.\n\n14. Cool For The Summer (Jump Smokers Remix)\n15.

It's great, but not this. The video version is much livelier.\n\nThe song itself is pretty impressive though; it lets us know who Sara actually is; what she wants; needs and most importantly, how she thinks! Lyrics are subtly interesting and the piano work is somewhat infectious, albeit simple.\n\nI've heard the samples here, and although they weren't enough to make me want to purchase the album, it doesn't take away from this awesome single and I will still give them another go someday!\n\n5 stars.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"This is a wonderful song about how someone can become addictive to you in a passionate and fun type of way. He sings how his desire is the \"perfect drug\" for him, and how it benefits him in various ways.  The music to this song is very unique in that it is a beautiful and creative musical fusion of dancey,techno, and rock sounds. I also love the music video to this song. He has a very gothic look in the video, and he pulls it off very well. Listening to this song can remind you of someone that is addicting to you in a sensual kind of way, and vice versa (you being addictive to them). In my humble opinion, I only wish that this song got more attention and fame when it came out because it compares to the \"Closer\" song in a very good way.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"In 2013, British proto prog legends Deep Purple returned with a new album that also meant to be a return to their 1970`s sound. Now What? Is far from that, but still has some 1970`s flavor that makes this album a listening delight. The best part of this album is the excellent guitar solos by Steve Morse and the outstanding keyboard hooks by Dan Airey that almost equal the ones done by the deceased and long-time keyboardist Jon Lord. However, Ian Paice, Roger Glover and Ian Gillian shine on this album on drums, bass guitar and vocals. The opener A Simple Song has an incredible intro with Roger Glover on bass guitar, Ian Gillian on vocals and Steve Morse on guitar. Then, the song turns upbeat after the the intro, which is almost shocking. Weirdistan is a great follow-up to A Simple Song; Out of Hand has a Kashmir-like intro and melodies; Hell for Pay has a good uptempo vibe, as well as Bodyline, which sounds pretty similar to Def Leppard. Above and Beyond is, in my humble opinion, the jewel of the crown on this album. It is much softer and melodic than the previous two tracks; what makes this song even better is the Ian Gillian`s vocals with the excellent guitar work by Steve Morse and the keyboard work by Dan Airey that makes this song a remembrance of the late 1960`s-1970`s sound. Blood from A Stone follows up with a melodic sound. Again, Dan Airey excels in his keyboard work, particularly in the use of the Hammond Organ, which was heavily used by Jon Lord for decades, especially in the 1970`s. Uncommon Man has a wonderful keyboard progression at the very beginning; another track that has not to be missed out is Aprs Vous, which is quite similar in vibe to that of Hell For Pay. All The Time In The World can easily be the album`s 2nd best track and there is one good reason for this statement: the song`s middle section is as evocative as in Above and Beyond. Vincent Price and It`ll be Mine close this incredible album in great form. Overall, Now What? finds Deep Purple in a great shape, musically, lyrically and vocally speaking. It is a great way to pay a well deserved tribute to Jon Lord,  dead in July 2012, who was the band`s heart and soul, along with his former mate Ritchie Blackmore. Grab this one, if you are long time fan of the Purples.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Here we present the runner-up in our Facebook vote for the Big Box our followers would like to see  and its turned into quite an odyssey. When we put these boxes together, we like to create the box using the following recipe: take some historic performances, add in some long-lost recordings and try to add something special. Sometimes we can achieve passing marks in all three categories, sometimes we get some from one and not much in another. But The Big Schumann Box represents a very strong grade (we think), and were even able to add some star power to this set. If you are a fan of Schumann, were very proud to present this new box. And if you're looking for an introduction to Schumann, between these performances and our every-day low price of .99, you cant miss.\n\nFirst a word  The Bach Guilds digital destiny has been driven by enthusiastic response from music lovers, and it has propelled The Bach Guild far past where we thought we would be. The Big Schumann Box represents our 50th release  which is probably about 40 more releases than we ever thought wed issue. As The Bach Guilds success has continued, we have broadened our sources of repertoire. The Big Schumann Box includes repertoire far afield of the Bach Guild\/Vanguard catalog, although we always include recordings from the Vanguard\/Bach Guild catalog in each release. For this release, were happy to include never-before released recordings from the Pro Arte and eOne Classics catalog, our sisters (all these catalogs are now owned by one company).\n\nIts always a side benefit of creating these boxes for The Bach Guild to present music that has not been widely available (part of the recipe), and this box is full of neglected recordings that are seeing the first light of digital exposure. And this box has a startling number of digital debuts from some of the finest recording artists of the past 50 years: Arleen Auger singing a short recital; Lorraine Hunt (pre-Lieberson) performing songs from a long out of print recording, Rosina Llevinne performing a rarely heard Schumann work for piano and orchestra, and Russell Sherman performing Schumanns piano concerto with the Utah Symphony Orchestra.\n\nAlfred Brendels Vanguard Schumann recordings are featured here, as are the recordings of Swiss pianist Jacqueline Blanchard. From the Vanguard\/Bach Guild vaults comes a Schumann Liederkreis recital, featuring mezzo-soprano Lorna Sydney, a long time participant in Vanguard\/Bach Guilds European recordings of Mahler and Bachs cantatas (for those that look these things up, the original LP release was VRS 411 and includes a recording of Brahmss Songs for Alto, Viola and Piano, Op. 91 which we somehow overlooked for our Big Brahms Box).\n\nSince Schumanns music AND his life were influential, we made the decision to add a few works that push the boundaries for inclusion in a Big Schumann Box. Please note  we call this the Big Schumann Box and not just the Big Robert Schumann Box, as weve included several works for piano by Clara Schumann. Her Piano Concerto, Op. 7 and Piano Sonata in G minor are here, MORE digital debuts on this Big Schumann Box.  Available are Paganinis 24 Caprices, set to Schumanns piano accompaniment (another long-out-of-print recording). And to finish  it wouldnt be right to not include Schumanns most famous discovery, Johannes Brahms. Brahms is represented here by pianist Jacqueline Blancard, performing Variations on a Theme by Schumann.\n\nSo this really is a BIG Schumann Box and one of the most ambitious and interesting that weve presented. We hope you agree that weve tried to follow our recipe and we certainly appreciate your continued support of The Bach Guilds Big Boxes.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"This album is the next generation piece to the original 1973 release. More people, a less-minimalist sound, later vintage material. That earlier release was the first John Fogerty solo album for followers of Creedence, and it came at a time when country was identified with the generation that said that you grow up, you go into the Army and get your butt shot at, because if you dodge the draft and go to college, attending classes taught by commie profs, you become a commie too. At the same time, prominent preachers said that rock was the \"devil's heartbeat\". So country became synonymous with uncool and you mocked it by howling like a hound dog. Fogerty took country, added blues the same way the 'Fifties rockabillies had done years before, and called it \"Creedence\". This album is the second disc of what might have been a double album that was finished 36 years later. Fogerty, being the mature artist he is, avoids coming up with totally new versions of the covers that are here, avoids the ego trip of \"making the songs his own\". Look, the man is around 60, so he's going to think like a grown-up. Even down to giving lead phrases in some songs to guest vocalists. He plays Rick Nelson's \"Garden Party\" straight ahead (matching the backup vocals and lead guitar hooks from the original), same as with John Denver's \"Back Home Again\". His own 1986 song \"Change In the Weather\" gets a countryish remake here. And remember the line in the Creedence classic \"Lookin' Out My Back Door\" that goes \"...listenin' to Buck Owens...\"? Fogerty gives tribute to the memory of his fellow Californian by including \"I Don't Care (Just As Long As You Love Me)\" here. Anybody who thinks solo Fogerty begins and ends with \"Centerfield\" (as well as thinking modern country began with Randy Travis and Garth Brooks) should grab this one, along with the 1973 Rangers release as a prologue.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I mentioned in my Ludacris review that I was wondering where 8Ball and MJG have been lately. Well, my question was answered after hearing their Bad Boy debut, Living Legends. I just finished listening to the album, and it's like this: if you're a hardcore fan of Ball and G, then you won't hesitate to pick this up. As for the rest of us...\n\nLyrically, Ball and G are still impressive for the most part. But since this a Bad Boy record, you can't really expect this to be like their other albums. You have to be ready for one or two radio-friendly joints. But sometimes songs like that are just blatant. This is especially evidenced by the song featuring Bun-B, which rides an obvious made-for-radio beat, yet is called \"The Streets\". And then there are some questionable songs for the ladies, \"Forever\" featuring Lloyd (note to those that still don't know: Lloyd and Lloyd Banks are NOT the same person) and \"Trying to Get At You\" featuring 112. Love-oriented rap songs featuring 112 usually aren't more than filler; ask Mobb Deep.\n\nAnother filler track is the obligatory song about cars, \"Look At the Grillz\" (featuring T.I. and Twista). It's hard to enjoy the first verse especially, because whoever is rapping (T.I. or MJG) is doing it so low that I can barely hear him. And as far the interludes go, note to Diddy: \"Mad Rapper\" still isn't funny. And does anyone have any idea what the guy in \"Get a Kit\" is talking about?\n\nLike I said before, 8Ball and MJG still have it lyrically, except for maybe some of the choruses (\"Don't Make\", anyone?). But questionable production, dry subject matter, and lame guest stars damper the party. Other reviewers see it debatable as to whether they should be calling themselves living legends (but I don't agree with the person that said Onyx is a living legend), but as far as I'M concerned, it's like this: judging from this album, if one person says to another person, \"Man, 8Ball and MJG are living legends!\" the response wouldn't be, \"And they're still making great music!\" It would be more like, \"O...K...Nice to know it.\"\n\nAnthony Rupert","classification":3,"fold":1}

Feelings run deep when you get inside a song, like this one. You become like Icarus flying with waxen wings toward the hot sun onto his own destruction - set on fire but unwilling to let go of the heat - for in so doing - you release from your grip a smooth-as-silk musical experience.

{"text":"The Crystals were Phil Spector's most successful girl group and the mainstay of the Philles label through the early sixties. Like most of the girl groups before Motown, they were from New York and were one of the groups that defined the New York Sound. I remember being really surprised when i learned that Phil Spector lived and recorded in L.A.' But it's such a New York sound', I thought. The Crystals and Ronettes were from New York, and even more than that, the songs were composed by the great Brill Building composers like Goffin & King, Weil & Mann and Barry & Greenwich, and the Brill Building was just north of Times Square. Spector himself learned production not only from Stan Ross at L.A.'s Gold Star (where he would record most of his songs) but also went to apprentice with Lieber & Stoller in the Brill Building. This is why an early hit like Uptown has a sound similar to The Drifters.\n\nThe group formed in 1961 with the help of their uncle, Benny Wells, who had played in big bands; they were named for his daughter, Crystal. Phil Spector and Lester Sill had just formed Philles Records (Phil & Les) and, looking for talent, signed The Crystals right away. In early '62 There's No Other Like My Baby became the label's first Top 20 hit and already showed the amplification of the girls' voices with echo and reverb. Such sudden success meant television appearances and tours in Cavalcade of Stars type formats with lots of groups and performers from all Top 40 styles.\n\nThe big hit came in the Fall of '62 with He's a Rebel, and it's such a strange story I just have to tell it, though I'll try to keep it short. The song was written by singer Gene Pitney, who was also breaking out with hits like Town Without Pity and (The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valence. It was first offered to The Shirelles, but they turned it down because they didn't like the idea of the boy being bad. Spector meanwhile had recently taken the job of head of A&R at the Liberty label, a major independent. They had it slated to be Vikki Carr's next single, but when Spector heard it he knew it had hit potential and decided to beat Liberty and record it himself. Now Phil Spector may have been a brilliant producer who supervised every aspect of his operation, but he wasn't a particularly nice person. Like Alfred Hitchcock who famously called his actors \"cattle\", I believe Spector thought the songs were all about him, and the singers were really just another element in the mix. And with a full Phil Spector production with its many backup vocalists, band members and engineering tricks, in a sense he was right. The Crystals were on tour and couldn't get to L.A. as fast as Spector needed to beat Liberty to the punch. So he had Darlene Love & the Blossoms record it but then put it out as The Crystals, probably because they were his big hit group and that would guarantee airplay. The actual Crystals had to promote it as their own and Darlene Love couldn't say anything. He's a Rebel hit #1 in the country on November 3, 1962 keeping Gene Pitney's Only Love Can Break a Heart from the #1 position.\n\nThat was not a one time thing for Spector. He used Darlene Love & the Blossoms on several other crystals releases, sometimes with Crystals' lead Dolores\" La La\" Brooks. four early Darlene Love & the Blossoms songs were put on The Crystals' Greatest Hits album. The Crystals weren't done with hits yet. They continued their streak with the upbeat He's Sure the Boy I Love in late '62  and in '63, the big year of the Girl Groups they had two classics, Da Doo Ron Ron and Then He Kissed Me. These were full, all-out Spector Wall-of-Sound productions that seem to have been recorded in the Bayreuth Festival Hall with a cast of hundreds. They sounded great, delivering a feeling of excitement unheard of on a 45RPM record. Spector may have been inconsiderate of his performers but he gave his all to the recordings.\n\nThen He Kissed Me was the last hit for The Crystals. They later claimed that once he signed Ronnie & the Ronettes, he neglected them. That very well could be true, but their two low-charting 1964 songs, Little Boy and All Grown Up are on this collection and they are good songs given the full production. 1964 was the year of The British Invasion,and that was what was probably having the biggest effect on The Crystals' career.\n\nThis is an excellent retrospective and I can't imagine a better one coming out in the near future. It is from EMI, now part of Universal, and has been beautifully remastered and is better than the 1992 ABKCO disc with the pink cover.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"It has never been easy to peg Joss Stone to a particular genre. She seems to wander around R & B, Soul, Pop and Jazz most of the time, but she has her own voice and rhythm. She also has an inherent sense of whimsy that is sometimes reflected in her playfulness with handling a song, whether it manifests itself in lyrics or an adopted accent. I think thats why so many of us love her singing; despite having a unique sound, she plays around with what shes doing so that she brings something new to every project and every song. She definitely brought a new, but recognizable sound to Water for Your Soul. World Music is probably the best moniker for the type of music it represents with sounds reminiscent of AfroPop, Caribbean, Reggae, Spanish guitar and maybe a bit of Celtic. I think this quote from a Los Angeles Times interview nicely summarizes her attitude toward genres: My mum said the album is in the world music section on Amazon. Im chuffed, because what do I know? Im just making music, and Im enjoying the sounds I get to hear from all the travel. None of her whimsical nature or a view that genres aren't important is indicative of how seriously she takes her music; she is all about music making.\n\nHer mix of layered sounds, rhythms paced to meaning and that great soulful voice of Ms. Stones are the essence of the magic of this album. While I typically immerse myself in any album I review, Ive probably listened to this one at least couple dozen times. Each stanza, every turn of phrase and lilt of guitar or punch of drum come together to give a complexity and nuance to the music that allows us to continually uncover more to the music.\n\nFor full review: http:\/\/ppcorn.com\/us\/joss-stone-water-soul-album-review\/","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"In late 2003, the pop rockers Lifehouse, returned to the music scene with their second album STANLEY CLIMBFALL. Their new product was by far some of the rock band's best work. Vocals were incredibly melodic, the rhythm section wasn't over powering, and the entire album just had amazing musical traits. STANLEY CLIMBFALL opens with a good rock dance tune, and soon becomes a collection of powerful rock ballads. The progressions to the songs are not much more than the standard I-IV-V, but there is a reason why that progression is so popular and it works perfectly with the pieces of this album. The band is built from the drums keeping perfect time and the bass as the melodic foundation so the guitars and vocalist can lay out their amazing performance. Everything played by these instruments are so independent from each other but the counterpoint is crafted so well, that the pieces are just outstanding. Dynmaics are a major key to these songs as they should be for any piece, but Lifehouse performs this musical aspect perfectly. STANLEY CLIMBFALL is a great piece of work and one to add to any music collection.\n\nStand out tracks include:\n\n\"Spin\"\n\n\"Wash\"\n\n\"Sky Is Falling\"\n\n\"Stanley Climbfall\"\n\n\"Take Me Away\"","classification":4,"fold":1}
{"text":"One message in this song (shown clearly in the music video) is how judgmental, haughty and insensitive some Christians can be. Instead of being Christlike, some stay in their little cliques, paying no attention to those who need to experience the love of God.\n\nAnother message - and the main reason why this is an important song for parents, guardians and youth leaders to share - is that when a young woman engages in premarital sex, it isn't always about sex. I believe that, sadly, these lyrics ring true for many females:\n\nShe is yearning for shelter and affection\nThat she never found at home\nShe is searching for a hero to ride in\nTo ride in to save the day\nAnd in walks her Prince Charming\nAnd he knows just what to say\nMomentary lapse of reason\nAnd she gives herself away\n\nThis song is an enlightening truth for Christians with a message of hope for lost and lonely people.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Wow, I can't believe for the first time ever, I'm writing a review of a CD BASED on the remastering.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, The Beatles' entire catalog was re-released on CD, with new remasters by George Martin from the original tapes. Painstakingly remastered, they are now released in new digipack cases with booklets with exclusive photos and notes.\n\nFirst off, about the album itself, this is my favorite Beatles album right next to Revolver. All the songs are excellent. We have the catchy opener \"Help!\", the Ringo-sung \"Act Naturally\", hits like \"Ticket to Ride\" and McCartney's signature tune \"Yesterday\", the tongue-in-cheek \"You Like Me Too Much\" and the extremely catchy \"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\".\n\nAs for the remaster... HOLY FRIG! Seriously, this is the best version of the album. I had the 1990 release for a short time, but today I bought this and Sgt. Pepper. This remaster is, in every sense of the word, amazing. We have much clearer sound, no tape hiss at all like on the 1990 version, Paul's Rickenbacker bass really sticks out and thanks to this amazing remaster. These editions are to the Beatles what the 1998 remasters are to my favorite band, Iron Maiden.\n\nThe booklet is interesting too. One can expect lots of on-location photos since a movie was released from this album. And there are- quite a few screencaps actually, especially one of RIngo standing covered in blood in the water on a beach in the Bahamas. Having seen all episodes of the \"The Beatles ANthology\" Documentary miniseries, (I think it was) Ringo said that it was freezing cold down there, and they had to wear T-shirts as if it was extremely hot. I can imagine how hard it was to film that! (Apparently the shooting of the finale of \"Ichi the Killer\" on the climatic rooftop scene at the end had the same thing- extremely cold) The photos have subtitles desribing when and where the pictures were taken. There are also some historical notes on the album which are interesting to read, and a brief insight into the recording of the album from Mr. George Martin himself.\n\nIn short, even if you already own the entire Beatles catalogue, do not hesitate to buy the remasters, you will not believe your ears.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Weird Al Yankovic is famous (some would say, infamous) for his amazingly spot on and incredibly hilarious parodies of popular songs.  Learning from another famous satirist, Dr. Demento, Weird Al honed his craft with such notable parodies as \"Fat\" (Michael Jackson's \"Bad\"), \"Amish Paradise\" (Coolio's \"Gangta's Paradise\") and \"Saga Begins\" (the Star Wars: Episode I spoof of Don McLean's \"American Pie\").\n\n  However, none of this could prepare his fans for the astounding quality and success of his 2006 song, \"White and Nerdy\", which is a `re-imagining' of Chamillionaire's chart-topping hit \"Ridin'\".  Calling out every single nerd stereotype in the book (including having Seth Green and Donnie Osmond in the music video), Weird Al strikes fear in the heart of every gangsta, preppie, and cool kid, who would not want to be caught anywhere near him.\n\n  This hilarious song, whose video includes a scene of Al buying a black-market copy of the \"Star Wars Holiday Special\" in a back alley (nerds understand), was well-liked by Chamillionaire, who included it on his own official web site.  Also, in what might be a first, \"White and Nerdy\" became a Top 10 song spoofing a Top 10 song (it reached #9 on the Billboard Hot 100).  7 years later, it is still as much fun to watch as the first time.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"In late 2009 The Clipse returned on a new label, Columbia Records, to release \"Til The Casket Drops\". This album comes three years after their previous album \"Hell Hath No Fury\", an album that was the hip hop equivalent to Weezer's \"Pinkerton\"- a sophomore album that was superior to its predecessor, but had less than stellar sales. This time around, they are doing things a little different. For starters, The Neptunes, who produced all of their first two albums do eight of thirteen tracks. The remaining five songs are handled by Sean C & LV (\"Freedom\" and \"Never Will It Stop\") and Self Scientific member DJ Khalil (\"There Was A Murder\", \"Footsteps\" and the first single \"Kinda Like A Big Deal\"). Guests on this album are a little odd with Keri Hilson on \"All Eyes On Me\", Yo Gotti on \"Showing Out\" and Kenna (remember, he's a Neptunes affiliate) on \"Life Change\". The biggest WTF moment, however, is when the song \"Counseling\" comes on, it uses the refrain of...wait for it...Laura Branigan's \"Self Control\"!!?? It's a great but overly commercial effort from The Clipse, something I wouldn't have expected from them.","classification":5,"fold":1}

Beautiful deep, rich, analog sound and awesome to have these great live songs captured. I've listened to the first 8 sides and not a warp to be found. In fact, amazingly not even the slightest tick, pop, or crackle. Absolutely dead quiet on the lead ins and just a super high quality pressing. The book with the song by song descriptions by Tom Petty himself is just icing on the cake. Stellar release! One note, there apparently was an error using the original hype stickers listing 180g vinyl. These in fact weigh in (by other reports I've read) in the 150-160g range and are not 180g vinyl.

It's the person you wouldn't want your daughter to become, and yet there seems to be more and more of them coming of age.  It's scary.\n\nAnd the fact that it's so scary from the standpoint of society, makes this song great in that makes a funny distraction out of it for three minutes.\n\nIt's only afterwards that you realize that each time you play it, another vanity-obsessed person is born.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"With Miranda Lambert having developed a reputation as \"a bit of a rocker chick,\" her new trio with Ashley Monroe and Angaleena Presley provides an opportunity to indulge more of her East Texas country roots. The trio harmonizes in tight, veering lines that recall the Andrews Sisters, and trade opportunities to write and sing lead. Signed to Columbia, the production has Nashville production quality, but the backings include steel and acoustic guitar, and only occasionally venture into the contemporary country mold. The trio sings gritty songs of outlaw women leading rough lives of marital discord, family dysfunction, economic drought and bad habits. The latter hits a peak with the excess libations of the superbly not-ready-for-modern-country-radio \"Takin' Pills.\" Lambert can't help but shine, but she's clearly settled into the group vibe, sharing the spotlight with her friends and making this a balanced showcase of all three Annies' pistol-sharp singing and songwriting talent.

Manson, to his credit, still uses all sorts of voices for dramatic effect to get what he wants, but instead of hectic he goes for menacing. \"Killing Strangers,\" \"The Pale Emperor's\" pulsing opening cut, sounds like it slithered its way out of some hell-hounded biker bar, made even more so by Manson's insistence that \"we got guns, you better run\" growled in a nasty fashion. He's no longer tethered to a media that demands that he produce a hit \"single,\" leaving him to operate as an outsider of sorts in his advancing years.\n\nI mean that in a good way. The man who was once blamed for mass school shootings now plies his trade in TV and movies along with his music. (His multi-episode stint on \"Sons Of Anarchy\" was actually kind of funny.) So he can be, as he puts it himself, \"The Mephistopheles Of Los Angeles,\" all while sounding like he can still raise the devil when he wants to. He may sing that he's ready to meet his maker, but with \"The Pale Emporer,\" Marilyn Manson still makes like he could scare that man off for a few more rounds. It's also been said that much of the album's songs were single takes. All the better to grit and glitter you with.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"\"Hell on Heels\" is the debut album from Pistol Annies. This country super group features Miranda Lambert, Ashley Monroe, and Angaleena Presley. They are incredibly talented musicians, singers, and song writers, and anyone who listens will be impressed with their brand of country music. Their songs cover everything from domestic frustration (\"The Hunter's Wife\"), the female virtue (\"Beige\") and good ol' fashioned rebellion (\"Hell on Wheels\" and \"Takin' Pills\"). The music is awesome and features a classic country sound with some blues, honky-tonk and bluegrass influences. All three women share lead vocals on different parts of different songs, and the results are amazing. Their hooks are catchy, their harmonies and melodies are phenomenal, and the chemistry between them is perfect. This is definitely worth a listen!","classification":5,"fold":1}
{"text":"`Infestation' is the seventh studio album by legendary American Hair\/Sleaze metal band \"Ratt\". \"Infestation\" marks the return of \"Ratt\" as a recording band since the late 90s with the album being their first post-millennium work.\n\nThe 2010 line up of \"Ratt\" is put together by the three key original members: Iconic front man Stephen Pearcy, guitar legend Warren De martini and heavy hitter Bobby Blotzer; plus bassist Robbie Crane a member since 1997, and the latest addition, guitarist Carlos Cavazo.\nOn account of this latest recruit, personally I couldn't be happier; Having been the guitarist of Quite Riot( the original billboard-topping glam metal band) during their prime time,  he is as old school as the band requires. It is even more exciting to find out that Cavazo is not simply filling the guitarist position but he is given creative freedom and on that basis writes the first two songs on the tracklist including the single \"Best of Me\".\n\nCollectively the material on \"Infestation\" is awesome to say the least; This is probably the most confident, aggressive and definitely heavy work that \"Ratt\" have come up with. The two lead guitarists demonstrate their class throughout the album exchanging shredding solos and twin guitar harmonics while their opening riffs make evident reference to the first two album. Blodzer's performance is devastating, more than living up to his reputation as he includes all his signature licks and tempos. The bass never sounded heavier for the band than on \"Infestation\", as from the opening track to the closing Robbie's lines are perfectly audible and at times distorted. Finally Stephen Pearcy puts once again such a stellar vocal performance; His ability to throw in catchy phrases is as vivid as on their debut while his approach balances perfectly style and melody.\n\nOne can literally not get enough of this album; the guys have kept all the elements of the classic \"Ratt\" and made it heavier, more metallic with more guitar leads and upfront drumming than before. The sticker on the album case reads \"11 new Ratt classics\" and upon purchase I though the claim was quite exaggerative, yet it did not take more than one play of the CD to convince me that indeed every song on \"infestation\" is a potential classic. \"Infestation\" is probably going to prove a hard album for \"Ratt\" to top next time they enter the studio. Allow me to say this is by far my favourite album of \"Ratt\" to date.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"The mid-to-late Sixties was a strange and difficult time for many Blues men - most were without contracts, forgotten and under-appreciated. Then the Blues boom happened (particularly in the UK) and many had their careers kick-started all over again.\n\nFreddie King was no exception. His last album had been for Federal in 1964, but with a new lease of life on the mighty Atlantic label, he produced two much revered LPs in rapid succession. The first was \"Freddie King Is A Blues Master\" released in 1969 on SD 9004 - and then this peach - \"My Feeling For The Blues\" on Cotillion SD 9016 released in early 1970.\n\nThis 1991 Repertoire CD (REP 4170-WZ) is a straightforward transfer of that second 11-track album (36:03 minutes).\n\nAce saxophonist KING CURTIS produced the record - with all arrangements by Atlantic's newest soul protg DONNY HATHAWAY (except \"Woke Up This Morning\" which was Arranged by King Curtis).\n\nThe musicians for the sessions were:\nLead Guitar & Vocals - FREDDIE KING\nRhythm Guitar - CORNELL DUPREE\nTenor Saxophones - GEORGE COLEMAN and FRANK WESS\nTenor & Baritone Saxophones - TREVOR LAWRENCE and WILLE BRIDGES\nTrumpets - ERNIE ROYAL and MARTIN BANKS\nPiano - GEORGE STUBBS\nBass - JERRY JEMMOTT\nDrums - KEVIN RICE\n\"What'd I Say\" features Bass Marimba and Sax Solo by KING CURTIS\n\"You Don't Have To Go\" and \"The Things I Used To Do\" feature Harmonica by HUGH McCRACKEN\n\nThe 3-way foldout inlay has a brief but informative history of King's career by BERND MATHEJA that is sided on Page 3 by a selected Discography. Although licensed from East West, it doesn't advise who remastered what - but the sound quality is great nonetheless - clean, muscular and so enjoyable. Repertoire as a label has always had a good reputation when it comes to transfers.\n\nSide 1 opens with the down and dirty \"Yonder Wall\" which not surprisingly for the date it was recorded name-checks men coming home from the Vietnam War. It's followed by a cracking Freddie King instrumental called \"The Stumble\" - the kind of cool boppin' blues tune that turns up on those hip compilations you read about. \"I Wonder Why\" and \"Stormy Monday\" (BB King and Jimmy Witherspoon covers) get the brassy treatment like \"Yonder Wall\" to great effect, while Side 1 ends with a wonderful take on Willie Mabon's \"I Don't Know\" with the bass really forward and funky in the mix.\n\nSide 2 opens with a version of Ray Charles' \"What'd I Say\" that builds like the Atlantic original did, which is followed by one of my favourites, a fabulous soulful take on Jimmy Witherspoon's standard \"Ain't Nobody's Business What We Do\" (lyrics above). It's followed by a superb harmonica driven shuffle, a cover of Jimmy Reed's \"You Don't Have To Go\" which features Freddie giving it some funky blues - such a cool number.  The pace is then expertly changed to another \"...my baby is gone...\" song, a cover of B.B. King's \"Woke Up This Morning\" with punchy brass fills (you can so hear Hathaway's soulfulness in a lot of the arrangements).\n\nThis album has been reissued subsequently in 2008 by another company but apparently the sound isn't the greatest; the only other stop is the July 2009 Bear Family Box Set called \"Taking Care Of Business\" that covers everything from 1956 through to 1973 across 7 CDs and a Hardback Book - a Christmas treat I feel certain I'm going to allow myself.\n\nBorn in 1934, Freddie King suffered a heart attack whilst playing a Christmas concert in 1976 and passed away in hospital two days later. Name-checked by luminaries such as Eric Clapton and Peter Green, on hearing this totally forgotten peach of an album, it's easy to see why this bluesman is remembered with such affection.\n\nA nice CD and worth seeking out - next stop the bank-manager and Bear Family's stupendous box set...","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I can't believe I'm reviewing this only now, after having it in my possesion for all of these years.  I love this now as much as I did when I first got it, because back in this music period, this is when the best RnB singers were doing their thing and the music was at it's best (especially this Quiet Storm genre).  Keith Washington is so unbelievably under-rated and incredibly talented.  His music and his voice are incredible and this is one of my favourite RnB cds ever.  Are You Still In Love With Me and Closer, are fantastic songs that I still love to sing along with.  He sings with emotion and silkiness in his voice and if you love RnB, you should already own it - if you don't - go get this now.  He's great and on a very similar par with Peabo Bryson, Luther Vandross and Gerald Alston.  I highly recommend this to any Quiet Storm fan.","classification":5,"fold":1}

Apparently it comes from a time when band member Andy Hull was trying to piece his life back together.\n\n\"...What if I've been trying to get to where I've always been?\nWhat if we've been trying to get to where we've always been?\nSimple math\nBelieve me, all is brilliant\nWhat if we've been trying to kill the noise and silence?\nWhat if I was wrong and you had never questioned it?\nWhat if it was true, that all we thought was right was wrong?\nSimple math\nThe truth cannot be fractioned\nI imply, I've got to get it back then...\"\n\nThe band mates of Manchester Orchestra have crafted a powerful piece of music here.

{"text":"Back in the late 90's, we've seen a huge Latin explosion in the music industry. While there have been acts that have been more about hyppe, and less of heart and soul like Jennifer Lopez, who hasn't really been a credible singer lately, or Ricky Martin, who hasn't really made an English pop album in years who just made everyone say they were Livin' La Vida Loca so much, others made it because of their family bonds. That was the case with Enrique Iglesias. His family has had a enormous career with singing because of the triumphs of his father Julio, and his sibling Julio Iglesias Jr., who has a moderate career in English a few years ago. But, it is hard to believe that it has been nearly 10 years, and Enrique has been the last Latin crossoverof the 90's act standing today. Now, his English music career is celebrated with a new hits collection.\n\nEnrique Iglesias 2008 Greatest Hits, is a single disc reflection of his biggest ballads and seducing women to dance, that spans his 1st decade of success. The collection is noble, and a simple reintroduction to what he has brought to the table. The songs have all been remastered well, and include his boldest songs. All the hits are here from his seductive dance smashes like Bailamos and Rhythm Divine, to his intimate ballads such as Hero and the overlooked and seductive Could I Have This Kiss Forever with Whitney Houston. There are a few new songs here that really lack a bit of chemistry though, that miss the mark by a longshot including Away with Sean Garrett, and Takin' back My Love with Ciara, which feels like it is lacking soul and heart. That is something you haven't yet heard from Enrique, and that makes the new songs feel more like a turnoff than a starter for love and games in bed.\n\nStill, despite those new tracks which feel more like a drag than seductive starters, Enrique Iglesias Greatest Hits isn't a bad buy for hard core fans, but mostly could've had a bit more for those who haven't yet heard any of his standards at all. While it isn't a bad purchase, I just was honestly hoping for a bit more to say that the rhythm was more divine to.\n\nAlbum Cover: B\n\nSongs: C+\n\nPrice: B-\n\nRemastering: B\n\nOverall: C+","classification":3,"fold":1}

It came on the heels of the Persian Gulf War, and hearing how bold and somber it is, sadly after Whitney had died, it is a unparalleled trademark of why someone is that strong. Whitney dominated that song beyond what words could've ever said, and that lightning in a bottle will never be replicated. I will never get over the sadness I feel without hearing the voice of our times pass on. Whitney Houston will be missed, and definitively never forgotten.\n\nWhitney Houston 1963-2012\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":1}

Nothing here on the Beyonce' self-titled black album really delivers either. Pretty Hurts, the fourth single from her album doesn't actually ignite as a ballad.

{"text":"Oh how I wanted this album to be a great one. I never expect masterpieces;that word is bandied about far too much anything. Being one of those people who really appreciate and loved John's send up of 70's funky soul on<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Once-Again\/dp\/B000HCPWZO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Once Again<\/a>&nbsp;it was an extension on this direction,whether it be toward fusion ,blues\/rock or even disco-funk would've seemed logical. This is the same Legend\/Kayne West collaboration that made the first two albums what they were. Meanwhile John's \"evolution\" was unexpected but wasn't particularly focused on his musical strenghs. The emphasis here is definately on a variation of British Two-step,which is very over done by this point much the same new jack swing was by about 1996. Not only that but the ballads that are here have...a very processed and static folk-rock flavor if you can imagine such a thing happening. That's not to say this album doesn't have a handfull of high quality songs. \"Good Morning\",a song that starts as an intro and continues later into an actual song that has this great rise n shine R&B feel with the nice touch of horns on the accent. The song \"Greenlight\",featuring Andre 3000 manages a good comobo of two step and 80's funk with Andre hillariously noting \"even Stevie Wonder got down sometimes\". The Kayne West collaboration \"It's Over\" is by far the funkiest thing on the album and very nimble with it's use of electronics. This naked funk send up was a wonderful possible direction for the rest of the album but it wasn't quite that way. With the exception of the equally wonderful duet with Brandy on \"Quickly\" and the epic modern people music of \"If You're Not There\" a lot of this album,up and down tempo is lacking in a certain vitality and spark. Considering this includes a bonus disk about the making of this album I can tell a lot went into making this and perhaps that was the problem. \"Satisfaction\" and \"Everybody Knows\",while very good songs seemed as if they were third and fourth guessed and some labored elements of the production make it clear if your doing something soulful and funky,it doesn't have the proper effect if everything is overworked. I will not condemn John Legend for trying some new ideas and,considering how obviously inspired by Jeff Buckly he is the rockier direction in some of this production is not surprising. At the same time a looser feel might've better benifited the intentions a little bit better. John's persona is elegant but not stiff and,considering he's only on his third album and is due a somewhat less powerful one the future still has a lot of brightness in it for John Legend.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Say what you want about Nickelback, they're one of, if not the most popular rock group today. And their \"most annoying\" is their best song. The song is basically wanting the life of a Rockstar, which Nickelback is, so... not the most original theme. In fact, this song is more cliched than a international South Park cartoon character. But, what makes the song is the catchiness. You'll have it stuck in your head whether you like it or not, and soon, in the middle of a crowded elevator, you'll start singing, \"I'm going to pop my pills with a pez dispenser.\" This may of course cause you much embarrassment, and will cause you to smash your radio. But in the end, it's a rock song, and Nickelback's best rock song, and maybe best song period. I'm not saying it's a great song, just Nickelback's best song, because it's so darn catchy.\n\nOverall, there are many warnings to give before getting this song, and they are too numerous to name here. So, be warned, you might not like, or get out of your head, what you hear.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"\"Smoke on the Water,\" originally from the great Deep Purple album \"Machine Head,\" has one of the most iconic riffs in all of rock courtesy of Ritchie Blackmore and his Strat. Easily the most recognizable and popular song from Deep Purple's catalogue, the song chronicles an actual event. In December 1971 Deep Purple was in Montreux, Switzerland to record an album at the Montreux Casino next to Lake Geneva using mobile recording equipment owned by the Rolling Stones. During a Frank Zappa concert on December 4, a fan set off a flare gun, setting the ceiling on fire and burning the complex to the ground. The flames and smoke drifted over the lake, while the members of Deep Purple watched. The band then had to scramble for a venue to record \"Machine Head\" in, and finally settled on the Montreux Grand Hotel. The song is quite an accurate piece of history, and definitely one of the heaviest, most listenable pieces of musical history ever recorded.\n\nThe song has appeared in various versions (the most amusing is from Pat Boone's \"In a Metal Mood,\" with Blackmore reprising his role on guitar) on many albums. I recommend \"Machine Head,\" but the \"Best Hits\" album is also a good buy at a reasonable price. One thing's certain, though: no musical library should be without this staple.","classification":5,"fold":1}
{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"\"Partners\" is Barbra Streisand's 34th studio album for Columbia Records and is simply outstanding. Compared with some of her previous efforts in the last three of four years \"Partners\" stands above all those recordings because Barbra sounds magnificent and outstanding on this CD.\n\n The album features Barbra singing many familiar songs (especially those made famous by Streisand herself) with some of the biggest male singers of our time. Highlights here include \"People\" with Stevie Wonder\", \"It Had to Be You\\' with my favorite male singer currently Michael Buble, and \"The Way We Were\" with Baby Face\". My personal favrite track though is her first ever recording with her son Jason Gould on \"How Deep Is The Ocean?\".\n\n Barbra's voice blends beautifully on all these duets and what is interesting is that all the male singers agreed to do the songs on Barbra's first call to them proving the respect Streisand rightfully deserves.\n\n Sit back, pour yourself a glass of good wine and play this CD...you will not be disappointed. Barbra is back with some old songs done in a new way, a way in which Barbra can only do it.\n\n In its first week of release \"Partners\" made pop music history selling 196,000 copies and hitting #1 on the Billboard Album's Chart. This makes Barbra Streisand the ONLY artist in music history to have a #1 album in the past six decades! \"Partners\" is Barbra's 10th #1 album.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Tron: Legacy is a very belated sequel to the 1982 science fiction classic Tron, which starred Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner and introduced audiences to what were then state-of-the-art computer graphics in a story about a computer programmer named Flynn who gets sucked into his own software programme and is forced to take part in vicious gladiatorial games by the omnipotent Master Control Program. The sequel, which is directed by Joseph Kosinski, sees Flynn's son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) suffer the same fate as his father, albeit 20 years later, when he receives a mysterious message from his father's old video game arcade and subsequently becomes trapped in the same digital world - which in the intervening years has become bigger, more visually stunning, and much more dangerous. With the help of a beautiful warrior named Quorra, Kevin must traverse this astonishing landscape and find a way home. The film, which stars Olivia Wilde and Michael Sheen and sees both Bridges and Boxleitner reprising their original roles, is Disney's big movie for Christmas 2010, and features an original score by Daft Punk.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with their history, Daft Punk is a French electronic music duo comprising composer-musicians Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. They first emerged as part of the French house music scene in the early 1990s and became hugely influential and successful, eventually going on to enjoy chart hits such as \"Da Funk\", \"Around the World\" and \"Harder Better Faster Stronger\". Their gimmick is that the pair of them wear stylized crash helmets and futuristic body suits on stage, giving them a sort of detached, other-worldly public persona a little like the Blue Man Group, or what Slipknot used to do in the hard rock scene. Bangalter has previous film music experience, having scored the extremely controversial French film Irrversible as a solo composer in 2002, but this is the first time Daft Punk, as a group, has scored a film.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Wendy Carlos, who scored the original Tron, Daft Punk have expanded their electronic palette to include a 90-piece symphony orchestra recorded in London. The resulting sound is immense. Many readers may be under the impression that I don't like electronic scores, but I can categorically say that this is not the case. I like electronic scores when they have a reason to be electronic, not when synthesizers are simply used to double up or (even worse) imitate on an orchestra. With its overarching themes of the human world being invaded and overtaken by its digital counterpart, Tron: Legacy has a reason to be electronic, and Daft Punk's skilful merging of the two musical palettes is one of the most engaging things about this excellent score.\n\nIn terms of the stylistics of the electronic music, there's a little bit of John Carpenter, a little bit of Brad Fiedel, a little bit of Vangelis, and (obviously) a little bit of Wendy Carlos, all mashed together and filtered through Daft Punk's high energy rhythmic sensibility, but with a larger scope and a greater lyricism than any of these other pioneering electronic composers brought to their scores. There are no direct statements of any of Carlos's thematic work on the original Tron, but her fingerprints are everywhere, and I have to say that this is some of the best synth writing I have heard in a film score in years. It becomes even better when it mixes with the large-scale symphonic forces provided by the London orchestra, which humanizes and warms the electronic tones, giving them an emotional center and a great deal of power and gravitas.\n\nMany will inevitably compare this music to that of Hans Zimmer, especially his recent score for Inception (listen to \"Recognizer\"), but while the orchestral tones are similar in their chord progressions and rhythmic ideas, the electronics have a sophistication way beyond anything anyone from Remote Control has shown to date. The multiplicity of tones, sample types, and nostalgic throwbacks to the synth sounds of the 1980s give the electronic parts of Tron: Legacy a depth and variety almost never heard in scores of this type. Whereas Zimmer and company often limit the scope of their electronic palette, Daft Punk opens theirs up to encompass a massive range.\n\nThe opening \"Overture\" introduces the main theme of the film, a heroic piece which has a vague similarity to Aaron Copland's classic piece Fanfare for the Common Man. \"The Grid\" features some stirring and dramatic narration by Jeff Bridges (the only cue to do so), which builds to an alien-sounding but wonderfully effective statement of the main theme. In the score's conclusive cues - \"C.L.U\", \"Flynn Lives\" and the \"Finale\" - the theme reaches appropriately epic proportions, while in the \"End Titles\" cue the theme is accompanied by a modern, driving, defiantly upbeat electronic accompaniment which is simply terrific. There is even room for a conventionally attractive classical love theme, \"Adagio for Tron\", which features an absolutely gorgeous cello solo, before going on to pick up a bubbling electronic undercurrent during its second half.\n\nThe action music is busy and powerful, with thunderous cues like \"Rinzler\", \"The Game Has Changed\", \"Fall\" and \"Disc Wars\" building layer upon layer of propulsive electronic sound design and booming percussion hits over a bed of churning, endlessly moving string lines. \"Outlands\" has a terrific Don Davis-style fading brass effect towards the end of the cue, while \"Rectifier\" has portentous horn blasts and an ominous, I'm-coming-to-get-you string figure which sounds more like something Elliot Goldenthal would write, and has a wonderful, palpable sense of danger. The moments of pure electronica - \"The Son of Flynn\", \"Armory\", the Terminator-like \"Arena\", the groovy \"End of Line\", the aggressive and highly-charged \"Derezzed\", the unexpectedly graceful \"Solar Sailer\" - are fascinating, and often have a mesmerizing dream-like ambience which is astonishingly effective. Some of these cues have the same hypnotic, euphoric aura that 1990s trance music had, which makes perfect sense considering Bangalter and Homem-Christo's respective backgrounds.\n\nKnowing me and my tastes, Tron: Legacy is the last score you would expect me to praise, but there's something about Daft Punk's music here which is immensely engaging and interesting. Maybe it's the sense of freedom and lack of cynicism that composers new to film music always seem to have, being let loose in an exciting new world. Maybe it's their total commitment to the project, and their obvious thrill at being able to incorporate an orchestra into their music for the first time which makes things so appealing. Their electronic sound design is so fresh and lively when compared to the tired old samples we have grown accustomed to hearing over the last few years. And while their orchestral writing is certainly not groundbreaking in any way, it has a pleasing tonality and an appropriately grand scale which makes it very easy to enjoy. It's unlikely to win any awards, but in this case it really doesn't matter: this is one of my favorite scores of the year, and I'm as surprised to be typing that line as I'm sure you are to be reading it.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"If there is honestly one thing that I do adore about Sting, is that has been a master artist at really making great songs on his own. He has been doing it for 30 years on his own, and nearly 40 years as a part of The Police. I do however find his solo work to really deliver nicely from Jazz and Soul to all the way to Rock. But when he has a song come out, people will really listen to him, most of the time. When it came down to his Brand New Day album in 1999, many people weren't very eager at listening to the album at first, after the title track was released. However when Desert Rose was released as a single, many people really flocked over to the album. Desert Rose from the Brand New Day album is one of those hypnotic songs of Sting's that is soulful and very hypnotic to his work. I definitely think it is one of his Top 5 songs to have ever came out in the 90's. Next to If I Ever Lose Me Faith In You and Fields Of Gold. This is one song that I definitely recommend downloading if you are a Sting fan.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"This is the first song that Rihanna has done that I actually feel is sincere in its presentation. I'm not a fan, by any means, so I could be wrong but this song, for me, is a real glimpse into the mind of Rihanna as an artist. It's so muted and understated, like it's a soliloquy or a journal entry or even a thought, too quiet for words but real and cutting as your mind contemplates... This is new territory when it comes to Rihanna's usual 'I'm a tough chick' deal. It's vulnerable and painful and the perfect blend of harmony and chaos, the harmony of the vocals, the chaos of a broken heart and the unwillingness to let go of the only thing keeping you afloat. If Rihanna decided to do more music similar to this, I would happily reconsider my stance as a non-fan but for now, I'm happy to have this ode to a love lost rather than not have it at all.

After that, NONPOINT fell under the radar, and released two disappointing albums, VENGEANCE and MIRACLE. They were OK, but didn't have the bite that NONPOINT is usually known for. Their newly-released self-titled album regains that power, and the problems that plagued the previous two albums are very little. You have the radio-friendly vibe of DEVELOPMENT, the agressive nu-metal hooks of STATEMENT and TO THE PAIN, the variety of RECOIL, and the metal-like aspects of VENGEANCE and MIRACLE, all bundled together in a 12-song review of NONPOINT'S musical journey. This record is also somehow heavier than the previous albums, and has much more obtrusive production courtesy of JOHNNY K, who has worked with STAIND, SEVENDUST, and DISTURBED.

{"text":"There are several reasons why the digitally-remastered edtion of this classy duet hit by Stan Getz and Joao Gilberto belongs in the MP3 Department is that it has two for three bonus tracks, the music is restored in it's own brilliant decor and you get to hear the entire edition of Best Of Two Worlds in it's complet format from start to finish.  Even though Amazon.com have included his Columbia Records output (1972-79) in the MP3 Department, they may have missed out on the remastered edition of this time-honoured classic that many of us believe truly deserve to be part of.

Chicken in the Pen isn't a subtle song and you should never be in a lazy mood and suddenly have this tune come at ya!  It wasn't a great opener.  The Mirror track nine is so beautiful you have to wonder why Kid Rock doesn't attempt more civility and passivity in his songs; they tend to be the most special ones.  Of course, we all love Kid Rock rocking out and it's gotten to the point that provocative lyrics are the norm for him and really lose the shock value.  Nonetheless I love Kid Rock and I really like this cd if for no other reason it's Kid Rock \"rocking out\" and nobody does this quite as well as he does.  Rock and Roll Jesus was \"absolute brilliance\" and a cherished cd in my collection although skipped up from overplaying it and I must get another one.  This CD sadly does not come close to Rock and Roll Jesus and if Kid Rock really wants a killer next cd he has to take the time to be thoughtful and innovative because he has proven he is capable of brilliance and we need more of that from him.  Get this though and give it loads of listens; I just know this one will grow on me.","classification":5,"fold":1}

Not only dealing with the trial in regards to the deaths of her mother and nephew, but also the travesty and deviating death of Whitney Houston. Musically though, she is showing she still has a voice with the title track to Think Like A Man. The collaboration with Rick Ross & Ne-Yo though isn't really the best at game. While Jennifer has the chops and shows it well, it would've been a bit better if there was more chemistry between the three of them in the song. I was really surprised in the song. I do hope there are better songs that Jennifer can pull out of her voice soon.

There are NOT 100 concertos here, but 35 (or different pieces I should say because some of the music included here is not a Piano Concerto, and another piece is incomplete -Mozart's K365). See my detailed list below. Amazon offers this collection of music for free to Amazon Prime members, which I am very grateful for. If you are not an Amazon Prime member, I strongly encourage you to buy this collection of music anyway. This is a very cheap album with so much joy in it! If you don't particularly like the versions included in here, you can dig deeper and find a better version on youtube or buy a CD of the concerto with your favorite piano player and\/or orchestra-director of your choice. There is always going to be some customers (me included) who are missing something in here (for example Rahmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3, one of my favorite ones, is not included here). Despite of that, the collection includes essentials such as Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 5, Tchaikovsky No 1, Brahms No. 2, etc. etc. etc. I have taken the time to include all the concertos included in this collection WITH the name of the composers for every piece. This is something Amazon does not care much to include, as I have complained in other reviews of mine, so someone (me in this case) has to take the time and include the information which I believe is very helpful.

Kely, recording into a duet with the songstress of her song I Look To You, it strikingly does not add up. The song was beautiful beyond whatever words could be expressed when it first came out, when the world lost Michael Jackson and Senator Ted Kennedy passed on. Instead, the painting is more somber than intimate into Whitney's exquisite style. It really wasn't as strong and more sad, to the voice in content. It isn't a bad download for die hard Whitney fans, but for those new to her voice, I would suggest the original one that Whitney made from I Look To You in 2009 instead.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":1}

If they do and they are selling them to make a BIG profit, that is down right mean.\n\nThis song, says that even if I'm not healed, Jesus is still Lord of my life.

He's strengthen me internally to look thru the end of a wrapping paper card board tube to where there is a healing white light, which is Jesus.  Negative images, negative stories about other people's condition, about anything negative bounce off that cardboard and I don't hear it.  Only the encouraging and the positive come through.

{"text":"\"Hell on Heels\" is the debut album from Pistol Annies. This country super group features Miranda Lambert, Ashley Monroe, and Angaleena Presley. They are incredibly talented musicians, singers, and song writers, and anyone who listens will be impressed with their brand of country music. Their songs cover everything from domestic frustration (\"The Hunter's Wife\"), the female virtue (\"Beige\") and good ol' fashioned rebellion (\"Hell on Wheels\" and \"Takin' Pills\"). The music is awesome and features a classic country sound with some blues, honky-tonk and bluegrass influences. All three women share lead vocals on different parts of different songs, and the results are amazing. Their hooks are catchy, their harmonies and melodies are phenomenal, and the chemistry between them is perfect. This is definitely worth a listen!","classification":5,"fold":1}
{"text":"I'm going to miss Tom Petty. His melodic, honest, direct and intelligent brand of rock music seems to be fading away. These series of concerts recorded from the early 80's through 2008, are an excellent document of a working band. Petty and The Heartbreakers are all in top form here.\n\nI was at one of the shows that was included here (it was Tom Petty's week long residency at the Fillmore) and the atmosphere can positively be felt as the band's music rumbles throughout the speakers. The CDs are housed in cardboard sleeves with the songs listed on the back. All of these come in a nicely designed cardboard box and includes a booklet with comments from the late Petty about the concerts.\n\nThis is a nice summary of the band's live performances similar to Springsteen's boxed set released back in 1984 but, for me, this works so much better (and it is less expensive as well continuing to show Petty's commitment to not ripping off his fans).","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Kashmir is an undisputed classic. The band members themselves have acknowledged that this song best expressed their vision.\n\nIt opens with a crash of cymbal with a waltzing 3\/4 string\/guitar progression accompanied by a 4\/4 drum pattern. It's what makes the song so interesting, this confluence of different time streams. Keeps things slightly tipsy. Personally, I cannot hear the opening of Kashmir without also being aware of the ending of Trampled Underfoot, the song that precedes it on the album. It is a fleeting moment, but it's there in my brain.\n\nMy favorite part of the song is the minimalist section that lasts from 2:18-3:14; there is so much breathing room in it, Bonham's drums combined with the bass and the descending string slides. Very seductive.\n\nKashmir has a circular theme that rotates around its axis with precision, sections linking up with each other like clockwork. Nice flanging and phasing here and there, mostly on the drum flurries; e.g., 7:50.\n\nMost fans probably know the scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High when Ratner is instructed by Damone to play side one of Led Zeppelin IV, but he 'messes up' by playing Physical Graffiti instead. We all know that any Zeppelin album would make a good choice. Well, maybe not side two of In Through the Out Door. So much has been written about this song, you can find many online treatises that analyze its brilliance. I prefer to let it all wash over me like an oasis in the desert.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Doubtlessly the most famous and influential album of the '90s. If you honestly don't know the story behind it, here's how it goes: Nirvana kicked around for a while under several different names in the late '80s, going through several personnel changes before deciding on a lineup of Kurt Cobain (guitar\/vocals), Krist Novoselic (bass) and Chad Channing (drums) getting signed on a minor label in 1988 and putting out their debut album, Bleach (famously recorded for $600) in 1989. Most people don't own it.\nSomewhere in the interim, Nirvana picked up Dave Grohl, signed with Geffen records, and enlisted producer Butch Vig to work on their second album, Nevermind. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was released as the lead-off single, meant to get Nirvana across to the coveted college radio market. The hope was that the follow-up single \"Come As You Are\" would cross Nirvana over to a mainstream audience. Maybe, just maybe, they would be a moderately popular group.\nNext thing the group knew, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was a worldwide smash, Nevermind was riding high on the charts and taking home all kinds of critical acclaim, and hair metal was dying out. Suddenly, the world of rock would never be the same again. If it weren't for this, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Stone Temple Pilots, Smashing Pumpkins, Green Day, and pretty much every other popular American rock group from the era you could name probably wouldn't have anywhere near the success they enjoy now. Cobain was a celebrity, and Butch Vig became huge in his own right - he went on to produce another '90s milestone, Smashing Pumpkins' Siamese Dream.\nSo I just spent three paragraphs giving history. You're probably wondering what the album's like. Well, on a whole it's good. The singles are fantastic: \"Teen Spirit\"'s wall of loud, distorted, but melodic guitars, dynamic shifts, and massive chorus have made it an anthem for children of the '90s such as me; \"Come As You Are\" matches a watery bass riff with intelligent lyrics about stardom; \"In Bloom\" is a biting criticism of brain-dead rock fans with a brilliant video and pounding drums; and my favorite, \"Lithium\", cross-breeds a surprisingly jazzy rhythm, disturbing lyrics, and a giant emotional release in the refrain. And it's not just the singles, either. There's a string of fine rockers - \"Breed\", \"Drain You\", \"Lounge Act\", \"On a Plain\" - a stark, controversial sex abuse protest, \"Polly\" (creepiest lyric: \"Polly says her back hurts, and she's just as bored as me\"), and my friend's favorite, the mesmeric, gently swaying ballad \"Something in the Way\". Plus the pure mayhem of the hidden track, \"Endless Nameless\" (with Kurt giving us such insightful proclamations as \"YEEAREARH!!!\" and \"BLAAARGH!\") is awesome. Dave and Krist provide steady backing and really step up to the plate on tracks like \"In Bloom\" (Dave), \"Lounge Act\" (Krist), and \"Lithium\" (both of 'em). And Kurt's sense of melody never deserts him. But some of it is weak. Sure, when I'm in the mood I can relate to the pure anger of \"Stay Away\" (with a frightening chorus), but other times it just bores me. And I don't like \"Territorial P***ings\" at all. It's bad, just about unlistenable in fact.\nVirtually everyone knows what happened next: Nirvana put out one album (In Utero, which in my opinion is the group's masterpiece), then Kurt killed himself. Which is a shame, because I would've loved to have met him. I read an interview with him, and he struck me as a caring, down-to-earth guy genuinely interested in music, rather than money. He actually detested this album because of its production, which he thought was too commercial. Plus he didn't want racists, sexists or homophobes buying his records, which kicks total butt in my mind, especially when you consider how many rock stars are racists, sexists or homophobes themselves (or all three, in the case of that wonderful, gentlemanly philanthropist Axl Rose).\nIn conclusion, Nevermind is a fine album - Motley Crue, Bon Jovi and Poison combined couldn't make anything a fraction as good. But there are better in the Nirvana catalog. This is probably the most accessible of their albums, but I'd recommend you get In Utero as well, since as I said I think it's a far better album, though it's also REALLY harsh and noisy. Unplugged in New York is also a classic, tied with Bob Marley's Babylon By Bus as my favorite live album of all time. So while Nevermind isn't a bad purchase by any means, you could do much better. If you like this album's sound, I'd also point you towards Pearl Jam's Ten, Soundgarden's Bandmotorfinger and Superunknown, Smashing Pumpkins' Siamese Dream, Stone Temple Pilots' Core and Purple, Alice in Chains' Dirt, and several others I can't think of right now. The early '90s were a great era for rock music, probably better than anything but the classic 1965-1975 epoch, and while this is the definitive album of the time period, it's pretty far from the best.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"As far as Katy Perry goes, 'Hot and Cold' is, IMO, a better song than 'I Kissed A Girl'.  The initial appeal of 'Kissed A Girl' was the shock value...which was somewhat clever and creative...but that's about as far as the song went.\n\nThe groove is stronger, and the chorus has a better melody for Katy to showcase her vocals.  I'm not saying she's the greatest singer in the world or anything close to it, but this song is much less likely to become old like 'Kissed A Girl' did.  I was tired of that one after just a few weeks.\n\nI think the fact that this song is not as \"catchy\" is actually in its favor...when long-term listening is factored in.  I don't think it will be on the charts as long, and therefore won't be as overplayed.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"On this double album, nearly all genres of music are represented from classic rock to country and dance. This album is worth supporting for two reasons. The first, most of the profits will go to help the victims of the tsunami and earthquake in Japan and this is a great way of donating your money and receiving a token of appreciation in return. Secondly, there are some great gems including a reworked live version of Sting's classic \"Fragile\" , Lady Antebellum's balled \"I Run to You\" as well as Ne-Yo latest single \"One in a Million.\"\n\nThe one criticism I have regarding the tracklisting is that there is a large proportion of older hits that many of us probably already have. Imagine if the record companies had included an exclusive remix to the Black Eyed Peas latest single \"Just Can't Get Enough\" (the video of which was filmed in Tokyo a week before the Earthquake)instead of \"One Tribe.\" Or included the elusive Japan-only cd remix to Rihanna's hit \"Only Girl in the World (Bimbo Jones mix)\" instead of the regular album version that is already featured on countless other compilations... This would have boosted sales for this very worthy cause. I do applaud the artists and record companies for putting aside their egos and coming together.","classification":4,"fold":1}

I wanted another \"Heart Of Stone\" or \"It's A Man's World. Believe showed Cher in great vocal form from previous recordings. The songs suited her to a tee (with the exception of \"We All Sleep Alone\", a real nightmare!) and the production was quite good.\nMy big surprise was the amount of careful work that went into this followup. The only reason this cd doesn't rate a \"5\" in my opinion is that she could have done it entirely without vocoder effects and it would have still been great. After all, I buy her music to hear HER.\n\"Song For The Lonely\" will be as big, if not bigger, than Believe. And there are several potentials for Top 10 to follow. Check out the infectious \"Different Kind Of Love Song\", the haunting \"Rain Rain\", anthemic \"Alive Again\", the 70's  disco \"Love Is A Lonely Place Without You\", and a great cover of \"Love One Another\".

{"text":"I recently saw Frazey Ford in concert (more on that later). The (erstwhile?) member of the great Be Good Tanyas has been quite active since the Be Good Tanyas went on (forever?) hiatus in 2007. Ford issued a well-received solo album in 2010 with \"Obadiah' and the followed that up with this album in 2014.\n\n\"Indian Ocean\" (11 tracks including the \"hidden\" bonus track; 47 min.)  opens with \"September Fields\", about as accessible as anything Ford has done before. Immediately apparent in the sound are the warm horns. Turns out this is non other than the legendary Hi Rhythm Section, holy cow! Things slow down a bit on \"You're Free\". The album has a pretty nice overall R&B feel to it, check out \"Done\" (1st radio single) as a great example. Side B opens with the deceptively slow \"You Got Religion\". Another highlight deeper into the album is the hard-charging \"Natural Law\". But it all leads to the epic (and album-closing) title track, a 6+ min. journey (with observations like \"You come again and again\/And you, you're sorry\/You're sorry\/For what you've done\"). The \"hidden track \"September Fields\" is an acoustic version of the album's opening song, just Frazey and her guitar. Bottom line: this is a delightful album on many levels. I have no idea whether the Be Good Tanyas will ever come together again, but it's clear that Frazey Ford has found her own path and voice.\n\nJust this past weekend I saw Frazey Ford in concert at the beautiful Nelsonville Music Fest here in Ohio. Ford and her band played an hour long set in the late afternoon on the main stage, and the crowd absolutely loved her. She played mostly from \"Indian Ocean\" but also a couple of tunes that I didn't recognize and am quite certain these are new songs. Given that it took her 4 years between the first and second solo album, here's hoping we'll get a new album next year (at the latest!). If you have a chance to see Frazey Ford live, don't miss her!","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Edit: Sept 3. 2013, just noticed sampler has a price.\nFree mp3 download from Tad's Record of mostly reggae.\n\nTrack 1 The late great Gregory Isaacs with [song title]. Old style reggae song w\/simple beat, simple lyrics with modern content. Isaacs was a giant of Reggae this is a clean simple example of his work. He has much more music to try. [song title] is owned by AOL.\n\nAnthony B. (Keith Blair) and Tosh are next with Sleeping In The Rain. Another old style sounding descriptive simple lyrics and backing tune. Song title features throughout the song. Singer doing a little more. Not bad.\n\nGreen Grass by Jah Cure. Man with a history providing a more intense reggae experience. Vocal rich, strong song suits Jah Cure's persona. Nice song.\n\nTrack 4 I-Octane with My Life. Cool modern up beat song. Chatty with neat lyrical and musical hooks. Nothing fancy like it.\n\nBuju Banton plays Time & Place. Hugely successful reggae singer with more than average amount of notoriety in his life. This song rocks as reggae rocks. Strong song, Marley opening that builds vocal and strolls to the end. Very cool.\n\nCome Into My Room by Mavado feat. Stacious. Very cool fusion of reggae and RnB female and male vocal jousting on great track. Sexy and strong.\n\nHezron & Shaggy play Two Places. Great song, both artists singing around, through and with each other. Two styles merge very well on this very nice tune. Like it.\n\nTrack 8 is Cake Soap by Vybz Kartel. A man with a lot going on including producing this very cool song. Great backing sounds, up beat track. Very nice.\n\nBeenie Man & Fambo with I'm Drinking\/Rum & Red Bull. Great drinking song chorus is the key. What's not to like.\n\nRichie Spice play Yap Yap. One of the Bonner brothers playing neat well structured reggae pop song. Like it a lot.\n\nNo Games by Serani is next. Genre maybe Dancehall w\/reggae in the mix. Straining vocal over neat backing noise. Under 3 minutes, short and sweet. Like it.\n\nLast track is Perfect with Hand Cart Bwoy. Great Ska opening and strong roots sound on this rollin' song. Great track.\n\nMostly Reggae some Dancehall (I dunno) free mp3 download from Tad's Record. No Bob Marley covers, some very cool tracks and some okay songs.\n\nIf you are in the mood download onto your massive hard drive, be warned some of these Amazon samplers last 30 days before they are withdrawn or made for sale.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"THE BAND: Steve Harris (bass), Bruce Dickinson (vocals), Dave Murray (guitar), Adrian Smith (guitar), Nicko McBrain (drums).\n\nTHE DISC: (1986) 8 tracks clocking in at approximately 52 minutes. This is Maiden's 6th album. The 3rd release in a row to be recorded at Compass Point in Nassau, Bahamas. The disc contains a 22-page booklet with a brief intro, lyrics, band pictures and thank you's. Song writing credits: Harris with 5 songs (one co-written with Murray), and Adrian Smith with 3 songs all to himself. The enhanced CD features a nice multimedia section for your PC - including 2 videos (\"Wasted Years\" and \"Stranger In A Strange Land\"), the band's catalogue of albums, band history, family tree, itinerary from the '86-'87 Somewhere On Tour, and more. Digitally remastered in 1998. Cover art by the one and only Derek Riggs.\n\nCOMMENTS: \"Powerslave\", \"Piece Of Mind\" and \"Number Of The Beast\" are my 3 favorite Maiden albums. \"Somewhere In Time\" is a great release, but I put it on that 2nd tier of Maiden discs - along with \"7th Son\", \"Brave New World\" and \"Killers\". Close at 5-stars, but not quite. But since I can't rate it at 4.5, 5 will have to do here... only because a very good album from Maiden is still light years ahead of so much of the other crap that's out there (past and present). Prior to \"Somewhere\" Maiden had released 5 albums in 5 years. Extensive touring for the \"Powerslave\" tour followed by some much needed time off pushed this release back a year to 1986. I also read that at the time, this was their most expensive and most time consuming album to date (many tracks were rehashed and then hashed again). \"Wasted Years\" is my favorite song on the disc and perhaps my all-time favorite song penned by guitarist Adrian Smith. \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" and the 8+ minute \"Alexander The Great\" are simply classic hard driving metal songs that only Iron Maiden could deliver. Though a decent song, \"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\" is in my opinion the weakest song here. With Maiden's previous 3 albums being so strong, I'd go so far as saying this is my least favorite song the band has put out in 5 years. Also new on \"Somewhere\" was the introduction of the bass and guitar 'Synth' - giving the entire album a slightly different feel. The only other comment I can make is - where did Bruce Dickinson disappear to on the writing credits? All the albums he's appeared on with Maiden he's always written or at least shared in the writing of their songs. No credits for Bruce here. Not sure why - his solo career was years away in the mid 90's. The band pictures of the group sitting in that futuristic blue car are pure cheese. \"Somewhere In Time\" ranks 4th on my list of favorites from Maiden. And, still very much essential to the music library.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Music can inflame the soul, spark the imagination, move you into action, and give you the sense that you can take a leap of faith and overcome the world.  Just listen to the first track of this album, and you will know what I am talking about.  It starts out low, with a pulse, a cello and piano playing around with the theme, back and forth, then the vocals come in and lift you to that angelic realm, your spine starts to tingle with excitement and you know that you will be able to overcome anything, with the help of God, that you set your mind on.  It becomes a powerful, heroic theme, and you can imagine the hero, or heroine, facing with courage the obstacles that they must overcome.  It ends with the piano, bells, and a deep electronic pulse that brings you back down to earth.  The first track has the title, Descent Back To Earth.  This is the first album I have downloaded from Future World Music, and I rank them up there with Audiomachine for some powerful, epic, and exciting music.  I will not go through each track for if you have read my previous reviews of music, you know that music is meant to be listened to and experienced, and it is a universal language without words.  Words cannot really do justice to music, and trying to tell you how music sounds it like trying to describe honey to someone that has never tasted honey before.  How would you describe it?  That being said, I love each one of these tracks.  Let your imagination out of the cage, and get prepared to be moved to new emotional heights, new worlds, and endless possibilities for images and feelings to come to your mind.  What comes to your mind will be different than what comes to my mind, and on repeated hearings of this music, it can change.  For example, the first time I heard Track 2, I pictured an alien spaceship descending on a planet and a battle ensuing to repel them.  However, on the second hearing, it brought to my mind, helicopters bringing in military troops, and men trying to take back a stretch of beach from the enemy.  There are a couple of places that you can hear a trumpet playing for those who have lost their lives.  Some of my favorite Tracks are:  I love Track 5, Eternal Light, with that soaring theme that takes you for a ride in the clouds; Track 6, for this really, neat funky beat that makes you feel like driving a car real fast (don't listen to this one in your car); Track 14, for that great pulsing beat and theme that gives you determination to keep going forward, pushing towards your goals, and lastly, Track 19, Metamorphosis, for that hauntingly beautiful piano, electronic sounds, and powerful drums that makes your feel like piloting your spacecraft to another planet.  Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":1}

Or even Hubble without his telescope.\n\nNow, imagine Mumford & Sons sans banjos.\n\nOkay, now that's being a bit dramatic, but we've come to identify with this band based on their unique use of instruments and their passion, both of which are almost completely absent from this album.\n\nNow, this isn't a bad album by any means. Anyone giving it a 1-star review is likely acting based on some knee-jerk reaction. \"OMG, they changed their sound. Sellouts! I hate them!\"\n\nNo, that's not what happened here. You can't fault the band for pursuing a new sound. What band has remained the same throughout their entire career? Mumford & Sons needed to try something new. The problem here is that their \"new\" is the same old thing that tons of bands have been doing for years. This is a generic pop\/rock album. It's like they've taken a Coldplay formula but stripped out everything that's unique.\n\nThere are enjoyable songs on here. Actually, there's not really a bad track. But nothing stands out as memorable either. It's just another album that will be filed away as utterly forgettable. Had this been Mumford & Sons first album, no one would have even cared about it.\n\nThis album deserves three stars because it is about as mediocre and middle-of-the-road as music can be.

{"text":"This collection represents the Bach Guilds third Baroque Box collection, and believe it or not (in response to a few early posters in this space), there is still plenty more to bring out.\n\nThis box doesnt have the splashy, just discovered in the vaults releases that weve sprinkled throughout our previous releases. However, it does have plenty of rewards for the faithful followers of the Big Baroque Box series.\n\nWeve taken a trip down the historically informed performance practice side of the Bach Guilds history in previous releases, but for BB3 were offering up another way of looking at the baroque. Most of the recordings here were debut recordings in their day  of course, that day might have been 60 years ago (20,000 days?), but the always intrepid Solomon brothers found supporters of baroque music in unusual places  Copenhagen, Hartford, Washington, DC  and while the historical informed champions like Gustav Leonhardt and Nikolaus Harnoncourt ultimately won the day, the baroque catalog of The Bach Guild does show that not all baroque and early music experiences have to be performed with small ensembles on gut strings.\n\nSo we have baroque music interpreted in many ways in Big Baroque 3  from the unexpected champion Leopold Stokowski revving up Vivaldi and Bach, Mischa Elmans journeys through Tartini, Vivaldi and Bach to full orchestral performances of orchestral suites of Rameau, Gretry and Purcell.\n\nThe orchestral material on this set is all full orchestras and no early music ensembles. Well be featuring the Concentus Musicus Wien soon in their own box, and that will bring plenty of original instrument sounds to a listeners hard drive or cloud account. So sit back and luxuriate in pillowy strings and lush crescendos where you might not be used to hearing such musical events.\nIts not all Wagnerian baroque  the exceptional Anton Heiller is often featured in our releases, and we present two of his harpsichord recitals here, featuring works by Couperin and Soler.\n\nFrom the far reaches of the vault comes the nearly completely forgotten recording from 1952, Bach Guild catalog number 566 (the numbering system started at 501 so this is obviously very early), Italian Baroque Music featuring Danish musicians and undeniably receiving their first hearing in nearly 60 years. From almost the same time frame comes a recording titled Birth of the Baroque, BG 591, from Consort of Viols of the Pro Arte Antiqua of Prague. Both of these recordings were included for their hard-to-find repertoire, but also to indicate the pioneering spirit of the early 1950s  these small baroque ensembles were somehow discovered and released to help fill the pipeline for the growing interest in baroque in the United States academic community and ultimately the larger public. They make their reappearance after a half a century of dormancy.\n\nAs a final treat, weve revived a wonderful vocal performance from the 1990s, originally released on Omega Classics. Pergolesis La Serva Padrona was originally interspersed on its original CD release with some Vivaldi concertos. Weve already released the Vivaldi concertos elsewhere, but weve including this recording with its fine cast of New York based performers, which has been out of print for almost 20 years.","classification":5,"fold":1}

In particular, the number with Naya Rivera, Supermassive Black Hole kind of gets on my nerves.  I think she is talented but there is something definitely missing if you are only listening and not watching.  There are a couple of songs I really love.  Hearing The Book of Love inspired me to get out my Shall We Dance DVD last night.  I really like that song a lot, and I love me some Zucchero.  It's touching and a bit hokey at the same time.  I also thought Lang Lang's piano added elegance and beauty to Clocks.\n\nThe two guys seem like a lot of fun.  I think they are going to bring us a lot of clever takes on rock songs in the future.

Like many others, I remember seeing the music video to this song when I was a teenager. I honestly found the music video very eccentric (in a positive way), but creative at the same time, and hearing the song got me interested in hearing it more.  I admit that this review is also influenced by the fact that I think that he is very hot in the video. The song contains many good industrial rock notes in it, and I like the words to the chorus when he nearly seductively whispers towards the middle of the song (there is a cool chorus part where he says the following lyrics that I find very sexy and creative:( Through every forest, above the trees Within my stomach, scraped off my knees I drink the honey inside your hive You are the reason I stay alive). Obviously, many who read this review already know exactly what that part of the chorus means. I was only listing one part of the various great parts of the song that I found very exciting.

{"text":"Sarah Jarosz is a class act.  She's a fine musician, an excellent songwriter and a very good singer, all of which are in evidence here.\n\nI thought her last album, Build Me Up From Bones was one of the best of 2013.  Undercurrent (quite an apt title, I think) is rather different in character  quieter and more contemplative overall, with several tracks featuring Sarah Jarosz playing and singing solo.  It takes a bit of getting into, I found, because it doesnt always have the immediacy of, say, Over The Edge or Gone Too Soon, but after half-a-dozen listens, I'm hooked.  These songs are beautifully crafted musically, and often have very good lyrics.  They are personal and varied, with tender celebrations of love, harsh break-up songs (the excellent House Of Mercy) and yearning hints at reconciliation in the lovely, haunting Lost Dog.  There are some excellent collaborations, including with Aiofe O'Donovan on Still Life (returning Sarah's appearance on Aiofe's fine album Magic Hour). Production is restrained but spot on for these songs, I think, allowing each one to speak as it should and the more I listen to this album, the better I like it.\n\nI saw Sarah Jarosz live at London's Bush Hall a couple of years ago.  She was brilliant, performing superbly, making it look effortless and plainly putting everything into the music.  You can't fake that sort of quality, and Undercurrent is a worthy next step.  It's an album of real quality and it's a great listen.  Very warmly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":1}

I was definitely not thrilled with the material so far she has laid out for the Artpop record. Her collaboration with R. Kelly on Do What U Want was really a weak and not strong spot in her works. So is the lead single from the album Applause. It definitely was one song that felt like a boom at first with so many of Gag's little monsters, but instead made itself become a bust in voice. The song doesn't ignite in the way Love Game and Born This Way did. Overall, I really didn't feel Lady Gaga gave it her all enough to make even more applause than she already has in her music. Is it worth checking out and downloading? Maybe, if there was more applause to it.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":1}

{"text":"The two sisters Emily and Martie has used the break, Dixie Chicks apparently have chosen to observe, to record and release an album as \"Court Yard Hounds\". The songs are generally good, but only in some cases really great. The edge that despite everything characterize Dixie Chicks, is somewhat missing and the album appears a little too neat.\n\nEmily Robinson has written most songs, several together with Martin Strayer, and one song with sister Martie. Emily sings even lead-vocals on the songs, and it is amazing how much her voice and phrasing recalls Sheryl Crow. Some of the songs actually sound like Sheryl Crow songs, which is not so bad. Lyrically the songs seem very personal and honest.\n\nAs mentioned, the songs are generally good, and of course, some of them stand out from the rest. \"The Coast\" is an up-beat country pop song; commercial in the good way and a spreader of good humor.\n\n\"See You in Spring\" is a nice ballad, performed as a duet between Jakob Dylan, and Emily Also the two quiet acoustic ballads \"Fairytale\" and \"Fear of Wasted Time\" stand out. My personal favorite, though, is Martie Maguire's \"Gracefully\", Which I find in the same league as \"You Were Mine\" from the \"Wide Open Spaces\" album. A very moving song.\n\nNo matter what, it's a great to have this album while waiting for Natalie Maines to join the sisters again.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Say what you will about Lil' Wayne, but 2008's THA CARTER III is probably the best Rap album of 2008. In a year where sales have been incredibly sub-par, the fact that THA CARTER III sold 1 million copies it's first week says something. Not only has Wayne sold 1.5 million (in 3 weeks), but he has the quality within this album to backup the sales.  There are few fillers on this album, which makes it all the more consistent.\n\nThe production work is on point throughout the affair, with the bare-bones, \"skeletal\" production of my personal favorite track, \"A Milli\" being exceptional.  Jim Jonsin's production work on ubiquitous, catchy first single \"Lollipop\" featuring Static Major is also great. \"A Milli\" just may be Wayne's best song in which he boasts such cool lines as \"motherf****** I'm ill\", \"...I'm ill, not sick... my watch sick, my glock's sick...\" Production itself aside, these two tracks are the \"cream of the crop\" of THA CARTER III, though there are many others nearly\/equally as good.  \"3 Peat\" is a fine opening track, making the listener aware that Wayne is on fire on this third volume of his THA CARTER.  \"Mr. Carter\" featuring none other than the other Mr. Carter, Jay-Z is also top-notch. Moreso than his fine THA CARTER II, this album is more \"friendly\" to the listener, which many will debate is Wayne selling out, though I think it's the evolution of Weezy personally.\n\nAfter the brilliant \"A Milli\", T-Pain joins for the fine \"Got Money\", though it is only a bridesmaid after the killer \"A Milli\". Wayne softens around the edges for \"Comfortable\", which features Babyface in top form.  The Kanye West helmed number borrows the lush strings from Alicia Keys's \"You Don't Know My Name\" (I believe) and adds a sick drums and an \"ill\" bass line. Follow-up \"Dr. Carter\" features a toned-down Swizz Beatz, though it doesn't sound or feel toned down by any means. This along with the 'ill' \"Phone Home\" are among the most creative numbers I've heard in hip-hop in some time. The show stealer is definitely the Robin Thicke featured\/helmed \"Tie My Hands\" in which Thicke sings so sincerely \"if you tie my hands, what am I gonna do...\".  Here, Weezy references Hurricane Katrina in one of the most sincere rap songs particularly for Wayne.\n\nWhile nothing else shines quite as brightly as the above-mentioned, \"Let The Beat Build\" is fine, as is the David Banner produced \"La La\", showcasing Banner's knack for hip-hop joints.  Overall, THA CARTER III isn't perfect, but it is pretty darn good. 4  stars.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"What happens when one of the greatest composers of R&B\/Funk discovers a woman who would go on to become one of the greatest singers of R&B\/Funk is Tell Me Something Good. Stevie Wonder was deep into his Funk classics like You Haven't Done Nothin' and Boogie On Reggae Woman when he first heard Chaka Khan & Rufus and the word is, virtually on-the-spot, wrote Tell Me Something Good for her. It's one of his best songs, one of her best songs and one of the best early 70's songs, period.\n\nIt's stripped down, too, right to the essentials. It doesn't have the multiple rhythms of a typical Wonder song of the time, it doesn't have the elaborate vocals of Earth, wind & Fire or Kool & the Gang, or the smooth horn section of the Ohio Players. But it doesn't need all that because it has Chaka Khan singing her heart out. This song tore up the airwaves in 1974 and is just as good today.","classification":5,"fold":1}

The Highlights for me are \"Too Early\", \"Equestrian\", \"IV Play\" And \"Holy Love\" The rest of the songs are kind of irrelevant.

{"text":"It's hard to believe two of these musicians were a year away from recording one of rock's most frightening songs, \"21st Century Schizoid Man.\" when you listen to this Giles Giles & Fripp album.\n\nIf you can think of a rock\/jazz barbershop trio, that is what this music sounds like. Listen to the intro of \"She Is Loaded,\" a very funny piece about staying with a fat chick for the money. The vocals reach back to 1940's and 50's pre-rock vocal groups.\n\nWhich does not mean this music is not complex and interesting: both Mike Giles syncopated drumming and brother Pete's syncopated--almost funky-- bass give edge to this chipper songs.\n\nSurprisingly, Fripp sounds the most traditional, not the player he soon became: none of his sustained notes are here. He sounds more like Grant Green than a man about to terrorize the Marquee Club with a few sustained notes and death rattle schizoid feedback.\n\nThere are tracks that would become Crimson songs: \"I Talk To The Wind,\" and \"Drop In,\" but their treatment here makes them unrecognizable.\n\nWhen Ian McDonald and Mike Giles left King Crimson at the end of 1969, McDonald said \"It's not happy music.\" This album is--a great take on pre-rock forms.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"I love Ryan Adams.  Against my better judgement, I have come to also love Taylor Swift--and at her best, I think she is a very fine song writer.  I also really love it when talented people cover really good songs in an original manner.  When I heard that Ryan was covering 1989 as if he were covering Nebraska by Springsteen, I knew I wanted a listen.  Damn if he didn't knock it out of the park.  He is in awesome voice, and his instrumentation is neither spare nor overbearing....it really is like he treated all of these songs like his own children,  this album can easily stand up to anything that Ryan has done on his own (and that says a lot) and is a viable alternative to Tay's own outstanding effort.  His version of Blank space is naked, painful, a paean to loneliness.  Style becomes a funky, punky strut.  Shake it off starts with a greasy organ and a rim shot and soon becomes a romp through a haunting nightmare of misunderstanding and isolation.  Amazing.  When the pedal steel kicks in...I got chills.  Listen, if you love Tay and are not scared to see how her songs stand up to reinterpretation, you will love this with good reason.  If you love Ryan, yiu will go nuts for this bad boy, heart on the sleeve love letter to some great songwriting.  Nonstop awesome.  Check it out, give it to your friends.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I know, \"HERESY!\" Only three stars for one of the great live bands playing today. Well, that's how I hear it. There is little new or unexpected from this group. I also am a bit confused as to why the band or whomever is responsible for marketing thought this was worthy of two discs and a special box container. It reminds me of when Jeff Beck released \"Beckology\" and it came in a suitcase... At least that had a great booklet with it.\nMake no mistake, this is a fine album, but it's just a bit, well, lackluster. I don't find that the second disc serves any purpose beyond jacking up the price. There is really nothing of great interest among the live tracks or the alternate versions of songs on the main disc.\nWhat I came away with is the sense that this band is holding Susan Tedeschi back. She has become a monster guitar player in her own right. If you can, catch the video of them playing at Red Rocks. It ends with Susan playing an in-your-face, throw down, top this, guitar solo. I later learned they were opening for B.B. King! Susan has had her own band. I have seen both the TTB and Susan with her own band. They were both great!\nBut this album, with the fitting title, \"Let Me Get By\", shows that the band can play and, perhaps, just needed to release something to keep their fan-base happy. Yes, it \"let's them get by.\" Nonetheless I came away wanting more, more from Susan Tedeschi. Derek, (her husband, I know) can still play masterful slide as well, if not better, than his uncle's former band mates, Duane Allman and Dickie Betts.\nAnother thing I found a bit questionable was how much some tracks, including the opening track, sound a bit like, well, the Allman Brothers circa Fillmore East and Eat a Peach.\nI'm not saying don't buy the album, and maybe my review is tainted by my nearly 66 years, all but 8 of them spent listening to and playing music. Like I said, almost sounding like the cop on South Park, \"move along, nothing to see here...\" if you love the band, I know you must have this release, but I hope this is just the TTB \"getting by\" and not a sign that they have peaked and are now on cruise control.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Fifteen years is a long time between albums, but the Bangles have successfully managed to avoid sounding either like ripoffs of themselves or like something totally alien. They are truly back in form, with the slickness factor turned way down from Everything (though this is by no means All Over The Place, Volume 2).\nI am most impressed by the Peterson sisters' work on this album. I like Michael's \"Nickel Romeo,\" but her other songs here don't make much of an impression on me. Susanna sounds great as ever, but seems to be content mostly sticking to ballads (\"Something That You Said\", \"I Will Take Care of You\", \"Grateful\"). Not that these aren't great tracks, but she sounded great on the uptempo numbers from the early days. But Debbi turns in some of her best Bangles performances, period, on \"Ask Me No Questions\" and \"Here Right Now,\" and Vicki sounds great on \"Single by Choice,\" which I take not to be a defiant song of independence but something more akin to Simon & Garfunkel's \"I Am A Rock.\" And am I the only one who thinks she sounds like Shania Twain on \"Mixed Messages\"? As for \"The Rain Song,\" great stuff--but I have to say I liked the Continental Drifters' arrangement better. If only Vicki had been given the lead instead of Susan!\nThe ensemble vocals on \"Ride the Ride\" and \"Stealing Rosemary\" sound superb as well, and the instrumental playing is top-notch throughout. Vicki's mandolin is a nice touch.\nMy only criticism of this album is that it's a bit long. Not all of these songs are essential--I might have shortened Doll Revolution by dropping \"Lost at Sea,\" \"Song for a Good Son,\" and \"Between the Two.\"\nI understand some of these songs have been floating around for years--indeed, some have been recorded and released before--so it will be interesting to see if the fifth album, if there is one, can measure up to Doll Revolution. But even if it doesn't--who ever thought there would be a fourth?","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Cyndi Lauper is one of those eighties singers whose talent was modest but personality was overwhelming. It was what made \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/She-s-So-Unusual\/dp\/B000051Y0G\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">She's So Unusual<\/a>\" so brilliant; Cyndi was so totally outside the mold that everything on it quaked with the stellar portrayal of the artist as a young woman. From the classic anthem \"Girls Just Wanna have Fun\" to the emotional bulls-eye of \"Time After Time,\" Cyndi and all her friends established the pattern that would follow for the rest of her career. Cyndi found songs to match her one-of-a-kind voice and would deliver them with style.\n\nThat she had a knack for plucking gems from obscurity also helped. The Brains' apocryphal \"Money Changes Everything\" is one such example, ditto for \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/True-Colors\/dp\/B00000266K\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">True Colors<\/a>'s\" rocking \"Change of Heart.\" She was such a colorful fusion of styles and personality that the singles on this \"Essential\" collection still often sound buoyant and alive even now. It was around the time of \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/A-Night-to-Remember\/dp\/B0000026KU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">A Night to Remember<\/a>\" and \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Hatful-Of-Stars\/dp\/B00005G3WY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hatful Of Stars<\/a>\" that Cyndi's efforts to sound serious got the better of her. On \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Twelve-Deadly-Cyns-and-Then-Some\/dp\/B000002AM9\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Twelve Deadly Cyns and Then Some<\/a>,\" Cyndi wisely chose to include \"Sally's Pigeons\" (co-written with Mary Chapin Carpenter, of all people), where the emotional heft matched the ambition, where the title track here didn't.\n\nThat ambition also lead to Cyndi's activism. \"True Colors\" has become something of a gay anthem, a call to recognize yourself as the person you are. It became the Nom De'Tour of Cyndi's summer 2007 tour for the Human Rights Campaign (along with Debbie Harry and Erasure, among others), and her tireless work on behalf of the Matthew Sheppard Foundation and other causes. Her timeless music couples with her work for the future.\n\nHer attempt to broaden the style works OK on \"Sisters of Avalon\" and \"Unhook The Stars,\" but I would have happily traded them (or \"When You Were Mine\") in for \"What's Going On.\" All is forgiven however, by finally finding \"The Goonies R Good Enough\" on a proper US Cyndi Lauper CD. A quickie knock-off to a Steven Spielberg screaming kids movie, it is all the things great about Cyndi's hits; melodic, energetic and sing-along-quirky. It makes \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Essential-Cyndi-Lauper\/dp\/B00008PX8X\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Essential Cyndi Lauper<\/a>\" the best single disc collection of Cyndi you can get without shelling out for pricey double-disc imports.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"I was so thrilled when their reunion album finally happened.  I did not, however, expect it to exceed classics such as All Over The Place and Different Light, and it doesn't, but the songs are as fresh as if hearing them for the first time ever.  After fifteen years... Wow!  Getting this prevented me from tearing off my own head, to paraphrase the leading song. Key=[lead vocalist]\nAfter the phrase, \"One must tear off one's own head,\" comes a quick burst of snarling punkish guitar and Susanna's familiar sugary voice.  I haven't heard the original Elvis Costello version, but they really jam on \"Tear Off Your Own Head (Doll Revolution)\"  This opening number makes this yet another classic in the Bangles pantheon of hits.\n\"Stealing Rosemary\" is a simple song of a woman doing the title action for her man.  What, without parsley, sage, and thyme?  Kidding.  [Debbi]\n\"Something That You Said\" is another classic, with the solid Beatles\/Byrds influence heard with the guitar and the harmony vocals.  The drum machine in the background paints a modern addition.  And Susanna's voice never sounded so good!\n\"Ask Me No Questions\" has rhythmic overtones of the Beatles \"Rain\" without the feedback guitar.  The main chorus goes \"Oh, I'm in love with you\/But I turn away when you look in my eyes\/Ask me no questions I'll tell you no lies.\" [Debbi]\n\"Rain Song\" sung by Vicki is an upbeat guitar-oriented number where when it rains, she remembers her ex.  And there's a bitter taste with this line:  \"I'm doing fine as long as you stay locked up\/Inside a cloud of grey\"  Whoa! [Vicki]\nThat's quite a fancy dresser in \"Nickel Romeo\", someone who's described as \"a Cheshire cat in yellow Beatle boots\".  \"Strange desperation-you gotta cop that fix\/Making every little girl is keeping you alive.\"  That bad, huh?  [Michael]\n\"Ride The Ride\" has a similar beat but less ferocious than \"Doll Revolution\".  With signature guitar hooks, call it a close cousin to \"In Your Room\" [all]\nJust what I needed, another tender ballad to melt my heart, and my favourite song here.  \"I Will Take Care Of You\" is an affirmative song of support from a loved one who will stand tall alongside through times of fear and sadness:  \"Smile, if you can now\/Smile through your tears\/Here where your fears are known\/\nKnow you're safe at home.\"  Magic! [Susanna, of course!]\nGuitar and soundwise, the upbeat \"Here Right Now\" sounds like Green-era R.E.M. and calls for one to slow down.  \"Stand back and take a look around you\/Running from the pressures of a restless world\/Hush for a moment, baby, just be still\/Here now.\/Spend a minute next to me.\"  Amen to that!\nThe woman in bittersweet \"Single By Choice\" is affirmative of the title, adding \"Never marry, never ever divorce\/Listen to the solitary voice.\"  Even though she gives bad experiences she had, sad, isn't it? [Vicki]\n\"Lost At Sea\" details a couple who's lost so far in arguments that it's as if they are lost at sea.  The solution:  \"Take my hand, come to me\/Save a life, rescue you, rescue me.\"  Another Byrdsy song replete with harmonies. [Vicki]\n\"Song For A Good Son\" details a woman explaining to her son why she seems emotionally cold.  She is scarred by the loss of her mother, taken by the ocean current.  There are suicidal overtones:  \"Waterside so deep and wide\/If I follow, maybe I will find her.\" [Michael]\n\"Grateful\" is a lullaby to one's young son, enhanced by chorus harmonies of \"All we are and all we need is\" while Susanna's whispery sweet voice does lead.\nThe bonus DVD contains \"A Day In The Life Of The Bangles\" mini-documentary, which basically explains how they felt about getting back together, story behind \"TOYOH\", and their amazement at the large fan base they had, the \"Something That You Said\" video, audio and lyrics pages.\nAll the familiar elements are there, Susanna's sweet voice, the tight harmonies, the 60's rock influenced sound, the brand of garage pop\/rock hybrid.  It's as if they never broke up.  A warm welcome back!","classification":5,"fold":1}

There's verve, swagger, charm, energy, and conviction oozing through each song. It's almost hard to believe the single \"Exes and Ohs\" has broken through to the mainstream since it actually has balls. I'm high on this debut from Elle King, partly because it feels like she's achieved what the Pretty Reckless attempted with their last album, the fusion of blues, rock, and country with a soul filled voice. But also because there's a rare combination of raw and polished vocals that perfectly encapsulate the style of Elle. Take away the pretentious analysis...this is a really good album.

{"text":"A member of one of the most famous families from Bohemia, Franz Benda (1709-1789) entered into the service of Frederick the Great in 1732. As a violin master, he played some 50,000 performances over a forty year period. He also wrote a lot of violin music, 110 solo capriccios, at least 150 sonatas, 31 duets and some 28 concertos, including this one in D Major.\n\nWith a crisply articulated intro, the Allegro ma non molto features a harpsichord continuo and string dominated orchestral support. As a transitional work from the Baroque, it contains more interplay between the single violin and the symphonic tutti than was the norm for the prevalent Italian style. Smoothly flowing, Bendas writing for the solo string is virtuosic without being showy, letting the melodic lines develop naturally. In the minor keyed Largo, the sweep of the orchestral accompaniment lends a somber weight to the throbbing vibrato of Gabriela Demeterova. With a dramatic pathos in the uppermost register, she brings a sorrowful sweetness in her tone that must be similar to the reported quality that set apart Bendas adagio playing. Horns appear for the brisk finale, a bright Allegro with bravura fiddling as the single violin drifts high on the E string.\n\nA generation or two later, Bohemian born Vaclav Pichl (1741-1805) studied philosophy and theology in Prague before accepting a musical directorship in Milan. After 21 years, he returned to Vienna and died while playing a violin concerto at the Lobkowitz Palace.\nHis D Major Concerto Op. 3, No. 1 opens with a marching Allegro sostenuto, clipped and precise. While still employing the harpsichord as continuo, the writing finds even greater collaboration between the soloist and orchestra, engaging in extensive rhythmic interactions and trading melodic ideas, including one haunting echo in minor. A higher degree of technical proficiency of the single violin is also required.\n\nA minor keyed charmer, the following Adagio finds striking support in the lower strings with a lovely countermelody while the ethereal vibrato of the solo sounds so much like the beating of angel wings. Ending the 2nd movement on an open cadence sets up a smooth transition as the resolution occurs in the sweetly pure tones from the violin, the very first notes of the concluding Rondo. Interrupting the relentless drive in the lower strings, a brief passage in minor offers a dark interlude in an otherwise cheery finale.\n\nBy another Bohemian, the final concerto represents the culmination of the Viennese High Classical style. Renowned as a teacher and violin virtuoso, Antonin Vranicky (1761-1820) composed some outstanding chamber music and challenging concertos, one of which is the C Major included on this recording.\n\nUsing tympani and winds to create a broader palette of orchestral colors, the work begins with a bold Allegro giusto. Amid a longer, more extensive development section, the soloist shines in the fiendishly difficult passage work while in the reverential Adagio that follows, the writing stretches the upper reaches of the instruments register. After a chorale like start, the weeping violin carries the movement until gentle horns lead to a serene close. Marked Alla Pollacca- Allegretto, the finale is a frisky Polish folk dance. With an appealing stutter step in the rhythm, this 3rd movement features a brief mournful interlude, dazzling flourishes from the violin and a rousing finish.\n\nThe original recording from 1995 from Supraphon is fine, placing the solo violin close enough for the intimate slower sections to be sharp and clear. Under the able artistic direction of Milan Lajcik, the Prague Chamber Orchestra brings an accomplished reading to their fellow countrymens concertos. But the spotlight rightfully belongs to the exquisite work of Gabriela Demeterova. This fine traversal of the development of the Viennese violin concerto is testimony to her artistry.","classification":5,"fold":1}

Unfortunately one of those 90's souls, Scott Weiland from Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver died early at the age of 48. He has had so many great songs on his own, as a part of Velvet Revolver with Slash of Guns N' Roses, but especially when he was with S.T.P. The songs he had back in the 90's were the catalyst of his life. Sadly though, he died of those drug and alcohol problems, and his time in prison. Interstate Love Song, one his biggest songs from the S.T.P. album Purple is one of those songs that really brought out the best in his voice, and his spirit. He definitely drove from top to bottom in the song. It was really his best song, and the groups' biggest hit. I think of when he was gifted with a brilliant and gritty voice.

{"text":"George Szell (1897-1970) was able to perform a miraculous feat when he took the Cleveland Orchestra, a ho-hum, midwestern ensemble, and transform it into a finely tuned, razor sharp symphonic machine. Music of Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Strauss, Dvorak, Schumann and the like had rarely sounded so precise coming out of Ohio, let alone Vienna, Berlin, New York, etc. Szell had a total exactitude about his conducting style, once saying he could not pour chocolate sauce over asparagus, (when it came to sensuous tone and lush sonic beauty.) But his recordings still tend to be near the top of the cream of the crop, that is in the music he was best at. And Brahms was near the pinnacle for George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra. Case in point, this cd of The fourth symphony, with both overtures.\n  I have rarely heard a better Brahms 4th than this Szell recording. It's one of the two or three best Brahms 4th's I've ever heard. The only that top it are Karajan's 1977 BPO recording on DG, and Bruno Walter's luminous version from almost 60 years ago. Szell has better sound than Walter, but not as good sound as Karajan. However, Szell has no need to slather on the lush gloss (chocolate sauce) that Karajan lived for. No version of Brahms' 4th is as precise as this one. The whole work proceeds from beginning to end in the most logical of manners. Everything seems natural and unforced, so that the scope of the work is perfect. The drama of the first movement is captured in just the right way. The scherzo is bursting at all the right points. And the passacaglia finale is done wonderfully, with each variation succinct and unique, yet bound together by the perfectness of the 8 note theme. That George Szell\/Cleveland Orchestra precision is on display here in full measure like almost never before. Absolutely wonderful.\n  As for the Academic Festival and Tragic overtures, they are also done to a T. I've never had much great affection for these overtures though, seeing them as lightweight throwaways in the Brahms canon. (Any Brahms work that features the cymbals can't be taken TOO seriously.) But nonetheless they are popular, and they're a nice filler.\n  Since this disc is very cheap on Amazon.com, it is a great pick-up for the Brahms nut, the orchestral lover, or just somebody who likes stuff done with the precision it deserves. Recommended.-----------------------PEACE\nBTW---This cd is also included in a clamshell-style box set with all the symphonies, the Haydn variations, and more. That set's price does fluctuate a bit, so keep an eye on it.","classification":4,"fold":1}

On the other hand, Dance the Night Away isn't and also deserves (but doesn't get) a spot. Doing That Scrapyard Thing and What a Bringdown are simply throwaways. In their place, imagine Outside Woman Blues and the studio version of Spoonful.\n\nThen, look at disc two. Though it's true that Spoonful is awesome live, the studio version is much better. Toad, on the other hand, simply drags... unlike it's studio counterpart, which is amazing. And N.S.U. is just plain endless.\n\nStill, it does cover the basics - I Feel Free, N.S.U., Sweet Wine, Sunshine of Your Love, Tales of Brave Ulyssess, SWLABR, White Room, Politician, Crossroads, Anyone for Tennis and Badge, to be exact.

{"text":"It is so sad that of today's divas, they sincerely do not have voices anymore that spoke from the soul of the voice within. Yet, when I do think of today's divas in R&B, Beyonce' and Rihanna, etc. they sincerely do not have voices that speak from the soul anymore. They will never be soulful and beautiful as was the great Whitney Houston. If there is one thing that I have adored about Whitney is that she always sang from the soul brilliantly. But not only do I think of Whitney alone, I also do think if her one and only baby, Bobbi Kristina Brown, whom tragically died in 2015 from abuse from drugs and severe depression dealing with Whitney's death three years earlier. But when I do think of Whitney and Bobbi together as mother and daughter, I do think of so many of Whitney Houston's songs, and with the anniversary of Bobbi Kristina's passing, I do think of the two of them in song, and the song where Bobbi Kristina go her short start is My Love Is Your Love. The song is definitely soulful and very upbeat from the heart today, as it was back then in 1998 when it came out. Wyclef Jean wrote a very lovely song for Whitney Houston and it still is one of those songs that I love listening to.

Compared to Henley's previous work, it's a huge departure, so if you want \"All She Wants To Do Is Dance\" or something like that, you won't find it here. This is a country record and a damned good one. It's hard for me to state a favorite, because they're all good, and most of them are great. The supporting cast is a country all-star band, with Alison Krauss, Vince Gill, Dolly Parton, Martina McBride, Miranda Lambert and Merle Haggard all aboard. Even Mick Jagger (?) makes a noteable appearance. If you like the early Eagles sound, you'll feel right at home here. Don has aged gracefully and tackles the topic on a number of these tracks.

{"text":"This CD is a throwback to my youth.  I was about twelve years old when it came out--back when Boyz 2 Men was truly  a hot commodity.  They have a wonderful \"old school\" flavor reminiscent of the old doowop guy groups of 1960s.  This is especially evident in the four part harmonies, the smooth and romantic lyrics and the original interpretations of old standards (\"Yesterday\").\n\nWhere do I begin to describe the mood of this wonderful and innovative R&B album?  There is something for everyone on this CD.  We have the funky, catchy \"Thank You\" that samples from \"La-Di-Da-Di\" performed by Doug E. Fresh.  The hook is infectious!  We have \"All Around the World\" to get you up and dancing, no doubt.  One of my personal favorites is \"I Sit Away,\" written by Tony Rich (of the Tony Rich Project fame).  It has a haunting hook and a beautiful, introspective feel.  Truly an ode to solitude.  There are also a couple of songs on this album that became huge hits for the fellas back in the early 1990s.  They include \"I'll Make Love to You\" (on those songs to get you in the mood), and \"Water Runs Dry.\"\n\nOne of the strongest points of this album is the luscious arrangements and fine tuning of production on each of the cuts.  Even my least favorite of the songs--\"50 Candles\"--has a very sexy, clean and catchy arrangment.\n\nCheck this out!  And all of you young ones out there, don't write the Boyz as just another R&B band from the 1990s.  They were truly in a class by themselves.","classification":5,"fold":1}

Seven years is too long and hopefully, even with their other projects, they'll continue to record as a trio.\n\nThat said, I'm liking the disk. It's good.....but somehow it lacks a little.\n\nI mean, the trio's harmonies are incredibly strong still. Their musicianship is stellar. Sean Watkins guitar work on \"21st of May\" is outstanding. And it's a good tongue-in-cheek song as well.\n\nChris Thile , as always does a great job.  I love \"You Don't Know What's Going On\".  I'm not as wild for \"Rest of My Life\". Sara Watkins' violin sounds very Beatles 'White Album'-ish. It's different for sure, but out of place.\n\nAnd speaking of Sara Watkins, her selections are a mixed bag like Thile's.  \"Where is Love Now\" is fine, but a bit bland. I love love love \"Destination\".\n\nBut.....I love \"Destination\" more in any number of live versions you find on YouTube. How Nickel Creek actually performs some of these songs live are leaps and bounds better than the studio versions. \"Destination\" has the band really working together and the lead vocals are more free and nuanced. There is more life in them in this setting. I almost wish they recorded the songs on 'A Dotted Line\" this way.\n\nAs for people's take on \"Hayloft\", yes, it threw me as an inclusion. But the more I listen to it, I really like it. It's not really bluegrass, clearly, but with a good remix, someone should play it in a club. And this isn't really new for them, as the band does a great cover of Fleetwood Mac's \"the Ledge\" from their 'Tusk' album.\n\nThey're willing to take risks, which I like. It's easy to be play it safe when you haven't recorded for over half a decade. But I think that's why they got back together......to do something new.\n\n'A Dotted Line' is good.  And yes, it could be better......but still, when you have talent like this, I'm happy to see them any day of the week.","classification":4,"fold":1}

As Nancy advances toward her September years her voice has mellowed, gotten richer and even more beautiful. Her newer CD RSVP is another fine example of her later talent.  On this CD, the song \"Love I Found You\" is the stunner on this set.  As I stated all the songs are first rate and she handles them as the pro she is but \"Love I Foud You\" will live inside of you long after the CD has been switched off.

{"text":"I think it's difficult to expect a lot from a new Bangles cd.  Their last full one was 1989's 'Everything'.  In my opinion it is hard for them to ever top their debut album (not their EP).  You had to figure U.S. record companies must have had similar thoughts since this disk has been released everywhere else since early 2003.\nThey still have decent songwriting abilities and continue to have great blended harmonies (\"Stealing Rosemary\").  Both of these things are their saving grace.\nEach member has one very good song. Debbie Peterson has \"Here Right Now\", which should have been the initial single. Susanna Hoffs has \"Something That You Said\", which is the first single and would have been a great follow-up single selection. Vicki Peterson has \"Single By Choice\" and Michael Steele has \"Between the Two\".  There are others that are certainly ok, just nothing outstanding.  Even \"Ride the Ride\" isn't as good as the version I downloaded off the internet (oops) almost 2 years ago.\nOverall, Debbie Peterson and Michael Steele are the most consistent on this disk.  Steele has always been under-utilized as a lead vocalist and songwriter. Nothing changes here.  I'm really liking her  \"Song For a Good Son\".  She's at least got the most original material of the four - and always has. I always liked Vicki Peterson's stuff, but it's all just very bland on this disk (\"Ask Me No Questions\").  Susanna Hoffs is astonishingly the weakest during this set (except for the aforementioned 'Something That You Said\").  \"I Will Take Care of You\" is just downright lame.\nIn my opinion, the album closer, 'Grateful', is possibly the worst song the Bangles have ever done.  The chorus is one step away from a bad children's chorale.  And they did nothing special to cover the Elvis Costello title tune.\nSupposedly they are working towards a new release, since this has really been completed for a year.  Let's hope they get it together and deliver a stellar disk.","classification":3,"fold":1}

Certainly if you love the music from the late '60's you will both remember and enjoy this set.  The alternative tracks \/ demo's and live tracks are a nice addition.  Amazing music!","classification":5,"fold":1}
{"text":"Let me get this out of the way: I completely understand why so many fans are upset with this record. It's a massive departure from a sound that many fell in love with. It's interesting because I remember some complaints about Babel being too similar to Sigh No More and now we have complaints that Wilder Mind is too different. You can't please everyone but I give the band credit for going through with this, especially since they had to know that this would alienate a sizable portion of their base. This will be an acquired taste but it's one that, when taken for what it is, produces some pretty enjoyable results.\n\nThe LP opens on a high, with songs like \"Tompkins Square Park\" and lead single \"Believe\" expanding the band's sound with more prominent drums and keyboards. \"The Wolf\" is one of the biggest surprises on the record for its sheer noise and relentless drive, yet it feels natural and exciting. I always suspected that Mumford & Sons had more genres up their sleeves and here they have a bigger palate to play with. Other tracks like \"Hot Gates\" and \"Cold Arms\" are more subdued and offer a softer side to the building crescendos found throughout the rest of the album. There's a noticeable U2 and Coldplay influence on display here, although sprinkles of Springsteen and Radiohead are thrown in for good measure. The sound is somewhat generic and it's unfortunate that the band doesn't do more to break away from the standard formula. It's done quite well but aside from the overall stylistic shift there aren't too many actual surprises to be found. That can be a good or bad thing depending on what you're looking for. The beloved banjo is gone but personally I don't find it problematic.\n\nLyrics have been a highlight of the group and here they're serviceable but rarely as deep and poetic as they were before. The spiritual and literary themes are largely absent, replaced by familiar themes of crumbling relationships and love in uncertain times. There's nothing embarrassing on display but there are very few lines that are sticking with me. The production is solid and the interplay between instruments is nicely done. This may be a random complaint but the packaging for the CD edition is deplorable: no lyrics, no booklet, no pictures or CD tray, just a cheap digipack with slits on both sides to ensure the disc keeps sliding out and moving all over the place. Is it any wonder that people are abandoning physical media when they're not even rewarded with decent packaging for purchasing a physical disc?\n\nWilder Mind is a nice changeup and it's a record I'm enjoying quite a bit. Many of the complaints do have some validity and I can't help thinking that this would have been more widely embraced if these electronic elements had been introduced more subtly instead of sprung on us all at once. I love curveballs like this but it's easy to see why so many people are struggling with it. Artists like U2 and Radiohead can pull this off but I'm not sure Mumford and his bandmates are quite there yet, though this is a nice stepping stone to something fresh and I'm excited to see what they will tackle next.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Ann Sweeten returns refreshed and renewed with a collection of tranquil piano tunes that seek to move beyond the pressures of the past and look ahead to the future with determination.\n\nOnce again, Sweeten turns to producer Will Ackerman and his Imaginary Road Studios in Vermont to provide a crisp, state-of-the-art recording that brings out the nuanced subtleties of Sweeten's masterful keyboard skills. This gives the CD the sense of an up-close-and-personal performance at an intimate venue.\n\nSweeten is joined on this outing by Ackerman on guitar, Trisha Craig on flute, Akane Setiawan on English horn and oboe, Andrew Eng on viola and violin, and Liz Ehrman on cello. These musicians are as masterful in their restraint as they are in their technique, perfectly accentuating the piano-based focus of the music and providing just a hint of embellishment in keeping with the overall quietude of the album.\n\nAs usual, Sweeten's compositions are striking and beautiful, complemented by Sweeten's gorgeous performances. Some of her playing is simple and understated, and some of it is very complex and involved. But it is all effortlessly and expertly controlled, evidence of a true maestro at work. The result is a perfect mental getaway and a fine listening experience.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Jimmy Cliff provided some of the soundtrack of my youth, especially albums like the movie soundtrack \"The harder they Come\" and \"House Of Exile\". Listening to his new CD \"Rebirth\", it's almost like time never went by; same vintage Reggae sound and voice, with much of the lyrics addressing the state of the planet - crime, recession, poverty, etc.\n\nAnd this is a compliment. Produced by Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong, the album takes Cliff back to his roots and could almost be from some lost seventies sessions, similar to Rick Rubin's work with Johnny Cash. \"World Upside down\" takes a look at the state of the world today and is akin to his \"Wonderful World, Beautiful People\" from 1969. \"One More\" is groovy with darting horns (and appears again at the end in an alternate version), while the lilting \"Cry No More\" finds him singing the chorus in falsetto.  These set the tone for much of the album.\n\nEverything is great really, \"Outsider\" is a bouncy Blues\/Soul number peppered with hand-claps and horns, \"Ruby Soho\" is gentle and melodic, but the standout has got to be his terrific cover of The Clash's \"Guns Of Brixton\" with groovy bass and great horns. A real rebirth!","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"The program notes are gushing when they call Bruno Walter the most eminent interpreter of Brahms in the twentieth century, but here is a conductor, still capable of making this powerful Brahms First in 1959, who was twenty when the composer died. He learned his Brahms fro no less than Hans von Bulow and would have met the composer n person except that Brahms had entered his last year and was too ill to travel (Walter's mentor Gustav Mahler made the journey to Sichl, where the aged Brahms spent his summers, and found the old man melancholy and misanthropic - yet from a modern perspective, Brahms was hardly elderly at 64).\n\nThere's no need for me to heap my praise on so many others'.  I only want to recount my surprise, after an absence of ten years or so,  on returning to Walter's stereo Brahms First and finding it  so dynamic and alert. When it first came out, his Columbia Sym. cycle was considered less than the mono one he made in the early Fifties with the NY Phil. Waning energies were attributed to Walter's troubles with heart disease, but that first cycle comes in raw sound, even when remastered, and it has some rough edges, too. There's a driven quality that might be the influence of Toscanini; there was enormous pressure in America for every conductor to ape Toscanini or fall under his shadow.\n\nThe remake is more Viennese, always moving forward but with a core of relaxed enjoyment in music-making. In the second movement we realize that not being close to Toscanini doesn't mean you've drawn near to Furtwangler. Walter's style isn't philosophical or searching. He's just a master of the traditional Romantic style that nurtured him in the nineteenth century.  without being personal, he's authentic. The orchestra can be criticized for imbalances due to an under-powered string body, but in Brahms's day the strings were often even less.  the scoring sounds sweeter and mellower for being able to hear horn and oboe almost all the time rather than Karajan's wall-of-sound violins. Walter is also more modest and lyrical than either Furtwangler or Karajan. In short, a reading that can carry you through a lifetime. It has Walter's famous singing quality and strength of purpose, too.\n\nAfter recording the symphony in Nov. 1959, Walter returned the following January for the Haydn Variations and Academic Festival Over. (The latter at least used to be almost universally known to young listeners - but now?) Both are done with the same blend of mellowness and authority. For once, the overture actually feels festive with the extra snap Walter gives it.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I ordered this collection earlier in the year (I think that's when it was) because it had several songs that I didn't have and hadn't heard, in addition to several of my favorite ones. Well, turns out that it isn't that great after all. I may be in the minority, I don't know, but I'm rather disappointed with this \"essential\" collection.\nThe second CD suffers most. There are way too many songs on it that I really wouldn't have missed if they had been left off. These include most of the really long songs (\"Albuquerque,\" \"Trapped In The Drive-Thru\"), \"Hardware Store,\" \"Since You've Been Gone,\" \"Gump,\" and several others. There are better songs that could have been included instead. In fact, if you took off \"Albuquerque\" and \"Trapped In The Drive-Thru,\" you could replace each of them with two songs, at least.\nThe first CD (featuring material from his early-80s-to-early-90s period) is a lot better, but it also has its flaws. For example, I would have preferred \"Addicted To Spuds\" to \"Dog Eat Dog,\" and \"Biggest Ball Of Twine In Minnesota\" is good, but I wouldn't have complained if \"Christmas At Ground Zero\" and \"Achy Breaky Song\" had been on the CD instead. In fact, I don't really see how anyone could leave those two songs off of a Weird Al \"essential\" collection.\nIf it's true that Al himself compiled this collection, he could have done a lot better. Heck, anybody could have.\n I know that there are people who won't agree with my views here, and I have to admit that there is some good to be found on these CDs (most of it on the first), but overall, this \"essential\" collection leaves me kind of cold; it barely avoids getting just two stars from me.\n(By the way, is it just me, or does Al look even dorkier without the mustache and glasses than he did with them?)","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Ill never love a Darkness album as much as One Way Ticket so I won't be comparing this album to that. Permission to land is their other classic but its 12 years ago so thats not a fair comparison either  even though this album is the closest thing to PTL theyve done since.\n\nSo comparing Last Of Our Kind (LOOK) to the previous album, Hot Cakes seem appropriate. For all of the good tracks on Hot Cakes, it really only had one A grade track  Concrete. Some B pluses  Nothings Gonna Stop Us and Keep Me Hanging on. The rest were solid Bs with the one dud  She Just A Girl, Eddie.\n\nLast Of Our Kind is more solid and consistent, while still retaining a good variety of tunes. Its rockier in parts than theyve been in a while, some of it would class as hard rock. Theyve thrown in some fun, of course, but are a tad more serious than theyve been in the past. More mature as many have called it.\n\nAt first listen, I thought Oh Dear. There wasn't a lot to like on first run through but I had faith the songs would improve on me.\nBarbarians has been out for a long time now and its a fun, catchy and rocking song. Pure TD tongue in cheek and a great track.\nOpen Fire (the lead single) took me a while to get into and it doesnt rank high in my list of favourite TD songs. Its as un-TD as TD does. A good track but certainly not classic.\nLast Of Our Kind is one of the new tracks that stands out on first listen and only improves from there. Its hard not to get the chorus stuck in your head and after a couple of early run throughs of the album it was the track that stuck with me the most. It remains the stand out track.\nRoaring Waters is a good mid-tempo rocker. Is perhaps the track that sounds the most like something from Permission To Land. Again, very likeable, but no classic. Some interesting tempo changes at the end.\nWheels Of The Machine is a slower track. Kind of a Love Is Only A Feeling feel about it. Another nice track without hitting any great heights.\nMighty Wings had me thinking of a Cheap Trick cover perhaps but not to be. Its epic to say the least. The start had me thinking of Queens Flash Gordon soundtrack. Then you hit a Megadeth-like guitar intro and verse that progresses into a Def Leppard Adrenalize inspired over the top falsetto chorus. It perfectly fits the track 5-6 space that rock epics often occupy on an album.\nMudslide comes and goes pretty quickly. An OK track and though it brought a smile to my face on first listen, I could do without the Mrs Brown(s Boys) bookend speaking.\nSarah, OSarah has a Friday Night sound about it. The album needed a ballad like this and its something The Darkness do very well. A fun and catchy tune.\nHammer & Tongs is the third official pre-release track and perhaps the catchiest track here. A familiar opening riff and likeable chorus make for a solid track. Its perhaps a bit lightweight and hangs around too long.\nConquerors, lets face it, is a B Side  if B Sides existed any more. Its not album worthy and not how an album should be closed. Sure its an OK song but Justin should sing it. It wouldnt have made it onto any previous album.\n\nSo without comparing it to Permission To Land it seems that where the majority of individual track comparisons come from!!\n\nAll in all, some of the tracks don't hit the heights of those before them. There aren't too many stand out awesomely classic songs but as a complete album, it all works very well.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Back in 1985\/86, Slash Records seemed to be on the brink of starting a whole new American Breed of Rockers. They had new albums and new bands from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Los-Lobos\/dp\/B000CCD0F8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Los Lobos<\/a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Blasters\/dp\/B000VUTP4G\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Blasters<\/a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Bodeans\/dp\/B00005Y1Y4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Bodeans<\/a>. They all got sort of lumped into the 'new wave' category, but there was something more going on here. \"Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams\" was one of the best embodiments of this group of bands, and reissue, almost 25 years after the fact, shows why.\n\nThe Bodeans were young and enthusiastic kids who wanted to make their own sound. Being from Wisconsin, they has no burning desire to be trendy or fashionable, just to make music that felt like escape to them. With the first thrilling notes of \"She's A Runaway\" and the rocking theme of breakout the song offers, it's an instant classic that should have slotted in comfortably next to the Springsteen or Mellencamp hits of the day. T-Bone Burnette heard the truth inside the songs and the vocal magic Kurt Neumann and Sam Llanas made, and hauled them away to Los Angeles to make this album. \"Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams\" is a missing link of an album, the chain the runs between The Everly Brothers and The Rolling Stones (from whom the album nicked its title).\n\nThe remaster sounds incredible. The BoDeans were still fresh and excited, with T-Bone at the top of his early production game. \"Rickshaw Riding\" has sudden space in its slowbreathing sound. \"Looking for Me Somewhere\" sounds like Johnny Cash passed on it to hand it over to these youngsters. And the bonus track \"Turn Your Radio On\" makes you wonder why this Chuck Berry-ish rocker got left behind.\n\nThe there's the DVD, a homecoming of sorts with a live Minneapolis concert from 1985. Again, there's this brash enthusiasm that only a hungry young band could muster, and it's great fun to watch. It's east to see why (if you believe Kurt's liner notes) the T-Bone urged the suits at Warners to sing The Bodeans because \"they're gonna be bigger than The Beatles.\" It includes songs that never made it to the studio albums done in front of a hometown audience, excited that their local heroes just might be the next big thing. \"Love and Hope and Sex and Dreams\" captures that desire, and this re-issue - from the good folks at Rhino - makes you scratch your head as to why it didn't happen.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Nirvana destroyed kurt k's life is some ways , and in some ways it helped to make metal one of the most unpopular forms of music on the planet. The reason wasn't nirvana's fault , they just wanted to make their own kind of metal which was fine.  and this is a good type of metal, The disaster occured when this was put up as the ONLY good type of metal , noone could have withstood that tag. metal should have been seen as a varied thing, instead we got now it's grunge or nothing. which was the start of the fall of metal, previously metal was a openarmed affair with all sorts of it accepted as valid from melodic , to pop metal to thrash you name it.  then the pinheads touted this as the answer, not only as the answer to metal but also a social answer! (heroin ethos?)  and that was a death sentence for metal. I like this cd , it's good alt metal but it's no better than other types of metal and it wasn't the answer. In fact after this all other types of metal were squashed , grunge lasted a few years and then we were in a situation of now it must be very hard or thrashy or nothing, this effectively destroyed the wideopenness that metal had been, killed off the format to most of the world and then laid waste to listenership completely. bad radio stations like colorado spring's kilo helped this disaster and bear the blame as well. why?, that was the station that for a while set the standard. So this should have been seen as a decent metal cd of it's own brand and put up alongside the many other types of metal including what was popular at the time, instead it was the answer to the end of a genres popularity in the long run. Still metal fans should enjoy this one because it's a good metal cd. with decent to great alt metal songs and that's all it ever really was , and that's why k.c. labeled with a messiah tag was doomed as eventually metal itself was in some respects ,doomed to be a shell of itself with little variety and little melody or listeners.","classification":4,"fold":1}

Providing saccharine settings for the gurgling croak and the gravelly wheeze of a lifelong smoker pretty much defines the word \"ill-conceived.\" Since he's one of the greatest songwriters ever, and since he's donating his profits from this album to good causes, I may forgive Dylan someday, but first I'll have to somehow forget hearing Santa Claus dragged over the coals and the Little Drummer Boy strangled and the Herald Angels scream. Do you hear what I hear? Then plug your ears! What could they have been thinking when they recorded this disgraceful dreck?\n\nI'll give this much to the CD: it's given Amazon reviewers the opportunity to sharpen their wit and lavish the music with the caustic comments it deserves. Allow me to quote a few of them: \"He makes Tom Waits sound like Perry Como.\" \"It's enough to make the most devout Christian consider atheism. Giving this two stars. One for each of Bob's tar-filled lungs.\" \"If I were a little kid, I'd run and hide my head under the pillow rather than listen. Actually, I may do that myself.\" \"Perhaps a better name for the album would have been 'Your Crazy Uncle Gets Drunk at the Family Christmas Party and Starts Singing.'\" \"This collection of Christmas cacophony causes me to cringe. Forced to sit through it again I might very well have to hang myself by the chimney with care.\" \"Knocks William Shatner out of first place for most embarrassing vocal performance ever.\" \"Farcical at best and just plain creepy at worst.\"\n\nHad enough? I think not. You may still be considering a purchase, so permit me to present a few more carefully chosen words of warning: \"Just listening curdles my innards.\" \"Possibly the worst album ever recorded.\" \"Like being sucker punched at a birthday party.\" \"An album of Christmas music that could be used to interrogate detainees at Guantanamo Bay.\" \"Jesus Christ, I feel like climbing up on a cross after one listen.\" \"Everyone involved in performing, producing, and distributing this monstrosity should be jailed for assault.\" \"Sounds like karaoke at a nursing home.\" \"Sounds like a cross between Joe Cocker and a chainsaw.\" \"Sounds as if he's been gargling with old razor blades.\" \"Sounds like he's singing through a tracheotomy.\" \"Sounds like Swamp Thing with a cold.\" \"Dylan ruins Christmas.\"\n\nPlease, please, please: listen to a few of the flabbergasting, nausea-inducing audio clips before you buy. And then don't. Give all the money you would have spent on this abomination to charity and, if you're religious, pray that Bob doesn't make any more albums like this one.","classification":1,"fold":1}

{"text":"I'm always looking for good music to listen to and, while I had heard some of Meghan Trainor's songs on the radio, I wasn't sure if I really liked the style because I typically listen to pop and country. I kept coming back to this debut album and decided to give it a chance. The first time I listened to the album in its entirety, I was absolutely blown away by how much I love it! I found myself unable to stop dancing to the upbeat and energetic music and I've been listening to Title throughout the day today because I can't get enough of it!\n\nMeghan Trainor's extremely unique and aesthetically pleasing style is a combination of pop, hip-hop, and 50s doo wop. Listening to her songs makes me want to find a pair of roller skates and a poodle skirt while I jam to her music! Her voice is beautiful and crystal-clear with a touch of huskiness in certain parts of her songs. Upon looking at the booklet in the CD, I was amazed to discover that Ms. Trainor either wrote or co-wrote every single song, which at almost 22 years old and nearly a year after Title was released, is very impressive and shows extreme talent on her part.\n\nTitle is filled with so many good-quality, fun songs that it's hard not to like them, but there are a few that definitely stick out to me more than the others. By now, most people have probably heard her debut single \"All About That Bass,\" an upbeat, positive song about being proud to have \"all the right junk in all the right places.\" My other favorites are the funky \"Dear Future Husband,\" lively \"Lips Are Movin,\" sweet \"Close Your Eyes,\" and the latest single \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You,\" a beautiful ballad featuring John Legend. The other songs are good as well and it's hard not to get swept away and listen to this album over and over again!\n\nI absolutely LOVE Title and just wish that I had purchased it earlier but, now that I own it, I will be listening to it for awhile! Meghan Trainor's unique style has produced an album full of funky, energetic songs as well as slow and sweet ballads. I love listening to music while I exercise and Title is perfect if you also like listening to upbeat music to keep the energy flowing. If you are considering purchasing this album, just go ahead and buy it because you won't regret it! I highly recommend Title to anyone who wants to freshen up their music collection and I'm excited to see what else Meghan Trainor comes up with in the future!","classification":5,"fold":1}

I WILL say this for any of Vince's CD's...his ballads can make you cry and he has a penchant for finding backup harmony singers with incredible voices.  Same holds true here.

{"text":"Why wouldn't you want to download this FREE tuning note as the previous reviewer states? Common sense would tell you that since the other pieces included in this accompaniment backing track practice mp3 are tuned to a 443Hz, you just might want to tune also to the same 443Hz frequency or else you will find yourself playing along with the track out of tune. The pitch is provided FREE with the rest of the mp3 so that you can first tune your instrument properly then practice \"playing in tune\" with the provided backing accompaniment. I'm a classical bassist and often play transcribed violin and cello music. If you can't hear the difference between concert pitch 440Hz tuning and a concert pitch 443Hz tuning note, then you're most likely always playing out of tune with your ensemble and accompaniment. A lot of European orchestras\/symphonies tune to a concert pitch 442 or 443Hz and not the standard ISO American 440Hz. Even some American orchestras\/symphonies are following suit as the 443Hz has been found to be a more natural resonance than the established 440Hz. There is much debate on which frequency to use but best practice is that whichever frequency is provided, this is what you should tune to.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"SAM'S TOWN immediately hits the listener with a sound that is significantly different from HOT FUSS. If it wasn't for the vocals, it would be fair to say you were listening to a totally different band. This type of change is risky in a new band; the fear being that fans will be alienated. Personally, I love when bands continue to evolve and search for new sounds and themes. It keeps things from becoming boring and it prevents that, \"Didn't I hear this before?\" feeling.\n\nThe question is it successful? The answer is, \"Yes.\"\n\nHard driving anthems relating to genuine emotions triumph over artifice and The Killers pull it off very well here. Flowers' voice strains for creditability when pushed, but he pulls it off and while lacking the force of many other rockers, his vulnerability makes the songs that much better. While they don't all come off with the same power , the songs hold up in their new settings and  the total package comes together. While still not a classic, this is a worthy effort from The Killers and I hope they continue to push themselves to make music worth listening to.","classification":4,"fold":1}

Overall, this is a super album, I just wish that the audience noise at the beginning of the song could be a little more scrubbed, but I understand that it is a live recording.

It does contribute when they are singing the Chorus toward the end of the song.  I would love a great studio version of this song with a huge choir singing along.

{"text":"Ever since the release of the ultra-successful The Emancipation of MiMi, by Mariah Carey, it seems as though record labels are constantly overthinking things in order to get hits, especially when they have an artist who is truly talented on their hands, like Jennifer Hudson. That would probably explain why the best song Jennifer Hudson has ever recorded, the lovely \"Stand Up,\" is nowhere to be found here. Quite honestly, this is not the classic album I was expecting from such a talented woman. Still, there are some nice songs. \"Spotlight\" is probably the best thing on here; it's light, but forceful, and its sparse production leaves ample room for Jennifer's powerful and emtional vocal delivery. The Timbaland-produced \"Pocketbook\" is pretty much the only moment on the album where she doesn't take herself so seriously, which makes it refreshing. It's sassy and silly (\"don't make me hit you with my pocketbook\"), but the track is almost ruined by Ludacris' unnecessarily nasty rap. The Robin Thicke-penned \"Giving Myself,\" a simple and beautiful ballad, was a nice choice. The piano-laden \"My Heart\" is very catchy and an overall nice mid-tempo. \"I'm His Only Woman,\" a duet with Fantasia, pays homage to Stax-era soul. \"We Gon' Fight\" is standard Tank fare, but it's enjoyable. And the closer, a rendition of the gospel traditional \"Jesus Promised Me A Home Over There,\" shows her vocals at their best. The rest of the songs, I'm afraid, are anything but satisfying and many of them are extremely trendy, meaning that there are songs all across the radio that sound similar. Luckily, Hudson's voice elevates all of these from being embarrassingly bad, except on the biggest monstrosity: the duet with... T-Pain, \"What's Wrong (Go Away).\" 'Nuff said, it's inexcusible. \"If This Isn't Love\" is a bit too pop for my tastes. I can't believe artists are still calling up Diane Warren for songs, because in my opinion, she was finished almost a decade ago. Anyways, her addition, \"You Pulled me Through\" is pretty uninspiring. \"Can't Stop the Rain\" has a generally nice melody and has touching lyrics, but the production is very stale. \"Invisible\" isn't very exciting, either, and the chorus is too dramatic. And the inclusion of \"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\" was pretty unnecessary in my eyes, especially since I--and probably the rest of America--had grown tired of it by the time the Academy Awards came around. Contrary to what other reviewers are saying, \"All Dressed Up In Love\" is not included as a bonus track on the standard edition. As I said before, all this material is made better due to the simple fact that it's Jennifer Hudson singing, and there are six or seven good tracks. But there are just as many songs that should've been left off, and with over 40 tracks recorded for this album, you'd think Hudson and Clive Davis could've formulated a great tracklist. If you want an excellent new female R&B album, buy Jazmine Sullivan's Fearless, because this just isn't cutting it for me. Maybe next time.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"There are those Mastodon fans who favor the early stuff, the heavier, denser \"Remission\" and crushing \"Leviathan\", and shy away from later stuff because it doesn't repeat itself over and over again.  What these impatient types don't realize is that they'd be the first ones to bitch because the eighth, ninth and tenth albums all sounded alike while refusing to accept stylistic growth.\n  The rest of us relish seeing the greatest American metal band if not the greatest band in the world grow and explore.  I was absolutely obsessed with \"The Hunter\", one of the greatest albums of this century, and damn near as good as anything Zeppelin or other giants of yesteryear put out, if not better.  Typically some people disliked the experimentation and relative accessibility but that was their problem.  Not me.  I was very interested to see what they'd do for a follow up and I was and am very pleased to report that \"Once More 'Round The Sun\" is a triumph, full of the class and musicianship we expect, and rocks mightily without a hint of compromise.\n  If anything, the new album deftly mixes the more melodic vocals and guitar lines with a straight out rock and roll approach, meaning while there is not a song like \"The Creature Lives\" or one as wistful as \"The Sparrow\", we get a supercharged set that manages to move the band forward without being the weak followup to a classic, like Machine Head's failure to top the glory that was \"The Blackening\" with a decidedly weak \"Unto The Locust\".  Mastodon are simply too smart for that.\n  It's still very early, having had this CD for only a couple of listens to break it down track by track, but overall it's brilliant, and will take repeated listens to really get into, a sign of a great album that has new surprises every time you listen.  Scott Kelly makes his usual appearance, although personally I don't like his voice.  That's minor though because the music rises to the occasion, even the cheering section on \"Aunt Lisa\".  If comparisons must be made, \"Once More 'Round The Sun\" reminds me a bit of \"Bloodwork\" mixed with the hooks of \"The Hunter\", if that helps.  Pity the fool band who has to open for these guys.","classification":5,"fold":1}

It took someone (forgot his name, it's in the thank you's) who saw SOMETHING in Meghan to show her the art of pop songcraft and something clicked BIG TIME, like Taylor Swift's pseudo little sister.  Love how she combines retro 40s\/50s doo-wop and 60s girlgroup pop with 21st century issues and a drop of hiphop thrown in, a little bit of reggae\/ska as well...this girl's got a winning personality, hooks for miles (love the line in \"Dear Future Husband\"...\"I can't cook but I can write a hook...mmm sing along with me\/mmm sing along with me\", with a nod to Dion's \"Runaround Sue\" (nice)...Meghan may be \"all about that bass\", but me, I'm all about the hooks...and this whole record's got more hooks than a fisherman's tacklebox...and being from Nantucket, Mass, she knows all about those!!\n\nYes, the 4-song \"Title\" EP came out 6 months ago, and I bought it...which got me initially hooked on MT in the first place...espesh the INSANELY catchy and adorable, er, TITLE track, haha, with her fun ukulele playing...and the full deluxe \"Title\" CD (the regular one feels too skimpy and yellow tinge is actually kinda ugly)...it has all those 4 cuts, but I don't mind...I'd rather have em all together on 1 disc, and it's 46 minutes all together...not draggy long and not too short...and it's got variety, like some acapella interludes, \"Lips Are Movin\" is a great song and her John Legend duet is quite lovely...feels like 80s\/90s quiet storm R&B...\n\nA winning debut in a long career indeed...thank goodness she's actually talented...and charming...I am swooning and don't feel like a perv, haha...as for that guy who is promoting his \"Total Bull Crap\" CD??

{"text":"R. Kelly's late 2010 release is quite spectacular. The vibe, the lyrics and the lack of his lusty rhymes prove to be the ever more sexy. The track \"Music Must Be A Lady\" (the true highlight of the bunch) proves just that and attracts me like no other track on the album. It has a certain innocent sparkle to it and makes you truly feel as if you're a fan trying to look in on one of your favorite singers. The delivery is that clever. Other mainstays are \"Love Letter\", \"Just Like That\" and the bouncy, Christmas-y \"Love Is\". Likewise, Robert also ambitiously (and quite successfully) covers the late Michael Jackson's classic single \"You Are Not Alone\". It's no surprise that it sounds just as (if not more) inspired because R. Kelly wrote it for Michael to record. The only misstep on the album is the boring \"How Do I Tell Her\" which is four minutes and twenty-three seconds too long. Other than that, this one is a mean success.\n\n4.4 stars.\n\nDOWNLOAD:\n\"Music Must Be A Lady\"\n\"Just Like That\"\n\"A Love Letter Christmas\" &\n\"Not Feelin' The Love\"\n\nHONORABLE MENTION:\n\"Love Is\"","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"I have reviewed another CD compilation and this one seems to be no different. Although there are a few tracks that might be the original artists, some are not. BJ Thomas, for example, had a little \"trill\" in his voice that is missing from the recording on this CD. The singer in \"Harper Valley PTA\" lacks the \"southern kick\" Jeannie C. Riley had in her voice. There are others but I need not go on here. Just be careful of compilation recordings. As I stated in another review, the market was literally flooded with Sound-a-Likes in the seventies; and unfortunately, they are still around. Key wording during the \"infomercials\" then was, \"as recorded\/performed by the original artists\". The key word here is \"AS\", (synonymous with \"like\").\n\n Some of these are by the original artists but are \"studio cuts\" that were never intended to be released. What we heard on the radio was the \"final cut\". K-Tel was one of the biggest at this. They aired commercials as \"as performed by the original artists\" (Sound-a-Like) or \"the original recording by the original artist\". The latter here is true; it was the original first \"STUDIO CUT\" that, through license agreement with the publishers and artists, was able to be released and billed as the \"original recordings\" but not as the \"original release\" by the original artist, see the difference?\n\nI ordered one or two of these compilations during the seventies only to open the box and see the fine print and was very disappointed and was from then on very, very, wary of compilation recordings. If all you are after is the songs sung by whomever then these are great, the performers do an otherwise excellent job; but, I was blessed with absolute perfect pitch and I can tell usually within the first bar that I am not hearing the \"original release\" or artist.\n\nI give this CD three stars because the songs are great and I do like them but had the songs been performed as \"as originally released\" it would have received five stars.\n\nI would point out that there  are infomercials that air quite frequently, I will not mention the names, that advertise their music compilations \"as performed\/released by the original artists\". If there is a studio cut, there is parenthesis to let the consumer\/buyer\/listener know this, as-well-as if the song is a \"Recorded Live\" version.\n\nSo, as we learned in school: CAVEAT EMPTOR.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"There comes a time where we all have to be judgemental and not follow a crowd, or not praise or slander something or someone because it's cool to do. For those few people who've been following my reviews, I'm sure I have an idea what you're thinking. You're probably thinking, \"What Chandler?! You gave Wayne 8 out of 10 stars? You must be on that down south type ****.\" Or could it be \"What? 8 out of 10 stars? No way Chandler! I stuck by your reviews for so long, and this is how you repay me??? You gave Masta Ace, and Immortal Technique 8 stars. Is Lil' Wayne just as good as them?\" Whatever reason you're thinking why I didn't give Wayne a low score, because he's overrated and proclaims himself as \"The Best Rapper Alive\", I have a few words for you: Get a life! Just like EJ Rupert said in his review, is it cool to listen to underground and mainstream artists, without slamming one or the other? (this goes for half of you people who are on those Amazon threads as well)\n\nWell, as for Lil' Wayne himself, he hits what he proclaims as a \"3 Peat\" with his third follow up in \"Tha Carter\" trilogy. I admit, he has stepped is game up since back in '04 when he came out with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tha-Carter-1\/dp\/B00027JYPI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tha Carter 1<\/a>, which was mediocre (admit it, you only liked it because it was the cool thing to do). But in late '05\/early '06 he came much harder on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tha-Carter-II\/dp\/B000BLI4UG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tha Carter II<\/a>. So can Wayne live up to the hype that he has been swimming in for the past year. When you hear how he rips on \"Mr. Carter\" featuring Jay-Z, the answer is apparently \"yes\". No matter how you match him up with the beats, he'll put them to good use. Just check out \"A Milli\" on how he handles it (and thank you every rapper popular and non-popular for freestyling that beat into the ground). \"Dr. Carter\" has a good concept as Wayne plays a doctor to rappers who are not good. Further down the album is the great and deep song \"Tie My Hands\" featuring Robin Thike. And then is the hilarious \"La La\" with Busta Rhymes and Brisco.\n\nSongs that I don't like in particular is the second single \"Ms. Officer\" (that song get mass amount of airplay, and that \"weedle weedle weedle\" sound is VERY annoying). Some songs just don't make sense, such as \"P***y Monster\" and \"Phone Home\" (trying to be E.T. there huh?)\n\nOverall, a great album. Wayne has hit a high mark in his career. Is he the best rapper alive? No, but he getting up there with everybody else. Which brings me to another thing: Record sales do not determine how great a rapper's skills are. Just becaue Wayne sold \"A Milli\" in a week, does no make this album the best ever made. Many albums have leaps and bounds over this and barely hit platnum (ex: Nas'&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Illmatic\/dp\/B0000029GA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Illmatic<\/a>&nbsp;was relesed in 1994, but didn't go gold until '96 and platnum until 2001). Lil' Wayne may have done his job as an artist with an excellent album. Just like The Rolling Stone Magazine said in their review \"Believe The Hype\" (and gave this 4 1\/2 stars). For me, it's 8 out of 10 in my opinion. Peace.\n\nLyrics: B+\nProduction: B+\nGuest Appearances: B\nMusical Vibes: A-\n\nTop 5 Tracks:\n1. Mr. Carter (featuring Jay-Z)\n2.

{"text":"less than a year ago Allen Toussaint left us after a concert in Madrid, made him after finishing the sessions of this album under the magical production of Joe Henry. The album is a continuation in a sense the wonderful \"The Bright Mississippi\". It is an album full of melancholy and emotion. After his title \"American tunes\" a gem of other times hidden, another way of understanding music, sounds belonging to that wonderful city that is New Orleans. It is a very classic and evocative album. Today you can not understand this city without their music. Arranger, composer and musician who distills New Orleans from every pore. It is difficult to explain all these feelings and all the experience behind her notes, HOWEVER Joe Henry has done it. Beautiful themes, emotional voices and musicians first, Bill Frisell, Van Dyke Parks, Charles LLoyd ... but especially his piano. Always on the front line of sound, always evocative ... The man who got love Costello, The Band ... and many others. There are issues of Allen piano solo, intrumentales issues and sung, but always exciting and splendid. New Orleans always background, always with magnificent arrangements, always with class and simplicity already lost. An eternal CD that transports us to another place to other feelings. Magnifico, an indisputable classic. Eternal glory to Allen Toussaint. Great ","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Hard to believe we've waited 13 years for new James Taylor songs, but \"Before This World\" was well worth the wait. His voice, still pure and world-weary has changed little over the decades, even matured a bit, The songs are comfortable, like your old blue jeans. He waxes nostalgic on \"Stretch Of The Highway,\" touches a political nerve on \"Far Afghanistan,\" and lays claim to an oldie for \"Wild Mountain Thyme.\"\n\nThis is aural comfort food, impeccably produced with some lush orchestrations and often offering breathing space between the singer and his songs (IMHO a lost art among many current artists). The harmonies are lovely and there's even a drop by from Sting (on the title track). I particularly like \"Angels Of Fenway,\" a tribute both to his Grandmother and a salute to the 2004 World Series winning Boston Red Sox. As a fellow member of Red Sox Nation, I've been wanting to hear the studio version ever since he sang it live at Fenway Park in early May (broadcast on NESN). I was not disappointed.\n\n\"Somehow I haven't died,\" James croons over the opening mellow folksiness of \"Today Today Today.\" \"Before the World\" often looks back at his life, and to our benefit, James sound confident enough that maybe the next album will come before a 13 year gap occurs. But for now, enjoy \"Before This World.\" Where singer\/songwriters are concerned, there just isn't anyone to compare to James Taylor.","classification":4,"fold":1}

It would be fair to say that these were the albums that really established Katherine's reputation following her promising debut album, which isn't represented here at all.\n\nIt's possible to argue what should have been included. The compilers had a hard job in selecting seventeen tracks that represent the best of Katherine's Decca music. No doubt the selection was influenced by the need to ensure that the album qualified for inclusion in the classical music charts, as all but one of her earlier albums did. This may explain the absence of Katherine's exquisite covers of We'll meet again, You'll never walk alone and Amazing grace, to name but three popular songs that I would like to have seen included. But I am pleased that Decca chose to include Don't cry for me Argentina. This was not included on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Living-A-Dream\/dp\/B000AD1IUI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Living A Dream<\/a>&nbsp;, but it was included in a deluxe edition of the same album. I decided not to pay the premium price for just that track and one other. There's also a deluxe edition of this collection,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Katherine-Jenkins-The-Ultimate-Collection-Special-Edition\/dp\/B002MT2X5W\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Katherine Jenkins: The Ultimate Collection \/ Special Edition<\/a>, containing a second CD featuring eight live tracks, but again I opted for the standard edition.\n\nWhether this truly is the ultimate collection of her music, this compilation certainly provides a great introduction to the music of Katherine Jenkins.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"It took awhile to get some decent 5th Dimension collections on cd. Now it can numb the mind trying to sort them out. The two-disc Up Up And Away: The Definitive Collection has every hit but Harlem, yet also includes quite a few filler album tracks of varying quality.\nThis ULTIMATE disc is a lot leaner (21 tracks instead of 36), but also has most of their singles. The initial hit Go Where You Wanna Go presented the 5th as folk-rock clones of the Mamas and the Papas. With the follow-up singles, the 5th created their own niche by frequently utilizing the exceptional songwriting talents of Jimmy Webb and Laura Nyro. Webb upped the emphasis on pure pop by providing the 5th with Up-Up And Away and Carpet Man. When the 5th moved on to the Nyro material like Stoned Soul Picnic and Sweet Blindness, a good deal of soul entered into the mix. By 1969, the 5th Dimension sound hit its apex as the Hair medley Aquarius\/Let The Sunshine In and cover of Nyro's Wedding Bell Blues dominated the airwaves. Aside from the McCoo-led Wedding Bell Blues, these '60s singles were very much a group effort and a lesson in harmonic bliss.\nThe 5th's biggest hit of the '70s, the moving One Less Bell To Answer, was practically a solo Marilyn McCoo recording and signaled a strong change in direction for the group. Thereafter, all of their most successful singles would be easylistening McCoo-dominated numbers like Love's Lines, Angles and Rhymes, (Last Night) I Didn't Get To Sleep At All, and the stirring If I Could Reach You. Great performances all, but they sadly wasted the group's greatest strengths: their peerless harmonies and their adeptness at various musical styles (they weren't originally called the Versatiles for nothing!) The singles which featured the entire group during the '70s may not have been as prosperous at radio, but they have their moments, particularly Save The Country and Puppet Man.\nBesides the always left off Harlem, there are other hits missing from this set: the glorious Light Sings and their live album's Together Lets Find Love (both are on the Definitive Collection). Instead, the final track is a non-hit take on the standard \"Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye\" that is not available on any other 5th Dimension retrospectives.\nIf you want a strong sampling of the 5th's best work and you can live without some of the hits, this single disc set is okay.  But do yourself a favor and go with the far more complete UP UP and Away: The Definitive Collection instead.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"It is honestly a heartbreaking moment, whenever somebody talented & gifted dies with a broken heart. When I had heard about the devastating death of Dolores O' Riordan, whom had fronted the cranberries throughout the 90's, I was shocked. It is so sad that she would die in the same way that we had lost George Michael a little over a year ago. She had a unique gift, but sadly, she let it go to waste, just as much with the same demons that plagued other divas whom had died young like Amy Winehouse and Whitney Houston. When I do think of their music, I think of it as a ladies' alternative to the success that U2 had garnered throughout the decades in hard rock. There have been some of The Cranberries songs that still do stand out today, but Linger was the first hit that still remains as stark and haunting, as the day it had came out. It truly is a song worth noticing from the soul, especially if you have never heard a Cranberries song before. This is the song that I sincerely recommend that you do go to first, as a everlasting memory to Dolores.\n\nDolores O' Riordan: 1971-2018\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"According to Billboard they were among the top recording acts of the 1980's. Over a period spanning 16 years beginning in 1974 they recorded for three different labels, placed nearly three dozen singles on the Top 100 Singles chart and had several highly successful albums to boot. Yes, the music of Daryl Hall and John Oates seemed to be everywhere during this period.\n\nHall and Oates began their recording career at Atlantic records in the early 1970's. In 1974, they had a minor hit with a tune called \"She's Gone\". Although this record was not wildly successful it was clear that these guys were going to be a force to be reckoned with in the coming years. RCA records took note and signed Hall & Oates in 1975. Their very first release for the label \"Sara Smile\" was on the charts for some 7 months and peaked at #3 in the spring of 1976. Atlantic records took note and re-released \"She's Gone\" which also became a Top Ten hit in '76.  In January 1977 RCA released the boys' third single.  \"Rich Girl\" would become the first of six #1 singles for Hall & Oates spending two weeks at the top of the charts In March of that year.  As far as I am concerned this is one of the best songs they ever recorded.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"As a child growing up in the projects of New Jersey, Jaheim Hoagland accumulated more emotional baggage than all of JFK international airport.  Having lost his father at two years old, he spent most of his childhood doing the street thug thing, getting into all sorts of petty trouble while being raised in a single-parent household.  But when his mother passed away when he was 17, the pain of his loss inspired him to aggressively pursue a recording career, and 4 years later his debut, \"Ghetto Love,\" was released.  To be certain, that record wasn't perfect, and it had its share of filler.  But what made it worth the trip was Jaheim's voice, which had me do double-takes to make sure I wasn't listening to a Teddy Pendegrass record.  On his superior, impressive second album, \"Still Ghetto,\" the flava is r&b with a dash of hip hop, but the influences are clearly rooted in the old school.  Throughout its trip of nearly an hour, \"Still Ghetto\" is honest, rugged, and soulful.  Thematically, it's not a huge departure from his debut, as the majority of the songs pertain to relationships and the drama that sometimes comes with them.  Mary J. Blige openly gave Jaheim props in a Rolling Stone article, and she appears in the impressive duet, \"Beauty and Thug,\" in which the Queen of Hip Hop Soul's bruised voice goes hand-in-hand with his husky voice.  He glides effortlessly through the ultrasmooth slow jam \"Long As I Live,\" and I don't even need to explain what the song \"Tight Jeans\" is about.  \"Still Ghetto\" is essentially the record Tank's \"One Man\" should have been.  The latter record suffered from tired beats and half-inspired singing, but on \"Still Ghetto,\" Jaheim pulls it off with flying colors.  He may be a little rough on the edges, and some may even question his choice of words (um, \"Me and My B----,\" anyone?), but there's no denying his honesty.  Some records keep it real, and others keep it right.  This record does both.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"It's been a long time since Type O Negative have been on the scene. Too long, as a matter of fact. 2003 saw the release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Life-Is-Killing-Me\/dp\/B00009PJPT\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Life Is Killing Me<\/a>&nbsp;and the band seemed to all but vaporize since. Rest assured, however, the boys from Brooklyn are back, and frontman Peter Steele has gone through enough of a personal Hell to inspire one of the best albums of their career. \"Dead Again,\" Type O's seventh studio album sounds just as fresh as the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Bloody-Kisses\/dp\/B000000H6Y\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bloody Kisses<\/a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/October-Rust\/dp\/B000000H57\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">October Rust<\/a>, leaving no fan disappointed in it's wake.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a fanboy, I must say that this album totally blew my mind. Listening to it, I get the same feelings I did when I took my first listen of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Bloody-Kisses\/dp\/B000000H6Y\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bloody Kisses<\/a>&nbsp;oh so many years ago. It's hard to believe how long these guys have been at it, and that they have yet to get stale or boring. Whether it's the triumphant opening title track, or the gloomy ballad, \"September Sun,\" Type O Negative touch on all their previous material here, while still keeping it relevant. Others like \"Tripping A Blind Man,\" \"An Ode To Locksmiths\" and \"She Burned Me Down\" are the cream of the crop, with their punch-in-the-gut riffs that bring back old school Black Sabbath (something that Type O are the best at). Even a song like \"These Three Things,\" which clocks in at over fourteen minutes, is impossible not to enjoy. And if I'm not mistaken, I can hear a bit of confidence in Steele's voice like never before. For the first time, he truly sounds like he is releasing his demons through his music.\n\n\"Dead Again\" is quite possibly the most accessible Type O Negative record available. Granted, you're not going to be hearing this stuff on the radio much, but if you were ever a Type O Negative fan, there is surely something here for you. They are one of the few bands that can create an album that matches their earlier work without it sounding like a shameless rehash. This is easily the most inspired Type O have been in ten years. Everyone who cares for this band owes it to themselves to own a copy of \"Dead Again.\"","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"\"The Inevitable End\" is Norwegian duo Ryksopp's fifth and supposedly final album, which is such a shame. Fittingly perhaps, the sound is brooding and melancholic with ambient washes, despite the odd raised tempo here and there on songs such as a reworking of \"Monument\" (which featured in a different version on their \"Do It Again\" EP with Robyn, who appears again on the moody ballad \"Rong\"), opening cut the vocoder-driven Daft Punk-esque \"Skulls\", the jittery \"Save Me\" featuring Susanne Sundfr, or \"I Had This Thing\" featuring Jamie Irrepressible.\n\nTheir 2001 debut \"Melody AM\" was incredible, and this is just as great. Everything stands out really; the dreamy gently-pulsing \"Sordid Affair\" featuring Man Without Country (what an interesting name), the 7 minute-long dirge-like ballad \"You Know I Have To Go\" featuring a mournful Jamie Irrepressible, the dark yet serenely beautiful \"Here She Comes Again\" featuring the elegiac croon of Jamie Irrepressible over clipped beats (he appears again on the hypnotic \"Compulsion\" which winds down and changes tempo near its end), the pulsing \"Running To The Sea\" featuring an echoey Susanne Sundfr and a lovely piano intro, the ethereal and incredibly beautiful instrumental \"Coup De Grace\" (which sounds like the soundtrack to some movie), and closing cut \"Thank You\" which finds the pair singing in unison using a vocoder giving way to a lovely lengthy instrumental.\n\nAn incredible swan song from a supremely talented pair.

{"text":"The problem with Boys Like Girls' 2006 self-titled debut was that the group sounded like a mid-decade answer to earlier bands such as Simple Plan or Good Charlotte. It was easy to imagine putting various CDs into a stereo and hitting the shuffle button only to guess which group was blaring through the speakers. A few tracks share this on new sophomore set \"Love Drunk,\" but the majority retain distinct flavor.\n\nThe verses surrounding the chorus of the Top 40 title track are probing and intriguing, and the jagged, fluctuating ear candy chorus of opening cut \"Heart Heart Heartbreak,\" another potential hit single, indicates that the band has grown stronger. \"The Real Thing,\" which smacks of Bon Jovi (in this case, a good thing) has an awesome lyric which works in all the right spots - relatable sans cliches, stream-of-conscious without being offbeat - as well as a winning, bombastic melody and awesome guitar riffs.\n\nThese are the kinds of songs that stick around in the minds of listeners upon repeated plays without wearing out their welcome prematurely, and they make merely adequate tracks like \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\" and the cute but less interesting \"Contagious\" sound better by rubbing against them.\n\nOf particular interest are the ballads, the best of which find the band hitting a particular stride and threshold of quality. It is a lyrically banal coming-of-age tune, but \"Someone Like You,\" with its solid, memorable melody and soul-searching, emotionally sincere vocal performance from frontman Martin Johnson elevate it to a stone cold winner. The lo-fi closer \"Go\" has beauty and bite,  and \"Two Is Better Than One,\" which is aided more by Taylor Swift's big-thing-of-the-moment star power than quality vocals (she does fine, but technically she is not ideal), is a potential monster hit with its sweeping arrangements and over-the-top romantic idealism. It is precision-tooled to win over legions of young women and annoy their boyfriends for extended lengths of time.\n\n\"Love Drunk\" is a sturdy collection of tunes that avoids the sophomore slump. Boys Like Girls up their ante considerably. This record is bound to spin off hits for at least a year.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"First let me say, based on what I've read the record companies have waived their usual fees so ALL of the money from sales goes directly to the Japan Red Cross. If that's so, bravo to them. Currently the mp3 and CD goes for around ten dollars. That may not seem like much to donate to such a needed cause, but when many thousands of people do it...$$$.\n\nNow for the music, other than the Lady Gaga track it looks to me like everything here is available elsewhere. Some songs are old, some songs are newer, but almost nothing is exclusive to this collection (usually a reason to buy). Also fyi, a number of the songs are the live versions: RHCP, Madonna, Josh Groban, REM, Sting. Songs from Eminem and Nicki Minaj are the clean versions. One big plus is that Songs For Japan is two discs worth of music, so we get 38 songs! 19 on each disc, which is about as full as a CD can be. (Currently the CD edition isn't showing the Madonna or David Guetta tracks).\n\nThere's no doubt few people want every song here, but at 38 cents a track you can't beat it. It's like getting 28 songs for free. Normally I'd never give most of these songs 5 stars, but for the quantity, the quality and the cause....5 stars.

{"text":"There is honestly no question that there sincerely has been a huge lag of female artists that could've had more of the talent, if they actually delivered with better choices in song. That has not been the case with acts like Rihanna or Beyonce, which have had more overexposure as products, not people. Unfortunately, that also has been the case with Fifth Harmony. They just haven't had the chemistry that other girl groups have had from En Vogue, Salt N' Pepa or even The Supremes. When I heard their last single Write On Me, I thought they were growing up with better chemistry in their work, but the third single is more like a lag in their song choices. All In My Head (Flex,) the third single from their second album 7\/27, tries to bring in a more reggae style in their works. Unfortunately, it didn't feel like the gals delivered, and tried to do what Tamar Braxton did last year with Angels & Demons, that fell down from the sounds the diva could've brought out. For Fifth Harmony, I found this song to lag from the exposure they've received from Worth It last year. Hopefully, the gals of Fifth Harmony can find much better than what they've already came out with.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":1}

They continue not to be jaded by the industry. I have always liked the fact they they don't try hard to be mainstream. This is something a lot of other bands should try. I miss the wide open approach they had with the \"Definition of a Band or Life's Aquarium\".\n  The band does continue to show their creative side. I just want more of it. I like the songs \"Mind Slicker\" nice groove cut, also \"Ease the Pain\", there is also, \"I Want It\" which could have been Part1 of \"I want it Again\" with a twist. \"Walk On\" is a nice ballad, the same can be said for \"20 Years later\". I do miss the early energy of the band. I remember when the opened for Janet Jackson back in the day, I knew they were special. I am also glad they did not comprimise their musical integrity. Too bad though they don't get the \"AIRPLAY\" they deserve, as they are one of the last great R&B bands of the last 20 Years. So if you like their previous works, add this to the collection. Now I want a danceable CD from them one more time. Overall, this is a great cd. I really like the \"Live cuts\" they give you an insight to what they are all about.

{"text":"Shante \"Curren$y\" Franklin has maybe the best butter drawl ever put on tape over beats, his verses melting over soulful, often-funky beats not at all unlike how Snoop's words did back when Dr. Dre and The D.O.C. were still holding his hand. His background set in NOLA's famous Third Ward - home not only all the big No Limit Records names from the late 90s, but also Louis Armstrong and Dr. John - Curren$y has always had a lot of real life fodder, and thus a lot to say, on his records. As his ear for production gets stronger and stronger, and his drawl more endearing, expectations for Franklin grow, so much so that his fans now stand almost no chance of being satisfied with Stoned Immaculate, Curren$y's first major release through Warner Bros. and most ambitious record yet.\n\nThree of his last four albums, all of which were released in the last two or so years, already considered to be minor modern classics, Curren$y decided to switch up his formula for his major debut. Each of those four records were short, recorded in a matter of days, light on the guests spots and, more or less, produced by one beatmaker. Stoned couldn't be more different. It's not that the record is long or even overly complex, but it's definitely a big project album. Lots of guests, lots of producers and lots of verses and hooks and styles. Rather than taking two days to record like, say, last year's great Weekend at Burnie's did, Stoned was recorded over several months, Franklin even having to utilize the Powers-That-Be at Warners to make some of the needed connections. The result is a diverse, detailed album that, while still a solid display of Franklin's vocal ability, feels far less cohesive than Burnie's or the two Pilot Talk installments. Summer classics, those.\n\nAs is always the case with Curren$y, repeat listens do reward. No, you likely won't love Stoned like you maybe did Franklin's other recent recordings, but there's much here to grab on to if you like low-key, soul-influenced hip-hop records with, again, butter vox. And, of course, with each Curren$y disc you get at least that one new classic. In this case, that song is the Tone-P-produced \"Chandelier,\" a hook-heavy track that sees Curren$y really stepping up his storytelling game. Another big standout, and possible new hip-hop classic, is \"Sunroof,\" produced by Curren$y regular Monsta Beatz. Like most of the tracks Curren$y selects, the otherwise good production features thin, tinny, slap drums. Unfortunate.\n\nSo no, Stoned Immaculate isn't the new hip-hop classic so many hoped it would be. What made past Curren$y discs so great was the simplicity and cohesiveness of the records. Here we have 12 guest vocalists and 11 producers over 13 tracks. Gag. Franklin doesn't even open up his own album, leaving that duty to lesser emcee Wale, who dominates the first track from the jump. Big mistake. Hopefully Franklin gets over the new power that accompanied his first real major label contract and refocuses himself. Personally, I'd like to see the guy do a short album with no guest vocalists and one producer. Might I suggest Organized Noize, Madlib or even No I.D., who produced the whole of last year's criminally underrated new Common album, The Dreamer \/ The Believer? Something tells me the lukewarm reaction to this just-decent-enough disc will put a fire under Franklin's stoner ass. Regardless, he remains one of the best mainstream emcees currently releasing records, and Stoned Immaculate has some good summertime stoner jams.\n\nFor more of my music- and film-related writing, head over to ZeCatalist.com.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"It has been over twenty years since Toni Braxton first made it big as a prodigy of Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds with the song Give U My Heart from the film Boomerang. But it has been a long time since Toni made a good album. Her last album, 2010's Pulse was strong in voice and song, but heavily overlooked in favor of the flooding and oversaturation of cheaper artists like Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles, that died with good songs and the credibility of the voice in the process. But with Toni's sister Tamar breaking out nicely, the question is that does Toni still have it? Well, yes and no. Hurt You, her new duet with Babyface, is not actually as striking as the duets and collaborations Toni had years ago. It wasn't a bad effort but not showstopping, as Toni's earlier songs. Hearing this and Tamar's Love & War, I liked Tamar's song a little bit better. Hopefully, there will be more exciting music from Toni though soon.

Im also lucky to have been able to hear this song online and on radio station across the various states that my husband and I have lived (florida, Maryland, Virginia). From my perspective, all mixed up by 311 appears to be about figuring out the wisest actions and the best ways for an individual to go along in their life while successfully separating a sea of both critical and well-meaning people who may be trying to steer a man or woman another way. With the lyrics, trust your instincts, Im guessing that all mixed up by 311 symbolizes tuning into your intuition as the smoothest way to go when trying to successfully separate what a person wishes to personally do in comparison to what their critics, friends, and\/or family members may tell them.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"With Matraca Berg writing so many songs for other country artists, in recent years we haven't had as many opportunities to hear her sing her own songs.  The Dreaming Fields is a nice return for her.  I've seen it categorized a few places as \"folk,\" but to my ears most of these songs still sound like country.  It is country in the vein of Rosanne Cash's music or the like, singer-songwriter stuff.  Listen to \"Clouds\" with its exquisite pedal steel work, and see if it sounds like country or folk to you.  I'm going with country.  One nod in the other direction, the wistful title tune, does have a traditional folk air to it.\n\nThe song lyrics to all eleven of these songs are available on the artist's web site, along with songwriting credits.  I noticed that several of Matraca's peers have joined her in writing the new tunes, including Gretchen Peters, Deanna Carter and Suzy Bogguss.  There's also a song co-written with actress Mary Steenburgen, \"Fall Again.\"\n\nMs Berg is in good voice on The Dreaming Fields, and the backing musicians are all excellent.  Among my favorite new songs are the sweet \"Oh Cumberland,\" \"Racing the Angels\" (which sounds Emmylou Harris-ish, and is an instant classic), and a bluesy-funny number, \"Your Husband's Cheating On Us.\"  The whole album is good, though.","classification":4,"fold":1}

The combined effect of 60's girl group hooks and noisy approach is actually what the Raveonettes tried without any success to attain on their recordings. The Dum Dum Girls actually succeed mainly because they have more talent, actually  belong  to a real scene where this kind of music does naturally occur and they are less poseurs than that other group.

{"text":"The Bach Guild's new releases -- The Big Great Symphony Box Volume 1 and 2 -- both offer a mix of re-releases from their previous offerings plus enough new material to keep loyal followers of the series (like me) interested. If you haven't been buying these boxes in their composer-focused releases, these sets are both no-brainers.\n\nI have been buying the sets from the beginning, so for me there are a lot of repeats here. But I still found enough tantalizing new material to get me to happily plunk down 99 cents apiece for these collections.\n\nHere is a track listing of this set, Volume 1, with an indication of composers and repeats, where applicable:\n\n1-4  Dvorak No. 9 - \"From the New World\"\n5-8  Beethoven No. 3 - \"Eroica\" (repeat from Big Beethoven Box)\n9-12  Beethoven No. 5 (repeat from Big Beethoven Box)\n13-16 Mozart No. 41 - \"Jupiter\" (repeat from Big Mozart Box)\n17-20 Mendelssohn No. 4 - \"Italian\"\n21-24 Schubert No. 5 (repeat from Big Schubert Box)\n25-28 Schubert No. 6 - \"Little C major\" (repeat from Big Schubert Box)\n29-32 Haydn No. 101 - \"The Clock\" (repeat from Big Haydn Box)\n33-36 Haydn No. 103 - \"Drumroll\" (repeat from Big Haydn Box)\n37-41 Beethoven No. 6 - \"Pastoral\" (repeat from Big Beethoven Box)\n42-46 Berlioz - Symphonie Fantastique\n47-48 Schubert No. 8 - \"Unfinished\" (repeat from Big Schubert Box)\n49-52 Schubert No. 9 - \"The Great\" (repeat from Big Schubert Box)\n53-56 Beethoven No. 7 (repeat from Big Beethoven Box)\n57-60 Mendelssohn No. 5 - \"Reformation\"\n61-64 Mozart No. 40 (repeat from Big Mozart Box)\n\nSo for me, the new material included four symphonies, all performed by the winning combination of the Vienna State Opera Symphony and Vladimir Golschmann: Dvorak 9, Mendelssohn 4 and 5, and the Berlioz \"Symphonie Fantastique\". While I never have cared all too greatly for the Berlioz, I enjoyed the others quite a bit.\n\nThe previously released symphonies are winners, especially the surprisingly (for me) dynamic Beethoven recordings by Sir Adrian Boult with the Philharmonic Promenade Orchestra.\n\nTechnical quality is good (although I have only listened to the new-to-me tracks -- I trust the others are the same as in their original releases). Bitrates are variable and average 186-284 kbps. Total download size for those who dare is 995 MB for 9.3 hours of music.\n\nRecommended for anybody at the introductory price. A great deal even for Bach Guild followers.","classification":5,"fold":1}

The new project is called WhoCares and features a treasure chest of tunes from the pasts of both of the heavy metal monsters.\n\nThe collection includes their 2011 singles for charity, Out of Mind  and Holy Water. These two songs included help from Metallica's Jason Newsted, the late Jon Lord from Deep Purple, Iron Maiden's Nicko McBrain and Linde Lindstrom. Together, they formed the super group, WhoCares.\n\nOther tracks on this 2-CD, 18 song collection is two previously unreleased Iommi tunes that feature Glenn Hughes and Zero The Hero from the Born Again album.\n\nGillan said of the effort, \"As I said once in the song, Razzle Dazzle, it's a real fine line between an orgy of destruction and a wonderful time.  The destruction of conformity in this case: some of the pieces never really fitted into their contemporary program and got sidelined or forgotten, and some of the album tracks never had much exposure.  As the track listing for this album came together, I noticed many of the titles had character similarities: a combination of freshness as they finally felt the sun on their backs and rebellion in a `yeah told you so' kind of way.  And that adds up to a wonderful time and more money for the music school we are building in Armenia\".\n\nGillan added, \"The ad-hoc benefit WhoCares band was just a band put together by Tony Iommi and myself on a flight home from Yerevan where we'd been deeply humbled by the honor and expectation bestowed upon us.  Well, that's it, really, in a nutshell, so to speak. What more can I say?  It's all there in the music.\"\n\nWhether you're a Deep Purple fan, a Black Sabbath fan or just love heavy metal in general, WhoCares is a must-have collection for your listening library.\n\nBoomerocity.com","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Great freaking organic sounding song, perhaps the best on the album.  It sums up what most of the album is.  Guest vocalists with the electric sound and funk of Daft Punk.  The song is really great when it breaks down at the end and Daft Punk performs the chorus in their robotic voice.  Daft Punk is the original anonymous EDM band.  Coming off an amazing Tron Album you will not be disappointed by Get Lucky and their other songs.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"\"Made in California\" is , a gorgeous, six CD set, 473 minutes of audio and a massiave 174 tracks.  The box set also features 60 previously unreleased tracks (including 17 live tracks)  The box self is a follow up to the 1993 career spanning boxset set of \"Good Vibrations\".  The box set also contains a 1959 essay by Brian Wilson entitled \"My Philosophy\".  Like \"Good Vibrations\", \"Made in California\" follows the band's career chronologically with the exception of the very last \"From the Vaults\" disk.\n\nA major draw of any such archival project as this are the unreleased tracks.  Of the 60 rare tracks, there are several, legitimately rare, unreleased recordings, with the key tracks being \"Goin' To The Beach,\" \"California Feelin',\" \"Soul Searchin',\" \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling,\" and \"You're Still A Mystery\".  However, the majority of the tracks comprise of instrumental tracks, alternate mixes, vocal sessions, radio spots, and a lot of live recordings.\n\nNone of the unreleased material is quite as important or on the same par as the unreleased material from \"Good Vibrations\" (which was largely due to the thirty minutes of  \"SMiLE\" from Disk 2), but collectors will find some worthwhile stuff here. While the SMiLE recordings were always essential to the narrative of The Beach Boys, none of the unreleased songs here really change or add anything to their musical canon on the same scale. Also, given the cornucopia of music and sheer wealth of material we got on \"The Smile Sessions\", perhaps we had been a little spoiled.\n\nBut these concerns are largely nitpicking.  More Beach Boys music is great, and while maybe not as stunning as the unreleased material from \"Good Vibrations\" or nearly as essential, the unreleased music of \"Made in California\" is pretty great stuff (even if some of the live stuff is iffy at times).\n\nOf the 114 remaining tracks, you have a lot of the essential Beach Boy tracks, although for such an expansive collection, there are some key tracks missing, including \"She Knows Me Too Well,\" \"Getting Hungry,\" \"Funky Pretty,\" and \"You Need a Mess of Help to Stand Alone\".  Just be aware that even though this is key set there are still some rather inextricable omissions (which there always seems to be for whatever band)\n\nAlso, \"Made in America\" shows just how many times The Beach Boys' discography has been remastered over the years, with various tracks being remastered at various times, which can create an aural inconsistency over such a large set as this.  There are mixes from 2003, 2007, 2009, 2012, and 2013.\n\nFor example, \"Salt Lake City\" is a 2001 Stereo mix, \"Let Him Run Wild\" is a 2007 stero mix and \"Graduation Day \" is a 2007 stereo mix (Disk 2, tracks 5-8).  \"Barbara Ann\" is a 2012 stereo mix.  Five songs from \"Pet Sounds\" include four 1996 stereo mixes (an album which was famously mixed in mon) as well as one 2001 stereo mix.  Although the set is arranged chronologically, we are getting mixes that range from the original releases to mixes (of which there are several) done as late as 2012!  Oddly enough, there is also a stereo mix of \"Heroes and Villians\" and \"Wonderful\" from the 1967 \"Smiley Smile\" album that are 2012.  Given the massive \"The Smile Sessions\" of 2011, not sure why they were still mixing in 2012.\n\nIn terms of The Beach Boys' career, since 2011, Beach Boy fans have been in something of a Paradise, a full on celebration of the Wilson brothers, cousins, and everyone's favorite surfer dudes.  2011 saw the release of the infamous \"The SMiLE Sessions\" with \"finished version\" of the album (well, as finished as SMiLE can be, given how incomplete several of the recordings are).  In 2012, the band marked their 50th anniversary with a new (and fantastic) album (!!!) called \"That's Why God Made the Radio\", along with a great live summer tour.\n\n\"That's Why God Made the Radio\" marks the first time Brian Wilson recorded with the 1988 \"Still Cruisin'\" project that produced \"Kokomo\".  However, \"Still Cruisin'\" featured several re-recordings of their 1960s material along with a few new tracks.  It was also the first original studio album by the band since the critically panned \"Summer In Paradise\" from 1992 (twenty years previously), where they sounded little more than a parody of themselves and even had John Stamos in his Full House Uncle Jesse personae singing lead on the 1969 classic \"Forever\".  They also did a country covers album where they are little more than a backing band to various current country acts on the 1996 \"Stars and Stripes Forever Vol 1\".  While better than \"Summer in Paradise\", the last side about \"Stars and Stripes\" the better.  Thankfully they had the good sense not to issue a Vol 2.\n\nAll that being said, for Beach Boy fans, they had precious little in terms of new material from the band for over two decades.  Thankfully, though, the 50th anniversary really united the band and gave them a common drive, which is good, given how dysfunctional they have been throughout the entirety of their career (keeping up with who was suing who in the Beach Boys camp was like trying to predict the on any given day who Van Halen's lead singer was going to be).  Closing out the celebrations is \"Made in California\"\n\nFor those wanting to really get into The Beach Boys, you may be better served by going with \"Pet Sounds\" first or \"SMiLE\", as this set represents a significant investment.  The unreleased stuff will largely appeal only to collectors (with a few key exceptions).  However, for those wanting to pick up a bunch of Beach Boys in a very nice set that is career-spanning, this is a better choice than \"Good Vibrations\", especially since the main draw of \"Good Vibrations\" (the \"SMiLE\" recordings) has been completely negated with \"The SMiLE Sessions.\n\nOverall, even given the somewhat inconsequential nature of some of the outtakes and omissions of some key tracks, \"Made in California\" is a great way to end the 50th Anniversary celebration of the Wilson family's legacy.\n\nCD 1 (1961-1965)\nHome Recordings \/ \"Surfin'\" Rehearsal Highlights (2012 Edit - Mono) (Brian Wilson, Mike Love)\n\"Surfin'\" (with Session Intro - Mono) (B.

{"text":"Country music band Lonestar is celebrating 20 years in the music business and has re-united with their original lead singer Richie McDonald in this new CD release titled 'Life As We Know It' (12 tracks). They play it 'safe' in this new CD, dishing out enjoyable country music (but with a fierce competition of wonderful great country music released this year already, only time will tell if they will be able to make a decent mark in this arena).\n\nStand-outs\/gems\/my favourites are the ballads \"With My Eyes Open\" (incredible melody & chorus) & \"Just The Rain\". Not far off are \"May Be Someday\" (great banjo\/orchestral\/violin play) & \"I Miss When\" (great harmonies). Good tracks are \"The Countdown\" (the opening up-tempo track), \"Pretty Good Day\" (great guitar work), \"Life As We Know It\" (title track), \"If It Wasn't For You\", \"I Did It For The Girl\" & \"Oh Yeah\" (pop-ish\/rocky track). Okay\/weak tracks are the slow \"How Can She Be Everywhere\" & the mid-tempo \"Party All Day\".\n\nOn overall, Lonestar have a good CD release 'Life As We Know It', it has both highs and lows and the band played it 'safe' in this effort. How much mark will it have in this highly competitive genre, only time will tell. If you are a Lonestar fans, you'll enjoy this one. A recommended CD listening.","classification":4,"fold":1}

I first heard the name on MSNBC's Reality TV questions column, before the song's monumental success. Soon after that column, the song rocketed up the charts, and while I don't think it #1, it came pretty darn close, and still remains a download favorite a couple years later.\n\nThe song itself is good, not great. The vocals match and work with the song, the lyrics are good, and the piano works very well with the song. However, it kind of gets sappy after awhile. And again, after the radio long wheres out it's welcome, you're cursing the radio to stop playing that darn song.\n\nSo overall, a nice song, but it'll where on you after awhile, but it'll stay long after it's welcome, so beware.

It was the films star,the late Whitney Houston and her production company that secured the rights to this film a decade and a half ago. Production began last year but sadly Houston passed on earlier this year. So what was meant as a comeback for her wound up being a few songs on an album that will sadly be her musical epitaph as it were. At the same time some fresher faces,along with new material not in the original film make this a major winner.\n\n  The film may be a remake but the music is not. This time good enough to feature the original cast of the film the music captures the mid 70's pop\/soul flavors of the original through the filter of modern retro soul. Cee Lo Green's powerful opener \"I'm A Man\" drips with his usual energy,passion and fire. The main cast of Carmen Ejogo,Tika Sumpter and Jordin Sparks really let loose on Carmen's \"Yes I Do\",Jordin's powerful gospel inspired ballads \"Look Into Your Heart\",\"One Wing\" and \"Love Will\",all written by R.Kelly and together on the swining \"Hooked On Your Love\" and of course the classic \"Something He Can Feel\". Goapele really lets go on the hard grooving and melodically challenging \"Running\". As for Whitney's part on \"His Eye Is On The Sparrow\" she belts out gospel in her latter day huskier voice,which here she's really learned to bring the power out on.\n\n  This brings me to my favorite number \"Celebrate\",a cleanly danceable funky soul romp (again written by R.Kelly) with the Jordin Sparks and Whitney duetting beautifully together,with Jordin for her part thanking Whitney for her participation in the end. I won't lie. I baught this album without ever hearing it mainly to hear Whitney's last recorded music. I expected the music to be at the very least good and interesting. But I am extremely impressed with the entire set up. Cee Lo Green,Jordin Sparks and Goapele especially  all have the kind of vocally interpretive chops  to really make these passionate and superbly written songs to life. And with his new material added this album proves once and for all,for anyone who at this point is still uncertain that R.Kelly is destined to join the ranks of the iconic soul writer\/producers Curtis Mayfield,Stevie Wonder,Prince and Donny Hathaway as time goes on. One of the best contemporary soundtracks I've heard. And certainly one of the most soulful and funky.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Oh, bollocks! I know I'd come to the point with my reviews I'd HAVE to review this one also, so here it goes: \"Nevermind\" has been on practicly every TOP 100 Rock-album charts after it's release in 1991. And  when you listen to it through you will find out why. Kurt Cobain was not  the  straightest kind of lyrics-writer, and the meaning of his texts may  occasionally strike as hard-to-find. But still, despite the restlessness of  the lyrics, he managed to capture the feelings that teenagers were are  going through. But the importance of this album lays as much on the  catchy-but-clever melodies. Kurt Cobain's vocals match perfectly with the  music, Krist Novoselic's bass brings the deepness into their rage, and Dave  Grohl's pattering drums make the music sound you've being attacked by a  huge vawe of rock'n'roll noise. This album shows that Nirvana was equally  as taleted with the lighter, more sensitive tracks than with the  hardrockmonsters they becam famous from. So this album is by all means a  way more than just teh hit rack The Sm... oh, you know what!  actually, it  is not even the best track on the album. If you don't believe me, just  listen to Polly, Come As You Are of Something In The Way. Actually every  track on this album should be a rock'n'roll classic. Nirvana's success may  have got into a whole new levle after Cobain died, but it sure as hell  didn't originally cause from that. Just listen to this release and you'll  agree.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"When the members of Baroness were involved in a serious tour bus accident in 2012, it seemed like music would be the least of their concerns for a while. Though everyone walked away to live another day, it was less than a year later that the rhythm section of Allen Blickle (drums) and Matt Maggioni (bass) would walk away from the band altogether. But just as time heals all wounds, so too does music. The remaining core members, John Baizley (vocals, guitar) and Peter Adams (guitar, back-up vocals) vowed to carry on and in doing so, hunkered down with a new line-up of musicians to create a very personal comeback album.\n\nIn that spirit, \"Purple\" is indeed a re-birth for the band. While it still sounds unmistakingly Baroness-ish, there's a newfound sense of confidence and directness to the music that even the lofty heights of 2012's ambitious double album, \"Yellow & Green\" didn't quite capture, even if the band's full capabilities aren't fully explored. Truth be told, \"Purple\" sounds like the it belongs right in the middle of \"Blue\" (their transitionary record) and \"Yellow & Green\" (their real breakthrough), and that's not a bad place to be.\n\nInjecting a bit more ruggedness into his delivery than on the last album, Baizley is at his most passionate and urgent and thankfully, the band -- rounded out by newcomers Nick Jost (bass) and Sebastian Thomson (drums) -- are more than up to the task. The album opens with the blistering \"Morningstar,\" bringing the band back to its roots. With this sludgy and complex slab of heavy rock, the tone for the rest of the album is set. The pace keeps chugging along with the emotionally charged \"Shock Me,\" a strong contender for the most powerful rock single released this (past) year. From there it gets a little spacier, with \"Try To Disappear\" starting with some sparse electronics and vocals that sound as if they were recorded underwater before rushing to the surface mid-way to show off an explosive rhythm section. The weight of the album culminates in its closing number, \"If I Have to Wake Up (Would You Stop the Rain?),\" a haunting semi-ballad sums up the album and the band's experiences over the past three years in a nice and neat bow. With only nine proper tracks, \"Purple\" packs quite a wallop in such a short amount of time.\n\nThe part about \"Purple\" that may bruise the Baroness faithful is the fact that the album does little to push the band's evolution. It's really just a powerful re-affirmation and a slight return to form for those who may have felt they went off the deep end a little on their last album. To that end, it's certainly a satisfying listen even if it doesn't quite break new ground. The streamlined delivery (not to mention the running time clocking in at just over 40 minutes) makes it a powerful and potent experience all its own. Considering these guys could very well have quit music altogether after all they have experienced these last couple of years, it's a miracle that they are still standing and still sounding this good. Here's hoping they keep it just as colorful from here on out.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"When it comes down great guilty pleasure artists, we often seem to forget what influence they've made on music today, especially back in the 80's. For those acts, we always will think of Madonna, Michael Jackson and Prince. But, for Billy Joel, he really made the best that was still coming around. 35 years after he broke ground with Piano Man, he has still dominated with his music on the radio. While he hasn't recorded an album since 1993's River Of Dreams, his music still stands the test of time because it is worth while from beginning to end. But for those who seem more interested in acts like Britney Spears and anyone who has been on American Idol, and doesn't own a Billy Hoel record, than this is a start to download for your MP3 player.\n\nThe Essential Billy Joel is a collection of over 30 tracks from Billy's long and successful career from the 70's, 80's and 90's. The songs here have all been remastered well, and chronicle a innocent man who has made the music of our times. The collection includes a lot of great standards he has made his own for over 35 years like Piano Man, River Of Dreams, We Didn't Start The Fire, the delight diddy Uptown Girl, and The Longest Time, all the way to #1 hits like My Life, It's Still Rock N' Roll To Me and Allentown. There is so much that is great in music, but there are a few of his great songs that were sadly overlooked like You're Only Human (Second Wind), Modern Woman and a few other good songs. But, those are small complaints, because those songs were only minor hits. Instead, the collectin includes some of his songs from his 2001 classical pop album instead.\n\nAll in all, The Essential Billy Joel is a very strong and standard greatest hits album from beginning to end that is fun and a joy to listen to, whether you're a hard core fan, or anyone who is new to Billy Joel's songs. This album is definitely a great purchase to download off the internet, or buy from your local record store. Even though Billy Joel hasn't made anything new in awhile, his music is still making us go to extremes.\n\nSongs: B+\n\nPrice: B 1\/2+\n\nRemastering: A-\n\nOverall: B+","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Wow, it's been over 4 years since Mr. Zombie has graced us with an album. Let me start by saying that this album is not as bad or as weird as some people are saying it is. I've heard a lot of people saying things along the lines of this not sounding like Rob Zombie at all, or that it's not heavy, or that it sounds weird. Not true. Okay, if this album had come after \"Hellbilly Deluxe\", I'd probably be saying the same thing. But after \"The Sinister Urge\" was released, I knew he was headed in a different direction, and this album is not much different than that one. In fact, I'd say this album is more like Zombie's past works than the stuff that was heard on the \"House Of 1000 Corpses\" soundtrack or even the new songs from his greatest hits album that was released a couple years ago.\n\n\"Sawdust In The Blood\" is merely the album's intro, with pounding drums and creepy piano...sounds like the opening credits of a horror film. \"American Witch\" is a great song. It has typical heavy Zombie guitar and could pass for something from \"Sinister Urge.\" The next song, \"Foxy Foxy\" is the album's first single. It's not as heavy or angry, it sounds more like something you'd hear on one of Rob's remix albums. \"The Scorpion Sleeps\" is the only song on the album where I hear the influence of Rob's new guitarist, John 5. This guy played guitar for Marilyn Manson, and this track has a similar feel to past Manson songs like \"Rock Is Dead\" or \"Disposable Teens.\" Then there's \"Let It All Bleed Out\" which may be the heaviest on the album, and could probably pass for something from \"Hellbilly Deluxe\". Songs like \"Death Of It All\" has something I've never heard in a Zombie song before...acoustic guitar. It's a decent song and I'm glad to see Rob is exploring new territory. \"The Devil's Rejects\" and \"Lords Of Salem\" are your typical Zombie crunchers, both very good. I enjoyed every song on this album. My only complaint is that there isn't much new music...there's only 11 tracks, and since 2 of them are fillers, it's more like 9 new songs.\n\nBottom line: this album isn't as different or as bad as everyone has claimed. If you're a big Zombie fan, don't dismiss it based on what others have said or even on the album's first single. Give it a listen, I bet you'll like it.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"It took quite some time, but this song seems to have finally taken off. It's a good thing, too, as the success is well-earned. From the opening notes to the explosive chorus, Adele carries this song like it's the last one she will ever sing. The instrumentals never overtake her voice, and she sings with such passion that it's impossible to not feel her anguish. The lyrics are incredible, the vocals are spot-on, and the beat is perfect; this song lacks any glaring flaws, and as such deserves the number one spot on Billboard that it has earned.\n\nHopefully radio continues to play Adele; it would be nice to see 'Turning Tables', 'Rumour Has It', 'Someone Like You', and 'Set Fire to the Rain' get some major spins. There's enough material on the album to keep Adele on radio until her third effort drops; here's hoping they're able to get behind some real talent!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Two things for you hardcore MM fans reading this: I loved \"The Moon & Antarctica\" and I loved \"We Were Dead\" also (so keep that in mind).\n  \"Strangers to Ourselves\" is a great album, flat out.  While it may suffer from the one ailment a number of Modest Mouse albums suffer- it might be a track or two too long- it is a confident, swagger-filled, Brock eccentric joyride from start to finish.\n  Of course, the slowest track is the opening number, which possibly hints at an older Isaac Brock sounding older.  No chance.  \"Lampshades on Fire\" follows and brings along with it a little bit of everything you love about Modest Mouse, with confidence and swagger, only to be followed by  \"S*#t in Your Cut\", which could qualify as a deep cut on any pre-\"Good News\" album.\n  For those of you who also enjoyed the particular bouncy rock grooves of \"We Were Dead's\" second half, \"The Ground Walks\" and \"Be Brave\" bring a little of the that flavor to the mix (the latter sounding a little too close to that album's opening track).\n  And even though this is not the same sounding band that challenged and thrilled listeners more than fifteen years ago, it is still a band with Isaac Brock, so we get one minute rants like \"God is an Indian\", piano rockers like \"Sugar Boats\" (which sounds like it should be played in a western brothel), and the utterly odd \"Pistol\".  Subtitled \"(A Cunanan, Miami, Fl 1996)\" this electronically rhythm heavy tracks sounds like a Ween outtake with distorted vocals and subversive lyrics.  This is an odd track and coming fourth on the album, it helps define the eccentric yet fun character of this album.\n  If you have seen Modest Mouse live in the past several years, you will know that Brock is finally on his game.  He is performing with more confidence and seems to be having more fun.  \"Strangers to Ourselves\" is the work of a band having a good time doing what they do best.  Plus, it contains some of that irrresistibly funky brass a la \"King Rat\" and who doesn't need more of that?","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I've been a fan of Down for a long time and have all their studio albums. Their third one, \"Over the Under\", left me a little underwhelmed even though it was good so I was psyched when I saw this lying around the record store.\n\nThis EP has a HUGE Black Sabbath influence to it; the band still keep their trademark sound but they really prove that they can successfully try on something new and still sound just as good as ever. There aren't as many blistering guitar solos but there are a few here; the guitars are heavy as ever and still just as inventive. Some reviewers have said that Phil Anselmo's voice doesn't sound as good anymore. I beg to differ, it just sounds different from screaming his lungs out for years; just because it doesn't sound the exact same way it did with Pantera or on \"Nola\" doesn't mean the guy still can't pull it off (which he does well).\n\nI enjoyed this EP much more than \"Over the Under\" because it packed a punch, had clever songwriting twists and the band sounds like they have more life back in them now. This EP for me is like the first 3 Black Sabbath albums re-visited with a harder\/grittier edge and I mean that in the best way possible. I look forward to the EP's to follow this one.\n\nFor fans of Down or Pantera, don't expect Phil Anselmo's voice to be the same after years of screaming his brains out and also don't base your opinion of this EP on what previous Down albums sounded like. Give it a shot and I know that if you hear it unbiased, you'll like something on it (most likely the whole thing).\n\nFor fans new to Down, start with \"Nola\" or \"Down 2\" and work your way up to this.\n\nIf you're a big Black Sabbath fan, check out \"Witchtripper\", \"The Curse is a Lie\", and \"Misfortuneteller\" because it might peak your interest.","classification":5,"fold":1}

In a way he vocally reminds me of Miguel who made his mainstream debut with his single \"All I Want Is You\" featuring J. Cole in 2010. They both have that softer vocal approach. \"Remember Me\", Daley's debut single is actually the skipper here. It features the new pop artist Jessie J. The rest of the tracks are solid to great. My two favorites are \"Blame Game\" and \"Love Is A Losing Game (Acoustic)\" which is an Amy Winehouse song. He slows it down just a tad drawing the song out a little but it works. Vocals are fantastic on this track.\n\nThere are a lot of new artists coming from every which way these days but Daley stands out. Not necessarily genre-wise but vocally. I would love to see his career build and hope he doesn't become one of those celebrities in the tabloids for all the wrong reasons. :)\n\n4.3 stars.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"This much Dvorak for this small price? It's a no-brainer! Dvorak is a fantastic composer and is a personal favorite of mine. The recordings included here are of great quality - they may not be your favorite renditions of his works, but that's not the point of collections like this. Inexpensive large collections are either for people who are new to a composer or for collectors. Here you can get good recordings of a great composer, from his most popular (New World Symphony, Slavonic Dances) to the relatively unknown. I have my favorites of several of his symphonies, but I would never have been exposed to some of the deeper stuff on this album otherwise.\n\nWhat I love about this collection is that most (although not all) of what is included is complete. A couple of the pieces are not, which bothers me a bit - I like to hear a work in full - but overall the complete works that are here are WELL worth the $1.99. It's more than just an assorted \"best of\" like I've seen for some composers (Beethoven in particular) where they just take random sections of random works to create a hodgepodge of \"greatest hits.\" This is the next step: not a \"Complete Works\" collection but a solid collection of essential Dvorak that is perfect for all but the most avid Dvorak enthusiasts.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Bigger Bach Set\nIt's our first anniversary - and we're marking it with a Bigger Bach Set for you.  As has become our habit, we want to write to all of those music lovers who have turned to The Bach Guild in the past year and have purchased our Big Bach Sets. You've pushed every single release to #1 on the Classical charts and all of our Big Boxed Sets have reached the Top 5 on Amazon's Overall MP3 Albums chart. It's exciting to see Mozart, Vivaldi and Handel alongside Justin Timberlake and Michael Jackson's Thriller.\nOn to Bigger Bach Set - this is our first \"Part 2\" - we started on Bach's birthday last year with our crazy idea of 7 hours of Bach on his birthday for .99. The project spent one full week at #1 on the Overall Chart. We followed it the next week with a Haydn Symphonies collection, which also went to #1, and after that we couldn't look back. This collection does not repeat any of the music included in the first Big Bach Set. It's 14 hours of Bach, recorded from 1950 to the mid 1970s.\nOne overall word about the DNA of the Bach Guild and Vanguard: the Bigger Bach Set includes the most extensive single release of the Bach Guild recordings of Bach's cantatas yet released. Since the Bach Guild was founded in 1950 with the purpose of recording all of Bach's cantatas, that goal runs through the label, and through the branches of the tree of artists and engineers that the early founders of The Bach Guild worked with (sorry, let's say planted to maintain the metaphor). Seymour Solomon never came close to his goal of recording all of Bach's cantatas - but this goal was achieved by the European label that was started by the first Viennese employees of Vanguard, including Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Gustav Leonhardt.\nSo there's a great deal of pride in putting this release together - and we know that The Bach Guild's Bach recordings were always handled with great care and detail. So please enjoy - we don't require that you appreciate the artistry you get for our reasonable prices, but we appreciate the fact that many of you have mentioned the quality of the recordings in your reviews.\n1. We have tried to the best of our ability to offer the best quality files that are available. I know this fight over bitrates has continued to be a point for many of our listeners. However, there are simply some limits built into the Amazon downloading system that takes the entire decision out of our hands. However, we have extreme confidence in the sound quality of the original source material and we think you'll get an exceptional listening experience.\n2. That being said, a few of the cantatas included in this series were recorded in 1952\/1953 and are mono. Cantatas #122 and #133 are mono. We expect there might be some quibbling about the quality of these recordings - we include them here because they were world premiere recordings of these cantatas (in fact it would be 20 years before the second recording would appear).\n3. We like to sprinkle these boxes liberally with material that has been hard to find in any format - and if that's what you're looking for, you've certainly hit the jackpot with this collection. Where to start? Well, with a caveat - we released two collections last year, before the Big Boxed Sets became our main focus. They didn't get much attention (based on the sales) - but sharp eyed lovers of Bach could have found a significant playlist of Bach's cantatas, most of which are repeated here, and the Mogens Woldike conducted performance of the Passion According to St. Matthew. We're including them in this box - which should give them the attention these excellent recordings deserve.\n4. Easter Egg #1: Fans of Maureen Forrester will at last be treated to the return of her Bach recordings - again, which have been available in a very limited basis on CD, but are now receiving their digital download debut.\n5. Easter Egg #2: A special mention is due to James Friskin's Bach recordings. Released as three LPs, including a lovely 2 LP set entitled \"A Bach Recital\" in the mid 1950s, about half of these recordings were released on CD in 2004. They were badly remastered and the packaging incorrectly identified several of the works. Also, Friskin's own transcriptions were left off. We have righted those wrongs with this release, and even placed new \"index points\" between movements of the French Suites, which were not included on the CD release. James Friskin, for those unaware, was the head of the keyboard department at Juilliard School at the time these recordings were made, and he also has the distinction of being the first pianist to perform the complete Goldberg Variations live in concert in the United States. His recording of the Goldberg Variations is included here. Note: the first Big Bach Set did include Andras Schiff's recording of the Italian Concerto.\n6. Just to remain fair and transparent, we are repeating one work in this box that was included in an earlier release. The Big Baroque Box included the complete sonatas for violin and harpsichord that is also featured here, in its entirety. We did this because this release is very weighted toward Bach's vocal music, and we wanted to include some non-vocal music. Rather than include another (albeit unreleased) performance of the Brandenburgs (which there are three in the Bach Guild catalog), which we felt would be dishonest to those who purchased the first Big Bach Set, we are including a work not included in the first release.\nThank you again for all your reviews (good and bad) - and our next release will be available soon, and it will be devoted to the music of Franz Josef Haydn. In the meantime - those of you who want to get caught up on the Big Box Sets that you've missed, Amazon's planning a big surprise some time VERY VERY soon. Keep your eye on your email box, your twitter account, The Bach Guild Facebook page and our web site! You won't be disappointed!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Once again, Steven Wilson twiddles the knobs on this, the sixth album from the amazing prog rock group Yes. I can really only report on the audio CDs, as my bluray surround system has to be replaced. Wilson's remix of TFTO is very crisp and clear, and all of the instruments and voices stand out much better than they once did on vinyl and in the primative days of when the compact disc was brand new. The Rhino\/Elektra remasters were a step up from the previous issues, and included run through versions of THE REVEALING SCIENCE OF GOD and THE ANCIENT, with slightly differet\/unfinished lyrics and a few alternate arrangements. These tracks were retitled DANCE OF THE DAWN and GIANTS UNDER THE SUN. (which are the subtitles of REVEALING and ANCIENT). Wilson's version includes similar bonus tracks, however, the lyrics and music are more loke the final masters. The remaining bonus tracks are Wilson's imaginary single edits of all 4 songs, with the RITUAL edit done in two parts. Of course, no single was ever released from TALES. Yes had finally stumped the executives at Atlantic Records. The original album consists of four movements, averaging 20 minutes each, taking up four sides of a two record album set. For those who already know and love TALES, this is either in your home or on your wish list. And if Santa didn't come up with the goods, go get it. But keep your Rhino versions for the studio runthroughs with the muffed up lyrics, and the LOUD arrangement of the LEAVES OF GREEN section of THE ANCIENT. Wilson's is the highest quality version yet. I can only imagine how the 5.1 mix sounds. If it's anything like the FRAGILE and RELAYER mixes in 5.1 that Wilson created, they are going to blow every Yes fan away!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Sure, Peter Noone was a safe teenybopper idol and the Hermits weren't frequently used in the studio, but what a great string of lightweight pop singles they left behind in the wake of the second wave of the British  Invasion.\nGranted, this stuff isn't quantum physics, but songs like  \"Im Into Something Good,\" \"Silhouettes\" and \"Mrs.  Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter\" were infectious ear candy for  those of us who were barely in our teens in the mid-sixties.  One of the  first six albums I bought (I now have over 6,000) was Introducing Herman's  Hermits with the three previously mentioned singles on it.  It also  contained a lot of covers like \"Sea Cruise\" and \"I  Understand,\" but this was a singles band which is what makes this such  a terrific collection.  The only singles missing are their last two to  chart in the U.S.--\"Don't Go Out  Into the Rain (You're Going To  Melt)\" and \"Museum,\" both from 1967. Instead we're given a  handful of failed singles from 1968 to their breakup in 1970, although  several of them hit the top ten in the UK: \"Sunshine Girl\" (#8),  \"Something's Happening\" (#6), \"My Sentimental Friend\"  (#2) and \"Years May Come, Years May Go\" (#7).  Since this is,  after all, a UK release it only makes sense that these songs--though  unfamiliar to the average American listener--are included in this Best Of  package.  [Note: No. 1 songs like \"Mrs. Brown\" and \"I'm  Henry VIII, I Am\" are on this set, too, even though they were never  released in the UK as singles.  So this collection seems to be a compromise  for fans on both sides of the Atlantic.]\nIn any case, this is a wonderful  collection of sixties pop confection.  So, listen people, this is a dandy  and not a must to avoid. [Ouch!]","classification":4,"fold":1}

While the lyrics don't mean all that much, it adds up the eccentricness of the album, making it more fun with each listen. About the only other flaw with this album is that Lee Ranaldo doesn't sing on any tracks on this album.\n\"Bull in the Heather\" is a classic, as is its video with that Le Tigre girl cameoed in it. Kim has an excellent voice on it, as well as it being loved among the fans. The outro part sounds real cool.\nOpener \"Winner's Blues\" is a real nice track, as it's an acoustic-like track, a brilliant track on this album.\nI just love \"In the Mind of the Bourgeois Reader\". It's a punk-like track here, probably the fastest one, and Thurston sounds as if he's having a lot of fun during the recording of it. Then it goes into \"Sweet Shine\" the only song with any real length on the album. It's a great love song.\nShe has some pretty interesting tracks as well. Her style overall has a sexy sound to it. \"Bone\" is very awesome, I love the energy of the drums on it, then the chords are well-progressed. It's just a real memorable one on this album. She sings 7 of the 14 songs.\n'Experiental Jet Set, Trash and No Star' is something that really shines on track 12 \"Tokyo Eye\", a very noisy song. It's very awesome to listen to either in the car or on your stereo.\nThis one's good for introducing people to SY. I got this January of this year, and I think it's excellent. There are some flaws, but overall, I think it's pretty good. The songs are very short, which helps, 'cuz it doesn't really contain enough epic stuff. So yeah, I am recommending it here.

{"text":"It took nine years for Huey Lewis and The News to move from \"Plan B\" to \"Soulsville,\" and it's time to travel back in time. if you recall, this is The News second stroll down a full disc of memory lane. In 1994, the band issued \"Four Chords and Several Years Ago,\" an attempt at tipping their collective hat to the band's R'n'B influences. This time they go a step further and head to the legendary Stax studios to get a little of that authentic Stax groove, horns and female singers intact. (Think Cris Isaak's trip to Sun Studios for \"Beyond The Sun.\")\n\nFor the most part, they pull it off by pulling at plenty of the obvious picks. Solomon Burke would have been an easy choice to pluck from, but the band goes for a more obscure single \"Get You Off Of My Mind\" (which was a number one R'n'B single, but barely cracked the top 40. It was easier to cover \"Cry to Me,\" ala the Rolling Stones, or \"Tonight's The Night.\" Same with Joe Tex's \"I Want to Do Everything for You.\" Lewis has always been an erstwhile soul singer, even in his pop days, so the materiel suits him. In fact, the only blunder is covering \"Respect Yourself,\" already done to death by the likes of Bruce Willis. It's like o;d friends together for a good night of jamming.\n\nThe only thing that bums me out is that Huey and The News have not issued a new CD for almost a decade of fresh material. Given that he hasn't done so since \"Hard at Play\" (1991) prior to \"Plan B,\" it would be nice to see what kind of song-stash they've built up.

{"text":"This Vaccines was a big album in the eyes of many a few years ago.  Let's listen to it.\n\n\"Wreckin' Bar\" is a nice anthemic punk song.  Well it sure sounds like it's in the punk spirit.  Whether it's technically punk or not I haven't a clue!  It's catchy enough.  \"If You Wanna\" has equally aggressive drumming and a pounding rhythm.  It's really catchy and enjoyable.  \"But if you wanna come back it's alright it's alright, it's alright if you wanna come back!\"  That's actually  not the best part- the verse melody is the thing I mostly like about this tune.  \"Well I don't want to wake up in the morning but I've got to face the day, that's what all the friends I do not like as much as you say!\"\n\n\"A Lack of Understanding\" has an excellent verse melody.  Really familiar too.  The chorus is pretty good \"I've got too much time on my hands, but you don't understand or you won't understand\".  \"Blow It Up\" is fairly forgettable since the vocals get wishy washy, but there's enough melody taking place to make it pretty good.  \"Wetsuit\" opens with hymn-like vocals.  The singer reminds me of the guy from Coldplay here.  The \"ah ah ah\" sounds like the 60's song by Dusty Springfield \"I Only Want to Be With You\".  Pretty decent melody either way.  \"You want to do things differently, you'll do them independently\".  I love the part \"Put a wetsuit on, come on come on, grow you hair out long come on, put a t-shirt on do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong!\"\n\n\"Norgaard\" is fast-paced memorable anthem rock.  \"Her mind's made up she don't want to go steady she's only seventeen so she's probably not ready!\" is a funny line.  \"Post Break-Up Sex\" is another memorable rocker.  \"Leave it 'til the guilt consumes, I found you in the nearest room, all our friends were unaware, most had just passed out downstairs\"  is a good lyric.  This song carries the same rhythm and melody the whole way through but it's a good one.  This band has a lot of talent because not just anyone can write a song like this and make it memorable.  Top notch songwriting puts this song in a higher category than most commercial-sounding bands who write music like this.  \"Post break up sex that helps you forget your ex, what did you expect from post break up sex?\"  VERY clever lyrics!\n\n\"Under Your Thumb\" is pretty decent pop\/rock.  \"I don't mind about taking it slow, I'm perfectly aware of what I'm yet to know, mutually assumed utterly consumed, totally adored, Eleanor!\"  A quieter song but still pretty good.  Love the \"Eleanor\" part in particular.  \"All In White\" opens predictably with the chugging bass similar to so many alternative rock bands nowadays, but these guys... well they know how to make it better than most due to strong vocal melody talents.  The melody starts out quiet but picks up the second time around when the guitars comes in.  Really good song, and the lead singer proves he can sing honest melodies.  The way he carries out certain words contains a lot of feeling.\n\n\"Wolf Pack\" is perhaps the only song I'm not fond of.  It has a fast-moving pace but it feels like it's missing a strong enough melody to really grab me.  \"Family Friend\" is a relaxing tune with a much better melody.  Really good lyrics too. \"You wanna get young but you're just getting older, and you had a fun summer but it's suddenly colder, if you want a bit of love put your head on my shoulder it's cool\"  Also love the line afterwards \"Half baked girl hey I'm hardly surprised, snake eyes disguise everybody's lies, faded nail marks on pale thighs and an awkward secret that someone denies, and now you're trying to get yourself back in, come on in\".\n\nThe hidden track, \"Somebody Else's Child\" is a short piano ballad of sorts.  I like how the piano gallops at times.  Touching moment of the album and drastically different from the faster punk\/pop rock stuff.  This album deserves credit for the tight songwriting and strong lyrics.  It's a 5-star album alright.","classification":5,"fold":1}

However, in many ways, the band they most resemble is the grunge group 'Mudhoney' - I guess it's something in their delivery, singer Taime Downe has more of a punk delivery than a hard rock one. While acts like Warrant, Extreme and Winger champion their technical virtuoso, these guys play with a carefree, reckless abandon; much like Mudhoney.\n\nBut there is no point in over-analysing a band called 'Faster Pussycat' - they're a bit of fun, don't take themselves seriously.

On the other hand you'll also find him stating that \"the internet is OVER\" for him so it's without a doubt that some of his new music will be very easy to find. These are actually similar moves to ones he made on a number of occasions when his music and career seemed in question. Well right now his career isn't in that state at all. He's musically revered by many in this generation and was recently given a tribute on the BET Music Awards this past year. Prince himself also seems to obsessed with some strange form of eternal youth in which his music doesn't age but his lyrical themes mature. You will not find any explicit lyrics on this album for sure,same as you won't find them on any of his albums since 2001. That doesn't mean that effects the music at all because these are the most energized,lively,funky and musicially sophisticated songs Prince has done in the new millenium. The album opens and ends on the same basic musical note with \"Compassion\" and \"Everybody Loves Me\" embracing the shuffling LINN drum led rockabilly styled funk with lyrics that alternately speak of both selflessness and selfishness. \"Beginning Endlessly\",the amazing \"Sticky Like Glue\" and \"Lavaux\" all embrace the classic Prince all encompassing funk groove with some delicious synthesizer squiggles and layored drum and percussion tracks. He hasn't lost his touch as a multi instrumentalist in the least bit and actually has expanded on it to include light rhythmic nods to both hip-hop\/R&B and contemporary 80's dance revival (itself based on his own original music) without shamelessly surrenduring to either style and still being himself. Songs like \"Future Love Song\",\"Walk In The Sand\" and \"Sea Of Everything\" also embrace Prince's touch with the slow jam to it's absolute best effect. Typical of Prince he makes you flip through 75 seperate 2-4 second empty tracks before we get to cut 77,which is the title song offered as a very hidden bonus selection. This is very much a TAFKAP era sounding funk\/rap styled number but still his one-man-band style is very much in attendence. After all these years Prince obviously has no intent on being a fossil. He wants to keep being himself and now that he's in his 50's he also refuses to musically look down on those younger than them and also embraces many of their ideas into his own.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Although I was familiar with  the GD from hearing a song or two on the radio, \"Mars Hotel\" was the first Dead album that I ever heard all the way through. I was about 14 years old at the time. Of all people, it was my dentist who played this for me. He had a nice stereo and he'd often play music for his patients. He asked me if I minded listening to the Grateful Dead. I said \"Go ahead. They're okay.\" The nitrous oxide brought me to dreamland, and the Dead made my dental appointment more fun than I expected it would be. Every song on the album has since become a Grateful Dead classic. Some of their best songs are here. \"Scarlet Begonias\", \"U.S. Blues\", \"China Doll\", Unbroken Chain\".\"Ship Of Fools\" among them. And the newest edition of this CD includes bonus tracks featuring a smokin' live version of \"Scarlet Begonias\", a live not yet completely worked out version of \"U.S. Blues\" with the title \"Wave That Flag\". My personal favorite bonus tracks here are the 2 solo demos by Phil Lesh. Phil strums his way through \"Pride Of Cucumonga\" and \"Unbroken Chain\" on an acoustic guitar occasionally revealing chord changes to his band mates. This is one of the albums that puts to rest the ugly rumor that the Dead were terrible in the studio. Buy two copies of this.

{"text":"Q-Tip's solo career reads like a bad joke. As A Tribe Called Quest's frontman, he led the alternative hip hop movement and helped establish hip hop as a literate and creative art form during the 90s. After the Native Tongues moved on and ATCQ disbanded, Tip released his solo debut&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Amplified\/dp\/B00002R0K9\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Amplified<\/a>&nbsp;in 1999 and looked forward to a career of production and performing as his abstract genius and legend would warrant. And after ten years, at least three inexplicably shelved LPs (most notably \"Kamaal the Abstract,\" which got as far as promo pressings), and countless record labels, Tip's long awaited follow-up \"The Renaissance\" arrived almost silently. Release delays date back years, and since rumors of \"The Renaissance\" have floated for so long, the quick and quiet release seems odd, especially given his huge fanbase and genre-defying appeal.\n\nAt 43 minutes and twelve tracks, it's a concise and focused listen and is immediately enjoyable. While it emits a spirit somewhat comparable to a Tribe recording and shows a hint of the smooth Soulquarians vibe of the late-90s, I'd say it's most similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Amplified\/dp\/B00002R0K9\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Amplified<\/a>. However,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Amplified\/dp\/B00002R0K9\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Amplified<\/a>'s most frequent criticism is that it is too forced and pop-oriented, and \"The Renaissance\" does not have that problem. The music is comparably playful, upbeat, and bouncy, but is less poppy and more mature and soulful than its predecessor. The production, mostly piano-based, is layered with a range of artistic instrumentation that sounds classy despite its fun and appealing nature. It's a very clean and consistent sound, and transitions are so fluid that the first half seems like variations upon a single idea.\n\nTip still has the charm and wit of the wily teen from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/People-s-Instinctive-Travels-and-the-Paths-of-Rhythm\/dp\/B0000004WA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm<\/a>, but his focus has shifted with time and maturity. He's happier to drop a clever one-liner or a latently insightful verse than elaborate upon social ills as he did in the 90s. He doesn't often display the style that led to his \"abstract rapper\" tag; instead his lyrics concern different manners of love, music, and levels of inspiration. The hooks are strong and his approach is well-rounded, seemingly intent upon the combined quality of the music and rap. No guest MCs appear, but vocal contributors include Raphael Saadiq, D'Angelo, Norah Jones, and Amanda Diva.\n\nThe disc opens to the pleasant, bouncy guitar strums of \"Johnny Is Dead,\" which give way to an appealing arrangement with rumbling bass and piano chords and a strong performance from Tip. The breezy \"Gettin' Up\" and \"Official\" are similar in approach, structure, and sound to the opener and achieve the same appeal as well. \"We Fight\/Love\" is an excellent collaboration with a particularly airy Raphael Saadiq, who complements Tip nicely over a great arrangement. Another highlight is the hidden title track after \"Move,\" which has a hypnotic beat and the album's most insightful lyrics. \"Dance on Glass\" picks up when the rich beat finally kicks in about a minute through, and the Norah Jones duet \"Life Is Better\" is smooth, inspired excellence. \"Won't Trade\" is clever, and \"You\" is a decent love song that sounds good but moves too slowly. However, \"Believe\" with D'Angelo is wonderful musically and lyrically, and the closer \"Shaka\" is the track that most resembles a classic Tribe cut.\n\n\"The Renaissance\" is not the revolutionary opus that some might expect from Tip after such a long layover, but as Dr. Dre should soon learn, hype builds around years of delays. The music is totally enjoyable and well-produced even if not totally uncharted (granted, some of these tracks are years old), and the LP reminds me why I had so eagerly anticipated Q-Tip's return a few years ago. This album is a great listen and should not disappoint.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Straight No Chaser always impresses me with their incredible ability to deliver a cappella renditions of classic songs and ballads--they put their own stamp on them with their remarkable harmonizing and the members of the group never miss a beat! They possess a keen sense of timing, excellent diction and sophisticated phrasing that invariably leaves me wanting more--and this CD is no exception!\n\nThere aren't too many tracks on this album which is a follow-up (Volume 2) of \"Six Pack;\" but everything we get here is top notch, high quality control singing and performing all the way through. \"Get Ready\" is quite dynamic and Straight No Chaser performs this with lots of energy right from their hearts and souls. It all works well, too--I love the sounds of their version of this song! \"Like a Prayer,\" a song I first heard by Madonna, gets the royal treatment from Straight No Chaser and I really like this number. Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\" (mixed with \"Poison\") shows their ability to do a two song medley with panache and listen for yet another gem of a two song medley with \"Rhythm of Love\/Can't Help Falling in Love.\" \"Buddy Holly\" is most impressive and the album ends strong with \"Let's Get It On.\" Awesome!\n\nStraight No Chaser again proves they have the vocal chops to remain a fine a cappella group for however long they wish to be performing together--and hopefully for us that will be many years to come!

{"text":"I have always loved George Michael musically, because he has been one of the most soulful singers I have ever enjoyed at the soul of the voice within. Which is something many of today's singers do not have and neither they will try. Hard to believe that it has been 35 years since he made his debut as a part of Wham, and his world really changed. But he has done so many remarkable covers over the years. He showed that throughout his career on his own by covering artists from Bonnie Raitt to Terence Trent D'Arby a few years ago for with Let Her Down Easy for his Symphonica album. But he has covered Stevie Wonder for years for so many of his albums and b-sides. His rendition of As with Mary J. Blige is one of those underrated covers that is really a hidden gem of George's. The song actually was a U.K. exclusive for his 1998 hits compilation, Ladies & Gentleman: The Best Of George Michael. The song is definitely a lovely song to listen to, and definitely worth every note. He really showed that he and Mary really do have a lot of chemistry worth listening to. It really was never recognized in America by die hard George Michael fans, as was the case with Outside back in 1998, but honestly the song definitely is joyous and very soulful. If you have loved George's duets over the years like Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me with Elton John, than you'll absolutely love this song.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Though their horn-heavy charts and funky soul had it precursors (Sly & The Family Stone, BS&T, etc.), few had taken it so far, and with such heavy grooves as this Berkeley\/Oakland ensemble.  This debut album,  originally issued on Bill Graham's small San Francisco label, and out of  print for many years, nailed it all on the first try. The songs are  eminently catchy, the rhythms (especially Dave Garibaldi's drumming) are as  vital as heartbeats, and the horn charts blew away their contemporaries.  The vocals, always a moving target with T.O.P. came from Richard Thomas and  Rufus Miller. Many fans like their next two or three LPs better, as the  arrangements became more refined and the band tightened up a bit, but as  the founding document of funk city, I'll vote this one every time. The perfect soundtrack for wolfing down a messy plate of ribs from KC's.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"The Track List\n\nThis review is for the COMPLETE score, which is currently not available ANYWHERE to my knowledge, but is the ideal way to hear this score (naturally). For reference, after seeing the film in the theater twice, I believe the correct chronological order of the music to be:\n\nOverture\nThe Grid\nFather and Son\nThe Son of Flynn\nEncom Part I\nEncom Part II\nRecognizer\nArmory\nArena\nRound One\nRinzler\nThe Game Has Changed\nOutlands\nFather and Son\nAdagio For Tron\nNocturne\nOutlands, Part II\nReflections\nEnd Of Line\nCastor\nDerezzed\nFall\nSea of Simulation\nRectifier\nDisc Wars\nC.L.U.\nArrival\nFlynn Lives\nSunrise Prelude\nTron Legacy (End Titles)\nSolar Sailer\nFinale\n\nThe Pieces\n\nOverture is a mix of electronic and orchestra, and is not used in the film. It is the main theme of the film which is used many times and is a perfect overture.\n\nThe Grid is very similar to Overture, but features a build-up and voice-over by Jeff Bridges. Normally I don't care for voice-overs...but this one is awesome.\n\nFather and Son is a slower version of the main main theme. Beautiful.\n\nThe Son of Flynn is an electronic piece that sounds more like a Daft Punk song, building upon its own electronic themes. Great.\n\nEncom Part I and II are atmospheric film music which are uniformly excellent and a nice break after the faster paced The Son of Flynn.\n\nRecognizer is the awesome music you remember from the Tron Legacy Trailer, a sinister foreboding piece that gradually builds upon itself to become an epic awesome musical masterpiece evoking appropriate awe and wonder of the first glimpse of a world only previously imagined.\n\nArmory is a slow down-beat piece played while Sam is being suited up to fight in the games, it's one of my favorite tracks. Slow, methodical, and beautiful.\n\nArena, Round One, and Rinzler are all battle music from the games and to me are similar in feel. They are more brash, harsh, loud, and lively than more of the other tracks, featuring a lot of digital distortion. Still good though.\n\nThe Game Has Changed is another one of the best tracks, featured during the light-cycle battle. Show-down music. Great stuff.\n\nOutlands Part I and II is atmospheric music to evoke the landscape of the digital world, and is similar to something John Williams or James Newton Howard would use in Hook or Peter Pan. Another of my favorites, though both pieces are very similar, almost to the point of being one piece.\n\nAdagio For Tron is slow piece that builds in in sad gravity like Chopin piece, as it describes Flynn's creation of the new Grid, and how it was then corrupted and filled with tragedy by his creation C.L.U.\n\nNocturne is another of my favorites, mostly because it reminds me of Nightvision from Discovery. It's slow, sad, and sweet. I love it.\n\nReflections is basically the start of the theme from C.L.U., and thus is part of the theme of that character. Dark and sinister starting with strings and then moving into electronic sounds.\n\nEnd of Line, Castor, and Derezzed are all club music from the End of Line club. The first is industrial sounding, the second is more rave-type club music (more upbeat, with a cut-out seconds after it starts). Derezzed is arguably the best \"Daft-Punk style\" track on the score, with infectious beats and addictive electronic stylings that will make you want to listen to it over and over. A perfect piece of music for a stylized fight. Fantastic.\n\nFall is an appropriate piece of music played during a quick crisis in the film, a piece that gets the heart rate up quick. I don't care for the electronic distortion on this track as it distracts from the main musical theme played.\n\nSea of Simulation is another slower paced piece that sounds very Daft-Punkish in tone. Soothing and slow, it's the music from the journey on the solar sailor. Another favorite.\n\nRectifier. Sinister villain music of threatening imminent demise. CodeMaster Talon told me it reminds her of Captain Hook's Theme from Hook. Appropriate music. A good track if you like Zaibach from the Vision of Escaflowne soundtrack or One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII.\n\nDisc Wars is a piece full of determination which builds on itself. Less brash than the arena battle music, it is nonetheless appropriate battle music. Excellent.\n\nC.L.U. is naturally the villains' main theme and an excellent sweeping sinister piece which builds upon itself going from sinister to contemplative to urgent, blending the best of Reflections and Fall. Outstanding.\n\nArrival is your brief breather before the epic finale. It's the music played when our heroes finally arrive at their destination and there is a spiritual tint to the piece as it goes from light and angelic to heavy and mortal. Gates of Valhalla music. Brilliant.\n\nFlynn Lives is by far the best piece of music in the entire score. It is the epic climax music which uses Wagnerian string and horn motifs for brilliant dramatic effect. This piece literally makes the final showdown of the movie what it is. There are no words to describe how brilliant and awesome this piece is. Academy Award material if I ever heard it. The main Tron Legacy theme is used to its maximum potential.\n\nSunrise Prelude is....gorgeous. It combines the slow beautiful beats of the style of Encom, Armory, or Nocturne with the slow orchestral beauty that comes later from the finale. It's the last track in the movie and being at once sad, dramatic, romantic, and achingly beautiful... is absolutely perfect.\n\nTron Legacy (End Titles) is perfect ending credits music. It's an electronic, upbeat, catchy, fantastic remix of the main Tron Legacy Theme from Overture, The Grid, ect.\n\nSolar Sailer is another slower paced electronic piece similar to Sea of Simulation (and goes quite well together with it). Not my favorite track as it's just not progressive enough in its melody for my taste, but it's a favorite track for many people (including my girlfriend).\n\nFinale is the Sunrise Prelude (only orchestra with no electronic sounds) which morphs into the main Tron Legacy theme with carefully chosen electronic instrumentation. After a somewhat rousing main theme is quietly takes its leave like the last star of night under the light of day. An wonderful finale to a fantastic score.\n\nThe Score\n\nTron Legacy has one of the greatest musical scores in film history, easily on par with the best of John Williams, James Horner, and perhaps even the revered Ennio Morricone. It's THAT good. And this coming from me, a person who pretty much only listens to video game music, J-pop, and most of all, TONS of orchestral scores for TV shows and films (you would think Silva Screen Records is on speed-dial and City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra as my homepage for all the music I have from everything from El Cid to The Last Starfighter).\n\nThe first Tron had a very unique musical score that was largely made-up of electronic sounds, resulting a very appropriate computerized feel. When I heard that Daft Punk would be creating the score for Tron Legacy, I didn't know WHAT to think. On the one hand, I was a huge fan of Daft Punk's album discovery (check out my spotlight review on Amazon if you don't believe me). And on the other hand...there was just so much potential to get everything wrong and ruin the score by producing something that didn't fit with the vibe of the new film and the original. Hence, I tried to keep an open mind and not set my expectations too high so as not to be disappointed. I needn't have worried.\n\nSome have said that the score needs to stand on its own, and is best heard separate from the film. I couldn't disagree more. A ballet is meant to be watched, an opera is meant to be watched, and a film score is meant to be watched. When you see the film Tron Legacy the music fuels everything on-screen. The film was actually cut to the music, resulting the movie feeling very much like an awesome long music video. From the opening notes and title of the film to the epic climax at its finish, I highly recommend seeing the film to fully enjoy the music. That said...\n\nThis score manages to perfectly capture the feel of the world of Tron, simultaneously paying tribute to the past while being completely fresh and new (I have heard the score to the original Tron and could not find any copied musical cues whatsoever). Rest assured, the themes in this score are brand new, yet totally appropriate. Sometimes the music is completely electronic, sometimes it is completely orchestral, many times it is a mixture of both, but it is always excellent.\n\nToo Many Adagios?\n\nIt appears that most of the negative reviews of this score are from people who were expecting another Daft Punk album. In case you haven't guessed it yet, this is not an album like Discovery. Not even close. There are no words to any of the songs, and they were designed for a film, not a dance club. While some of the tracks certainly are brilliant in a very similar way to Daft Punk's past work (Derezzed and other tracks like End of Line and Castor), primarily this score succeeds as what it was designed to be. A film score.\n\nSome have commented that the score to Tron Legacy is similar to other scores, and this is true. It may at times remind you of Mass Effect (with its heavy synthesizer use) or Inception (with its heavy two-tone use) but that is very unfair. This score blows Inception's score out of the water in every way. I had thought Inception had the best score of the year until I saw Tron Legacy, but it feel incredibly repetitive and unimaginative in comparison. And Mass Effects themes are not nearly as dynamic, full, or original in comparison (the tracks on Mass Effect are also very short).\n\nFlynn Lives, And So Does Daft Punk's Greatest Achievement\n\nWhen I heard the track Flynn lives I thought of the finale to an Ennio Morricone score like The Good The Bad And The Ugly where a soaring vocal would not be inappropriate. The main theme is simply that strong, that beautiful, that good. Honestly, this score belongs with the best of the best, and deserves to be listened to along with the best of great film composers of the last 30 years (Williams, Silvestri, Powell, Horner, Goldsmith).\n\nIt would be absolutely criminal if this score does not win an Academy Award. If you are a fan of film music you owe it to yourself to purchase the score immediately. Just be sure you get the complete score and listen to it in the proper order, and see the film at least once to experience the music the way it was meant to be.\n\nSpecial note on the LP edition of the score:\n\nThis is the most complete version of the score available to my knowledge. While the tracks are not in chronological order, there is only one track missing. Ironically it is one of my favorite tracks and the one I listen to the most, Father and Son. This is especially irritating as this is a Disney album and Disney and Apple are very close partners, yet this is an iTunes exclusive track. Its absence is absolutely idiotic in this otherwise complete album.\n\nAlso, the beautiful album notes on a sheet of paper inside of the album rather than on the record sleeves, and there is no digital download or other extras included with this LP.\n\nMusically, the LP version of this album is practically identical to the MP3\/CD release versions, however the digital and orchestral parts of the soundtrack blend together slightly better (the digital sounds are less sharp), and the bass is greatly reduced. The bass from the MP3 shakes the foundations when I play the Overture, but is nearly unnoticeable on the LP. I own both and consider both an essential purchase.","classification":5,"fold":1}
{"text":"This mp3 sounds great so my complaint is not about sound quality. However, this song is usually presented as a pairing 'This Beat Goes On\/Slippin' To Glide' and it usually happens in a seemless manner. These songs are cult classics and I'm sure the fans out there would love these to be presented in the normal seemless manner. To me it seems like breaking them in two is just a ploy to generate extra revenue. Still, I'm sure fans would pay $2 to have this be one peerless piece of music. I will compare this this to ZZ Top's 'Waitin' The Bus\/Jesus Left Chicago' or Queen's 'We Will Rock You\/We Are The Champions' - you really shouldn't hear one without the other.","classification":1,"fold":1}

{"text":"Wonderful by Eric Clapton is a heartfelt classic love rock song that covers what it feels like to be with someone who sees the inner and outer beauty of you.  Yes, I understand that the singer is actually singing about his love interest who turns many heads at the party they attend.  However, I think that it can also be  a positive love song about two people who are in a relationship together who also keep on the rose-colored glasses (metaphorically speaking) even after they have been together for a long time.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":1}

I first heard it years ago on local FM, after hearing Black Hole Sun many times (too sludgy for my tastes--and now the erstwhile \"grunge\"\nafficianados will be shooting arrows wrapped in burning flannel soaked in Starbucks at my house--that opinion permanently\nreversed  by hearing Burden In My Hand for the first time). Long sentence. I apologize. How do I describer this?\nI'm told, or heard, that the audience, on hearing Beethoven's Fifth for the first time was stunned to silence--a what\nthe h--- was that? moment. Beethoven's fifth this tune ain't, but after a lot of years, it still surprises, and surprise invokes memory and what is memorable is what makes music last. Don't know about the future of this tune, but it popped back into my head the other day, so I bought it. Up close, no airwaves between us, it still moves. Cornell's (sic?) voice, working like an engine way over its red line sits on top of some really fine musicianship. Which is, first, what brings any band or singer into my\nrange of attention, the skill of the people involved at the craft they've chosen. And it ain't easy, folks.

Kanye West hasn't been musically better with his frills, from marrying Kim Kardashian, to making his stage antics on Taylor Swift and recently Beck on his Grammy-Winning Album Of The Year. Now, for the two of them to team up with Paul McCartney, the question is have they have better in their art, well the answer is absolutely no. Kanye showed it badly on Only One, now with FourFive Seconds, the two of them do not ignite in the heart, instead they have shown to be a whimper of themselves in voice, and in chemistry with Sir Paul. Overall, I wasn't even impressed with the song, and honestly much worse than what the two of them have done in songs before. If you are a die hard Paul McCartney fan, I would sincerely pass this one up, because four and five seconds, feels more like wasted time overall.\n\nSong: F","classification":1,"fold":1}

{"text":"One of the things I always loved about Pink Floyd was how far ahead of its time they were. Other than the signature organs and dated sound effects, both DSOTM and The Wall were so advanced that they still sound relatively modern. Fast forward a couple of decades: Syd Barrett passes away in 2006. Richard Wright passes away in 2008. Pink Floyd releases The Endless River in 2014 with little fanfare before immediately retiring the brand. David Gilmour releases Rattle That Lock in 2015, probably signifying the last solo effort from the legendary guitar player. So what ever became of Roger Waters?\n\nPink Floyd is my band, but Rogers Amused to Death remains (IMO) the greatest album written by anyone ever. Ever. Released in 1992, Mr. Waters once again redefined the musical landscape in an industry watered down by pop singles, grunge, hip-hop and the emergence of nu-metal. The problem is no one heard it. Pink Floyd has never been about the members that made it up, so no one knew to look up Rogers solo masterpiece. So the question 25 years later became: will anyone listen to Rogers Is This The Life We Really Want?\n\nRoger never disappoints. I EXPECT deep lyrics. I EXPECT to be surprised, but what I didn't EXPECT was to take a trip back to 1977 and the Floyds Animals era. One of the things I always loved about Pink Floyd was how far ahead of its time they were, but Roger has reversed the clock and released an album in 2017 that sounds like its forty years old. Its twelve tracks that transcend the decades that haunted Rogers never-ending disdain for war and the sorrow he never recovered from over losing a father he never really knew. With bits and pieces from every Floyd record beginning with Piper At the Gates of Dawn through The Final Cut and similar to the authentic theme Gilmour\/Mason\/Wright restored with The Endless River, Roger Waters has written an album that travels BACK in time while remaining relevant with todays themes.\n\nI honestly felt my expectations could never be met given the high bar set with Amused To Death, but theres a reason why Roger\/Dave\/Syd\/Nick\/Rick were and ARE the best there ever will be. Ill let you judge each track on your own. If you're a true Floyd Freak as I am, you will get teary-eyed as you are given one last ride through the childhoods end of the London Underground from 1967.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I was never a huge fan of Newsteds bass playing, but then again who can compare to Cliff. I do know he always had a better growl than Hetfield ever did, which was pretty cool. This band is basically some old classic sounding heavy Motorhead sounding rock\/metal style music. NOT THRASH, so don't go into it thinking that's what you'll get. It's Jason's own brand of music. He's not a great lyric writer, some are actually cheesy, but i give him credit because he hasn't had years and years of experience like most lyric writers. Not sure how much he \"wrote\" for Flotsam, but they are much better than anything Flotsams lead singer can come up with. So it's a good start, only four songs really isn't enough to tell if he has a \"future\" with it or not. Personally i would love to see him start a real \"thrash\" band. Just play bass, and have another singer. But that's just my opinion. Good stuff. Nothing groundbreaking. Reminds you a lot of the lighter side of Hell Yeah. Much better than anything Metallica will do, for sure. ;o)","classification":3,"fold":1}

Especially when it's the kind of album that I can put on repeat and listen to over and over again and each time it starts over, rather than thinking \"hmm, what should I listen to next?\" I find myself wondering \"how soon I can get to the record store to pick up the CD?\"  As a music junkie with too many songs on his iTunes, this has become the ultimate tribute that my music-pickled mind pays to an album - when the digital copy just doesn't do it and I feel like I've got to take the relationship to the next level.

In the original version, where the song was treated like art, not a marketing tool, Justin Timberlake gave his best vocal performance yet with a 5-star croon. Here, with the shoving of Timberlake, and the addition of Beyonce, she sounds more like the cat whose tail has just been stepped on. To put it mildly, Beyonce is a horrible singer here, and she ruins a perfectly good song. Also, it's not a \"duet,\" but rather, insert Beyonce over the original track, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nOverall, please don't buy this pathetic excuse for a song.

I find this release is similar in tone and delivery to his last release \"October Road\", and standing up to the best of his work from the 70's, classic JT.\n\nBeginning with his 1970 breakthrough classic \"Sweet Baby James\", which catapulted him to worldwide fame, Taylor has turned out a formidable discography throughout the 70s and 80s. His  mesmerizing, melodic material grabs you from the start wrapping you in a warm blanket of \"feels so good\".\n\nOn this release he is accompanied by guest stars Sting and Yo Yo Ma on the nautical, haunting title song Before This World\/ Jolly Springtime.\n\nYou and I Again, featuring Yo-Yo Mas reverent cello, is a simple but affecting love song, presumably for Taylors wife, Kim.\n\nHis easy groove on Stretch of the Highway and Montana, sees Taylor settling into his classic style.

{"text":"I really enjoyed Brandon's 2010 solo debut and was anxious to see what he would do next, especially since The Killers have slowed down dramatically in terms of output. The Desired Effect was well worth the wait and Flowers continues to prove that he's one of the most versatile and infectious artists in modern music.\n\nThis LP is a dramatic departure from the more gospel and country-influenced Flamingo. Brandon is in full-blown pop mode here and it fits like a glove. If you take the playfulness of The Killers' Day & Age album and add more electronic elements then this is roughly what you might end up with. \"Dreams Come True\" is the perfect opener, a sweltering mix of horns and subtle keyboards. There are hints of The Killers here but Flowers never rests upon his band's trademark sound, opting instead to keep it firmly in the background and to forge his own path. The effervescent melodies of \"Untangled Love\" and \"Diggin' Up the Heart\" are infectious, like a ghost of the 80's mixed with modern production flourishes. \"Can't Deny My Love\" and \"Lonely Town\" are some other highlights, as are the softer moments \"Between Me and You\" and \"Never Get You Right\". As a whole it's solid and there's not a single track that feel out of place or unfinished. It's something you can listen to straight through without your attention drifting or feeling the urge to skip, unless it's the kind of skipping that results in dancing, because there's a good chance you'll feel the urge to move and shake to some of these tunes as well. I prefer to do it in private because I can't dance but your milage may vary.\n\nIn the end I'm beyond thrilled with this record and how Flowers has once again pushed himself sonically. It's a perfect album to kick off your summer and should easily tide over fans waiting for The Killers to get back in gear. It doesn't get much better (or much more fun!) than this.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"James Horner's score for Star Trek III is a bit personal for me.  It was the first soundrack I can ever remember wanting to own, and once my father finally did get me the cassette, my 8 year old ears must have listened to it about 1000 times over. Now that it's nearly 20 years later, that number is probably closer to 10,000, but never like this.\n\nFilm Score Monthly has made possible what I thought was impossible.  I had given up hope that the Star Trek franchise would never get the expanded music treatment that the Star Wars movies and the Lord of the Rings movies got.  Finally getting to hear recordings of the Self-Destruct sequence...finally getting to hear the spectacular music behind the Genesis Armageddon.  It's more that I ever thought we'd ever get.\n\nFSM's Star Trek III Expanded Soundtrack - a must buy for film and music lovers alike!

{"text":"I have seen this name Sufjan Stevens appearing on year-end best-of lists, but never really took notice other than he's an accomplished folksy rock singer. Well, I decided to find out what the fuss is all about by listening to The Age of Adz. Boy, I was blown off and completely overwhelmed by Stevens. My first thought was was that he kinda sounded like a younger Damien Rice but I could not be more wrong. Sufjan Stevens is a genius and The Age of Adz is possibly the year's must-listen album. The musical styles are varied, his voice impassioned to no end and the songs are impeccably stirring.\n\nThere's never a dull moment and each composition is layered - a great mix of rock, folk, electronic and pop but none threatens to create disharmony. Instead, it's a pretty delightful amalgamation.  And Steven's lyrics are certainly most insightful and personal. Choice tracks include  Now that I'm Older, I Walk, Futile Devices, Too Much and of course, the 25-minute epic Impossible Soul. No one would imagine sitting through a song of such great length but what Sufjan Stevens has created on Impossible Soul, some artists could never muster in their entire career. The song itself is distinctive and unique, thematically running but wrapped in a myriad of styles and  melodies. While most monster-length compositions suffer from some form of disjoint, Impossible Soul works on all levels. Imagine my joy at the end of each day now is to put Impossible Soul on play and slowly savour it. Now, I call it The Age of Great! Still, it is sad that Sufjan Stevens remain so incredibly underrated but then again, it could be a blessing and if he continues to be able to put out such great music, there's no short of ardent fans and supporters.","classification":5,"fold":1}

I remember listening to her *years* ago when I was a teenager, but I haven't heard any of her 'new' stuff in forever.\n\n\"Womanizer\" is a solid dance song - it has a good beat, and I like the vocals - I'm impressed at how much deeper and lower Spears' voice can go now that she is a little older. I don't know how much of it is natural talent and how much is post-production tweaking, but this just sounds a lot richer and fuller than the way I remember Britney Spears.\n\nCheck this song out - you might be surprised to learn that it stays in your head. Like all Amazon MP3 downloads, this MP3 is DRM-free and plays beautifully, without fuss on my MP3 player.\n\n~ Ana Mardoll","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"If there is one word that describes Nonpoint, it would be \"resilient.\" The South Floridian act have weathered many hard-ships that have sunk lesser bands. Through label shake-ups and band member break-ups, Nonpoint have kept plowing straight ahead, for better and sometimes for worse. When they emerged in 2012 with a new line-up and a self-titled album, they sounded refreshed and revitalized and ready to conquer the world. Unfortunately, on its follow-up, \"The Return,\" Nonpoint set their controls to \"cruise.\"\n\nIt's not that \"The Return\" is bad or offensive in any manner. It's nowhere near the clunker that was 2010's muddled \"Miracle\" or 2007's numbing \"Vengeance,\" but it's not really anything special, either. On the surface, everything sounds fine. The band (still the same line-up that played on the self-titled) are still in top form, chugging along at just the right pace. What's really missing from the mix though is the ear-candy that has come to define the band. You know what I'm talking about; \"What A Day,\" \"Bullet With A Name,\" \"Left For You,\" etc. In the past you could always rely on this band to churn out at least a few hook-heavy tunes per album. Sadly, \"The Return\" offers nothing of the sort.\n\nLord knows the band tries to keep things fresh. \"Widowmaker\" takes on an old-school Metallica aesthetic that is surprisingly competent and tastefully done, but is unfortunately countered by the mis-guided, bro-rock anthem of sorts, \"F**K'D.\" Like their tendency to follow up greatness (\"To The Pain\") with mediocrity (the aforementioned \"Vengeance\" and \"Miracle\"), it's a one-step forward\/two-steps back scenario with this album. For every fun, heavy, catchy and\/or thrilling moment, Nonpoint lift its collective leg to drop a dud or two. The dual-guitarist approach serves the likes of \"Know Myself\" and \"Breaking Skin,\" but sadly, frontman Elias Soriano isn't on his A-game. Most of the album works as passable background music if you don't listen too closely, but sadly a deeper listen reveals a well-produced and well-played album that lacks significant hooks or memorable melodies.\n\nIn typical Nonpoint fashion, they parted ways with guitarist Dave Lizzio and replaced him with B.C. Kochmit (Eye Empire) soon after recording of the album was complete. Hopefully another change in line-up will give the band another wind and they'll come back swinging with another album that hits hard. Otherwise, there is, for lack of a better term, no point.","classification":3,"fold":1}

I mentioned in a review of that CD that very seldom did anyone cover a Hank Williams song better than he did himself. I noted the exception of Lucinda on that rendition of \"Cold, Cold Heart\". I also made the same statement on her cover of Mississippi John Hurt's \"Beulah Land\" on his tribute album. Finally, I noted the fine job that she did on a duet with John Prine on \"Wedding Bells\" on his \"In Spite Of Ourselves\" cover album of country classics.\n\nThat said, although I have high, very high regard for Ms. Williams' cover work I am more ambivalent about her own albums. This album under review is such a case. I do not understand what is driving her on some of these songs. She, obviously, can write thoughtfully of love, lost, the cruel nature of the world, her family and other subjects but for the most part that feeling I got from the above-mentioned efforts is missing here. A few do, however, stand out. \"Mama You Sweet\", \"Words\", \"West\" and \"Rescue\" clearly rise to the occasion. As I say, the rest is so-so and suffer a little from trying to cross-over from her country base.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Chrisette Michele\n\"Let Freedom Reign\" (2010)\nThis is yet another modern  R&B  project badly produced. The vocally gifted Chrisette Michele fairs best on ballads. The strongest of which is \"I Don't Know Why, But I Do\".  The other ballads are lyrically mediocre and under-developed. The title track has unique rap, spoken word elements coupled with an oddball vocal arrangement.  Less guest appearances would have been the way to go on this misfire.  Guests tend to take the focus away from the featured artist.\nAudio-tune and other vocal tweaking devices are wasted on Michele's self sufficient vibrato. Let  the vocally challenged Brandy, Britney Spears and Rihanna use the tricks. They need the tricks. Michele doesn't.  I hope Michele's next release takes a more natural approach as was exhibited on her debut in 2007.","classification":2,"fold":1}

{"text":"I've been hearing a lot of complaints about DEVICE, one of the obvious side projects of DISTURBED, sounding way too much like DISTURBED, and even some complaints about it sounding like an electronic version of DISTURBED. While DEVICE, in terms of formula, sounds a lot like DISTURBED, there's actually other elements that make this a unique album, and one of the highlights of this year's laundry list of albums. There's a lot more of a industrial metal type sound featured, similar to the approach of bands such as NINE INCH NAILS, SPINESHANK, STATIC-X, and MINISTRY. Also, the guitars are tuned to Drop A, while DISTURBED's lowest tuning was Drop C, which somewhat makes it sound different, at least to me. And to fans who are disappointed that they didn't get an album like TEN THOUSAND FISTS or INDESTRUCTIBLE: yes, there aren't any techincally talented solos featured. There aren't much thought-provoking topics as featured on DISTURBED's last album ASYLUM. But, rarely does that level up to an album being terrible, and DEVICE's self titled is far from a disappointment. Now, if you look at Dan Donegan's side project FIGHT OR FLIGHT's album A LIFE BY DESIGN, there is an album that screams \"disappointing\", but for somewhat different reasons. If you're really familiar with the DISTURBED formula, and you also like to see new musical elements added to a band's sound, then you will find DEVICE to be a great record.\n\nRating: 4.5 stars\/5 stars","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Prime Cuts:  Float, I Won't Let You Go, The Day that I Found God\n\nSwitchfoot returned to its surf culture roots with \"Fading West,\" where ocean-inspired reverbs and sandy percussion were its sunny-sounding canopy.  Such a recess from their post-punk rock sound has done the group well.  Sounding rejuvenated and packed with more grace-gilled melodies, \"Where the Light Shines in\" is easily one of Switchfoot's best albums to date.  Rather than falling back on their heavy rock default sound, the sounds here are more purposeful and more varied.  Parts of the album still retain the Switchfoot grunge vibe, but this is also balanced by some more restrained and mellow ballads as well.\n\nSwitchfoot's journey began in 1997 with the first of three indie releases before signing with a major label in 2003. Since then, the San Diego, CA based outfit have sold 5.7 million copies worldwide of their nine studio albums (including 2003's The Beautiful Letdown and 2009's GRAMMY Award-winning, Hello Hurricane). Where The Light Shines Through marks the band's return to the indie world and showcases that, two decades from their start, they're able to have a career filled with longevity, revitalization and rejuvenation.\n\n\"Where the Light Shines Through\" is the band's 10th album and the years of recording, writing and touring have given Switchfoot a wizened depth to their songs.  The title cut \"Where the Light Shines Through\" is easily one of the best treatise on suffering that is both Biblically responsible as well as creative. As suffering has a way of making feel alien to the world, the use of the space imagery to underscore the theme of how God can use our pain for his glory is just sublime.  In a musical culture where imagery is sneered, take a listen to \"Holy Waters.\" Here you will be engulfed by the vividness of the song that you can't help but \"see\" the song unfold like a breathtaking movie before your eyes.\n\nPartnering with Lecrae over some hip hop beats is \"Looking for America.\"  The rhetorical use of questions in the midst of the song reaps some serious soul-searching rewards. Then Switchfoot gets to the dance floor with \"Float,\" which also boasts some Prince-like guitar riffs that the late Purple Highness would be proud of.  Recalling back some of the older Switchfoot sound is the swaggering \"If the House Burns Down Tonight.\"  They get into some heart-wrenching moments with the story song \"The Day I Found God,\" which contains the moving line: \"The day I lost myself was the day that I found God.\"\n\n\"I Won't Let You Go\" is the reason why this reviewer is a Switchfoot fan.  Never ones to shy from the complexities of life, yet still able to find the peace in life's chaos, \"I Won't Let You Go\" is faith in its most palatable form.  Forget all the manufactured and manicured songs out there.  If you want songs that engage the messiness of life and yet do not betray the truth of Scripture, check this album out immediately.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"The Low Anthem released an excellent second album in 2009 \"Oh My God, Charlie Darwin\", which charmed me to no end, bringing a curious but intruiging mix of Americana-rooted music along with some other hard to classify more upbeat music. Quirky but oh so good. Now comes the band's 3rd album.\n\n\"Smart Flesh\" (11 tracks; 46 min.) continues the band's exploration of Americana music, and then some. The opener \"Ghost Woman Blues\" (don't let the blues reference fool you) sets the table for the album. \"Boeing 737\" is about the only harder-charging track on here (and also the shortest song on the album, under 3 min.). After that it's back to the slow and softer music, not that this is a complaint. Check out the beautiful and pensive instrumental \"Wire\", for one. As the album goes on, it becomes clear that this is a mood piece, much more so than the band's previous output. If you're in the mood for it, it'll play great. I myself love it.\n\nI saw The Low Anthem again (saw them at Bonnaroo in 2009 support of the \"Oh My God\" album) recently at the MidPoint Music Festival here in Cincinnati, and what a show that was. Playing in almost darkness, the band brought many of the songs from this album, along with a couple of tracks from their earlier output. You could hear a pin drop when they were playing some of their quieter songs, just fantastic. I was equally amazed at the band's musical flexibility, with band members moving around from one musical instrument to another, just wow. Meanwhile, \"Smart Flesh\" is highly recommended!","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Though \"Quiet Is The New Loud\" lacks a hit like \"I'd Rather Dance With You\" from their newest album \"Riot On An Empty Street\", every song here is wonderfully mellow and good enough to make it a better album overall (that one had some bad tracks). Erlend Oye was clearly blessed with one of the most soothing voices in the music business. Not only are the vocals great, but the lyrics are also very interesting, even if they lack catchiness. That's not really what this album's about anyway; it's about relaxing. The instrumentation is also pretty simple - it's basically just acoustic guitars and drums, but they're wonderful here - they perfectly encapsulate the mood. \"Failure\" and \"I Don't Know What I Can Save You From\" may be the standout tracks, but, really, they're all wonderful. They may not be breaking any new ground here, but they don't really have to - you're going to love it anyway. Practically any music fan will love this, and for that it definitely earns \"5\" stars. You'll never get tired of listening to this! This is highly recommended!\n\nHighlights include:\nthe entire album!","classification":4,"fold":1}
{"text":"This is not Prince's best and not his worst either.  With the added Bria Valente cd, it gives Lotusflow3er the extra spice it needs to be a bonafied Prince classic affair.  With 3 cds to choose from, each cd can conjur up whatever Prince mood your in.  I actually got really into the Bria cd, it's new and fresh music you don't quite hear anymore.  It's like Vanity lite with a breathe mint.  Her voice is a little more soulful than Vanity and Apollonia but still evokes that latina passion intensity we all have grown to love.  Here is a breakdown of her album:\n\n1. Here Eye Come:  5\/5  a sexual groove with cool lyrics and vocals.  I think Prince had to write this song.  I imagine it being played in a love scene with Eva Longoria on Desperate Housewives.  Strange!\n\n2. All This Love: 4\/5  a drippy love jam u can sing a long 2.\n\n3. Home: 5\/5  the best song on the cd.  The lyrics and vocals are Bria at her best.  It reminds me of something Martika would have sung 4 Prince during that era in the 90's.\n\n4. Something U Already Know: 3\/5  ur basic Bria jam, they could've added alittle sumthin sumthin to make it stand out more.\n\n5. Everytime: 4\/5  She has a video to this song, only saw a clip.  It's a airy jazzy jam that grows on u.\n\n6. 2Nite: 3\/5  I think they intended this 2 be a club jam but it comes across as amateur dance material with Vanity type vocals.\n\n7. Anotha Boy: 3\/5  If we lived in another world this could be a #1 pop hit but we ain't livin' in that kinda world no mo.  Cute song but it's not the 80's.\n\n8. Kept Woman: 5\/5  My fave song.  I can play it over and over. I love the lyrics and vocals are amazing.  Bria shows that she's not a one trick pony.\n\n9. Immersion: 4\/5  a mystical groove with creative and intense lyrics.  It puts u in a trance of Bria's mysterious world.\n\n10. Elixer: 4\/5  A strange duet with Prince.  A foreshadow of what's to come in Lotusflow3er.\n\nLotusflow3er is the centerpiece of this Prince affair.  It's the mystical cd that is more grounded in Beatlesque mystique and rooted in rock, rhythm and blues.\n\n1. From The Lotus: 2\/5  not quite into this ordinary elevator type music intro.\n\n2. Boom: 3\/5  Tick, Tick Boom..... I liked that song better than this.  It's a typical Prince rock jam that doesn't hit the mark for me.  Not a memorable song in my oppinion.\n\n3. Crimson and Clover: 5\/5  considering I perform this song live, Prince copied me!  I love his version but what ruins it for me is the fading in and out of the vocals.  He ruined the song for me by doing this, the effect does not work, it makes it seem like there's something wrong with your stereo.\n\n4. 4Ever: 4\/5  a soulful luv groove, peace luv and happiness.  Prince could have added more to the song to make it more creative.\n\n5. Colonized Mind: 5\/5  my fave song.  I heard someone jamming this in their car and it sparked up a Prince conversation.  I luv the lyrics and the vibe on this one.  Classic Prince.\n\n6. Feel Good, Feel Better..: 4\/5  a jazzy Prince jam that will sound great performed live.\n\n7. Love Like Jazz: 3\/5  Ok Prince we get it.\n\n8. 77 Beverly Park: 3\/5  instrumental groove that sounds a bit like the instrumentation of the song \"With You\".  A friend played this song on repeat for literally 2 weeks to chase a roomate out of his apartment b cuz he didn't pay his rent.\n\n9. Wall Of Berlin: 4\/5  a rock affair with crazy Prince lyrics.  it has 2 grow on u.\n\n10. $: 5\/5  a funky Prince jam with cool vocals.  Luv or $?  $$$!\n\n11. Dreamer: 4\/5  guitar oriented Prince jam thatrocks u out.\n\n12. Back 2 Lotus: 2\/5  filler track not needed.\n\nMPLSOUND is Prince covering all of his previous sounds from the past. It's like Prince imitating Prince, if that makes sense.  i prefer his previous work but this is cool new Prince stuff so ya can't complain.\n\n1. There'll Never be Another: 4\/5  a bit repetative but has a cool breakdown.  His name is Prince!\n\n2. Chocolate Box: 3\/5  I really liked it at first but after a couple listens, it gets so repetative and goes on for 2 long.  That worked on the 1999 album but not here!\n\n3. Dance 4 Me: 5\/5  my fave song on the cd.  Camille returns on vocals, a party jam 4 me and U.\n\n4. U're Gonna C Me: 4\/5  Entertainment Weekly said this is the best song on the entire LotusFlow3er cd collection.  Not quite but it is a cute slow jam with infectuous lyrics.  Not Prince's best!\n\n5. Here: 3\/5  Ugh......that's it, just Ugh.\n\n6. Valentina: 4\/5  a song that makes u wanna ask Prince the story behind this song.  Who is he singing about, Sofia Loren??  A strange song and a bit repetative.\n\n7. Better With Time: 3\/5  another one of those new Prince ballads that just doesn't compare to the classics, \"Insatiable\", \"Do Me Baby\" etc... How will he ever top himself.  It sounds like Prince wanted to make this a hit, good luck.\n\n8. Ol Skool Company: 2\/5  I'm sorry I hate this song.  This is the same artist who did \"Housequake\"?  This is a pale imitation of a dance jam Prince used to be able to do.  He could have added some old skool samples, the beat is lazy and just stupid.  He does give shout outs to Sheila E and The Time.\n\n9. No Mo Candy 4 U: 5\/5  maybe he wrote this song about me, cuz it sounds like I'm dissing Prince on the internet.  hey, i don't have to like EVERY song on a prince album, but I love this song.  It's Dirty Mindesque, the vocals are spazzy and intense and the song has a raw 80's energy.  Yes Prince, I want some mo candy, baby!!!! GIVE IT 2 ME!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"In recent years, the reputation of \"Drama\" ,Yes' only previous album without singer Jon Anderson, has been rehabilitated, and the album has found many fans. In many respects, \"Fly From Here\" is \"Drama,Part 2\". The album reassembles 4 of the 5 members of the \"Drama\" line-up(bassist Chris Squire, drummer Alan White, guitarist Steve Howe & keyboardist Geoff Downes), and the 5th \"Drama\" member Trevor Horn is involved heavily, not only as producer, but as co-writer of nearly all the songs. These days, Horn is so successful as a record producer, that he has no need or desire to become a touring musician again. Oliver Wakeman, who had been Yes' on stage keyboardist in recent years, has been ousted in favor of bringing back Geoff Downes, so obviously creating another \"Drama\", and reuniting the Horn-Downes songwriting team(previously known as the new wave duo \"The Buggles\") was the main priority. Still, Oliver Wakeman appears as a sessionman adding some additional keyboards on a few tracks.\n\n  As for singer Benoit David, formerly of a Yes tribute band, his role is merely to sing; not to have creative input(he does have a co-writing credit on one song, probably for modifying an existing lyric). If Mr. David's on stage role is to sound like Jon Anderson, his role in this album is to sound like Trevor Horn....and he does, but better, because Benoit David has a more extensive note range than Horn. David can sound like Trevor Horn in the lower part of his(David's) range, but can reach high notes that would be a strain for Horn to hit. In his other groups, Benoit David has only recently branched out to write a few lyrics. Though he can reportedly play some guitar, he sticks strictly to singing here. He's lucky to be in the same studio with his heroes. And, as for the fact that nearly all of the album's lyrics are by Trevor Horn, it should be explained that though the documentary DVD shows that Benoit David does speak perfect English, he is a French-Canadian, for whom English is a second language.\n\n  As for the songs, the title track is a vintage track from the \"Drama\" era which had been performed on stage, but never recorded. Here it is expanded to a 20 minute progressive piece. Musically, the album is not as progressive as the 1972-77 material, but it is not bluntly commercial radio rock like \"90125\" or \"Big Generator\". Oddly, the one respect in which Jon Anderson is very much missed, is as a lyricist and conceptualiser.\n\n  And if Fans have wondered why Jon Anderson didn't rejoin the group after resting for six months due to respiratory problems, it is because, as with Rick Wakeman(who has heart problems), Anderson's health would not hold up to prolonged international touring. Anderson & Wakeman(both together and separately) still play local gigs in England.\n\n  If it is a choice between \"Yes\" continuing with new members, or not continuing, I'm happy that they're continuing. The sound is unmistakably \"Yes\". And anyhow, Chris Squire owns the \"Yes\" name, and is within his rights to continue the group.","classification":4,"fold":1}

Is it fair?\n\nDon't get me wrong but hey whats fair is fair, i mean i know Savatage members are still in TSO. But let's review; 1. Al petrilli left Savatage in the middle of Poets and Madmen album to join Megadeth then Dave Mustaine kicked him out, why take him back Paul O'neil?\n2. Zak stevens (Sang only in Beethoven's last night) left Savatage to be with the family and surprisingly came back and made CIIC band and being rude enough to come ask Jon Oliva for his help! Come on!\n\nOverall, I say since Savatage members are happy we should be happy that at least they got the attention they deserve even under TSO name.","classification":1,"fold":1}

Then a few years later some Brits named the Audio Bully's also got to use the song for free and remixed it.  Unbelievable, it was a huge hit in the UK!

And this new album is indeed like going to a reunion of good friends and sharing good times.\n\nMany others have remarked about how strong this album is, and how it brings back memories of JT's great early 1970s albums, and I can only agree with those opinions. It's certainly not an exaggeration: It's as if James Taylor has been drinking from the musical fountain of youth, sounding as youthful and buoyant as he did back in the day, on albums like \"Mud Slide Slim\" and \"Sweet Baby James.\"\n\nI won't bore you with a song-by-song breakdown of the tracks on this album. Suffice to say that these new tunes sparkle and shine, supported by strong melodies, Taylor's ageless vocals, and some impressive lyrical depth. If you've been a James Taylor fan over the years (decades!) then I think it's safe to say that you will be very satisfied with this excellent new album. I only hope it won't take another decade-plus for him to release some more new material. This one is sheer musical bliss!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"It feels slightly weird reviewing a single song. Many times tracks make sense in the context of the entire album even if they do not work as a song. But as singles are now the prevelant form of digesting popular music these days, so it goes, I s'ppose.\nAnywho, \"Oh Love\", the first single from Green Day's upcoming album \"!Uno!\" (to be followed by \"!Dos!\" and \"!Tre!\" in a succession of a few months) is the audio equivilant of mediocrity. There is no compelling hook to bring you back and the lyrics seem to have been written in about two and a half minutes with zero thought put into them. And the production is colorless, giving the already bland rocker a lack of flavor or style that should make the song popular for about a week on the radio but zero lasting value.\nFollowing \"21st Century Breakdown\", a record that certainly didn't grow on me as the years passed, this is an even greater disappointment. I can't imagine anyone wanting to hear this song once or twice outside of a cursory listen to see what Green Day has been up to for the past few years.\nYou'd be better off saving your money and buying a Buzzcocks single or something. Even at a low price this is pretty much a rip off.","classification":2,"fold":1}

{"text":"This album has been critically acclaimed by many of my friends and reviewers alike, and after hearing Swoope's guest spot with KB on his debut album, I knew I was picking this up quickly. I wasn't disappointed...yet I expected a bit more. I've heard many tout the amazing cohesiveness of the record, and how it legit sounded like a movie. Well, I got that impression for parts of the CD, but sometimes I was confused on what the \"story\" was getting to. The plot could be a bit hard for me to follow. In the end, I got the gist of it, but it would be a lie to say I could follow it perfectly. There were some great songs though, and ironically, my favorites did not add to the conceptual plot of the album. #sameteam was a terrific song featuring 5 of CCR's talented artists. It was awesome, full of sick flows and nice references. I'm not going to critique each of the concept tracks, because the project needs to be judged as a whole; that's what I did. The project is greater than the sum of its parts, with a few great extra songs thrown in (TGC 2, Best of Me).","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"When Glee originally started, I have to admit that I expected a lot more vocalistic music than what ultimately began appearing on the soundtrack CD's. While I have found each of the discs to be enjoyable, they've often had their share of Karaoke Plus type of moments, and rarely outdid the original versions of the songs they started off covering. \"Glee Presents The Warblers\" changes that.\n\nFor starters, they enlist an actual Glee Club (the Tufts' University Beelzebubs) to perform the bulk of the vocal work. Then they give the lead focus to Darren Criss (Blaine on the show), one lead to Chris Colfer (Kurt) and a pair of duets for the two. It centers the album more than the other soundtracks, essentially making this Criss' debut album. Criss has a pleasant, boy-band type of voice, while Colfer sounds like the show-tunes worshiping kid he plays on the show when it's time for him to hit The Beatles' \"Blackbird.\" (He's good on the Lennon-McCartney numbers; Colfer's version of \"I Want To Hold Your Hand\" remains a series standout).\n\nThe selection is a solid representation of any typical \"Now That's What I Call Music\" CD, with current pop holding court. I was already partial to The Warblers' version of Katy Perry's \"Teenage Dream,\" then they chart similar courses on Beyonce's \"Bills Bills Bills\" and Maroon 5's \"Misery.\" They redeem the long reviled McCartney \"Silly Love Songs\" and manage to make Barbra Streisand's \"What Kind Of Fool\" into the kind of song the Bee Gees might have done if Barry Gibb had kept the song for himself. (However, I doubt anyone will every be able to sing \"Do You Think I'm Sexy\" and make it anything better than a piffle.)\n\nThe constancy of \"Glee Presents The Warblers\" make it the best of The Glee series. It also may be the first starmaker of the series, propelling Darren Criss into a promising solo career. Now where's Colfer's solo?","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Forget everything you knew about Coldplay, \"Speed of Sound,\" \"Clocks,\" all have been turned upside-down in amazing and glorious fashion. Coldplay drops their trademark sound for something completely different, and the world of music might never be the same again.\n\nThe sound is possibly indie, definitely something out of the U.K., and certainly something new we've never heard before. It's surreal, it's art, it's a new breed of rock. The lyrics are not as cryptic as previous efforts, but still not a spelled out song, with the only chorus making a shred of sense, \"If you love me, won't you let me know?\" A haunting picture is painted of winter, and the song certainly paints and fits the mood.\n\nChris Martin never sounded better vocally, and they go perfectly with the song. As for catchiness, I don't think this is one you'll be singing in the grocery store, but you'll remember the general feel of the song.\nAs for negatives,  there isn't any. Take the song, or leave it. It certainly won't appeal to everyone.\n\nOverall, not the first thing you'd think of when it comes to summer music, but I see a world in which this song becomes a big hit. Certainly over the pond. The song is a haunting painting of ole', with originality, and the element that really makes the song, the mood. You might not find another thing like it, and you're certainly not going to confuse it with something else. Let more U2 comparisons come in, they're as good, and should be as successful. Take it or leave it, Coldplay never ceases to amaze.","classification":5,"fold":1}

So it has been awhile for him to regain his footing on his music. He has tried it again with his latest single, Love Like This from his album Lyrics. I really didn't find the song to be anything really out of the ordinary to what he could've turned out to be in his songs. It really wasn't really anything to rave about, to deliver from his Where I Wanna Be mastered days. Hopefully, he can deliver with more amazement for his fans to accept him all over again.

{"text":"Amon Amarth have been on a roll for over a decade now, and still don't appear ready to slow down anytime soon. Their new album, Jomsviking, doesn't offer a great deal in the way of surprises, which in itself is no surprise when it comes to AA. What it does offer is another batch of excellent metal songs that continue to show a great deal of maturity and professionalism. It's hard to believe that an extreme metal band like Amon Amarth have achieved as high a level of success as they have, but after years of consistently superb albums and legendary live shows, it's completely deserved. Jomsviking is not overall one of the band's fastest albums, but the songs are well-crafted, blending their familiar mix of melancholic melody and rapid-fire death\/thrash. I'd put it easily on par with their last several releases, with maybe Surtur Rising being the closest in approach since that one also slowed down the pace and relied more heavily on their melodic qualities. Sonically, though, Andy Sneap again gives them the most crisp, clean sound they've ever had, which suits them to a tee.\n\nThere's a nice flow to the album, which starts fast with a classic era melodic death metal track, First Kill. The next three songs range from mid- to up-tempo, highlighted by the power metal groove and thrash riffs of Wanderer, the pure energy of On a Sea of Blood, and the really cool verse riff on One Against All. The pace begins to slow with what is sure to be the band's next live favorite, Raise Your Horns. A slow-paced stomper with anthemic lyrics and a cool chant section, what is basically a death metal drinking song....yeah, this one will go over pretty well with AA's crowd. Next, The Way of Vikings is mid-paced, catchy, and pretty standard. The energy picks back up with At Dawn's First Light, featuring an abrasive thrash-style vocal pattern in the verses. Then comes the album's slow, melancholic track, a common element for AA, called One Thousand Burning Arrows. This sonically layered opus shows how much they've grown within this kind of sound since the early days. All of the last three songs are quite strong. Vengeance Is My Name is a chugging thrasher that sounds a bit different for them. A Dream That Cannot Be oddly features guest vocals by metal goddess Doro Pesch, which offers some variety and is a good song, but it also feels somewhat out of place, like it would have been better as a bonus track (yes, I realize it's a concept album, but I'm just going by the way it sounds). The album closes with the expected epic,, a 7 minute plus tune that starts slow and brooding, builds up in pace until it gets fast, then slows back down at the end.\n\nAs they have since their inception, Amon Amarth delivers the goods. While they've grown as musicians and songwriters, they never stray too far from their core sound, to the continued delight of their fanbase. Chalk up another victory for everybody's favorite Viking metal warriors.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"\"Stay the Night\" by Benjamin Orr of the Cars is his most notable solo hit. It has a cool soothing vibe that was most popular during the eighties. For some reason, I can always picture this song being blasted out of numerous car stereos during the 1980's on those moonlit Friday and Saturday night dates. It's definitely slower and a bit more poppy than much of the other Cars stuff that he's known for...I'm not sure if that was by design or trying to fit into the cornucopia of music that comprised the 1980's. The more I listen to the song, I realize that there's something dark and slightly creepy about this song maybe its' the sound like crickets chirping in the background or the low hum in the background that sounds like human breathing.

I was in complete awe on how she can still belt out those amazing notes!! What else even made it very special was the fact that the drummer is the son of the late and great John Bonham.

{"text":"The Mystic Knights of The Oingo Boingo have come a long was since presiding in the Devil's Chamber in that truly cult classic, THE FORBIDDEN ZONE, directed by Richard Elfman {sibling elf}, a highly entertaining venture into the vortex of utter madness. Since their innovative neo-punk beginnings, Danny Elfman has led the Knights onto many musical victories, including his own solo projects, & finally, movie scores. Such titles as BATMAN RETURNS, BEETLEJUICE, THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE XMAS, NIGHTBREED & EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, are among his celebrated compositions.\nThe name has been put through the guillotine, severed in half to display a highly crystallized evolution. A focus on heavier rhythm guitars have been added, giving the album a sharper edge. The cover displays an interesting little clown, deformed in his composit. The back shows some aesthetic terrorism as well.\nNow, this erubescent, modern-day Wolfgang brings forth a series of songs which speak from his satanic heart, of anti-assimilation in the jesting guise of conformity. Particularly noticable in the cantible \"Insatanity\". where the voices of little ones valiantly defy xian indoctrination by recognizing its unnaturalness. Also exposed is the hypocrisy of evangelists in their two-faced, money-grubbing, sexually-twisted forms.\nAnother favorite is \"Mary\", which is the common story of a blossoming midwestern girl breaking the apron strings to see the great-wide-world. The rub here, is that she enjoys what she feels, & for the first time, comes unto her own realizations & conclusionsnow thyat her overbearing xian family is out of the picture. It is quite an emotionally-evoking piece, especially when the syubbornness of her unfortunately xoid kin is displayed., in their unacceptance of her, when she finally finds something she really enjoys. Indulging in the pleasures of the flesh, & living a decadently hedonistic lifestyle which brings her satisfaction, & a sense of accomplishment. She was a bigger fish than they - she had ambition. I don't think it was too much of a blasphemous coincidence that the name hosen was \"Mary\", as in \"virgin\". By the way, the violins are sublime.\nThere's also a remake of the Beatles' \"I Am The Walrus\", a fun song that has been played at many a frat party, no doubt. SPIDER is an enjoyable diddy about he who glares from the wall. WAR AGAIN is an inspirational tune about war & the adrenalyn & tragedy of battle. It inspires pride. It is powerful in its emotional evocation, as the words are definitely felt, greatly compliments the music.\nOverall, this release is an experience, which is rare in the pop-\"music\" industry, with their trivial, monotonous, monosyllabic, non-music blare. Like Elman's other works, all which make an impression upon the listener, this is sure to please the discriminating, amalgamate, audial conniseur.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Honestly, I have not really been intrigued by girl groups for the past decade, because they have not had the strike in the hotness of the iron, while the songs were hot from the soul. Unfortunately, Fifth Harmony has been more like the tween group that hasn't shown that they could blossom louder than words. I had found that so far the songs that the gals have made for their 7\/27 album, have been below par to the soul that they could have set afire. Their only song that showed that they were maturing with the essence of the soul was Write On Me. Their other tracks like Work From Home ans All In My Head (Flex) were not very solid. That's My Girl, their latest single, again falls short of being a more empowering anthem. It doesn't work in the same way that someone like Beyonce' had with Run The World (Girls.) It just doesn't have the staying power that groups used to have like En Vogue or TLC. I think that Fifth Harmony needs to really find their deeper, inner voice that can set the world more aflame than what it currently is, just a small candle wick.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":1}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nWith that said, I did pay for this this song.  If however, you are just looking to build a music library on a budget, I'd highly recommend checking out Amazon's free \/ cheap collection of music, featuring songs as well as albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies or really good digital music deals (69 cent songs, $5 albums!), you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Departments (drop down menu) --> Digital and Prime Music -->Deals --> Songs by Price \/ Albums by Price (on left side of screen)","classification":5,"fold":1}

But the guitar work on that particular song is nothing compared to what he throws down on the excellent (and proper jazz) songs, \"Affirmation\" and \"So This Is Love?\"\n\nBut those two are just my favourites. All six tunes are great and this is another of those CDs I put on repeat anytime I play it. One listen is very rarely ever enough. Great production by the celebrated Tommy LiPuma with the orchestra arranged and conducted by the equally legendary Claus Ogerman.

{"text":"The Good\n\nHypnotic drum beats lead the charge on \"Feel.\" A catchy melodic chorus and subtle guitar riffs will take you the rest of the way. Soulful and emotional vocals dominate the piano laden ballad \"King of Might Have Been.\" You may make comparisons to \"Hard Habit to Break\" here, but the song does a great job of standing alone. It's the multi-part harmonies and warm brass that really draw you into \"Caroline.\" When you read the lyrics the song seems a little cheesy, but when you here how Chicago presents it, it's quite encompassing. Rascal Flatts makes an appearance on the optimistic ballad \"Love Will Come Back.\" \"90 Degrees and Freezing\" echoes the group's 80s high-end production and sound. \"Already Gone\" is loaded with plenty of pop-rock melodies and signature Chicago horns.\n\nThe Bad\n\nI thought that the remixed version of \"Feel\" was unnecessary. I didn't really care for the blandness of \"Come to Me, Do\" either.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nI really didn't expect this album to be so good. Chicago returns with their thirtieth album, after a ten year break, and shows that there's no rust on them. XXX is a powerful and melodic pop-rock experience. I never really wanted to listen to Chicago post-Peter Cetera, but after hearing this, I've had a change of heart.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Merle Haggard & Willie Nelson\n\"Django And Jimmie\"\n(Sony Legacy, 2015)\n. . . . .\n\nWillie and Merle have recorded together before, but this album has a special resonance -- it's a lot of fun to listen to, and holds up really well. These two old-timers are having a great time here, with each of them are at their geezerly best, singing robust, humor-filled songs -- some oldies, some new stuff, and a sweet mix of novelty songs and heart-rending weepers.  \"It's All Going To Pot\" is the standout track -- a stoner-delic double entendre gem which basically says, sure the world's going to hell in a handbasket, but my buddy Willie sure can score some great weed.\n\nThey wax nostalgic about music and musicians, including a raunchy song about Johnny Cash where they tell old war stories about Cash's crazy years, and they pay homage to gypsy jazz legend Django Reinhardt and blue yodeler Jimmie Rodgers in the album's title track. Another album highlight is \"Live This Long,\" where they marvel at their own longevity (considering all the damage they've done over the years) while on the more serious side the ballad \"Somewhere Between\" is a devastating dissection of a man's painful self-awareness of a love gone wrong.  They add strong covers of Dylan's \"Don't Think Twice\" and the gospel classic, \"Family Bible,\" along with various outlaw tunes.\n\nBuddy Cannon's production adds a hearty, round-toned feel and, as on other recent albums, he again proves himself a perfect collaborator with Willie Nelson, giving his music a clarity and simplicity that makes each song a highly listenable gem.  You won't be disappointed by this album: it's every bit as good as you'd hoped it would be. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Country Music)","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Somewhere In Time sounds very much a product of the era in which it was made.  That's not necessarily always a bad thing.  But, we saw the [sad] trends that invaded the metal community in '86, such as Priest's \"Turbo\" and UFO's \"Misdemeanor.\"  Luckily, Maiden did not bow to the \"public tastes\" nearly as much here as on the aforementioned failed experiments.  However, Somewhere In Time definitely has lost a considerable amount of wholup when compared to Piece Of Mind and Powerslave.  The first signs of a band on auto-pilot show up here on the tunes Heaven Can Wait,  with a melody that tries way too hard and turns out being annoying (though the vocal chant is fun), and the plain yawner Deja Vu.  However, much of the rest is trademark Maiden, albeit with a few synths and a more commercial sound than before.  Even catchy lead single Wasted Years sounds like it was meant as a hit, while the hardest track, Sea of Madness, has a radio friendly solo break spliting it down the middle.  Alexander the Great revisits past history lessons with mixed results, the song being complex enough even if the ly-rucks are a bit half baked.\n  Somewhere In Time will be forever tied to spandex and big hair (thankfully Maiden avoided the hair thing).  Even Eddie looks a too tech. But the album art is cool and contains a bunch of references to Maiden's previous work.  Overall, Somewhere doesn't go much of anywhere... but does a better job doing it than most of the releases from this time from England's metal elite.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"These Bach Guild collections are invariably worth purchasing. I have several of them myself, and the only reason I don't own them all is that it would result in too much duplication of music that I already own and don't listen to often enough to make extra performances worthwhile.\n\nI picked up their latest release, this Volume II \"Big Baroque Box\" collection, for several reasons (beyond the attractiveness of the price).\n\nFirst, it has a great deal of music that I do not own now and am not familiar with (but am interested in). There are composers represented on this set that are completely new to me, and I always welcome the opportunity to pick up something that includes music that I have no previous exposure to. At least half of this collection is music that does not duplicate performances that I already own, which is unusual for such collections. It also concludes with an hour and 40 minutes of music that was originally released as a 2-LP set in the 1970's, \"The Instruments of the Middle Ages and Renaissance\", which is very well described in Morgan R's excellent review and is a very interesting and educational survey of baroque instruments and performance practices.\n\nSecond, the quality of the performances are quite good. I've only listened to a portion of the 11 hours and 42 minutes total (214 tracks of music in all), and what I've heard so far has been excellent.\n\nIn addition to the music composed by less-familiar composers, this set provides a very nice selection of well-known works from composers such as Handel, Bach, Albinoni, Tartini, Rameau, and others, including complete set of performances of the Brandenburg Concerto's by the Josef Suk Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Josef Suk. The collection has been organized so that it begins with a group of familiar pieces, all performed by Leonard Friedman conducting the Camerata of St. Andrew - Mouret's 'Fanfare for Trumpet', followed by Albinoni's Adagio, Handel's 'Entrance of the Queen of Sheba', Bach's 'Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring (from Cantata No. 147), Pachelbel's Canon, Gluck's 'Dance of the Blessed Spirits', Bach's 'Sheep May Safely Graze' (from Cantata No. 208).\n\nThere are a few minor complaints to be made regarding the packaging and labeling of the collection. For some reason, either the Bach Guild or Amazon have not included Composer information on the tracks, so they have to be manually added after you download the set. They do include the composer information at the beginning of the title to each track. Making those changes to how the music is identified in your digital library is a minor nuisance and only necessary if such things are important to you (as they are to me). I've also found at least one error in the collection when I downloaded it - there is a duplication of tracks within the Brandenberg Concertos that needs to be corrected, and I've pointed that out to the Bach Guild.\n\nAdded comment after first writing this review - another customer has noted that this box is promoted as \"14+ hours of music\", however the actual total is just under 12 hours as I note in my review title. It doesn't detract from the bargain that this is, but obviously the Bach Guild made a mistake in creating the artwork for the album. Hopefully they will correct it soon - either to fix the album art, or maybe they'll add another 2+ hours of music in order to fulfill their statement!","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"The year was 1960 and few boy groups - with the exception of the Lettermen - were successful. Names like Frankie Avalon, Bobby Vinton, and Bobby Rydel were considered the kings of youth music. But all of that was about to change. Before the Beach Boys, you had this foursome. The Four Seasons emerged that year 1960 with not one or two but several 45 hits. They dominated the top of the charts and took America by storm. First with \"Sherry\" quickly followed by \"Walk like a man\" and then \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" the Four Seasons brightened up sleep overs and slumber parties everywhere. Girls couldn't get enough. The 60's arrived big time in most part to the new sound coming from New Jersey and that sound would shape the decade to come. Solo acts would fall to the side. Groups would dominate.\n\nLater, when Frankie Vali stepped out in front of the group to bask in his own glory, the shine fell off the rose and the rising star of the Four Seasons began to fall. Vali tried to go solo only to find his voice lost in the Beatles\/Stones era of music, where it never really rose to its former heights. Vali's career ended by fading away into obscurity... until a little Broadway play came along four decades later.","classification":5,"fold":1}

There is a beautiful and informative NPR episode about him: Israel Kamakawiwo'ole: The Voice Of Hawaii. Apparently he was a very funny and soft-spoken man and his rendition of this song took the world by song storm. Although his family died from complications of obesity, and he knew he likely would as well, he wasn't worried about dying. Being Hawaiian, in his words, because they \"live in both worlds,\" he was very connected to the eternal nature of the Soul. In the aforementioned NPR interview he said:\n\n\"I was scared when I lost my mother, my father, my brother, my sister,\" Israel told de Mello. \"I guess this is gonna sound kind of weird, but I'm not scared for myself for dying. Because I believe all these places are temporary. This is just one shell. Because we Hawaiians live in both worlds. It's in our veins. When our time come, don't cry for me. Don't cry for me.

{"text":"Natasha Bedingfield really knew what she was doing when she recorded a few years ago, These Words, and Unwritten. For her latest song though, it shows that can try to make a good song stand out, but it feels like it is flavor of the moment. Pocketful Of Sunshine, the title track and second single from her sophmore album feels a little more upbeat than the collaboration with Sean King on Love Like This, but it just doesn't unfortunately really feel like it has stood out to being definitive from Natasha and her unique lyrical style. I like the beat of the song, but I was hoping from a bit more soul into the lyrics. Hopefully, when she comes out with her next single, it will sound much better tahn just a pocketful of the moment.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":1}
{"text":"This album contains the underscore for \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" as composed by Tyler Bates.  I think it is a solid effort with enough emotion to make it a worthwhile listen - while it's not as good as the scores from the Iron Man films, it is better than a few other Marvel efforts.\n\nGiven the context of the film, the original score for Guardians is certainly overshadowed by the 70s songs in the movie. But Tyler Bates is very a talented composer, and he delivers an emotional underscore here that serves the story well. It's not as compelling to listen to on it's own as disc one of this album, but there are some interesting tracks that I've found myself revisiting.\n\nFavorite Tracks\n[12] Sanctuary\n[20] Sacrifice\n[22] The Ballad of the Nova Corps.\n[26] Groot Cocoon","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"To start off with, I also agree that the track Flat On The Floor has got to be THE best way to kick off a rock album!!  Overall, the sound of this album is much harder than the last.  The songs on Silver Side Up were too much alike.  And I got so sick and tired of hearing How You Remind Me every time I turned on the radio!!  But on The Long Road, I like pretty much every song on here! The only song I'm not too wild about is See You At The Show.  That track almost seems juvenile in a sense. I hear it and I think of the teenage garage band playing by my friend's house after school.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Mary J. Blige's new album \"The London Sessions\" comes barely six months since her criminally overlooked \"Think Like A Man Too\" soundtrack. So titled as it was recorded in London with some of the finest UK singers\/writers\/producers.\n\nInspired by her working with UK Dance duo Disclosure on the remix of their hit \"F For You\", the album strikes a delicate balance between vintage Mary and a European club sound. The doo wop\/Blues-tinged Sam Smith co-penned \"Therapy\" opens the album picking a gospel fervour in its closing minute. \"Why should I spend the rest of my days unhappy, when I can go to therapy two times a day\" she sings. The bluesy piano ballad \"Not Loving You\" is another Sam Smith co-write which wouldn't be out of place on an Adele album. Other outstanding ballads are the acoustic \"When You're Gone\", the Emeli Sand co-penned, Naughty Boy-produced \"Whole Damn Year\" (minimal and piano sprinkled with raw emotional lyrics), and the closing spare piano ballad \"Worth My Time\".\n\nThe atmospheric club banger \"Right Now\" is one of two songs with Disclosure, the other being the fervent \"Follow\" which recalls \"F For You\". \"My Loving\" has a chilled late night feel kicking into a house tempo. I can imagine this playing on a late night drive through the streets of London. \"Nobody But You\" is a moody pulsing number I could imagine from Katy B, while the Naughty Boy co-penned \"Pick Me Up\" features clarinet sprinklings and stabs of piano perfectly accentuating the clipped dance beats. \"Misery loves company they won't let us grow\" she croons.\n\nThe arrangements, especially on the upbeat numbers never crowd out her vocals. They are spacious and allow her to express her emotions. My only complaint is that there aren't more club numbers. A winner!","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"You know I didn't know if after Prince retired his \"royal badness\" persona and the parental advisories stopped appearing on his albums if his music would survive intact. Well obviously Prince hasn't gone \"soft\" one bit. It's been a great 30 years since he first rocked the music world with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/For-You\/dp\/B000002KIG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">For You<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Prince\/dp\/B000002KKN\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Prince<\/a>&nbsp;at the end of the 70's and here he is:musically free and full of the wonder of it. This set,only available through Target stores (at least at the moment) really showcases Prince's talent as an artist,bandleader and a producer on all of it. But he showcases all his talents individually as well by presenting three seperate CD's here:two by the man himself and one by a new female singer Bria Valente. So for starters what does Bria have to offer us on her debut 'Elixer'?Well on this Prince produced album the jazzy,high voiced Bria puts her vocals on top of a set of largely modern jazzy soul tunes,the best of which are the sensual \"Here Eye Come\",the breezy Brazillian styles of \"Everytime\" and the pumping retro disco-funk groove of \"2Nite\".Other cuts such as \"Another Boy\",\"Immersion\" and the title cut again find her in a jazzier frame of mind. Throughout the sound of Prince's rhythm guitar give no doubt where the music is coming from. As for the Prince albums the basic release is titled after his most anticipated part of this 'Lotusflow3r'.Where it's been hyped as Prince \"rock\" album,and it is in some sense there of course is so much more here then that. Recorded with a full band sound (I'd have to assume the same personel as the last two Prince albums) the psychedlicized wah-wah pumping and guitar gymnastics of \"Boom\",his cover of \"Crimson And Clover\",the hit \"Dreamer\" and the two part title song do find Prince rocking out with fine style and power for all the guitar heroes out there. On the other hand he also offers up plenty of surprises with the excellent \"Colonized Mind\",another great message from him about thinking for yourself. This album also thinks of the hard core funk fans with \"Feel Good,Feel Better,Feel Wonderful\",another great JB's style groove dedicated to the life affirming qualities of the funk. On \"$\" (meaning Money from the lyrics seemingly\" streches out a similar groove. Two of the most unconventional tracks are the like minded smooth groove of \"Love Like Jazz\" and the Italian flavored instrumental \"77 Beverly Park\",with Prince touching on a musical sound even he's never touched on in the past. He rounds the whole thing out with two ballads in \"4ever\" and \"Wall Of Berlin\". There wasn't a lot of talk about the other Prince offering here 'MPLSound' but there sure should be more because it's very important for Prince lovers to here. On this album Prince pulls out his talent as a one man band,blasting right back to his classic 80's sound (with a modern twist) as if he...well was follwing up an album like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sign-O-the-Times\/dp\/B000002LBM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sign 'O' the Times<\/a>&nbsp;or something-it could even have been recorded entirely with the Revolution! It features one of Prince greatest 1,2,3 punches with the three jams \"(There'll Never B) Another Like Me\",the pounding \"Chocolate Box\" and \"Dance 4 Me\"-everything from the LINN drums,guitar and synths are right out front! The whole thing is personified with \"Ol' Skool Company\",a down and dirty jam that boils the whole thing down to a 21'st century Minneapolis sound,stating bluntly that new artists need to express themselves more creatively and should be able to get radio play in the doing,the concept Prince has preached (even symbolically) from the start. The whole \"new funk of many colors\" concept continues with two exciting,quirker jams like \"Here\" and the rollicking \"No More Candy 4 You\",another cut against \"fake\" music. Again there are ballads such as \"U're Gonna C Me\" and \"Valentina\" that again express the sensuality and mystique of classic Prince. Modern production touches a bit on the tingly \"Better With Time\" but still he's firmly in control of what he does. In the end Prince is here and there's no doubt he's still got it. I am no more sure then anyone what that \"it\" is but it's been getting our attention and funking us up for over three decades and,at least if this is the direction Prince is heading in the future it's sure looking to be a good one! So as he himself would say listen,peace and B Wild!!!!!","classification":5,"fold":1}
{"text":"I am a SPOON \"newbie\" (and instant fan!)  I recently became acquainted while watching \"Georgefest: A Tribute To George Harrison\" Concert Special during which Britt Daniel performed \"I Me Mine\" & knocked it \"out-of-the-park\"!!! (Amongst a cast of many great musicians & talented performances...a wonderful show!)  I sincerely hope Britt's \"I Me Mine\" shows up on a future SPOON record!  Well, I was instantly sold & had to research to find out who this was & quickly learned of SPOON.\n\nI was quite incredulous to learn SPOON'S been around for more than a decade, now, making such fantastic music!!  There's something very wrong with the recording industry that such a talented band can be in existence for so long & not be more well-known.  However, once you've heard them, they will become instantly recognizable & unforgettable!  I knew immediately that I would be making a SPOON purchase.  The difficult decision came with deciding which SPOON CD to begin with!  All of their music is absolutely fantastic!!!  After some deliberation, listening to music samples & reading other customers' reviews, I did narrow it down to 3 (which wasn't all that easy, since they're all excellent!): the newest, \"THEY WANT MY SOUL\", \"Kill The Moonlight\" and \"Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga\", eventually choosing 'THEY WANT MY SOUL\" and I'm thrilled with my decision!!\n\nWhile all the songs are absolute winners, my particular favorites are the title track, which is SO GREAT, the phenomenal  beat-driven opener \"Rent I Pay\" (turn it up!!), \"Do You\", the incandescence and sheer beauty of \"Inside Out\", the intriguing juxtaposition of the serious lyrics on \"Let Me Be Mine\" set to a fun, whimsical melody, the haunting lover's lament of \"I Just Don't Understand\" and \"Rainy Taxi\" which I must have listened to 10 times before likening a musical instrument, or notes, to being vaguely reminiscent of Donald Fagen (in particular) and Walter Becker, better known as Steely Dan, which, by the middle of the song, is totally forgotten, and you wonder if you ever really heard it in the first place!!\n\nSPOON'S \"THEY WANT MY SOUL\" even though it's their newest release, is still a terrific starting point for anyone just becoming familiar with SPOON (but, then I frequently collect working backwards!!)  And, for SPOON fans, I would consider 'THEY WANT MY SOUL\" a must-have!\n\n\"THEY WANT MY SOUL\" is intricate musical bliss performed by highly talented, creative musicians who have been honing their craft for well over a decade, now!!  If SPOON \"Want My Soul\"....they can have it!!!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Maroon 5 is one of the biggest acts to hit the music scene in the past decade and they have tasted the sweet nectar of immortality. Now, we get their 5th studio album which is titled 'V', but I am pretty sure its actual name is Five.\n\nAfter hearing the first three singles I was very excited to get this album so I could hear the rest of it. It had seemed that they had finally mixed their penmanship with the ultra pop sound that they gave us in their previous album. I didn't get what I excepted. Oh sure you now get an R&B influenced album with a little bit of 1980's new wave sound, but you don't get those deep meaningful lyrics that you got from the first three albums, just mainstream fluff. After track 3, you get such a lull full of that fluff until you get to track 9 and the last three songs (not including the bonus tracks) once again give you that good feeling from the first three tracks. So, I guess my question is why couldn't the whole album be like this?\n\nI am not going to say that Maroon 5 is losing a fan here, I still find 'V' to be a good listen, there is nothing truly bad about it. I guess the question is, as someone who has been listening to them since 'Songs About Jane' will we ever see that band we first met back in 2003? If this is truly the future of Maroon 5, they may very well lose me after all. I am only hoping that their 6th album will take some time to construct before it is given to the fan base.","classification":3,"fold":1}

I definitely can hear the maturity in the band's songwriting. Like in the '80s, the women all harmonize perfectly together as well as take turns singing lead. I enjoyed all the songs.

I thought, oh no, here we go again. Here we go with another Nickelodeon person who thinks they can be successful releasing music. Then I heard \"Best I Ever Had\" and I hated it at first. I was thinking, what in the world was he thinking and he could have been recording another episode of Degrassi instead of this crap. But as I continued to listen I found myself singing it randomly during the day. I was laughing to myself because I knew I hated the song and now I cannot get enough of it. Then \"So Far Gone\" came out and it all fell into place for me. I enjoyed every track and could not wait for his next release. My ratings of this album is as follows:\n\n1. Houstatlantavegas: 3\/5. This was a little more out of my style of liking than usual but good to listen to on occassion. Just not on repeat for me.\n\n2. Successful: 4\/5.

{"text":"Denver, Colorado-based guitar player and instructor Tom Carleno ventures out on his first solo recording, and it's quite the auspicious debut.\n\nThis is not your standard solo acoustic finger style guitar album, as many of the compositions are written and performed with alternate tunings. Carleno's creativity displays his ear for unusual and stirring tunes, and his dexterity on the guitar is masterful. Carleno is also joined on one track by his wife Josie Quick, who provides unique percussion by way of spoons.\n\nThis is a fine album that should appeal to fans of solo acoustic finger style guitar as well as anyone who enjoys original captivating music.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"The evolution of Depeche Mode hit stride when they tackled their fourth album. Instead of the thinly structured synth-pop of the two follow-ups to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Speak-Spell\/dp\/B000ESSTKQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Speak & Spell<\/a>, \"Some Great Reward\" took the plunge into the heart of darkness. They'd gotten caught up with technology, giving the sound a fuller feel, and the lyrical content became more mature and cynical. The Dominance\/Submission roleplay of \"Master and Servant\" (which was the second single) and the sociological blast of \"Blasphemous Rumours\" picked and cut deeper than before.\n\nThis was also the album that made Depeche Mode in the states. \"People Are People\" got into the American Top 20, and according the liner notes by producer Daniel Miller, the first thing recorded for the album. Egalitarian in tone, DM apparently even tried to darken the sound of the song lest it be construed as too pop. Those three particular songs make \"Some Great Reward\" on a par with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Violator\/dp\/B000ESSTL0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Violator<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Black-Celebration\/dp\/B000002L9M\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Black Celebration<\/a>&nbsp;for consistency.\n\nLike all the reissued back catalog of Depeche Mode, the 5.1 remix of the bonus disc is terrific. It fills the room with both the arena ready music that the Mode was growing into, but emphasizes the industrial samples the band was adding to the music. The clanging metal and factory wheezing leaps from the mix and shows just how ahead of the curve the band was. As for the mini-movie, \"You can get away with anything...\" chronicles the band working on the LP. I doubt I'll watch it more than twice. A pair of B-Sides and a remix of the lovely \"Somebody\" round out the package.\n\nGiven that Depeche Mode would next reach their emotionally darkest music by the next CD and then blast to superstardom (\"Black Celebration,\"&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Music-for-the-Masses\/dp\/B000002LCI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Music for the Masses<\/a>), this is the CD where you can here it drop into high gear.

{"text":"Being a 20 year \"fanatic\" of Ann and Nancy Wilson (yes, pun intended!), it's great to see that they continue to rock audiences in their fifth decade.  With 2010's \"Red Velvet Car\", it was a much more stripped down affair.  But this time around, the guitars are cranked up to 11.  The Zeppelin-style, 70's sound that they created back then has returned.  And both Ann and Nancy are still in rare form, considering their overall longevity.\n\nMy favorite tracks are \"Mashallah!\", \"59 Crunch\" (a rare instance of Ann and Nancy trading off their vocals), \"Pennsylvania\", \"Walkin' Good\" (love the duet with Sarah McLachlan!), and \"Corduroy Road.\"  This album is proof that any band or artist can still rise above the \"rest of the rest\", 4 or 5 decades into their music careers.  If you purchased the Best Buy version of this LP, you will have 3 additional tracks.\n\nMost recently, Ann and Nancy were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.  And boy, did they sure deliver on \"Magic Man\" and \"Barracuda.\"  On the former song, all of the original members from 1976's \"Dreamboat Annie\" were present.  Most recently, Heart released their live CD\/DVD combo which is in support of \"Fanatic\", so please don't forget to pick it up.  I know I will -- I can't wait to see how well they perform live!  :)","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Remember when Brit pop was the flavor of the month? Oasis, Spice Girls, all seemingly ruled the world. Well, now it's trying to make a comeback with Leona Lewis, and former HillSong singer and song-writer, little Natasha Bedingfield.\n\nThis time, she doesn't bring any phony rap artists, but rather, herself and a backup singer. The result is distinctively Brit Pop, but maybe a little more suited to today's audiences. The vocals are the same as always for Bedingfield. The music itself is typical modern music, take it or leave it, although my description is a bit vague. The song is minorly catchy, but pretty much standard Brit Pop stuff that is overly forgettable.\n\nOverall, forgettable, Brit Pop, standard, maybe a bit boring. So if you like Bedingfield's other \"work,\" you'll like this song. If you're a hit radio zombie, you'll also like it. For the rest of us, just pass. You're not missing anything.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"As Jim Morrison once wrote \"This is the end, my beautiful friend....\" (The End - The Doors).\nLike a lot of you I was disappointed by several things. One being that most of the content was from the last album Pink Floyd made, The Division Bell, and it the new album in in essence is partly scrap material, stuff that didn't make the grade 20 years ago. Another complaint is that there is only one lyrical track, but at least it's new.\nHowever most people that are truly complaining about The Endless River before the album was even released must not be aware of Pink Floyd's content on the majority of their albums is largely instrumental and then some of the songs are sparse with wording and are largely instrumental. Songs such as \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" on the Wish You Were Here album have Part 1 & Part 2. The song is so long with instrumental work that it open and closes the album. There are many more examples of pure instrumental work on their albums. So to those who write reviews and are complaining you must not know very much about Pink Floyd.\nDavid Gilmour has announced that Pink Floyd will not be touring with The Endless River. The reason given is that it wouldn't make sense to tour without Rick Wright who passed away in 2008. Rick Wright was the keyboardist for Pink Floyd. Also many are complaining that Roger Waters isn't on the album. I am a huge Roger Waters fan, but he hasn't been with Pink Floyd since the early 1980's. Again those complaining need to do some reading on why Roger Waters is no longer with Pink Floyd and hasn't been in over 30 years. I wish that on at least one track that he could have been apart of the final chapter of Pink Floyd but he's not and his last chapter was the album, The Final Cut (which coincidently was largely made of scrap material left over from the album, The Wall).\nSo the story of Pink Floyd is over. The book is now finished. Or is it? One truly never knows, but I do feel that its done. I grew up fascinated by the lyrical genius of Roger Waters and the mesmerizing guitar of David Gilmour, the timing of Nick Mason on the drums and the crash symbols on Comfortably Numb will always bring out the heart wrenching lyrics that Waters had written. Richard Wright doesn't get the credit he deserves. When you mention Pink Floyd one could think of the sounds and special effects coming in. That was Richard Wright for the greater part. He is and was a huge part of Pink Floyd's signature, so I see Gilmour's feelings about not touring with The Endless River. What was once four sadly became three and then very sadly became only two official members of Pink Floyd. It would have been interesting to see the amount of money that could have been made with a final tour. I wouldn't have been surprised to see it go over the billion dollar mark.\nDavid Gilmour has also said that he is working on a solo album and will tour with it. Roger Waters will also be making a new solo album in the next year or two. I have went to see Roger Waters three times in concert. Once in the late 1990's and I was luck enough to see him preform The Wall, twice. On a interesting side not Roger asked David if he wanted to join in on the tour but David declined.\nThe history of Pink Floyd is a very interesting history. I encourage those who are dismissing this new album to reflect on the bands past and their work. Justice is not being done by complaining about this and that. Lets enjoy what we have because its a lot better than I thought we would ever get,","classification":5,"fold":1}

I have to admit I haven't listened properly to a lot of the stuff that's out there at the minute but if this doesn't win some kind of award for hip-hop album of the year somewhere, then all hope is truly lost.\n\nMostly produced by the man himself (except for \"Move\", which is produced by the late, great J Dilla) this is precisely the kind of thing I'm looking for when I buy a hip-hop album. I don't claim to be a connoisseur but the with the use of a couple of cleverly used samples here and there, music's tight, the beats are tight and Tip is at his lyrical best. He drew criticism for his last album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Amplified\/dp\/B00002R0K9\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Amplified<\/a>&nbsp;and while I remember dancing to \"Breathe And Stop\" and \"Vivrant Thing\" until I thought my legs were gonna fall off, I can see what people were saying. It was definitely more radio-friendly and more pop-oriented that we ever remembered ATCQ being in their heyday.\n\nNo such concerns here. Guests like Raphael Saadiq, D'Angelo and Amanda Diva pretty much deliver what one might expect of them but Norah Jones sounds like I've never heard her sound before and never thought I would. Good on her and wise choice, Mr Q-Tip.\n\nIf you like your hip-hop authentic and are looking for an album that's solid from start to end, you most definitely need to check this one out. You'll be bouncing and bobbing all the way through. \"Joyfully motivational\" was how my local newspaper described the album and I couldn't agree more.\n\nAnd the most remarkable thing of all?

{"text":"Death discs were an important part of pop music in the 1950s and early 1960s. One of the most memorable was \"Tell Laura I Love Her\" in which a teenage driver had a fatal accident in the stock car race he had entered to win cash to buy a wedding ring. The tale was all the more effective for being sung in an angelic high tenor by Ray Peterson.\n\nRay Peterson was born in Denton, TX on April 23, 1935. As a young boy he contracted polio which required lengthy hospitalization. But while in the hospital he began to sing for the other patients and decided that is what he wanted to do with his life. In 1957 Ray Peterson moved to Los Angeles and signed a recording deal with RCA Victor. He had several modest hits and then in June of 1960 RCA released \"Tell Laura I Love Her\" written by Jeff Barry and Ben Raleigh. It would become a Top Ten hit.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.","classification":4,"fold":1}

{"text":"Beautiful Stories For Ugly Children is either the seventh, fourth or third album by the criminally underrated band Mushroomhead, depending on your views on record contracts and compilations. It is their second album with Waylon Reavis in one of the band's two lead vocalist positions. Since its release in 2010, the band have lost Pig Benis, Gravy and Lil Dan, who all appear on the album, as members.\n\nDespite still containing large chunks of influence from Alternative and Industrial music; Beautiful Stories' is arguably their most straight forwardly Metal release to date; with a lot more double-kicks, chugging and up-tempo tracks than on their previous albums. At times, there is even a very clear Zack Wylde\/Dimebag Darrell feel present in the tails to the riffs and there is a hell of a lot more lead guitar than on any previous Mushroomhead release.\n\nFurthermore, there are also a lot less of the dark and creepy moments from the band's early work to be found here. There is nothing like `Chancre Sore' or `The Wrist' on the album for example, which may in fairness be a bit disappointing for certain fans, but the album definitely does make up for ignoring one aspect of the band's sound with its consistency and the excellent, memorable songwriting.\n\nRight from the beginning, the album is charged and exciting, kicking off with the very fun opening track `Come On' which pretty much sums up the entire new focus in direction in one track.\n\nThe next four tracks are all excellent, very much following in that same direction, but with enough variety each for the album not to sound homogenous, then from that point on the album lets a lot of variety sink in. There are still touches of Faith No More's influence present in the vocal patterns and choice of keyboard sounds, but you'll also get a really Tony Iommi sounding riff here, a bit that could fit on a Chimaira record here or even a vaguely Ministry-esque drumbeat there too.\n\nWhen this is focused yet varied musical direction is combined with the hugely improved production job and mix (courtesy of their drummer Steve `Skinny' Felton) over the last record, and the fact of Waylon's voice being an established part of the band already this time around, this is a very impressive and instantly enjoyable record, arguably even their best to date. If you have anything more than a casual interest in the band, this is definitely not an album to skip.\n\nHighlights include the faster, heavier tracks like `Come On,' `Darker Days' and `Burn The Bridge,' as well as the interesting percussion-based `Harvest The Garden' and the proggy `Holes In The Void' which sounds like an even more intense reworking of their cover of Pink Floyd's `Empty Spaces.'\n\nThat being said however, there is not a single track here that is forgettable, weak or out of place; it is a remarkably consistent album and the kind where you can have a new favourite track on every listen.\n\nThe songs are all big, the riffs are all satisfying and there are lead guitar breaks going off left, right and center. The combination of this direction and the existing styles of vocals, keyboards and electronics from the `Xii' album in particular, results in a brilliant and utterly enjoyable record.\n\nOverall; for a fan of the band, this album is an absolute must-have. It may take a few listens to come around to if you primarily like the band through the filter of a more Industrial or Alternative fanship but will likely become your favourite Mushroomhead album if you listen to it through the filter of a more Metal fanship.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library.  With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing.  It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.  Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon.  Thats right!  Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too.  In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.  Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great!  At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free\n\nFREE ALBUMS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Albums by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":1}

There are, of course, several of the sweeping, schmaltzy, Orbison-esque ballads that Malo excels at, as well as some bouncier, twangier songs, and a little bit of Latin swing. I prefer the band's uptempo tracks, and there's plenty of both kinds of music on here to satisfy any long-time Mavericks fan.

{"text":"Ok, there have been a few lengthy epistles on this album here on Amazon, including Amazon's review\/description, so I'll try and keep my review brief.\n\nI loved \"Breathe and stop\" from Q-Tip's debut CD some 9 years ago, as well as his rap on Janet Jackson's groovy \"Got til it's gone\". I didn't realise he had a new CD coming out till it was recommended to me by Amazon, and also when I read my buddy Kayode Balogun's slamming review of it, I just knew I had to get it.\n\nIt's already my top Hip Hop album of the year, it towers above every other release. I love the laid back earthy sound; real sounding percussion, horns, the Neo Soul\/Jazzy vibe, and absolutely no profanities - excellent!\n\nMy favourites include the choppy groove \"WeFight \/ WeLove\" with Neo Soul king Raphael Saadiq (telling a soldier's story of love and war), \"ManWomanBoogie\" with Amanda Diva (with funky guitar and an unbelievably groovy bassline), the shimmery Erykah Badu-channelling \"Life is better\" with Jazz chanteuse Norah Jones which is basically a languid groove with more singing that rapping (not such an odd pairing seeing as she's appeared on albums by Outkast and Wyclef Jean), and the self assertive \"Believe\" on which he managed to drag out the AWOL D'Angelo to provide a killer hook. Fantastic!!\n\nThis is one of those CDs where every song stands out really. Opening is the piano driven Jazzy \"Johnny is dead\", followed by the Seventies sounding \"Won't trade\" (with a rather emphatic rap), \"Getting up\" (which samples a Black Ivory single from the 70s), the scratch-filled Jazzy \"Official\", the half spoken\/sung \"You\", the J Dilla produced \"Move\" (which is two movements; a more upbeat segment with Gaye-like harmonies, and a laid back two minute coda with electronic Jazzy flourishes), \"Dance on glass\" (which starts off a capella with spare instrumentation built in as the song progresses), and closing Neo Soul joint \"Shaka\", also produced by Dilla.\n\nThe last Hip Hop album I enjoyed this much was Mos Def's \"Black on Both Sides\". A masterpiece!!!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"First off, I don't really like country music, except Lucinda Williams, Willy Nelson, Allison Krauss, Dixie Chicks, and, well, ok -- I guess I do like some country music.  But this song is darn near perfect for folks like me: All-American, upbeat, good-time lovin', independent thinkin' kind of folks.  When I can sing along and laugh about all the poor suckers out there in the country with closed minds, stuck in their ruts, hearin' this song for the first time, goin' \"Now here's a good ol' God-fearin' country boy singin' about losin' his girl...\" then \"Hey, wait a minute!  He sounds like he's Agnostic or Atheist or even  Muslim!\"  Well, I just sing along louder, laugh harder and say, \"Thanks Hayes Carll -- that's a gol dang good song you done wrote!\"  With any luck, this song will start a revolution of independent thinkin' folks like Hayes Carll and me, marchin' down Main Street singin' \"Well, if I ever find Jesus...\"\n\nMeanwhile, get your hands on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Religulous\/dp\/B001MFNB5I\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Religulous<\/a>, that's worth a few good laughs, too.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"Look at the cover of this record. Look at the title of this record. Look at the name of the band. And hey, listen to this record, even. No, there's nothing new or unique about Best Coast and their debut record, Crazy For You. The record streamed in advance on Urban Outfitter's website; Bethany Cosentino, the gal who writes, sings and plays guitar in Best Coast, looks like an actor playing a rocker chick in a movie that would surely star Juno; and Bobb Bruno, Cosentino's partner in crime, looks like a million other California stoner dudes who play guitar and wear ironic T-shirts and glasses. The lyrics discuss important things like hanging out, boys, boredom, weed and summer fun throughout the record's 12 pop-rock cuts. It's gross. Seriously, this is a gross record. Even the irony-drenched cover brings the gags.\n\nJust kidding. I absolutely love Best Coast's debut record, Crazy For You, even if it seems like the most obvious summer indie record ever made. I like it because, unlike most of the hip records out this year, it's not a weird record. It sounds almost exactly like that band Girls (also from California), but with a girl singer and a whole lot more consistency. When describing the record to a friend, I said the following: \"No, no, shut up dude! Crazy For You reminds me of that first Strokes record - the one with the hand and the butt and the glove. No, dummy, it doesn't sound like the Strokes. Are you seriousl! LOL! I mean, they could tour together, but it doesn't sound like the Strokes. LOL! Mostly, it's just that it's a super obvious, been there\/done that record that is too good to deny. Seriously, dude, you just gotta hear it a couple of times. It's like that band The Tyde, from a few years ago, but actually good. Or kind of like a sister to that new Wavves record.\"\n\nSaid friend zoned out on me somewhere during the babble; I've not heard from him since. I figure he's either A) totally obsessed with Crazy For You; B) taking a break from our friendship; or C) scoping out AA programs and planning my intervention. Any way you look at it, I did my job. The dude has good taste, and will thus find his way to Best Coast one way or another because, make no mistake, Best Coast made a phenomenal first record. This is the sound of my summer, and surely many others - no shame in sight.\n\nI know what you're thinking - Dum Dum Girls. All Girl Summer Fun Band. Vivian Girls. Times New Viking. All that stuff. Nope, not this one. I've heard all those bands and all those records, and none compare to the fuzzy summer stoner anthems of Crazy For You. The ingredients are simple: imaginary girlfriend vocals; pseudo-surf vibes; Bill Murray and Thurston Moore as super fans; awesomely lazy riffs that echo and bounce; simple drum and bass that never gets in the way; four or more hooks per song; a whole lot a moments that will remind you of your favorite late-90s indie bands; and, of course, Cosentino, who is about as alluring as they come (fyi, I've never seen the girl, only heard her sing). There's also that whole laid-back California vibe, but nothing here really matters more than how many hooks and melodies Cosentino crams into this record. This is pop music. Very cool, very addicting pop music, not at all unlike that first Strokes record. Cut the fat; add some fuzz; nail the hooks; press record; repeat.\n\nYou'll hear these songs in movies for years to come, no doubt. Indie rock high school boys will have a new crush and their girlfriends will have a new hero. This is the record that will be made into a T-shirt and pop up as a point of discussion in a movie starring Jonah Hill, Jesse Eisenberg or Scott Pilgrim. It's a better version of that pretty great Harlem record, Hippie, that got a lot of attention a few months ago. Seriously, as crazy as it sounds, this is a minor classic in the making, and deserving so.\n\nTo recap: Juno; surfer\/stoner; girlfriend vocals; hooks; Girls; California; fuzz; Bill Murray; and melodies. And that's about it. The lyrics aren't deep or complex (\"I want you soooo much\"; \"I'm happy \/ I'm happy \/ I'm happy \/ You make me happy\"; \"The world is lazy but you and me, we're just crazy \/ But when I'm with you, I have fun \/ When I'm with you, I have fun\" etc.), but they always work. And the playing is at all times about as simple as your least favorite local band. But somehow, this record just works. It's fun and easy and undeniable. Records like this don't come out often, not since The Ramones lost their touch. Yep, I'll admit it: I'm in love with Best Coast, even if this is the only record they ever make that's worth listening to, which is very likely.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"There are many great reviews for this record (Disc), but I never saw this as a good Maiden release, even all these years later. The Introduction of Synths aside, most of this is forgettable and standard Maiden. Hardly their shining moment. A bit uninspired lyrically and scattered musically. There is more melody on this, just not much real fire. A major bit of a letdown after such greats as 'Number', 'Piece of Mind' and 'Powerslave'.\n\nGood tracks are - 'Wasted Years', 'Sea of Madness', 'Heaven Can Wait' and 'Stranger in a Strange Land'.\n\n'Alexander the Great' is a really good piece that has many time changes, cool offbeats and excellent, melodic Guitar parts in its 8 minutes. Better than I remembered it from years ago. That is a major plus and why I am glad I went back to this disc. Actually brought my 2.5 rating to a 3. Good, Progressive Maiden.\n\nBut, other than these notes, there are no GREAT tracks at all. Its highly polished and the keyboards\/synths just sound dumb and forced in the choruses. Trying to add more melody for a more radio-friendly Maiden at that time. I was never a big fan of this and still am not to this day, but won't say it totally blows. It was a major letdown after their other releases, we will leave it at that.\n\nI see many disagree in terms of opinion, so maybe its just me. But clearly this is\/was for fans of the 'slicker', commercial Maiden sound. But It would be the first of many seemingly directionless efforts by the band before Dickinson left for a while. It was the end of the 'perfection'-era Maiden for sure.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"When I was young, Nights in White Satin gave me more late night heebie-jeebies than any other song, with the possible exception of Gary Wright's 'Dream Weaver'. My Zenith clock radio with its glowing numbers would be the only light in my bedroom, and I would imagine all sorts of ghosts lurking in the corners or hanging around outside among the trees. A truly haunting, lonely piece of music.\n\nIt starts off quietly, with a flute and some strings and light glockenspiel or something. Then the gently strummed acoustic guitar and drums come in, followed by Justin Hayward's mournful vocals. An eerie mellotron enters the mix at 0:42. I love the mellotron, but wow, what a creepy sound. At 1:06 we get our first dose of the crying angel voices, time to grab my pillow and stick my head under the covers. Imagine Scrooge hearing those at the stroke of midnight. Yikes!\n\nAnother pass through verse and chorus and crying angels, then at 2:18 a big smack of the drum and we head into a gloomy flute solo, accompanied by acoustic guitar and more sad mellotron.\n\nThe night passes on, the moon drifts in the sky, the stars twinkle, clouds pass by, but the narrator does not sleep. He is suffering through the night, having many 'what does it all mean' thoughts: just what the truth is, I can't say anymore. The orchestra cranks it up at 3:50, the crying angels continue to torment us. At 4:35 the orchestra surrounds us with a wall of strings and horns as the narrator rolls around in bed, unable to shake free of doom and madness. At 4:57 we are allowed a brief moment of peace before it all shatters at 5:20 in piercing strings and alarmed horns. It is all too much, and the narrator soon loses consciousness.\n\nAt 5:38 he enters a dream state. There is a brief instant of silence, then the voice of Mike Pinder startles us at 5:54 with the spoken 'Late Lament': Breathe deep, the gathering gloom, watch lights fade from every room...this part would freak me out to no end. I love to imitate the British accent: cold hearted orb that rules the night. After this section, the strings and horns ascend to rage against the impending dawn, making one final stab at 7:00. The final gong at 7:07 signifies the appearance of the sun, and the long scary night is thankfully over.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! I only really bought this album because I heard it was alright and I hadn't heard many of the tracks off it, but I put it in and I was shocked at how good it was! When I first heard the band, I thought they were amazing. I have been a fan of Iron Maiden for about 2 1\/2 years now, and inevitably the appeal of Iron Maiden (or any band that I've been into far some time) has somewhat worn off. However, this album gave me the feeling of \"Oh my God, this is GOOOOD...\", something which I hadn't got from an Iron Maiden album in ages!\nThe music is well structured, the melodies are great and the lyrics are well thought out (compared to most metal bands at the time). Tracks like Caught Somewhere In Time and The Loneliness Of A Long Distance Runner are amazing... dammit, they're all great! I haven't owned this for long enough to decide yet, but this might evolve to be my favourite Maiden album.\nThis is a great album. I don't care who said it was crap (one person even said that it was as bad as \"No Prayer For The Dying\"). I love this album, and it has refreshed my love for Maiden's music where even Piece Of Mind didn't when I bought that a few months ago. This album shows a real sense of maturity and progression. Don't get me wrong, I like thier older stuff as well, but many bands have either produced a string of albums that sound exactly alike or they've changed for the worse. However, just when Maiden thought that they couldn't top Powerslave, they release this - and it doesn't just sound like an improved version of Powerslave! It's probably Maiden's most most unique album in terms of its sound. Fantastic.","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"The Good\nMelodic vocals and a driving chorus super-charge the opening song \"Actions & Motives.\" \"Just Can't Win\" mixes tortured verses with emotionally powerful choruses. Acoustic guitars set the tone for the dark ballad \"Dying Youth.\" \"Focus\" centers more on melody then it does on guitar riffage. \"All Your Lies\" is loaded with monster riffs and plenty of angst.\n\nThe Bad\nAs with most mainstream and modern rock today, there is not much diversity here. Sure, there are rockers and ballads, but the rockers don't break mid-tempo and all sound the same. The ballads fall into the same rut.\n\nThe Verdict\nWhile 10 years have certainly nailed down great vocal melodies on Division, they have faltered when it comes to diverse and interesting rhythms to accompany them. There's not much that defines the '10 Years sound,' as it sounds just like every other band in it's genre.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"First things first, Kelly Clarkson is from Texas.  That said, is there any surprise that Clarkson's prodigious pop pipes can handle some country twang? Of course not.  Single \"Don't Rush,\" a duet with Country darling Vince Gill is the latest track off of Ms. Clarkson's upcoming greatest hits set&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Greatest-Hits-Chapter-One\/dp\/B009LXEBD4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Greatest Hits-Chapter One<\/a>.  The production makes no bones about being a country cut and suits Clarkson well - but we'd expect this. While fans may be used to hearing more pop\/rock and adult contemporary tinged backdrops, the change of scope for this single is welcome and allows for Clarkson to have country-crossover single. \"Mr. Know It All\" was the first hint that Clarkson had a country-side, even if \"Mr. Know It All\" trended more pop on the edge of country than overt country. Those are the positives of \"Don't Rush.\"\n\nThe biggest quibble about \"Don't Rush\" would be that it ultimately doesn't bring anything new to the table for Clarkson. Sure it is 'country' and provides her with 'a different look,' but ultimately it is solid, not say 'exceptional.' Vince Gill provides nice harmonies to Clarkson's lead and Clarkson sounds solid, but you feel she holds back here. Add to that notion that Vince Gill has no notable solo portions in addition to his harmonic contributions and the cut feels 'safe.' The usual 'explosiveness' that listeners have come to be accustomed to is lacking here, even if she delivers a solid performance. That said, nothing about Don't Rush is bad, even if the key change seems to lack the 'oomph' to make it more dramatic and propelling of the cut's energy.  \"Don't Rush\" then may be a bit middling for such a big pop star as Clarkson.  Good, not the next great no. 1 single.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"This is another absolutely don't miss it bargain box from Bach Guild.  I've been scooping most of these up as they've appeared over the past few years but I have to say that I think the three Big Chamber Music Boxes are in many ways the picks of the litter.  By purchasing all three you get almost 24 hours of chamber music, much of it in excellent performances, for under $3.00.\n\nVolume 3 has an emphasis on Haydn and Mozart, with some Boccherini, Beethoven, Rossini and Schubert thrown in.  The two Boccherini Quintets alone are certainly worth the price of admission.  As for Mozart, there's a nice selection of string quintets, a couple string quartets and two piano quartets, as well as the \"Gran\" Partita for Winds (K. 361) and a few other pieces.  Haydn is represented by several string quartets.\n\nThe question I know you're asking is \"What did they mess up this time?\", since it seems that almost every BG Big Box has at least one blooper.  In this case the Mozart Oboe Quartet is the unhappy victim.  What is labeled as the 2nd movement is, instead the first movement of somebody's string quartet.  I'm leaning towards Haydn but has anyone identified it?  What is listed as the 3rd movement of the Oboe Quartet is, in fact, the 2nd movement and the real 3rd movement is nowhere to be found.  Still, there's enough great music here to let me overlook this problem.  Buy it!","classification":5,"fold":1}

{"text":"The advance single Wristband set the tone for Simons latest.  Laying out a funny tale of being locked out of his own performance venue, Simon extends the metaphor to an observation on economic justice.  Presented in his self-deprecating, wry manner, Wristband is classic Simon  except for the bubbling percussion bed undergirding the music.  In fact, half of Stranger is Graceland doubled-down.  Percussion  layered, looped, and even extending to the esoteric, 43-tones-per octave colors of avant-garde composer Harry Partchs cloud chamber bowls  drives half the tracks.  Kudos to Simon for trying a new foundation on which to build his poetic house, but the rhythmic clatter too often obscures his soft-spoken vocals and insightful lyrics.  The other, quieter half of Stranger is more intimate and more effective, highlighted by the title track and the gorgeous instrumental In the Garden of Edie (dedicated to wife Edie Brickell).  Stranger danger:  Cool Papa Bell zeros in with a discussion of the MF-bomb that comes off more like a sophomoric prank than a serious lyric, and clearly not one for the kiddies.  I give the man his due, but Stranger isn't as friendly as Id have liked.","classification":3,"fold":1}

There are two  overlaps: her signature recording - the symphonic saga \"Something In Red\" -  and the pedestrian non-hit ballad \"Standing Tall.\"  The latter tune should  have been dumped in favor of the pretty, top 5 charter \"Out Of Your Shoes\"  (the only significant Morgan recording not found on either anthology).\n  In the five years since her first collection, the honey-voiced Morgan's  track record at radio has become increasingly spotty.  Not surprising,  about half of the hits included here are recordings made before 1995 that  didn't make it onto the first set.  These include her hard-shufflin'  breakthrough single \"Trainwreck Of Emotion\" (choo-choo!), the toe-tapping  #1 \"We Both Walk,\" and the stirring confession \"He Talks To Me.\"  They tend  to make more of an impact than the recent rousers \"Go Away\" or \"One Of  Those Nights Tonight\" and especially, her snoozy duets with ex-hubby Jon  Randall (\"By My Side\") and Sammy Kershaw (\"Maybe Not Tonight\").\n  The five new recordings show a great diversity in both musical styles and  taste.  Morgan's stunning take on the Tammy Wynette classic \"Another Lonely  Song\" is a tribute in every sense of the word and probably her greatest  vocal performance to date.  Meanwhile, the rap-infested \"Whoop-de-do\" is  definitely her worst (Morgan has never sounded so inane).  The remaining  new efforts are a pair of pale \"Something In Red\" imitations (\"To Get To  You,\" \"If I Cry\") and a live recording of the precious Sarah McLachlan hit  \"Angel.\"  Those last three torchy recordings seem to signal the direction  Morgan wants to take her career in the future... what a shame.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"When it has came down to it, we honestly haven't seen many strong cover songs lately. Considering so many R&B acts have been just taking instead samples like Ciara with Never Ever sampling If You Don't Know Me By Now. So for Avant it might feel like a breath of fresh air covering a classic R&B twist on the classic light moods of the 80's classic hit Sailing by Christopher Cross. Sadly, I really didn't feel the sense of comfort in the way Christopher had carried for so many years. It isn't as strong of a cover, as was the case with recent covers like Beyonce's remake of Etta James hit At Last. Still, I would've liked to have heard more sailing away from Avant. Hopefully, if Avant comes out with a better cover song, I'll get a better listen.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":1}

{"text":"With an album of this magnitude (I.e. popularity) this reviewer is of the theory that the most objective reviews will be those of the three star rating. Those looking for another Dark Side of the Moon are going to give it 1 star and the Pink \"Floydiacs\" are going to give a David Gilmour fart 5 stars. I know I am guilty of enough five star ratings myself, but only when deserved.\n\nThe Endless River is definitely not worthy of a 5 star rating but it certainly is not worth of a 1 star either. For the most part, I got exactly what I expected, maybe just a little bit more. \"Leftovers\" put together to create some type of \"whole\".\n\nTER is essentially a Pink Floyd instrumental piece. Only one song contains lyrics, the last one. Sorry, I don't count \"Talkin' Hawkin'\" as actual lyrics. As so many people will weigh in on this and try to categorize it I might as well do the same. For me, this album is quite similar to the often over looked PF album \"Obscured by Clouds\". This album actually came out between Meddle and Dark Side to little or no fanfare.  It hit only # 46 on the US charts. It was the sound track to a movie, \"The Valley\" (La Vall&eacute;e) by Barbet Schroeder, and like TER contains snippets of music that complimented segments of the film. Likewise, these too can be listened to as individual songs or as a whole piece of music. Obscured does have a few more lyrics but roughly half the segments are instrumental pieces. Personally, I really enjoy it; which is probably why I also enjoy \"Endless  River\". ER can easily be imagined as a score to any number of nature documentaries or a Stanley Kubrick space epic. (Hint, hint, hint). In comparing it to more recent works it is definitely of the same timbre as Gilmour's \"On an Island\". A smooth, almost \"elegant\" mix that conveys a mood of relaxation.\n\nWith that said, I was most pleased with David Gilmour's guitar work on ER. I was ready for it to be just a soundscape highlighting Richard Wright's keyboard work, which it does, but Gilmour's guitar work often comes to the forefront adding some punch to what otherwise might become boring pieces of music. We must also keep in mind that this is not \"new material\" per say but a glimpse back to where the group was in 1994 and then put together with the sensibility of now 68 year old men. (let's call it \"creative editing\") It ain't going to rock folks. But to me, it is really not entirely a sleeper either. The segments are short enough to rapidly move through the entire piece without any individual segment to be so long as to get outright boring. Nick Mason displays some admirable drumming on \"Skins\" and as already mentioned Gilmour's \"blues tinged\" guitar work is always a pleasure to the ears. His guitar solo at the end of the last track,\"Louder Than Words\", while not a \"Comfortably Numb\", does give the band a good send off.\n\nSo...yes. I would recommend purchasing The Endless River not as some 5 star artistic achievement but simply as a worthwhile addition to round out one's PF discography. It's moody, at times ambient, but overall a decent enough piece of music to deserve repeated listening's, especially when a mellow mood may strike you. Purchase it with 3 star expectations not 5!","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Uno started of OK but quickly became boring, Dos was great right from the get-go, Tre is a letdown. It was billed as the arena rock album but in reality is an album where the slow numbers shine and the rockers fail. I can't imagine Green Day playing these tracks live a whole bunch in the future. It seems an album made up of what was left over from the other albums. My guess is they've pulled out two albums worth of tracks that go together and what was left is served here. The problem here is most of what's been served up doesn't cut it. Many of the songs come and go and you don't even notice them.\n\n(B+) - Brutal Love is the highlight of the album. It's almost a straight rip off of several other songs including The Beatles' Oh Darling. Also close to the formula of Oh Love (including the `copy the tune' guitar solo) and is similarly a tad overlong. I like it though, however!!\n(C+) - Missing You is OK but only good filler\n(C) - 8th Avenue is standard filler\n(B+) - Drama Queen is a slower number one of the better tracks though perhaps a tad disturbing...\n(B+) - X-Kid is the best of the `rockers' and a definite highlight\n(C+) - Sex, Drugs and Violence is a bit of nothing\n(C) - A Little Boy Named Train keeps the nothing going\n(C+) - Amanda solidifies the run of nothing. It's no Amy but maybe on par with Ashley.\n(B+) - Walk Away picks things up and is one of the few highlights.\n(C) - Dirty Rotten Bastards surely can't be taken seriously. Just too many rip-offs of other songs for me to like this one. Carmen? and Marine's Hymn or is it Auld Lang Syne?\n(C) - 99 Revolutions brings us back to a nothing song. Identical start to Lazy Bones but is nowhere near the quality.\n(C+) - The Forgotten is OK (there's a lot of just OK stuff here) but not up there with their best ballads. It doesn't really go anywhere\n\nSo unfortunately, at the end of the three albums my fears have been realised - that there's only really one album worth of great material. You could argue two good albums worth of tracks but what would be the point of releasing two? It needed to be three or one but the three hasn't really cut it. Good on them for having a go and I doubt many others could have done better.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Darius Rucker might be best likened to a `chameleon' - he changes musical styles and directions almost flawlessly like a chameleon changes colors.  2008's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Learn-To-Live\/dp\/B001CJOHCU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Learn To Live<\/a>&nbsp;found the former Hootie and the Blowfish frontman (often asked if he is `Hootie') leaning in a country direction.  While that should sound extreme, Rucker is easily able to adapt and with his natural soulful grit and folksy-roots laden sound, it was no stretch to hear Rucker play the role of Charlie Pride.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Charleston-SC-1966\/dp\/B003PON2GM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Charleston, SC 1966<\/a>&nbsp;treads no new ground, but I highly doubt that is unfortunate in Rucker's case.  Here, Rucker smartly sticks to the formula that helped Learn To Live become one of few platinum selling country albums (or albums in general) in this dismal music economy.  Why not stick to what you know as opposed to alienate fans, right?  'Charleston, SC 1966,' with that said, is not a spectacular album, but a solid one that is enjoyable for the most part.\n\n\"This\" opens the album a bit clunky from my perspective, where Rucker's quick paced lyrics come over as a bit clumsy given the fast pace.  Rucker's usually soulful and distinct voice sound a bit tamer here than expected, which is surprising.  \"This\" is  not a bad cut, but it is a bit odd given what the listener has come to expect from the talented singer-songwriter.  The production helps to redeem it, but the real redemption comes with top-rate cut \"Come Back Song,\" which is indeed a `comeback' from a bit of false-start on 'Charleston.'  \"Come Back Song\" features superb production work with acoustic guitars intact with superb riffs throughout.  The songwriting overall is much better here than \"This\" and suits Rucker much better.  Here, Rucker's soulful distinctive vocals shine and it is much easier to `get into' this tune.  The refrain is pop\/country gold and just may be the best written one of the album.\n\n\"Might Get Lucky\" is by no means second rate, even if it is not quite as solid as the valedictory \"Come Back Song.\"  What I like about \"Might Get Lucky\" is here Rucker perfects the `country twang,' something lacking in both \"This\" and \"Come Back Song.\"  \"Whiskey and You\" gives \"Come Back Song\" a run for its money as one of the albums best cuts, finding the tempo slowing down and more restrained production supporting Rucker.  While the refrain (\"whiskey and you\/ain't nothing I can do\/but come crawling back to you\/whiskey and you\") may not be the most substance-laden set of lyrics given the somewhat serious tone of this ballad, it is enjoyable and there is a `rousing' sense about it.  \"Southern State of Mind\" keeps up the momentum with a nice contrast of tempo and nice clear vocals by Rucker.  The chorus is not as simple or `tried-and-true' as say \"Come Back Song\" or \"Whiskey and You,\" but it is still enjoyable.\n\n\"Love Will Do That\" is an uptempo cut possessing a different sound from other cuts; it places great reliance on an acoustic timbre, which is very nice.  Here, Rucker goes for more of an adult-alternative sound, which is different from the country numbers, but this track feels second rate compared to the previous ones.  The instrumental section is a superb touch, nonetheless.  \"The Craziest Thing\" features a `tried-and-true' formulaic approach, but it is enjoyable.  It does not come over as revolutionary, which is the general issue I would note with this album as a whole.\n\n\"Things I'd Never Do\" and \"We Fall Down\" are solid, but not distinctive.  \"Things I'd Never Do\" finds beautiful vocals by Rucker and an awesome, anthemic country refrain.  The problem is that as much as you appreciate Rucker's emotion, it is a bit melodramatic perhaps.  \"We Fall Down\" has a nice cool vibe about it, which differentiates it from other cuts; despite this, it still is not incredibly distinctive.\n\n\"I Don't Care,\" which features country standout Brad Paisley is a better cut and restores some lost momentum to the album.  The production is typical country, but after a few `B' cuts, that's appreciated.  This track could have easily appeared on a new Brad Paisley album.  \"She's Beautiful\" is solid, though not memorable.  \"I Got Nothin'\" falls into the same boat, but closing cut \"In A Big Way\" resurrects some lost energy, ending the album on a high note.\n\nOverall, this album is solid, though not revolutionary.  There are good moments, but the album seems to be `mute' of innovations or new tricks.  Despite this lack to take the album `to the next level,' I understand and respect Rucker's thinking.  Next time out, I would like to hear him extend himself even more - he is MORE than capable.","classification":3,"fold":1}

{"text":"Okay, so I must say, I like this album, but it has too many flaws to overlook.\nWith each review for anything, I use different styles for how product needs to be told, so for this product, This Is What The Truth Feels Like, by Gwen Stefani, I will use the What I didn't like and What I did like.\nOkay, let's get started.\n\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE\n\n* Some of the songs, I feel ended too early. And this happened a lot, which kind of sucked, the ending could've been drug out for ten more seconds at least in a few songs. I don't know if this is just me? But it bothered my enjoyment for a big quantity of the album.\n* Some of the lyrics became repetitive. Sometimes, it almost just felt like a written song, without something for me to get sucked into, because I couldn't ignore the repetition. This was for, from what I can remember, a little majority of the album, but still.\n* The last song, Rare, was what I really liked out of thee entire thing. Before I listened to this entire album in order, as I usually do with all albums, I had already liked Misery and Where Would I Be?, You're my Favorite was good too. But otherwise, while listening to this album, those songs I liked in the past, specifically Misery and Where Would I Be?, just missed me, and the only one that really stuck out was Rare. The song Rare wasn't perfect, but it was better than most of the songs on the album.\n* Also, some of the lyrics, just came off cheesy and silly at times. It has Gwen Stefani's signature flare (which I love, as I have been listened to Gwen Stefani ever since she went solo in the 2000's), but I don't know if it worked with all of the subject matter Gwen was trying to convey. I was divided, while Gwen tried to be serious, and make us feel what she was feeling, I still couldn't shake the theatrical feeling that came along with it. I just don't think the theatrical tone, that I think was supposed to back Stefani's anger for her husband's cheating, worked. It just felt like Gwen's older albums, which isn't a bad thing, but yet again, just (in my opinion) didn't fit the atmosphere of the album overall.\n* At a certain part of the album, when she said that her husband had left, I felt that that was a little bit too rushed. It was like she was angry one moment, and then sad the other. I don't know how cheating feels, and I am sure that there are a lot of ups and downs, but this was just a little problem for me.\nOverall, for the negative side of this album, the lyrics felt repetitive, and I felt the album could've had a lot of potential.\nI am not trying to be mean. This album was very special to Gwen, but still, it felt repetitive and it felt like it could've been a lot better.\nNow, for the good side of the album.\n\nWHAT I LIKED\n\n* Her semi-rapping (it was still good though) with Fetty Wap, whom I like out of a lot of rappers I just don't care for. Asking 4 It was a good song, and I enjoyed it.\n* Her song Naughty. It had just the right theatrics, and it went along with this great, Empire-esque, beat. At least that's what it made me think of. There's this rap feeling that hovers over the album, much more heavily than Gwen Stefani's other works, and I can't say that it's a bad thing. I liked this song, because it wasn't something I was expecting. It even had this feeling of Soul to it. I don't know if \"feeling\" is the right word, I just can't think of another one.\n* Misery, You're My Favorite, Where Would I Be?, Make Me Like You, Rare.\n\nSo, overall, the album could've been better. But it does have a good few tunes. I still love Gwen Stefani's music, but I am not screaming at the top of my lungs for her next album. 3 stars overall.","classification":3,"fold":1}
