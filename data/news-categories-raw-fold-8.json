The dark, disturbing images sparked the soul-searching coast-to-coast conversation this issue deserves. In the two days after the video's release, calls to the National Domestic Abuse Hotline shot up 84 percent. And while some shamefully implied that victims who stay in abusive relationships are somehow culpable for their abuse, the hashtag #WhyIStayed, begun by Beverly Gooden, provided a harrowing array of deeply poignant answers. Though questions remain about what NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell knew and when he knew it, it's clear this issue goes far beyond the NFL. Ray Rice is just the tip of the iceberg -- beneath it lies a culture and legal system that perpetuates this kind of violence in millions of cases that we never see.","classification":"POLITICS","fold":8}

As many tried to explain away Trump's reckless, racist extremism, a few put principle over party. The wife of former Republican Senator Bob Bennett, who died on May 4, revealed that her husband spent his dying hours reaching out to Muslims. \"He would go to people with the hijab [on] and tell them he was glad they were in America,\" she told the Daily Beast. \"He wanted to apologize on behalf of the Republican Party.\" In the U.K., Prime Minister David Cameron called Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., \"divisive, stupid and wrong.\" Trump's reply was that he didn't think he and Cameron would \"have a very good relationship.\" The press is also doing its part to whitewash extremism. The New York Times called Trump's racism \"a reductive approach to ethnicity,\" and said Trump's attitude toward women is \"complex\" and \"defies simple categorization,\" as if sexism is suddenly as complicated as string theory. Not everybody's going along. Bob Garfield, co-host of \"On the Media,\" warned the press of the danger of normalizing Trump. \"Every interview with Donald Trump, every single one should hold him accountable for bigotry, incitement, juvenile conduct and blithe contempt for the Constitution,\" he said. \"The voters will do what the voters will do, but it must not be, cannot be because the press did not do enough.\"","classification":"POLITICS","fold":8}

In our era of globalization, national regulation is far less effective than continental regulation, which protects consumers from monopolies and unfair practices. From energy to roaming charges, the EU can regulate imperfect matters more effectively than national bodies ever could. In financial markets, the EU has been at the forefront of better regulation to prevent another crisis: from limits on bonuses to the European Central Bank's banking union, we are building a more resilient banking system to protect both depositors and taxpayers alike. Meanwhile the European single market is the key achievement of the Union that has improved standards of living for citizens in every single member state. Today, it provides a strong incentive for countries in the Union to support each other, a truth born out during the financial crisis.","classification":"WORLDPOST","fold":8}

This is our real deficit crisis, and one that, unlike the more commonly discussed deficit, is actually getting worse. In fact, researchers have given this crisis a name: \"time famine.\" And feeling like you're experiencing a time famine has very real consequences, including increased stress and diminished satisfaction with your life. On the flip side, one can enjoy \"time affluence,\" the feeling of having enough time, or even a surplus of time.
