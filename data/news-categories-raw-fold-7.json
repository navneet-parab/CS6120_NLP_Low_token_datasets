But we can keep the champagne on the shelf: we still need an estimated 7 million more jobs to keep up with population growth; if we count those who've dropped out of the labor force, our current unemployment rate would actually be 9.7 percent; and, adjusting for inflation, hourly wages are actually lower now than at the end of the recession. So we may have recovered 9 million jobs, but we seem to have lost all sense of urgency about saving the middle class.  Meanwhile, the swap of Sgt.

Next, Indiana Governor Mike Pence found an even older way to divide, signing into law a bill that would, essentially, legalize anti-gay discrimination.

First, Hubbard has an abysmal track record in economic policy, including the very issues that Romney has made the pillar of his presidential campaign. Second, like Romney, Hubbard refuses to disclose critical information about his income, conflicts of interest, and paid advocacy activities. Third, both in public statements and in my personal experience, Hubbard has been evasive, misleading, and even dishonest when discussing both policy issues and his own conflicts of interest. And last but not least, those conflicts of interest are huge: Hubbard has long advocated policies that Wall Street loves, often without disclosing that he is, in fact, highly paid by Wall Street.","classification":"BUSINESS","fold":7}

Washington is a town fueled by burnout and overwork, and we now know from science the negative impact that approach to life has on decision-making -- which is clearly the main skill a president needs. No one seriously doubts Clinton's brilliance, but the kind of lives we lead govern whether we have access to our wisdom and best judgment.

{"text":"This week the nation came one step closer to giving itself over to the most dangerous and unstable potential leader in U.S. history, as Donald Trump \"humbly\" accepted the Republican presidential nomination - so humbly, in fact, that he went on to claim that \"I alone can fix\" America. It capped a week of nightly disarray - with Trump more than living up to the \"chaos candidate\" title given to him by Jeb Bush. But what shone through the most in his endless and largely shouted speech was fear - fear of immigrants, fear of diversity, fear of the nation America has become. The key refrain was \"again,\" with Trump promising to make America \"strong again,\" \"proud again,\" \"safe again.\" Never mind that America is actually, for instance, very safe - despite recent upticks, crime is still at historic lows. Trump the builder was building a sinister vision of a lost Eden, one that's been taken away by the scary, dangerous Other. And his calls for unity were unity by removal of the other. Trump has rebranded America as a dark, hostile, pessimistic, fearful place. And he only wins by building that place in our minds. But, to paraphrase FDR, we have nothing to fear but the manipulation and cynical nurturing of fear. Trump is, in essence, shorting America. That's his bet. And that's the bet we must reject - not only at the polls but in our minds and hearts.","classification":"POLITICS","fold":7}
