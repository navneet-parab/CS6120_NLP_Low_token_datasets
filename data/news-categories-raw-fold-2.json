{"text":"The first principle of an open society is not to let the intolerant define \"the territory of insult\" -- those areas off limits to criticism or ridicule. But how does one define \"territory\" when media now crosses the boundaries of nations, cultures and civilizations?\n\nIn the end, free societies must defend the right of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists against murder by fanatics, the Sony filmmakers against the North Korean regime and novelists like Salman Rushdie against a fatwa from the ayatollahs. But isn't Pope Francis also right that, in today's diverse and connected world, we must exercise the civil restraint of \"respect\" for the non-fanatic faithful (see the other depiction of the Prophet acceptable among some Muslims on left above), even if we insist on irreverence toward political authority?\n\nFinding an equilibrium amid the frictions and fusions that abound in this global public space will determine whether or not we can forge a new cosmopolitan commons of the 21st century.\n\nThis week, The WorldPost engages this conundrum. Writing from Denmark, Flemming Rose, the Jyllands-Posten editor who commissioned cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad a decade ago that set off riots across the Muslim world, argues against \"the tyranny of silence\" fanatics would impose. Mehdi Hasan says he is \"fed up with free speech fundamentalists\" who feel they have a \"duty to offend.\" (continued)","classification":"WORLDPOST","fold":2}

Less questionable is that our justice system is broken, and in ways that inescapably involve race. On Thursday there was yet another mass shooting, this time in Lafayette, Louisiana. The gunman, despite having a long criminal record, had legally obtained his weapon. Just hours before the shooting, President Obama had said the \"great frustration\" of his presidency was not being able to pass \"common-sense gun safety laws.\" As we move into the election season, it's time to put both of these critical issues on the front burner.

On Monday, a Supreme Court that will likely see multiple appointments from the next president delivered a landmark decision for reproductive rights. On Tuesday, terrorists bombed the Istanbul airport, leaving 42 dead. Right on cue, Donald Trump reminded the world why judgment and stability matter, repeating his call for more torture, saying \"you have to fight fire with fire.\" And so, as the fallout from Brexit continues in the U.K., more Republican officials here are beating the drums for Trexit, separating themselves from the toxic menace that is Trump. Utah Senator Mike Lee said he won't vote for Trump without assurances he won't \"abuse\" the Constitution, and Maine Senator Susan Collins hinted she might vote for Hillary Clinton, while Mitt Romney said he'd vote for his wife before Trump. Meanwhile, Illinois Senator Mark Kirk became the first GOP incumbent to air an anti-Trump ad. As the list of Trexiting elected officials grows, so does the #NeverTrump RNC effort to insert a \"conscience clause\" allowing delegates to vote against a candidate who violates their moral beliefs. As the convention nears, we're finding out whose conscience puts country above party -- and whose does not.","classification":"POLITICS","fold":2}

It was the beginning of a news cycle we know all too well: shock, outrage, calls for sensible guns laws, and then, if past is prologue, nothing. Since the Newtown shootings in 2012, nearly 85,000 Americans have been killed by guns -- yet common sense gun legislation proposed at the time by President Obama continues to languish.

{"text":"A furious war of words was unleashed at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore last weekend. The U.S. and Japan accused China of trying to change the status quo by coercion and intimidation; the Chinese accused Japan and the U.S. of inciting instability with its \"20th century mentality\" of war and conflict. Following up on his comments in Singapore, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  writes in The WorldPost that China ought to abide by the rule of law in the seas of Asia and calls for negotiations.  Recalling the experience of World War II, Shanghai scholar\/entrepreneur Eric X. Li  mocks Abe's pledge in Singapore that the \"new Japanese\" will help their neighbors resist Beijing. The great danger now, writes the Australian scholar Hugh White , is that the ground is being laid for a catastrophic clash since both sides in this conflict assume incorrectly that the other will back down. South Korea's Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se  fears a \"Pandora's box\" is being opened in Asia. Marking the 25 years since the Tiananmen massacre, China scholar Perry Link worries that Xi Jinping is becoming \"a Mao-like strongman.\"(continued)","classification":"WORLDPOST","fold":2}

It remains to be seen if Suu Kyi's elected government will be \"above\" those constraints, as she has boldly asserted. Writing from Yangon, Ma Thida lays out the many issues in the political transition ahead.\n\nHarrison Akins reminds us that the \"shadow\" over Myanmar's democratic turn is the continuing persecution and discrimination against the Muslim Rohingya minority. \n\nIf it stabilizes, Myanmar could have a bright future.

The so called swaps push-out provision, now repealed, required banks to separate their speculative business in derivatives from depository banking covered by government insurance and further protected by the Federal Reserve. The broader budget deal, technically a continuing resolution to keep the government funded through next September, also cut a lot of needed public spending and added several odious riders, including one that raises the ceiling on individual campaign contributions to party committees about tenfold. Had Democrats resolutely opposed the deal, I argued, it would have revealed Republicans as friends of Wall Street and enemies of Main Street -- a useful party differentiation between now and 2016.","classification":"POLITICS","fold":2}
