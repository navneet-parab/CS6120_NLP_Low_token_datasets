But perhaps it sealed the deal for Speaker Paul Ryan, who, after hesitating, endorsed Trump, showing his principles to be worth as much as a Trump U real estate class. Rising to the occasion were Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, who declined to endorse Trump, and former CIA and NSA chief Michael Hayden, who described Trump's rhetoric as \"feeding\" ISIS's recruitment videos. And you don't have to be a genius to see Trump for who he is, but it doesn't hurt. He's \"a demagogue who seems to appeal to the lowest common denominator,\" said Stephen Hawking.

Now righteous populism must face economic, financial and political realities if other European states don't bend Greece's way.\n\nTo keep up with the drama as it evolves over the coming weeks, we've connected WorldPost readers directly to the daily blog of Yanis Varoufakis, the self-described \"erratic Marxist\" who is now Greece's finance minister. Writing from Athens, HuffPost Greece Editorial Director Sophia Papaioannou says Alexis Tsipras' electoral victory will give suffering Greeks \"space and time\" to address their predicament. Former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou argues that the path forward after the election is for a national referendum on a \"Greek plan\" for reform that will bind a now polarized nation. Rena Dourou, a deputy of the victorious Syriza party, notes that the vote was as much against the corruption of the formerly ruling political parties in Greece as it was against austerity.

{"text":"This week saw Iraq teetering on the edge of chaos as militants seized the nation's second largest city, Mosul. It was another reminder that the devastation from one of the biggest blunders in U.S. history continues, as 300,000 Iraqis became refugees this week alone. Incredibly, the war's cheerleaders somehow took the turmoil as vindication that the U.S. should never have left. \"Lindsey Graham and John McCain were right,\" said McCain. But the problem isn't what we did in 2011; it's what we did in 2003. In 2014, we need to stop listening to those who have been wrong on this war again and again.  Back home, Tea Party challenger Dave Brat knocked off House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Though Brat's no-reform stance on immigration played a role in the outcome, more powerful was his anti-Wall Street message, leading Ryan Lizza to dub him \"the Elizabeth Warren of the right.\" For establishment politicians, including Hillary Clinton, it's a message they ignore at their peril.","classification":"POLITICS","fold":1}

With only 37 percent of eligible voters heading to the polls, turnout was the lowest it's been since 1942 -- when voters were understandably distracted. The disconnect between the governed and the government has grown to historic proportions. Why? Perhaps because of the disconnect between a \"recovering\" economy and people's daily lives. This might explain why initiatives increasing the minimum wage were passed by huge margins in all four states where they appeared on the ballot, even as candidates opposing a long-delayed increase at the federal level won. People want change, but they've lost hope in the ability of national leaders to bring it.
