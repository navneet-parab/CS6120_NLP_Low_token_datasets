{"text":"Jonathan Davis used to have a knack for churning out a few popular, radio-friendly songs per album, while filling the rest of the record with raw, weird, demented and torturous sounds that only sound right playing over the speakers of a 19th century British insane asylum (with the occasional rap collaboration). With Korn III: Remember Who You Are, too much of the album contains those other songs that would normally provide padding for classics such as Freak on a Leash and Got the Life. But the best songs on this album fall well short of being the classics that we were hoping for.\n\nThe album starts off with the soft instrumental Uber-Time, which is typical of a Korn album but it ain't a song, meaning we waited three years since Untitled for only ten new tracks. Oildale (Leave Me Alone) does get the album off to a good start, but songs like Fear Is A Place To Live and Lead the Parade you may have to listen to a few times to decide whether or not you like it. In several of these tracks, Korn often starts with a great riff - with perhaps even a decent chorus - but changes courses too often, leaving us in a whirlwind of heavy drumbeats and guitar-shredding strums as Davis makes monkey and lion noises. That's the route Korn and producer Ross Robinson took this album, which is not for everyone.\n\nThe closest song Korn has to a hit on this album is Are You Ready to Live? which was released to the public a couple months before the album came out. And while Are You Ready to Live? isn't a bad song (unless you find Jon's crying to be humorous), it would at best be a late addition to a fan's favorite Korn songs compilation.\n\nFor Korn fans who dislike the songs that get radio airplay, you may actually have a lot to like on this album. Jonathan's voice is as flexible as ever, with his uncanny ability to roar and sing a lullaby in the same verse. This album reminds me of Life Is Peachy, without Twist, Chi, Good God and A.D.I.D.A.S.\n\nFor other Korn fans, the album still belongs in the collection, as they have hardly embarrassed themselves with Remember Who You Are. But word of warning: They're not focused on replicating Thoughtless or Here to Stay. Instead, listen to the album a few times, then add it to the Korn library, and enjoy it only when one of the songs comes up on shuffle mode.","classification":3,"fold":8}

That is the case with the dynamite songs that her sister, Toni Braxton has shown in her voice, and her music dynasty. But f0r Tamar, she had that well with her song Love & War. But for her second single, The One, it isn't as strong as he dynamite she showed with a excellent chemistry from before. For one reason the song was much shorter than what she had before, it could have been a longer song. Second of all, was that it just didn't drive in the way upbeat songs like Toni had shown from You're Makin' Me High and He Wasn't Man Enough were years ago. For Tamar's next song, it should actually better than what The One had shown. It wasn't bad, but for to be the one from her.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"I've never read, or have the desire to read Twilight, but I do know that the series has created a very unhealthy fanboy\/fangirl obsession among people. I also know that at least by the looks of the movie, it has a creepy gothic tone to it, which also creepily seeps into this song. The song, sound wise drifts in and out of modern rock, and a hint of post-hardcore. In either case, it's not very original.\n\nSure, Haley Williams always bring an extra element with her vocals, but there's not much to love here. It's not really something you'd rock out to, sing-along to, and it doesn't strike me as brilliant. I mean, I'd be considered around the target age group, and I just don't get it. Maybe it's because I like my music lighter and sunnier. But overall, this song heavily strikes me as something I don't like, but others might. Whether you're that other, depends on your taste for the dark side, or the twilight, in this case. I also think the song is heavily geared towards fans of the book, which doesn't do people like me much good.\n\nReal Score: 2.5","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"I knew that I was getting something different with this Jewel...and how would that work out?  It is most definitely her beautiful voice and flair for some whimsical and fun lyrics that save this album that is musically not in her tone nor fit her style very well.  I appreciate Jewel trying something new and I also am glad she got it out of her system and didn't find the need to go back to this as this style of music and production doesn't fit her folksy shape and leanings.  A big part of her draw is her earthy, grounded guitar and other natural instrumental sounds; you won't find much of that here.  This synth-pop-techno music strips away some of her soul.  Still, even if the style is beneath her her voice still is as lovely as ever, even beneath and through so much digitization.\n\n1) Stand: it's okay.  Starting us off with Jewel's voice front and center as uninspired, syncopated beats and some buzzes chirp here and there.  \"Reach\" would have been an appropriate title as she is reaching for something different here and this song sets the tone for the album pretty well.\n2) Run 2 U: her lovely,soft voice saves a song without musical importance.\n3) Intuition: Singing twice and three times over her own voice and some fun namedropping in the lyrics with a buzzy chorus lifts this otherwise forgettable piece.\n4) Leave the Lights On: Now here's something that starts off a little more interesting with some brassy woodwinds and a bluesy style.  Unfortunately when Jewel gets to the chorus the song loses steam but this is the most interesting song of the CD so far.\n5) 2 Find U: Weak.\n6) Fragile Heart: A bit slow with a country guitar twang slowly plucked.  Too slow, though.\n7) Doin' Fine: \"We are what everyone wants to be.\"  We are doin' fine.  Buried in the middle of the record the song is rather okay.\n8) 2 Become 1: The music is much more engaging and natural.  This feels like a Jewel song and could be on any one of her albums (minus the way she is \"spells\" the song title...).\n9) Haunted: A seductive and creepy song.  Totally cool and different.  Uh, and kinda sensuous.  Jewel's moaning at the end of the song is...well, let's just say that I'm glad that it doesn't go on too long.\n10) Sweet Temptation: Sounding much more like a Shakira pop song this one actually pretty much works and is much better than any of the first three songs.\n11) Yes U Can: This one might just make you dance.  Again, a love and sex song that is both a joinder and a cautious observation.  It is minorly infectious.\n12) U & Me = Love: Dance pop bubblegum fluff.  Blech.\n13) America: Overly easy political thoughts are dispensed.  It's okay, unless you're tired of hearing popsters and others bagging on America.  Not nearly one of her best social observation songs (probably because it's so politicized).\n14) Becoming: Lyrically well-suited to the empty dance-pop genre, Jewel witnesses her own \"becoming\" with her heart.  Ahhh, isn't that nice.  Maudlin stuff.\n\nAs you might have guessed this isn't my favorite Jewel album.  But there is at least one gem on here and a few other songs that work.  If you're interested in what Jewel has to offer I'd highly suggest starting elsewhere (personally, I'd direct you to \"This Way\") and if you like your techno-dance-pop I'd look somewhere else too.","classification":3,"fold":8}

Stokowski applies lush gaudiness in his three readings, which can be thrilling. Reiner gave us astonishing orchestral virtuosity from the Chicago Sym. and one of Living Stereo's best recordings, a marvel almost fifty years on. beecham delivers a fresh, buoyant readding that comes close to being joyous (though the EMI recording is dated).\n\nTemirkanov certainly has the potential to do something special with Scheherazade, but what we get instead is an all-around straighforward reading, good but not spectacular sound, and some nice expressive touches here and there.

Rondo - Allegro Spiritoso - Nicol Paganini\n\nThe bitrates vary from 193 to 257 kbps, which is fine for me. The total size of the album is 338 MB.\n\nI appreciate Cobra Entertainment and others who release so much fine music at such a good price. If I had to pay regular CD prices for collections like this, I would not have nearly the variety of recordings that I do.\n\nThe only quibble I have is that most of the concertos have only a single movement in this collection, and even though Paganini's Concerto No. 1 is presented in its entirely, it is split up. My preference is to have works (at least concertos) in their entirety and together. But that didn't stop me from buying it.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"So much for the nonsense about the importance of having the right \"connections.\"  It didn't matter that Tommy was the brother of the celebrated tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine.  He still produced no more than a single album and went largely unrecognized, even by the \"general\" jazz public.\n\nAt least he made the most of that one shot.  This album is inspired, kicking, swinging--a mix of original tunes that somehow manage to sound accessible and familiar even if you haven't heard them.  Trombonist Julian Priester and brother Stanley play with equal amounts of passion and precision, but Tommy's no-nonsense, thoughtful and melodic, exquisitely crafted boppish lines are the main attraction.  His articulations are crisp, his range impressive, his tone open and unconcealed.\n\nThe tunes range from basic and bluesy (\"Gunga Din\") to intricate compositions (\"Too Clean\") with tight unisons as well as clearly delineated counterpoint.  It doesn't hurt that Max Roach and Horace Parlan are in the rhythm section, but even so the readings evidence some rehearsal time on the part of the musicians.  The audio is well-balanced with none of the gratuitous boosting of the bass frequencies that marred (sometimes ruined) many recordings that would come in the '70s.  The liner notes are by Nat Hentoff.\n\nI caught Tommy once--with James Moody at Slug's in NYC--and he impressed me even before I knew about the family connection.  If further proof were needed of his singular talent, this album provides it.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Striking a near-perfect balance between grit and sensationalism, it takes viewers through a world marked by violence, double-dealing, and racial division, with an emphasis on the ambiguous morality and personal and familial baggage that come with a life lived between the straight world and the criminal one. The machinations of the characters and the twists of the plot are almost operatic, but the show remains rooted in the harsh realities of gangland.\nComment","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"Past sorrows burden throwing down\nFly like a feather\n\nThis music is weightless and full of inner freedom. It is like the flight of a small multicolored butterfly which flies from one beautiful flower to another on the lush Summer meadow. This music is overflowing with tenderness, compassion and forgiveness. When you listen to this project you realize what a joy to be here on this Earth and you want to stay here as long as possible in harmony and creativity.\n\nIt is not necessary to think how the artist achieves such a perfect sounding and deepest emotional impact of her performance. You just want to listen to the music of Kathryn Kaye and to recover your heart because the compositions of this project possess a strong healing effect.\n\nI would like only to mention in short that \"Heavy as a Feather\" is the second CD of Kathryn Kaye. Like the first album this project was produced by Will Ackerman at his famous Imaginary Road Studios in Windham County, Vermont. And, as it was on the first CD the team of outstanding artists helps Kathryn to record the second one.\n\n\"Heavy as a Feather\" shows the obvious progress of Kathryn Kaye as an acoustic instrumental and new age music performer. The album discovers new facets of her talent. This music appeals to the highest aspirations of your soul. It awakens the yearning for love and beauty.\n\nWhat will you feel when the music of \"Heavy as a Feather\" ends? You just want to live and to create and maybe to listen to this project once again.\n\nSerge Kozlovsky\n[...]","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I have to admit that, at first, I was slightly disappointed that we were getting yet another '77 show as there's so much from that era released already. On top of that, a few weeks before this was announced, an upgrade for this show had popped up into circulation. However, that momentary disappointment quickly passed as this is one of the best shows from 1977. The Dead were actually hired to play the school's Homecoming dance. The show opens with a cool Bertha with Jerry getting in a massive guitar solo before hitting a pumped up Good Lovin'.\n\nStandout versions of Brown-Eyed Women, Cassidy, It Must Have Been The Roses, Sunrise and even New Minglewood Blues follow. Dupree's is a nice rarity although this version is a little sluggish and Jerry forgets a few words here and there. The first set comes to a close with a screaming Let It Grow. The second set begins with Phil's goofy Jones Gang Introduction before getting down to business with a rocking Samson And Delilah->Cold, Rain And Snow. The second set jam has a great run of Playing In The Band->Eyes Of The World->Estimated Prophet->Drums->Iko Iko->Stella Blue->Playing In The Band. The Eyes is fast paced for the era whereas Iko Iko is one of the most laid back. The show ends with a nice Johnny B. Goode.\n\nAs an extra, the third disc is filled with a large chunk of 11-2-77 at the Field House at Seneca College. Other parts of the Seneca show had been used as bonus songs on Dick's Picks 34 which featured the entire 11-5-77 Community War Memorial Auditorium show. Between the two releases, we now have all but four songs released from 11-2-77 as well.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Has there ever been a more prolific songwriter and recording artist than Willie Nelson?  Wikipedia lists his career to this point as having 68 studio albums, 10 live albums, 37 compilation albums and 2 soundtracks.  That's a LOT of music, but somehow Willie keeps making music with a passion many artists never have.\n\nHere on \"To All The Girls...\" we are treated to what has made Willie Nelson great throughout his career.  His signature guitar riffs let you know it's a Willie Nelson song long before you even hear his voice.  And, speaking of his voice, it is truly amazing that it has not really changed much over the years.  He does not sound like a man of 80 years old, his voice still crisp, strong and often velvety as he belts out the songs.\n\nI am not usually a big fan of duet albums as they usually seem forced and that is not the case here.  Willie is joined by some big names like Dolly Parton, Miranda Lambert, Carrie Underwood, Loretta Lynn, Alison Krauss, Mavis Staples, Norah Jones, Shelby Lynne, Emmylou Harris and more.  Each of the 18 tracks stands on its own.\n\nAs is pretty typical of a Willie Nelson disc we run the range here from classic foot stomping upbeat country to jazz ballad and everything in between.  That is one of the things I have always admired about Willie, his willingness to go into different musical directions but still keep a signature sound.\n\nOn \"Always On My Mind,\" which he sings with Carrie Underwood, Willie changes up the phrasing of the song and adds a stronger drum beat than the original version and the end result is truly a spectacular song.  The pairing of Carrie and Willie, with their two opposite styles, just somehow works.\n\n\"No Mas Amor,\" with Alison Krauss, instantly transports the listener south of the border with horns and Spanish guitar.  It's a song that could have been written and recorded 50 years ago but still sounds fresh.\n\nOn \"Grandma's Hands\" Willie and Mavis Staples belt out the blues with Mickey Raphael's harmonica and Willie's guitar front and center.\n\nThe old time country and steel guitar of \"Till The End of the World\" with Shelby Lynne is one of my favorite tracks on the album.  It's a quick 2:02 of magic.\n\nWillie and Emmylou Harris take on Bruce Springsteen's \"Dry Lightning\" and elevate it to a beautiful and sad masterpiece.  It's a song that just sounds like it was meant for Willie to sing.\n\nBuried in the next to last track on the disc Willie and daughter Paula Nelson take Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Have You Ever Seen The Rain\" and turn it into a beautiful heartbreaking song.  Their voices intertwining perfectly.\n\nThe bottom line here is this is a great Willie Nelson record.  It's got everything with great songs, great performances and great female voices that all bring out something different in Willie's performance.  A must buy!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Carly Rae Jepsen's \"Emotion\" is one of the best pop albums by a female artist in a long time. Jepsen has stated that she wrote over 100 songs for this album because she wanted it to be perfect, and she also stated that one of her main inspirations for this album were 80's pop icons such as Cyndi Lauper and Kylie Minogue. And yes, the first single (I Really Like You) is as simple as it gets, it's also as catchy as it gets, and that catchy vibe sets the tone for the whole album.\n\n\"Run Away with Me\" is a near perfect song to start the album. Imagine Cyndi Lauper and Bleachers collaborating on a song. The second track, \"E-Mo-Tion,\" could have been a track from Janet Jackson's \"Control\" or \"Rhythm Nation.\" \"Gimme Love\" sounds like an improved version of Donna Lewis's \"I Love you Always Forever.\"\n\nThe pop bliss doesn't stop there. \"All That\" could be a cousin to Lauper's \"True Colors.\" Two more songs, \"Your Type\" and \"Making the Most of the Night\" are just delightful. \"I Didn't Just Come here to Dance\" could be a Kylie Minogue song. Even down to the deluxe bonus tracks, it's near perfect. \"Love Again: sounds as if it were recorded in 1990, and I mean that in a good way.\n\n\"Emotion\" captures the mood of an era of great pop music...the mid to late 80's, in which Paula Abdul and Taylor Dayne ruled the charts. The music smiles, it is vibrant and catchy. Taylor Swift's \"1989\" features guest rappers and cliche modern day lyrics; it's way more 2014 than it is 1989. \"Emotion\" gets it right, and it is one of the best pop albums to come out in a long time.","classification":5,"fold":8}

I personally like Mrs. Miller but hate Karaoke.\n\nMrs. Miller was the epitome of a loveable housewife singing music with the most non-hip and non-understanding of innocence and that is what makes this album great... She tried so hard and was so diligent and serious.  And the risks she took!  Sure she could have sung opera or inspirational music, and got laughed at far less (actually probably ignored) - - but whether or not her recording career was a joke on HER, the fact that she accepted the challenge to record such unlikely (then) pop and rock and roll material is what made her GREAT.\n\nIn the end, Mrs. Miller was definitely the ED WOOD of vocal-dome period.  Yet as bad as she was, it is so entertaining to hear her sing and share it with other people... for this reason I highly recommend this album...  (P.S.  Its ashame they never filmed her life story and got Shelley Winters to play her !)","classification":5,"fold":8}

Pure rockin' blazin' guitars that leave you satisfied to the utmost.\n\nA Christmas classic, and a true masterpiece from the Trans-Siberian Orchestra.

{"text":"While Beyonce' has had a lot of hits, there are a lot of songs that she has had on her own, and with Destiny's Child that have been less than a entity for your music collection. Diva is definitely one of those lackluster songs. The third single from her 3rd album I Am Sasha Fierce, really fails to ignite a heart and soul appeal to her singnature style. The song is trying to show that she can rap and be the best of both worlds, like Mary J. Blige or Lil' Kim. While it feels she is trying to bring that side out which she borrowed from her husband, Jay-Z, she misses the beat by a longshot. This song is even lower than Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It), and much worse than If I Were A Boy. I hope that the next single from I Am Sasha Fierce feels more like a tiger, than feels timid like a sad pussycat.\n\nSong: D-","classification":2,"fold":8}

{"text":"Yes, we're talking the same Gary Numan who's 80's anthem \"Cars\" everyone knows and probably the best and most underrated album of the year. This isn't really a comeback album. He's been consistently making albums for years now. But with Splinter, it's like Nine Inch Nails put through a kaleidoscope. He hits with usual themes about the loss of love, religion, and soul, but it's never sounded so big or dare I say glorious. The man who practically invented the industrial goth sound has put out a sonic masterpiece including Arabian influences, tender ballads, and intense beats which conclude with an almost symphonic flurry.

NIN has always been somewhat of an experimental outlet for Trent.  Yet even as minimal of a change it is in theory to go instrumental, it's the actual material here that I find so different and so interesting.\n\nFor starters, there is much more of a progression from song to song than on other NIN albums.  Even as an instrumental work this seems more like a concept album than anything else he's ever done.  There's a full range of songs and tones here, almost like an opera or a symphony.  This is truly mesmerizing.\n\nI also enjoyed the fact that so much of this album is more \"mellow\" than what NIN usually does.  It produces something that I feel is almost more accessible than most previous albums.  Anybody who is into Jazz and even people who are into newer classical music could probably get into this.\n\nAnd that's the other thing, the pricing for this is awesome!  Not only is there an MP3 download for only $5 but you can get the whole set on disk for $10.  When you consider what's been going on in the record industry lately this is a breath of fresh air.  Part of that might be because of the specialty nature of this recording.  But I think most people who heard individual tracks wouldn't even know it was NIN.  If anything the appeal is broader for this instrumental set.\n\nYou can download other stuff including a pdf document from the NIN website.  This is a great set that I plan on listening to and studying for a while.\n\nHope you like it as much as I did.\n\nEnjoy!","classification":5,"fold":8}

Who knew?\n\nThis collection of apparently his newer\/older fave songs is bunches of fun.\n1) Paradise  the John Prine song sounds fine  the vocals are near the CCR growl\n2) Never Ending Song  Delaney and Bonnie had a Top 10 hit with this laid back so-called motel shot  John's version is almost exact from the background yelps of the girls. Nice tribute to D\/B!! But, still D\/B's version better..\n3)Garden Party  Rick Nelson's version is the Classic  Don Henley (Eagles) assists on vocals  sounds like karoke  makes Rick's version sound even more important\n4)  Just as Long as You Love Me  A Buck Owens song that John sings as easy as taking a tiger by the tail\n5) Back Home Again  John Denver had a previous life as a folk singer\/w\/ '60s friends  No one would dispute his talent for writing a fine melody\/lyric  John F. found it with this version\n6) I'll be There  a Ray Price rave-up  this song could have been standard on the First Rangers LP  great fun\n7) Change in the Weather  A CCR bonus cut  maybe not  but still a perfect song fitted to \"Bayou Country\"  maybe the best cut on the CD\n8) Moody River  Pat Boone would NEVER be considered an influence.. or maybe John liked Pat's 1961 #1 hit about the dark river death that took his baby's life. This song with it's bumping bass line and the disquiet pain led to John's vocal ability to tell a story\n9) Heavens Just a Sin Away  John's gospel voice pure and sweet.\n10) Fallin' Fallin' Fallin\"  Rockabilly as good as it gets\n11) Haunted House  A fun version of Gene Simmons 1961 hit\n12) When Will I be Loved  Not maybe can compete with the Everly Bros. Linda Ronstadt had a hit w\/this (ugh)  others tried  mostly awful\n  this version with Bruce Springsteen on accompaning vocals id the prize of the CD.\n  This should be released as a single on Country\/Adult Comtempory radio A great hit awaits\n\nJohn Fogerty still records like it is an LP  12 songs  40 mins  get the best","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"We have all heard Michael Jackson sing absolutely wonderfully as a child, young adult and into the man that forever challenged and changed just what good versus Absolutely Great music can be and ultimately should be. On the Destiny album, we hear Michael break it down ever so softly on Push Me Away: \"Don't you know, these dreams I wish could be, the real you & me. I come running back to you, you push me away, you push, you push me away.\" Off The Wall gave us She's Out of My Life and the real tears at the end of the song. I am not sure if it has ever been revealed as to whom the 'she' is that he is referring to, Then, then there came Thriller and MAN!, it is STILL thrilling us! The flow from beginning to end has perfect placement and when we arrive at its conclusion, \"There'll be no darkness tonight, Lady our love will shine (Lighting the night), Just put your trust in my heart and meet me in paradise (Now is the time), Girl, you're every wonder in this world to me, A treasure time won't steal away~So listen to my heart, Lay your body close to mine, Let me fill you with my dreams, I can make you feel alright, And baby through the years gonna love you more each day, So I promise you tonight that you will always be the lady in my life.\" And some people had the nerve to call this dude gay, and I do not mean happy. Another Rod Temperton classic that just shows the boundless ability of his genius, and once Mike was added to the mix, what else can you say? Out of ALL the crooners; Luther, Johnny Gill, El DeBarge, Freddie Jackson, Teddy P., name 'em & I won't blame ya, they all made great music, but Mike made the GREATEST. Vocal range with the dance moves, funny how so many became so critical of him when he was being accused of lies, but even with that, who in their right mind would not want to produce the moves and music he has? Go on, I'll wait. Tick tock, tick tock. You have chosen wisely, grasshopper. Just because he was not alerting society as to whom he was hittin', no matter what colloquialisms you want to use to describe the act and its giver and receiver, (and ladies, please do not try & tell a man what has been defined as the greatest motivational speaker EVER!, how it operates because we have no business trying to tell you what a menstrual is like--maybe a nosebleed--heck, no, surely not!), the best we can do is to take a woman to the fair or a theme park. Mike had a theme park in his BACKYARD!!!!! In Michael's voice, \"Yeah, and after we get off the ferris wheel, I'll sing a few songs for you, and uh, you know, I always wanted a girl just like you, such a P.Y.T. Ooh.\" We can play his music, only he can seduce with it. ~K.I.S.S~","classification":5,"fold":8}

The songs from the soundtrack really don't convey the feeling of the film (a loose spoof of James Bond films) like their first soundtrack did, but who cares as the album stands up on it's own.  The title track may be the most confessional of John Lennon's career, \"Ticket To Ride\" has a slow driving force, \"It's Only Love\" questions feelings and \"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\" is another Lennon gem.  \"Act Naturally\" is Buck Owens song, but it may have well been written for Ringo Starr.  It perfectly captures the essence of Ringo, who gives one of his best vocal performances.

I guess we never forget that first love, I assume they don't go away even after 24 years. I just melted when I knew I loved him, it might have started out as a crush but I never said anything. We were more friends than anything. 1 day out of the blue it was more than a crush. Even after all these years and going seperate ways.... deep down that love is still there.

Their laid back folk sound is a pleasure to listen to. Freckles is a fun song about an adolescent crush which soon turns to jealousy. I highly recommend watching the music video as well. On a side note the name SHEL is derived from the first letter of each of the girls first name. Remember every time you download a song you are casting a vote for an artist. So give back to an artist willing to give away their music, download free music from Amazon and help an artist breakout, download, vote, create a buzz.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Issued in 1980, Cheech & Chong's LET'S MAKE A NEW OPE DEAL (HS 3391) was their sixth of seven comedy albums and the first for WARNER BROS. Records. Audio quality is improved over their ODE LPs, with some nifty studio effects added, but the material isn't as strong as on their '70s releases. Side One is a suite of related tracks.\n\n\"SIDE\" NOTES --\n\nONE -- 1.) Spoof of the George Lucas sci-fi epic opens with un-P.C. fey humor. 2.) Redneck couple can't get served, as she's \"in drag.\" 3.) Multi-tracked bit at a Chinese restaurant. 4.) Mr. Redneck can't order a drink. 5.) Song where hamburgers are a sexual experience.\n\n\"SIDE\" TWO -- 1.) Milwaukee DJ Buzz Wired makes random phone calls, trying to give away some BAM (Bumming Around Money). 2.) The same dummy (\"Bob Btchin\") from 5 years earlier bungles his way through the game and wins with a wrong answer. 3.) Headache sufferer visits a Chinese physician. 4.) Record company exec suffering from a headache is hounded by a pushy, overloud producer, who demos a punk single by Ronny Rump and the Rumptones. 5.)

It was soothing, yes, but also haunting and mystic, hinting at strange mysteries that a younger me couldn't help but fall in love with.  The eerie Celtic-inspired music and the singer's dreamy vocals are entrancing, and weave a vivid picture in one's mind.\n\nI've heard people compare Loreena McKennit to Enya, but in my opinion Enya is more saccharine to the ear.  McKennit isn't afraid to let the slightly darker and more haunting aspects of the music come to the fore, and for that I applaud her.  I'll definitely be keeping an eye (ear?) out for more of her music in the future.","classification":5,"fold":8}

Joseph Trapanese orchestrated Daft Punk's music for 'Tron: Legacy' and was commissioned to compose the music for the TV series 'Tron: Uprising'.  Both scores are similar, having the same driving rhythm and treatment of music themes - it is obvious that the same hand wrote them (Daft Punk's role notwithstanding).  The first 16 tracks of the album are by Mr. Trapanese, and I thoroughly enjoyed them.

It is so ironic that for the final video he did before he died, the world joined in unison to mourn his passing, and that also was irony for Cry from his last studio album, Invincible. While the song never received airplay, I remebered how vivid the video was after his heartbreaking death, seeing people hold hands across the world and in harmony and grief. The song is one of the better songs from Invincible, though never got any airplay, as did You Rock My World, nor its video recieved full attention while he was alive. The song is noble heart and soul from the voice within. Nevertheless, it is one of the overlooked gems from his career that I really recommend as a must for your MP3 collection if you're a die hard Michael jackson buff. It is up there with Man In The Mirror and some of his deeper ballads that've been overshadowed by the imagery of his music videos. Michael's Cry was there, and everyone noticed his goodbye at the very end of his life.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":8}

This may be Placido Domingo's first pop album in more than two decades; but he sounds very much at home singing these songs both solo and with some of the best vocalists around including Harry Connick Jr.; Katherine Jenkins; Zaz; Chris Botti and Megan Hilty. I particularly like the interpretations of these fine popular songs and ballads; and the duets on this CD are exquisite. The sound quality is excellent and even the artwork is nicely done.\n\nThere's not a bad track in the lot here; and that's grand. \"Cancin Para Una Reina (Song for a Queen)\" features Placido Domingo singing this passionately and it makes a great start for the album. \"Sous le Ciel de Paris (Under the Skies of Paris)\" is easy on the ear when Placido and Josh Groban sing it; and \"Time After Time\" charms me with its beauty; I love it! \"Un Uomo Tra la Folla (A Man in the Crowd)\" gets the royal treatment from Placido who sings this with so much heart and soul; and the Jacques Brel classic \"La Chanson des Vieux Amants (The Song of Old Lovers)\" is equally well done.\n\n\"Come What May\" from the movie \"Moulin Rouge\" is another gem; and Domingo's treatment of \"Bsame Mucho\" is clearly one of the best I've ever heard. \"From This Moment On\" has an exceptional musical arrangement and this is one of my favorite duets on this album; Susan Boyle and Placido Domingo do a great job on \"From This Moment On.\" \"Parla Pi Piano\" which was used as \"The Love Theme\" from \"The Godfather\" is absolutely splendid and \"Il Mio Cuore Va - My Heart Will Go On\" from \"Titanic\" couldn't have been done any better. \"Eternally\" again features Placido Domingo squarely in the spotlight where he belongs; and I really like \"Jalousie.\" \"The Girl from Ipanema\" has Placido singing with yet another stunning arrangement and the album ends with Placido Domingo and his son performing the timeless \"What a Wonderful World.\"\n\nPlacido Domingo and his duet partners on this album have truly outdone even themselves; and this is a must-have for their fans. Hopefully Placido and his duet partners here will continue to make contributions to the arts for many years to come! I highly recommend this album.","classification":5,"fold":8}
{"text":"Young MC never quite received his props for his 1989 release of \"Stone Cold Rhymin'\". As far as pop-rap\/crossover hits, nobody did it better than Young. He paved the way for many pop-rap acts to follow, but few possessed the skill that Young had to destroy their competition.\n\nAlthough Young spends about 70% of the album boasting about his skills, there is plenty of traits that makes Young standout from the bunch. He combines some of the most clever, tongue twisting rhymes, backed by an incredible production. Producers Matt Dike, Michael Ross, the Dust Brothers, and engineer Mario Caldato Jr. make this album shine as a fantastic old school rap sensation.\n\n\"I Come Off\" opens the album great. Then comes \"Principal's Office\"; everyone can relate to the subject matter there; great tune. This album also includes the hit \"Bust a Move\". \"Non Stop\", one of my favorites, changes it up with a slower beat. \"Know How\" (produced by the Dust Brothers) is definitely my favorite track on the album, everything about this song is top notch, from the production to the craziest tongue twisting rhymes.\n\nIf you are interested in one of the pioneers in the crossover\/rap genre, look no further. Young MC will satisfy all.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"The Beach Boys scarcely need another review, but it's worth saying that this is an excellent compilation.  Nearly the songs you'll really want are here and it gives a good overview of their career.  There are the early, relatively simple hits about girls, surf and cars when they summed up a generation with the peerless opening line of Fun, Fun, Fun: \"Well, she's got her daddy's car and she's cruised to the hamburger stand now.\"  Then the development of their amazing harmonic style in songs like God Only Knows in the mid-60s to the complex and sometimes extraordinary varied later material including, of course, Good Vibrations.\n\nSome songs have been remastered in stereo.  As an 11-year-old I spent a great deal of pocket money on Sloop John B. and so don't like it messed with, but actually the result is very close to the original and the other remasters are fine, too.  Also, any compilation will include some tracks you could do without and misses out others you would like.  Personally, I really miss 409 and Do You Remember here, but overall I think this is a very good collection indeed.\n\nSo...you can't really go wrong here if you want a good Beach Boys compilation.  Highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Where will it end? Well, I guess I am hoping that it does not end too soon (this richness of music at ridiculously low prices, regularly forthcoming from our friends at the Bach Guild).\n\nThis time we are offered nearly 6 hours of music composed by Franz Liszt (not Lizst as it's currently and incorrectly labeled on Amazon, no doubt making this collection much more difficult to find here than it should be), on 44 tracks, mostly piano solo but with some very nice orchestral performances as well. And the artists represented here are, in at least several cases if not all, top notch.\n\nIt's another great collection, once again offering a very fine selection of music for the newcomer to classical music and Liszt, while still being of great interest to the experienced collector who will be interested in these interpretations (and for 99 cents, why not?).\n\nPerformance and sound quality are very good for all of the tracks that I've listened to so far. If I do come across any notable problems with the collection I will update this review to note.\n\nAnd so, here in some detail is what the set includes, with as many comments regarding each performance as I'm able to find through my detective work across the internet:\n\ntrack ....... description\n\n1-12: Douze tudes d'excution transcendante (Transcendental Etudes), S. 139, in twelve movements (complete) -- Russell Sherman, piano. This recording was made, I believe, in 1973 and is Sherman's most well-known recording and the one that brought him to international recognition. It is overlooked in most current CD guides (like my well-worn 2008 Penguin Guide, for example) in favor of other more highly regarded recordings by pianists such as Claudio Arrau (Penguin, does give top recommendation to Boris Berezovsky, a recording I do not presently own but looks like one well worth checking out:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Etudes-D-Execution-Transcendante\/dp\/B004FLKV86\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Etudes D'Execution Transcendante<\/a>). Back to Sherman, though, after achieving fame (if not fortune) with this recording in 1973, he continued to make Liszt's tudes d'excution transcendante a specialty, performing them in recital and also recording them again in the late 1980's. This is probably a very good performance to have in one's collection for this work, if not the only one a Liszt aficionado will want to have.\n\n13-18: Hungarian Rhapsodies for Orchestra, S. 244, R.106, Nos. 1-6 -- Anatole Fistoulari conducting the Vienna State Opera Orchestra, recorded in May, 1958 at the Musikverein, Vienna. These are the orchestrations arranged by Franz Doppler, with revisions by Liszt (of nos. 2, 5, 6, 9, 12 and 14 of the full suite of 19 Hungarian Rhapsodies composed for piano solo).\n\n-->> Previous Vanguard CD releases for tracks 13-18:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Liszt-6-Hungarian-Rhapsodies\/dp\/B0000023BW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Liszt: 6 Hungarian Rhapsodies<\/a>;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Liszt-Six-Hungarian-Rhapsodies\/dp\/B0000023AP\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Liszt: Six Hungarian Rhapsodies<\/a>\n\n19-24: Reminiscences De Pobert Le Diable \/ Gnomenreigen \/ Mephisto Polka \/ Mephisto Waltz \/ Reminiscences De Don Juan (After Mozart) \/ Waltzes From Gounod's Faust -- Earl Wild, piano. This is the famous 'Demonic Liszt' recording by Earl Wild in 1968. David Hurwitz in ClassicsToday.com says \"possibly the most viciously intense Mephisto Waltz No. 1 ever recorded, along with the fantasies on music from Robert le Diable, Faust, and Don Giovanni, the Mephisto Polka, and Gnomenreigen. It's truly special.\"\n\n-->> Note that tracks 1-12 and 19-24 were earlier released on Vanguard Classics, 2 CDs:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Transcendental-Etudes-Complete\/dp\/B0001CCXBG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Transcendental Etudes Complete<\/a>.

Two selections from the complete set of three suites Annes de plerinage (Years of Pilgrimage), S. 160, S. 161 and S. 163, which altogether comprise 23 individual movements (a further selection from this Annes de plerinage appears on track 35\n\n-->> (I don't see a previous CD release for these two tracks at the moment, but will update when identified)\n\n30-32: Piano Sonata in B Minor, S. 178\n33: Paganini Etude No. 3 in G-Sharp Minor, S. 141, No. 3, \"La Campanella\"\n34: Valse oubliee (Forgotten Waltz) No 1 in F-Sharp Major, S. 215, No. 1\n35: Annes de plerinage, Annees II, S. 158, No. 6, \"Sonetto 123 del Petrarca\"\n36: Transcendental Etude No. 5 in B-Flat Major S. 139, No. 5, \"Feux-follets\"\n37: Transcendental Etude No. 11 in D-Flat Major S. 139, No. 11, \"Harmonies du soir\" -- Jeanne-Marie Darre, piano, for tracks 30-37. I believe these recordings were made in the late 1950's but am unable to determine the dates or venues with confidence. I'm unfamiliar with the recordings made by Jeanne-Marie Darre, the French pianist who died in 1999 at the age of 93. I do note the following comment from the obituary published in the NY Times: \"French pianist whose interpretations of Chopin and Liszt solo works and the Saint-Saens Concertos were admired for their sophistication and interpretive inventiveness\", and \"Her account of the Liszt Sonata in B minor, for example, was unusually slow but also uncommonly rich in lyricism and detail.\" Of her recording of the Sonata, The Independent said (this quote taken from their obituary of her published 5 February 1999): \"Her prime achievement on record is a fascinating portrayal of the Liszt Sonata, which she spins out to 33 minutes, 20 seconds. Darre has placed this complex puzzle under her microscope and dissected its every fragment. She strips the massive work of its usual Faustian rumblings and bombast, giving us the quintessential French Liszt Sonata: slim, linear, and controlled from first note to last. It is an abstract Liszt sonata, and the playing is Flaubertian\". (the last sentence was not in the Independent text but does appear in the book \"The Art of Piano by David Dubal).\n\n38-43: Hungarian Rhapsody, S. 244, R.106, Nos. 15, 3, 2, 13, 8, 17\n44: Czardas obstine, S. 225 -- Alfred Brendel, piano, for tracks 38-43.\n\n-->> previous release on Vanguard Classics for tracks 30-44:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Masterpieces-for-Solo-Piano-1\/dp\/B0000AGWEN\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Masterpieces for Solo Piano 1<\/a>\n-->> previous release on Vanguard Classics for the Brendel recordings, tracks 38-44:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Liszt-Brendel-Hungarian-Rhapsodies\/dp\/B0000023CS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Liszt\/Brendel Hungarian Rhapsodies<\/a>\n\nI also would note that a number of these recordings have been included in releases from Brilliant Classics.\n\nPianist Russell Sherman, featured here in tracks 1-12 and 28-29, has been on the faculty of the New England Conservatory of Music since 1969 and in 1996 published a book of anecdotes and \"dreamily linked observations about the experience of piano playing and a thousand other unexpected subjects\" (from review in The New Yorker and quoted on the cover of the book) available here on Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Piano-Pieces\/dp\/0374525005\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Piano Pieces<\/a>.\n\nA final note to lovers of Liszt's music - at the present time, this Sony box set (25 CDs and 1 DVD) is also available, of course considerably more expensive:  (search for ASIN B004TVVZI2 on Amazon, 'Franz Liszt: Master & Magician'), an excellent and more comprehensive collection, not necessarily to take the place of this Bach Guild release, but more likely to supplement it.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I was excited when Brandon Flowers released his solo debut \"Flamingo\" in 2010 as The Killers are one of my favourite bands. Now, while I wasn't expecting something that sounded like The Killers, I felt the album didn't quite live up to expectations, something Flowers himself has admitted recently in interviews. The album did contain the brilliant \"Playing With Fire\" though.\n\nThe aptly titled \"The Desired Effect\" is a winner with everything we've come to expect from Flowers; Massive hooks? Check. Religious imagery? Check. Big backing vocals? Check. Pop bombast at its best.\n\nThe horn-peppered \"Dreams Come True\" is a widescreen rocker with an almost Country lilt thanks to the female harmonies. Other rockers are the driving Springsteen-style rockabilly \"Diggin' Up The Heart\", and \"Untangled Love\".\n\nThe exultant lead single \"Can't Deny My Love\" recalls Pop music's eighties hey day when dance\/rock\/pop acts like INXS, Johnny Hates Jazz and Cutting Crew ruled, incredibly catchy and groovy with chunky beats, snarling and funky guitars, cryptic lyrics and a chorus so big, only a stadium can contain it. \"I Can Change\" starts off a theatrical ballad perfectly showcasing Flowers' dulcet tones before synths and drums kick in with Pet Shop Boy Neil Tennant on backing vocals and a sample of Bronski Beat's \"Small Town Boy\". Absolutely fantastic.\n\n\"Still Want You\" is a lovely synth-driven ballad with backing vocals that sound like a children's choir (and the chorus \"Crime is on the rise, I still want you, climate change is dead, I still want you, nuclear distress, I still want you, earth is heating up, I still want you, hurricanes and floods, I still want you\"), while \"Between Me And You\" is a gently pulsing ballad with Bruce Hornsby on keyboard, interesting harmonies, and a Springsteen feel - think \"Human Touch\". The horn-peppered \"Lonely Town\" features Danielle Haim (from Haim) and tells a tale of longing set to dizzying synths with an auto tuned bridge, awesome song. \"Never Get You Right\" is a lovely ballad with tribal-sounding beats. Closing is the hymnal ballad \"The Way It's Always Been\" with a lovely Beatles-style bridge and lyrics alluding to the second coming of Christ.\n\nNow, this is more like it.","classification":4,"fold":8}

Even though this album can be streamed free through Amazon Prime I still purchased it to support Bach Guild but also to make sure I have my own copy in case it becomes unavailable some day in the future.  And I would not want to risk losing the ability to listen to it.\n\nI am especially pleased that Piano Concerto 20 is played allegro, which seems to be somewhat rare.  I understand it is insanely difficult to play, but it just sounds so amazing when played quickly.  The performance of it here is great and above average.  I also recommend doing a Youtube search for \"Mozart Piano Concerto 20 Schiff\".  I believe this is as close to how Mozart would have played and conducted it as you will ever hear.  Played at around 135 bpm, the timpani feels like a good kick in the gut, Schiff never misses a note and even his facial expressions and mannerisms add to the performance.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"As a school teacher with nearly four decades of experience under my belt, I frequently will play music (one of my passions) in the classroom. When a student makes a snide remark about a particular piece of music (\"That's terrible!\" \"How can you listen to that garbage!\"), I tell them there is no such thing as bad music. However, I admit, there is music that you do not like. But just because you don't like something, it doesn't make it bad. I don't like opera, raw vegetables, or the smell of anise. It doesn't mean these things are bad; I just don't like them.\n\nI sense this is true for a lot of people when it comes to the music of guitar innovator John Fahey. A lot of people (my wife included) simply don't like his music. I am disappointed, of course. John Fahey is one of the most influential acoustic guitarists of the past fifty years. He has influenced countless guitarists (Leo Kottke, William Ackerman and Michael Hedges to name just a few). His delta blues-based slide work on this classic Christmas tune is wonderful.\n\nI own more than two dozen Fahey albums, and his Christmas albums (CHRISTMAS SOLI is a sampling of all four of his holiday albums) are among my favorites.","classification":5,"fold":8}

Bette doesn't play around with this one.  She sings the song in a simple fashion, letting the listener focus on the words and melody.  Brava Bette.\n\nThis is a beautiful rendition of a classic song.  I love it.  I hope you will too.","classification":5,"fold":8}

This is an exceptional value (as Bach Guild collections usually are), particularly so in this case where all three of these albums were very highly regarded themselves (see the Amazon reviews to each individually for details):\n\n- tracks 1-8 --&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Manitas-De-Plata-at-Carnegie-Hall\/dp\/B0000023FQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Manitas De Plata at Carnegie Hall<\/a>&nbsp;- live performance from the mid 1960's (possibly December, 1965?), awarded \"Grand Prix de Disque, 1968\"\n\n- tracks 9-14 --&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ole\/dp\/B0000023FG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ole<\/a>\n\n- tracks 15-24 --&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Gypsy-Flamenco\/dp\/B0000023EP\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gypsy Flamenco<\/a>\n\nThe Carnegie Hall tracks include audience applause at the end of each piece and capture the atmosphere of the concert very well. The two albums that are included here as tracks 9 through 24 are both exceptional recital performances, the Gypsy Flamenco recording having been recorded in October 1963 and first released in approximately 1965 (see comments appended to this review for further details). I don't have the precise date for the Ole recording but believe it was also released at about the same time.\n\nPerformances on all tracks are by Manitas de Plata, on guitar and singing, and with his cousin Jose Reyes and son Manero Baliardo accompanying him in several of the pieces (these are identified in the Amazon track listings above).\n\nExcellent collection of flamenco guitar from one of the all-time greats!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"16th? studio album from New York band led by Michael Gira:  It's primal, conceptual dark-rock\n  pulled from the most forbidden, dangerous areas of the human soul--a place where Gothic folk,\n  rumbling experimental down-melody and post-industrial demon-breath noise mix with\n  provocative intent and dramatic flourish. There is a power here that can be beautiful, but is not\n  always nice.  Gira can be the bringer of a gigantic, enveloping darkness, with all the mayhem\n  and intense depth of terror that indicates; or he can caress with a portentous paw, strumming\n  chant-like tales of alluringly apocalyptic folk mysticism.  His permeating baritone voice,\n  fascination with the genuinely macabre and unflinching artistic willingness to reach into unknown\n  realms gives an unusual weight to the band's creations and colors the often dense atmosphere\n  with a foggy grey allure.  Band members on this epic double cd\/lp have played with Circus Mort,\n  the Heroine Sheiks, Shearwater, Ministry\/KMFDM.  Guest artists include members of Low, Big\n  Blood, Fire on Fire, Angels Of Light, Mercury Rev, Spacehog, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Akron\/Family\n  and former Swans member Jarboe.  \"The Seer\", like much of life, is not easy, but it can be rewarding","classification":4,"fold":8}

Before buying this collection, I only had \"The Messiah\" in my collection, although I was familiar with most of the works in this collection. The performances in this collection are particularly excellent, for the most part. I really enjoyed Suzuki's \"Messiah,\" which had a surprisingly organic feel to it - probably due to the period instruments being used. There's actually one quick exception to the Messiah's greatness - the Hallelujah Chorus, which is one of the worst versions I have ever heard. It lacked the emotional punch that I'm accustomed to. Otherwise, this is a fine collection at a fantastic price.","classification":4,"fold":8}
{"text":"Talk Talk Talk is the Furs at the height of their game, exhilarating and dense, with one riveting piece of candy-coated trash after another floating out of the speakers. In my own punk heydey, this was killer choice stuff -- even though it's not really punk at all -- and came at a time when doctrinal rigidity to crud like hardcore or straightcore or whatever didn't mean diddly. Talk Talk Talk came out at a time before radio had completed its terrible march to niche segregation, and exciting music was coming at kids from all corners. Punk and new wave stuff led the blast. The Furs were among the best and most disposable at the same time. One quibble with the Amazon reviewer: He takes a crack at what followed this from the Furs, but Forever Now is a very good record that, with the devastating Brechtian nightmare of \"Easy Street\" and sweet metalic joy of \"Yes I Do\" and when they went all mushy on us (\"Heaven,\" \"The Ghost In You\") it was still irresistable.

{"text":"Temples is an up-and-coming indie-rock band from the UK. They have created quite a buzz with their early singles, in particular their very first single \"Shelter Song\" in late 2012. After a couple more singles in 2013, now finally comes the highly anticipated full-length debut album. If you are unfamiliar with the band's sound, think early Beatles-meets-the Byrds-meets-BJM, adjusted for the 21st century.\n\n\"Sun Structures\" (12 tracks; 53 min.) opens with the afore-mentioned \"Shelter Song\" (1st UK single), with one of the more distinctive (if derivative) opening guitar riffs in a long time. Much has been made of singer-guitarist-producer James Bagshaw's love for the 'simple' song structures of Beatles songs, and it reflects in the opening track more than any other song on here. But in a sense, \"Shelter Song\" is a bit misleading as the album quickly becomes denser, with lots of reverb and at times a wall of sound, aided by a generous use of Mellotrons (check the title track). \"Keep In the Dark\" (3rd UK single) is a lighter tune, carried by acoustic guitar (and reminding me of some Oasis songs). \"Mesmerise\" (4th UK single) comes next, and continues in the same vein. By track 7 we get \"Colours to Life\" (2nd UK single), another stand-out song, an up-tempo rocker that is just one of several tracks reminding me in spirit, if not more, of Tame Impala's \"Lonerism\" album from late 2012 (just as Temples were starting, coincidentally). Towards the end of the album, just as the album starts to lag a bit with \"The Guesser\" (the weakest track on here for me) there are 2 more gems, the up-tempo \"Test of Time\", which reminds me of Oasis at its best, and the monster 7 min. \"Sand Dance\", with its Eastern influences and a 3 min. instrumental outro that will blow your mind.\n\nAll in all, \"Sun Structures\" is a fantastic debut album confirming the promise of the early singles, and then some. I know that we are early in the year still, but I'm guessing that this will be a strong contender to make the top of my \"Best Albums of 2014\" list come later this year. If you loved Tame Impala's \"Lonerism\", you will absolutely love \"Sun Structures\" too. Temples will be touring the US in a couple of months and I already have my tickets for when they come here to Ohio in late April. Can't wait for that! Meanwhile, \"Sun Structures\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n*UPDATE* (April '14) I just saw these guys live at a small venue here in Ohio and they brought a blazing 60 min. set, playing mainly from this album, along with 2 songs I didn't recognize (probably B-sides). Their last song before the encore was \"Sand Dance\", sounding even more epic than on the album. Wow, just wow. If you have a chance to see them, DO NOT MISS THEM!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I first heard of this superb hard rock song of through the glass by stone sour around 2006\/2007 when my husband and I were playing around with the radio stations in my 2006 mazda 3 ( I miss that car). Anyhow, through glass by stone sour touches on the vulnerability that a human soul can unintentionally get subjected to when so many people are watching them. However, the lead singer also brilliantly adds a sympathetic angle to the song with the lyrics how does it feel and implying that sometimes easy answers are not always obvious. Overall, a heartfelt and quality hard rock song.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"This is One Direction's first as a 4-piece, following the departure of the yummy Zayn Malik, and final for some time album, before taking a much-needed break (they rolled non-stop since forming, in 2010). 6 years into their career, they are building upon a good foundation, with \"Made in the A.M.\" expanding on the already existing template. The outcome is another great, ambitious pop record. The songwriting is quite remarkable for their genre (on this 1D co-write 9 songs). With an overwhelming sense of levity and fun, and an effortless honesty even on the heartbreaking songs, one cannot help but get caught up in the whole affair. Because, at the end of the day, it is always the songs that matter. New single \"Perfect\", \"Infinity\", with its soaring synths and strings, the '80s-inspired soft-rocker \"What a feeling\", and the tender ballad \"If I could fly\", are some of this new set's strongest tracks. Noone is denying the fact that it is all manufactured and light-hearted, and although the songs are not bringing anything new or claiming originality, there is nothing wrong with that. Expecting some kind of musical masterpiece from 1D, is only laughable. However their achievements so far, are anything but. Boybands are serving a purpose. As long as they hold on to that, and are honest with their audience, they should be acknowledged for it. Sheer proof that talent shows can generate a successful career, and often exciting musical acts as well, 1D have been writing music history, entertaining the whole planet while breaking records along the way. They are a pop phenomenon which deserves praise for consistently producing solid, enjoyable pop. That is exactly what \"Made in the A.M.\" is.","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"This album took me by surprise.  I had no idea it even existed before randomly walking into a record store and running into it.  Needless to say, I had to have it.  This very reasonably-priced box set contains 3 discs.  The first disc is their second greatest hits collection, the second is an impressive collection of remixes, and the third is a disc of sound bites from Enigma mastermind Michael Cretu.  The aim of this compilation seems to be the appeasement of casual Enigma fans, as their prior box set, 15 Years After, was as extraordinary as it was expensive and bulky.  The album's artwork, both inside and out, is identical to that box set.  Pity, because Cretu could've gotten very creative with some original artwork.  Still, it doesn't detract from the quality of this set.\n\nDisc 1 basically consists of all their officially-released singles, save for \"The Eyes of Truth\", \"Hello and Welcome\" and \"The Same Parents\".  Unlike 2001's greatest hits package, LoveSensualityDevotion, this one is ONLY the hits.  The songs are presented chronologically (a rarity nowadays) and in their full radio-edit glory, and for the first time presented as separate and un-joined songs.  Hardcore Enigma fans may be put off by not including the originals, but in my humble opinion, this compilation works well as a showcase of the songs that put Enigma where they are today.  Also missing from this compilation is any semblance of their sixth album, A Posteriori.  However, seeing as there were no official singles from that album, one can see why the canceled single release \"Goodbye Milky Way\" is missing.  One really great aspect of this disc, however, are the songs from the first album, MCMXC a. D.  This album is unique in that three of its four singles were released as remixes rather than the album versions, and I'm glad to say that they are presented as such here.  This includes the sensational \"Orthodox Version\" of the second single, \"Mea Culpa\", which is worth the price of admission alone.  Previously available only in the music video and the CD single for the song (long out of print), it's nice to finally see it on an Enigma compilation.  As the album moves from the first album to the last, it's refreshing to hear how Enigma has evolved.  Five stars for this disc alone.\n\nDisc 2 is a remix collection.  Michael Cretu has always been fond of his remixes, and this time he's done Enigma proud in this respect.  Enigma's last remix compilation was somewhat lacking, but this time around, with the inclusion of post 2001 albums, the collection seems complete.  And this time, it's the last album, Seven Lives Many Faces, that's missing from this disc.  Still, it's a great companion to the hits presented in the first disc.\n\nDisc 3 is called The Lost Ones.  The title is misleading, however, as these eleven untitled songs aren't really songs at all, let alone true Enigma songs.  They're merely ideas, as stated by Cretu in the linear notes.  Each song has sound effect, synth effect or other tidbit, and the rest of the song revolves around that idea.  Cretu states the point of this is to basically see how an idea of a song begins, which may lead to a \"hit song\".  It's a curious choice for a man who once stated he'd never release incomplete or inadequate material, but these sound bites are intriguing.  Some are good, some are bad, but at this point the third disc is just gravy.\n\nOverall, this is a modest little collection from Michael Cretu to the world.  At $24, it's a steal, and well worth a listen for anyone who's already a fan, or for anyone who wants to hear some of the best ambient electronica-infused songs of the last 20 years.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"And I'm the first to give this song a review?  Amazing.\n\nOn the strength of hearing this single once on the radio (with of course no statement as to who sang it) I embarked on a quest to find this singer.  I bought one CD (Hotel Paper by Michelle Branch) which I ended up giving to my daughter - it was good, but sort of ordinary...  My second try netted Wreck of the Day, the right one, and it was worth every bit of effort and two purchases.  This is an awesome song, and every song on the CD is excellent, too.\n\nI just hope my 5 stars lift this track up to where someone else might find it and discover Anna's incredible voice and superior songwriting.\n\nThe chorus for others who may be looking for the right one...\n\n'Cause you can't jump the track\nWe're like cars on a cable\nAnd life's like an hourglass\nGlued to the table\nNo one can find the rewind button, girl\nSo just cradle your head in your hands\nAnd breathe, just breathe","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":".\nAnd I need you more than want you,\nAnd I want you for all time,\nAnd the Wichita lineman is still on the line. - Jimmy Webb\n\nFive MEMORABLE Stars. The immortal golden hit song, Wichita Lineman was written by the legendary composer Jimmy Webb and sung by Grammy-winning singer Glen Campbell. It is one of his biggest hits amid an awesome string of hits that crossed over genres to a wide audience of fans. It is a ballad about a hardworking, pole climbing technician keeping the lines up and working for the customers. The other musicians on the recording included Campbell, session orchestra arranger Al De Lory on piano; Al Casey, James Burton, and Carol Kaye on guitars; with Don Bailey on bass, Jim Gordon on drums and a string section.\n\nIn the performance, Campbell uses his acclaimed distinctive voice, vocal sincerity and role-projection ability, as well as his guitar musicianship. The excellent arrangement of the strings is by pianist De Lory. Built upon a loping beat and backed primarily by guitars and ethereal strings with reeds and a piccolo imitating morse code. In the song, the linemans focus shifts between technicalities and problems of his job, amid his intruding thoughts about a woman that he wants and needs. Actually, Webb wrote the song inspired by driving alongside miles and miles of lines and telephone poles and seeing one solitary lineman technician in the middle of nowhere working on top of a pole, all by himself. Webb was reportedly also inspired by a failed romance. This is yet another great Glen Campbell performance that paints an indelible musical scene. My Highest Recommendation. Five FABULOUS Stars.

{"text":"I've been listening to this album on and off for over a year now, and I just keep coming back to it. It's one of the best recordings of choral music I know. This is quite a remarkable achievement since a pairing up of Mozart and Gabriel Faur&eacute; really shouldn't work. But it does work, and work wonderfully.\n\nMozart's Vesperae Solennes blends into Faur&eacute;'s Requiem so seamlessly that the first few times I listened to the album, I had to check the track listing to make sure whether the Mozart had ended and the Faur&eacute; begun yet.\n\nThey do sound different, don't get me wrong, with over a hundred years between them. But both works, performed beautifully by The Sixteen (the choir) and the Academy of St-Martin-in-the-Fields, radiate a warm tranquility, and this mood carries over seamlessly from one to the other, across a century.\n\nA really great disc, highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":8}

I could see easily see Howard playing the guitar for real R&B vocalists such as Dwele, Eric Roberson or Anthony Hamiltion while Howard played the music. Imagine my surpise when Mr. Howard was the one singing on his debut CD. The album opens with a lush ballad while the rest of the album is a mixtue of different styles ranging from bossa nova, to jazz to even a dabble in big band. While the album is nowhere near as good as Jamie Foxx's first two discs it's miles ahead of anything recorded by Corbin Bleu, Philip Michael Thomas or Don Johnson.","classification":3,"fold":8}

She definetely...does with many, many tracks.  The pitch machine used to define Believe was back at it and roaring this time. \"Different Kind of Love Song\" is so incredibally altered Cher as said \"Its vocoded to death\".

It's sad that someone who the great Madonna models herself after can be ignored.  Living Proof is the greatest album of Cher's career...which is tough to say about a diva with albums such as \"Believe\", \"It's a Mans World\", \"Cher\", \"Heart of Stone\", \"Take Me Home\", and \"Half Breed\".

{"text":"I've always been of the mind state that the term \"ghetto\" is a derogatory word, but Jaheim has taken the word and made it his own. Within his music he celebrates the idea of ghetto, even going insofar as to title his sophomore album \"Still Ghetto\". While I respect Jaheim's allegiance to his roots, sometimes the sheer overload of the \"ghetto\" concept overpowers his musical prowess. Hailing from New Jersey, Jaheim is no doubt a talented singer capable of impressing even the most fickle with his ability. In fact his talent is so strong that it could almost make you angry that he doesn't have material - but images are made for reason and Jaheim has done well with his.\nThe first cut released from \"Still Ghetto\" was the hood anthem \"Fabulous\" whose catchy refrain sung by kids: \"don't hate on us, we're fabulous\", creeps into you head and seeks to take up permanent residence. From the celebratory \"Fabulous\", the album reflects on love with \"Diamond In Da Ruff\". It is on tracks like this as well as the soul-filled and passionate \"Put That Woman First\" that Jaheim shows you the depths and peaks of his voice. Since his debut, he's been compared to the legendary Teddy Pendergrass, a serious compliment that echoes in every part of Jaheim's vocals.\nThe album takes a slight turn with the less impressive \"Me & My B!tch\" and \"Tight Jeans\". While they all in their own way have some sort of appeal - it's here where you pity the subject matter. Jaheim has the voice of someone who should perhaps being singing ballads exclusively, but it often feels like his talent is wasted on sub par material not worthy of his voice. Sure, it's okay to appreciate the female form, but someone with this voice - you just know that he's capable of more. \"Backtight\" might have a dumb title - but it's subtlety is definitely a plus. The songwriting leaves you wanting a little more, but sound-wise it's very nice.\n\"Long As I Live\" is a tad overproduced, but because the vocals are so lush - it's hard to even care. On \"Everywhere I Am\", the crooner calls up the spirit of the older, fatter Luther Vandross (most of you know Luther was a much better singer when he ate Big Macs instead of lettuce). On the track, Jaheim sings out for his late mother and his talent is to be respected on the well-produced and well-sung track. \"Beauty And A Thug\", a duet with Mary J. Blige, tries to be jazzy but ends up just being not so great.\nThings get a little more \"ghetto\" with \"Every Which Way\" which should be discarded in the do not put me on an album pile. \"Special Day\" is another of the moments that make you want to root for Jaheim. His voice has so many beautiful elements to it, that you want people to like him - you want him to succeed and more importantly, you want his record label to hire him better writers and producers.\n- Final Thoughts -\nJahiem might not be a household name yet, but he has undeniable talent that will keep him floating for time to come. He'll definitely have to refine his talents if he wants to reach a broader audience, but for now he's happy being \"Still Ghetto\"","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"These collections are often mixes of the same pieces that have been presented in other low price collections of music on the BIS label. I don't have a lot of these but know that those who do often complain about the duplication. My view on this is that if there are enough new tracks then the packages are usually worth buying.\nIn the case of this Handel release there are some gems that are worth the price of this collection alone. The performance of Handel's Messiah by Masaaki Suzuki and the Bach Collegium of Japan (using authentic instruments)is one example. The tracks included here do not include the opening \"And Without Controversy\" reading from (I Timothy 3 : 16)which often precedes the music in performance,but not always on recordings. It is on the original Suzuki recording though, but I imagine only purists would complain about its absence here when otherwise this is a fine complete performance with both English and Japanese forces (leading at times  to some quaint stresses from the choir) that has been reviewed well elsewhere. Although not the top recommendation it does stand up well, and at this price is certainly worth a place in your collection.\n\nOther favourites in this collection are the Concerti Grosso played by Arte de Suonatori under Martin Gester, a Polish Baroque Orchestra, who give fine performances of four of these Concerti fronm their well-received collection&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Handel-G-Concerto-Grossi-Op-6-Arte-Dei-Suonatori\/dp\/B002WP1JS8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Handel, G.: Concerto Grossi, Op. 6 (Arte Dei Suonatori)<\/a>. These are stylishly played in an authentic manner with authentic instruments.\n\nAnother \"authentic\" group are the London Baroque who, apart from a lovely G minor Trio Sonata are joined by top English baroque soprano Dame Emma Kirkby in Handel's short Salve Regina in G minor from the CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Emma-Kirkby-Handel-Sacred-Cantatas-London-Baroque\/dp\/B00005K2AX\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Emma Kirkby - Handel: Sacred Cantatas \/ London Baroque<\/a>&nbsp;but not, it seems, otherwise available as a download. These are superb performances, thoroughly enjoyable and in good recordings. She is such an expressive sensitive singer (hear her Dido in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Purcell-Dido-And-Aeneas\/dp\/B003X7MI0M\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Purcell: Dido And Aeneas<\/a>&nbsp;and (my favourite)&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Purcell-Dido-And-Aeneas\/dp\/B00119ZA6I\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Purcell: Dido And Aeneas<\/a>.\n\nA second Trio Sonata, (C minor HWV 386a)is offered by Italian Baroque group I Quattro Temperamenti, a sample from their BIS album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Handel-9-German-Arias-Hwv-202-210-Trio-Sonata-In-C-Minor-Hwv-386a\/dp\/B002PQTIVY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Handel: 9 German Arias, Hwv 202-210 \/ Trio Sonata In C Minor, Hwv 386a<\/a>. This is sweetly and stylishly played: harpsichord, cello, violin and recorder.\n\nWe are treated to an Organ Concerto and an Oboe Concerto as well as a couple extracts from pieces - a single oboe concerto movement played with a very full tone by Jiri Krecji(couldn't we have had the whole concerto?), and a single movement from a keyboard piece suite, this one a sarabande based on the \"La Folia\" motif played on piano by Alisa Bratslavskaya. We hear the full G Minor Oboe concerto payed by Krecji and the Slovak Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Bohdan Warchal in a muscular performance that has character and beauty. I like the oboe tone, rich and clear with great fluidity of style in the faster passages.\n\nThe Organ Concerto (No. 10, Op 7) is played by Harald Feller and the Capella Istrapolitana with Paul Kantschieder, a band well known for some excellent baroque performances on Naxos. This is sensitively played. The opening meditative adagio is an unusual start to a concerto and gets us into a receptive mood for the following movements which then rise to greet the heavens in with some majestic, but not heavy, playing from Herr Feller, a German organist well known for his performances of the German repertoire.\n\nA few Handel favourites are represented here by the \"Arrival of the Queen of Sheba\", The Largo from Xerxes, \"Lascia Ch'io pianga\" from Rinaldo as well as the 3 Suites from the \"Water Music\" and \"The Music for the Royal Fireworks\". These latter are well known in various performances, from the grand style to the more recent \"authentic\" styles. Great music like this can cope with being played differently (just check out the different Messiahs), and it is more often a question of taste rather than which is \"best\" in choosing recordings. What collections like this enable us to do is to  hear different perfomances that we may not have chosen but which can still offer new and enlightening interpretations.\n\nThe \"Water Music\" Suites and the \"Fireworks\" music are played here by the St Petersburg Radio Symphony Orchestra under Stanislav Gorkovenko. From the start I knew I was going to like his Water Music. The the water is deep and has a steady flow, the overture taking us into a collection of movements that are varied and well played. They don't have the sparkle of a Marriner but there is sense of cohesion in the balance of the instruments that may not have been there on a boat on the Thames but suits a recording well. Whilst this is outdoor music it doesn't have to rise above the sounds of boats and waves in our living rooms! Sometimes the performances may seem a bit understated but overall they are enjoyable.\nThe Fireworks Music for me has to compete with Sir Charles Mackerras' performance from the 1960s recorded in the middle of the night with all available players from the London orchestras<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Music-for-the-Royal-Fireworks-Cti-a-Due-Cori\/dp\/B00006L3X4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Music for the Royal Fireworks \/ Cti a Due Cori<\/a>. This, of course is the original version for Wind Orchestra for outdoors performance with  fireworks. Here we have the orchestral version with strings which doesn't have the same wall of wind effect of Mackerras' recording. I found the recording and performance more understated than I would like - but well played with verve and style.\n\nHandel's Largo always goes down well and this performance by Yoshikazu Mela with the Japan Philharmonic comes across as a pleasant addition to this collection - Mela is a countertenor with a pure voice that rises above the orchestra with a rare beauty. He is also represented in the Messiah presented here so we are treated to a real talent. Countertenors vary in their tone, some are true countertenors - men with a true vocal range, others rely on a falsetto style to take their, often tenor, voices into the upper registers - never quite as satisfactory in my opinion. None these days are \"castrati\", for whom some of their repertoire were composed.\n\nAll in all, then, an excellent collection of music played with a mix of authentic and modern instrument bands. At the current price you can't go wrong with this.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"In 1995, Raekwon released, what I feel is still the most popular Wu Tang solo CD today, the infamous \"purple tape\",&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Only-Built-4-Cuban-Linx\/dp\/B000002WU9\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Only Built 4 Cuban Linx<\/a>.  The RZA was able to craft a classic with his production and Raekwon, Ghostface and the rest of The Wu Gambinos took care of the rest.  My favorite tracks included \"Guillotine (Swords)\" w\/Raekwon, Ghostface, Inspectah Deck and GZA, \"Verbal Intercourse\" w\/Nas, \"Criminology\", \"Incarcerated Scarfaces\", \"Wu Gambinos\" and \"Rainy Dayz\".  This CD remained in heavy rotation for awhile and is definitely one of my favorite Wu Tang CDs of all time.  In 1999, Raekwon released&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Immobilarity\/dp\/B000034D0D\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Immobilarity<\/a>.  The lyrics were still there but the CD didn't sound the same without the RZA doing the production.  2003's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Lex-Diamond-Story\/dp\/B0000Z80FM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Lex Diamond Story<\/a>, didn't work for me either.  Raekwon could definitely handle things on Wu Tang Clan CD's as well as CDs from Ghostface, but these last 2 CDs didn't work for me at all.  It was announced as early as 2005 that Raekwon's \"Cuban Linx 2\" would be released on Dr. Dre's, Aftermath Records, and the CD was delayed numerous times.  Finally in 2009, although it wasn't released on Aftermath, Raekwon released \"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx 2\".  He released a single, \"The New Wu\", which was produced by RZA and featured Ghostface and Method Man.  This was definitely a good sign of what was to come from the CD.  \"House Of Flying Daggers\" is produced by the late, great J Dilla and features Inspectah Deck, Ghostface and Method Man.  This song is definitely one of my favorite tracks as the aim is to take it back to the \"Protect Ya Neck\" days and the Dilla track allows them to do that.  \"Cold Outside\", which features Ghostface, will take you back to the classics such as \"Heaven And Hell\", \"Can It Be All So Simple\" and \"Rainy Dayz\". \"Gihad\" will having you laughing because of the story told by Ghostface in his verse and the beat by Necro will definitely have this song in your Top 5 favorites.  Jadakiss and Styles P join in on \"Broken Safety\", which is produced by Scram Jones.  This track, although it's short, will have you think that Raekwon was the 4th member of the LOX. You would think they had been rappin' together for years.  Beanie Sigel shows up on \"Have Mercy\" and this track works as well.  This verse is better than anything I heard on \"The Solution\", which is the last CD that I purchased from Beanie.  \"We Will Rob You\" has Slick Rick on the hook and GZA and Masta KIlla join Raekwon to make this another nice collaboration.  Dr. Dre produces 2 tracks \"Catalina\" which features singer Lyfe Jennings and \"About Me\", which features another former Aftermath artist, Busta Rhymes.  The tracks definitely sound dated but things still end up working in both cases.  The J Dilla produced \"Ason Jones\", is a tribue to ODB and things definitely work well here as you hear heartfelt words from Rae and another Dilla beat that will have you wishing he was still here with us today.\n\nThere isn't too much that I find wrong with this CD.  In my opinion, there are definitely too many interludes and short tracks.  However, because of the quality of the majority of the interludes, most listeners will be able to get past this.  Some of the songs do sound dated, but you have to remember that Raekwon said the album was finished in 2006 originally.  Now one thing that some people will have a problem with is the subject matter that is involved with this CD.  Raekwon is 41 years old and he is still talking about things that he talked about 14 years ago on the original \"Cuban Linx\"  CD.  Some people have no problem with that and some people will want Rae to, even at this age, come up with a new formula.\n\nOverall, this is Raekwon's best solo effort since the \"purple tape\" and it's the best Wu solo effort that I have heard since \"Fishscale\".  You still get nice lyrics from Raekwon, Wu Tang Clan and other artists such as Jadakiss, Styles P and Beanie Sigel.  You also get nice production from RZA, J Dilla, Dr. Dre, Alchemist, Erick Sermon, Marley Marl, Scram Jones and others.  It's not the \"purple tape\", but I still give this a 4.5 rating out of 5.\n\nJames' Top 6\n\n1) The New Wu w\/Ghostface & Method Man\n2) House Of Flying Daggers w\/Ghostface, Inspectah Deck & Method Man\n3) Broken Safety w\/Jadakiss & Styles P\n4) Gihad w\/Ghostface\n5) We Will Rob You w\/GZA, Masta Killa and Slick Rick\n6) Ason Jones\n\nHonorable Mention: (Too many songs to list)","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Released when she was just 16, this is the underrated debut album from the now-legendary Janet Jackson, and while it doesn't bear the signature Jam & Lewis sound that would make undeniable classics out of her Control and Rhythm Nation albums, it's a great album if you like perky, innocent (and somewhat disco-ish) dance pop, and the producers on hand, including Rene Moore and Angela Winbush (aka the soul duo Rene & Angela), give Janet some bouncy, vigorous landscapes to work with, and they seem to be a good match here, especially on \"You'll Never Find (A Love Like Mine).\" Foster Sylvers also serves her well with the infectious grooves of \"Don't Mess Up This Good Thing\" and \"Come Give Your Love To Me.\" Jerry Weaver also works a little magic on the outstanding \"The Magic Is Working,\" and check out \"Love And My Best Friend,\" a tender, impassioned ballad that may be Janet's best sheer vocal performance.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"A solid album but I don't find it to be groundbreaking. It is the type of album that needs to be played multiple times before it grows on you.\n\nOn a somewhat side note, given the dire straights of R&B, I think artists such as Tank need to go big and be more bold...the genre is getting quite stale.  Most R&B artists have been chasing rap artists for so long that they seem to be more like rappers (i.e. Chris Brown (Strip, Look at me know) than singers.","classification":4,"fold":8}
{"text":"After the multiplatinum success of \"Acoustic Soul\", India. Arie comes back (mighty fast, I must add) with her followup \"Voyage To India\". The concocted mask the lady wears wears a bit thin on \"Voyage\" as this album is severely so-so.\nFirst off the production is weaker than on \"Acoustic\" and the lyrics are EXTREMELY clique (written in a pseduo-boho\/ I-love-my-self stance).The songs don't do much for the listener either.\nTired duds like \"Little Things\" and the predictably titled \"God Is Love\" are predictable and shallow attempts to pass for \"deep\" when they come off like Hallmark card messages.\nBland \"folk\"-flavored contemporary R&B follow and lead \"Voyage\" on it's meandering direction. It wouldn't too bad, I suppose, if the songs didn't come off so pre-programmed for an audience. \"Good Man\" is a 'free-spirited' urban radio morsel with second-rate Inyala Vanzant-esque writing. As with a majority of this record.\nFortunately, \"Voyage\" doesn't completely make you fall asleep with dribble. \"The Truth\" wins with some simple-yet-airy guitar parts and a slick but sincere beat but it's second-rate lyrics just make our girl stumble. \"Headed In The Right Direction\" is a wee-bit corny but has a slight Latin-influenced folk flavor and it stands out because Arie actually goes for something different instead of tired \"love yourself\" retreads.\n\nLook, \"Voyage To India\" makes India to be more of a \"Black-girl\" version of bland, \"folk\" pop songbird Jewel than Miss Chapman or Lauryn Hill. And it's need to be said that just because a Black woman's not talking about being \"bootylicious\" or partying or \"her man\" and plays an instrument that doesn't make her deep. India's image is way too formatted and manufactured. Her songs on \"Voyage\" aren't  as introspective or enlighting as she may have intended them to be but rather boring and painfully cliqued most of the time. Not \"deep\".\nIndia. Arie is very talented and deserves to write herself some better songs and challenge both herself and her 'audience'. She COULD be on the same level as a Tracy or a Lauryn but the  bland R&B that dominates this album doesn't do much for both the listener or her.","classification":2,"fold":8}

{"text":"There is no doubt about Jason Mraz this past year. He really showed that he can make more mature songs as a singer, rather than being someone who has been a novelty the past several years on songs like The Remedy and Wordplay. He definitely has shown a lot of depth as a songwriter well with his last single I'm Yours, and now his latest single shows he is not about to be in the spotlight alone. His latest work, Lucky, partnered with Colbie Caillat who scored big last year with bubbly, on his second single from We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things is a very mellow intimate duet. The two of them have good chemistry, but unfortunately, I was a bit dissapointed that the song was a bit short. I honestly thought it could've been longer. It isn't a bad song, but should've had more appeal in time. I do hope though that they could do more good songs together though. Colbie is a very simplistic singer, and Jason has grown nicely.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"Brandy delivers another home run with the overall superb HUMAN. There is nothing incredibly risky or truly innovative on HUMAN, but it is one of those solid R&B albums. It does fall off a bit towards the end and all the dance mixes are not necessary, but overall it flows extremely well.\n\n\"The Definition\" opens the album strongly, if not necessarily exceptionally following the \"Human Intro\".  \"Warm It Up (With Love)\" is an instant hit with the thumping drums and melodious piano to accompany it. Songwriting is strong at this point and continues on with first single, \"Right Here (Departed), a fine track.  \"Piano Man\" is solid too, even if it falls short of the perfection of \"Warm It Up (With Love)\" or \"Right Here (Departed)\".  \"Long Distance\" (following the interlude of the same title) is perhaps the valedictory performance of HUMAN - I have never heard Brandy sound so polished and refined vocally as this chilling performance. Honestly, \"Long Distance\" deserves a nod at the 2010 Grammys for best Female R&B Vocal Performance - that good.\n\n\"Camouflage\" is strong, but has tough competition to follow after the brilliant \"Long Distance\".  \"Torn Down\" is forgettable in comparison to the strongest material, though \"Human\" and \"Shattered Heart\" pick up the slack. \"True\" is enjoyable while \"A Capella (Something's Missing)\" has to be the set's most perplexing listen.  I would not call it a hit, but it is unique and worth a couple of spins if for nothing else but to analyze it. \"1st & Love\" is another clear hit, while \"Fall\" works very well too.  \"Long Distance\" and \"Right Here (Departed)\" are made into dance mixes at the end of the album (take them or leave them!)\n\nOverall HUMAN is a strong effort with minor flaws.  There are no backsteps Brandy has taken from the excellent, underrated Grammy nominated 2004 effort, AFRODISIAC. Vocally, she is stronger here than that album and the production from \"Darkchild\" is top-notch. Overall, HUMAN is \"in the pocket\" as jazz musicians like to say. 4 stars.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"First of all, this is a no-brainer for any Deadhead, especially those fond of the Keith & Donna era. Superb HDCD sound considering the vintage, originally recorded by Owsley \"Bear\" Stanley. Highlights include a \"greatest hits\" first set, a great 20 minute run through \"The Other One\" on Disc 2, and a 31 min. exploratory \"Playing In The Band\" on Disc 3 as part of the five bonus tracks from a show recorded two days earlier in Oklahoma City. I'd be remiss without mentioning the cool B&W-to-color scheme of the digipak (even though it should've been sepia) in keeping with it's inspiration. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you'll never get home... Here's the technical straight poop from the GRATEFUL DEAD site (where it's already SOLD OUT, by the way):\n\nJack Straw may have been from Wichita but the Grateful Dead only played there once and what a show it was! Whether the band knew they would only have one shot to show the \"Doo-dah\" city what they were all about, we just don't know but they sure did nail it. Dick's Picks producer Dick Latvala initially considered this one for release and with a single listen, you'll know why. From the epic 90-minute 16-song first set to super tight ditties from the massively popular Workingman's Dead and American Beauty albums and newly minted Europe '72 classics like \"He's Gone,\" \"Brown-Eyed Women,\" and \"China Cat Sunflower>I Know You Rider,\" you're bound to agree. Lest we forget to mention the great sounding tapes and excellent acoustics at the Century II Convention Hall. (Oh, and as a little bonus, we've thrown in the best of the bunch from Oklahoma City 11\/15\/72!)\n\nMastered in HDCD from the original soundboard recordings produced by Owsley Stanley, with fresh artwork from Tony Millionaire (and his little dog too), and liner notes from original handbill artist and then first-time Grateful Dead concert attendee Gary Houston, this sonic adventure is one to cross off the old bucket list......\n\nCentury II Convention Hall, Wichita, KS (11\/17\/72)\n\nDisc 1\n1.

I think that The Pale Emperor could be the Mechanical Animals of this decade.  This is the bravest *musical* adventure the band went on since... dare I say 1998.  Headbangers should look elsewhere unless they just want good music.  Manson brings out his inner Jim Morrison here.  This album cares less for that mid tempo verse\/heavy chorus layout based around a guitar riff and focuses more on the music other than the distorted guitar.  The music builds up and changes, it feels raw but very well produced.  The album is full of interesting lyrical references, multi-layer vocal tracks doing whispers and different pitched voices singing along to the memorable melodies, rocking swing beats, classic blues style guitar riffs over cinematic atmospherics  with some of the coolest sinister synthesizers since Holy Wood.  A lot of those elements give this album that gothic-blues-rock n' roll vibe that some of the more experimental songs from Eat Me, Drink Me, High End of Low and Born Villain flirted with along with some elements from Holy Wood and The Resident Evil Score.  Which basically  mutated into the beast known as the Pale Emperor.  I have nothing bad to say about this.

{"text":"Here's another Christmas song I haven't heard before.  This is an even-paced happy song, accompanied by mostly acoustical guitars. Very pleasant to listen to and does not overwhelm you with extreme highs and lows. It should put you in a good mood or at least, if you listen to the lyrics, should give you a sense of gratitude in finding that happiness is right under your nose; when you are happy, everything is a little sweeter.\n\nVery enjoyable if you are looking for contemporary music that is just light and doesn't try to \"rock you\" out. Works well in just about any Christmas\/holiday library. Preview is pretty indicative of the entire song and melody.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"There is honestly no question about the legacy Whitney Houston has left behind in the music industry. More than any of today's divas like the product Beyonce' Knowles, Rihanna and Katy Perry. Her voice defined the world in simplicity. Yet, it sadly has been three years since Whitney passed on, but the strength of the stamina of her songs still stand much farther than imagined. Also, with the tragic coma her daughter has been under, it is so sad to think about how heartbroken Whitney would've felt. Still Bobbi Kristina's introduction through Whitney Houston's music was with the song My Love Is Your Love. The song is still a refreshing and joyous song that really brought Whitney out in the forefront at a generation that was interested when really great R&B music was coming into play from acts like TLC, Toni Braxton and others. Wyclef Jean really wrote a beautiful song for Whitney Houston. It is definitely a great download for any die hard Whitney Houston fan young and old, and as always her love will always be your love.\n\nWhitney Houston: 1963-2012 We still will always love you.\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Ride the Lightning is another example of good metal music done by a great metal rock band.  The album itself is just like And Justice and All dealing with death in certain songs like Fade to Black, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and Creeping Death.  The album had a deep impact on me on many songs off the album because at the time I bought it I was dealing with thoughts of death and the Metallica music infulence my release threw my poems I wrote and really help me get threw a dark period in my life.  But the actual music has some amazing metal music within it and deep powerful lyrics in it.  So if your looking for some good thrash metal type music pick this album up and see how many songs off it you enjoy and maybe the album will help you threw a dark period your going threw just like it help me threw mine as I wrote my poems and other items I write.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"This song is supposed to be a summer love song, that's sweet and cute, but let me say, Taylor Swift blows this out of the water, and half-way across Asia. Ironically, the two are doing a duet, which is like Rosie O' Donnell doing a duet with Leona Lewis. Totally mismatched.\n\nAll sarcasm aside, the song has more cheese than Wisconsin, more horrid sounds than a Chinese takeout kitchen, and more annoyingness than Rosanne. Really, whenever I'm forced to listen to this song at the gas station, I want to light a match, and drop it.\n\nBoyce Avenue's cover of the song at least remotely gives it the emotion it was meant for, but it's still a 4-star song at most since Colbie has now joined the ranks of Kid Rock as the worst songwriters in American history. What makes the whole thing worse though is the fact that it's sort of catchy. It's still catchy enough to cause terminal insanity. So in summarizing, don't listen to this song while eating watermelons with seeds, because you'll choke, and don't listen while you're depressed, because you'll kill yourself.

{"text":"I loved this album, it was very catchy and featured a mix of new sounds to music that sounded similar to songs she did in \"Title\". I just loved this album. Here are my reviews of each song.\n1. Watch Me Do-3.5\/5-This song was definitely not the best on the album. It was kind of disappointing when it first came out. It was just very repetitive and I didn't really like it but it grew on me after a while.\n2. Me Too-5\/5- I loved this song so much. It inspires self confidence, which I love. This song is just a song that you can dance too saying \"If I were you I'd wanna be me too\" even my sister, who is not a MT fan said she loved it.\n3. NO-4.5\/5- I like this song a lot! It's catchy and is a feminist anthem and I find it really fun to listen too. I'm a guy and I take no shame in listening to this song.\n4. Better (featuring Yo Gotti)-4\/5- I loved Meghan Trainor's part of this song but Yo Gotti's part was kind of off beat and awkward, he was not needed in all honesty. But this song was really catchy, not really a dance song like the first 3 songs on her album, but catchy.\n5. Hopeless Romantic-4.5\/5-This song is very mellow but it was just very nice to listen too. I loved this song because it is a song you can just chill to. The lyrics were very wonderful and the instrumentals are amazing\n6. I Love Me (with Lunchmoney Lewis)-4.5\/5- This song, like \"Me Too\" is a song about self confidence and I feel Lunchmoney Lewis was perfect for this song, the two just worked together. Very catchy and a song you can easily remember and sing along too\n7. Kindly Calm Me Down-5\/5- I loved this song so much, it wasn't a dance song but lyrically it was amazing and the beat was amazing along with the vocals. One of my favorites on the whole album!\n8. Woman Up-4\/5-Not the best on the album but it was definitely catchy. This was another feminist album and I found it very good! Pretty solid song overall!\n9. Just A Friend To You-5\/5-Amazing. Reminds me of her songs from \"Title\" and I love the ukulele and violin background. The lyrics are amazing and it just sounds amazing.\n10. I Wont Let You Down-4.5\/5- Very good song! It's catchy and the beat is spectacular! The vocals and lyrics are also very good! Solid song, I think it may be a single but it most likely will not be.\n11. Dance Like Yo Daddy-4\/5-Great song but not the best. The best is ok and so are the lyrics. The vocals are amazing though! Most likely will not be a single though. But still a song you can jam too.\n12. Champagne Problems-5\/5-The best song on the album in my opinion. The vocals are supreme along with the lyrics and the beat. It's realistic from your Uber being late to your WiFi not working. Just amazing! I recommend buying this song if not the album.\n\nOverall:Spectacular album from Meghan. Just amazing! I was not disappointed by this album at all. In fact, I was VERY impressed! This album just shines. I believe it is much better than \"Title\" and it's just supreme. 5\/5","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I eagerly bought and listened to Dierks Bentley's first three albums.  They were different than everything else on the radio; true, he was pretty much following the formula set down by Waylon Jennings (and even lifted a few of Waylon's rhythms), but it was still a nice change from the regular mainstream pace.  And then Bentley kind of petered out; MODERN DAY DRIFTER and LONG TRIP ALONE just weren't as good as his debut, even if they featured a handful of amazing songs.\n\nThat's why I didn't really pay attention when Bentley released a new album (I completely ignored his last couple).  Yet, when I began listening to the tracks and discovered that it was a bluegrass album, I bought it.  I'm all for mainstream singers cutting loose Nashville's chains and doing what they want (I'm waiting for the day Toby Keith decides to give radio the finger...still waiting...I should probably give up...).  UP ON THE RIDGE is, at its heart, a bluegrass concept album, filled with minor-key songs about love and life.  Some have decidedly upbeat lyrics (\"Fiddlin' Around\"), and some use up-tempo melodies to convey not-so-happy lyrics (\"You're Dead to Me\" and \"Bad Angel\").  Yet this is not a feel-good album; it's an album by a man not quite happy with his musical surroundings (Bentley hasn't had a genuine hit in a few years, I don't think), who has decided to play outside radio.  RIDGE won't have much radio success; in this day and age of hick anthems, blindly patriotic lyrics, and bubblegum pop sensibilities, country music has turned its bearded cheek to bluegrass.  So be it; quite a few of us don't even bother turning the radio on anymore (God bless satellite radio, though).\n\nBentley is joined by a few compatriots, notably from outside mainstream country: Del McCoury, Chris Thile, the Punch Brothers, Jamey Johnson, Miranda Lambert, Kris Kristofferson, Vince Gill, and producer\/songwriter Jon Randall.  Some of the material here is top notch: Bentley shines on Kristofferson's darkly humorous \"From the Battle to the Bottom,\" even if he doesn't capture the original's whimsy (and Kristofferson, unfortunately, is not in top form voice-wise, though he's still a welcome addition); \"Down in the Mine\" is a hauntingly beautiful tune; \"Bad Angel\" features engaging performances by Lambert and Johnson, two of the few reasons to actually listen to contemporary country music.  Some other songs are solid, if not among Bentley's best, and while Bob Dylan's \"Senor\" is a wonderful skeptic's tune, it doesn't quite fit Bentley or the album (it's more Chris Thile's territory, which is probably why he sings on it).\n\nOverall, UP ON THE RIDGE is a solid album from a man who's finally doing what he wants (again; I still say his debut album was a fine example of classic-style country music).  It won't sell as well as his previous records, and it won't overwhelm radio with any hits, and casual fans who expect the usual mainstream affair will be turned off.  But those of us who appreciate high-caliber music with genuine soul, music that comes from an old, deep place that is never mined out, will rejoice at the album.  It's not a classic, and it has its weak spots, but it's still a fine return to form for Dierks Bentley, who's still one of the more promising country artists out there.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"With three decades of music under her belt, Amy Grant has already produced two best of collections.  And while they are both great, there was no place to find a sample of her entire career.  Until now.\n\nThis disc is an attempt to collect the hits from Amy's entire career, and it does a remarkable good job.  With just nineteen songs, it hits all the highlights.  It includes \"Simple Things,\" the title track from her last major studio release and \"Old Man's Rubble\" from her self title debut.  In fact, it includes at least one song from each of her major studio releases (not counting the hymns projects or the Christmas releases) except for her third, \"Never Alone.\"  Heck, it even includes \"Stay for Awhile.\"  That song originated on Collection and went on to become a hit in its own right.\n\nAnd there are plenty of classics here, from \"Baby Baby\" and \"Saved by Love\" to \"Thy Word,\" \"El Shaddai,\" and \"Father's Eyes.\"\n\nHaving said that, there are some drawbacks.  Fans who already own all her releases will find absolutely nothing new here.  All nineteen tracks have been previous released.  While they have been digitally remastered to sound better, I must admit I don't notice the difference.  Of course, when you are getting almost an hour and twenty minutes of music, this is being picky.\n\nAn equally picky point is the over representation of \"Heart in Motion.\"  I know it was her biggest release by far.  But it gets five tracks, which is about a quarter of the disc space.  And, to be honest, it's not my favorite of her releases.  Seems like one or two could have been cut to include a song from somewhere else.  Frankly, I'm a little surprised that \"Sing Your Praise to the Lord\" didn't make the cut.  That would have been a good switch.\n\nFinally, there's the timing.  Amy's last two releases have been a greatest hits and a live disc.  I know she just changed record labels, but I would have preferred to see this after another studio release.\n\nIn reality, these are all minor quibbles.  Any fan of Amy's music will find lots of memories in these nineteen songs and be glad to have them all in one place.","classification":5,"fold":8}

A fantastic affirmation 'break up' song, the vocalist is in the process of quietly, calmly, and firmly throwing her love interest out of her life. The man in question, who has been untrue, is blustering loudly that no one can ever replace him in her life, and that she is making a big mistake, and she retorts that he is so foolish that he can't even recognize that SHE is the irreplaceable one, not he. Perfect for anyone who's ever had a painfully similar choice to make.\n\nLike all Amazon MP3 downloads, this MP3 is DRM-free and plays beautifully, without fuss on my MP3 player.\n\n~ Ana Mardoll","classification":5,"fold":8}

I think this song encapsulates the theme of the movie, which is about brave college kids competing in a song competition.  Ester Dean has such a soulful powerful voice.  Anna Kendrick sings the hit song \"Cups\" in a campfire scene in the movie..  She is accompanied by the equally talented Rebel Wilson and the rest of the Bardem Bella's.  I love all the songs included in the medleys on the soundtrack.  I especially enjoy the songs \"Wrecking Ball\" and \"We Belong\" and \"Run The World\".  These songs may be targeted for young women, but these tunes are so upbeat they appeal to anyone.  Adam Devine sings an entertaining version of \"All of Me\".  His version is not as touching as the one done by John Legend, but it is still enjoyable to listen to.  Pitch Perfect 2 is the one of the best soundtracks in a long time.  All of the songs are superb.","classification":5,"fold":8}

So when word came out she was going to make a project with Babyface, as a duet record, the question would be could they both deliver brilliantly. While it has been 20 years since Give U My Heart came out from the Boomerang Soundtrack, which launched Toni Braxton's legacy, they both have had a lot to prove in song. Well, Hurt You, the lead single from their duet record Love, Marriage & Divorce wasn't actually a driven song. They had the heart, but more could've been done to drive into the song. Hopefully, the next duet they both really do can be better in voice and heart than this was. Not a bad song, but more drive in heart to the song.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"Old Crow Medicine Show's hiatus didn't last long: announcing the break around August 2011 only for it to be concluded by December 2011.  The hiatus came with change though -- founding member Willie Watson and mandolist Cory Younts parted ways with the band, and founding member Chris Fuqua rejoined for recording.  Even though the member lineup may have changed, the band's sound for CARRY ME BACK stayed largely the same (Willie is featured on many of these tracks).\n\nMarked with stand-up bass, fiddles, mandolins, and acoustic guitars, Old Crow Medicine Show has a very old-timey sound.  The band pulls the sound off well, pleasing both fans of folk and bluegrass.  Opening and title track \"Carry Me Back\" is a brisk, bluegrass tune that is both a great way to start the album and good message-statement to the world.  The album follows the pace set by this title track: CARRY ME BACK stays upbeat, and its brisk pace makes the album over before you even know it.  That's not too say the album feels too brief (the album is 37:01) -- it just feels like a bunch of friends having a good time.  When the band slows its pacing for a few songs, it's to good effect (\"Genevieve\" and \"Ways of Man.\")  While the band feels somewhat anachronistic in the modern day, they do a good job sounding like authentic pre-World War II musicians.\n\nCARRY ME BACK will please both newcomers to the band and longtime listeners.  Fans of the folk-based sides of Mumford and Sons, Trampled by Turtles, and the Avett Brothers might enjoy what Old Crow Medicine Show has to offer.  This album also marks a good place to start listening to the band -- even though the music is very niche, it's very accessible.  However, if you weren't convinced by the band's past work, this album won't change your mind.  Standout tracks to sample\/download: \"Carry Me Back,\" \"We Don't Grow Tobacco,\" and \"Genevieve.\"  Although past efforts might be a bit more consistent (like O.C.M.S.), CARRY ME BACK is a great entry to the band's discography.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Clint Black arrived on the country charts in 1989, the same year Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson, and Travis Tritt released debut albums.  Black's Killin' Time initially established him as the biggest of the new stars, with hits like \"A Better Man,\" \"Nobody's Home,\" and the title track.\n These songs showcased Black's clever wordplay amid fairly traditional honky tonk arrangements and a Haggardesque vocal style. While it wasn't long before Black was surpassed commercially by Brooks and Jackson, his music maintained a high standard during his RCA tenure that was highlighted by 29 top ten hits.\n Black's two Greatest Hits volumes were both frustrating affairs whose new material - aside from the haunting chart-topper \"Like The Rain\" - was subpar.  This chronologically arranged, 20-track collection concentrates on his biggest chart hits, including the lush \"Loving Blind\" and the heartbreaking \"Where Are You Now\" (number ones inexplicably left off those other sets).\n The only non-single found here is the jazzy Bruce Hornsby duet \"Dixie Lullaby.\"  As it sounds a lot like the enclosed Steve Wariner pairing \"Been There\" (which it precedes), its selection is suspect.  Had the compilers included \"When I Said I Do\" - Black's award winning, # 1 collaboration with wife Lisa Hartman - instead, this retrospective might have merited its Ultimate title.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"In my opinion, this is Bing Crosby's best Christmas Classic: \"Do You Hear What I Hear?\"  It has survived the test of time, celebrating the 50th anniversary of its release this year.  It is also one of a dozen of Bing's first STEREO Christmas songs, and it sounds great.  I enjoy Bing's version of this song better than any other artist, and this song even more than his signature song, \"White Christmas\".  Bing was one of the first two artists to present this song to the public, and he left a great lasting impression of \"Do You Hear What I Hear\".  A couple of other not as popular Bing Crosby Christmas songs to look-up are: \"I Sing Noel\", \"The Littlest Angel\", \"And the Bells Rang\", \"Round and Round the Christmas Tree\" and a duet with Frank Sinatra called \"We Wish You the Merriest\". Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all.  May this season bring us peace, goodness, light and life.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"\"Born Again\" is Australian Christian Rock group Newsboys first CD since their new vocalist Michael Tait joined, and immediately it is evident the group sounds more like his alma mater dc Talk, or even Tait. No bad thing if you loved the sound of those acts, but I can't help feeling this doesn't sound much like Newsboys.\n\nStill, it is a good album. Opening is the title track, a quivering rocker which is very catchy and one of my favourites. Other upbeat songs of that ilk are \"One shot\" (which name checks twitter and facebook), \"Way beyond myself\" (which has a Trancey dance feel), the catchy \"When the boys light up\" (sounding like something by Tait's former band mate Toby Mac), the frenetic rocker \"Escape\", and the bouncy Glam rock \"Miracles\". The band cover \"Jesus Freak\" which I find redundant as it is almost a note for note copy of the dc Talk original but lacking in the punch that packed when first heard back in 1995.\n\nThe rest of the album comprises mid-tempo songs or ballads; \"Impossible\", the anthemic restoration ballad \"Build us back\", \"Running to you\" (another of my favourites), the jangly \"On your knees\" (\"When you lose hope, all you have to do is get on your knees again\"), and \"Mighty to save\", a cover of a Hillsong song.\n\nThere isn't any bad cut among these, but also nothing spectacular either, my favourites notwithstanding. None of the quirky fun Pop present on albums like \"Going public\" or \"Take me to your leader\". I hope they take more musical risks next time and create a stronger identity for themselves rather than sounding like dc Talk\/Tait clones. A newcomer to Newsboys may love this though. 3 and a half stars really!","classification":3,"fold":8}

For THE HUNTER, Mike Elizondo gave the songs a bright, crisp pop-metal sound.  For ONCE MORE 'ROUND THE SUN, Nick Raskulinecz gives the songs a murkier, alternative rock sound.  OMRTS sounds heavier, partly because of the songs and partly because of the production.\n\nThere's one song that I don't like -- \"The Motherload,\" with drummer Brann Dailor taking a turn at vocals.  The title track is great, with both a sample and a lyric from Thin Lizzy's \"Cowboy Song.\"  The psychedelic flash effect after the title line of the chorus is fantastic!  The first single, \"High Road,\" with its amusing video, didn't impress me at first, but it sounds better and better with repeated spins.\n\n\"Aunt Lisa\" is one of my favorite songs, with the homage to Faith No More's \"Be Aggressive\" at the end.  Some people seem not to get the reference or the humor of the cheerleaders chanting, but I find it a very amusing minor flourish that caps one of the most intense songs on the album.  Then the stretch from there through \"Ember City,\" \"Halloween,\" and the powerful concluding \"Diamond in the Witch House,\" the obligatory guest appearance (lyrics and vocals) of Scott Kelly of Neurosis, is superb, a strong conclusion.\n\nI'm going to venture an analysis of the lyric of \"Aunt Lisa.\"  Clearly the band has alienated some of their fans with the last two albums by moving in a more pop-oriented direction.  It seems to me that the song might be addressed to a death metal fan who finds that nothing else is brutal enough:  \"I don't see the fearsome fright -- all I see is beauty shine.\"  \"I can hear you scream in the sky.\"  The song is punctuated by death metal growling vocals in the background.  \"Nephew do you feel alright?  Always up in overdrive.\"  Then what might be a key line:  \"It was just too small in here -- live out loud!\"  Of course I could be wrong, but I take this song to be a statement that Mastodon refuses to be caged in an extreme metal underground.  \"Hey, ho -- let's @#&*ing go!\" \"Let's get up and rock and roll!\" is not only an FNM tribute, but a statement that life is too short to waste on policing genre boundaries and scowling.\n\nI for one think that&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Leviathan-2004\/dp\/B0002N66FS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Leviathan (2004)<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Blood-Mountain-2006\/dp\/B000GPI2EK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Blood Mountain (2006)<\/a>&nbsp;stand as Mastodon's best, (I give the nod to BLOOD MOUNTAIN), but with their pop turn they remain one of the best rock bands on the planet!\n\n*** *** ***\n10\/8\/14 update\nI initially give OMRTS four stars, but I'm changing my rating to five stars -- with repeated listening, it just gets better and better!","classification":5,"fold":8}

He has the ability to play instruments, he has wide vocal range, and so much of his music is simply timeless. \"Hurricane\" is and will likely always be my favorite of his LPs, but none of them are lackluster. A lot of people love Maxwell so much, but I love Eric Benet just as much as I love Maxwell. Maxwell is no better musically than Eric is.\n\nThe reason this LP is titled \"Lost in Time\" is Eric Benet is paying homage to music of the 1970s. I enjoyed every track. This album's weakest moment is the duet with Eddie Levert called \"Paid.\" I could not get into it though I like both artists. Most of the songs on this album are about relationships. Luckily, most of them speak on the positive side of relationships and I appreciate that. I get sick of hearing about heartbreak and sadness. Love certainly has a happy side. He joins forces with Faith Evans again (they also sang \"Georgy Porgy\" together) on \"Feel Good.\" Eric is telling his woman how good she makes him feels on this track. The album's lead single, \"Sometimes I Cry\" is a splendid record. It is an emotional number as Eric is clearly singing from his heart. I love Eric Benet, but after hearing that track, it motivated me to listen to this entire album at once and I am glad I did.\n\nIf you have read my review, you will know that I am about to encourage you to invest in this LP.

{"text":"I was sent a copy of Abica's third album, Numb, without ever having heard this band's music before.  It took a few listens for me to truly grasp this band, but in the end I found Numb to be a very competent effort from a band that quite plainly has a bright future ahead of them.\n\nThe music teeters between full-on hip-hop\/rap to alternative rap\/rock reminiscent of Limp Bizkit and old Linkin Park.  Layers of synths swirl alongside heavy guitars and drums to create an energetic soundscape that completely carries this album.  The production on the record is top-notch, and some of the best instrumentation I've heard in this genre.  Furthermore, the album has just the right amount of variety to keep it interesting.  At sixteen tracks, you may think it'll be a bit on the long side, but the songs sound different enough that you will never feel the length.  Standout tracks include \"Tell Us Why\", \"The Things You Think I Say\", \"Take This Away\", \"Gave Em A Reason\", \"Never That Far Away\" and \"What You See\".  I must especially single out \"Gave Em A Reason\" as probably the best track on this album.  It's a high-energy thrasher that keeps going till the very end.  On a side-note, from hearing the record I would imagine Abica's live shows to be some of the most energetic and intense around!\n\nUnfortunately, the album does stumble in a few places.  Lyrically, it's hit or miss.  Not that the lyrics are bad, far from it, but they sometimes feel a bit overly simplistic.  It's striking since it's such a stark contrast from the meticulously-crafted music behind them.  A prime example of this is \"Beautiful\", which despite the brilliant backdrop ends up being a rather generic hook-up song.  Another head-scratcher is \"Blurry\", which is an awkward reconstruction of the song \"24\" by Jem (with no mention of original songwriters Jem Griffiths and Justin Griffiths in the linear notes).  It's not a remake, the music, beat and chorus share the same melody with \"24\" but the lyrics are original.  I personally felt the song lacks the punch of Jem's version and ends up the weakest point on the record.  Also, and this isn't really criticism, around two times on the album there is some very melodic singing during the song's bridge.  I would really like to hear more of that!  Not that the rapping and raspy vocals are bad, but the singing just added a little uplift that gave those songs a little more depth.\n\nBut ultimately, Numb's numerous strengths far outweigh its few drawbacks.  Abica has created a strong and robust album that's sure to please fans and invite new ones.  I really enjoy this album, and I definitely look forward to future releases.  I'm anxious to see how this band grows and evolves in the years to come.","classification":4,"fold":8}

I actually have the white version which is reminiscent of the white vinyl version of Soldiers Under Command.\n\nSonically, these records do not disappoint. As with all things analog the bass and lower range voices really stand out in the mix (I actually prefer the sounds here compared to the CD version) and no distortion at higher volumes. My discs were flat with no dishing or warping and while I would have preferred them to be the heavier weight vinyl, the sound quality is amazing  really bringing to life everything that makes these songs so great from the start. No pops or hisses  this is a quality pressing, one I suspect will sell-out quickly.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Sometimes simplicity can go a long way. That is why artists like India. Arie manage to survive and succeed in an industry of overproduction and glitz. Arie returns after bearing her \"Acoustic Soul\" to the world. She is now ready to take us on a \"Voyage To India\" and it's worth taking.\nAlthough the first track'\"Growth,\" is an interlude opening up the second chapter in Arie's anthology, this record, in many senses, is more of a continuation of the previous rather than an evolution of the artist.\nThe only difference is the first single \"Little Things\" which is a track that, surprisingly, does not have any guitars on it, but its lyrics capture the same granola down-to-earth essence as her debut single \"Video.\"\n\"Talk to Her\" is a run-on song. But Arie's way with melodies is best depicted by the mood jam \"Slow Down\" and the uplifting folk ditty \"Beautiful Surprise.\"\nConsidering all aspects Arie brings into her craft, one could say that Arie's sound is a cross between Erykah Badu and Tracy Chapman.\nArie's diverse influences play a role in her distinct sound. As she has stated in her previous album, her influences range from Stevie Wonder to Karen Carpenter.\n\"Get It Together\", a song about maintaining strength when times are rough, captures that with her warm vocals and guitar-lead melody. Then, \"Headed In The Right Direction\" starts out like an '80's Luther Vandross anthem and then wanes towards the end.\nAll songs aside, Arie shines most on \"Can I Walk With You\" - a song about the need to belong. Arie's vocals on this song depict a yearning like no other. This is definitely a gem, if Motown Records had any sense this would be the next single.\n\"Voyage To India\" then meanders into sharp beats on \"The One\" and \"Complicated Melody,\" which is exactly what it says - it doesn't go anywhere. But the fall is cushioned by \"Good Man\" and the bonus track \"Interested,\" which keeps Arie's soulful tradition alive.\nThis album is bound to be a coffee shop favorite.\nIt contains slow jams, simple, yet deep folk numbers and sultry vocals. Although it is a well-rounded album, it sounds more like \"Acoustic Soul 2\" rather than a record with its own unique taste.","classification":4,"fold":8}

TO GET TO YOU contains 5 new songs, with 12 of her hits. The new tracks are pretty good, especially the ballads. Lorrie sounds just like Tammy Wynette when she sings her song \"Another Lonely Song\", great song. The title track is a great ballad about love and devotion, same with \"If I Cry\". Her rendition of \"Angel\" (from a concert) is chilling. \"Whoop-de-do\" is not the best but it's a fun piece of fluff. There's some big hits here too, including \"Good As I Was To You\", \"Go Away\", \"One of Those Nights Tonight\", \"Standing Tall\", \"We Both Walk\", \"Half Enough\", \"By My Side\", \"He Talks To Me\", \"Something In Red\", and more. Overall a pretty solid compilation, and the best one out there right now for Lorrie.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I really like this album. The Secret Sisters seem to sing with a simple joyousness and a delight in the music and their harmonies which is simply irresistible.\n\nThis album has a great mixture of songs (including a Dylan song, Dirty Lie, which I hadn't heard before) in a variety of styles from which are hard to categorize  blues, country rock, early 60s heartbreak songsit's just a really enjoyable mixture.\n\nI found that a lot of songs reminded me of something else I liked  the opener Rattle My Bones echoes Not Fade Away, Let there Be Lonely has snatches of Ebony Eyes in places and so on  and the spirit of The Everlys is never far away. This is just fine, because the Sisters give everything their own treatment and so obviously love what they are singing and the very act of singing together that everything just shines out. They take the music seriously but there's a knowing twinkle in the eye throughout which just makes me smile.\n\nIf you like songs with a slightly late-50s or 60's feel don't hesitate. It's not especially original or ground-breaking music, but it's hugely enjoyable. It is good material performed by two very fine singers with a good band and very well produced to give each song just the right atmosphere. What more could you want? Very warmly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":8}
{"text":"\"Jesus Take The Wheel\" is a good song, not great, but I am now tiring of it after constant replays of the song on radio, on the multiple formats the song apeals to, including country, christian, and others.

When I first heard her song Work from her Anti record, I found that her own work was really a waste of time overall, and not even close to the voice that she could be and is not. Her latest song, Needed Me, follows in the very bad slide in her own work with songs like B&&&& Better Have My Money, and Kiss It Better. Overall, I really found the song to be short, and Rihanna had not been able to sound more like a siren, and instead just crashed and burned in the fire. She also sounded more like she was swearing and not showing more of her vocals. Personally, I did not like the song, and this song is not a must download, even for the hardest-cored Rihanna fans.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":8}

{"text":"They've done Star Wars, Twilight, Lord of the Rings, ... It seems appropriate that the \"greatest movie song of all time\" gets the Piano Guys treatment. This song is one that easily converts to a classical piece. It has all the elements to become a powerful, emotional song. It starts out with an \"island beat\" that sounds like it could be played with a ukulele. Steven's ability to manipulate cellos to get the right sound for the song never ceases to amaze me. And Jon's familiarity with the piano gives the impression he's not only playing the piano, but \"playing\" with it; like a childhood toy. Mid way through, it crescendos and changes key. The arc of the song wraps around again and starts over, but this time the lightness and whimsy is replaced by the full emotion and power that throws the song into the majestic finale.\nThe video is filmed in Hawaii and the first half is right on the beach; the waves, literally, splashing at their heels as they play on the sand, rocks, and even a cliff. (a TPG trademark). The key-change shifts to a ridiculously green valley surrounded by equally green mountains; the planners and (piano) movers making the shift from one location to the other look effortless.\nAs \"overplayed\" as the original can be, I can listen to this version over and over again.\nP. S.  If you are fortunate enough to get a hold of their concert DVD from Public Broadcasting, \"Live at Red Butte Garden\", they perform this song with lyrics sung by the One Voice Childrens Choir. It is beautifully performed and I hope an Mp3 or CD version will be available in the future. Once heard with the choir it is almost missed when heard without. -P. P. S. Bravo to those kids for singing so well that night; it was quite cold and I'm sure it took effort to stand out there in the wind and still keep a smile.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Marvin Sapp provides us with a very traditional version of, What Child Is This?  The acoustic guitar in the background is very pretty, clam, and soothing.  Mr. Sapp has a strong voice that is nice and pleasant.  The background instrumentals echo the middle ages, the period during which the traditional English folksong, \"Green Sleeves,\" was used to change this into a religious song.  The recalling of the middle ages is a very nice touch.\n\nDuring the song the gospel group, Commissioned, is introduced with the phrase, Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioned.  The voices of the choir blend together exceptionally well.  However, the introduction broke the tranquil mood.  I felt like I had been left hanging in the middle of a phrase, and wondered what was being commissioned, and why it was being commissioned.  I finally had to look it up, and discovered that Commissioned is the name of a gospel group.  While it is commendable to publically acknowledge the contributions of the group, the introduction detracts from the strength of the recording.  People have the opportunity to read the song jacket and learn who is singing during the second part of the song.  This is, after all, not a live presentation.  Consequently, although this is a beautiful song, Im deducting a star from the rating.","classification":4,"fold":8}

However, this Laura (as represented in this song) will always be remembered by many lives she touched.

Not only are her songs strong and straight from the soul and heart, but she has much better songs than those wannabe divas like Beyonce' and The Pussycat Dolls. Her latest single, Superwoman, the fourth single from As I Am is absolutely no acception. The song is very heartfelt and delivers a very strong message to woman everywhere, about defying the odds, and proving that you can be aything that you want to be from the heart, unlike the images we've been seeing from Paris Hilton and Ashley Dupree, the foolish and selfish call girl who slept with former New York Governor Elliot Spitzer, that has said the only way you can be a role is by being a bit sexier on the outside. Thankfully, Alicia really proves that theory absolutely wrong, and just being yourself in the heart and soul is really all that should matter, whether it is being a lawyer or doctor or just about being anything. I like the message Alicia delivers, and it should be delivered to woman everywhere as a strong sign that you really can be a superwoman.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":8}

That's what it is. If you are expecting \"Wish You Were Here\" or \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" or even \"Meddle\" you are going to be sorely disappointed.\nI dug \"The Endless River\" alright, though. I played it while I was working and found that it sounded pleasant. There aren't a lot of melodies to keep you coming back, and the one song with vocals, \"Louder Than Words\", is pretty forgettable.\nBut the album does sound like Pink Floyd: all the instruments sound very much like they were played by Richard Wright, Nick Mason, and David Gilmore. And there is something nice about hearing these guys on tape together again. And it's especially nice to see Wright spotlighted as he is here (this record being essentially a eulogy to him). He was a pretty underrated musician and it's nice to hear these songs built around him.\n\"The Endless River\" doesn't need to be anyone's first Pink Floyd experience.

In the Beach House world, the very air shimmers with sparkle-waves that tickle your ears with the subtle soar of musical nirvana.  These are songs to get lost in, stunning worlds to wander through. The beauty and charm here is palpable.  If you don't melt into the winsome essence of theses fairy tale dream-ballads, your soul may be deep-frozen.  Beach House neither seek nor attains much diversity in their soundand why should they?  When your universe basks in the soul of Victoria LeGrands angelic vocals, with an almost subconsciously radiant glow of warm auditory perfection, its a place you want to stay for a while.

I am simply guessing both from hearing the song and the lyrics that the song is literally about someone who is more than eager to meet up with their love interest. So Anxious by Ginuwine is also good to give a listen if you are familiar with his racy Pony song.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"When it has came down to what music has today, it has been more lackluster than anything that is really worth meaning in voice. For Katy Perry she has had a whole lot to prove in music. Following up to her massive success in Teenage Dream, she has tried to ignite into her voice, but her latest single Roar feels more like it is a whimper in song and voice alone, to match her mood. But the song is also a cheater for Katy as well. The song sound too similar to the melody of what Sara Barielles did earlier this year with Brave. I really found the song to not ignite in her feeling of the song. It sounded more like she lost herself in time, trying to hard to make a anthem as brilliant as her mentors, Queen. Maybe she shoule find more to roar about for her next single.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":8}

It's an upbeat and hopeful number that lifts the spirits, with the typical electronic instrumentation we've come to expect of most '80s films but still done quite well.

On the second track \"World Without End,\" Eugene Friesen's cello gives such depth in counterpoint to Heidi's gorgeous piano melody.  \"Eight steps free\" is another delightful track that opens with the lyricon (sounds like a penny whistle to me); it's ethereal and beautiful.  Janis Ian penned \"Tea & Sympathy\" that was on her 1975 album \"Between the Lines\" which transforms under Heidi's touch into a soft lullaby with her gentle vocals hugging the lovely melody.  \"Moondancing\" is a lovely soft piece that is given a major jazz inflection with Premik Russell-Tubbs' saxophone.  \"Beyond the Turning\" works well as a largely new age instrumental offering because of the great variety in instruments, superb musicianship and Heidi's inspired performance.

This is very low key music that has no dramatic sounds with high notes or low notes to deal with, instead, it is a very even tone that I found super soothing and relaxing! And for me, I have found many uses for this recording:\n\n1) Sleep Aid - Because this recording is well over one hour, it is wonderful as a sleep aid because it is plenty long enough and also the sounds a so soothing and relaxing that within 5 minutes, I am off to a sound sleep. (This is saying something as I am an insomniac).\n\n2) Relaxation Aid - What I do is I loop this sound on my laptop or my MP3 player and just let this play and play and soothe and soothe. This particular sound is a great background recording because it is very soft and when I am listening to this on the computer for example, I am able to do my computer work while listening to the outstanding recording.\n\n3) Meditation - This is wonderful for meditation. For me, I lie down and put on an eyeshade and then listen to this. Sometimes, I fall asleep, but many times, it is a meditation.\n\nHighly recommend!","classification":5,"fold":8}

Just last year, I purchased the complete \"Messiah\" contained in this download for $11 on CD. Here, you get that complete \"Messiah\" along with another 200-odd tracks for 99. This set also contains the complete Bach Magnificat and Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker. In addition to these major works, you get some well-known recordings by artists like Alfred Deller, Erich Kunz, the Choir of the Cathedral of St John the Divine in NYC, and organist Anton Heiller.\n\nAs it happens, I had just listened yesterday to those Vanguard CDs of the Somary \"Messiah\" on my home stereo, where it sounded just fantastic. Comparing the MP3s in this download to the CDs, I have to say that the CDs are much better sonically, much better balanced. But the MP3s are OK for what they are, and are more than adequate for casual listening.\n\nIt's to be expected that the musical and recorded quality will vary when you're dealing with 280 tracks, but the good news is that the good-to-great tracks far outnumber the duds in this set.\n\nBuy this. It's less than a buck! If you need to think about it, you're over thinking. IT'S 99!!!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer has always been 1 of my favorite Christmas songs. However there aren't many versions of the song I like. But Burl Ives performance of Rudolph is fantastic. This version is slower and longer than the version from the TV show featured on the Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer soundtrack. But this version is still up tempo and very well sung. Unfortunately too many artists ruin this song by trying to make their renditions too much their own. Dean Martin refers to Rudolph as \"Rudy\" in a few lines of the song and Jewel performs this song in a horribly slow and dragged out manner. Burl Ives sings this song the way it's supposed to be sung and keeps it at that and that's why Burl Ives performances of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer are the best versions of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer that exist.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Meek Mill becomes the latest Maybach Music Group member to release an album, 2012's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Dreams-and-Nightmares-Deluxe-Version-Explicit\/dp\/B009QPLHT8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dreams and Nightmares (Deluxe Version) [Explicit<\/a>]. Throughout the effort, Meek Mill shows off his agile rhymes and ability to craft solid verses.  Sometimes, Meek Mill lacks the innovativeness of his most tuned in contemporaries (Drake and Kid CuDi among them). Dreams and Nightmares is a solid affair, if scattered, lacking in cohesion. Despite this, Dreams and Nightmares ends up being another strong MMG release.\n\n\"Dreams and Nightmares\" finds Meek Mill rapping in a narrative fashion. Tone The Beat Bull provides dramatic production that allows Meek Mill to rap on `autopilot.' The intensity progresses upon the 1:30 mark inciting Meek Mill's vocals to grow louder and more passionate. Perhaps somewhat clunky, it starts things solidly.  Proceeding \"In God We Trust,\" features dark, malicious production (Black Metaphor) proving to be as pointed as Meek Mill's rhymes. Meek Mill continues to tell a story and produces quite an effective, telling hook. \"In God We Trust\" is overall superb.\n\n\"Young and Gettin' It,\" features standout Kirko Bangz  serving as a `crowd pleaser.' Kirko Bangz adds a lift on the smooth vocal hook.  The cut features solid production from  Jahlil Beats and diverts away from Meek Mill's narrative approach in favor of  a topic of `making money.'  It is solid, though solid with the reservation that the cut feels like a `sellout' compared to previous cuts. \"Traumatized,\" produced by Boi-1da, returns Meek Mill to what he does best, more narrative-driven rhymes. Not the most elite cut, \"Traumatized\" is easily above average.\n\n\"Believe It\" featuring Rick Ross is predictable, but also addictive. Money and paraphernalia seem to be the agenda, with Ross referencing `Miley Cyrus' and `Justin Bieber' in relation to drugs. Quite similar to \"So Sophisticated\" from God Forgives, I Don't, \"Believe It\" is quite enjoyable. \"Maybach Curtains\" maybe stronger, playing as Meek Mill's version  \"Maybach Music,\" popularized by Rick Ross. John Legend assists on the soulful hook, while Nas and Rick Ross contribute on respective verses.' \"Maybach Curtains\" is easily one of the Dreams and Nightmares's shining moments.\n\n\"Amen\" proceeds featuring Drake sports a smart Michael McDonald sample (\"Minute By Minute\"). Nearly if not blasphemous,  Meek Mill thanks God \"...for all the pretty women he let into my life\/all the Benjamins you let me count...and letting me ball on these...\" Meek Mill is most sinful on the hook, rapping a sermon in `hood vernacular.' Drake delivers, but Meek Mill locks down \"Amen\" easily.\n\n\"Young Kings\" features soulful production and delivers another solid track with a potent hook. \"Lay Up\" once more features Rick Ross, alongside Wale and Trey Songz, who delivers the lush and sensual hook. The cut is predictable, providing the `sensual' thriller of Dreams and Nightmares. \"Tony Story, Pt. 2 is easily a `mixtape' worthy track that continues to hone in on Meek Mill's narrative approach. Absent of hook, Meek Mill pulls of the unbroken flow of verses well.\n\n\"Who You're Around\" is more notable, featuring Mary J. Blige sounding as soulful and refined as ever on the memorable hook (\"Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down\/but it's okay to keep enemies close\/as long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around...\")  Meek Mill `steps his game up' by slowing his usual agile flow, which helps makes his rapping much easier to discern.  On \"Polo & Shell Tops\" finds Meek Mill in top-notch form.  Arguably the best cut, Meek Mill outdoes himself over Cardiak's exceptional production. \"Polo & Shell Tops\" allows the listeners to step into Meek Mill's world via his biography.\n\n\"Rich & Famous\" features Louie V.  feels more archetypical than not; it could have been omitted. \"Real N**** Come First\" closes the standard version with superb, malicious production from Kenoe and Got Koke. The Deluxe edition sports \"Burn\" featuring Big Sean, the latest single prior to the release. \"Freak Show\" featuring Sam Sneak and 2 Chainz is nothing more than `OK,' potentially making the standard edition the best investment.\n\nOverall, Dreams and Nightmares is a successful, enjoyable album.  It lacks the innovativeness of Kendrick Lamar's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Good-Kid-M-A-A-D-City-Deluxe-Edition\/dp\/B00913P6G0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Good Kid: M.A.A.D City [Deluxe Edition<\/a>] released one week prior and doesn't quite possess the `oomph' of Rick Ross's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/God-Forgives-I-Don-t-Deluxe-Explicit\/dp\/B005ZHBATI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">God Forgives I Don't [Deluxe Explicit<\/a>].

(I even bought it off iTunes like I never do just because it had an extra track for the same money.)\nI hope they come to St. Louis. (Or maybe they have already--I don't get out much...) I don't think there's a weak track--even the extra one.  The whole album is short and sounds a bit like a soundtrack to a French Spaghetti Western set at Syracuse University in 1986(Syracuse University...You got nothing to say...)

{"text":"About a year ago, I bought three albums --the latest album by the Blind Boys of Alabama (wonderful), R. L. Burnside's A Troubled Mind (one of the two best I bought from Fat Possum records --the other was Robert Balfour), and this album.  In other words, I bought three outstanding albums, all at the same time.\n\nSo which one do I listen to most often? The Three Pickers.\n\nI've been a fan of Earl Scruggs for a long time. His albums with Lester Flatt are incomparable. They're the only blue grass albums that compare to jazz in my opinion, like listening to early Louis Armstrong.\n\nI like Ricky Skraggs, mostly for his background work on the Evangeline album, by Emmy Lou Harris. (I don't greatly like the one album I bought by Ricky with his own group.)\n\nI know that Doc Watson is a giant and I love his voice and manner but I've never spent time listening to him, principally because C&W and folk aren't my first thing. I've spent fifty-five years listening to jazz first and classical music second. It's not that easy changing gears.\n\nI bought this album first because Earl Scruggs was on it, second because Ricky and Doc are premiere players, and lastly because it looked pure and unadulterated, just world class performers playing together for fun.\n\nThat's what it is. All three pickers are in good form. They are having fun. It's clear they like being together. All of the songs they play are good, some wondrous.\n\nI like the cuts with Ricky Scraggs' group least, those with the three of the pickers and with Doc and his son most. Doc Watson has a beautiful tenor-baritone voice; he plays fine guitar both in background and solo. Earl Scruggs still plays with the fire and passion he had thirty-five years ago. What technical control he has! Ricky Scraggs is a first rate instrumentalist and very good in ensemble singing, but less successful as a solo vocalist. I wish I liked Ricky's group better --it's good but the cuts with the other groups are better. Alison Krause is on some cuts but doesn't have much to do.\n\nI usually don't like chatter on a music record but here it fits. The love --for the music they are playing and among the three men themselves -- is transparent.  It adds a warm glow to an exceptional record.\n\nDave Keymer\nModsesto CA","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Monolithic Baby! is the sixth full-length Monster Magnet studio album, it sees the New Jersey based stoner band stripping back their sound to the hard rock basics and introduces new members Jim Baglino on bass and Michael Wildwood on drums for the first time.\n\nThe album is absolutely spot-on in terms of quality, the songs are memorable, the production is good and there is an audible enthusiasm to the performance. Monster Magnet, like so many bands, may have a reputation stating that their early stuff is what you want to be listening to and the rest is take-it-or-leave-it, but I assure you that in the case of Monolithic Baby! that is only a stylistic argument, not a qualitative one.\n\nThe aforementioned stripped back sound finds the band concentrating mostly on fundamental and simplistic rock tracks, that eschew whatever elements of psychedelic sounds were found in the bands style from their first few releases as well as no longer exploring many different directions at once, like on the two eclectic albums which preceded this one.\n\nThe fact that there are no surf songs, electronic semi-ballads or drugged out eastern tinged epics could be seen as boring, indicating a lack of variety and an unwillingness to break any new ground. Conversely, it can be viewed as the band concentrating on what they do best, uncomplicated by external factors and delivering only the hard rock, giving only big riffs, gnarly solos and attitude filled vocals.\n\nRegardless of which way you view the change in direction, there are some very great songs on this album, including the (almost) title track `Monolithic' as well as the strong opener `Slut Machine' and the famous and very catchy `Radiation Day.'\n\nMost Monster Magnet fans are fond of Dave's Vocals and lyrics, which are up to their usual high standard on this record, and most fans will be more than happy with this album, the songwriting is of a very high caliber and there are so many rocking songs that this is one of the most direct, focused and in your face records the band have made.\n\nOf course, some Monster Magnet fans don't necessarily dig direct rock songs and therefor could ask for a little more variety from the album, perhaps more crazy effects, longer songs and inclusion of a wider array of instruments. If that describes your feelings in similar situations then maybe give Monolithic Baby! a miss, elsewise do not hesitate to pick up a copy, it really is a very enjoyable record.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"My copy of this powerful live Mahler Sixth is a download, so I can only surmise that tis is the same Mitropoulos reading that appears in the deluxe box set of Mahler broadcasts released by the New York Phil. in 1999: there it is listed as Carnegie Hall. April 10th, 1955.  I share the lead reviewer's enthusiasm, especially because the only other Mitropoulos Sixth in my collection is wretchedly played by the Cologne WDR orchestra.  But I must disagree with the lead reviewer about the precision of this New York performance. The first trumpet barely squeezes out the exposed high note at the beginning (it must be treacherous, since in a live reading by Karajan and the Berliners the first trumpet actually misses the same note). Other mistakes, such as the occasional struggling horns in the finale,  are minor, to my ears at least, and overall the execution is miles ahead of what we heard from Cologne. Like Hermann Scherchen and Jascha Horenstein, Mitropoulos managed to be great and sloppy at the same time.\n\nthe lead reviewer considers the tempo for the andante to be unusually slow, but at 15:02, Mitropoulos's pacing is a minute slower than Bernstein and two minutes slower than Karajan, both on DG. Where he is certainly right, though, is in the spontaneity and intensity of this recording. At his best Mitropoulos was a passionate conductor with a sense of real aliveness, like is protege Bernstein. Yet there is a sense of poise, also, making Bernstein's two readings more impetuous overall. Mitropoulos takes the opening march in the first movement at an almost stately pace, closer to Barbirolli than to those who take Bernstein's cue and drive the beat home with crushing immediacy and threat. The Scherzo is quick and forceful; by contrast Tennstedt is far more harrowing in his recent live reading with the London Phil.  the tendency to underline Mahler's emotional extremes was much less present in Mitropoulos's day, and what seemed biting then is fairly normal now -- which isn't to take away from the spontaneity and excitement of his Scherzo.\n\nIn the finale Mitropoulos doesn't go for the nerve-racking intensity of Bernstein and (especially) Tennstedt, allowing quite a few moments of relaxed rhythm and measured pacing. But it's all in the service of a slow build that finds the right moment to crest in terrifying outcries. Some may feel that however great a performance, the Mahler sixth needs full spectrum stereo. Here we have excellent, well-balanced mono without microphone distortion or a radio producer riding the gain during climaxes (not that noticeably, at least).  I had no trouble finding the version at hand, from the Archipel label, not the one pictured here, quite listenable. I even wonder if this French off-label didn't pirate the NY Phil. source.\n\nAt this moment used copies of the complete Mahler broadcasts sell for $450, so being able to attain a decent-sounding version of tis famous Sixth is a boon. It fully justifies its reputation.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"There aren't many trip hop albums I have bought over the years that has managed to sound fresh every time I throw in the cd into my stereo or listen to it on my iPod. Massive Attack's 1998 classic \"Mezzanine\" is one of those few trip hop albums that still sounds as fresh today as I first heard it almost ten years ago. The music is a sublime mix of hypnotic electronic beats, seductive male and female vocals, and a diverse mix of samples from bands like The Cure.\n\nWhat I love about \"Mezzanine\" so much is that the music is dark and sinister. All the death\/black metal bands in the world cannot create music as richly dense and heavy as \"Mezzanine\" is. There is a terrifying quality to the music that the entire album would be a perfect film score for a psychological thriller. The first two songs \"Angel\" and \"Risingon\" sounds like they would be perfect scores for my nightmares. I can never get tired of listening to \"Teardrop\" which features Elizabeth Fraser on vocals. The production is neither too slick or too gritty. \"Mezzanine\" is one of the few albums I can actually call flawless. Every song is a Massive Attack classic.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"And here I go, showing my age.  I have loved this song since it first came out, but at the time, I was young enough, I didn't really understand what it was about.  Now, as a grown up who watched a loved one fight and loose a battle with drug addiction, I get it.  And for a pop song, this is actually pretty haunting in it's sound.  But that is appropriate, because that is exactly what addiction does...it haunts not only the person who is using, but everyone in their lives.  And sometimes, like in the original video for this song, you end up with nothing but memories which will continue the haunting.  So many people think they're just signing on for a bit of fun, whether it's with street or prescription substances, and end up signing their lives away.  It's been 15 years this week since my brother passed away.  And it's a week that always haunts me, as does this song.  But I still love this song, even now that I am very painfully aware of what it means, it holds up very well to the passage of time, and not everything does.","classification":5,"fold":8}

I still remember sitting at the soda fountain and drinking an old fashioned coke while I checked out the back cover. This was Jon's first solo album after leaving Yes the year before. In fact, several of the songs were written as possible Yes songs. I actually think that the majority of the album is actually quite strong although some of my Yes friends at the time didn't seem to care too much for it.

She expanded her 2010 album Teenage Dream which sold very well, and added some songs that really cheapened the drive of the album. Wide Awake is honestly one of the songs, and honestly the song is not really exciting or driven. I was not very impressed with the song. It was not as appealing as her earlier songs showed to everyone like California Gurls did.

One has the brains the other is the muscle, this is another hit from the later 80's. This is the remastered hit, so it is a lot clearer and it sounds like the song came out yesterday.

{"text":"The first new studio album in five years from Grammy Award-winning Texas guitar hero Eric Johnson has finally arrived, and it's quite the trip - and well worth the wait. Like his other CDs a mix of instrumentals and vocal songs mostly penned by him and showcasing his unique virtuosity on the electric guitar, Up Close includes some of the best work that Johnson has ever written and recorded.\n\nThe album is dripping with crackling guitars. If a guitar died and went to heaven, this is what heaven would sound like. Johnson is on fire, effortlessly weaving incredible, sparkling solos in and out of both the instrumental and vocal tracks. The vocal songs range from energetic blues and rock numbers to gorgeous, heartfelt ballads. Inspired like never before, Johnson plays and sings with a fervor not present in his previous work. Perhaps Johnson is like a fine vintage wine, improving with age.\n\nI was first introduced to the music of Johnson 20 years ago by an employee at a local cable television station I was interning at during my senior year of high school. That was the year Johnson, then 36 years old, released his breakthrough second album, Ah Via Musicom, which achieved the distinction of having three instrumental songs reach the American Top Ten.\n\nAs accomplished and groundbreaking as Ah Via Musicom and its edgier and sonically more expansive 1996 follow-up, Venus Isle, are, Johnson has really poured his living, breathing essence into Up Close. The result is the best guitar-based album of the last several years, and one of the best guitar-based and general music albums of all time.\n\nWith Up Close, Johnson is at the top of his game as a guitarist, composer, and singer. He has created a masterwork of soulful jazz\/pop\/rock fusion that exudes passion, especially through his trademark virtuosic guitar sound. Even with guest vocals by Malford Milligan, Steve Miller, and Johnny Lang, and guitar performances by Jimmie Vaughan, Steve Hennig, and Sonny Landreth, the album is clearly all Eric Johnson up close front and center.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"It has been quite awhile since we have heard anything new from Alicia Keys. Musically, the past several years have not seen her at her best musically with her last album Girl On Fire. While it did have a few good songs like New Day, and her solo title track, which she did a version with Nicki Minaj, but Nicki just made the song go down into flames. Now, Alicia has had a lot of personal joy, being a mother, and focusing with charity work for From Tha Ground Up, which she co-founded a few years earlier. But now that Alicia is attempting to return back to the music industry. Her latest single In Common, reminds me so much of the chance that Sting took to make a hypnotic rhythmic song with Desert Rose in 1999, and it became his biggest-selling solo single in years. Here, the song has a driven, hypnotic and spiritual rhythm that is showing Alicia is taking a step forward musically and spiritually well. How come she has had so many great works of art, where as the joke divas Rihanna, Beyonce' and Ariana Grande have really wasted their voices, and made songs that display to the heart and soul that they absolutely have poor talent. This is a good song, and a nice treat for die hard Alicia Keys fans, and a good download for new Alicia Keys fans alike.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":8}
{"text":"There is no doubt about why I named Rihanna the most Overexposed artist of 2008. she has had so many single and videos that have felt like they've been flimsy and lacking a lot of heart. After the lackluster and less than meaningful Disturbia, is is hard to believe she would make a 9th single, yes that is right a 9th single from the album A Good Girl Gone Bad. Rehab, the latest single from that album, feels more like a waste of soul. While the video shows her trying to seduce Justin Timberlake, the song itself doesn't seem to deliver in tune with her voice. It just feels like it is another waste of pop trash. I'd rather recommend Beyonce's recent single If I Were A Boy as a MP3 download for your player over this song. Rihanna just needs to go away for awhile. Not only that, but if you're looking a real rehab song, choose Amy Winehouse's soul-driven Rehab instead.\n\nSong: F","classification":1,"fold":8}

Yes Jewel has gone pop, but her music still has substance. Many accuse her of selling out, but she hasn't, this style of music isn't what is all over the place right now. The first single \"Intution\" is a piece of pop heaven, that has proven to be a big hit for her, and people seem to enjoy her new style.

Sweat has put out several of albums and this one has to be in the bottom half of my favorite ones. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I like to hear the craftmanship of an artist. Sweat's new album did not open any new avenues for me. \"Test Drive\" was a real interesting single and for the most part JOE called the tone. I can't speak for everyone else, but for me the songs on the album didn't fit the  bill. I gave Sweat 3 stars only because of his tenured career. I just couldn't understand the reason why artist of the old school have to try and change. To me, it's like selling your soul.

{"text":"I can remember the first time I heard this song on the radio, and I thought what people around the world must have been thinking as well: \"This song is just what I needed.\"\n\nI'll get to the words of the song in a moment, but I have to say first that one thing that separates Marvin Sapp from so many in the industry is that he knows how to connect the listener with what he is singing and feeling. That is a true gift that not every one has, but it is something that makes the difference in whether people are able to \"get it\" when it comes to the message.\n\nAs for the words \"He saw the best in me when everyone else around could only see the worst in me\" is really a mouthful. How many of us have made mistakes in our lives, learned from them and tried to move forward, only to have others try to define you by those very mistakes. That is the difference in God and man. God is not worried about your past---if it truly is your past---all He is concerned with is the man\/woman you are today. That's all that matters to Him.\n\nMarvin Sapp articulates this in a way that you can't help but relate, and I believe that people will be inspired and encouraged by the message and the way its delivered.\n\nTruly one of those songs that will lift you up when you are feeling down, THE BEST IN ME reminds us of whose opinion really matters.","classification":5,"fold":8}

Apparently Tegan and Sara have been around since the 90's.  Didn't know that.  I'd heard OF them but I'd never really HEARD them.\n\nBut let's dispense with the usual summary\/description\/analysis stuff and simply say a few words in favor of this record in the hope that you'll decide to hear it for yourself:\n\nI was working on another review of a more serious sounding and self-important indie rock release, and although the record was pretty good, I was having trouble focusing.  I decided to take a break and try Tegan and Sara's new dancey pop record HEARTTHROB instead.  Bingo.  Suddenly listening to music was fun again and I didn't have to work so hard to like what I was hearing.  If some albums are like eating your vegetables and some albums are like eating your fruit, then I would say HEARTTHROB is a nice juicy peach.\n\nSincerely,\n\nConstant Listener","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Dierks Bentley is a man with a dilemna. He got where he is today by more or less fitting comfortably on your country music radio dial. He was never a pretty boy in tailored \"cowboy\" clothes but he was undeniably sing along catchy. Well, it seems he's been harboring a desire to stretch out a bit and make an old timey, honest to goodness, country bluegrass album. What's a habitual top forty resident to do? You want a comparison to this album? Steve Earle's album \"The Mountain\" with the Del McCoury Band springs to mind. Maybe Ricky Skaggs back in the days when he was getting radio airplay and maintaining his country integrity. Well, Del never really got along with Steve because of his prickly attitude and salty language but he and Ronnie show \"Up On The Ridge\" to lend Dierks a hand and it's a match made in heaven. Del even contributes a killer vocal on \"Pride In The Name Of Love\". Yes, that \"Pride In The Name Of Love\". Trust me, it makes a great bluegrass tune. Whenever the McCourys aren't burning up the strings, there are stellar turns by Nickel Creek alumnus Chris Thile and The Punch Brothers, Tim O'Brien, Bryan Sutton, Allison Krauss, Sam Bush and Vince Gill. Oh wait, there's more. The reigning king and queen of outlaw country, Jamey Johnson and Miranda Lambert, accompany Dierks on \"Bad Angel\". Heck, Dierks may have used them as examples when he convinced Capitol Nashville that a real country album might actually get played on the radio. I'm not done yet. The greatest living songwriter of our time, Kris Kristofferson joins Dierks for a rendition of his very own \"Bottle To The Bottom\". The impressive things about this album is that Dierks is not overshadowed by his all star lineup. He co-wrote five of the songs and all the stellar hired help only serve to accentuate a whole bunch of positives that make up Dierks Bentley.

{"text":"This is a two CD live album with a whopping 30 tracks that cover all facets of Taylor's career up to the early 90's.  Backed by a 9 piece band the album really showcases the versatility that a Taylor live show encompasses.  When one thinks of James Taylor it is usually the single guy with an acoustic guitar that you think of, but live Taylor really puts on an energetic show with a wide variety of music.  Taylor has always had an element of soul to some of his stuff, and with the backup band and especially backup singers this album injects a significant amount of soul influence into the several tracks.  All the big hits are here along with some of Taylor's better album cuts.  For me one of the highlights is the inclusion of the song \"Milworker\" which was written for a musical and not on any official Taylor album.  The song is one of the best he has ever written and for anyone who has ever worked in a factory environment pretty much nails what day to day life is like.  I don't have any of Taylor's studio albums so for me this collection is a great overview of the many facets of Taylor's output.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Last year, Nine Inch Nails bounced back from the artistic decay that was \"With Teeth\" with \"Year Zero\", a record that I believe to be Nine Inch Nails' artistic high point, a dense but never fractured album that featured some of his highest production and some of his sharpest songwritting.\nNow, only a year later, Nine Inch Nails and their leader Trent Reznor, who for all intents and purposes is Nine Inch Nails, have returned with the nearly two hour \"Ghosts I-IV\", a set of atmospheric instrumentals.\nNow, if you would have told me even two years ago that the words \"prolific\" and \"Trent Reznor\" would ever, EVER be mentioned in the same sentence I would have laughed at you. But apparently after getting sober and getting the awfulness of \"With Teeth\" out of his system the man is just that. A total of thirty six tracks, \"Ghosts\" is as sprawling in ambition as \"The Fragile\", even without the accompaniment of vocals.\nIn fact, this new, quicker working version of Trent Reznor works much better for the music than the one who would spend a good half a decade pain stakingly going over every note. Like \"Year Zero\" last year, there is an immediacy to \"Ghosts\" that previous NIN records lacked. Though the record is dense and layered, it is never overblown with needless tinkering and a million small little pops and bells and whistles that can be found on earlier NIN products.\nIt's also nice to see Reznor in a true collaborative spirit, as \"Ghosts\" is co-written by Atticus Ross and Alessandro Cortino, NIN's current keyboard player. The difference in perspective helps give this record a feel different of any previous Nails album.\nAnd let's all be honest with each other: the weakest point to any Nine Inch Nails record has always been the lyrical skills of Reznor. Usually clumsy, occasionally inane, Reznor lets the music do the talking for him this time, which is a nice plus.\nSo why only three stars for this record? Well, because at times \"Ghosts\" feels like a collection of ideas rather than songs. Though there is nothing awful on this record, there is also very little that is extraordinary, and it is too long for it's own good. The mood swings of the record are all complimented well, but too many song build and build and build and just stop, rather than fully taking off and entering someplace different and more interesting.\nIn fact, the best place to listen to \"Ghosts\" is probably in your car, late at night, driving home, where it can sink into your head but you're never really paying close attention to it.\nBut \"Ghosts\" is worth the purchase for sure. It's price, and the quality of good, if rarely great, music, and the fact that after almost twenty years Trent Reznor actually sounds like he's enjoying the process of making music.\nHopefully this is a series that he will continue to work on for many years to come.","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"Jennifer Kate Hudson astounded the world with her outstanding performance alongside the likes of Beyonce' and Eddie Murphy in the movie adaption of the Broadway classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Dreamgirls\/dp\/B000O1799U\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dreamgirls<\/a>. This was a demanding role,especially from a relative newcomer. And Hudson not only made an enormous impression vocally in the film,but pulled off her role from an acting perspective so convincingly that she is one of the few personalities of that era who almost upstaged Beyonce',even though it was by no means intentional. It was clear that Hudson was going to have a major impact as a recording artist. The soul\/R&B world she was entering into was filled with negligible vocal talents backed up by fair to middling music,to be kind. Especially when it came to female performers. They often were more in the position of being recording super models,more concerned with fashion and makeup than musical talent. So hooking up with Clive Davis at Arista,Hudson basically came at the music world from the opposite end of the spectrum.\n\n  \"Spotlight\" begins the album with one of it's very best numbers,a vibrant late 70's\/early 80's post disco dance\/funk number that introduces Hudson's booming soul belt of a voice with a melodically strong number very much worthy of the vocalists abilities. The slower material such as \"If This Isn't Love\",\"Giving Myself\",\"You Pulled Me Through\",\"Invisible\" and the dynamic \"Can't Stop The Rain\" get the full on Aretha treatment where her vocal relationship with the music and melody is so close knit it seems a sure fire chance she wrote the songs herself. For a track featuring a cliched guest rapper the beat boxing and harmonically rich \"Pocketbook\",with Ludacris not only has a spicy sense of humor about it but is extremely funky musically and his rap goes well with the song. Cannot say the same for \"What's Wrong (Go Away) with T-Pain,which is too defined by it's cliches of autotune and too much attention focused on the guest where..well one might feel they want to take the song title literally.\n\n  Hudson brings out the heavy southern soul flavor on both \"I'm His Only Woman\",a sassy two timer anthem with her and Fantasia as \"the two lovers\" and \"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\". Musically and vocally,this challenging gospel style soul number is the highlight of the entire album with Hudson and the band bursting out of the music with so much emotional expression that Hudson seems like she will hold her final note in the song for an eternity. The closer is the more obvious gospel of \"Jesus Promised Me A Home Over There\",done more subtly. In the end,this is not a perfect album. But few of the best debuts are. It often isn't fair to the rest of an artists career if it is. But the majority of the album is extremely strong,and musically varied just to the right point where a vocalist of Hudson's caliber is able to discover what levels of soul and grooves she's best at dealing with. In the end,I'm convinced that with the release of this debut that she made those decisions very quickly and ably.","classification":4,"fold":8}
{"text":"Polished mosaic. A poignant description of Tantric's latest creation. Woven with layers of intricate melodies and huge, bold, rich harmonies. So crisp you could take a bite like a green apple and taste the burst of flavor! Honestly I was surprised. I was expecting something with a harder edge. This album cuts its own slice of American Pie. There are tracks with messages of social consciousness and responsibility without the element of  \"Feel Guilty bad human\" looming overhead. This troupe of musicians reminds me that there are, yes- artists who insist on putting forth their best effort. You can tell. So, what tracks stand out? Relentless is beautiful and has a very erotic rhythm to it. It's a Taqsim kind of thing. Winslow likes Change. Their rendition of Chains is indeed a compliment to Fleetwood Mac. Finesse! Chasing After- Wow, this song is like a fresh shot of double espresso. If this doesn't wake you up and get the blood going, see your doctor.

{"text":"There seems to be some criticism for the  \"The Crusade\", yet I see it as a breakthrough for Trivium. Thrash Metal just a memory when it comes to newer bands that come out on the scene, (unless it bands from the heyday of the period that are still releasing Thrash album such as the likes of Exodus, Overkill, and Anthrax) but Trivum has brought back the element of Thrash in their music. Does it sound like Metallica, well, not really. There is a similar style of vocals to Hetfield, but when it comes to the actual music, and not the vocal, its a strong mix of Thrash and Progressive Metal, straight out of the 1980's. Its not as \"Speed Driven\" as Metallica's \"Kill Em All,\" or \"Ride the Lighting\" and is a bit more complex on strong stuture, such as Iron Maiden and Dream Theater. Actually, if you want to make a comparsion to vocals, I believe that it is close to Chuck Billy from Testament. Whatever you want to compare it to, it is a really strong effort from this young band. I was not impressed with the first two albums, as Vocalist Matthew was using a high pitched scream, then mixing it in with some singing. I wasn't impressed with the vocal then, since it didn't seem to fit with the music, and it was like the vocal was over-powering the musicans. If you don't have a clue in what I am talking about, think Linkin Park, with the high pitched throat, then going into singing. On \"The Crusade\", Matt diches that style and it really seems to flow. I am so impressed with the album, that enjoyed every song. Maybe not the most intelligent lyric, but that doesnt take away from the strong musicanship on this album. So many complaints on how it sounds to much like Metallica or 80's Thrash, but doing something different from the rest of the Metal Masses is good. I mean, how many damn Metal bands are coming out and all sound the same. They all breed themselves after Korn, Limp Biskit, Slipknot, and Disturbed. Its about time that we get a band that decides to shake it up a bit, and go back to the great days of Thrash and Progressive Metal. This is a great effort, and its so impressive from a bunch of guys that aren't even old enough to get a beer yet. This is great. ENJOY","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I admit it. I'm a sucker for the violin. Like many people, I love a good violin concerto perhaps more than most kinds of orchestral works. Maybe that's part of the reason I believe this may well be the best \"99 most whatever\" set so far.\n\nAnd it is even better that it is possible to get this set for free. Amazon MP3 published a link to a three-dollar promotional code on its Facebook page November 22, which renders this set free at the \"Daily Deal\" price on November 24, 2010, with some change to spare.\n\nThe 99 tracks here really consist of 38 works, which include practically all the major standard repertory concertos -- the Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky, Brahms, Sibelius, the first Bruch, and the first two Paganini concertos. The Beethoven \"Spring\" Sonata is also a popular \"greatest hit\" from classical music.\n\nThere are also a number of other great full-length works. On the modern side, there is the second Prokofiev concerto. The melancholy Elgar sonata is a great addition, and Ravel's \"Tzigane\" played by Igor Oistrakh is a real treat. I am also glad to get a nice version of Saint-Saens \"Introduction and Rondo Capriccio\" into my collection through this set.\n\nThe baroque and classical periods, which produced beautiful violin music but often lack the virtuoso fireworks of modern standard repertory violin concertos, are also featured heavily. The highlight here is probably the old warhorse, Vivaldi's Four Seasons, which X5 has trotted out in at least excerpted form in most of these \"99\" collections -- but here at least in a satisfying new version (for buyers in the series) featuring Yehudi Menuhin. Other Vivaldi works include \"L'Estro Harmonico\" and \"Il Ritiro\".\n\nBach is well represented with the Concerto for Two Violins (again featuring Yehudi Menuhin), Violin Concertos 1 and 2, Sonata No. 1 and Partita No. 5. The latter solo violin works might be my least favorite in the set -- the playing by Conrad von der Goltz is good, but the pieces were recorded in a high-echo, reverb-heavy room which created a sound not quite to my taste. Yours may be different.\n\nThere are four Mozart violin concertos (nos. 1, 3, 4 and 5), plus the Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola and a few other short works and excerpts.\n\nThis set is based on a marketing tactic that must have been developed by an evil genius. In 14 of the longer works on offer, X5 has sold individual movements from the same performances in previous \"99\" sets -- but it is now adding the \"missing\" pieces to give the buyer the entire work. This is an ingenious way to sell things twice. However, at this price, I can accept it. Many of the short, single-movement works are also repeats from other sets in the series, such as the Meditation from Thais, the Beethoven Romances, or Arvo Part's \"Spiegel im Spiegel\".\n\nIn some cases, full concertos are repeated from other \"99\" sets in the same performance -- for example, the Mendelssohn concerto or \"Il Ritiro\" from the Vivaldi set are straight repeats. However, in the case of Brahms and Tchaikovsky, the \"99\" sets focused on those composers had different full-length performances of the concertos.\n\nIn my view, this collection is still well worth the price despite some repetition -- especially at the negligible Daily Deal price. The first movement of the Beethoven concerto alone -- featuring Christian Tetzlaff and the SWR Orchestra -- is probably worth it (the 2nd and 3rd movements were in the Beethoven set). Tetzlaff plays amazingly, and uses the Beethoven\/Schneiderhan cadenzas, which are relatively seldom heard. Great stuff. The wonderfully melancholy Elgar sonata and even some of the Mozart and Bach concertos fill in some holes in my collection, and it's nice to have them here.\n\nThe performances range from good to great. As we expect with these sets, the names often aren't the most famous, but the musicianship and recording quality are very good.\n\nThis is a mammoth set, coming in at 12 hours and 35 minutes, with a total download size of 1.19 GB. As with all these collections, birates are variable. Sound is good, with average bitrates ranging from 210 to 247 kbps.\n\nCannot be recommended too highly for people who are newish to classical music, and I think even people with serious collections should pick this one up. It's a solid set of valid musical interpretations -- five stars all around.\n\nUPDATE: Some people are asking for a composer breakdown, so by popular demand, here is a full album listing that includes track number, composer, title, violinist, and comments about repetition from previous sets:\n\n1-12. Vivaldi, The Four Seasons -- Yehudi Menuhin, violin. \"The Four Seasons\" shows up on just about every X5 set in some form, and a complete version was included in Vivaldi set.

{"text":"With apologies to Bernie Taupin. This is a great sad song from one of the most popular, most underrated bands of the '70's. Definitely not Classic Rock, but soft-rock as it was called at the time. This song is left off of many compilations. (This was recommended by Google Music Manager an app built into the Android operating system for phone and tablets. I'm sure they intended that I buy it from Google Play. But if you set things up right you can buy your mp3s and CDs from Amazon, getting Auto-Rip and free Amazon Cloud storage! Amazon's Music Manager will download your songs into your iTunes Library and then you can use Google Desktop Music Manager software (for Windows or Apple OSX) to upload your songs to Google's Music Manger cloud storage. If you're really ambitious you can even burn your mp3s to CD. Start at Amazon and you can move your music to almost any platform!)","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"This is a fantastic album, and my favorite Rick Springfield effort so far. His music is so vibrant and full of energy that you just want to get up and move!\n\nFittingly, the subjects in, \"Songs for the End of the World,\" are often dark.  But his music never drags you down, and is never dismal.  Springfield is a man with a sense of humor, and it shows.  Look at his marketing campaign for this album for example, the album's title, and that smirk on his face on the cover picture.)\n\nSo, what do I mean by dark subjects?  Check out the titles of these songs, \"Our Ship's Sinking,\" \"I Hate Myself,\"  \"Depravity,\" and \"Love Screws Me Up.\"  And then there are the lyrics, which include \"Heal my broken soul...,\" (\"My Last Heartbeat\"); \"I go to sleep at night on a bed of nails...,\" (\"Love Is Never a One-Way Street\"); and \"Somewhere between pain and fear you got me on my feet\" (\"I Found You\").  And then there's the humor (?) of, \"A Sign of Life,\" directed at aliens and asking them to come to Earth and help us out.\n\nI've been a fan of Rick Springfield's since the release of \"Jessie's Girl\" back in the early 1980's. (He won a Grammy back in the day.)  It has always been apparent that Springfield pours a great deal of energy and emotion into his songs, and that he is capable of reaching deep down inside of himself to turn very dark subject matter into some seriously rocking, spectacular music. That's quite a feat, when you think about it.\n\nRock on, Rick!","classification":5,"fold":8}

And this song is surprising. If you have never heard it before, you might want to give it a try. But, some will not like it, while others will love it. It's a hit or miss song.\n\nBut if you love this song, or you hate this song, give The Kook's cover of the song a try. They give it a very interesting, and unique acoustic take to the song. And, the added British vocals give the song another level of charm.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"After staging arguably the biggest musical comeback this side of Tina Turner with her dance-driven project BELIEVE, Cher's back three years on to offer up more of the same with LIVING PROOF.Utitlizing many of the same producers, she attempts to build on the momentum experienced with the previous set, and the end result is an overall more consistent album.  Granted, there's nothing here that matches the instant pleasure of 'Believe' or 'All or Nothing', but there's also nothing here that matches the abundance of filler found on BELIEVE either. Lyrically, the tracks follow similarly in the vein of her eighties' corporate-rock albums than her more recent output. The set's first international single, 'The Music's No Good Without You',seems an odd choice, if only because it isn't one of the albums more ingratiating tunes.  Far better is 'Alive Again', as well as 'A Different Kind Of Love Song' and 'Real Love'. Also interesting is 'You Take It All', an electronica-driven track that sounds like Cher trying to channel Olive or Dido.  Among the very few missteps are the sole ballad 'Rain Rain', which is just plain dull, as well as a pedestrian remake of 'When The Money's Gone'. The only other minor quibble is the use of the dreaded vocoder on nearly all the tracks--it sounded cool the first thousand times we heard 'Believe', but has since been rendered just another tired, over-utilitzed gimmick--her voice is better than ever, and the heavy reliance on vocal effects just detracts from the album's overall impact after several listens. Though it doesn't match her underrated nineties opus IT'S A MAN'S WORLD as her best, it is a superior album to BELIEVE and reinforces the notion that Cher sounds best when she supresses the rock chick and unleashes her inner dance diva.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"The first thing you notice on this CD is how happy John Fogerty sounds. Well, he should, these are all the songs he loves- he says if he had to get up and sing in a bar, these are the songs he would choose.  The history of the Blue Ridge Rangers has been told many times-when it was time to hang up the Cleerance Clearwater tunes, he took some time off, but then recorded again. Not knowing how to sing without a group he named his group the Blue Ridge Rangers. However, he made up all the members and played every instrument.  That was years ago, and when he resurrected the group, he got some real good time players. This CD is the best, you are so gonna like it!\n\nThese tunes of Fogerty's are some of the ones I love. The biggest and best surprise to me is Ricky Nelson's old 'Garden Party'-I have loved that song forever and John F says he can relate to it- he and Ricky were very smart men. Fogerty chose Don Henley to help him with this one- play it over and over. 'Never Ending Song Of Love' an old timer incarnate! 'Back Home Again' didn't we all love John Denver at one time?  Ray Price, 'I'll Be There If Ever You Need Me'-ya gotta love it- what a tune.  'Change In The Weather' is an original of John Fogerty's. I know you're gonna be shocked by this one' Moody River' originally sung by Pat Boone- it is marvelous!!! 'Heaven's Just A Sin Away' by the Kendalls- whoopee! And, to top this marvelous CD off, Bruce Springsteen joins John Fogerty with the Everly Brothers 'When Will I Be Loved'- never, ever heard it any better, never eva!\n\nLA Times says \"By nearly any measure, Fogerty belongs on the A list of rock musicians who matter. As Credence's chief songwriter, lead singer and guitarist, he created a remarkably deep body of work in an astonishingly short period from the 1968 release of the band's debut album through the group's 1972 swan song.\" Couldn't have said it any better myself!\n\nThis is a mix of country, folk, rock n'roll and one of the best CDs I have heard in a long time.  Can't wait to tell my best friend, so we can listen to it together!\n\nHighly Recommended.  prisrob 09-08-09\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Long-Road-Home-The-Ultimate-John-Fogerty-Creedence-Collection\/dp\/B00004VWGN\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Long Road Home: The Ultimate John Fogerty\/Creedence Collection<\/a>\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Revival\/dp\/B000ULQVCK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Revival<\/a>\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Blue-Ridge-Rangers\/dp\/B000000XC0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Blue Ridge Rangers<\/a>","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"It is absolutely so sad that Beyonce' Knowles has taken a whole lot of chances by bringing yet another surprise record, and the lack of her voice has been nothing more short of a songstress whom has been more of a stunt, than just letting her voice speak for itself. It is sad, because she has not been making really good songs, but borrowing the same stunts and overexposure hat artists like Michael Jackson and the recently deceased Prince have had for years. But they have really had some excellent songs that have stood the test of time. Unfortunately, Beyonce has not been able to do that. When I first heard her song Formation a few months ago, I honestly would have to say that I really was dearly unimpressed with where her music was going. It fell flat like the soul passing on. I really found this song to be her worst dance anthem since Partition. She really put out all they hype for # Lemonade, for nothing but a sour lemon. This should go into the same place Rihanna's Work has been, tired and worn out.\n\nSong: D 1\/2-","classification":2,"fold":8}

{"text":"Loved the deftones since 1997 when I first heard the song bored on their first album adrenaline. They always change their sound and evolve with each album like a good solid band should. Gore is no exception. A little bit more on the mellow side than their last album. But there's plenty of headbangers to keep the metal head happy. Like acid hologram and doom user. But a lot of their songs on this album are moody and change from mellow to heavy which I like a lot. There's sort of a darker mood on this album like sort of a goth vibe I like too. Chino's vocals are better than ever. Do things I didn't think he could do or hitting notes I didn't think he could hit which is a nice surprise. Stephen is a great guitar player playing more of a atmosphere then showing up his shredder chops. Some of his guitar player surprised me a lot of this album too in a good way. Good solid album by the deftones. Sort of charting in a new territory for them but still sounds like the deftones.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that no true Mary J. Blige fan expected Blige to return with an album that was as classic as 2005's brilliant THE BREAKTHROUGH. Blige even commented that she wasn't concerned about outdoing the success of that milestone in her career. While the exceptional GROWING PAINS doesn't trump THE BREAKTHROUGH, it is another solid album in MJB's career.  With that said, Blige does experiment more on GROWING PAINS that she has on previous albums which gives all fans a taste of what the future may hold for Blige. It is a well balanced mixed of adult contemporary styled R&B, hip-hop, and urban contemporary music.\n\nThe album starts off on the right foot with \"Work That\", which is honestly the best of the two singles released from GROWING PAINS as of yet.  The production isn't far removed from NO MORE DRAMA's \"Family Affair\" and proves to be a welcome addition to Mary's collection.  \"Grown Woman\" is one of the big surprises of GROWING PAINS in which Blige channels her hip-hop soul roots for a banger that will surely crossover to R&B purists as well as hip-hop savvy listeners.  Ludacris's guest verse is sound here, but Mary J. Blige makes sure that all eyes are on her as she shed's through this albums \"Enough Cryin'\".  The difference? Harder drums and a more spunky vocal performance from MJB.\n\n\"Just Fine\" follows and keeps the momentum moving forward.  When I first heard this track, I was actually a bit disappointed.  It took time for it to grow on me and when it did, it was hott!!! Again, \"Work That\" is still the best.  \"Feel Like a Woman\", \"Stay Down\", and \"Hurt Now\"  are all strong.  \"Shakedown\" features Usher and while it isn't Usher's best collaboration (that would be \"Same Girl\"), it is enjoyable.  \"Til Morning\" is this albums \"Gonna Breakthrough\" or \"You Can't Hide From Luv\"  - it's nearly perfect.  \"Roses\" and \"Fade Away\" are solid, but not as exciting as the earlier tracks or the phenomenal \"What Love Is\", \"Work in Progress (Growing Pains)\", or neo-soul inflected \"Talk To Me\" with its six feel groove.  \"If You Love Me\", \"Smoke\", and \"Come To Me (Peace)\" are solid, though they aren't the best of the best of GROWING PAINS. Notably, \"Come To Me\" does features innovative production work combining the best of the adult-alternative pop with R&B\/Hip-hop synths.\n\nAll quibbles aside, GROWING PAINS is destined to be another critical and commercial hit for MJB.  It may not match THE BREAKTHROUGH, but who cares.  Mary has been representing since circa 1990 and each and every album has been incredibly consistent - she can sing her butt off! Even LOVE & LIFE, weaker than her other efforts, was a shining moment because MJB can make bad material sound better than what it is and that is a gift. 4 stars Mary - Keep working that!!!","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Even though I was a fan of \"Maybe I Deserve\", I have no problem admitting that I never paid attention to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Force-of-Nature\/dp\/B000059T5H\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Force of Nature<\/a>.  I would take the CD out to listen to \"Maybe I Deserve\" and eventually \"Slowly\" and the CD ended up collecting dust.  Even though I liked the track \"One Man\", I never purchased the CD and I still haven't heard it 'til this day.  When I heard \"Please Don't Go\", that was my turning point.  I bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sex-Love-Pain\/dp\/B000P6R822\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sex Love & Pain<\/a>&nbsp;and I played the CD from beginning to end for a minute.  Tracks like \"Coldest\", \"I Hate U\", \"Heartbreaker\", \"When\", etc. remained in heavy rotation for a minute.  I finally revisited \"Force Of Nature\" and I wondered why I had waited so long to hear the CD. It was pretty good.  Tank released&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Now-Or-Never\/dp\/B003XJDSZ4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Now Or Never<\/a>&nbsp;in 2010.  Tracks like \"Sex Music\", \"Celebration\" w\/Drake, \"I Can't Make You Love Me\", \"Can I\" & \"Scream\" were my favorites and while \"Now Or Never\" wasn't \"Sex, Love & Pain\", it was definitely a good CD.  Tank released \"This Is How I Feel\" in May of 2012.  It's clearly evident once the Intro comes on what the theme of this CD will be.  I didn't expect the explicit nature of some of the lyrics on here, but if you can get past that, you have a pretty good CD on your hands.  Chris Brown joins Tank on my favorite track \"Lonely\".  Tank explains a situation where he just had a relationship that ended and he is attempting to forget his ex by having nights out at the club, drinking alcohol and even getting into new situations with other women.  Despite his efforts, he still can't get his ex off of his mind and he still realizes that she is the one for him, regardless of the relationship being over.  On the 2nd verse I expect to hear Chris Brown singing a verse and instead he is able to rap a verse about how much he misses Rihanna.  Normally, this would be a turn off but his verse falls right in line with the message Tank is trying to get across.  \"Your One\" slows things down as Tank always knows how to make a sexual slow jam.  He puts in his application to a single woman and is telling her that he is the one that she needs. \"Don't Give Up\" has Tank telling his woman to keep up with him sexually.  Be warned, because he brags that they will both fall out when he is finished. \"Off Your Hands\" has Tank diggin' a woman that already has a man that isn't treating her right.  He has no problem stepping in and being the man that the one she has isn't being.  \"Compliments\" features Kris Stephens & TI, as Tank makes his woman feel like \"the most beautiful girl in the world\" as Tank knows how to pour the good thoughts on about his lady.  TI lends a nice assist as well to co-sign the point Tank has been making throughout the whole song.  \"Nowhere\" features Busta Rhymes as Tank is saying the way he puts things down and the way he treats his woman that she clearly isn't going anywhere.  The title track has Tank continuing with his \"Sex Music\" and what is the theme of the CD. \"Next Breath\", \"Better Than Me\", and \"Lost It All\" change things up a bit as Tank talks about something other than his favorite word.  \"Next Breath\" has Tank describing a situation where he can't see himself being with anyone else other than this particular woman.  As much as Tank talks about sex, he always has a few songs on each CD where he displays his songwriting talents and shows that he can make other types of songs as well.  \"Better Than Me\" has Tank expressing how he feels after his woman has moved on to a different situation based on the way he treated her in the relationship.  \"Lost It All\", because of the beat will immediately have you thinking Prince's \"Purple Rain\" and Trey Songz' \"Yo Side Of The Bed\".  If you can get past the similarities and listen to the lyrics, you will actually hear a pretty good song.  Depending on what version you have of \"This Is How I Feel\", you also get \"Crazy\" featuring Kevin McCall from Chris Brown's \"Deuces\" and \"Underrated\".  \"Underrated\" has Tank describing the fact that he feels under the radar, which is true outside of true r&b audiences.\n\nOn \"This Is How I Feel\" you won't hear too many things that you haven't already heard from Tank in the past.  However, if you liked \"Sex, Love & Pain\" and \"Now Or Never\", I am pretty sure that you will like this effort as well.  Just be forewarned that you will hear some explicit lyrics and you will hear a lot about Tank's favorite word.\n\nJames' Top 5\n\n1) Lonely w\/Chris Brown\n2) Compliments w\/Kris Stephens & TI\n3) This Is How I Feel\n4) Off Your Hands\n5) Next Breath\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\nNowhere w\/Busta Rhymes\nYour One\nUnderrated\nBetter Than Me","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"The Rolling Stones' fifth studio album of the 1970s (and sixth overall for their Rolling Stones Records label which was distributed by Atlantic Records) entitled Black and Blue was released in April of 1976.\nThis particular Rolling Stones album was the first studio album for the band since the abrupt departure of guitarist Mick Taylor who left after the It's Only Rock and Roll album's releaseand promo videos shot for the album. Some have called Black and Blue \"the guitar audition album\" because Wayne Perkins, Harvey Mandel (of Canned Heat) and Ron Wood (of Rod Stewart's Faces) all took turns auditioning for the guitarist spot abandoned by Taylor (and Wood would eventually acquire the spot as of 1975). Lead singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards wrote all but one track  (\"Cherry Oh Baby\") on this album and the album is a classic (as I found out when I grabbed the album for Christmas in 1989 on cassette when it was on Rolling Stones\/Columbia\/CBS Records).\nThe Black and Blue album was recorded between December of 1974 and December of 1975 in Germany at Musicland Studios and at Mountain Studios in Montreux with Mick and Keith producing and the late Keith Harwood recording and the legendary Glyn Johns mixing in February of 1976 at Atlantic Studios. Bass player Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts played well on this album as well.\nThe Black and Blue album opens with the funky opener \"Hot Stuff\" which featured lead guitarist Harvey Mandel which stiffed as a single. Next is the rocker \"Hand of Fate\" with Wayne Perkins doing some great fretwork. We follow with the reggae version of \"Cherry Oh Baby\" featuring Nicky Hopkins on organ. Side one closed with the superb ballad \"Memory Motel\" featuring Mick on piano as well as vocal with Keithalso singing the refrain at the end of the choruses.\nRon Wood's slide induced guitar kicks Side 2 off with the rocker \"Hey Negrita\". Next is the jazzy duet with Billy Preston called \"Melody\" which sounds like something from a jazz club complete with horn sections. Next is the hit ballad from the album entitled \"Fool to Cry\" featuring Jagger on vocals and Fender Rhodes piano and Nicky Hopkins on grand piano (the song was a Top 10 hit in the US). We close with the rocker \"Crazy Mama\" with a great guitar riff from Mick Jagger whom played rhythm guitars on the track and also sings like no tomorrow..\nThe Black and Blue album did very well hitting #1 making it the fifth Stones studio effort in a row to top Billboard and was the first Platinum album for the band. Some fans hate this album, but others like me, love it. The remaster has all of the original LP credits and artwork restored.\nThis album is highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I'd call this a Smooth Jazz album before a New Age one; some of the cuts even sound more like excerpts from movie soundtracks, but it has enough esoteric and ethnic instruments and elements to have it qualify it as such.  It may also have to do with the fact that the majority of the artists appearing on it are Asian- obviously as vehicle to showcase their talents.  Not that it's a bad album- it's great!- just mis-labeled, in my opinion.\n\nA few highlights from Disc 1:\nMoonday: playful and engaging live piece from Andreas Vollenweider.\n\nA Poet in the Afternoon: feels a lot like an extended tone poem, but very enjoyable.\n\nHeart: alto sax, strings and piano combine for a romantic interlude.\n\nSilver Spring Rain: mostly a piano\/cello combo until a melancholy yet effective female voice shows up.  Wonderful.\n\nWhite Fantasy: slow, piano only piece; you'll really enjoy Watanabe's tinkling on the ivories.\n\nWaterfall: another piano-oriented track accompanied by a few cameos of middle strings and some keyboards.\n\nDisc 2:\nKorea Idea: pan flute, xylophone, drums... very immersive!  It's like taking a slow boat down the Han River.\n\nMoon Healing: as sentimental and romantic a tune as you'll ever hear.  The tenor sax and strings were beautiful, simply beautiful.\n\nJapanese Roots: the intro definitely invokes imagery of a showdown between two bushido facing each other in a forest of bamboo- and gets drawn out too long- but it soon settles into its own groove.  Reminds me of the work of Noel Pointer and George Howard.\n\nWhether you're kicking back reading, exercising or just want a break from the world, this is a very relaxing, somber interlude that'll completely transport you to a quiet, soothing place.

{"text":"When it was first announced Daft Punk would be doing the score for \"Tron: Legacy,\" anyone who has ever held the original film on a pedestal among sci-fi movies was most likely overcome with joy.\n\nAfter all, Daft Punk's synthesized sound pulls a great deal from the early `80s when the original film was released. Even their helmeted costumes seem to resemble those worn in the computer world of \"Tron.\"\n\nHowever, what Daft Punk created was something much more serious than any of their studio albums. Like Christopher Nolan's new take on \"Batman,\" \"Tron: Legacy\" has been described as much darker than the original film and Daft Punk's score, released ten days before the film, follows suit.\n\nThe overture introduces Daft Punk's newest adventure with quite possibly the biggest departure from their original sound to be heard on the record.\n\nGentle horns gradually fill the air just as a full string section takes shape. By the end of \"Overture,\" timpani, cymbals, and a gong provide the ultimate climax, dramatically announcing Daft Punk's first full collaborative venture into cinema and the return of Tron simultaneously.\n\n\"The Grid\" is the only track with any words put to the music. With Jeff Bridges providing a voiceover for the first half of the track, the song acts as an introduction for anyone who may have missed the first film.\n\nAs \"The Grid\" fades out and \"The Son Of Flynn\" opens with an arpeggiated synthesizer, listeners get their first taste of Daft Punks blend between their own unique sound and classical music. Although the majority of the tracks on \"Tron: Legacy\" utilize an excellent balance between the two styles, some of the tracks sway one way or the other, drastically changing the mood of the piece.\n\nTracks like \"The Game Has Changed\" offer an almost exclusively classical instrumentation while transforming the percussion section into a series of powerful electronic hits, rattling the eardrums and taking focus off of the ominous strings hidden beneath.\n\nAlthough the London Philharmonic Orchestra provides all of the string arrangements, their true feature comes on \"Adagio for Tron.\" Sounding a bit like Hans Zimmer's \"Hummel Gets the Rockets\" from the soundtrack for \"The Rock,\" Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo of Daft Punk use this track as a means of showing off their prowess with orchestration, complete with a simple, yet beautiful cello solo.\n\nAs the mood darkens, the music dives deeper into the electronic realm while still maintaining at least some aspects of a symphonic orchestra. Tracks like \"End of Line\" pull entirely from the electronic realm except for a sustained string part which would typically get lost in a Daft Punk mix, but because of their extraordinary presence on the rest of the album, they remain surprisingly noticeable.\n\nEasily the song most reminiscent of Daft Punk's previous work is the club ready \"Derezzed.\" It's almost hard to believe this track falls on the same album as \"Adagio for Tron,\" but Daft Punk fans will make \"Derezzed\" the song from the movie to know. Although less than two minutes in length, \"Derezzed\" finds Daft Punk letting loose and presenting their trademark sound for the world to see on the big screen.\n\nWithout words to accompany the music, this album may not ring as positively for all Daft Punk fans, but it will easily add a great deal to the action captured on film. This may be Daft Punk's first venture into film soundtracks, but the duo's masterful work on \"Tron: Legacy\" makes it hard to believe it will be their last.\n\nSimilar Artists: Justice, Deadmau5\nTrack Suggestion: \"Adagio for Tron\"","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"In light of Lecrae's Billboard topping success, Grammy award recognition pale in comparison to the reward that comes from serving the Lord faithfully.  And he candidly crafts a song that questions whether or not he has the surefire approach to it all.  Is he scared of the acclaim, has he not been a forthcoming as a disciple of Christ?  Will he hear Jesus say to him \"Well done my good and faithful servant\"?  In the song \"Fear\" he carefully weighs those options, and the bass, keys, drums acoustic guitar to the multilingual translation of Psalm 23 are a introspective look at Lecrae's understanding.  And Natalie Lauren's beautiful voice offers encouraging advice to Lecrae's verses to be unafraid.  As people of God we know that the fear of men is a snare, But the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.  Great song, Lecrae!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Prime Cuts:  Today, When You Give Yourself Away, We Fly By Night\n\nWhen Allan sings, \"I'm not an easy man to understand,\" he's telling the truth.  Allan is a curly character:  beneath his aloof Californian surfer veneer is a vulnerable heart that pulsates with sensitivity.  And just like all his albums, Allan vacillates between these two character traits throughout these songs here again.  On some of the tracks he puts his foot to the pedal rocking like these is no tomorrow.  Yet, on the quieter moments he casts aside his machismo for some heart -to-heart confabulations.  Such an approach has continued to garner respect from Allan's male fans while adding much to flourish the romantic fantasies of his female aficionados.  As with his other records, Mark Wright is again at the knobs and he's to be thanked for such a quality record without an ounce of filler at all.  As far as the backings are concerned, this is your typical contemporary country record--slick and polished augmented by some occasional fiddling and steel guitar riffs.\n\nAllan seems to be at his best when he delves into his soul-searching moment.  Lead single \"Today\" sits comfortably with Gary-Allan's classics such as \"Watching Airplanes\" and \"Tough Little Boys.\" Performed with shovels of emotions, Allan sings of a man not giving up on his girl until the day of her wedding.  Except that she's marrying another man.  Prepare a box of Kleenex when Allan sings:  \"Today is the happiest day of her life\/I should be happy for her\/So tell me, why are these tears in my eyes?\"  Though nothing quite comes close to this Titanic of a ballad, \"When You Give Yourself Away\" comes close.  Few men are willing to admit the vulnerability of committing to a relationship, Allan tells it in such a moving way without sounding whimsical.  A soothing Keith Urban-like ballad with deft shades of 60s pop, \"We Fly By Night\" is a homily about not allowing the busy activities of life to rob the joys of our relationships.  \"She Gets Me,\" harkens back to country music way back in the 90s, where sensitive love ballads over a gorgeous melodies abound.\n\nAllan does let his swaggering side emerge with the album's title cut \"Get Off on the Pain.\"  It's a forgettable busy barnburner with screeching guitars turned up to the max.  Thank God producer Mark Wright had the sense to turn down the mix on the bluesy \"I Think I've Had Enough\" - a coming-of-age confession of a man seeing the futility of a rambling lifestyle.  Allan is one who doesn't just sing about songs plastered with rosy glee, \"Kiss Me When I'm Down\" is a realistic portrayal of a dysfunctional relationship.  A mid-tempo narrative \"Kiss Me When I'm Down\" that tells of the protagonist's obsession with his girl that he's even willing to be abused by her in order to keep her.  It's a realistic slice of life that makes the song so intriguing.\n\nAs it's the current trend now with most country records, it's often tail end with an inspirational tune.  At times such songs can be pretty obligatory but not with Allan.  The opening line of \"No Regrets\" is arresting enough for mandatory listening:  \"Scarecrows and devils are the only things out this late.\"  \"No Regrets\" is tell-it-all confession of a life well-spent despite its detours that is so perfect for Allan's rugged delivery.  In short,\"Get Off on the Pain\" scores again with spades of heart tugging moments, honest confessions, and some rowdy party kickers too.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"It's amazing what a few Grammy nominations can do.  India. Arie's debut album of folk-laced soul didn't break any new ground, but it was an overall appealing mix of catchy tunes and positive messages that were a welcome alternative to the talk-show\/men-bashing lyrics of her ghettoized peers.  And even though she walked home empty-handed on Grammy night, her debut album, \"Acoustic Soul,\" enjoyed robust multiplatinum sales.  Expectations are naturally high, and I hoped that her followup \"Voyage to India,\" would be a musical and lyrical step forward from her debut.  While the album is thoroughly listenable from start to finish, \"Voyage to India\" just doesn't serve a platter filling enough to stick to your ribs.  Arie has her heart in the right place, and her intentions are noble, but the truth remains that she's a passable lyricist, often resorting to \"love yourself\" cliches that become one-dimensional.  And while the music is pleasing, the folkish, acoustic-based melodies and choruses seem a bit predictable.  However, I really dug \"Little Things,\" the sincerity of the love song \"Beautiful Surprise,\" and \"Get it Together.\"  While \"Voyage to India\" is an okay album, it pales in comparison to better, superior albums we've heard in the last year from \"Cookie\" by MeShell Ndegeocello, the flawed yet fascinating \"Unplugged\" set from Lauryn Hill, and \"How Do I\" from Res.  Ultimately, it's a \"Voyage\" that takes off promisingly without ever reaching its final destination.","classification":3,"fold":8}

In fact, it is my favorite off this album.  The vocals, the lyrics, the synth...it captured me from the first time i listened to it.  Granted that was 15 years ago, but I still love it.  The band remixed just about every other song they ever made, why they passed this one by is a mystery to me.  I'd be curious to see if other DM fans feel the same way.  I have all their albums and 99% of everything else, including their 3 boxed sets of singles so i think I know what I'm talking about.\nIf you are new to Depeche Mode, start of with the single collections or greatest hits CD.

{"text":"Jennifer Hudson's cd is finally here and of course the question is was it worth the wait and hype? I can say yes for the most part. 'Jennifer Hudson' offers songs that fit this woman's voice - there are no odd selections that will leave you scratching your head or have her reaching far out of her genre. Most of the songs showcase her vocal range with her hitting notes and doing runs that will have you on your feet and applauding in the privacy of your home or car. Is it perfect? Of course not, there are a few things that make it a bit drab and predictable but the good points outweigh the weaknesses and flaws.\n\n The Good: The variety of the songs is the strength of the album. There's variety BUT her voice is never 'off' or subdued. In each song or within each style, the producers and the artist both find ways to keep things interesting and fresh. Unlike many artists, you can tell Hudson actually connected with the music and lyrics, which results in some really moving songs and fun moments. Stand-out tracks for me is the Beyonc&eacute;-esque 'If This Isn't Love' which is Hudson at her best in this pop ballad. 'Pocketbook' is also a winner with Hudson bringing out her sassy-edge that makes her endearing. Other tracks that left an impression were 'We Gon' Fight,' and 'Invisible' which contain lyrics many can relate to on some level.\n\n The Bad: A lot of the mid-tempo or slower songs simply blend into one another. While her voice is always on spot, these songs just seem a bit boring because they sound similar. I would have liked to have heard her experiment and take a few more chances as she does on the song 'Pocketbook' but still, these seem a bit too safe and expected or predictable. While I can understand the inclusion of her song 'All Dressed In Love' from Sex and the City: The Movie, I feel like everyone in the world has heard the Dreamgirls track 'And I'm Telling You' and would have rather seen a new track entirely or a remix of the song.\n\n A little dull and unbalanced in parts but in all, it's a good debut album that doesn't seem to be getting the 'spotlight' attention I think it should be. Check it out, you probably won't be let down.","classification":4,"fold":8}

I don't listen to newer artists a lot , but I really dig Wiz Khalifa style and Pittburgh swagger. \"We dem Boyz\" is a undeniable club banger, and the remix with rap god Nas and School boy Q is just simply head nod music at its best. \"Hope\" reminds me of Wiz's classic mixtape \"Cabin Fever\" and the overall feel of this album blends together seamlessly. I always admired Wiz Khalifa's strong song writing ability and he sings catchy hooks that connects with his growing fan base instantely. Deep lyrics about topics and stories that only the taylor gang boss can wax poetic about sonically. This is already a number one hit album according to the billboard 200 charts . Men lie, women lie, but numbers don't lie. Millions of dedicated and loyal fans (myself included) has been rewarded time and time again with dope music by Wiz Khalifa- a true artist that keeps integrity in his music with every release.

{"text":"I heard from a few people that Brian McKnight's latest album Gemini is his best album in a while, so I checked it out and now I'm wondering why I was misled. Brian was doing fine with his first two albums (his self-titled album and I Remember You), but then came Anytime, which, despite its success, was one of those albums that made you say, \"Well, at least he's releasing the right songs.\" While he did get his groove back and then some with Back At One, his following two albums (Superhero and U-Turn) were weak. And this album isn't much different.\n\nIt's not that Brian can't sing any more; it's just that there are too many missteps that can't be ignored. Things do start off with a bang, though, with \"What We Do Here\" and \"Everytime You Go Away\". But then comes the embarrassing \"Grown Man Business\", which makes it obvious that Brian still hasn't learned that trying to cater to the young crowd has never worked for him (ever hear the original version of \"Hold Me\" off Anytime?).\n\nThings also fail when guest rappers come aboard. I have no idea what Talib Kweli is doing on this album, but he kicks a lame verse on an already corny \"She\". But even worse than that is when Akon, Juvenile, Skip and some unknown femcee help Brian deliver the 106 & Park-ready \"Whatcha Gonna Do\". Brian still struggles by himself, though, especially with lyrics like \"I reach around and grab a little booty\/And it feels so good\" (from \"Here With You\"). \"All Over Now\" is another young crowd pleaser gone wrong.\n\nWhile the album comes to a remarkable close with \"Your Song\" and \"Me & You\", this album really show's Brian's vocal skills and not much else. At this point, I'd only suggest you buy Gemini to complete your Brian McKnight collection.\n\nAnthony Rupert","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"I am a huge fan of Corinne Bailey Rae. From my point of view Corinne and Norah Jones are the two best female vocalists of this current millennium.\n\nI first discovered Corinne back in 2006 while working out at the gym. The song \"Put Your Records On\" was played and I thought, who is this. I really like this song. When I got home I googled the lyrics and discovered Miss Corinne Bailey Rae and have been a fan ever since. She has a wonderfully unique voice.\n\nIt has been six years since Corinne released a new album. I have waited and waited for this. Her new album \"The Heart Speaks In Whispers\" was well worth the wait. This may end up being the \"must have\" album of the year.\n\nThe album poignantly opens with Corinne delicately singing the line, \"the heart speaks in whispers\" and continues beautifully with subtle emotion and soulful infusion. The album is filled with creative use of instrumental effects and really brings Corinne into a new age of sound and style. \"The Skies Will Break\" is a wonderfully textured song with various movements in sound and rhythmics tempos going from ballad to dance beat and back to ballad and finally ending with a Prince like vocal frenzy.\n\nThis album is full of remarkable surprises and beautiful emotional journeys. Her last album \"The Sea\" was a fantastic voyage of dark themed lyrics and personal pain and grief. \"The Heart Speaks In Whispers\" comes full circle back into amore optimistic nature yet still keeping an eye on that pain and grief Corinne experienced in 2008 when her husband died.\n\n\"Been To The Moon\" brings a bit of Prince influenced funk into the picture. It's part Prince, part Chaka Khan and wholly Corinne Bailey Rae. Toward the end of the song comes in a great horn interlude that is very reminiscent of a late 60's cool jazz timbre that adds an unexpected twist and texture to the song.\n\nI really love all the electronic hand clapping and finger snapping in the album's most mystique filled song \"Tell Me,\" Corinne sings this with a venture of mystery and soul. It's far way but right in your lap. As with most of the album this song contains high levels of sophisticated funk sounds and some excellent vocal effects.\n\nThis album is classy, cultured, funk-filled and soulful.\n\nFrom the musicianship to the colorful lyrics and right down to Corinne's vocal phrasing, \"Horse Print Dress\" has Prince written all over it.\n\nCorinne has evolved tremendously as a vocalist and a musical visionary. She has written or co-written every song on this album as well as one of the album's co-producers. Her music shows a great amount of depth and detail in every aspect of the development of each song, instruments, lyric and vocal.\n\n\"Ice Cream Colours\" is probably my favorite song from the album - so far. I love the fun sort of sound of this one - there's more of that great hand clapping effect that I really like. I'm a pushover for great percussion and this song is full of some outstanding drum work.\n\nI purchased the autographed deluxe edition of the album from amazon. com which also includes the auto-rip. I've listened to the downloaded auto-rip I received three times and today I will pickup my copy of the disc. I can hardly wait to see it. I'll do a second post on the album to share photos of the artwork. I'm sure it will be great.\n\nCorinne will move on to be remembered as one of this world's great song stylists. In my mind she's already there.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Aftermath Of The Lowdown is the highly anticipated third solo album from Richie Sambora and overall it is a strong collection of songs that shows off his beautiful vocal style and his ability to deliver a song with passion. The album was produced by Richie along with Luke Ebbin who made Bon Jovi explode with \"It's My Life\" a decade ago. The band consists of session players including Rusty Anderson on guitar who played with Paul McCartney's band and Matt Rollings on keys who played with Lyle Lovett. The song styles are a mixture of hard rockers, radio friendly modern rock, and those passionate ballads that have become Richie's trademark. Highlights include the emotional ballad \"Weathering The Storm\" written with legend Bernie Taupin, the amazing chorus vocals of \"I'll Always Walk Beside You\", the best song on the album \"Seven Years Gone\" which has a mind blowing chorus and also builds into an epic bridge section, the quality hard rocker \"Learning To Fly With A Broken Wing\", and the powerful emotional hit of \"Every Road Leads To You\". While it doesn't feel quite as unique and intense as Richie Sambora's previous two masterpiece solo albums, Aftermath Of The Lowdown is certainly a quality addition to an amazing body of work that delivers on the promise of emotional vocals that we have come to expect from the bluesman - 4.5 stars.","classification":4,"fold":8}

Gotta love this song.\n\nTRAPPED UNDER ICE\n\nIncredible.\n\nESCAPE\n\nA great song with great lyrics and a rockin' sound.\n\nCREEPING DEATH\n\nAs much as I love hearing this one, it creeps me out because of the title. But I can't help it when I just sing along with James on this one.\n\nTHE CALL OF KTULU\n\nInstrumental song.\n\nWhat an album! These guys know what fans want in a Heavy Metal album. This band is definitely going to be here for a long a** time. So get up off your a** and buy this album if you don't have it already.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Earl Scruggs, Doc Watson and Ricky Skaggs team up on what has to be as good as bluegrass music gets. You will play this one again and again. This hauntingly beautiful CD reminded me once again that most of the so-called music coming out of Nashville today masquerading as \"country\" and\/or \"bluegrass\" is pure (junk). No tight jeans and cowboy hats here. Just first class music.\nThe pickers play a lot of older songs: \"What Would You Give In Exchange For Your Soul,\" \"Who Will Sing For Me,\" \"Soldier's Joy,\" \"The Storms Are On The Ocean,\" \"Foggy Mountain Top,\" \"Roll In My Sweet Baby's Arms.\" These men are as good as pickers get. Having Alison Krauss join them on some of the cuts only makes this CD better.\nDifficult as it is to pick a favorite, I would probably vote for \"Down In The Valley To Pray.\" Doc Watson begins this hymn, as simple and pure as your grandmother's pound cake, and is then joined by the voices of Skaggs and Scruggs, along with Krauss, in an a capella arrangement that will send chills down your spine. You are immediately carried back to a one-room church 50 or 60 years ago. The songleader began a hymn and then one by one, the congregation joined in while mothers fanned their babies with funeral home fans. Even though it never was, we thought life was much simpler then.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Steelheart released their sophomore record \"Tangled In Reins\" in 1992. While the chances of the record making it big were slim, that didn't stop Steelheart from cranking out a butt-kicking party rock record.\n\nI'll agree with some reviewer's here that said \"Tangled in Reins\" is not as good as the debut album. They are correct in some ways; however, this record is definitely worth adding to any pop-metal collection. With their sophomore album, Steelheart dropped some of the over-the-top campiness of the debut, and simply went for a more straight ahead rock approach. The change works well for the band on this album, and as with the debut, Michael Matijevic's vocals steal the show. \"Tangled in Reins\" doesn't have that \"I'll Never Let You Go\" type of hit on it, but the harder rocking approach adds a breath of much needed legitimacy to the band's repertoire. Songs like \"Sticky Side Up\" \"Loaded Mutha\" and \"Late for the Party\" are favorites of mine, but the rest of the album isn't totally terrible either.\n\nI would recommend this to all fans of the late 80s\/early 90s melodic rock scene. I'm sure that if anyone gave this record a couple spins they'd find something to make them smile pretty quick.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"What were Huey and the boys thinking?!? On their first album in almost a decade, they've opted to once again go the covers route, releasing a collection of Stax soul classics. Thing is, this is the band's second album of covers over their last three releases, following 1994's FOUR CHORDS & SEVERAL YEARS AGO (Their last studio album being 2001's excellent PLAN B). You would think that, with this kind of gap between releases, the group would want to offer up something that's A) a little more substantial, and B) more representative of their overall sound.\n You would also expect something with a little more punch and depth. Sadly, though, that's not the case...instead, what it boils down to is the fact that SOULSVILLE is often nothing more than bad karaoke, frequently showcasing Lewis' vocal limitations. Much like Cyndi Lauper's MEMPHIS BLUES earlier this year, the arrangements and instrumentation are impecable, but the vocals just seem to be playing catch-up at the best of times, phoned in at the worst.\n Things start out strong enough with the bopping \"Don't Fight It.\" With horns ablaze and the bassline pounding, Lewis lays down a nice, relaxed lead vocal. The underlaying vibe is one of fun and joy, with Lewis and the band obviously taking the song's words of wisdom to heart: \"You gotta feel it!\"\n \"Got To Get You Off Of My Mind\" is nice enough, what with those killer horns, tinkling piano and sweet backing vocals, but this is one of the prime examples of Lewis' lead vocal just getting lost in the mix. There's laid back...and then there's comatose!\n \"Free\" is also a major misstep...the arrangement is just O.K., the backing vocals are WAY over the top, while Lewis' lead vocal....where do I begin??? Half the time he's just trying too hard (to be sexy, to be bluesy, to be down and dirty), while the rest of the time it's all just bad acting. A definite miss!\n And then there's \"Respect Yourself\", one of my all-time favorite songs. Only slightly better than, say, Bruce Willis' version, I often find my mind wandering as I listen to the cut, wondering what a cross generational all-female cast of, oh, I don't know, Bonnie Raitt, Melissa Etheridge, Beyonce and Katy Perry, could do with this song? O.K......but nothing special.\n \"Cry To Me\" is a prime example of when the album DOES work....more doo-wop than soul, Lewis' voice is much more comfortable and at home here....it never seems forced or faked. Sterling backing vocals only add to the overall perfection. Definitely one of SOULSVILLE's high points!\n If he had just dialed down his vocals a notch or two, Lewis would have had another winner with \"Just One More Day Now.\" (Or, if he REALLY wanted to flip things, gone out on a limb and done it a cappella, with just a lone sax backing him!). As it is now, it just seems melodramatic and bloated.\n Things rebound strongly with the silky smooth \"Never Found A Girl\", which just spills out of the speakers like lusty aural lava. Lewis' lead vocal is both charming and cheeky, perfectly cushioned by the spot-on backing vocals. Toss in a crisp, understated arrangement and you have a real gem!\n Another one of the weaker cuts has to be the disc's title track....while a lyrical powerhouse, Lewis just seems out of place singing this ode to inner city living...it's almost like he's playing dress-up! Nice arrangement, strong backing vocals, great story...still, a miss.\n Things bounce back with the energetic \"Little Sally Walker\"...what a joy! Lewis isn't trying to live up to the high standards of \"classics\" here ~ he and the boys are just enjoying themselves, having fun, singing and playing for the sheer love of...well, singing and playing! One of the disc's most infectious cuts!\n The album's finest moment, however, is the doo-wop-driven \"I Want To (Do Everything For You)\"....THIS is where Huey Lewis & the News shine when it comes to re-visiting oldies! A perfect lead vocal, pristine harmonies, swinging, strong instrumentation and an overall swagger laced with equal parts rock, soul and street corner fun, it doesn't get better than this!\n Almost as nice is \"Just The One (I've Been Looking For).\" Lewis' lead vocal is rich and suppple, swooping and soaring around the lyrics, while the arrangement crackles with energy. A definite winner!\n The winning streak continues with the finger-poppin' \"Don't Let The Green Grass Fool You.\" This rave-up really gets things going, but it's never too much. Special mention has to made about the amazing horn charts, both here and throughout SOULSVILLE....this album really is a horn lover's dream come true!\n Things get a little generic once again with the by-the-numbers take on \"Never Like This Before\"....it's not that it's a bad cut, it's just not...authentic. It's like one of those old paint-by-number kits...everything fills in the correct spot, but does it REALLY look (or sound) right? Not so much.\n SOULSVILLE closes with \"Grab This Thing\", a percolating instrumental. Upon my first listen or three, I kind of thought it was a chintzy way to end things, but now I'm not so sure...I'm kind of thinking it's a nice salute to a sound and style the band obviously loves.\n And I hope they keep lovin' it. I just wish that they had mixed some of the stronger tracks here in with a heavy dose of originals...it's clear Huey Lewis & the News are still pretty much at the top of their game, but their true, more varied, inner voices seem to get lost on much of SOULSVILLE. And when we just get one record every decade or so, well, that's just not cool. (As with all my reviews, I'm docking the disc half a star for not including the lyrics).","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Whenever an artist --- any artist --- puts out a \"best-of\" set, there are always people who lash out at the concept of a \"best-of,\" and it's always the same old stuff: The \"best-of\" is unnecessary because the songs are available on their albums (and  on other \"best-ofs\"), so the \"best-of\" is purely for money. Well, I don't \"buy\" that (at least not in all cases)! A \"best-of\" can have several positive points. Sure, every artist has their die-hard fans who have all of their albums and singles, but they also have their more \"casual\" fans who like and have some of their stuff but not a lot of it (they might prefer a \"best-of\" over an album), and other die-hard fans who have most if not all of their songs but still like a good \"best-of,\" even if they already have at least one. Having a lot if not all of an artist's best songs in one set is pretty handy, especially if the set has as many songs as this one does. And, when someone doesn't have and hasn't heard any of an artist's songs but wants to give them a try, a \"best-of\" can be a good place to start. Also, some \"best-ofs\" are more up to date and\/or better than others. If someone only has one or two \"best-ofs\" by a particular artist (or none at all), and there are several of them out, then there is a good selection of them for the person to decide between (if they want any of them at all). I'm not much into country music, but I consider myself a \"casual\" Alan Jackson fan. I had the 20-song Greatest Hits Collection that came out in '95, but no other Alan Jackson CDs. Sure, 34 Number 1s has the songs that Greatest Hits has, but it also has 17 others, which are later songs than the ones on Greatest Hits. I don't mind getting songs I already have if I think that a \"best-of\" is as good as this one; I think it's even better than Greatest Hits. Alan Jackson is one of the very, very few country artists who have done even one or two songs that I really like, and he's done many (comparatively, anyway). All of them are on 34 Number 1s. Alan doesn't deserve criticism for this collection; he deserves thanks. THANKS, ALAN!!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Jewel's 0304 is a drastic change from the folk\/pop singer we all know and adore. This album is not unlistenable like others have stated, it is just very different than her previous records. But change is good and well Jewel sure had the guts to try something fun and new. Standout tracks include: the gorgeous, Sweet Temptation, the rock-out anthem, America, the sensitive, 2 Find U, and the first single, Intuition. Some of the tracks obviously do not measure up like U plus me equals love, very silly and repetitive, Stand is awkward but has cool lyrics, and the closing song Becoming is just plain boring. But i still give this album a high rating because i love Jewel, her writing, and her raspy and lovely voice. The best song of the whole bunch is track number nine, Haunted. This song is classic Jewel. \"The fury of my conviction will cause your heart to quicken..\" Just a haunting song about a man stalking a woman. I would give this record a try if you like dance songs, it is a great summer record.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"It's hard to believe that it's been more than forty years ago since Alvin Lee rocked out a crowd a half a million strong with his band, Ten Years After, at the historic Woodstock festival and, as he was leaving the stage told them, \"I'm Going Home . . . by helicopter.\"\n\nAs they say in the glorious south, Lee hasn't gotten back to the house yet and he sings about exactly that on his new solo album, Still on the Road to Freedom, returning him to his musical roots.\n\nThis album is a royal treat on so many levels:  melodically, lyrically, musically and just the fact that Lee is still producing great and memorable music. He's joined on the album with bassist Pete Pritchard, drummer Richard Newman (Rory Gallagher, Steve Marriott, Mark Knopfler) as well as keyboardist Tim Hinkley (Humble Pie, Bad Company, The Who, Thin Lizzy).\n\n\"I got my start in music listening to my dad's jazz and blues 78s when I was eight years old,\" says Lee, who continues to follow his inspirations. \"It's about the freedom to make music of my own choice without worrying about what other people thought or expected,\" he writes in the album's liner notes.\n\nThere's no freakin' way that one can pick a favorite off of this 13 tune treasure trove of inspired music.  However, I'll randomly pick three:\n\nLove Like a Man 2 is a remake of the song on the band's album, Cricklewood Green, inspired, according to Lee, by Smiley Lewis' I Hear You Knocking.  This tune alone is worth the price of the entire CD.  No foolin'!\n\nThe title cut, Still on the Road to Freedom, would have fit in quite nicely into Lee's performance at Woodstock.  Gutsy, bluesy, fluid.  This song will have you slapping the repeat button until it can't be slapped any more, it's that good.\n\nFinally, Listen to Your Radio Station, cool and funky with some great African drum work backing up Lee's silky smooth guitar work.  This song could have been times longer than it's recorded two minutes and twenty-four seconds and I still wouldn't think it was long enough. I'd love to catch Alvin performing this tune live at one of his gigs and watch him take it as far as it will go.\n\nYou have to have this CD in your collection whether you don't remember being at Woodstock or just wish you had.  This disc will wind up being on your \"desert island\" list of albums you can't ever live without.\n\nRead the Boomerocity interview with Alvin Lee at Boomerocity.com","classification":5,"fold":8}

For Fifth Harmony, they haven't been able to deliver at the vocals for the past few years.

{"text":"TON returns to inject a major dose of truly exceptional musick into the basilar membrane which is both empowering and contemplative, considering the Rasputin theme and aestheics as well. The lyrical theme is entirely seperate to the aesthetic, which makes them both distinct unto themselves:\n\nMusick\n\nTrack List: 1. Dead Again 2. Tripping A Blind Man 3. The Profits Of Doom 4. September Sun 5. Halloween in Heaven 6. These Three Things 7. She Burned Me Down 8. Some Stupid Tomorrow 9. An Ode To Locksmiths 10. Hail And Farewell To Britain\n\nDead Again preserves their evocatively best style, with rhythmically crunching and echoing guitars, haunting cathedral keyboards, the darkly erotic inunciations and deep reverberations from Peter Steele, and the hypnotic beat of the drums all combine to create another Goth-Metal masterpiece akin to Bloody Kisses. As is typical TON, each song takes its time, coursing and describing the emotions, while stimulating a sense of sweet euphoria.\n\nOf note, The Profit of Doom, dealing with The Antichrist Beast of Revelation complete with references to the six triumverate; Halloween In Heaven, a jaunty tune featuring a female voice {Tara VanFlower of Lycia} complimenting Steele's well with a pleasing contrast. September Sun, & These Three Things combine ponderous ballad moments with sudden bursts of energy creating a perfect mix of melancholy and rage.\n\nAlso, I was pleasantly surprised to find an additional disc contained inside with a Live recording featuring tracks from Bloody Kisses {Christian Woman, Love You To Death, Black No. 1}, October Rust {Everything Dies \/ My Girlfriend's Girlfriend}, Slow Deep & Hard, {Gravitational Constant}, and Origin of The [...]{Are You Afraid}, all of which sounds extraordinary.\n\nOverall, Dead Again contains a mutiplicity of content from the art {even the thorny vines on the CD itself is a very nice touch} to the quantity of music, which hearkens to Bloody Kisses and October Rust while standing upon its own merit. Highly recommended.\n\nAesthetics\n\nThe cover art features Grigori Efimovich Rasputin, Mystic, so called \"Holy Devil\" and \"Mad Monk\", deriving from The Khlysty, a sect who practiced self-flagellation, although he disagreed with their masochistic methods and basically became a renegade monk with a penchant for carnal indulgence - from imbibing in copious libations, passionate dance {it was rumored that he even celebrated a phallic cavort with the legendary ample appendage} , to sensual pleasures with many of the local women who admired his extraordinary abilities, as well as his libertine lifestyle, in which he revelled, and was more than willing and able to satisfy on a frequent basis.\n\nHis influence pervaded the Russian Aristocracy, wherein he had the Czar and Czarina transfixed. Briefly, extremely fortunate for them, he attained the power to heal, and used that ability to cure the Czar's son Alex, which gained their unyielding loyalty. From the beginning, there were those who resented him, claiming he was in league with The Devil. Through treachorous subterfuge, he was tricked and betrayed, and eventually excarnated after displaying apparent invincibility, to the fear and trepidation of his detractors.\n\nHe lived his life to the fullest, attained a passionate joie de vivre, employing lesser magic principles to charm and confound when it served his purposes, and excelled in his chosen endeavors, all of which designates him a de-facto Satanist, in My estimation.\n\nThe back cover features the images of Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia and Alex, the unfortunate royal children who were assassinated {with the exception of Maria, who would later write a book entitled \"Rasputin: The Man Behind The Myth\"} in Yekaterinburg (Sverdlovsk) on 16th July 1918, by the filthy hands of stuporstitious peasants wanting to rid the kingdom of anything to do with Rasputin. The ignorant frightened cowards.\n\nThe green font used on the entire album can be a bit distracting, which is something of a Russian version of the English alphabet, with several reversed letters. Also mentionable, the booklet is a fold-out cross design containing full lyrics and liner notes.","classification":5,"fold":8}

And Abbey Simon is just a superb virtuoso who plays this fiendishly difficult music with passion and confidence.\n\nThe sonics are very good - fine detail without sacrificing ambiance and stereo spatial clues.\n\nAnd at the VoxBox price, it pretty much goes without saying that this is a no-brainer.","classification":5,"fold":8}

My Mom would have the radio on and I would lay down and watch as the various neon lights of fast food chains were reflected on the window. We might head to McDonalds for some 'food' or a 'milkshake'. There is a down to earth late night quality to this song, the reverb on the vocals and music, the simple jangly guitar chords, the drum fills. I always liked the name-checking of the various cities in the US - Phoenix, Tacoma, Philadelphia, Atlanta, LA. When I got older I often wondered why Tacoma was included, since it's way smaller than the other ones. I thought it might have been a nod to the Tacoma Dome, but that wasn't constructed until 1983. It must be that it sort of rhymes with Arizona. Arizona - Tacoma - Oklahoma - Bologna. Catchy stuff, Steve Miller. He includes all of northern California in his lyrics. Why limit himself to one city when 'the girls are warm' in an entire area? There were probably a lot of girls in northern Cali who heard this song and thought, \"Hey, I live in northern California and I'm warm. He's singing about me!\"","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Hard to believe that it has been over 30 years since Sting had started his successful solo career, after he had said goodbye to The Police. Honestly, the songs that Sting has done on his own all this time, absolutely stand taller than just the days of Punk he had with Stewart and Andy. Sting has made some really remarkable songs, and they are definitely much better than the jokes that are on radio today, who do not even have a sliver of the soul that Sting has had for years in music. One of my favorite songs Sting came out with back in the 90's, Desert Rose is one of those melodic and spiritual songs that still is very upbeat and hypnotic to the soul that still sounds just as driven today, as you would expect from Sting himself. I have loved this song for years, and it still strikes at the heart of the matter as one of his best songs ever. It is just too sad that the stars of today, well the overexposed jokes of Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna, cannot even have a single song that can drive from the bloom of the flower like Sting has. If you have never even heard a Sting song before, well this is one of my Top 5 picks from his illustrious works of art that I suggest that you do go to.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":8}

Harrison and McCartney. I think George's stuff here could have been freeze-dried for a hearty repast on any number of 1963-64 Beatles l.p.s. \"Crying, Wating, and Hoping\" is beautiful - as usual the guys do an exceptional take on Buddy Holly. Paul's \"Besame Mucho\" (improved by June, 1962; see Anthology I.) has inrrestistible nervous energy on this January, 1962 try.\n\nThe big reason I bought this CD are the three Lennon and McCartney compositions, \"Like Dreamers Do\", \"Hello, Little Girl\", and \"Love of the Loved\", which originally arrived via Beatles' friends' discs. \"Dreamers\" might catch the extra attention of Roy Orbison fans, as the title sings out the same phrase from Roy's Classic, \"In Dreams\".\n\nSound is very good, not great - VG is not up to standards.

{"text":"It is with both hope and sorrow that we welcome Sevendust's seventh studio album. Sorrow, for the band has parted ways with guitarist Sonny Mayo not even a week prior to the album's release. Hope, however, that with original guitarist Clint Lowery back in the fold, that the band will stop rushing out albums so quickly and take their time to put out a stunning chapter eight.\n\nTruth is, listening to Sevendust is like getting together with old friends. There's a certain sense of comfort, of knowing what to expect. More or less, Sevendust haven't drastically altered their sound over the years. Each album has been marked with a significant growth, but not enough to turn off the fanbase. It should come as no surprise, then, that \"Chapter VII: Hope & Sorrow\" -- rushed out 13 months after \"Alpha\" -- has the band going through the motions. Usually, with two years between albums, any band can come up with something that is both satisfying and refreshing. Being the first time Sevendust have released two albums so closely together, it is also the first time they have fallen short of expectations.\n\nThat's not to say that their seventh effort is a bad one. It's a totally listenable album, especially for the faithful fan, but there is nothing here that hasn't been done already on the previous six efforts. It's got a strong start with the intense \"Inside\" -- which would make a perfect set opener for their upcoming tour -- and songs like \"Hope\" and the groovy first single, \"Prodigal Son,\" stray from the \"Alpha\" formula, turning out to be the most interesting tracks. In fact, the main problem with this album is that it's basically \"Alpha\" redux. Had they taken more time to tour with that album and record this material, we might have something a little more interesting to listen to. Then again, if they had waited, Sonny wouldn't have gotten his part in this, his closing chapter with the band. But I digress.\n\nIn an attempt to up the ante (and perhaps have a bid at rock radio success) the help of American Idol's Chris Daughtry and Alter Bridge's Miles Kennedy and Mark Tremonti is enlisted. Tremonti's contribution to \"Hope\" is definitely a highlight, but Miles and Daughtry both seem to have trouble meshing with Lajon's vocal style. These collaborations have nothing on the likes of Skin, Chino Moreno or even Aaron Lewis, and each respective singer tends to overpower their song. Definitely a downer. Overall, the album isn't terrible, nor does it have vultures circling above the band's head. It's just a slight mis-step is all. Hopefully with the original line-up intact, the next chapter in the band's story will be a more exciting one.","classification":3,"fold":8}

Everything from Johnny Has Gone To Soldier to Git Along Little Dogies.  i had never heard some of these songs like Shady Grove and All The Pretty Little Horses.  Her voice suits songs like Erie Canal, Shenandoah,and Wayfaring Stranger.  She does very well on Froggy Went A-Courtin and Ol' Dan Tucker.

I can truly say that there's not one dud track on this album and even those songs that I'm not ecstatic about, like \"Flinch\", \"That Particular Time\" and \"A Man\" have memorable tunes, good lyrics and interesting arrangements. My favorites include the poignant \"So Unsexy\", the rousing \"Surrendering\" and the powerful \"21 Things\", and I love the pure pop delight of \"Precious Illusions\" and \"Utopia.\" If you liked the \"Infatuation\" album, you'll certainly enjoy this one.

{"text":"When it has came down to Madonna, musically she has had a lot of challenges to show her voice to a whole new generation. Musically, all the hype she had brought out, turned out to be a absolute failure with her album MDNA. Her lead single from her latest work, and her first after leaving Warner Brother Give Me All Your Lovin' isn't exactly a driven song. It feels like and sounds like Madonna doesn't actually have anything to prove within her voice and sound, especially when trying to reinvent herself for a whole new generation of fans. I think she could've brought more into the song, and doesn't feel like convincing from her voice alone. Hopefully, there is better songs from her to give all your loving to.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":8}

{"text":"The Drive-By Truckers have been energized in opposition to racism in America.  This is a powerful album, both lyrically and musically.\n\nThe Truckers' music is not as rowdy and rocking as it was in the time of Decoration Day (2003) and The Dirty South (2004) -- the band has matured and grown more reflective.  Patterson Hood wrote and sings six songs, and Mike Cooley wrote and sings five songs.  The Stonesy rockers are, as usual, provided by Mike Cooley:  \"Ramon Casiano\" and \"Surrender Under Protest,\" which address immigration, the NRA, the Civil War, and the Confederate flag.  Cooley's songs also deal with hypocritical right-wing preachers (Kinky Hypocrite) and Clear Channel's ban on its radio stations playing \"Imagine\" in late 2001 (Once They Banned Imagine).\n\nHood sings about race and the police in the anguished \"What It Means?,\" the emotional center of the album, as well as gun violence (Guns of Umpqua).  \"Ever South\" is an epic tale of the immigration of the Scots-Irish to the U.S., to the South, and Hood's own continued move West to Portland, Oregon.  He embraces his new home in \"Sun Don't Shine.\"  In short, the band continues to speak, as it always has, from the standpoint of white Southerners critical of the prevailing culture of white Southerners.\n\nIn the wake of Bob Dylan winning the Nobel Prize for Literature, we can be thankful that Dylan blazed the trail for other songwriters to create songs at a high level of artistry like Hood and Cooley.\n\nI just saw them live for the first time 11\/19\/16 in Atlanta with their Black Lives Matter sign on stage -- great concert!","classification":5,"fold":8}

We all know that Cher has made herself a star, when she and Sonny were a recording duo, as well as the stars of their television career. During that time, Cher had a solo career on the side. She has released the albums, ALL I REALLY WANT TO DO (1965), THE SONNY SIDE OF CHER (1966), CHER (1966), BACKSTAGE (1967), & WITH LOVE, CHER (1968). In 1969, Cher had released her fifth album entitled, 3614 JACKSON HIGHWAY. Now, this album really isn't what I had hoped for. Cher's music from the 60s was not all too great, but don't forget that Cher was still concentrating on her career with Sonny, so this album deserves more credit than people give it.\n\nFOR WHAT IT'S WORTH\n\n  Not bad.\n\n(JUST TO KEEP ME) HANGIN' ON\n\n  I usually love songs, where half of the title is enclosed in paranthesis, where the first half or the second half.

David Guetta is one reason, with his many collaborations.

{"text":"\"Healing Hearts\" is the fourth solo piano release from Louis Landon in less than two years, an indication that his 2013 move to Sedona, AZ sparked an amazing creative streak for him. Since his move, Landon has established Healing Piano of Sedona which offers a unique sound healing experience to create mental, physical and emotional well-being. Landon is a Steinway Artist who has toured internationally and has released seventeen albums, eleven of which are solo piano (one is a best of). He has been using the techniques of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky for spiritual development since 1980. Healing Piano of Sedona was created to help people live life joyously, passionately, stress- and disease-free.\n\nThe thirteen tracks on \"Healing Hearts\" were created spontaneously to assist individuals in their emotional and spiritual well-being. I have to admit that in the past, I have had a strong preference for Landons more composed music, but he is improvising and performing so much now that his spontaneous music is incredibly cohesive and complete and the emotional content is rich and sincere. Landon has performed house concerts in my series every year for the past seven years and while his music has always been exceptionally good, now its often breathtaking in its beauty and honesty. Nothing is held back, coming from the purest source of creativity. Im blown away by the music on \"Healing Hearts\" and am certain that it will be the second of Landons albums on my Favorites list for 2014.\n\nMost of the tracks overflow with peace and serenity. In fact, Louis calls his home studio The Peace Palace and I can see why! A couple of pieces are a bit livelier, but the entire album is perfect for a warm and soothing background. However, be sure to treat your mind and soul to a blissful hour of calming music that can effortlessly heal the spirit and wash away the cares of the moment, the day, or life in general - at least for a while.\n\nAll of the tracks are exceptional, but Ill mention a few favorites. Amys Song is a breath of fresh air - graceful, tender and very warm. Gorgeous! Desert Peace is somewhat more ambient and so peaceful. I love the title track, which is more minor and a bit darker, but so poignant and compelling. Now or Never seems to be offering support and encouragement to move forward - gently but firmly. Sacred is almost hymn-like. The Great Unknown is dedicated to a young family member who passed away recently. Dark and sometimes painfully sad, there is hope as the healing process takes place - an amazing piece of music! The Painter expresses the passionate spirit that can flow from one artist to another. Unstoppable begins quietly and simply, gradually building energy, strength and power. Unstoppable, indeed! A great, upbeat ending to a fantastic album!\n\n\"Healing Hearts\" is a must-hear! Very highly recommended!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Like many metal fans, my TSO fandom is deeply rooted in their association to the criminally underrated band Savatage.  TSO is the remaining Savatage members, the producer\/main songwriter, Paul O'Neill, along with a bunch of additional musicians and of course, an orchestra.  The music and story concepts are basically in the same vein as they were in Savatage, but a bit more orchestral with the metal toned down a bit.  Basically TSO is Savatage-lite.  Paul O'Neill basically started TSO on a kind of whim in order to deliver a holiday themed album based on the success of a Savatage song.  While a very musically talented group, it always seemed like a halfassed project that got lucky(Jon Oliva has even said himself that he does this band to basically pay the bills.  His role anymore in TSO is basically just playing keyboards).  Now, Paul devotes all his time to TSO and basically left Savatage to more or less fade away to a footnote in heavy metal history.  Doesn't seem quite fair, but at least Savatage lives on to a certain degree.  TSO has always been looked at as a seasonal kind of event, an annual tradition to take the family to when they swing through your hometown.  So, TSO has been a holiday household name ever since.  I'm not sure how well Beethoven's Last Night sold, but it was very refreshing to see a TSO album on the shelves that wasn't Christmas themed.  Not that I have anything against the Christmas albums, but who throws The Christmas Attic in their cd player in mid July?  It was cool to see TSO become a band that wasn't strictly associated with one specific time of the year.\nThat brings us to Night Castle, an album which has been in the works for what seems like 800 years now(they played songs from it when I saw them in 2004!).  All this anticipation will undoubtedly create high expectations, which is kind of a curse coz you really can't live up to it(Phantom Menace anyone?).\nWell, Night Castle's sound is what you pretty much expect it to be.  But honestly, I find myself getting kinda bored of it after awhile.  I love orchestral and progressive rock\/metal, but there's too much of a sameness to this.  The story isn't bad, but it's a little lacking, especially when compared to O'Neill's previous stories. I can't honestly say it's bad musically-it's actually very good-it's just a bit monotonous, not much variance at all.  It's missing something.  Also, as many have said before, a bunch of Savatage tunes are used here as well, mostly instrumental.  I suppose I don't have too much of an issue with this, after all they are O'Neill's songs, but it just seems a bit cheap to fill space with songs that have been done before, especially for an album that has been in the works this long.  This is a bit irritating to me on Disc 2 with the bonus track, \"Believe\", one of the most cherished of Savatage songs from the album Streets.  I'm not sure why this was done at all coz most would agree that you simply cannot touch that song.  As far as \"Believe\" goes, Savatage vocalist Jon Oliva is what made a great song a friggin phenomenal and unforgettable song.  Oliva's performance will damn near make your eyes tear up.  No disrespect to vocalist Tim Hockenberry, who does the TSO version, but he just doesn't hold a candle to Oliva.  It actually sounds alot like Joe Cocker singing \"Believe\".  TSO's vocalists have never been all that great.  Not bad singers by any means(at least they sing, a rare thing anymore), but they've always sounded(to me anyway) like weaker and clumsier versions of Zak Stevens.\nIn all honesty, it seriously pains me to have to say anything negative about this album, especially considering that in today's music mainstream, \"music\" is more or less a four letter word.  But on the other hand, because of this rarity and also my fandom, I can't just simply give the album nothing but praise and say it's a masterpiece.  That wouldn't be honest.

{"text":"When the news broke a few years ago that non other than electronic music legends Daft Punk were going to score the music for the \"Tron\" 2010 reboot, it raised a lot of expectations among Daft Punk fans.\n\n\"Tron: Legacy\" (22 tracks; 59 min.) starts off with the \"Overture\" (of course), followed by \"The Grid\", the only spoken-piece on this (featuring Jeff Bridges). But shortly after that, we are into a full-blown symphonic soundtrack, in which the electronic music is kept to a minimum (but for a few exceptions, more on that later). The general tone of the soundtrack is quite dark and threatening and the London Orchestra shines throughout. It culminates for me in tracks 9 \"Outlands\", with fantasic orchestral interplay, and 10 \"Adagio for Tron\", featuring a beautifully pensive orchestra. The \"true\" Daft Punk sound only comes in a couple of tracks from the nightclub scene in the movie (and in which the guys from Daft Punk make a hilarious brief appearance--when I saw it for the first time, I blurted out to myself \"OMG, there's Daft Punk!\").\n\nIn all, I quite enjoy this soundtrack more than I expected, but then again I love classical music and symphonic movie soundtracks. I have to say that I have been bewildered by the praise from many Daft Punk fans for this release, as this truly has nothing to do with the \"usual\" Daft Punk music, but to which I can only say that there are lots of other worthy symphonic soundtracks out there worth checking out, if that is really your thing. For the Daft Punk fans who want the \"true\" Daft Punk sound, check out instead the \"Tron: Legacy Reconfigured\" album. Last but not least, a shoutout to my son, who bought this for me as a gift some time ago, for no reason (other than knowing I would like this), just because he felt like it. Thanks Rick!","classification":4,"fold":8}

Showcased with a more exhilarating and melodic sound,\n  The Killers again hit the album charts with their second album Sams Town (taking the\n  name from Sams Town Hotel And Gambling Hall, a popular casino that band member\n  Mark Stoermer visited regularly in his teens) as it feature outstanding songwriting from\n  Brandon Flowers, the bands co-leader, where he broadens his songwriting abilities as\n  he follows in the footsteps of Bruce Springsteen and John Mellencamp, but leaves his\n  indelible mark for catchy melodies.  Beginning with the title track, the superlative track\n  set proceed with other timeless tracks, like the sweeping mid-tempo rock ballad When\n  We Were Young (abeited with its sweet solo piano interlude), For Reasons Unknown,\n  Read My Mind, This River Is Wild and the final track Why Do I Keep Counting?, which\n  make Sams Town another critical and commercial triumph which Flowers deliberately\n  lend his conceptual quality, as Hot Fuss and Sams Town solidify Flowers standing as\n  one of the greatest and most original rock composers ever to come on the rock scene\n  in a while. The album even have a serious side as the band put a spotlight on several\n  dark tunes like Uncle Johnny (about a drug addict on his downward spiral), while rest\n  of the album take a bold look on the bright side of life, whom The Killers handles with\n  excellent rapport and terrific skill.

The band is tighter than ever heavier than ever and the gutiar riffs are sickiest of any band I've heard in awhile. But after listening to this album a couple of times something just seems to be missing. Its probably heavier than they been since Iowa and with  the production of the first album that sort of at times reminds me of the first album but more mature. But where are the big chorus and catchy melodies that the other albums had. Where are the wait and bleeds, or the psycho socials or before I forgot songs. Don't get me wrong I love their deep cuts too but this album sort of seems rushed to me and its sort of tainted the quality of the music.

{"text":"Im still convinced that Tim McGraw is better than some of the single choices hes chosen over the past couple of years.  Two Lanes of Freedom was easily one of the best mainstream albums of 2013, despite Truck Yeah.  And Southern Girl wasn't an awful song, but there were much better single choices to be made off of the album which meant that two of the four singles off of the album were solid choices, with an album full of great tracks.  It was a great album, pure and simple.\n\nWhich made it so frustrating when the first single off of Sundown Heaven Town was Lookin For That Girl, an auto-tuned faux-rap mess of a song.  Not long after, McGraw redeemed himself with the spectacular Meanwhile Back at Mamas and now, the third single, Shotgun Rider, (curiously, the second time McGraw has recorded a song with that title) is another solid choice off of the album, another one filled with great tracks amid a few duds.\nThere is a lot of great material here from City Lights to Diamond Rings and Old Barstools (featuring McGraws cousin Catherine Dunn) to Last Turn Home.\n\nIn Diamond Rings and Old Barstools, McGraw sings that of those two, one is for queens and one is for fools.  I guess some things don't mix as well as you hoped \/ like me and you \/ and diamond rings and old barstools.  And in Last Turn Home McGraw compares the love of a good woman to that great feeling of coming back with the metaphor that shes the last turn home.\n\nDont believe that everything is great.  It still features Lookin For That Girl, which if it weren't for the fact of how bad it was would be forgotten by most of us by nowit really never made an impact on the radio (which may have had a lot to do with the fan response to the ACM performance of Meanwhile Back at Mamas leading to a quick release of it as a single).  And Keep O Truckin is a number suggesting, in an obviously clichd way, that we push on through adversity and tough times.  Not a bad message, if not somewhat overdone, but even the style of the song is still clichd and McGraw is way better than the song.\n\nDust isn't the greatest song on the album, but theres also nothing particularly offensive about it.  Its a mainly forgettable track that will be unlikely to be released as a single, nor should it be.\n\nStill on the Line is the album closer (if you don't pick up the deluxe edition) and is another solid country tune where one old love calls another.\n\nIf you spring for the deluxe version, youll receive five bonus tracks, including Lincoln Continentals and Cadillacs, a duet with Kid Rock.  Its hard to understand why this ended up as a deluxe edition only track.  Youd figure that bringing in Kid Rock for a duet would merit putting the track on the standard version of the album, not necessarily for its quality, but because its a duet that requires bringing another performer into the studio.  Its not a bad song, and Kid Rock doesnt turn the song into a rap, nor does McGraw.  Its a solid up-tempo song.  Kids Today explores that kids today may want different things than their parents did at that age but that they're very much the same and theres nothing wrong with them.\n\nMcGraw shows again on this album that hes still one of the most talented male vocalists still recording and touring in the genre.  Hes definitely at his best when hes singing slower to mid-tempo songs.  But hes still capable of making great country music.  Perhaps thats been forgotten as a result of some of those earlier mentioned single choices.\n\nLets hope that with all the strong material on that album that the right singles are chosen to start to make country radio listenable again.\n\nFollow opinions and commentary on country music at hopeforcountrymusic.weebly.com","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"There is honestly so much that I can say about the lack of diversity in music today. There are some songs worth their effort, while there are others that could be better overall for their time and their money. When Uptown Funk came out with Bruno Mars last year, Mark Ronson who produced for others like Duran Duran, really hit the jackpot in regards to having a massive hit, and a song that really sounded better than most of the jokes in music today. But for him to try and follow-up what he did with Bruno so well, has been more of a tough challenge in his heart. His second single with Mystikal on Feel Right, doesn't actually ignite as strongly as Uptown Funk did. It does follow more of that James Brown-style beat with his rapping doesn't follow in strong strides. It isn't a bad song, just not completely over the top in regards to real rhythm. It is a decent follow-up for Mark's Uptown Special album, but just could've been better.\n\nSong: C 1\/2+","classification":3,"fold":8}

After seeing her perform on the Grammy's, I just had to get this cd cause I liked the song \"Rehab\" and \"You Know I'm No Good.\"\n\nAs for the rest of the cd, well I was in for a nice surprise...\n\nWinhouse's vocals are soulful, sultry and strong, sounding a lot like Shirley Bassey in her prime. I can totally imagine her doing a remake of \"Gold Finger.\"\n\nAnd the music is a great blend of 60s girl-group, soul & motown all working together creating a unique sound not found on contemporary artists' cds.\n\nOn the title song \"Back to Black\" it sounds like there's a sample of the Supremes \"Baby Love\" and there's even shades of Burt Bacharach on \"Love Is A Losing Game\" (think \"Walk On By\").\n\nAlthough definitely tinged with a 60s-mod-rock-motown-dowop-girl group sound, BACK TO BLACK doesn't sound dated or out-of-synch with today. I think Ms. Winehouse might start a 60s revival, yet!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"This may be Nirvana's most famous album but it is also thier most commercial. Instead of the sludgy heavy production that greeted thier muisic with Bleach, this was lighter, crisper, cleaner and generally more radio-friendly. Some of the songs are excellent, but if this album had the production of Bleach, it would have been amazing. Many people rave about this album, whilst some people (even hardened Nirvana fans) moan about how it is thier least favourite album.\nAt first I loved it. Now I can't even remember the last time I listened to it. Just listen to the live version of Smell Like Teen Spirit - it's a million times better and contained all the angst, aggression and sheer energy that this album should've had. At the end of the day, this \"classic rock album\" fails to stike a chord with the people it REALLY should, and those people are a large amount of true Nirvana fans worldwide.\nLastly Cobain was not a genius.... Almost all of his songs had the same structures and the lryics don't mean anything most of the time (something else HE said in an interview).  If Nirvana didn't have so much commercial appeal and he didn't kill himself then they wouldn't be anymore popular than most other grunge bands.

{"text":"Last week I found another phenomenal classical music bargain at Amazon.com: Haydn: Complete String Quartets on the VoxBox label. Featuring the Dekany Quartet and the Fine Arts Quartet, this splendid MP3 album contains nearly 24 hours of Franz Joseph Haydns string quartets, all brilliantly performed by the two ensembles mentioned above.\n\nThis MP3 VoxMegaBox Edition contains all of the string quartets in Haydns oeuvre, including some that are credited to him that he may not have composed. The works are placed in opus number order, from earliest to latest, so listeners can hear the progression of Haydns musical thinking and development over his many decades of composing in this genre.\n\nThe Dekany Quartet plays just over half of the 70-plus works that appear on this album, and the Fine Arts Quartet plays the remainder. The musicianship of these two ensembles is exquisite throughout. They consistently engage their instruments in those finely balanced musical conversations that make well-played string quartets such a joyful listening experience for me. Their interpretations are flawless, showing every bit of the emotion and intellect that Haydn wrote into each one of his chamber music masterworks. There are some subtle differences between the two ensembles in tone, texture, and color, but overall, I find it difficult to tell them apart.\n\nThe audio quality on Haydn: Complete String Quartets is crisp, clean, and precise. My ears can easily detect each of the four lines playing in every string quartet. On rare occasions, the first violin sounds a trifle over-bright, but this in no way detracts from my overall listening pleasure.\n\nWhen Haydn: Complete String Quartets first came out at Amazon.com in 2015, it apparently sold for $2.99  an extraordinary bargain. Now, even at over three times that price ($9.49), I think it remains one of the best classical music values to be found anywhere. Its low price, combined with its exquisite performances and exceptional audio quality, makes it a must-have in every digital classical music library. Most highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Note: this review applies specifically to the CD and its musical content, I have not seen the DVD.\n\nI was fortunate to receive an advanced copy of Fly from Here the new album by Yes, and it is a masterpiece! The album itself has a timeless quality about it, and is a pleasure to listen to.\nTrevor Horn ex-lead singer for Yes is once again with the band as strictly a producer\/cowriter, and the product is brilliant.\nNote: (Trevor Horn replaced Jon Anderson as lead vocalists in the band for the Drama album exclusively, as well as the tour in support of the album).\n This release also marks the debut of Benot David the new lead singer for Yes, and I have to say I am extremely impressed with his vocals. David appears to sometimes sound a bit like Anderson, but more like Horn, so much so that at times one might think they were listening to something from Drama that was never released. That in fact is not far from the truth, as the title track \"Fly from Here\" an epic six part piece is based on a demo from 1980 entitled \"We Can Fly from Here\". Having expanded the demo track into the epic it now is was a fantastic idea, and it works mainly due to Benot David's vocal similarity to Trevor Horn. The other five tracks are primarily stand-alone tunes and are beautifully written and performed by the band as a whole. Rejoining Yes for Fly from Here is yet another member of the band from the Drama album, on keyboards completely outdoing himself is Geoff Downes, and Geoff is at the top of his game, and is refreshing to hear performing at his progressive rock peak. Longtime Yes members Chris Squire , Alan White, and Steve Howe are also in rare form, especially throughout the six part \"Fly from Here\".\nThis album signifies a new beginning for Yes, and brings us some closure from the days of Drama (one of my favorite albums), as well as opening the future for the band building on the Drama sound and taking it to an entirely new level. Fly from Here in many ways is the follow-up to Drama ,that we as Yes fans never got, and although many fans may refuse to accept any other singer then Jon Anderson, get over it! Change can be a good thing, and in the case of Fly from Here an exceptional musical experience!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Most popular singers can attest to that one album that is considered by fans and critics alike as being their apex.  Michael Jackson had \"Thriller,\" Prince had \"Purple Rain,\" and Mary J. had the multi-Grammy-winning \"The Breakthrough.\"  It is unfair to the singers to always compare each successive release with its predecessor for the artists may have different directions and concepts that they wish to pursue.\n\nMary J, though traveling some of the same roads as her previous works, branches out somewhat with \"Growing Pains\" with an album that is possibly more pop-oriented than anything that she has previously done, including \"The Breakthrough.\"\n\n\"Growing Pains\" is a bit of everything that will, no doubt, increase her already large fan base.  Riding high on the strength of the first single \"Just Fine\" and its eye-popping video, the album is a well-crafted blend of R & B, funk, pop, and female angst and strength that can only be done by Miss Mary.\n\nEVERY single song is a winner and each makes a seamless segue to its successor.\n\nBesides that, she looks MIGHTY FINE on every photo in the liner notes!\n\nWe all should grow so well!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"After nearly 25 years of releasing singles and cds, the PET SHOP BOYS are proving once again that they are only getting better as time passes. Listening to FORMAT, I am struck by the number of excellent songs that are as good if not better to some of the tracks that they have released as singles. For example the duet with Elton John \"In Private\" works really well as an upbeat pop number and \"Blue on Blue\" is classic Euro Hi-NRG.\n\nAnother hidden gem is \"We're the Pet Shop Boys\" which is their cover of a song first released by My Robot Friend and then most recently by Robbie Williams. What group do you know of, has done a cover of a song that pokes fun or is about themselves done by someone else? You will love this song with all the references to PSB classic hits...\n\nDo not be distracted by the fact that some of these tracks were originally made several years back. For example, \"The Boy Who Couldn't Keep His Clothes On\" (produced in 1997) could have been played at this year's WORLD MUSIC CONFERENCE in Miami and would have received great praise. It helps of course, that it was produced by Danny Tenaglia and has a great 4\/4 House beat.\n\nDie hard fans like myself might not enjoy every single song but with a choice of 38 tracks, there is tons of material to savour.\n\nFor me, cd 2 is much stronger. Overall, here you get all the songs that previously were only available as expensive import only cd or dvd or in the case of \"We're all criminals now\" digital download (Hence the title of the cd - FORMAT) only for the cost of a regular double cd. Well worth it!\n\nI only wished other bands put out such b-side or alternative compilations.

{"text":"The heroes in a half shell have had a long and prosperous life in film and television. Im one of the millions of kids who grew up with the original trilogy. I ran around with chopsticks taped to my back as you do when you're 4, pretending to be a ninja turtle. The turtles have been revamped before, and not too long ago hit theaters as an animated feature. The great thing about this ever-lasting franchise is that they have no musical identity (maybe the original TV theme song and Vanilla Ice sadly) so it becomes an open canvas for a composer. I mean, how many of you remember John Du Prezs scores for the original trilogy? Or even Klaus Badelts awesome score for TMNT in 2007? The scores worked in the moment, but never became attached to these characters, and this allowed for Tyler to build a simply damn awesome orchestral action score from scratch.\n\nBrian Tyler reunites with director Jonathan Liebesman for their fourth feature together here. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is simply just a fantastic orchestral approach to the typical summer studio tentpole. Everything about this score moves with fluidity, intensity, awe and a warm heroic glow. A simple theme acts as the lifeline of the score. It carries the weight of the films much larger action scope with ease. It can turn one way and feel heavy and dramatic, but it can also flip to be uplifting and heroic. Tyler affectionately refers to it as the TMNT March. The whole score is nothing really complicated, it propels the action and gives it an old school adventure vibe. Parts of it reminded me of Jerry Goldsmiths The Mummy, it had that kind of adventure spirit. Some parts also reminded me of Hans Zimmers Man Of Steel, mostly Zimmers main theme and the track Terraforming. Tylers action writing is not too different from Zimmer though, they do approach things similarly which is fun because their stylistic approaches are very different. Even if there was a little case of temp track hangover, Tylers Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is its own fun ride. Its melodically charged and gives the film a big adrenaline rush without being contrived or unnecessarily loud. The flow of the adventure is so smooth, and with long tracks you get a feel for the scores structure. The theme is used a lot, but I never got a one-note type feel. The only thing lacking is some emotional and structural depth.\n\nBrian Tylers Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is all types of fun. Its a great action score done in that great orchestral fashion that Tyler is known for. A simple theme holds the dramatic weight of the film, plus adds heroic flare. You won't find deep emotions or anything much beyond the main theme, but thats all the score needs to do here. There are plenty of great moments, superb action builds and the music flows with ease. The score delivers all that you need in order to watch this incarnation of the turtles fighting the baddies in an action extravaganza.\n\nKaya Savas for filmmusicmedia.com","classification":4,"fold":8}

It's definitely one of my Top 10 favorite albums this year.\n\nNot having heard the band's previous albums, I can't offer any comparisons or make a guess as to how they\/he have progressed or matured as a songwriter or performer. All I can tell you is that these songs abound with hooks and good grooves and lovely harmonies. These songs float and soar and lift the spirits. Some definite synth-pop magic at work on this album. I'll throw a curveball in the way of comparison and say that some of these songs remind me of New Musik's wonderful \"Straight Lines\" album from the early 1980s, albeit with a more modern production touch.\n\nThis album was definitely not what I expected, and perhaps that helps to make me love it even more. Shimmering would be my one word to describe these songs. I'm so impressed by this album that I'm going to go back and give \"Lonerism\" a try too.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Much as it was somewhat intimidating when first eyeballing the recorded catalogs of Stevie Wonder and Miles Davis when I was younger,a similar reaction occurred when eyeballing the breadth and scope of Nina Simone's music. At a time when the world of protest music was largely expressed through folk singers such as Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs,Nina Simone was one of the very few people to write and sing about the social concerns of the civil rights movement from an insiders perspective. Her distinctive musical style led the way for many generations of jazz and soul music,from the 70's funk era up to the socially aware end of the hip-hop\/neo-soul scene today. Interestingly enough,she did all of this by being something of a creative non conformist. So this is the first Nina Simone album I ever put my hands on. And here's how I see it.\n\n  Conceptually this album is quite literal as she explores the blues. This is a genre she might have been mildly embarrassed about. Yet she understood it's true purpose to such a strong degree that \"Do I Move You\",her own composition that starts out the album in a manner that she has a full command of the form and authenticity of it's message. On \"Day And Night\",her own \"I Want A Little Sugar In My Bowl\",\"Buck\" and  the ballad \"Since I Feel For You\" she is throwing down some heavy soul with the likes of musicians Eric Gale and Bernard Purdie. Her lyrical and vocal expression reflect both personal and physical longing in almost equal measure. On \"Backlash Blues\" she's back to the 12 bar end of things. Co-written with Langston Hughes,this song realistically deals with the socio-economic inequities bought on from racism that,sadly we're still very much dealing with in the present day.\n\n  While that is a personal favorite of mine here,another is her take of \"House Of The Rising Sun\",interpreted with the full gospel power of the sanctified church and not the typically folksy take on the song whatsoever. She ends the album with \"Blues For Mama\",her collaboration with Abbey Lincoln dealing with unfaithful and abusive men. Of the bonus tracks,the standout for me is the uptempo soul of \"Whatever I Am,You Made Me\". Much as with Miles Davis,the in your face assertiveness of Nina Simone pours out through your brash and sometimes howling vocal instrument and projects an attitude that may not be everyone's cup of tea. However for those who hunger for the soul laid bare,Nina Simone stands out among the Etta James and Aretha Franklin's of her era for her naked expressions of emotion and consciousness. An absolutely revelatory album and highly recommended to those just getting into Nina's music.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Sometimes my first impression listening to a release of this magnitude turns out to be dead-on and then sometimes repeated play exposes weaknesses I was quick to overlook in my zeal to embrace new music by one of my favorite artists. For that reason, many times I have to listen to an album (especially those with more progressive leanings) for a few weeks (or even months sometimes) in order to really appreciate the greatness. I confess that my initial impression a few weeks back was like so many others, Wow, this is the Queensryche weve been missing. But then a bit of skepticism began to creep in with repeated listens and I noticed the music seemed to lack some of the passion and motivation Id been hearing initially. It was definitely much better than the self-titled reboot but it wasn't moving me as much as it had on initial listens and I began to wonder if I would be reaching for this music 6 months down the road. After putting it away for a week and listening to some other new and old material and then coming back with a fresh perspective Im ready to nail down my impressions  all of which are thankfully circling back to that all important initial impression.\n\nThe Warning\/Rage For Order (both perfect) are my two favorite Queensryche releases but I love OM, Empire and even Promised Land (in descending order). My expectation for this new incarnation of Qryche was that I honestly never wanted to hear another Operation Mindcrime nor did I expect a return to those early career moments of brilliance. 2013s release was a good restart, but it left me wanting something more. It relied a bit too heavily on old formulas and the mix left a lot to be desired in my opinion for a band of this caliber. Condition Human, on the other hand, turns out to be an extremely gratifying collection of songs which have enough of the older vibe to keep this definitely identifiable as Queensryche while simultaneously bringing in some new elements that keep this from becoming predictable  and after many listens now, far from boring or ordinary.\n\nTodd LaTorre is a force and its great to finally hear him let loose here. While I still think there is a bit too much Tate in his singing style going on with some of these songs (Toxic Remedy, Selfish Lives and The Aftermath for example) I am relieved to hear LaTorre diversify. I really cant help but go back to the situation in Kamelot where Karevik replaces Khan  Karevik clinging just a bit too much to the Khan sound on his first release with the band (Silverthorn) but on the second (Haven) he brought more of his own styles into the mix. LaTorre really shines on these opening tracks (especially Hellfire) with his more power metal style. Also, as a drummer, I really appreciate Rockenfield stepping up his game on this record. I thought he was solid on the 2013 release, but here he showcases his greatness. His gift is in the nuances and not always in the straight up power  the 3 note bass ruffs, the subtle shifting back and forth from closed to open hats, the cymbal splashes and the way he works the toms into the melody of the song. He does all this while maintaining an impeccable driving rhythm. Ive always loved his work on The Warning and his drumming here is nothing short of inspiring. The guitar riffs and melodies are fantastic and the solos (especially that soaring classic ryche shred in Selfish Lives) sing out with passion and conviction. And Jacksons crushing bass on the progressive Eye 9  the most impressive of the newer style tracks here  is a welcome groove that transitions the album into the more acoustic and melodic half.\n\nNo track by track analysis for me, its all good. I would have been just fine if they had left Hourglass out (it doesnt really fit stylistically hearkening back to the HITNF vibe) and its a bit too repetitive in the second half. Hellfire is probably my favorite song here, but love all of the first 7 tracks along with the title track. In the end, these are definitely songs I am going to be reaching for 6 months or longer down the road, and probably for years to come.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Five MARVELOUS Stars! This is a legendary recording that came from trumpet genius Clifford Brown's 1954 west coast tour with pre-eminent drummer Max Roach, and has an all-star reed and rhythm section consisting of Herb Geller on alto sax, Joe Maini on alto sax, Walter Benton on tenor sax, Curtis Counce on bass and Kenny Drew on piano. The photograph on the related&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Best-Coast-Jazz\/dp\/B000068W1W\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Best Coast Jazz<\/a>&nbsp;LP, which was recorded at the same time, shows the intense group of Clifford, Joe, Walter, and Herb in a semi-circle around one microphone with Max Roach's drums nearby, but the jam session sound is excellent with everything clearly audible. With Max Roach relentlessly driving the group along with 'drum major' figurations and variations, Duke Elllington's \"Caravan\" is a monster performance where EmArcy Records just let the tape run without edit and each song took up an entire side of a 33 1\/3 LP. My favorite parts are Roach's masterful 'boiler works' drumming, Herb Geller's fiery solo which has Roach yelling approval, as he does for Brown's, plus Maini and Barrow are also on their solo 'A game'. One can only imagine what a thrill it was for these west coast aces to play with Brown and Roach, and vice versa. The performances here and on the inventive, relaxed ballad \"Autumn In New York\" which also has some superb solos, especially Clifford and Herb and Joe, both live up to the expectations of a great jam session. It is said \"Best Coast Jazz\" was released prior to Clifford Brown's death at age 25 in a traffic accident and \"Clifford Brown All-Stars\" was a posthumous release. With Mr Brown's death, the Clifford Brown 'school' of jazz trumpet later came to fruition with the arrival of heavyweights like Freddie Hubbard and Lee Morgan. This recording is a \"must have\" in any comprehensive jazz collection, and now finally available in mp3 format, (and admittedly there are other combinations of these songs available) it is easy to download at a great price indeed.

{"text":"The Assassins Creed franchise has given us some wonderfully fun scores over the years. Jesper Kyd laid the fantastic groundwork for Lorne Balfe to follow and take into a different direction. Now Brian Tyler steps up to add his high-energy thematic scoring to the newest entry in the game series. Black Flag takes the game into the pirate realm of the Caribbean, so you know the music is gonna be fun as hell. Brian Tyler delivers everything youd want in a swashbuckling adventure set in paradise, which also makes for a rivetingly entertaining listen.\n\nIm sure you're wondering, does it sound like Pirates Of The Caribbean? No, not at all. Brian Tyler adds his own take on pirate lore by being completely aware of the big shadow Zimmer created over the subject material. The score is propulsive and filled with fantastic action tracks. The opening theme is just plain awesome. It carries the big melody extremely well while giving it a grand amount of energy. The rest of the tracks have some great moments. The High Seas is a wonderful swashbuckling action track and really embraces the subject matter of the game. The fiddle is a very prominant instrument throughout the score and gives it that time period feel. The music is very modern though and Tyler doesnt shy away from sharp percussion and electronics. Stylistically the score takes on a bit of a Spanish flavor later in the album as Tyler introduces some acoustic guitar. Since this is a large open-world game the music does echo the unstructured feel a bit. So as an album you may find the pacing and progression of a story a bit lacking, but again its the nature of the game.\n\nBlack Flag is a terrific and exciting score from Brian Tyler. Tylers themes have always been his big calling card, and thats still the case here. Black Flags main theme is indeed exciting and is a great anchor for the entire body of the score. He infuses great action, melodies and instrumentation to make this a truly energetic and fun pirate adventure. The music builds the world around you and keeps you immersed in it. If you're looking for a grand adventure-filled pirate score that successfully has its own identity then look no further.","classification":4,"fold":8}

In a world full of empty, media-hyped, insipid, half-naked popstars, Amy Winehouse rejuvinates the spirit.

{"text":"Don't let the ridiculously low price put you off this purchase. Sure, it's not the Vienna Philharmonic or the ASMF, but the Philharmonica Hungarica under Peter Maag in the later symphonies is no slouch, and the Mainzer Chamber Orchestra - which I have been told is comprised of music educators who aren't necessarily full-time orchestral players - does a fine job in the bulk of the works. Conductor Gunther Kehr is well known to classical music collectors through his many recordings made for the Vox label in the 1960s-70s, many of them previously released on CD in budget-line \"Vox Boxes.\"\n\nI suppose one could quibble about certain things - the chamber orchestra sounds fairly small, and the acoustic setting for the Maag recordings isn't consistent, but such reservations need to be set against the selling price of 99.\n\nIf you're hesitant, give a listen to a few of the sound clips from throughout the cycle.

The opening track \"Tompkins Square Park\" bounces with producer James Ford sitting in on drums on a farewell song, \"I want to hold you in the dark once last time.\"  \"Believe\" starts with a dreamy keyboard wash and a catchy melody, \"I had the strangest feeling, your world's not all it seems; So tired of misconceiving what else this could've been.\"  \"Just Smoke\" is the track currently coiling into my personal top ten with its driving beat, literate lyric and lovely melody, \"Take a minute, take a breath, lay down your head on my sunken chest; I saw a flicker and just smoke, but as you left I was calling your name at the night.\"  \"Ditmas\" is another strong track with a heartbreak lyric and guitars that thunder on the chorus, \"This is all I ever was; and this is all you came across those years ago; Now you've gone too far; Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth, and now I'm losing you.\"  \"Wilder Mind\" is a very strong CD, different from the band's previous discs, but showing growth while maintaining great quality.

{"text":"Purity Ring is a Canadian duo consisting of Corin Roddick on keyboards and Megan James on vocals. Three years ago, they came seemingly out of nowhere with their stellar debut album \"Shrines\", which immediately created a buzz in the indie music scene. After relentless touring and some much deserved time away, now finally comes the highly anticipated second album.\n\n\"another eternity\" (10 tracks; 35 min.) kicks off with an immensely appealing \"heartsigh\", and what strikes me right away is that the production seems a bit slicker than on the debut album. That is confirmed in subsequent tracks, such as the pleasant \"bodyache\". \"push pull\" (1st single) was released last Fall as a teaser\/preview for the new album, and one of the better songs on here. The other thing that comes across is that these songs are more mainstream than most of what we heard on the debut album. Check out \"repetition\", which is at heart a nice electronic \"pop-ballad\".  The album's Side 2 kicks off with \"begin again\" (2nd single), which is not bad but I would've picked the more urgent \"heartsigh\" as the new single. Megan sounds as lovely as ever, such as on \"flood on the floor\", another stand-out song. The album's closer is \"stillness in woe\", the most abstract-sounding track on here, and this is not a complaint.\n\nIn all, this is a solid second album from Purity Ring, even if it lacks the element of surprise from the debut album and overall feels like they are going for a slightly safer sound. But it's still MILES better and more interesting that a lot of the mainstream music out there, that's for sure. I hope to get a chance to see them in concert later this year, I imagine that live many of these songs will sound a lot harder and more danceable. Meanwhile, \"another eternity\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n*UPDATE* Purity Ring has been announced as one of the headliners for the MidPoint Music Festival here in Cincinnati come September. You can bet your last dollar that I will be upfront and center for that!","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Los Angeles Lucinda Williams has the kind of voice that will melt your soul.  On her 12th studio album since 1979, the words slide from her mouth with dusky-slurred heart-ripped emotion.  When she says, I know about the pain and all that jazz., you believe her; for at least that moment, you can feel it, too.  Theres a smooth country flow to the music that rings with authenticity and the subtly passionate guitars of Bill Frisell (Naked City, Floratone) & Greg Leisz (Forest Rangers).  The songs are warm, deep and natural, with a penetrative sense of forlorn resignation tempered by a dangling thread of hope.  Includes some words by Woody Guthrie and a Bruce Springsteen cover.  Sometimes reminds me of Rosanne Cash, Marianne Faithfull, Bonnie Raitt.  This is music for sad-eyed reflection and the slow head-shake of cathartic realization.  A Moment of respite that youll treasure.","classification":5,"fold":8}

When Kesha's first album came out I more latched on to just the catchy hooks, and was looking forward to more, not that it was anything special, just to add some variety to my barrage of hard and heavy music I needed balanced out. Katy Perry's Teenage Dream was welcoming, and musically sound, and after years of waiting, Kesha delivers Warrior. Amazing. The album was well worth the wait\n\nThe album kicks off with the title track and hooks you on with the chorus right from the get go. What continues is a nonstop catchy and infectious pop and dance cornucopia. It's difficult to sit still with the majority of tracks on the album, you have to get up and get moving. Thinking of You, Wonderland, and Love into the Light offer moments of reprieve and balance for the rest of the album. As for the rest of the album, prepare to move, especially to Dirty Love featuring Iggy Pop. It's already hard to resist any song featuring Iggy, and this one is impossible not to like.\n\nLyrically the album offers a little bit more depth than her previous works. While many of the themes remain the same (sex, drinking, partying), Warrior is also an encouragement for listeners to step and fight for their beliefs, and die young is about living life as if each moment was your last.\n\nAgain, great album. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre.","classification":5,"fold":8}
{"text":"While many argue that Nevermind is either overrated or underrated, I find it to be both.\nIt's overrated since I disagree with many calling it the greatest album of all-time or the greatest alt-rock album ever. It's not the greatest album ever or even the greatest alt-rock album. Albums like the Pixies' Doolittle, R.E.M.'s Murmur, The Clash's London Calling, and Pavement's Slanted And Enchanted are all better rock albums than Nevermind. Why VH1 called it the second greatest album of rock & roll is a mystery to me.\nHowever, Nevermind is underrated since many seem to ignore how talented and great Nirvana was. Yeah, they sold millions of records and broke into the mainstream, but they never sold out or changed their sound to become popular. I seriously doubt they wanted to become as big as they did. They did not \"rip-off\" the Pixies, Husker Du, or Sonic Youth. Rather, they took those influences and created a sound that was their own. There is not one weak track on Nevermind. \"Something In The Way,\" \"Come As You Are,\" \"In Bloom,\" \"Drain You,\" etc. are all great, brilliant songs. The only thing that might take away from the album is that fact that their singles (\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" \"Lithium,\" \"Come As You Are,\" and \"In Bloom\") were seriously overplayed on MTV and radio. But is that Nirvana's fault? Nope.\nNevermind is a very, very, very good album. It deserves a listen from rock fans everywhere. It is one of those albums where you won't skip any tracks. Nirvana had their own, unique sound and were very original and creative. The greatest album ever? Nope. An excellent and classic album? Yes.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I normally don't listen to a lot of modern music, but something about Gotye's hit \"Somebody That I Used To Know\" appealed to me in a strange way.  Perhaps it's the music, which seems to heavily feature xylophone (not necessarily an instrument used in most pop music) and lacks a lot of electronic sound.  Perhaps it's the hypnotic beat and mellow tempo, which while not slow isn't necessarily upbeat either.  Or perhaps it's simply the vocals, which give us a haunting ballad about a failed relationship that a LOT of people can probably relate to.\n\nAt any rate, this is an oddly compelling and addictive song, and well worth a listen.  It's quite a departure from most contemporary music, and in this case it's a fantastic thing to find something a little different from the norm.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Being the daughter of Katie McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright III and the sister of Rufus Wainwright, Martha had better posses some form of musical aptitude. On this belated debut, Martha delivers a strikingly autobiographical effort with sharp imagery and folk-based strumming. From gleaming songs like \"The Maker\" and \"TV Show\" to brash lyrics on the lead single \"Bloody Mother F***ing A**hole\" to the deep somber of \"Whither I Must Wander,\" the album is full of texture.\n\nOther victories include \"This Life\" and \"G.P.T.\" Although the album's resilience is that of a purely melodic and lyrical sense, Martha Wainwright is without palpable singles.  Nonetheless, this coffee shop favorite is not set to whither away, with both her parent's fan base and her brother's loyal followers to aid her.\n\nThe code, here, is not hard to crack, however, it takes time for Wainwright's vocal stretching and folkie approach to latch on, much like her bother's latest Want Two.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"The title track of Tunnel Of Love uses the classic amusement park ride as a way to examine his own marriage.  Just like the ride, marriage ought to be easy, ought to be simple enough, a man meets a woman and they fall in love.  But it's not that easy, there are bumps in the ride and sometimes it gets rough.  Mr. Springsteen's first marriage was failing at the time and the line it is easy for two people to lose each other is quite prophetic as the marriage ended up in divorce.  The music perfectly captures the carnival mood of the piece and Nils Lofgren's guitar solo cuts through the joyful sound like a razor blade acting as the tension that cuts through the rocky relationship. The song fades out with the recording of the sounds of a real roller coaster from Pt. Pleasant Beach, NJ.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Twelve amazing tracks, a rockin' collection of blazing blues with a ballad or two thrown in and plenty of mean licks. That's what I'm talkin' about !\n\nThis hometown (Kansas City) band has been soaked in the blues since their formation. The three siblings in Trampled Under Foot are Danielle Schnebelen, lead vocals and bass; guitarist and vocalist Nick Schnebelen, and singer\/drummer Kris Schnebelen, they are the children of blues musicians Bob & Lisa Schnebelen. The folks never made it big outside of their hometown of Kansas City, but their kids have been tearing up the scene since they started playing together in 2006.\n\nUp-tempo numbers such as, the gritty Get It Straight, the boogie tune Have A Real Good Time and the funky Just Tell Yourself prove that they put their hearts and souls into every number. \"Evil Train\" has a dark haunting vocal by Nick, a laid back\/throw back western kinda feel.\n\nOne cant help but conclude that this album was constructed for the express purpose of taking on and winning over a live audience, but that's not stopping me from enjoying it with the stereo cranked up loud. This one is a cool, down home, nasty CD that will have you beggin' for more. 5 stars easily !","classification":5,"fold":8}

This reviewer is of the second class because I study topics like human trafficking, genocide, and terrorism in my political science courses and every time I need an uplift from the depression that tends to set in sometimes in dealing with these subjects I reach for this song.

{"text":"Back in the day, or just a few years ago, the Foo crafted the best rock anthems out there on the pop\/rock side of the equation. And while it wasn't exactly revolutionary, it rocked like nothing else. \"Learn To Fly\" is probably the best of their rock anthems, which go great in any arena, stadium, or any venue with tons of people to rock along with.\n\nThe lyrics are truly a Grohl original, who knows how to craft a song like this like nobody else. The verses do their job, and produce some great lines, but everybody knows they're just the stuff in-between the chorus. And the chorus is in true rock anthem style, keeping the riffs soaring, the vocals soaring and the song flying high.\n\nOverall, very pleasant and rockin' Foo Fighter modern rock with arena anthem roots, it keeps itself together in places it could have gone wrong, and again, that chorus is just so awesome.

This band has a little bit of something for everyone.  I love this CD and it has backed my Fitz and the Tantrums cd into 2nd place for my \"drive ride\".  Buy It...It's Way worth the cost I paid...PS--The price of this cd download has gone up about $2.50 since I purchased it on Monday afternoon..likely due to the TV gigs...But, It's Worth IT!!\"","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"\"Something always brings me back to you, and never takes too long.\"\n\nFive EXCELLENT Stars! Singer\/songwriter Sara Bareilles is definitely one of the best young rising stars out there in pop music: possibly headed towards Streisand and Dion territory if she keeps it up, writing and singing some heavyweight, heartfelt songs, delivered by her sweet dynamic soprano voice, backed up by her own attractive piano stylings. In the album \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Little-Voice\/dp\/B00136Q6DA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Little Voice<\/a>\", one of the best performances among many is the song \"Gravity\" starting sweetly and building in intensity to one stunning, hair-raising grace note crescendo that is twisted and turned up and down the music scale in one long breath. \"Gravity\" was previously the lead song in \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Careful-Confessions\/dp\/B004HE43B2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Careful Confessions<\/a>\".

{"text":"Il Volos new CD is fablulous. There voices are better then they were, (how can that be possible?)  Maturity, great management and their own sheer drive to pursue their passion for their music,is working for them and we their fans and those who will be their fans are the lucky recipients of all this talent. Although I loved Ignazio's  romantic tenor tones from the very first, his voice has become fuller and richer, without losing those wonderfully romantic inflections in all the right places that make the listener feel like they are part of the scene the words are painting., Ignazio's ability to touch hearts with his voice is what I love most about his voice. Piero, that voice of pure energy and the electrical power that drives some of the best classical moments in Il Volos' songs of romance, is every bit as good as Placido Domingo, actually, in my humble opinion I prefer Piero's voice over Placido's, Piero's voice seems much more developed , and he gets it, he knows the perfect time to turn on that power and energy that sends some of Il Volo's songs light years ahead of anything else out there. Gianluca, his voice has been coated with even deeper silk like no other baritone singer I have heard in years. It flows over you with a smoothnes and richness so thick and unflawed like dark chocolate or fine wine.\nThe CD  We Are Love contains 12 tracks, and if you get the bonus CD you will get 17 tracks, 5 of which are Christmas songs.\n\nThe song:  I Bring You To My Senses----- (sung in English) is so romantic, the kind of romantic that is real.  The kind of song you sing to your forever love, even when you are old and gray.\n\nThe song: Il Canto --- with Placido Domingo is not only beautiful but it shows just how talented these young men\n  are, unbelivable to be so gifted at their age,all to their fans benifit,to enjoy them for\n  years to come.\nThe song: Cosi --- I felt like this beautiful song was a strong showing of the Pop mixture Il Volo wants to add to\n  their dimension, fits right in with the youthfulness that they are and does it with flare!\nThe song: We are Love ----(Sung in English) Wow, I will be learning these words and singing them to my soul mate, he will love it.\n\nThe music set to the words of all the songs adds appropriately to the purpose of each song, whether it is ultimate romance and devotion , the Pop ,lets dance , celebrate our youth and energy, our love of life... the music emotion and choice of languages they sing each song in only adds to the whole amazing package.  Il Volo is all three of these performers together, they would not be nearly as fabulous solo as they are together, each one has a dynamic that the other 2 do not have, when you put them all together you have pure perfection.  The other tracs on the CD are also full of their shared and individual talents to make the songs magic. On the bonus tracs, especailly on the Christmas songs recorded severeal years ago, I could hear how far they have come, it's kind of like hearing them grow up vocally and as a group.  Highly Recommended !!!!!","classification":5,"fold":8}

In retrospect I wouldn't expect it to, unless it was one of the live performances, eg Les MIz.\nThe vocals are fantastic, but for me, the context and the shock of what is physically happening to Elphaba is what took my breath away.\nSo take this for what it is, a studio recreation of a classic Broadway moment. But look to the Youtubes for some of the Widked performances or even concert footage of Idina Menzel performing \"Defying Gravity\" to bring back the emotion experience you remember from the show.","classification":4,"fold":8}

For Bruno Mars, he has had the challenge of trying to drive and stay relevant in his songs. Locked Out Of Heaven, the lead single from his sophmore album Unorthodoxed Jukebox, is definitely one of the better songs he has recorded, but also a better song for his career and than those cheaper songs from Gungham Style and other trends that have lost their power. Locked Out Of Heaven brings in a soul style, and a dash of vibe from what The Police had in their songs back in the 70's and 80's. Still, it is better than what I have recently heard, and I hope Bruno Mars can make more song that are good down the road.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"I got and fell in love with Josh Wilson's debut CD last year, so when he released his short follow up, I had to get it.  It is only seven tracks long, but it's also much cheaper than a full length CD, so it all evens out.  And the songs here are well worth getting.\n\nThe CD actually opens with the Christmas influenced \"Sing.\"  It was actually part of an MP3 release he did last Christmas.  But the song works well for the entire year.  The song is a praise song to the God who has saved us, but also a reminder of how much we needed Him to save us.  It's a nice mid tempo track that will get stuck in your head.  Trust me, you won't mind.\n\nThe title is pulled from the next song, \"Before the Morning.\"  It's a pop ballad written to someone dealing with the struggles in life, reminding them that God is still there and will bring them through this challenge.\n\n\"Listen\" and \"How to Fall\" are the upbeat tracks of the disc.  The first is a very honest admission that he needs to listen to God more.  The second is a very fun love song.\n\n\"Do You Want to Know\" is really the only track I don't love here, but I have a feeling that is because it convicts me.  The slower song is about the needs we overlook daily as we go about our lives.\n\n\"Right in Front of Me\" is another slow song as Josh pleads with God for some proof to help ground his faith.  It's a very honest song, and I identify with it more than I should.\n\nThe disc ends with a dueling guitar instrumental version of \"Amazing Grace.\"  It's very well done and great to listen to.\n\nI always love it when a new artist releases a great second disc, and that's the case here.  Josh's lyrics are still sharp and identifiable.  There is a hint of rock in his pop\/folk music that will continue to appeal to the fans he made with his first release.  And if you are looking for a great new artist to try, look no further.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"One of my mellow faves. As close and light as I dare get to brushing up against something like Elton John's 'Your Song' or Rita Coolidge's 'We're All Alone'. If You Could Read My Mind includes a folky air of mystic dreaminess and presents a romantic honesty without flying off into Sapland. The music is pretty subdued, nice acoustic guitars and the use of one of my favorite techniques, the gently rising, unobtrusive string arrangement. Then there's Gord's voice, so soft and comfortable, like a perfectly worn baseball mitt. I also like that the lyrics don't always rhyme in the places where you think they should. It's a Dear Jane letter, the writer trying to explain why he is no longer in love, and having a hard time understanding it himself. Lots of cool images - a ghost from a wishing well, a fortress strong, a paperback novel from the drugstore, an old-time movie.\n\nThere are many different photos of Gordon Lightfoot out there...I prefer the rugged curly haired mustachioed mid 70s AM radio adult contemporary Gord's Gold version.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Like Brian Eno and David Byrne's collaboration My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts from 1981, Malcolm McLaren and company borrow from several different cultures and mash them up into a beat-driven hip hop hybrid that is both familiar and unclassifiable. If anything Malcolm McLaren and company are a bit more adventurous in their cultural pillaging, taking music from South Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, and country, bluegrass and hip hop from the US. The difference being McLaren's effort is a bit more cheeky and far less concerned with art rock than with duck rock. Unfortunately long and annoying passages from some radio djs (The World's Famous Supreme Team?) are interspersed throughout the tracks and they are as intrusive as they are irritating. Maybe if they came in once or twice I could deal, but they're inserted quite a bit and the same sequences are repeated ad nauseum creating rather annoying breaks or interludes oft times in the middle of the longer tracks. Combine that with the very dated rapping and what you have is an interesting cultural artifact, Duck Rock has been credited as an early introduction of hip hop to England, but its not something I want to listen to often. Unlike Eno & Byrne's previous effort it hasn't dated well and is equally as interesting as it is annoying. I'm afraid the good is about equal to the bad.","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"This cd is a vast improvement over Forty Licks and is truly career spanning. This is the Greatest Hits cd we've all wanted for a long time now. But I've noticed in the reviews here that the songs are described as being in chronological order and this is simply not true. They are in relatively chronological groups but the order is not the order in which they were released. It would take up too much space to give examples, but very little of it is in truly chronological order. If you want to, look it up on Wikipedia or another music site. I'm not being a nit-picker here though it may seem so. Anybody who went wild for the Stones in 1964 and grew up with all these songs knows their real order and for many reasons would usually want to hear them that way. They (the label,not the group) came close this time but no cigar. The thing is the songs are on the right disc together; would it have been too much to arrange them correctly? And must there always be the \"one missing song\" on so many hits collections? Would it have been that impossible to include Mother's Little Helper ( and really, Lady Jane belongs here too). Was there no Summer of 1966? But at least they included the nearly lost and forgotten We Love You from the late summer of 1967. Oh well, at least it's the computer age and we can rearrange things. And despite my griping, it's The Stones in all their glory in one of the greatest careers in music history. Get it!","classification":5,"fold":8}

George's songwriting talent would bloom starting with  the next album, \"Rubber Soul\".  Elsewhere on the album--  depending on your taste, the countryish \"Act Naturally\" may not  be your cup of tea (it's almost a novelty recording) and the cover of  \"Dizzy Miss Lizzie\" is one of their most listless 'rave ups'  (despite it being the albums closer).  That said, the remaining tracks  contain some of the all-time gems in their body of recorded work--  particularly the title track, Paul's immortal \"Yesterday\", and  the pounding single \"Ticket to Ride\".  While not their most  consistent release, this was another step forward in the evolution of rock  music's greatest band.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas might just be the very best Christmas song there is. Holistically Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is the song that best captures the essence of what Christmas should be right down to the title. Christmas doesn't have to extravagant but it should be happy,nice,peaceful,comfortable,and enjoyable. If it weren't for Frank Sinatra we wouldn't have the lyrics to this song we know and love today. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas originated in 1944 in a time period where many meaningful Christmas songs such as White Christmas and I'll Be Home for Christmas were emerging. The original version had somewhat different lyrics. The most notable difference is that the original version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas had a line that was sung. \"In a year we all we will be together if the fates allow. Until then we'll just have to muddle through somehow.\" Sinatra called songwriter Hugh Martin and told him \"I like your Christmas song\" but that he needed that line \"jollied up\" to include the piece on his Christmas album. Sinatra said \"The name of my Album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly that line up for me?\" And,of course,as Martin put it \"You don't say no to Frank Sinatra.\" The new lyrics in this line became \"Through the years we all will be together if the fates allow. Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.\" Frank Sinatra then became the artist to perform Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas with the improved lyrics. Frank Sinatra's Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is THE original version of Have Yourself a Merry Christmas and gets 5 out 5 stars hands down. :)","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"A 70's hit, one of those melancholy sets which were not uncommon in that decade. \"Bread\" was a highly successful band which produced hit after hit, and their albums sold millions. Actual vinyl back then! \"Diary\" was written and produced by David Gates (Bread's keyboardist and vocalist), who was responsible for most of Bread's hits. Released in 1972, the song made it to #3 on Billboard's Easy Listening. It's a story, sung slowly and gently, from the singer's perspective. He discovers his wife's diary, reads it, and at first thinks the love expressed there is for him. As he examines things more closely, he discovers she's speaking of someone else, and his heart breaks. But his love for her is so great, he accepts this and, after an apparent unspoken divorce, he wishes for her and her new husband \"all the sweet things they can find.\" The 1970's saw several such wrenching songs, but this one is among the best, musically and through its expression of selfless love. If you came of age in the 70's, and ever had a crush on someone only to lose her to another, this song will speak volumes. Bread's music generally was melodic and what we now call \"soft rock,\" although that term didn't exist back then.\n\nGates and Bread's other vocalist (and guitarist) James Griffin started out as good friends, and were the foundation of Bread, but as time went on friction developed between them because Griffin, also a writer, thought Gates's work was given more exposure and resentments built. Bread disbanded in 1973, but reunited in 1976. It didn't last, and Griffin left the band. Bread continued here and there, with little subsequent success, and is now only a fond memory.","classification":5,"fold":8}

My friend tries her best in trying to get me to like him, but it's virtually impossible. She's \"made progress\" with that, however...but I'm going off on a tangent, so let me bring it back.\nI have mixed feelings about Chris Brown. Yes, he's a talented artist, but I'll never look at him the same again after he beat the crap out of Rihanna. With respect to this song, he added a nice element with the singing part in the beginning, but his speed rap obviously can't touch that of Busta Rhymes'. All this is done to a sick beat.

I think it just sucks because they're afraid to have diversity as far as sexuality goes in the mainstream rap world. That altogether shows how the rap scene tolerates difference.\n\nI mean if a black male is undercover, so what? Why does everyone feel like that's such a big deal? It's only human nature to have different types of people all over.\n\nBut anyway, decent song.

{"text":"Rob Zombie is honestly an artist that I would've normally ever bought.  I found the CD EDUCATED HORSES for a steal at a pawn shop and knowing that it was Zombie's most recent CD that had a handsome enough debut (#5 on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart), I thought I would pick it up and listen.  Boy I am glad that I did!  The album isn't say particularly innovative in anyway, but it is a solid album.  This album has several attributes that make it one of 2006's better albums among a mixed bag of releases that have graced the music industry this year.\n\nOne of the largest attributes is the heaviness of the guitar. While at times they may be the slightest bit overproduced, the overall timbre is nothing but desirable. The guitars sound sick here and very representative of metal. Another attribute is Zombie's vocals.  Zombie has a nice voice with a very interesting timbre to it that makes even less inspired material rock hard.  The instrumentation of EDUCATED HORSES is another plus;  besides whining guitars are gritty vocals, there is piano throughout a number of the tracks, making even the hardest rocking metal track have a plaintive side to it.\n\nOverall, there are no terrible tracks on this album in the least- for the most part they are at least average, if not better than average. Tracks that stood out in my mind included \"American Witch\", \"Foxy, Foxy\", \"17 Year Locust\", \"The Scorpion Sleeps\", \"Death Of It All\", and \"The Devil's Rejects\".  Perhaps the biggest blessing or detraction however you view it is the 38 minute length.  For the price of a new copy, 38 minutes may seem robbery, but where the \"tightness\" of the album is concerned, 38 minutes is a blessing because there truly is no filler material, just a few tracks that don't stack up against the hits which is certainly a better formula than \"filler\" tracks.\n\nOverall, It is ashamed that despite a nice debut on the Billboard 200 that this album isn't selling better than it is.  It is worth a listen.  Certainly it isn't say 2006's album of the year because there are better albums, but it is certainly one of the year's better albums if nothing else. 4 stars.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"You can't go wrong with the variety and musicianship on display in this generous sampling of great hits, rarities, and covers from Tom and the band. The bargain-priced 4-CD set contains concert recordings made between the late 1970s and late 2000s, all of which have been expertly remastered. If you thrilled to the 2007 Scorsese documentary, which included truncated versions of many live tunes, then snap up this collection. Experience the glorious, full-throttle sound of what for my money is the hardest working band in show business. Petty is a brilliant songwriter, guitarist, and leader, and he won't back down, which is why the Heartbreakers are still together and still rocking as hard as they ever have after so many years.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"From the first time I heard this single on the Season Finale of Empire I knew it was going to be one of my favorite singles of the soundtrack.\n\nHow can you go wrong with Jennifer Hudson and Juicy J? The message is one that I think so many can relate to, and it couldn't be more timely.\n\n\"Hey there little mama show them how you're different,\" Jennifer sings. \"Go 'head, keep them talking. Give them ammunition.\" We will always have individuals who will try to change us, but we have to get to a place in our lives that we realize that mortal man can not judge us. Only One can do that.\n\n\"Ain't nobody's business how you turn it up,\" Jennifer reminds us.\"Ain't nobody's business who you wanna love..\" This song is not about saying you are right, but it is about realizing you can't live your life according to what other people may think about you.

{"text":"When I first heard this song on the radio, I was like, 'Wow, that's a change of pace.' And it was, after the usual modern rock chart-toppers they marched out one-by-one, this song is a refreshing change until... Radio drags it through the mud that is their airwaves 10 times a day. It was after a little while of that that I got more of a critical eye with the song as I came up with reasons to hate the song that was so overplayed by radio jocks. So first off, while the verses are good, the chorus, especially the last couple rounds of it in the last minute or so in the song, turns away from that, and falls flat, making it a flat love song at the end.\n\nSo overall, great verses, bad chorus. Maybe not the best of songs to win your lovers hand. But in any case, it's a good shake-up from the usual Nickelback.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"The Ugly Heroes trio of Mello Music Group (Red Pill, Apollo Brown and Verbal Kent) have been the next big thing in hip-hop for the past three years, ever since they released their amazing, self-titled debut LP in 2013. They're easily considered one of Mello's best groups to date and outside of the label, they are making phenomenal strides, combining Apollo Brown's beautiful soul with RP and VK's smart, philosophical, mature, wise and professionally advanced lyrics. Each man has a story. Red Pill from Detroit, the burgeoning enlightened Millennial backpacker is growing healthily within the creative ecology of MMG, Apollo Brown (also from Detroit) is a very accomplished producer with a uniquely identifiable style and a long list of credits, and Verbal Kent of Rogers Park, Chicago also has a lengthy discography and highly trained rap-chops. To the joy of everyone, they release today (June 24) their second album, Everything in Between, still on Mello Music and still on a heroically message-hearty binge. It makes for two back-to-back stellar engagements starting with the Ugly Heroes LP, and who knows? Maybe they'll someday make it a trifecta.\n\nEverything in Between gives us a lot of what we all need more of, beautiful universal truth. Let's start at the top. In \"Today Right Now,\" the refreshing lyrical duo of Red and Kent bring forth eye-opening revelations with the ultimate message being to not take life for granted, and they proceed with more fresh wisdom (\"Daisies\"), the advocation of good strong character (\"Peace of Mind\") and their own experiences with diversity, tolerance and community (\"Place Called Home\"). The most time-marked, most newsworthy song of the first half, \"This World\" lets Kent and Red Pill set things straight and rap sense about maladies across the globe - racism, Trump, brutal police, etcetera, and everything is presented in a very calm, serene and unobjectionable way, especially thanks to Apollo Brown. His gorgeous soul and easygoing jazz productions are to die for, commonly agreeable listening for all.\n\nDown the line, the subject of \"Can't Win For Losin'\" is falling on hard times, and then Red Pill, who is the biggest star of \"Roles,\" raps about being reluctant of bringing innocent children into a hateful world there. \"Heart Attack\" makes sure dreams, goals and high aspirations do not drop dead, and \"Unforgiven\" lays out two great rap stories. Red Pill confronts a detached resentful grandfather and Verbal Kent says accurately that a criminal set free by the justice system will forever be in mental prison. Lastly, they show their fangs in \"Fair Weather\" to help balance out any softness heard in the lead up sections. This timeless triumvirate are nothing short of magnificent in this perfect Everything in Between album. These Ugly Heroes could literally bring anyone onto their cause because one: they speak the truth and very eloquently at that, and two: they are backed by beat-prodigy Apollo Brown and his soothing jazz, blues and rock in a dynamic mixture. Furthermore, he reaffirms and strengthens his own style. Three heads are better than one here. Each man makes the other two tremendous people by giving them support and approval, and overall, they simply have an exceedingly splendid project on their hands and now it's in their fan's hands.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"The first three DM albums are okay, but most of the time from here on, works put in perspective the band's actual potential. The debut was fun and catchy even if silly, \"Broken Frame\" was kind of unfocused but had a couple of highlights, and \"Construction Time\"'s singles were classics but otherwise was mostly undistinguishable.\n\n23 years later, people can probably still identify with \"Some Great Reward.\" Why is this? Not only is this a classic example of a well-done industrial-pop Mode album, the lyrics are simple and are easy to relate to. In fact, the amazing middle of the record has its trilogy of relationship songs in \"It Doesn't Matter,\" \"Stories of Old,\" and \"Somebody.\" 2 of the 3 selections are sung by Martin. \"IDM\" is an awesome dreamy song, in a way unlike anything I've even heard from this band since. It's about appreciating the time they have, even if they know it may not last forever. And there's a cynical view on commitment and compromise in relationships on \"Stories of Old,\" possibly my favorite from the record. \"Somebody\" is one of the more famous tracks from the album, and is well-executed, along with some kind of interesting samples in the mix. It is a beautiful soul-searching track.\n\nThat doesn't mean the other 6 songs aren't any good; they are. And perhaps more than that. The weakest cut, by default, is \"Lie to Me,\" and I enjoy that one, as that even has lyrics someone can relate to. Experiences have a lasting impression, and I'm sure we've been around those. The album has an awesome opener with \"Something to Do,\" one of the most stadium-ready songs of DM's early career. The record also has the band's breakthrough hit \"People Are People.\" The band may not like it and the lyrics may be trite, but what's amazing is that several bands today are still covering the song. The clinging pipes on the song totally grab the listener's attention. It was a hit that was meant to happen.\n\nThen there's the awesome Wilder composition \"If You Want.\" The track is electronic and somewhat space-y. The lyrics are simple yet catchy and it makes a nice addition to the album, in between the somewhat shocking (at the time, at least) \"Master and Servant\" and \"Blasphemous Rumors.\" \"Master\" starts with a trade-off a cappella with Martin and Dave saying \"it's a lot,\" ending it with \"like life.\" It's a dark song for sure, the first time masochism would be themed in DM songs, and Martin would go to write several more tracks of the theme. Then there's teenage angst and irony in \"Blasphemous Rumors,\" which has kind of interesting samples and electronics. I don't really think it's intended as an anti-religious song so much as it is a track of tragedy, like how everything that can go wrong with someone ends up going wrong. Still, an enjoyable track.\n\nThere are no negative reviews for this record and the people who do in the future are probably just trying anyway. This began DM's cult success of the mid-'80's, and rightfully so. Totatlly worth the cheap price, or if you want the re-mastered sound, you could go for the CD\/DVD version.","classification":5,"fold":8}

Though hits and international fame would come later, the eight tracks released in 1981-2 remain the groups purest statement of their 60s-tinged harmony rock. They never wrote, played or sang with more elan, and the youthful effervescence of this early work is as compelling today as it was thirty-five years ago. The group first appeared on vinyl as The Bangs with the fan club single Getting Out of Hand b\/w Call On Me.

Now on CD, the EP can be heard without compression.\n\nFilling out this disc are four full-fidelity demos, a pair of 1984 live tracks, and a commercial for No Magazine. The demos include early takes of Call On Me and The Real World, a harmony-rich cover of the Turtles Outside Chance and a tough take on Paul Revere and the Raiders Steppin Out. The live cuts are Tell Me (from All Over the Place), and a cover of Loves 7 & 7 Is. The disc closes with 1982s The Rock & Roll Alternative Program Theme Song, a tune the group recorded for George Gimarcs pioneering radio show.  The only thing missing is the promo-only 12 remix of The Real World, but thats a nit. This is the holy grail for Bangles fans, especially those who never completely cottoned to the commercial polish of their Columbia years. [2016 Hyperbolium]","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"As Rosanne Cash related in her recent memoir, 'Composed', her life has been filled with many highs and lows, and Rosanne is a glass half-full kind of girl.  From the first track of 'Can I Still Believe In You' to the last track 'Sweet Memories', Rosanne brings us her history. Rosanne comes from a family rich in music from the old folk tunes, cultural and regional tunes, jazz, pop, rock and blues and country. Rosanne Cash is not a one note woman, her lucious voice crosses many genres. Her father, Johnny Cash, gave her a list of songs that she cherishes. It is filled with the tunes that describe our Americana. Rosanne has given us a cross section of some of those tunes, and the songs that she has sung in her albums over the past thirty plus years. Her life is interwoven through out these songs.\n\nRosanne sings with her father, Johnny Cash, Bobby Bare, Vince Gill, Rodney Crowell, Bruce Springsteen and Chris Thile. Many of my favorites are on this 36 song, two disc marvel. In this 'Essential' CD Rosanne brings us from her early beginnings, 'It Hasn't Happened Yet', to the sad times with one of the most emotional songs, 'September When It Comes' with Johnny Cash, to her record seller, 'Seven Year Ache'. It is difficult to pick a favorite, but 'Sea of Heartbreak' sung with Bruce Springsteen is it for me. You will find many songs that speak to you in this set, and we will all find our favorite voice.\n\nRosanne Cash brings us her life on a platter of 36 songs. All of them real and all of them a part of her life that brings us the whole truth. This is a comprehensive history of the singing life of Rosanne Cash. As she says in her song 'The Real Me',\n\n\"Well, I've got no answers now\n And I don't expect them from you\n Thank God for second chances, baby\n 'Coz there's something I can give to you\n\nAnd that's the real me, breakin' down at last\n Hey, it's the real me, crawlin' out of my past\n Baby, the real me, wants the real you, so bad\"\n\nHappy Birthday, Rosanne Cash!\n\nHighly Recommended.  prisrob 05-24-11\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-List\/dp\/B0029LHW5E\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The List<\/a>\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Very-Best-of\/dp\/B000BKDNXA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Very Best of<\/a>","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I have listened to almost all of the tracks now, and am pleased with my purchase. There is some variation in clarity of the recordings, but they are all at least adequate, and some are excellent. For example, I was disappointed in the clarity of Dvorak's concerto (tracks 3-5), but pleased with Victor Yoran's renditions of the Bach cello suites (tracks 6-11, 75-80 and 89-94). I assume that a few of the analogue original recordings are just a bit \"mushy\" and there isn't anything better which can be done with them, or better options available to this publisher at this price point. But even putting those few aside, there are enough very good recordings to justify paying almost a penny per track.\n\nI also have both&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-99-Most-Essential-Cello-Masterpieces\/dp\/B004QNMI6G\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The 99 Most Essential Cello Masterpieces<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Greatest-Cello-Concertos\/dp\/B003EY66CK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Greatest Cello Concertos<\/a>&nbsp;and there are some overlaps. But again, there are enough unique recordings to make the purchase worthwhile. Victor Yoran's Bach suites alone are easily worth the price.

{"text":"There is honestly a difference between a singer who makes people listen from the heart, and a singer that is more like a manufactured product than a real singer. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles happens to be more of a product than a real singer. Sadly, the feeling of her songs have been severely overplayed, to where it has made people stop enjoying her music. Her work is not really enjoyable anymore, that all the stunts she has had at pulling a surprise album up her sleeve to the populace, to where it is not even enjoyable anymore. Also, her work has been so overplayed that anything that she and Jay-Z has recorded for the past several years, to where it is more of a joke than a real singer. Her collaboration with Jay-Z, Drunk In Love does not even ignite from the heart. Honestly, the song is so severely overplayed to where my ear started to bleed in public. I really found this song to be more of a problem than anything that strikes from the heart. Also, the chemistry she and her husband has shown in the song is so poor that I don't even know if they should work together. They had better songs like Crazy In Love, but this song is really the pits. If you are new to Beyonce', I would say pass this song up.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":8}

But sadly, that had hurt her on her Can't Be Tamed album. For her latest in music, it hasn't actually shown she had delivered. We Can't Stop is fair as a party song, but really anything exciting in her voice, and from her heart. Her latest song, Wrecking Ball, the latest from her upcoming planned album Bangerz is not actually a driven and striking ballad from her, as was the case when she did The Climb.

Between 1962 and 2006 the group amassed a staggering total of 78 hits on the Billboard R&B charts while placing more than four dozen songs on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart.  Quite an accomplishment!  In early 1966 The Isley Brothers made the move to Motown.  In February they released the single This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak For You).  It would prove to be one of their biggest and most popular records of all-time.  It would be their only major hit during their two years at Motown.

{"text":"Although I am not traditionally a fanatic of rock music, I love quite a few of Lenny Kravitz's songs, \"It Ain't over `Til It's Over\" being my favorite.  I have seen many of his videos and seen him perform on award shows a few times.  I like his style.  He never conformed; he always exudes uniqueness and it just shines through. His 2008 release, \"It Is Time For A Love Revolution\" is a decent offering.  His best musical companion (the guitar) comes along for the ride; it's included in almost every song.  Vocally, he is just as good as he was on previous releases, \"Mama Said\" and \"5\".  His lyrics are decent on this album, but they don't contend with his best.  This album contains mostly mid-tempo and up-beat numbers.\n\n \"Bring It On\", \"I Love the Rain\" and \"Dancin' `Til Dawn\" all have decent guitar and percussion arrangements, along with great vocal delivery and alright lyrics.  \"Good Morning\" and \"Back in Vietnam\" are also worth listening to.  \"Good Morning\" has a pretty impressive melody and instrumental arrangement.  Kravitz's harmony is nice, too.  Out of all the songs on this album, I was most impressed by \"This Moment Is All There Is\" and \"Will You Marry Me?\"  Love\/marriage songs are usually ballads or slower songs, but Kravitz, like he always does, tries something different and gives his listener an upbeat love song.  I enjoyed it!  \"This Moment Is All There Is\" is the only ballad on the album, but it stands out because of that fact, and because it is lyrically very nice.  This is also the only song that doesn't include guitar and it's a nice change.\n\n Potential buyers, this is an average album. If you decide to pick it up, you'll most likely benefit in some way.  However, if you decide against it, your music collection won't miss it that much. 3 stars.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"Will You Marry Me?\"\n2. \"This Moment Is All There Is\"\n3. \"If You Want It\"\n4. \"A New Door\"\n5. \"Love, Love, Love\"","classification":3,"fold":8}

As a musical construction, \"Faith\" has similarities to \"The Wayfarer\" & is another gem.  \"Dine's Waltz\" is a lovely piano melody with synthesizer textures for context.  The CD's opening track \"Clyde & the Pearl\" brings the listener in with the cymbals percussion and the lovely keyboard themes.

This song really brings out the best of Clarkson, and to my knowledge, it's not a breakup song, so there's no anger, just plain Kelly and her vocals. The song is well-crafted, the lyrics are good, and the vocals shine.\n\nI'll always remember the song by a little moment I had with the song a few years back. Riding through Orlando, Florida at 4 o' clock in the morning, moving to my new house in NC, I was flipping through the radio and came to this song. And there I listened to it, in the back seat of a car, the lights of Orlando outside, and I just stared out my window. That's the atmosphere this song creates. And the song is a classic, and Clarkson's best in its own right.","classification":5,"fold":8}

This time it's Les Claypool works with Sean on various tracks composed by both, each respecting the other's position, pulling off, if not a magnum opus, but a find collection of inticate stories that lead you from here to there and back again.  The Cricket montage is an art, while Mr. Wright pokes as much fun as a Monty Python sketch.  Statements of ironic perversion spill forth, but not accusing of anyone in particular, only that those who find themselves in that camp are to be ridiculed.

{"text":"At the tender age of 12, Jackie Evancho continues to grow into a ravishing soprano voice that surpasses description and simply must be heard to be appreciated. First-time listeners gasp at the purity and maturity of her tone, but when they get over their astonishment, they cannot fail to hear the deep understanding she brings to her interpretation of melodies and lyrics.\n\nThe romance and beauty of film music is the theme of Jackie's fourth studio release. She helped to select the dozen tracks, so of course she sings a few dreamy songs from children's films like \"Tangled\" (a sweet duet with her brother Jacob), \"Mulan,\" \"The Lion King,\" and \"Willie Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.\" \"Pure Imagination\" from \"Willie Wonka\" opens the album (you can watch a preview at the PBS website), and it's an ideal introduction to the breathless wonder that this supremely gifted girl brings to everything she does.\n\nThe program presents dreamy versions of the love themes from \"South Pacific\" (making it a very Enchanted Evening), \"Titanic\" (with violinist Joshua Bell), \"Moulin Rouge\" (with the Canadian Tenors), and the film that inspired Jackie to begin performing, \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (\"Music of the Night\"). An immaculate rendition of \"When I Fall in Love\" closes the album. It was sung by Celine Dion for \"Sleepless in Seattle,\" but Doris Day originally sang it for \"One Minute to Zero,\" a little-known Robert Mitchum vehicle set during the Korean War.\n\nThere are surprises along the way: a powerful reading of \"The Summer Knows\" from \"Summer of 42\" with jazz trumpeter Chris Botti, one of my favorite cuts on the album, as well as \"Se\" from \"Cinema Paradiso,\" a duet with cellists Luka Sulic and Stjepan Hauser that is sung in Italian. \"What a Wonderful World,\" the touching Louis Armstrong chestnut, isn't exactly a movie tune, but it was featured in \"Good Morning, Vietnam,\" so it gets a pass. And Jackie makes it her own.\n\nThis summer, Jackie filmed her second Great Performances special, \"Music of the Movies,\" at the dramatic Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. It premiered in August on PBS, and it's currently available only in an exclusive CD\/DVD package from Target stores for just a few dollars more than the single CD. The songs on DVD are performed with full orchestra and special guests (the brilliant Jumaane Smith substitutes for Chris Botti on \"The Summer Knows\"), and they include all of the numbers on CD, albeit in a different order:\n\nPure Imagination (Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory)\nCan You Feel The Love Tonight (The Lion King)\nSome Enchanted Evening (South Pacific)\nWhat a Wonderful World (Good Morning, Vietnam)\nMy Heart Will Go On (Titanic)\nThe Summer Knows (Summer of 42)\nI See The Light (Tangled)\nSe (Cinema Paradiso)\nThe Music Of The Night (The Phantom of the Opera)\nWhen I Fall In Love (Sleepless in Seattle)\nCome What May (Moulin Rouge)\nReflection (Mulan)\n\nIf you enjoy Jackie's music, you really should buy both discs to comprehend her presence. Much of the magic she makes lies in her appearance and personality. You need to see and marvel at the instantaneous transformation of a giggling child with a lovely dress and an infectious smile into a poised artist with a magnificent instrument under perfect control. Jackie will capture your heart.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Say what you want about Jon B., but he has never made the same album twice. When he released his sophomore album \"Cool Relax\" in 1997, it was in complete contrast to his ballad-heavy debut \"Bonafide\". He kept things going with the long-winded but underrated third album \"Pleasures U Like\". Later on in his career, he issued his most uptempo- and arguably best- recording to date \"Stronger Everyday\". A few years later, he brought on \"Helpless Romantic\"- a recording that showed him being excited about married life and parenthood. On his first album in four years, Jon B. decides to switch things up again- releasing \"Comfortable Swagg\", a record that shows him experimenting with new sounds and ideas. The end result is an album that makes nods to the ambient sounds of today, such as Drake and Ryan Leslie.\n\nAll of the songs were written and produced solely by Jon B. on this new effort. He makes a few songs that flirt with Eurodance and house music- more specifically, the first three songs. He romances on the title track \"Comfortable Swagg\", gets celebratory on \"Goin' Down\" as well as \"Watch'n Now\". On \"Fill Your Cup\", he reunites with DJ Quik after having appeared on his 2011 album \"The Book Of David\". He reconciles with his spouse on \"Make Up Love\" and gets sensual on the atmospheric ballad \"Only One\". While he has made it a point to sound different on here, the song \"Do U Miss Me\" sounds like the Jon B. that everyone knows and loves. Despite the album getting off to a rocky start initially, \"Comfortable Swagg\" shows that Jon B. has no problems with stepping outside of his comfort zone. The only problem with this album is there are a few songs that were left off it that would have made welcome additions to this project. That said, Jon B.'s album is actually worth checking out.","classification":4,"fold":8}

It also has the rare honor of becoming a hit single by public demand, not being released until September of '62, while the show had been on the air since September of '60. People simply wanted it.\n\nIt's a remarkable piece, flinging you right into the scene, the bass being the rhythmic feeling of the road itself, the piano the breeze in your hair, the strings your soaring emotions as you cruise down the fabled highway. The middle section suggests night , as the music gets jazzier with a muted trumpet  that echoes Bobby Troup's song immortalized by the Nat King Cole Trio in the version on his After Midnight LP, perhaps pulling over to a local jazz club and all that could happen there at night on Route 66. Then the main theme picks up and you're on your way again.\n\nAnother aspect of the Theme is it's timing, being popular in the late Fifties and early Sixties, a time of great prosperity and optimism in the country. The Theme is full of confidence and brassy crescendos that seem, at least in retrospect, to sum up the feeling of a country that for a glorious moment felt it was doing everything right and on top of the world.\n\nOne of the great road songs ever.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Jackie first recorded Think of Me informally as an 8-year old who showed unlimited potential, and she finished by thanking all of us for watching. Jackie recorded the same song again just days after her 9th birthday at a high school reunion for a group of seniors, a jaw-dropping performance. Now, as a 14-year old, she performs the same song, a stunning recording like no other previous cover. The last 12 seconds of Jackie's voice offer a delightful surprise, when her tremendous crescendo and closure outlasts all accompanying instruments, including a single breath that cascades about 9 different exquisite notes - truly fantastic and uniquely beautiful. After listening, don't Think of Me; instead, Think of Jackie as earth's most talented vocal artist, at least since the beginning of recorded music, if not all time.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I will admit to sharing fellow-reviewer Stanley Crowe's reservations about Grigolo's ability to project in a large house but having heard him last week as Nemorino at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, I was able to hear him beautifully from up in the gods and am now a convert. I commented sceptically on the enthusiastic welcome given this disc by another fellow reviewer , the Santa Fe Listener, but am again ready to recant and say that five years later I am convinced that Grigolo is managing his vocal and career development very wisely. Perhaps the continued dearth of really Italianate tenors has made me more susceptible to his gifts but I am now genuinely enthused about his ability to carry the torch.\n\nThe best things about his voice apart from its intrinsic beauty are his evenness of production, the way in which he inflects the music with musically acute details and the clarity of his diction. He has studied and acquired all the little vocal refinements which allow a singer to inject the note with emotion without being too overt about it; hence he has mastered the judicious use of portamento,  the acciaccatura, the messa di voce and the despatch of fioratura - all of which may be heard to perfection in the best track here from the same role in which I have just heard him live, \"Una furtiva lagrima\".\n\nI was surprised that he opes this recital with an aria from a heavier, spinto tenor role but he manages it without strain and even returns to a second aria from \"Un ballo in maschera\"sings in track11. He does not here yet have quite the full weight of voice to do it full justice but his attention to colouring the text is exemplary. The programme includes several weightier arias alongside some standard bel canto numbers;hence early and middle period Verdi features, as does some heftier Puccini, as an indication of the direction he has gradually been taking since. In fact, there are only two Donizetti arias here;the rest are all from those two other composers.\n\nWhile his voice does not have the distinctive ping of the young Pavarotti, he sounds far more pharyngeal and virile than Bocelli - and I like his chutzpah in throwing in a high C sharp at the end of the aria from \"Il corsaro\". I look forward to bigger and better - but all in good time as he is still three years off forty as I write.\n\n(PS: the three supporting comprimario voices who make brief appearances in two tracks are absolutely dire - why?)","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"The Up Side: Nickelback are one of the very few bands who can balance loud, rock driven guitars with sweet pop-like melodies, and actually pull it off. When you're not rocking out, you'll be singing along at the top of your lungs. The Long Road is no exception to Nickelback's award winning, medium heavy sound. Song for song, TLR is without a single weak link, making for a complete and rewarding listen. Singles like Someday and Figured You Out are obvious smash hits, but when a band can create an entire 40+ minutes of quality material, equal or greater than said singles, you know they've got talent! The Long Road really is quality radio-rock for all moods, and the hooks are out of this world!!\n\nThe Down Side: Jealous critics\/musicians, usually those without much talent, are quick to judge such a tight sound, and that is exactly what happened with Nickelback and The Long Road. Bad press for such a good record boggles my mind, because although The Long Road isn't exactly a favorite with various web zines and online music reviewers, it truly is a timeless rock and roll album.\n\nThe Flip Side: Nickelback have a sound and style that work for them, and they aren't ready to give that up just yet. So while everyone else is making drastic changes to their sound just to keep up with trends, Nickelback keep it real.\n\nThe Conclusion: The Long Road will have you singing along for years to come, and if you liked Silver Side Up, chances are you'll like this one even more.\n\nThe End.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"\"Voyage\" is the third release from Japanese musician\/ painter\/ sculptor\/ architect Takashi Suzuki following his critically acclaimed and award nominated \"Cycle\" CD, and his debut album, \"Resonance,\" which was named \"Best Ambient Album\" in the 2012 ZMR Awards. His music has been well received and he has developed a compositional style that bears resemblance to his minimalist painting style. \"Voyage\" exudes a Zen-like serene spaciousness. From the monochromatic cover art to the sparse uncluttered graphics, everything about this release is ultimately ambient. On the inside, a poem that pays tribute to the spirit of his home city of Hiroshima. The album references the tragic event that happened there in 1945 from the imaginary perspective of someone who died in the bombing and is making a transition through the unknown spiritual world and the realizations that come at the end.\n\nThe expansive soundscapes drift from track to track maintaining a homogeneous vibe through out. There is a sense of continuity that flows from one song to the next carried by Takashi's signature style that is more about texture than melody. What I wrote about his \"Cycle\" CD is equally true for \"Voyage:\" \"Following in the comparison to Zen, the music is more about `being' than `doing.' Synthesizers provide the medium he creates his `ambient tone poems' with. The waves and washes of sound can best be described as floating, dreamy, and atmospheric and lend themselves to meditative states and quiet reflection.\" Comparisons have been made to Takashi's music and that of Brian Eno's early ambient albums, Steve Roach's \"Structures from Silence,\" and particularly the \"Liquid Mind \"series. I feel that there has been an evolution in Takashi Suzuki's music with each successive album he has released.  For me, \"Voyage\" is his best work so far. Given the critical and popular success his music has enjoyed, I'm sure that this album will appeal to his listeners as much or more.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Solti recorded this Beethoven cycle from Chicago between 1972 and 1975. The first thing to say in its favor is that the sonics are up to Decca's analog standards, with lots of detail, dynamic range, and punch. That suits Solti's style in Beethoven, because although he reins in his trademark fierce attacks and driving tempos, he's still aggressive. It's not so much that he sides with Toscanini against Furtwangler, but that he performs Beethoven from the outside, marshalling all the externals while revealing almost nothing of his own feelings for the music. Millions of CD buyers clearly like his style, and since I hadn't heard all his Beethoven symphonies, I thought I'd survey them.\n\nCD1 contains the 5th and 2nd symphonies, which sound much the same under Solti's direction. He pulls Beethoven forcefully out of the classical world of Haydn, an effect amplified by using a full modern orchestra. The lovely slow movement of the Second is bulked up beyond what we hear nowadays, and the Scherzo proceeds with startling sfozando accent that stab at the rhythm. The finale is fast and efficient. Strangely, the Fifth could use more of this propulsion. After a biting attck at the famous motto, the strings become almost mechanical. Solti needs to supply vitality form the inside, but he doesn't. As a result, all the movements sound proficient and impersonal. The CSO brass dominate the finale, as you'd expect, but Solti's tempo lags a bit behind Beethoven's Allegro con brio.\n\nCD 2 is devoted to the Eroica and two overtures, Egmont and Coriolan. The opening movement of the symphony is surprisingly old-fashioned and measured, but accents are strong. In its broad, forthright way it's convincing, despite moments when vitality lapses. The funeral march is serious, dignified  and well-paced. If only Solti could find it in himself to be moved, because without that, we won't be. The Scherzo is exemplary and the horn trio a thrill (it's taken at tempo but not fast). The impression of a traditional Eroica is underscored in the finale, which is more respectful than abandoned. The two overtures are in the same vein, their chief virtue being the orchestra and the recorded sound. Still, this is one of the more successful CDs in the set.\n\nCD 3  brings a fairly familiar pairing, the Pastorale and 8th symphonies.  Solti would seem to be ill-suited to the gentler, bucolic side of Beethoven, but he is never less than skillful and respectful. The Pastorale finds him in a relaxed mood--I'm not sure I'd call it genial--and frankly the results are more successful than Karajan's over-poolished, emotionally frigid accounts.  The Chicago strings remain sweet and almost Viennese throughout. After a proficient Scherzo in the style of Szell (no actual peasants allowed) and with excellent wind solos, the storm proceeds without undue shocks. In other words, it doesn't inspire Solti to brutality. The finale needs more joy and reverence, but it is robust and direct. In all, one of Solti's best efforts in Beethoven.\n\nThe 8th opens with a too-heavy Allegro vivace, but Solti is in good humor and doesn't drag things down. To me, this symphony requires the kind of wit, delicacy, and effervescence as Mendelssohn, and since Solti only gives us a traditional Germanic account, with sharper than usual accents, I am not ovelry enthusiastic. But as a filler to the Sixth this is more than adequate, and one can always fall back upon the gorgeous playing.\n\nCD 4 gathers the 7th and 1st Symphonies, an odd pairing. The 7th requires an exceptional reading to efface memories of Kleiber and Karajan, specialists in this work. Solti isn't inspired, but the CSO plays with blazing commitment, which counts for a lot (they were just as good for Reiner in his classic account on RCA Living Stereo).  LIsteners who want to hear lots of horns in the mix will be more than satisfied. Solti's rhythm could be crisper in the first movement; the Allegretto is taken a bit faster than the norm in German readings but isn't light-footed. The Scerzo is alert, speedy, and totally successful. I always hear Karajan's searing finale in my ears, but Solti comes fairly close. In all, a good Seventh keeping up with the Eroica and Pastoral.\n\nThe 1st Sym. copies the style of the 2nd in being ig-boned, forceful, and romantic. The recording is especially good, giving us lots of woodwind detail and impact in the orchestra's wide dynamic range. There's not a puny note here, which is a mized blessing in a work that cries out for delicacy and wit. Of its overblown kind, however, this is a good reading that never sags.\n\nCD 5 contains the Leonore Over. #3, the 4th Sym., and the first movement of the Ninth.  Splitting the 9th on to two discs isn't a sin, but Decca has been stingy with timings: most Beethoven cycles fit on 5 CDs without overtures, or perhaps one. Solti's Fourth is in the same traditional style as his Eighth; it's given weight and iportance but ddoesn't sag. Despite a fairly impersonal slow movement, the other movements are satisfying. The Leonore #3 is forceful and dramatic, lacking only what it must have: blazing inspiration. But if you have hung in this long, I think you will find Solti better--and more traditional--at Beethoven than his take-no-prisoners reputation would lead us to believe.\n\nCD 6 completes the 9th Sym., whose first movement on the preceding CD, was forthright and dramatic but lacking in mystery. If you just want to hear a first-rate orchestra playing in excellent sound, this certainly fits the bill. If you want to hear a new or individual take on a masterpiece, it doesn't. The Scherzo proceeds very well, with Solti keeping the rhythm alive and alert. The  Adagio, at 19 min., is one of the slower ones; this tempo requires the conductor to keep an unwavering conentration. Solti certainly controls his forces well--even Karajan doesn't give us a better played rendition. But by trying for a hushed, reverent atmosphere, Solti misses the music's spsiritual intensity. This is one movement you must conduct form the inside, from your own deep emotions, and Solti doesn't.\n\nThe theatricality of the choral finale is more up his alley. He's ore involved, and the exciting parts are very exciting, with the CSO lower strings outdoing all rivals for richness and accuracy. Solti's apaproach is too straightforward, however, missing much in terms of real eloquence and emotional depth.  Marti Talvela makes a stunning, sonorous bass soloist, and the rest of the quartet is fine. The Chicago chorus is world-class, of course, and far exceeds the woolly, wobbly Vienna Singverein that Karajan used three times on DG. Several reviewers have called this 9th the high point of Solti's cycle, and I tend to agree.\n\nIn sum, a more satisfying Beethoven set than I expected, with excellent sonics and great playing from the CSO. Solti isn't profound, but his other virtues shine through.","classification":4,"fold":8}

The song really has been more of a far departure into what she was starting to make in good songs.

I read he wrote it regarding the time he spent living with Evangelical Christian guardians as a youth.  The song also has a melody that seems like a parody of children's sing-along shows a la Barney(sp?).  \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is full of fire and life, \"In Bloom\" feels weak in comparison, but has good beefy bass driven production and one gets the impression that it has a purpose, although its anyone's guess as to what he's singing about (again, thanks to Wikipedia for providing that info free of charge!  Not like I needed to know anyway, but thanks!!).  \"Come As You Are\" is a somber piece, with an almost march-like beat, until the chorus gives way.  I used to associate \"I swear I don't have a gun\" with his 1994 alleged suicide (some swear his wife did it), but it occurred to me a few days ago, he probably meant to convey, \"Come as you are because I come in peace\".

{"text":"Dylan's career epitomizes change. He has buffeted and tossed fans around on a wild sea of change and reinvention since 1965 (when he picked up an electric guitar in defiance of the folk community's unwritten rules). The year 1979 saw his most shocking transition. One that challenged and threatened Dylan's career like no other. Dylan began espousing Christianity and throwing around the term \"born again\". Jerry Wexler, who produced \"Slow Train Coming\", told Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin that \"I had no idea he was on this born-again Christian trip until he started to evangelize me.\" Wexler diplomatically told Dylan to back off, but he produced the album anyway. So in the heyday of punk the performer many people associated, fairly or unfairly, with 1960s \"radicalism\" turned explicitly Christian. Not only that, 1978's \"Street Legal\" met with an extremely icy reception. For many fans Dylan's new \"phase\" was too much.\n\nDylan's \"Christian phase\" (though arguably not a phase) now looks somewhat innocuous from a historical perspective. After two (some say one, some say three) more \"Christian\" albums, Dylan's lyrics morphed once again. Would his career have survived had he plunged permanently into Christian music? Hard to say. Many thought he was through in 1965. He may have simply found a different audience (though in the 1970s that audience would probably have been a small one). Regardless, the 1980s were probably the low point of Dylan's career from many perspectives.\n\n\"Slow Train Coming\" is a Christian album. It makes no apologies for this. Though far less preachy than its successor, \"Saved\", the theme of the album remains unmistakable. \"When He Returns\", the album's passionate closer, more than demonstrates this with lines such as \"He's got plans of his own to set up His throne when He returns\".\n\nWhether or not listeners accept this album most likely depends on their attitude towards the lyrics. Because there's nothing wrong with the music on \"Slow Train Coming\". \"Gotta Serve Somebody\" grooves in a way that Dylan had never really grooved previously. \"Precious Angel\" features Mark Knoplfer's distinctive guitar style and probably one of the best Dylan drawls ever recorded: \"Ya know I just couldn't make it by myself. I'm a little too blind to seeeEEEeeeeee.\" \"Slow Train\" contains an ominous groove. \"When you Gonna Wake Up\" lashes out at society's failings. Whether one agrees with the religious perspective or not, the criticism here seems valid and constructive. Only \"Man Gave Names To All The Animals\" sounds a little trite. Everything else on \"Slow Train Coming\" receives passion and conviction. Again, whether or not one agrees with the overall message, Dylan's performance is outstanding on this album (it even bagged him a Grammy for \"Best Rock Vocal\" - something his detractors, especially those who find his distinctive voice grating, must have cringed at).\n\n\"Slow Train Coming\" just adds proof to the argument that Bob Dylan remains one of the most provocative, controversial, and intruiguing artists of the 20th century. Apart from the music, he's given his fans plenty of challenges, and given future generations an almost insurmountable amount of material to ponder and debate about.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"The band's smart marketing has paid off.  The advance release of the title single \"Need You Now\" lifted the band to the top of the country charts for five weeks.  Its Youtube instructional video of the song's guitar work encouraged coffeehouse players to further the song's spread.  The week the album was released, the band, a Grammy nominee for its 2009 debut album, performed \"Need You Now\" on the 2010 Grammies.  It's clear why this single has clicked; it's pure Fleetwood Mac, from the three-part harmonies lacing the chorus to the late-night, post-breakup regrets addressed in the lyrics.  All the songs on the album are strong; Dave Haywood, Charles Kelley, and Hillary Scott collaborated with varying fourth writers on most of the tracks, but there's a unity to their writing styles.  While the rest of the album is loaded with similarly layered vocals and a country-rock edge easily embraceable by fans of the Eagles, Little Big Town, Devonsquare, or Bryndle, the simple single will pop back into your head when you least -- \"It's a quarter after one, and I'm all alone, and I need you now.\" - expect it.  ****","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"I absolutely love this one. I listen to it most of the time. It is most excellent for assisting me with cognition and allowing my imagination to flow freely. I tend to fall asleep to this music as well. I am a hermit and I have no friends or family so I welcome the music. It is comforting, soothing, and invigorating. I do have one complaint = You're paying for 100 tracks and they separate each \"piece\" by their movements and count each movement as a track. frankly it should be 100 individual masterpieces, it is a bit misleading. I have noted that most of these collections are made up in that format or they only play a single movement of the piece.\n\nOn the flip side of this, I prefer this one over the ones that split it and only play one part of the piece. for example the sonatas I'll take the Sonata no. 12 in F Major for Piano as a prime example: It isn't a sonata without the other two movements. That is part of the sonata form without it you have no \"sonata.\" A suite has multiple parts and same with a symphony you can't just leave one section out for one portion. It would be like boasting a great collection of movies but only playing part of the movie through in favor of fitting more in.\n\nI highly recommend this album. I would absolutely die if I couldn't hear the full sonata no 12 in F Major. It didn't become a masterpiece just by a small excerpt, it was the full piece they considered. Otherwise, we would have millions of masterpieces. It could be a couple decibels louder on some pieces. To remedy this, I just stick my phone or tablet on my wooden desk to increase the level. An easy fix.","classification":5,"fold":8}

I know the rap gods has blessed us all because the game was getting too soft, fragile, boring,suspect and weak. General 50 Cent has rounded up the troops to unleash that hard to the core dangerous bust your head open hip hop music. I truly did not see this wonderful surprise coming but here we are big baby! Instant bangers like\"watch me\", \"the plug\", and the sinister \"I don't F with you\" makes this EP remind the masses just how unstoppable the Unit still is in hip hop. Banks sounds sharper than ever on this EP. Young buck always was my personal favorite out the crew, and buck bodies every verse as usual. New addition Kidd Kidd from New Orleans is a great fit in the Unit with his street linquistic rhyme acumen and witty punchlines. Even Tony Yayo stepped up his lyricism to make this G-Unit reunion a true heat rock album. 50 Cent sounds like he has a battery in his back, because he is so energized and full of vigor and confidence like its 2003 again!

And this song showcases that to the nth degree. Yep, like it or not, those days are making a comeback.\n\nThe song is an universally inspirational ballad, in the same vein of \"You Raise Me Up,\" and so many others, complete with huge chorus and finale. Taken from the famous poem I believe, Leona belts out the song in such unoriginal fashion, most people will have serious deja vu, but that won't stop them from eating it up. It could be a huge song on any number of radio formats, and it's the perfect world eating follow-up to \"Bleeding Love.\"\n\nOverall, if you love this type of song, this is about the best thing that's ever happened to you, it rivals Josh Groban, and if they play their cards right, it could dominate radio for years to come. As for me, I'm a little on the blah side, although it doesn't irk me as much as the 90's divas. Nope, Leona is better, and she could be the next big thing.

{"text":"5 Stars if you're new to Eisley; 4 Stars for the rest of us\n\nEisley has released 2 EPs in early and late 2003, the excellent \"Laughing City\" and \"Marvelous Things\". For whatever reason, it's taken over another year for the release of their debut album. The band is in my book one of the best new bands out there, and Coldplay's Chris Martin is a big fan as well (Eisley opened for Coldplay on part of their 2003 US tour).\n\n\"Room Noises\" (12 tracks, 41 min.) is full of dreamy, yet very catchy songs, not unlike, say, Sixpense None the Richer. The best songs are in the first half of the album, including the opener \"Memories\", \"I Wasn't Prepared\", \"Memories\" (the standout track of the album), and \"Brightly Wounded\" with great intertwining vocals from the sister lead singers. Other great tracks are \"Plenty of Paper\", a great up-tempo song, and the closer \"Trolley Wood\".\n\nWhat keeps me from giving this 5 stars is that 4 of the songs are rehashed from the 2 EPs (in newly recorded versions), and that's disappointing to a degree for those of us that have followed Eisley from the beginning. We want more new songs! Finally, the Amazon listing shows a bonus track (a remixed version of \"Lost at Sea\") but the CD I bought doesn't have it, hmmmm... Regardless, Eisley is a breath of fresh air in today's music scene.  Eisley is coming to Cincinnati shortly and I can't wait to see them live! \"Room Noises\" is highly recommended!","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Beautiful Liar (Beyonce & Shakira) \/ B0018Q16DU\n\nBeyonce and Shakira both have incredible voices, so this duet is nothing short of perfect blend of perfect talent, and is worth listening to for that fact alone. But I also dearly like the lyrics - the song is between two women who find out that the man they trusted has been seeing them both, secretly. Instead of the more common musical fight over who will win him in the end (see Brandy's lovely&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Boy-Is-Mine\/dp\/B000007NCC\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Boy Is Mine<\/a>), Beyonce and Shakira ask one another if they can't just consider themselves lucky for finding out when they did, and can't they just laugh it off and go on with their lives? What, really, have they 'lost' beyond a \"beautiful liar\"?\n\nWhat's really meaningful is that though the two women recognize that the best response would be to shrug the whole thing off and move on, it's clear that this response is by no means easy and that the process is still unfairly agonizing to both women. It's a rare song that manages to be empowered without being trite, and realistic without being overwhelmed with self-pity.\n\n~ Ana Mardoll","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"(2 & 1\/2 stars) In my youth Chicago was one of my very favorite bands - in the top 2 or 3 for sure.  When I played trumpet back then, I even had the trumpet parts memorized from songs like \"Questions 67 and 68.\"  I even enjoyed their more \"lite rock\" phase of the '80s.  But all of that was then and this is now.  Their new \"XXX\" is not so hot.  The main problem is epitomized by the 2nd track on the CD, \"King of Might Have Been.\"  It's a mildly pretty ballad along the lines of \"You're The Inspiration.\"  The big obvious differences are in the current talent then versus now.  \"Inspiration\" featured the winning vocals of Peter Cetera (no longer in the band); \"King\" has the merely competent Jason Scheff singing.  The new song was produced and arranged by Jay DeMarcus (who?); \"Inspiration\" was filled with shimmering, subtle and beautiful touches created by the incomparable David Foster.  \"King\" is a very ordinary and unmemorable tune; \"Inspiration\" is a classic that was co-written by Cetera and Foster.  And that example pretty much represents what happens on the album as a whole.  It's undoubtedly unfair to compare this new CD to Chicago's glory days, but the fact remains that it's a pale imitation.\n\nA couple of thoughts regarding the CD's title.  First, the album count has gotten shakier over the years.  I don't think that every regurgitated and repackaged collection (ex., \"Chicago Love Songs\") should count toward the total.  So really they are nowhere near 30 albums.  Second, the movie rating implications of \"XXX\" seem to have completely escaped them, as there is no mention of anything relating to that in the album booklet or art.","classification":2,"fold":8}

However, this is exactly what's happened in the last couple of weeks.\nFirst of all, the Bach Guild\/Vanguard released its \"Bigger Bach Set\" (14 hours) for an introductory price of .99 cents, so I grabbed it. They also cut the price of their earlier Big Bach Set release (9 hours) back down to .99 cents, so I grabbed that at the same. Now VoxBox has released Bach's Complete Organ Works (14 hours), played by Walter Kraft, for $1.09, so of course I grabbed that immediately. That's 37 hours for a little over 3 bucks. Wow!\nI'm wondering if Vox, with its massive back catalog of major and minor composers in job lots (they specialized in complete runs of somebody's output) has decided to get into the big and bigger MP3 download game, competing head to with Bach Guild (and like them leading with Bach). No doubt Vox noticed that these Bach Guild releases were shooting to #1 among classical MP3s, and sometimes to #1 among ALL MP3 downloads (including Rock). In fact, #1 in all MP3 downloads is exactly where this mega-set is right now.\n\nI'm not a big organ music guy, but this seems like an excellent place to start. The sound seems to me very good for its vintage, and my family is complaining about the bass vibration from my downstairs office, so I guess they feel the same about the sound. The Kraft performance I've sampled (family static permitting) seem to me not virtuosic but soberly satisfying, which suits me fine for starters.\n\nMy advice would be to grab this while it's still $1.09. And I at least am going to keep my eye out for more VoxBox releases.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"'On My Way to the Sun' is John's follow-up to 'Revolution of Mind' released back in 2009 carrying the Mastedon name also from back in his earlier days.  As one reviewer already noted this was fan funded by Kickstarter which I was proudly a contributor.  The cd kicks off with the 11 minute epic \"This is How the Story Goes\" which guest stars Richard Williams and David Ragsdale, both from Kansas.  It definitely shows as during the course of the song I really thought I was listening to Kansas and for those out there that wish there would be new Kansas tunes at some point, this might be the closest thing that you might get.  From there, the balance of the album is your typical rock oriented tunes with the classic Elefante trademark and to the point lyrics all focusing on what this album is all about.  Is this album better than 'Revolution of Mind'?  Not sure.  For me, personally, I like 'Revolution of Mind' a touch better because it just had a harder edge and as much as I was anticipating the 11 minute song (which I knew would be on this album early on) I'm not sure if measures up to \"One Day Down by the Lake\" off his previous effort which is just an outstanding song, and to be honest, would be hard to top.  Not taking anything away from the album here, it's still a very solid effort on John's part and for those Christian artists out there in the mainstream that think they measure up to John, fat chance.  Over the years, John's voice has definitely gotten better and stronger and it would be really cool if the members of Kansas could actually sit down and write an album and have John sing lead.  I think today, John would blow away anything he did in the albums 'Vinyl Confessions' and 'Drastic Measures' while he was with Kansas back in the eighties.  This is a great album and although I might differ on my personal preference from his last album to this one, it's still a much welcomed release and a breath of fresh air in a market that desperately needs it.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Pink Floyd's new album The Endless River is a MUST FOR ALL FANS!\nI have been a lifelong Floydian since my mom (may she RIP) played me The Dark Side of the Moon as a tot. Then from age 7 onwards I acquired each album on cassette then to CD (my favorites are Wish You Were Here, The Division Bell, Meddle, The Wall and Atom Heart Mother) and even solo albums. Then also saw the band on its last tour in 1994 in lieu of my senior prom (still the best concert I ever attended and I don't do any drugs AT ALL).\nIn 1995 promoting the live album PULSE, guitarist\/singer\/songwriter David Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason said Pink Floyd would return in the not too distant future and The Division Bell Tour was not to be the last tour but changes in Gilmour's personal life (four more kids with wife Polly Samson) PLUS the deaths of long-time manager Steve O'Rourke in 2003, Pink Floyd co-founder\/keyboard player\/songwriter Rick Wright in 2008 and album cover expert Storm Thorgerson in 2013 slammed the brakes on any full Floyd return (sans one-off performances in 2003 at O'Rourke's funeral, 2005 with Roger Waters at Live 8, 2006 at Royal Albert Hall with post-Waters lineup and 2007 at the Syd Barrett tribute concert again the post-Waters lineup).\nThen this past July, when I heard the news that Pink Floyd was releasing a new album, I WAS SHOCKED, SURPRISED AND EXCITED! Then hearing the Roger Waters bellyachers and doubters complain \"it's outtakes from The Division Bell\" and \"no Roger Waters no Pink Floyd\" made me anticipate it more with happiness. It's partially Division Bell outtakes plus some new bits recorded at David's new home studio in addition to parts recorded in 1993\/94 (and one bit, 1968). I know it's not a final album like Coda from Led Zeppelin (which was outtakes and two of them had new things added) nor Queen's Made in Heaven (which was re-workings of solo Mercury tracks and unreleased tunes) nor Let it Be by The Beatles nor the atrocity that was Calling All Stations by Genesis. The Endless River is musical heaven IMHO! I got my CD-BluRay two days early and after 10 listens in FOUR DAYS, the album has quickly become my FOURTH FAVORITE PINK FLOYD ALBUM EVER!\nWe begin with Side 1 which is three instrumentals. First is \"Things Left Unsaid\" which has spoken bits from Rick, David and Nick before going into synths from Rick and Bob Ezrin and David's e-bowed guitar. Then \"It's What We Do\" which reminds me of a cross between \"Welcome to the Machine\" with the chord structure and synth sounds meets \"Marooned\" with David's whammy pedal guitar meets \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" beat wise and ends with the relaxing e-bow guitars and keyboards that make up \"Ebb and Flow\" which made this first movement excellent.\nSide 2 begins with \"Sum\" which is the first Gilmour\/Mason\/Wright collaboration since Dark Side on an album and begins with the keyboard effect of \"Cluster One\" before kicking into a killer instrumental which reminds me of \"One of These Days\" come \"Welcome to the Machine\" with David's lap steel screaming and Nick's drumming more alive than it's been in years. Then we have \"Skins\" which is a Nick Mason drum solo which just shows he can still play great at age 70 (not been this adventurous since Pompeii). Then \"Unsung\" is next and is just Gilmour and Wright with a great short ditty before ending with \"Anisina\" which is so beautiful with David's lap steel guitar and also piano work and a superb Strat solo at the end and the sax and clarinet work from Gilad Atzmon is excellent (Dick Parry was off touring with The Violent Femmes so was not available).\nSide 3 starts with \"The Lost Art of Conversation\" which sets the mood for the next suite of songs which also has \"On Noodle Street\" which has some noodlings by Rick and David and superb! We follow with \"Night Light\" which is another great interlude before going to \"Allons-y 1\" which is a great piece now with solos and lap steel whereas the full version is just a great jam. Then it's \"Autumn 68\" with Wright playing the Royal Albert Hall organ (recorded in 1968) with great results (reminding me of things from Saucerful of Secrets and the outro to \"Cymbaline\" on the More Soundtrack) before a reprise of \"Allons-y 2\" hits to bookend this segment and ends with \"Talkin Hawkin\" which features Stephen Hawking's voice samples talking about communication and a great little piece to end the third segment.\nSide 4 begins with \"Calling\" which was written by Gilmour and Anthony Moore with some more synths and guitars. \"Eyes to Pearls\" follows and is more guitar from David, keyboards from Rick and drums from Nick. Then it's \"Surfacing\" which reminds me of \"Poles Apart\" with the acoustic guitar and drums with some excellent oohs and ahhs from David and Durga McBroom and lap steel work from David. We end with the only song with vocals \"Louder Than Words\" which is a great song and sums up the Pink Floyd odyssey with perfection and is a great closing track to this album.\nThe CD\/Blu-Ray edition also has the album in Surround Sound plus some more songs not on the album like \"TBS 9\", \"TBS 14\" and \"Nervana\". The former are keyboard and guitar jams and the latter is a rocking instrumental. Plus some footage of run throughs of \"Nervana\", \"Allonsy\", \"Untitled\", two versions of \"Avrika\" (which became Wearing the Inside Out) and a 2014 run through of \"Anisina\" before overdubs. Plus a superb hard cover book with lyrics and credits and pictures and postcards.\nSince The Endless River is Pink Floyd's final album they are going out with a masterpiece which proves that the music of Pink Floyd is more powerful than one member it was \"THE SUM WAS GREATER THAN THE PARTS\"!\nThe Endless River is RECOMMENDED!","classification":5,"fold":8}

It truly lacks the Head and the Heart. I mean I bought their previous two albums years ago and I still go back to them because they have that depth. It's not just the quality of the music but the heart and soul that clearly went into it. I don't think that Signs of Light has that.\n\nI think with Signs of Light, as it is their first major record label release, they are trying to reach a wider, mainstream audience and because of that, A majority of the album really comes off as radio ready pop hits. Not to say that they aren't solid songs but again, They lack that heart and soul that went into previous works. And by doing that, I really do think it isolates their original core audience and that's pretty evident by the reviews posted for the album.\n\nSigns of Light is a solid album and certainly worthy of 3 stars but it doesn't have any lasting quality. Once I go tired of listening to it, It's just gonna chill on the cloud service for a good long time.","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"Weezer's infamous self-titled debut (otherwise known as \"The Blue Album\") is one of the few pieces of music from it's time that still holds up just as well today. When they made their mark in 1994, Kurt Cobain was dead and the music world had already been oversaturated by mumbling, uninspiring grunge clones. Although Weezer never quite changed the musical climate, they did, however, create a quite perfect debut, one that transcends all genres and inspires new bands even today. Few groups that materialized at this time are still around today, but Weezer remain vital, and each song on this ten track debut remains an alternative rock staple. You can't throw a cat in a crowded room without hitting someone who, whether they realize it or not, knows a good Weezer tune. So, it only makes sense that on the tenth anniversary of the release, a Deluxe Edition made it's way with all new artwork and a bonus disc full of b-sides, outtakes, demos, live songs etc. The question is, is it worth buying again?\n\nThe answer? A resounding yes. For starters, I'm sure most owners of this album have put plenty of wear and tear on it, what better time to get yourself another copy. And even if it's still in perfect condition, the bonus material is worth it alone, for the Weezer fanatic. I don't have to tell you how good the original album is. You've heard it, you know. It's perfect, front to back. The material on the second disc, while admittedly not as good as the album itself, is still worthy. Take, for example, Rivers' catchy ode to the presidents of the Weezer fanclub, \"Mykel and Carli\" (who passed away in a tragic car accident), with it's chorus that, in typical Weezer fashion, sticks in your head for the rest of your life. \"Suzanne\" and \"Jamie\" are probably the most well-known b-sides among Weezer fans, while a trio of demos -- referred to as \"The Kitchen Tapes\" -- digs a bit deeper into Weezer history. There are also live songs (\"My Name Is Jonas\" & \"Surf Wax America\") and acoustic versions (\"Jamie\" and \"No One Else\"), and to top it all off, for the diehard fans, the original mix of \"Say It Ain't So\" (which was released only in the early pressings of the Blue Album). Also included is a rather elaborate booklet which includes lyrics (finally) and liner notes that chronicle the early history of Weezer. The package is very well done, and surely outshines the bare-bones nature of the original release.\n\nOverall, a good album just got even better. Despite it's price tag, the average Weezer fan just should not be without this. It might make you love the band even more. You definitely get your money's worth. And as I said before, the original album itself is just classic. Say what you will about Weezer's newer material, but this stuff just can't be beat. They definitely deserve their popularity and their place in modern rock royalty. I really think anyone and everyone can appreciate the Blue Album, an accomplishment a lot of musicians cannot acheive.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I tend to avoid albums like this, generally because by the time they are released, the tracks on them have appeared on up to half a dozen greatest hits sets already. For the life of me, I can't see any reason for albums like this, other than greed & the lust to milk the cash cow even further. It's a bit like DVD's where you get the original release, then the \"special edition\", then the 2-disc set with extra bits not seen in the theatre release, then the director's cut, then the \"ultimate edition\" and so on, ad nauseum. Lets get real here, the record companies are not stupid; they see a way to leech more money out of the die-hard fans, & they will. It's as simple as that! And sadly, none of the artists have the ethical conscience to say to the companies, \"hey, haven't we already released greatest hits albums?\" Why do we have to re-release them under a new cover, & call it a new release? It's all about the mighty dollar, baby, and they all do it. Now, having said that (& got my feelings of disgust for record companies of my back), this album has one (yes, just one) positive - it has one of the best cover versions of \"Ring of Fire\" that I have ever heard. Great vocals from Alan, great production, & great instrumental backing. Now this is the kind of number I'd like to hear Alan doing in future. Put \"Freight Train\" behind him (every artist is allowed to make one disaster in their career), and look to churning out numbers that have some life in them. Alan, go back to your roots, check out your first 3 or 4 albums, and start again. Lets have more of the kind of songs that put you on the map as a genuine country singer, and put an end to the lame & tame rubbish like \"Freight Train\".","classification":1,"fold":8}

{"text":"With the first track, the full play is revealed. And I was captivated. Lyrically stylistic and substantial. Astonishing that Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote the book, lyrics, and music. The story unfolds adding depth and development to the history I had learned a long time ago. This is personal, flawed, heroic, intense, intelligence with passion... Alexander Hamilton.\n\nOn the Amazon mp3 player, I am able to use X-Ray Lyrics to read the lyrics to most of the tracks. And after reading the lyrics, my respect and admiration have grown. The rhymes, rap, play on words have me singing along out loud, and the repeated parts of songs are impressive and act as smooth transitions between scenes and connect the action. The amount of information that is included in the songs blows my mind. I got a fairly clear picture of Alexander Hamilton as well as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Lafayette.\n\nHistory comes alive through the songs. There's rap, hip hop, R&B, and more. I've listened to the complete soundtrack at least four times, which I have not done with any other musical. I have listened to individual songs more often than that. I find myself humming or singing along to songs, even after I've stopped listening to the soundtrack. Favorites include: Wait for It, Ten Duel Commandments, Cabinet Battle #1, and Your Obedient Servant. I laughed out loud to some of the songs, was tearful for others, and hooked by the whole.\n\nI want to read Hamilton by Ron Chernow, the book which inspired Lin-Manuel to write the musical. I also want to know more about the American Revolution. This musical has brought history to life for me. It seems so much more exciting than it did in the books I once read about it, memorizing battles and dates.\n\nThanks to Amazon Prime, I was able to listen to the complete soundtrack after hearing raving reviews for the play. I was so curious. And of course, I have to see the play. The Grammy performance whet my desire to see the Broadway play with the original cast, if possible. Also, I have purchased the soundtrack because I HAD to own it.\n\nI could not have told you previously who was on the US $10 bill, but now whenever I get a $10 bill I call it a Hamilton. And I smile because I imagine that he would have loved to know how his life and contribution are being celebrated.","classification":5,"fold":8}

In retrospect, if you're still playing Stones albums -- and you should be -- these three hold up among the best. The new Universal remasters are so fine it's scary. What a gorgeous job. I've got a $10,000 stereo, and, trust me, it's been dying to hear CDs that sound this good. Those of you on mp3 and music on the computer and iPod and all that, you do not know what you're missing. All others, give \"Black and Blue\" a revisit. The Stones are not emphasizing songs here, but the old line that this was the album they just tried out new guitarists after Mick Taylor split is lazy reviewing become accepted fact. The Stones are in superb, coiled form here. Yes, there are not a lot of songs, but the band was exploring jams at this point, tinged with Jamaican vibes, dance floor repetition and nuance in the shifting layers of sound and rhythm. \"Hot Stuff,\" \"Hey Negrita\" -- both are brilliant. The two ballads are classics. Crazy Mama, particularly in the remaster, is an overwhelmingly joyful rocker from the Faces school. \"Melody\" is a great lost Stones song, and the semi-duds (\"Hand of Fate,\" which some love, and \"Cherry Oh Baby\") certainly are not embarrassing. I, frankly, love this album, what? Thirty some years on. Buy it, get your Ya Ya's out, and turn it loud.","classification":5,"fold":8}
{"text":"There is honestly so much that I have loved about the simplicity of Ed Sheeran, and his own work. Musically, he has written some excellent songs over the past few years. While I was not that thrilled about the first few singles from his X album, Don't and Sing, which both of them sounded more like he has lost his appeal in his own work. But honestly, I did feel he ignited again from the soul of the heart when he released his last single, Thinking Out Loud last year. It really showed his best craft in songwriting, is making songs from simplicity. His latest single, also follows suite very nicely. Photograph is a very simple pop song that shows his continued growth in his own music well. I do like the song, and it shows him in the ranking of songwriters like Paul Simon and James Taylor at the heart of the matter, and is definitely one of those songs worth the effort.

I Do Not Hook Up, the second single from her 4th album All I Ever Wanted feels like it is just one in the same from her pervious earlier songs. It really isn't a great song after a few times, and feels like it has lost its luster very quickly.

But with I Wanna Dance With Somebody, helping her sophmore album, Whitney, become the first by a female artist to debut at #1 on Billboard. The song is a beautiful anthem that still remains classy and true to her sound. Sadly, though with Whitney passing away on the 25th anniversary of Whitney debuting at #1 on Billboard, it is so hard to celebrate her right now, without grieveing for all of her fans and myself too. While Lady Gaga paid homage to Whitney with Fashion Of His Love for her album Born This Way, nothing will ever replace the smile, joy and love Whitney Houston had with that song, and Whitney will always want to dance with somebody. Now, she is dancing up there with her dad, John Houston whom died 9 years ago. One day, will we all want to dance together with Whitney.\n\nWhitney Houston 1963-2012\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Jewel Kilcher's recent musical and style change is perhaps the biggest public makeover in years. Once she was a guitar-strumming folk girl. Now she's reinvented herself as the American Kylie Minogue with \"0304,\" a catchy but overpolished collection of dance-pop songs.\nThe more philosophical side of Jewel seems to linger in the slow-paced \"Stand\" (\"It's a shame there's no one to blame\/for all the pain that life brings...\"). But that vanishes with the wispy \"Run 2 U\" and pale \"2 Find U,\" both colorless dance tunes. Some of the necessary verve and power reappears with the catchy \"Intuition,\" bouncy USA-themed song \"America,\" and shimmying \"Yes U Can.\" A more gothic sensibility surfaces in the distorted, ominous \"Haunted.\"\nNobody expects dance-pop to be deep -- all it has to be is catchy. And \"0304\" isn't deep. It's just a collection of mid-level dance music, with mediocre lyrics, acceptable vocals and packaged electronic pop music. We've seen it all before, but Jewel's offering isn't bad. Instead, it just fails to be really good.\nWhen you hear Jewel's voice, you can tell that all the flaws have been scrupulously polished out. In past albums, her voice had minor imperfections. No more. It's not an exceptional voice, but neither is it bad; it's suited for the dance music she produces here, which isn' too taxing.  Musically, it can't be denied that \"0304\" is very catchy. Jewel flavors the dance-pop with hints of jazz (the accordion in \"Intuition\") and replaces her acoustic guitars with electric and bass. Okay, the acoustic guitars are still there, but good luck finding them.\nUnfortunately the songs are essentially empty. Jewel has a good ear for rhythm and rhyme, but there's nothing really interesting about these songs. They're just ordinary dance-pop. (\"If u want my love\/u can try my love\/u can't buy my love\/just take my hand\") The only exceptions to this are \"Stand\" and the sinister, stalker theme song \"Haunted.\" Ironically, these two are the best of this album.\n\"0304\" may prove to be a mixed blessing for Jewel. It's catchy and danceable but essentially empty. Only time will tell if the folkie-turned-popster's new sound will take.","classification":3,"fold":8}

Harrison and McCartney. I think George's stuff here could have been freeze-dried for a hearty repast on any number of 1963-64 Beatles l.p.s. \"Crying, Wating, and Hoping\" is beautiful - as usual the guys do an exceptional take on Buddy Holly. Paul's \"Besame Mucho\" (improved by June, 1962; see Anthology I.) has inrrestistible nervous energy on this January, 1962 try.\n\nThe big reason I bought this CD are the three Lennon and McCartney compositions, \"Like Dreamers Do\", \"Hello, Little Girl\", and \"Love of the Loved\", which originally arrived via Beatles' friends' discs. \"Dreamers\" might catch the extra attention of Roy Orbison fans, as the title sings out the same phrase from Roy's Classic, \"In Dreams\".\n\nSound is very good, not great - VG is not up to standards.

{"text":"It is just so sad that whenever someone young and talented passes away so soon, you're really often reminded of the great talent they left behind at the soul. Al Jarreau has had so many great songs from jazz and pop that floated very brilliantly at the heart, and each time I really do hear one of his song, I really love his soulful gift at the heart. But when I do think of all of the songs that he brilliantly sung since the 70's, all I can absolutely think of is just one simple song that still ignites at the soul from television. The theme from the Bruce Willis 80's show Moonlighting, which has been enriched at the heart. The theme from Moonlighting still shows a brilliance in jazz and the engrained heart of pop culture. It is still one of those deep guilty pleasure songs that works today, just like it did back in the 80's, 90's and 2000's. Al really had a gift from the heart that swooned so many people time and time again. He will definitely be missed every time you hear the moonlight soul.

{"text":"When it comes to ethereal adult alternative music, the two staples have been Sarah McLachlan and Dido.  The latest entry from these two is Dido's Girl Who Got Away.  Some albums I can size up quickly while others take me a while to process.  This one falls into the latter category.\n\nOf Dido's four albums, Girl Who Got Away leans the heaviest toward R&B.  This is most evident on \"Let Us Move On\" where Kendrick Lamar makes a guest appearance.  However, \"Blackbird\", \"End Of Night\", and um, let's say track #7, also have similar qualities.  The R&B slant was not across the board, however.  Some tracks have a sparser feel to them such as \"Sitting On Top Of The World\", \"Happy New Year\", and \"Day Before We Went To War\".\n\nWhile the style may have some different nuances, there is a common feel to the songs.  Some, such as \"No Freedom\", \"Let Us Move On\", \"Blackbird\", \"Happy New Year\", and \"Loveless Hearts\" deal with love gone wrong or lost.  For example, \"No Freedom\" has the line \"By the look in your eyes I can tell\/You Don't think I'll be back for more.\" while \"Blackbird\" has \"Why do I bring you love\/When all you give me back is pain?\".The overall album leaves me with a sense of melancholy, and it is one that I listen to when I want to unwind or when I am going to sleep.\n\nGirl Who Got Away is another great album from Dido, and I highly recommend it to old and new fans alike.\n\nDownload this:  No Freedom","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"There are going to be hundreds of reviews of this album out there (and yes, I'm old, I still call them albums) and I know I'm not in Taylor's main demographic audience.  First off, I'm a guy.  Second off I'm 42 years old and normally listen to things like Irish punk, The Beatles, Springsteen or some hard core country like Chris Knight.  I love big band music whether it's Frank Sinatra or Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.  With all of that said, I adore Taylor and this new album \"Red.\"\n\nTaylor's songwriting is still in fine form here.  The thing that always amazes me about her writing is that she's able to tell stories in her songs, she keeps it simple and more often than not finds one heck of a hook in the chorus.  There is passion, there's energy and there is joy.  Sure, there are so sad songs, but it seems to my that Taylor takes so much joy in making music that it's hard as a listener not to get caught up in that with her.\n\nAfter listening to the 16 tracks and the 6 bonus tracks available on some packages I have to say that Taylor's bonus tracks alone are better than what most artists are putting out as albums these days.  The \"demo\" recordings of \"Treacherous,\" \"Red\" and \"State of Grace\" are excellent and polished works that are just a bit more stripped down than the versions that appear on the album.  It's not really fair to call them demos, as when I hear that word I'm expecting below-par sound and performance.  I think it's the mark of a good song if it can be done solo-acoustic (or at least very stripped down) and these three songs certainly hold up well.\n\nFor me the whole album is very solid, there are no songs on this disc that I'd skip when listening to it.  There is a nice mix of slower ballads and hard hitting rock numbers.  Make no mistake about it, Taylor Swift is a rock and roll star.  She's setting the bar for what pop music is and doing a fine job of it.  It's funny, while listening to \"Red\" and the big anthmatic numbers I couldn't help but think this is the modern day version of Phil Spector's wall of sound.  Sure, there are a lot of synthesizers here, but Taylor has an uncanny ability to create a big sound that just envelops you, especially if you like to play your music as loud as I do.\n\nI think it's the fact that Taylor is such a good songwriter and maybe more importantly storyteller that makes her so accessible across so many different lines.  It doesn't matter how old you are or what gender you are, Taylor's songs resonate.  Even a song like \"22\" which is an anthem for the young \"let's go out and party\" crowd it still hits home with me at 42, because believe it or not kids I was 22 at one point.  And, I'm guessing the 10 year olds that hear the song will relate to it because they know it's exactly what they're going to want to do when they're 22.\n\nRed is a little bit country, a lot of pop and a heavy dose of rock and roll.  Like some big artists before her, Taylor Swift is not a follower, but instead she is creating the standard for what is popular music.  And maybe this is the old man in me coming out, but where most of popular music is fairly brainless and devoid of substance that's the opposite of what Taylor Swift brings to the table.  She brings some great story songs, most of which (if not all) I'm pretty sure are very auto-biographical.  Taylor is simply telling us her story, she's just making it rhyme and adding some killer hooks and melodies for good measure.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor, infamous for long delays between albums, sure has been productive lately. 2007 saw Reznor release the critically acclaimed \"Year Zero\" and its' follow-up \"Year Zero Remixed.\" In addition, last year Reznor produced Saul Williams' \"The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of Niggy Tardust.\" Now, out of nowhere, with no advance notice, Reznor is back with NIN's sixth album, the instrumental \"Ghosts I-IV.\"\n\n\"A soundtrack for daydreams,\" is how Reznor sums up the new album...and that, I feel, is the best way to appreciate the new NIN. Rather than listening to this album as background music while driving or doing housework, \"Ghosts I-IV\" is best appreciated with relaxed, yet concentrated listening. Lie in bed or on the sofa, relaxed, and immerse yourself with this CD. Just sort of daydream--meditate, think about whatever...and let \"Ghosts I-IV\" be the soundtrack...\n\nAnd as the mood of the album changes, allow your mood to flow with the album...try to get lost in the music.\n\nSome have commented that \"Ghosts I-IV\" sounds similar in style to the instrumental music from \"The Fragile,\" (1999) but I don't know if it's all that accurate to say that. While the instrumental music from \"the Fragile\" sort of held the vocal compositions from that CD together like glue, \"Ghosts I-IV\" is a little more \"out there.\" It can, therefore, be seen as a mosaic--of several different styles--piano compositions, industrial beats, the avant-garde--all mixed together, with no real dominant flavor overpowering the rest. And while the album is all-over-the-place, treading many territories, everything works; \"Ghosts I-IV\" takes so many twists-and-turns-its always interesting. At the same time, with almost two hours of music to absorb, \"Ghosts I-IV\" is best appreciated with repeated listens--to fully appreciate all its' rich textures and intricacy.","classification":4,"fold":8}

It paints a picture of some people in the south playing their music and enjoying it. These fictional musicians, the sultans, didn't need to categorize their style.

From his second release \"12 Play\" onward, as an artist R. Kelly has confounded and sometimes aggravated me deeply. On the one hand there's that Bump-&-Grind, Thug Playah persona, which appeals to most R&B fans who came of age in the 90's and then there's that persona that can craft a gospel-tinged tune like \"I Believe I Can Fly\", a club bouncer like \"Home Alone\", steppers classics like \"Step In The Name Of Love\" & \"Happy People\", or classic old-school flavored songs like \"When A Woman's Fed Up\", or a contemporary \"begging\" anthem such as \"I Can't Sleep\". As an artist he didn't appear so much as versatile, but a musically schizophrenic shill pandering to the buck. For example, Prince, before his Jehovah's Witness conversion, could seemly transition from a licentiously dark sex freak to a metaphysical musical wonder and you could still sense the Prince's integrity and commitment to musical craft. the worse you could expect from Prince is him going off on some abstract tangent that nobody but Prince could comprehend. Up until lately, you often had to wonder just how low R. Kelly would sink, before he'd crank out another anthemic song in an effort to convince you he wasn't the child-stalking pedophile his court cases insinuated he was.\n\nNo doubt, the man has an almost unparalleled sense of hip-hop\/pop craftsmanship and what will sell. But his music ... from TP2.com forward seemed to be just a little too calculated for my tastes. The contradicting irony is that I either have entire CDs or tunes from every release he's done up until Double-Up. And while most people would crown him the \"King of R&B\", I won't ... despite his obvious sales and track record. I will concede that his influence on 90's and first decade 2000's R&B is undeniable. I admit that having been weaned on the real masters of R&B: Marvin, Smokey, Sam Cooke, Luther, Peabo and groups Like the O'Jays, The Tempts, The Stylistics, The Spinners, The Dramatics ... people with a level of elegance, sincerity and class. R. Kelly and his hip-hop infused, thug-flavored  brand of R&B seemed to be the antithesis of what I consider REAL R&B was all about. In the 90's, it was as if any male R&B singer who wasn't singing in an R. Kelly vein, he was considered \"soft\" and unmarketable. And in truth, with a few exceptions, most of R. Kelly's \"soft\" contemporaries during that period ... with a few notable exceptions (Joe, Gerald Levert, Keith Sweat, Usher) ... their careers floundered and they disappeared from the scene.\n\nToo many times R. Kelly ... IMO ... appeared more concerned about commercial sales than any heartfelt commitment to high-quality musical content. Even though R. Kelly had some admittedly memorable and enjoyable stellar departures from his standard modus operandi of gangsta-seasoned bedroom music. But to me they were finely crafted, million-selling hiccups. From where I sit, the whole \"neo-soul\" trend producing Musiq Soulchild, Maxwell, and Raheem Devaughn was a direct retort to the salacious Bump-&-Grind, Sex-Me road of \"Rubbish & Bullcrap\" R. Kelly and his clones had steered the genre down and almost killed it. And all of that flack with his sex crime charges certainly didn't endear me to his music. By the time \"Double-Up\" came out, I declared I was done with R. Kelly. It seemed like all he was capable of producing were thug anthems fit for strip clubs. Kicking Ne-Yo out of his tour back in 2008 really ticked me off ... I was done with the \"Peed Piper of R&B\". When his \"Untitled\" released came out 2 years ago, I listened to the \"Religious\" cut with amused contempt; typical calculating R. Kelly single!\n\nBut at this point in my long-winded polemic (seemingly) hating on R. Kelly, I have to say that \"Love Letter\" is a release truly deserving the 4-star rating I'm giving it. The obvious calculated decision to hearken back to and pay homage to 60's & 70's soul is why I'm stingy with that 5th star. I have plenty of 4 & 5-star rated R. Kelly singles in my music collection, but as far as whole CDs, only his first four releases (\"Born Into The 90's, R., & R. Kelly\") were worthy of a rating from me higher than 3 stars.\n\n\"Love Letter\" is probably the first R. Kelly release I can say I like without qualifying it. It's also the first R. Kelly release in a long time that I don't have to wince at if my teenaged daughter were have it on her mp3 player. The title cut and \"Love Letter Christmas\" radiate with authentic sincerity. I have only 3 criticisms of this CD. #1. The cut \"When A Woman Loves\" though good as a \"testifying\" tribute to a woman's devotion, does sound a bit contrived. Anybody old enough to have heard Gene Chandler's live version of his 1965 cut \"Rainbow\" or Marvin Gayes' 1974 live version of \"Distant Lover\" will know what I'm talking about. Those R&B icons practiced a level of on-stage authentic testifying and begging R. Kelly has yet to achieve ... athough ... R. puts out a great vocal facsimile of their intensity. #2. If I didn't know better, I'd almost swear R. Kelly looked at\/listened to Raphael Saadiq's 2008 release \"The Way I See It\" and said \"hmmm ... that's what I'll do next... a retro-release!\" And while Raphael Saadiq's \"The Way I See It\" sounds more organic and true to the period it pays homage to, \"Love Letter\" oozes with R. Kelly's slick studio production technique, though still evoking the era in a very admirable fashion.\n\nThanks to \"Love Letter\", I'm (temporarily) suspending my epithets of \"The Peed Piper of Rubbish & Bullcrap\" where R. Kelly is concerned. That is ... until he pi$$e$ me off with another set of thug-nificent ghetto anthems. I sincerely hope R. Kelly continues with this level of artistry.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Mott the Hoople was one of the most interesting British glam-rock bands of the 1970's. They started their recording career with Island Records as a progressive rock band. They released 4 fine ( though uneven ) records for Island during 1969-72, before they changed for CBS. This change combined with  David Bowie producing his own \"All the Young Dudes\" for them gave the big breakthrough and a new profile as the rock'n rollers of glam rock.\n\nThis 2 CD collection concentrates on their CBS period, though each of their 4 Island albums are represented by one track. These 4 tracks are all good songs in their own right, but can obviously not cover the great variety of their output during that period. So go for other compilations \/ or the originals ( now with bonus-tracks ) if you want to research their early days.\n\nDavid Bowie produced their first album \"All the Young Dudes\", and his touch his very apparent through-out the album. The sound is close to his own on albums like \"Hunky Dory\", \"Ziggy Stardust\" or \"Alladin Sane\". Only two track has been left out from that album, which along with the follow-up \"Mott\" was their most consistent record. Their song-writing matured during that period, and although the band was uncertain whether they would be able cope with Bowie's skill, when the recording's of \"Mott\" began, that self-produced album shows the band at the peak of their creativity. Only one track is missing from the album. Outstanding tracks from the album are the rockers \"All the Way From Memphis\" and \"Honaloochie Boogie\" along with the great ballads \"\"I Wish I Was Your Mother\", \"Ballad of Mott the Hoople\" and \"Hymn for the Dudes\".\n\nUnfortunately guitarist and songwriter Mick Ralphs was growing frustrated with Ian Hunter taking more and more of the spotlight, and he left soon after the release of \"Mott\". Spooky Tooth guitarist Luther Grosvenor ( Ariel Bender ) was recruited to take his place, but things never become the same again.\n\nTheir final studio album, the slightly chaotic and spotty \"The Hoople\", did contain some fine tracks and was a commercial succes, containing the two hit-singles \"The Golden Age of Rock'n Roll\" and \"Roll Away the Stone\"; but the spark had gone, and they spilt up in 1974.\n\nBesides their albums the band recorded some fine singles-only tracks; all of which are included here. Hunter's ballad \"Rose\" is outstanding and it also became a live-favourite. The late B-side \"Rest in Peace\" is another song in the same category - great song!\n\nThe two 1974 A-sides \"Foxy Foxy\" and \"Saturday Gigs\" are also great; especially the autobiografical ballad \"Saturday Gigs\" is outstanding. This was one of the very last recordings they did, featuring guitarist Mick Ronson. A little sad they did split up after that, because the recording shows that this new line-up had the potential of creating new exciting material. On the other hand \"Saturday Gigs\" is a worthy final note to the career of a great band.\n\nGreat informative booklet!! Recommended!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Iggy Azalea is the latest thing to come into the hip hop world and frankly it would have been just fine without her. Her debut album \"The New Classic\" is an exhausting 51 minutes through a wanna be rapper's attempt at breaking into the mainstream. To an extent, it worked, but she comes off as annoying and it's obvious she's trying way too hard to fit into the rap game.\nLet's take a look at the singles. \"Work\" was the lead single off of the album and was nothing more than atrocious. An absolutely ridiculous (not to mention annoying) beat doesn't work well with the \"started from the bottom\" lyrics that has become so popular in rap as of late. The lyrics range from relatable to absolutely nonsensical in about three seconds flat as we go from \"16 in the middle of Miami, no money no family\" directly to \"I've been up all night, tryin to get that riiicchhh, i've been work work work work working on my S#!+\" Just awful.\n\"Change Your Life\" doesn't bode much better though it does have a decent feature from T.I. The song had potential for a catchy hook but flops thanks to an unoriginal lyrical half of the hook. The beat is the worst part as Iggy struggles to stay on top of it for pretty much the entire duration of the song thanks to lazy production values that left nearly nothing to be desired of them.\nThen we have \"Fancy\" arguably the catchiest of the bunch and without a doubt the one single that Iggy will more than likely only be known for, for the rest of her career. The entire song features nothing but a few notes on what seems to be a guitar that somebody clamped the strings down to, it sounds like a DJ Mustard wanna be beat which is the worst kind of wanna be there is. The fact that they were able to pull a catchy song out of it is absolutely baffling. Most of that is thanks to Charli XCX who lays down a fancy hook with a stereotypical bridge. The song loses any and all steam it has two minutes into it leaving us with Iggy lazily chanting her name over and over again for the last minute and a half over the awful beat. On top of all of that, the lyrics are downright awful ranging from nonsense to \"what the hell did she just say?\": \"Swagger on super, I can't shop at no department\nBetter get my money on time, if they not money, decline\". WHAT? Where to even start on that is a seemingly overwhelming feat in and of itself.\nAs for the rest of the album we're left with a mix of songs that are just trying and failing to be replications of the singles. Most of the tracks here are ridiculous over the top pop tracks that she attempts to rap to. \"Black Widow\" and \"Goddess\" are two tracks that are extremely guilty of this. Again, awful lyrics more idiotic production and you've got yourself an album that belongs in the garbage can.\n\"The New Classic\" isn't bad. It's really bad. With almost every track trying to be a top 40 hit, it's exhausting just to try to sit through it, and the fact that none of the 15 tracks here can even start to make sense lyrically is just a slap in the face. If you decide to sit through this atrocity just be aware that the moments when it does shine is not a worthy pay off of the rest of the album.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 3\/10\n\nPros:\n+ Catchy beats here and there\n\nCons:\n- Downright awful lyrics\n- Bad production values\n- Every song is trying to be a top 40 hit","classification":2,"fold":8}

{"text":"Content for several years with being in the background while the often fiery and feisty Natalie Maines was their lead vocalist, sisters Emily Robison and Martie Maguire, having achieved a lot with Natalie as the Dixie Chicks, decided to do their own musical side project under a different moniker while Natalie decided to take time off from music following the Chicks' Grammy wins in 2007, and the controversies over Nat's Bushwhacking comments in London during the previous four years.  So here Emily and Martie come into the mix as the Court Yard Hounds.  And although it may be missing the intensity and the snarl that Nat bought to the Chicks, there is just as much bite as there is bark in these Hounds.\n\nFor one thing, having really grown well beyond what the Nashville or even mainstream Texas establishments pegged them as with the Chicks' TAKING THE LONG WAY, Emily and Martie have carried that album's songwriting style over onto this duo project, where breezy songs like \"The Coast\" and \"Delight (Something New Under The Sun)\" alternate with rootsy country-rock songs like \"I Miss You\" and \"Fairytale\", and rather stinging social commentary, the latter in the form of \"Ain't No Son\", which is a fiery attack against the redneck notion that homosexuals are inferior to everybody else.  One would also be remiss in not mentioning the fact that their instrumental abilities make them rather peerless in a genre where independent women are still an anomaly, Martie doing her fine fiddle and mandolin work (and even lead vocal on her own composition \"Gracefully\"; the other songs being written by Emily, who does the lead singing on the rest of the album, and sounds, unintentionally, like Sheryl Crow), and Emily working things out on guitar, banjo, dobro and other sundry stringed instruments.  They also get able help from highly reliable session vets, like Natalie's father Lloyd Maines, ex-Lone Justice drummer Don Heffington, and pedal steel wizard Greg Leisz, who worked on the Eagles' LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEN, and Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris' 1999 \"Everly Sisters\" album WESTERN WALL: THE TUCSON SESSIONS.  And on \"See You In Spring\", Emily and Martie get it on with Bob Dylan's son Jakob as guest vocalist.\n\nCOURT YARD HOUNDS almost certainly falls into that musically gray area known as Americana, what with its mix of rock, folk, pop, country, and bluegrass elements; like TAKING THE LONG WAY, it will likely succeed with that Americana crowd as well as an audience that was raised on the 1970s California country-rock sound pioneered by Linda, Emmylou, the Eagles, and Poco.  But make no mistake, there is a huge audience out there that loves to hear something different from the same old Nashville assembly line.  And though it hardly means that the Chicks themselves are through as a group, at the very least Emily and Martie have created something of their own as a sister duo that is eminently listenable and memorable.","classification":5,"fold":8}

Nevertheless, that hasn't meant that she was a side artist.

Still, she does handle herself musically well, but I hope her next single handles much better according to myself. Hopefully, at that time Orianthi can shred her way to a higher platform.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"The eternally youthful Gwen Stefani returns with her third solo album full of songs where she openly wears her heart on her sleeve and seems to let out a lot of emotion following a tumultuous time in her life. Produced by a range of people including Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, Robin Fredriksson, Grek Kurstin, and Stefani herself, This Is What The Truth Feels Like sounds modern with lots of different song styles backed up by interesting electronic production that creates a satisfying listening experience. Gwen Stefani is singing at the top of her game here with strong powerful vocals and her uniquely quirky lyrical style. Highlights include the familiar electro dance grooves of first single \"Make Me Like You\", the organic production and emotional sentiment of \"Truth\", the epic ballad and great vocal hooks of \"Used To Love You\", and the moody slow burner \"Me Without You\". The international deluxe edition includes a mammoth five bonus tracks including the sultry vocals of \"Getting Warmer\" and the smooth production of \"Splash\" that builds to a memorable chorus. To her credit, Gwen Stefani has produced a very strong solo album that is long yet entertaining, emotional yet fun, and modern yet warm and familiar. This Is What The Truth Feels Like is a great offering to fans of this evergreen artist and no doubt shows that there is even bigger and better things ahead in her future.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"If you only know Billy Currington from \"Party For Two,\" his hit duet with Shania Twain, you need to expand your horizons and check out his 2003 self-titled debut and this latest gem, which reveal what Currington is really capable of vocally and stylistically.\n\nDOIN' SOMETHIN' RIGHT opens and closes with foot stompers (\"I Wanna Be A Hillbilly,\" \"She Knows What To Do With A Saturday Night\") which will have you dancing in the streets (or at least at your local honkytonk).  It between, we get a somewhat gentler Billy, with the title track\/lead off single providing a relaxed yet heartfelt delivery, and a lusty \"Little Bit Lonely\" plus \"Here I Am\" showcasing incredible charisma.\n\n\"Good Directions\" is the type of down home, good ol' boy number that Kenny Chesney succeeds with (again and again and again).  Billy's remake of \"Lucille\" is a nice update, hitting a little harder than Kenny Rogers' original, while a collaboration with Michael McDonald on \"She's Got A Way With Me\" offers a power ballad change of pace.\n\nHopefully, this diverse collection will elevate Billy to the next level on the country music food chain.  It's a fine effort that clearly avoids the sophomore jinx.","classification":5,"fold":8}

The Cowsills specialized in tight harmonies and began performing and recording at a very young age. The group consisted of brothers Barry, Bill, John, Bob and Paul, little sister Susan and their mom Barbara. Their meteoric rise to the top of the charts was the inspiration for the hit TV show \"The Partridge Family\". The Cowsills had three local hits in 1966 that got the attention of the folks at M-G-M records who signed the band in early 1967. Several months later The Cowsills released their first single for M-G-M called \"The Rain, The Park & Other Things\" (you might remember it as \"The Flower Girl\") which made it all the way to #2 on the Billboard charts.

{"text":"I was never a real Jewel fan, I only had Pieces Of You and I thought it was alright.  I liked her singles after that but never felt like buying her BORING cds.  This si a totally different Jewel.  Although many are critisizing her I love it.  Not a lot of anyhting in here.  There songs are more movable which is good.  Do people really want Jewel to keep making boring music and people to pretty much get sick of her.  As for all the critics... well this album debuted at #2 on Billboards album charts and is the highest position she has ever been.  Therefor she must be doing something good.  I honestly say that I love every song on this album and I never thought I would say that about Jewel.  Also her sound is very \"Shakira\"  this time around which  is interesting in a way.  She is going more rock\/dance and every artist changes their style with every album but her words and meaning in songs stay the say.  I congratualte Jewel on an album VERY well done.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I first heard of Buck Owens thru the Beatles' Act Naturally version back in 1965 or so. As time went on I began to appreciate Buck's remarkable band and talent. His records sounded so clean and featured twangy Fender guitars. His band leader, Don Rich was a model of restrained professionalism. Clean and accurate picking, not fast or flashy. Buck was an outstanding singer and his two part harmonies were his trademark. All these songs were No. 1s on the country charts and date from Act Naturally in 1963 to 1988's Streets of Bakersfield with Dwight Yoakum featuring Flaco Jiminez on accordian. WOW! What a great CD this is. There isn't a bad cut on it! If you only want one Buck Owens CD, this is the one! It's too bad most younger people only remember him as a cornfield clown on Hee-Haw, because Buck Owens was truly one of the greatest country stars in its history.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I have heard R. Kelly at his worse and I have heard him at his best. What is R. Kelly at his best, you may ask. If you really want to know, listen to two classic R&B albums by him: \"Chocolate Factory\" and this very album I am reviewing, \"Love Letter.\" After listening to these LP's, I guarantee you will be blow away as I was. He is gifted in every sense of the word. He reminds me somewhat of Prince because he writes, produces and arranges his music and he plays instruments. He and Prince have mastered the art of music. They have taken each aspect of it, studied it and mastered each aspect effortlessly.\n\n\"Love Letter\" is certainly one of those \"just press play\" records. There is no filler and these are not just songs, they are hits. Worth mentioning is the fact that these songs sound like they could have been included on Kelly's \"Happy People\" LP. The songs just sound a lot like the tracks on that album. \"When a Woman Loves\" was the first song released to radio. It was a fine choice because, if nothing else, Kelly's vocals will command your attention. The lyrics are heartfelt and honest. The lyrics are profound without being esoteric. The chorus says, \"when a woman loves, she loves for real.\" Indeed, R. Kelly, indeed. \"Number One Hit\" is another hit with replay value. What great production, smooth melody and nice lyrics. Undoubtedly, the most special moment on this LP is the last track. The song is called \"You Are Not Alone.\" Kelly had written this song for Michael Jackson and he performs it here. One can't help but to get choked up. Kelly does a fine job with his rendition.\n\nDo yourself a favor and add this to your collection. A lot of the music that is out there currently is trash that will not last beyond this season. R. Kelly easily transcends bubblegum pop and brings us real R&B. *Sigh of relief* At last.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"Number One Hit\"\n2. \"Just Can't Get Enough\"\n3. \"You Are Not Alone\"\n4. \"Love Is\"\n5. \"Love Letter\"","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"The problem with people like Prince, and with most other music legends; Stevie Wonder, Donna Summer, Al Green, Bob Dylan to mention a few, is this; some people are stuck back in the day when they were at their peak and thus nothing new they ever put out can ever be good in their opinion. If you put that aside, they are still making good music today, much better than most current artists. I certainly enjoyed Prince's last 3 CDs \"Musicology\", \"3121\", and \"Planet earth\".\n\nThis time around, Prince releases 2 CDs simultaneously, the Rockier, more guitar driven \"Lotusflow3r\", and the Funkier \"Mplsound\", showcasing two sides of the maestro. Which disc you prefer depends on what style of music you prefer. This is a review of the Prince discs only. I found the third disc (by his new protege) just ok.\n\n\"Lotusflow3r\" opens with a psychedelic sounding guitar instrumental, leading into the snarling \"Boom\". Other songs in a similar mode are \"Wall of Berlin\" and \"Dreamer\". \"The morning after\" is bouncy Pop\/Rock a la \"Raspberry beret\" or \"Cinnamon girl\". \"Colonized mind\" is a truly awesome groovy ballad with hints of Hendrix and lyrics about racism\/Political intrigue\/injustice. Definitely the standout. \"Feel good, feel better, feel wonderful\" is a slice of James Brown-slice funk, choppy and incredibly groovy. The aptly titled \"Love like jazz\" is a lilting Jazzy ballad. \"77 Beverly Park\" is a lovely instrumental with delicately plucked guitars and a smooth Jazz feel. Closing the disc is the instrumental \"...Back 2 the lotus\" which sounds like a jam session.\n\n\"Mplsound\" comprises just 9 tracks but they are generally longer than those on \"Lotusflow3r\". The disc opens with the upbeat choppy Funk \"(There'll never B) Another like me\" with blistering guitars. Highly infectious! Just as groovy is \"Dance 4 me\". \"Chocolate box\" has a Pop feel and semi-spoken lyrics, while the midtempo Funk \"Ol' skool company\" has him singing in that Camille voice over a languid groove. \"No more candy 4 U\" is bouncy Pop\/Rock with piano rather than guitar pushed to the fore. The rest of the album comprises ballads, standouts being \"Here\" (with some falsetto and a spoken bridge), \"Valentina\", and the piano ballad \"Better with time\" (and he does sound it).\n\nCertainly not his best CD, but definitely nothing to be sneezed at either. Rock solid!","classification":5,"fold":8}

Well, that is the case with a 4 year absence from the media spotlight, but their latest single isn't really a big bang as it could've been. Boom Boom Pow, the latest single from The Black Eyed Peas brings in a more techno rhythm to the funky sounds. While the song had a nice beat, it just sadly wasn't as driven as their songs from a few earlier like Don't Phunk With My Heart or My Humps showed for fans.

{"text":"Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\"; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson. We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic. Whether we are asleep with this beautiful song 'secreting' itself into our memory or 'relaxing' in our romantic, nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning, enrichment, and themes so present in this joyous, uplifting recording. \"Just send for me, oh baby.\"\n\n\"Remember the day I set you free\nI told you you could always count on me\nFrom that day on, I made a vow,\nI'll be there when you want me,\nSome way, some how.\n\n'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,\nAin't no valley low enough,\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you babe.\n\nMy love is alive\nWay down in my heart\nAlthough we are miles apart\nIf you ever need a helping hand,\nI'll be there on the double\nAs fast as I can.\nDon't you know that there\n\nAin't no mountain high enough,\nAin't no valley low enough,\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you babe.\"","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"One Republic's \"Waking Up\" contains an emotionally driven set of songs from track one to eleven plus one (the Amazon Exclusive Version contains a cover of Duffy's \"Mercy\").  The album does not skip a beat with its energetic instrumentation of pulsating rhythms that breathes into the band's initial sound as well as a tinge of influences that are undeniable from The Beatles, U2, and Coldplay.  All of the tracks are deeply intimate and intense that has a somewhat subtle theme of treading on.\n\nThe opening track \"Made For You\" contains a thumping intro and inter-play of Ryan Tredder's signature vocals and the string and chorale arrangements a la the Rolling Stones' \"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\" which is identifiable and perfectly flows into the next track \"All The Right Moves.\"  \"Moves\" along with the other singles off the album \"Secrets\" and \"Good Life\" possess a powerful musical executions and memorable choruses that pound with much exuberance from beginning to end.  The band slows the tempo with the following tracks that sound very much like Coldplay and U2 \"Fear\" and the title track \"Waking Up.\"  But beyond the comparisons, the piano ballad \"All this Time\" is simply unforgettable.\n\nIn essence, \"Waking Up\" is an album worth listening to and adding to one's play list.  With its revolving theme of longing and waiting and marching to a beat of one's own, there is sure to be several favorite songs that may prompt the listener to replay with the volume set louder than usual.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play \"Amarillo By Morning,\" and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to \"Amarillo by Morning.\"\n\nSo, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy\/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"All of Type O Negative's usual elements are still firmly in place on their seventh full-length. For example, really memorable, Sabbath-inspired guitar riffing, good solos, prominent, grumbling bass lines, Peter Steele's masculine yet limpid vocals (including a baritone that is so deep, it almost matches his bass sound), both humorous and depressing lyrics, creepy keyboards, well-written melodies, bullying grooves, gothic overtones, occasional psychedelic sounds, and solid drumming are all definitely very much apart of the band's famous arsenal.\n\nBut there is also an intangible something and feeling of greatness present on 2007's \"Dead Again,\" making it easily their finest release since 1996's iconic \"October Rust.\" For one, there should be absolutely no question as to if Type O are just phoning it in and\/or recycling old material (which was something that some fans believed to be the case on 1999's \"World Coming Down\" and 2003's \"Life Is Killing Me\"), because they now sound as inspired, energetic, and all-around strong as ever! Plus, they can't be said to exactly reinvent the genre here, but thanks to the rather broad and sophisticated songwriting on display here, these 10 songs do possess a fairly refreshing  and unpredictable quality. The album shuffles back and forth between several different moods and genres, including really heavy doom metal, sludge, thrash (thus showing-off Steele's roots in the genre, as a founding member of Carnivore), goth metal, industrial, and progressive and traditional rock. It is viscerally heavy and frequently quite fast, yet (in true T.O.N. style), it also retains a certain level of control and tunefulness throughout. Suffice it to say, this is one very rewarding, well-rounded, and epically epic piece of music. In addition, at 77 minutes in length (!), it should be more than long enough to satiate all fans' appetites for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe terrifically ominous and choir-abetted intro of the title track begins thins on a creepy note. It then segues into propulsive speed metal territory -- a rollicking groove, strong bass work throughout, and a sing-song-y chorus to add catchiness. \"Tripping A Blind Man\" works similarly: An old-school Black Sabbath-meets-Eighties thrash (i.e., say, Megadeth) piece with a neat gothic keyboard beginning before suddenly becoming almost crushing and breakneck when blazing tempos, fast guitar leads, and an exceptional solo (near the end) slam onto the scene. \"The Profits Of Doom\" falls somewhere between My Dying Bride, Crowbar, Acid Bath, Deep Purple, and Alice In Chains. It is a slow and extremely progressive, slow-burning, brooding, and trance-inducing epic which nears the eleven minute mark and has thunderous, trudging power chords that weigh a ton, a beefy bottom-end completed by noteworthy, and dirty, grungy-sounding bass lines, and vocals that trade-off between growling, eerie spoken-words, and impressive, proper singing.\n\nOn the flip side, \"September Sun\" is a very pretty, somber, textured, tranquil, and emotionally-moving Alice Cooper-esque ballad that is peppered with cool piano keys, melodic strings, and warm and powerful crooning. The lyrics are also worth mentioning here, because they are so sad and dark that it wouldn't be surprising if they leave a lump in the listener's throat. Next up, \"Halloween In Heaven\" is much catchier and more accessible than usual. Here, a memorable, driving, stoner metal-ish main riff is accented nicely by soaring, clean backing female vocals. At fourteen and-a-half-minutes long, song number six, \"These Three Things,\" takes the cake for being the set's pinnacle and is possibly the biggest highlight to be found here. It is an extremely dark, goth-y, and stormy piece based primarily on droning guitars and muscular bass work, but it also makes sure to include numerous different facets, and lots of nice subtleties, atmosphere, and mood-enhancers.\n\nTaking a break from their more experimental side, \"She Burned Me Down\" is more proof that, when they want to, Type O Negative can always kick out pure doom metal with the best of them, and is highlighted by excellent, mesmerizing riffage, emotional vocals, and a fiery and winding guitar solo. \"Some Stupid Tomorrow\" again takes things into an up-tempo pace; in fact, one could argue it sounds kind of like a Motorhead tune. It is centered around storming (and sometimes almost punk-y) drumming (including a few bass kicks), call-and-response choruses, and a steadfastly meaty and sludgy bass bottom. The curiously entitled \"An Ode To Locksmiths\" boasts a leather-clad rock `n' roll vibe, tasty, crunchy, lumbering guitars, and Ozzy Osbourne-inspired singing. Finally, the closing \"Hail And Farewell To Britain\" once again downshifts into depressive doom territory, with a bass-heavy mix, big, fat, chugging guitar riffs, lock-step-unison rhythms, and a great keyboard solo.\n\nCutting to the chase, \"Dead Again\" is, quite simply, one very amazing album, and an essential listen. And it is the sound of a band that is easily firing on all cylinders; hence, contrary to its misleading title, it is also proof that this band has never sounded more alive\/lively. However, in an oh-so-cruel twist-of-fate, Peter Steele passed away from heart failure in April 2010, at the age of 48. But even if we are faced with the sad truth that we will now never again hear anything new from T.O.N., at least fans can take solace in the fact that the frontman lead a remarkable career, and unquestionably went out on the absolute top.\n\nR.I.P. Peter, you will be missed.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"The problem I have with Stefani's music is that it's like candy--sweet and sickly at the same time. Ultimately, her music leaves you with a sugar crash afterward. I have all three of her solo cds, plus all of No Doubt's cds. I didn't enjoy the last No Doubt cd either.\n\n\"This Is What The Truth Feels Like...\" is Stefani's first solo work in 10 years. This is probably the best of the three solo albums. It is certainly her most mature. Most of the irritating idiosyncrasies from her first two cds are scrubbed out here to good results. The only clunker here is \"Naughty\" which just comes off as so amateurish for a 46 year old woman.\n\nThere's much to like here, and there should be hit singles all around, but things have changed in the past 10 years, and Stefani also passed that popular music death mark--age 40. I notice that none of her past four singles released between 2014 and now have cracked the Top 40. This is a shame, because I'd rather listen to Stefani than Gomez, Lorde, Azalea, Lovato, Jepsen, and a whole host of other young ladies.\n\nI give \"This Is What The Truth Feels Like...\" three and a half stars because it's good, but not quite four stars. There's always a sort of over-produced quality to Stefani's music that strips it of having real emotional impact and resonance. She can't create an album without at least eight different producers on it, which gives all of her albums an uneven quality to them.\n\n\"Misery\", \"You're My Favorite\", \"Make Me Like You\", \"Truth\", and \"Used To Love You\" are the best tracks here, and the most likely candidates for a Top 40 hit.\n\nBring on the next No Doubt album. Here's how \"This Is What The Truth Feels Like...\" compares to Stefani's other work:\n\n2004 Love. Angel. Music.

{"text":"Jim James and his Kentucky veterans \"My Morning Jacket\" are back for their seventh album after a four-year break. \"The Waterfall\" sees the band throw in the kitchen sink and other accouterments on this new record. There are traces of alt-country, power pop, soul and some psychedelic indie rock to boot. It also stretches out over a deluxe version comprising four extra tracks all nicely performed.\n\nThe album kicks off with the ultra positive \"Believe (Nobody knows)\" where it is clear that Jim James is in fine voice as he drives the song forward with a huge vocal. Much more interesting however is the second song \"Compound Fracture\" a soulful track that seems to be infused with the spirit of Hall & Oates, no bad thing in this reviewers book. It is followed by the gentle acoustics of \"Like a River\" which is one of those classic meditative tracks which James has always thrown into each MMJ release. The single \"Big Decisions\" is good old fashioned classic rock although the song is completely eclipsed by \"Only Memories Remain\" a seven minute plus wonder which would have happily fit on a Marvin Gaye album. This soulful edge to the band is, of course, a feature of their live shows where they regularly throw in covers ranging from \"Careless Whisper\" to \"Hungry Heart\". It is the sign of a band not afraid to acknowledge their influences and treat audiences with a veritable jukebox of back catalogue classics and surprising songs drawn from across the gamut of pop music. This reviewer is, however, most content when James slips the band dynamics and unleashes an acoustic beauty like the wondrous \"Get the Point\" this album's match for earlier joys of tracks like \"The Librarian\".\n\nAs with all MMJ albums, a number of songs don't quite make the grade. The title track \"In its infancy (The Waterfall)\" takes ages to get going and when it does it is rather repetitive; the same is true of \"Tropics (Erase Traces\" although this is a better-constructed song. So there, you have it, \"The Waterfall\" confirms that this Kentucky band continue to defy genres and yet produce music that is cohesive and a joy to explore. This is a sterling effort by a great Amercian band who following previous experience will now probably shoot off in all directions to pursue solo projects. Let us hope that it doesn't take four years for them again to return to the studio.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"This past year has already been one of the saddest all over the world. No further is meant and said by the tragic and horrible death of Whitney Houston. Her impact on music has definitely been the most influential and prestigious by all female singers of the past 30 years, as the most-awarded female artist of all time in Guiness Book Of World Records with over 400 awards around the world. Back in 2001 Whitney already found her sparkle when it was tapped that the late singer Aalyiah was tapped to play what Jordin Sparks wound up portraying in Sparkle. I honestly promised to myself I would see the film the opening day even before Whitney passed, and Ms. Houston's role was remarkable and hard. But the music all in all that Jordin and the others had to follow was not all to shimmer.\n\nThe soundtrack to Sparkle, brings in music that mirrors in some cracks from the original soundtrack that Whitney's godmother did, Aretha Franklin. The songs that Jordin, Carmen and others do are not as good as what Aretha Franklin, Curtis Mayfield and other left their mark in music showed. The covers from Giving Him Something He Can Feel and Look Into Your Heart are not as driven  from Jordin, Carmen and others in the film, nor the soundtrack that shines. It is honestly Whitney's presence that takes the spotlight completely, with her song His Eye On The Sparrow that blew me away, especially in life and loss from the definitive voice. It is definitely the only moment on the film soundtrack that is worth listening too, considering how much Whitney grew up watching the original Sparkle as a child, that drove her distinctively. The new song Celebrate which Whitney did with Jordin is also impressive, and a sign of what the two could've been in music together, as the only other drive on the album.\n\nAll in all, what did I think of the music for Sparkle? I thought of it as a poignant and elegant farewell to one of the most definitive women of all time, whom showed voice that came from the heart, Whitney Houston. I am so glad she made the film before she dimmed into the sunset, as one last reminder of what a voice and one of the most definitive every-women can do. Not as a joke, but as a beautiful swan can do. If you are a die hard Whitney Houston fan, and a fan of Jordin Sparks, you'll definitely want to buy the soundtrack, but otherwise I suggest watching the film and then judge if it sparkles enough for you.\n\nWhitney Houston 1963-2012: Bless your sweet voice and your beautiful sparrow\n\nAlbum Cover: B\n\nSongs: C\n\nPrice: C\n\nMastering: B\n\nOverall: C+","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"These versions of many blues and soul standards are all fine, there are a couple of Freddie penned trax as well.  I've read the quibbles in the All Music Guide and thru out the Freddie King reviwes listed below, but I still really like this music.  Yes Leon's destinctive piano often sits on top of the mix, and the strings and backing female voices occationaly over power King's playing and mar and date the arrangements, but it's soooo good, even if it is at the end of the road for Freddie.\n.\nI'd suggest picking up the 2-disc \"KING OF THE BLUES\".\nThat CD contains all of these cuts and then some; about 60 in all, in a generous package.  There are only a handful of songs that are not up to par and some that are so good you will wonder why you did not already have King in your blues collection.

And it goes on to say when we stand together, it is our finest hour--we can do anything we set our minds to do because it is love that gives us power.\n\nThis song is so inspiring to me and gives me hope and joy when I listen to it.

{"text":"Now THIS is how you make a great pop album.\n\nChristina Aguilera's \"Lotus\" has all the makings of a great pop masterpiece: stunning vocals, tight songwriting (in which Aguilera co-wrote nearly all of the songs), and a few potentially monster hit singles mixed in with some great album tracks and practically zero filler.\n\nOn past albums, Aguilera kind of always suffered an identity crisis, as she could not seem to decide what she wanted to do with her amazing voice. The problem was not that she had a lack of good material to sing (except for \"Back To Basics,\" in which that was the case for the most part). It was that she simply could not decide which direction she wanted to go. Never was this more evident than on her past studio effort, \"Bionic,\" which had some tremendous individual moments, but was largely an uneven album and certainly a commercial failure.\n\nBut with \"Lotus,\" she is content with the fact that she is making a sleek pop album, with state of the art production and some hot featured artists. \"Army of Me\" is a powerful track and a grower. \"Red Hot Kinda Love\" is her best pop song since the days of \"Genie\" and \"Beautiful.\" The Cee-lo Green contribution \"Make the World Move\" is a potential smash hit. And the smoldering ballad \"Blank Page\" reminds us all of who has the best voice on the planet.\n\nShe still has the problem of overstating things and expressing misplaced anger (much like her vastly overrated contemporary Pink), and that can be heard on the track \"Circles,\" which is kind of an odd song for an extremely wealthy and successful mother who is in her 30's to be recording. But she makes up for it in the deluxe bonus tracks, as the song \"Light Up The Sky\" is breathtaking. So overall, this is a highly successful comeback, and sure to be a huge hit. The deluxe edition is worth every penny for the extra tracks.","classification":5,"fold":8}

Tracks like the intro, \"Sing For Me\", \"Best Of Me\", \"Just A Fool\" with Blake Shelton, \"Empty Words\", Let There Be Love and maybe \"Light Up The Sky\" make you want to own them. These are my favorites. Some of the other tracks are OK but nothing essential in my mind. The worst offender here is definitely \"Shut Up\" which even the title indicates that the song will likely be childish (it is).\n\nOverall, I'd aim for the standard version. It's cheaper and you aren't missing out on much if you skip the deluxe.\n\n3.5 stars. ","classification":3,"fold":8}

The lyrics are charged and sometimes difficult to keep up with if you don't have them written-out in front of you, but that doesn't really hurt the overall value of the song.

{"text":"Willie Nile is clearly possessed by the spirit of rock `n' roll. Three albums into a renaissance that began with 2006's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Streets-of-New-York\/dp\/B000E6EJAM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Streets of New York<\/a>, the sixty-three-year-old singer-songwriter continues to turn out arrestingly good music. At an age that most rockers have retired, resigned themselves to oldies shows or simply turned into lesser versions of their younger selves, Nile is enriching his work with age and experience. His voice remains charged with idealistic belief, and he propels his tight band forward as he unleashes anthems, pop songs and powerful ballads.\n\nHis latest album opens at full throttle with \"Singin' Bell,\" the drums racing, the rhythm guitars building a wall of energy and Nile singing out like a twenty-first century Woody Guthrie. His populist mission is clear when he sings \"I'm a soldier marchin' in an army \/ Got no gun to shoot \/ But what I got is one guitar.\" It's a theme he develops through lyrics that gather the tribe and speak for unempowered. He lauds the decency of the commoner and shows pity for the insulated rich, he sings moaning Dylan-esque folk on \"Sideways Beautiful,\" tips his hat to Buddy Holly for \"My Little Girl\" and rouses the spirits of 1977 punk with \"Can't Stay Home.\"\n\nThe album's last song, a mid-tempo tune that suggests early Tom Petty, opens with the lyric \"If memory were money, I would spend every penny thinking of her.\" It's a clever turn of phrase (as is the follow-up \"If fire was her daughter, I would drink a pail of water just to kiss her\"), but like most of Nile's lyrics, it's something more - it's a memorable expression of a deeply felt emotion that's turned into a shared with the listener. Shared experience is a hallmark of Nile's songwriting, and the reason his fans remain so passionate thirty years after he debuted. This album was originally released in the UK in 2010, but is just now getting the stateside push it deserves. [2011 hyperbolium dot com]","classification":4,"fold":8}

Still except for their dreadful 09 album which I don't remember the title of, I've typically managed to find a handful of songs on each album that I enjoy, some quite a lot.  I actually quite enjoyed their 2012 release, again don't remember the name of it.  But this garbage?\n\nthis whole album sounds like a modern Disciple album without the Jesus lyrics, and I'm not exaggerating.  From the moment I heard the first song I thought \"Disciple called.  They want their music back\".  But what can I expect froma  band who ripped themselves off on the awful 09 release, remaking \"I devise my own demise\" forget the name of the horrific carbon copy track but that was the original song's title.  There's no edge at all to the music.  It's so generic it'll make your ears bleed.  Like I said going into an album by this band you have to expect a certain level of this, but geez this is too much.  We get silly rapping, bad electronic bits and guest rappers ruining what could have been a mildly tolerable song.\n\nAnd most of these 5 star reviews must be put out by the band  I mean seriously I can't imagine people honestly believing this is amongst the best albums of all time.  Where are the voices of reason?  The 2-4 star reviews.  Hell the 1 star review before mine was obviously a troll.  I at least like some of this band's past work.  I mean I can honestly believe people out there like this, but a perfect score at such a rate?  Not even close.  This is no Dark side of the moon.  No Led Zeppelin 4.  No White Album.  Hell it's not even Ten.  It's just a silly band trying to stay relevant by creating an album to appeal to teenagers.  If not for the awful work Billy Corgan has been doing since re-creating the Pumpkins I'd say this is the worst album I've heard in the past decade.\n\nAnd I forgot to mention, oh the lyrical cliches.

That just isn't the case with Chicago, and their great music collections, because they definitely hit the nail of the head very, very well. Their music has endured extraordinarily well for over thirty-five years. There have been a few successful hits collections that really reflects Chicago, and this one is just no acception.\n\nChicago's 2005 Love Songs collection, consists of their most well recieved love songs from thier long-time career. The album conists of 18 tracks, and a couple of live rendidtions of classics never before released on any Chicago album as well. The collection contains a lot of great tracks inclding You're The Inspiration, Will You Still Love Me, Beginnings, as well as classics like Colour My World Hard Habit To Break, and Hard To Say I'm Sorry. The album also includes a couple of live recording with Phillip Bailey from Earth, Wind & Fire fame, on versions of If You Leave Me Now, and the Earth, Wind & Fire classic, After The Love Is Gone, which really sounds delightful and lively.\n\nWhile there love songs albums that really don't sell very well, or just miss out on a lot of great songs, Chicago's Love Songs really displays very, very well within not just its price, but the vast number of classic Chicago tracks here. While many not at all be interested in this collection, it really is a good reflection of Chicago's best ballads.\n\nAlbum Cover: B+\n\nSongs: B+\n\nPrice: A-\n\nRemastering: A-\n\nOverall: B+","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"I've been a fan of Tyrese since 1998 and his self-titled debut. His first album contained what should have been the essential DNA for all his subsequent work. Tyrese is a legitimate R&B product of the late 90's with bonafide vocal talent that should have made him an A-List artist. But because of the industry's obsession with thug rappers, Tyrese's second album onward tended to focus on him being a muscled, shirtless, moderately thuggish singer who occasionly crooned a ballad here & there.\n\nHis forays into acting, relationship book writing and reality TV have certainly distracted him from the high-quality musical career he could have had. His R&B supergroup TGT, IMO, while moderately successful was another distraction.\n\nWith this single, SHAME, Tyrese gives the beleaguered R&B genre a welcome respite from industry-anointed white falsetto voiced standard-bearers ... ala ... Sam Smith, Robin Thicke & Justin Timberlake.  As much as I'm a fan of the aforementioned, its singing like what Tyrese puts down in this single that is the essence of what true R&B is all about!!!\n\nTHIS IS GROWN-MAN BEGGING AT IT'S FINEST!!! This ain't another routine by-the-numbers wanna-sex-you-up enticement nor another rap-glazed club banger!!! This is a song where Tyrese puts his whole heart out there ... pleading emotionally for forgiveness in a way these young shirtless tattooed R&B wannabe lover-men think is a violation of their man-code.\n\nThis is the kind of singing makes us grown folks wanna think about putting Tyrese in the same stellar company of the greats who came before him (Marvin Gaye, Teddy Pendergrass, Keith Sweat & the like!)\n\nHere's hoping Tyrese fashions the rest of his musical career in the same stylistic vein of this song!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Sure, Toronto, Ontario's Anvil may have formed like a million years ago -- all the way back in the late Seventies. But they sure as heck still have plenty of life and spark left in them. There's plenty of hiss and vinegar involved in their music (and albums like their thirteenth full-length studio release, 2009's aptly-entitled \"This Is Thirteen.\") Plus, this also means that their sound may sound a little bit dated to the uneducated metalhead. But even if it is a familiar thrash\/speed metal mash-up, bare in mind that Anvil came before -- and, thus, were a big influence on -- bands like Metallica, Testament, Anthrax, Voivod, etc. So even if every stooge that has formed since 1978 sounds like them, it doesn't friggin' matter because these guys were the original! And man, oh man, can Anvil still shred as mightily as ever -- their riffing remains rock solid and musclebound, their leads tight and precise, and their solos positively excellent throughout these thirteen cuts.\n\n\"This Is Thirteen\" gets underway with the ominously crunching, churning guitar licks and Bruce Dickinson-influenced vocals of the title track before eventually morphing into an epic, unorthodox solo section. The album really gets its ball moving, though, with the ensuing \"Bombs Away,\" as it is a truly blistering thrash-fest with propulsive chainsaw riffing and shredding solos. (So when frontman \"Lips\" proudly proclaims the titular phrase -- \"bombs away!\" -- in this song, it seems ever-so fitting.) \"Burning Bridges\" returns the record to its Iron Maiden-worshipping roots, though, as it boasts a catchy, galloping beat threaded by a strong bass line and really deft and thumping drum fills. Some more excellent and fairly wailing solo work goes along with it, too. \"Ready To Fight\" also wears its influences on its sleeve, but is clearly looks to other, different bands for inspiration. Indeed, with its steady bass lines, undeniable speed punk tinges, brisk double bass thudding, and memorable vocals, plays like a vintage Motorhead classic. And it also has some more exceptional soloing, to boot. And skipping ahead a few tracks, \"Feed The Greed\" is another very catchy and Motorhead-esque number, and one whose excellence is furthered by its fiery, twiddly guitar solo runs. Other highlights include the epically anthemic, soaring vocals in \"Flying Blind\"; \"Big Business,\" which is an insanely hooky, mid-tempo chugger that reminds of Megadeth's \"Sweating Bullets\"; \"American Refugee,\" another chunky, chug-happy number with still more ripping solos; and \"Should 'a Would 'a Could `a\" and \"Game Over,\" both of which are positively blistering inclusions, are both backed by fiery, chunked-up, belligerent riffing, and more unforgettably catchy choruses.\n\nAnvil might not exactly be set out to engrave a piece of thrash\/speed metal wheel reinvention into the minds of listeners. But as far as being a very enjoyable, original, frills-free blast of pure energy with musical chops galore, they do not at all disappoint. Sure, there might be a couple of tracks too many on \"This Is Thirteen,\" a thirteen-track, and nearly-hour-long set. But which songs should have been scrapped? Um...I'll leave that up to you to figure out.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Are you worn?  Then, this song is for you!  This song reaches the very heart of tribulation---hoping in the Lord, against all odds.  To be so low in spirit, means to yearn for the Rock that is higher---our Lord Jesus Christ, who is strong, when we are weak.  The singer beautifully captures this yearning feeling, with an ideal, cry-like tone.  As such, it is very effective at reaching the very soul of the lowly one, the one undergoing such trials.\n\n[SIDE NOTE: The Lord delivered this sinner from the trials of tribulation; He is mighty, true, and merciful.  If one were to repent and come to Him wholeheartedly, the Lord would both strengthen and deliver.  He gradually restores.  So let hope prevail, even when winning seems impossible.  For with God, all things are possible!  We who believe Jesus, believe with faith even when broken, even when things don't make sense to us.  And we glorify Him, in so doing.  For thus said the Lord to me...\"call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me. --(Psalm 50:15)]","classification":5,"fold":8}

Her latest single from her album Talk That Talk, You Da One is absolutely poor. She really doesn't have the strike in her voice that she once had awhile ago. I honestly think Rihanna needs to definitely take a very long break from singing and find herself as a growing woman all over again.

Few will deny that he is the father-in-style to several popular male vocalists over the past decade. When I first heard the lead single \"When a Woman Loves\" and heard about the concept of this album, I was under the impression that it would have an entire \"50's feel\", somewhat like Raphael Saadiq's album \"The Way I see It.\" Upon listing to this CD, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the majority of the tracks are contemporary songs, reminding me somewhat in composition of the essence R. Kelly captured on his Happy People disc. The only difference here is many of the songs are slower pace. As for the three or four 50's-feeling songs, R. Kelly simply mastered the genre as only he can. My favorite song thus far is \"Just Can't Get Enough\" which is good way to sum up this release. I highly recommend the deluxe version with the four bonus tracks.","classification":5,"fold":8}

Some songs are more industrial and faster similar to other NIN songs. Some of them are also slower, more unique and atmospheric. Trent Reznor makes every album original and they all sound different, some more than others. Ghosts and Broken are almost 100% different. I don't understand why somone would give this a 1 star review. It kept my interest and I was amazed by it.","classification":5,"fold":8}

Sister Nancy sings in a thick Jamaican patois, and her vocals are heavily treated, so I have included a link to the lyrics.

{"text":"Cyndi Lauper became one of the most well-known singers of the 80's.  If it weren't for Madonna she would have become huge.  Lauper's original style will evoke memories of the 80's for those living in that era.  These songs have a classic and magical style to them that gets better with each listen.  Lauper's vocals are not for everyone.  For some they may be irritating but for others comforting.  Her powerful vocal range makes Madonna's vocals pale in comparison.  She can sing ballads as well as up-tempo 80's pop songs.  Co-writing every song on this album she proves to the public that she is a respected artist for the most part.  In 2008 she released a new album called \"Bring Ya To The Brink\" which is the style of dance-pop.","classification":5,"fold":8}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Hornsby's music from the beginning with \"The Way It Is\" back in 1986. I saw him live at Fiddler's Green in Denver, Colorado in August 1988 for the \"Scenes From the Southside\" tour. He was fantastic.\n\nHornsby has dealt with the Best New Artist Grammy curse well. While he isn't as popular as he was 1986-1990, he has maintained his artistic integrity, earning the respect of die-hard fans. Unlike Elton John (who I like), Hornsby hasn't cranked out schlock. Unlike Billy Joel (who I also like), Hornsby has kept going. To me, Hornsby is the best piano player in popular music, period.\n\nSo here is \"Rehab Reunion\", Hornsby's first album in seven years, since 2009's \"Levitate\". This time he dispenses with technology, avoids the piano altogether, and pretty much goes acoustic throughout. This radical approach serves him well. In fact, if labels were tossed around you could call \"Rehab Reunion\" 'Americana' sounding.\n\nHornsby has retained his humor with \"Tipping\" and \"TSA Man\", his intellectual noodlings \"Hey Franz Kafka\", and his ability to tell stories \"Over the Rise\", \"Soon Enough\", \"M.I.A. in M.I.A.M.I.\", \"Rehab Reunion\", \"Tropical Cashmere Sweater\" and \"Celestial Railroad\". To me, a new version of \"The Valley Road\" could have been left off in favor of the bonus track only found on iTunes. \"The Valley Road\" is completely re-imagined, and to be honest, I still prefer the original version on \"Scenes From the Southside\".\n\n\"Rehab Reunion\" has an uplifting, playful spirit about it. Something new. It has an organic feel that hasn't been present since 1990's \"A Night on the Town\" album. It's refreshing and invigorating. Now I just wonder if it will be another seven years before we get another Hornsby album (much too long!)\n\nHere's how \"Rehab Reunion\" compares to Hornsby's other works:\n\n1986 The Way It Is: Four Stars\n1988 Scenes From the Southside: Four Stars\n1990 A Night on the Town: Four Stars\n1993 Harbor Lights: Five Stars\n1995 Hot House: Four Stars\n1998 Spirit Trail: Five Stars\n2002 Big Swing Face: Three and a Half Stars\n2004 Halcyon Days: Five Stars\n2007 Ricky Skaggs & Bruce Hornsby: Three and a Half Stars\n2007 Camp Meeting: Three Stars\n2009 Levitate: Three and a Half Stars\n2016 Rehab Reunion: Four Stars","classification":4,"fold":8}

This is a very good album.\n\nIt has some great electric blues tracks and some top notch acoustic blues numbers, along with several songs that wouldn't be out of place on some of those classic Ten Years After albums from the early 1970s. There's also un updated version of Love Like A Man, originally from the Ten Years After period.\n\nAlvin Lee's voice has held up well forty years after Ten Years After and his guitar playing will still be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with his Ten Years After material.\n\nHopefully this will bring Alvin Lee a new generation of listeners along with all of us who remember listening to him back in the early 1970s.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n7 March 2013 Update To Original Review - Just heard that Alvin Lee died today, aged 68, following \"complications from routine surgery.\" So this turns out to be his last album released during his lifetime.

{"text":"Having never been a really big fan of the Dixie Chicks, I only picked up 2006's TAKING THE LONG WAY for two reasons...first, I thought the pairing of the group with producer Rick Rubin was an interesting one. Second, I felt I needed to support a group who took SO much heat (I mean, c'mon, DEATH THREATS?!?) just for voicing their opinions. The fact that I loved the album as much as I did was just a pleasant added bonus.\n I was just as intrigued (and equally pleased!) when I read about sisters Emily Robison and Martie Mcguire's side project, COURT YARD HOUNDS. This infectious amalgamation should get under the skin ~ and stay there! ~ of anyone who loves pop, rock, country, bluegrass, Americana and, especially, Sheryl Crow.\n Things open on a gentle, relaxed note with the subdued, albeit sublime, \"Skyline.\" Anchored by an arrangement that literally floats out of the speakers, Robison's lead vocal is delicate, yet steely. Toss in some bittersweet lyrics (\"What am I doin' here\/In such a lonely place?\/Birds fly below\/I'm high up in my cage\") and you have a powerhouse of an album opener.\n \"The Coast\" is one of my favorite cuts off of CYH....there's just an exuberant joyfulness to the track that wins you over right from the first listen. Robison's lead vocal simply soars, while the arrangement bops along at a finger-popping gait. This track is pop music at it's finest, sheer aural perfection....and a WHOLE lot of fun!\n There's a smooth, easy-going give and take vibe to \"Delight (Something New Under The Sun).\" When things amp up for the chorus, well, it feels natural and real. There's an overall ebb and flow to the cut that's just mesmerizing...by the time you get to that bridge...WOW! One of the disc's nicest moments.\n Things take a 180 with \"See You In The Spring\", an aching duet with Jakob Dylan. This story of a doomed bi-coastal romance sports a stunning pair of vocals, a heartfelt arrangement and powerful lyrics (\"Well, babe, can't you give it time?\/I'll keep you warm at night\/This town's all I know\/And I could see you in my life\"). Lovely.\n And then there's \"Ain't No Son.\" This bluegrass strummer soon morphs into a blistering rocker, as it tells the tale of a bitter father who can't accept who his son is. Great vocal, great instrumentation....but it's the lyrics that really hit hard here: \"Stranger, stranger on the wall\/When the neighbors come to call\/I just don't know what to say\/So I put you away\/This time I won't leave a trace\/I'll fill up the empty space.\" Another winner!\n There's a striking similarity throughout much of COURT YARD HOUNDS to a lot of Sheryl Crow's work, and nowhere is that more evident than on \"Fairytale.\" Simple, sincere, honest, real....Robinson's vocal just tugs at your heartstrings. And when she gets to the closing lines of \"Every girl wants the fairytale\/I guess I do too\"...well, they just snap!\n \"I Miss You\" is chock full of silly lyrics (\"I miss you\/I can't wait to kiss you\"...really? REALLY??), but the arrangement is so melodic and tuneful that you can't help but forgive the track it's lyrical transgressions. Add in a lead vocal to the mix that is both sultry and sly and a throwaway cut becomes an enchanting winner.\n Martie Mcguire takes center stage on the gauzy \"Gracefully.\" Blessed with a strong lead vocal, haunting arrangement and mournful instrumentation, you're left wanting more from her. Here's hoping that, unlike Jean Millington and the work she's done with sister June since their days in Fanny, and Nancy Wilson with big sister Ann in Heart, Mcguire won't take such a back seat to Robison on future CYH projects.\n \"Delicate\" is also the best way to describe the gorgeous \"April's Love.\" With it's minimal arrangement (love the cello!) and feathery lead vocal, there's just something hypnotic about the cut. Pointed lyrics (\"You didn't take a stand\/You didn't hold my hand\/You should have held on tight\") round out another real gem.\n \"Then Again\" is another one of my favorite cuts...there's just a quirky, clever edge to the track! The arrangement just kind of chugs along, while Robison's vocal has a nice little lilt to it, sort of coy, kind of playful. All of this (barely) masks the sardonic lyrics (\"And just to keep the peace and quiet\/I'd forfeit my peace of mind\/Then again, I never did understand me\"). A powerful blend of light...and dark.\n However, the disc's true high point has to be the rollicking \"It Didn't Make A Sound.\" Part bluegrass shuffle, part boogie-woogie stomper, this rave-up's fun from start to finish (I particularly love that juke-jammin' piano!!). Blend in another sexy lead vocal and you have one of the Top 25 recordings of the last decade. Mark my word, this is a mass appeal hit just waiting to happen! LOVE....IT!!!\n Things wind down with the touching \"Fear Of Wasted Time\", an ode to evolution, change, quiet moments and not wasting one second once you realize how precious each one is. Ethereal vocals, muted, yet sweet, instrumentation and insightful lyrics (\"Time might pass me by\/If I close my eyes\/So I'm on the next plane\/Leavin' town\") all meld together in a perfectly cohesive manner. The perfect way to end an already stunning effort!\n And COURT YARD HOUNDS is just that, a stunning piece of work that proves Emily Robison and Martie Mcguire are true contenders. Any thoughts anyone may have that these two are simply that other Chick's back-up band have now, once and for all, been squashed like a bug on a Texas windshield. I, for one, can't wait to see what these sisters do next! (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics...a real rarity in releases this year!).","classification":4,"fold":8}

This is what I gather, anyway, as her 15 minutes of fame was already up several years before I was born.  I was introduced to this phenomenom as a young child, as my parents had a copy of this floating around that they'd received as a Christmas gag gift from some friends circa late 60s.  Always rearing it's bed-haired head around the holidays, when the whole family gathered around the stereo for a good laugh.  Funniest selections are:  the frightening \"Monday, Monday\", Nancy Sinatra's \"These Boots Are Made for Walking,\" as well as dad's \"Stranger's in the Night\" (dooooo-beee-dooooo-beeeee-dooooooooo!!)  and the all time Mrs. Miller classic \"Downtown\", complete with out of time vocals and ear-piercing bird whistles.

{"text":"Powerman 5000 hit pay-dirt (speaking both from a commercial and creative standpoint) with their 1999 album, \"Tonight The Stars Revolt,\" which was well-produced and featured the breakthrough single \"When Worlds Collide.\" And ever since then, the Massachussets-based collective have never been able to match the level of success achieved on that release, nor have they really been able to buckle down and focus on having just one sound be all their own. And you would be forgiven for thinking that on full-length effort number seven, 2014's \"Builders Of The Future,\" PM5K have once again failed to return to form. This is primarily due to the fact that, aside from founding member\/frontman Spider One, the band have enlisted an almost entirely new lineup (from guitarist to percussionist to turntablist --everybody is different, here!). But this would actually be a misleading assumption, because \"Builders...\" actually captures the band (and their most energetic and aggressive industrial metal-sound) in a better place then they have been in long, long time.\n\nTracks like \"We Want It All,\" \"Live It Up Before You're Dead,\" and the superbly, rhythmically swinging opener, \"Invade, Destroy, Repeat,\" augment their catchy, shuffling rhythms, and steady, chugging guitars, with extremely huge, hooky and infectious choruses that evoke several Nineties-era Rob Zombie and White Zombie classics. But while all this profusely hard-rocking nu-metal is going on, there is also a more subdued, melodic and moody side to the record that many listeners may initially overlook. This involves two main cuts, those being \"I Want To Kill You,\" an extremely dark and creepy, acoustic-strummed near ballad with lyrics and ambiance guaranteed to send a child through your veins; and \"I Can't F'ing Hear You,\" which is actually not the brutal mosh-pit anthem that its title promises. It is more along the lines of a piece of early Ministry-inspired electronic metal that is heavy on synthesizers, danceable rhythms, repetitive rock back beats, and vocals that are actually semi-tuneful (!).\n\nBut those aren't the only highlights, though. There are pretty much two other gems on this set, and they include the ominous backing synths, honest-to-god guitar solo (!!), and borderline anthemic, and fist-pumpable choruses found in \"How To Be A Human\"; and \"Modern World,\" which brings the fist-pumping hard rock\/nu-metal back, and does so in droves, as it is fueled by and centered around a huge, pit-stoking chorus and memorable vocal refrain.  Neither of the final two songs that I have not mentioned yet (\"You're Gonna Love It, Whether You Like It Or Not\" and the closing \"Evil Workld\") are bad by any stretch of the imagination; they are just kind of forgettable, and both fail to add much to the equation, when looking at the big picture.\n\nPowerman 5000 have spent pretty much their whole career trying to decide what they want to sound like. This has involved writing insanely catchy hit singles, exploring surprisingly angry and heavy ground, but also periodically getting trapped in generic territory. And while on \"Builders Of The Future,\" the band still cannot claim to possess a sound that is all their own (as it does not exactly reinvent the wheel), it is nonetheless a very solid industrial metal\/hard rock\/nu-metal record, and a very enjoyable one at that. Indeed, this is a sizeable step forward\/in the right direction for the band, and you cannot tell me that this isn't their best effort since 1999's \"Tonight The Stars Revolt.\"","classification":4,"fold":8}

The other songs fit well into the theme of this movie even though i haven't seen it yet. Songs i didn't know before, now i have a new love for, like Ryan Adams and Graham Parker. But the real surprise was when Louden Wainwright's song came on and a few bars in to the song i suddenly here his son, Rufus! Much to my surprise of course, i had no idea because the liner notes don't mention it. The song 'The Days We Die' is emotional and the vocals are beautiful.

{"text":"I don't understand why so many people are saying that Alanis is like a 13 year-old on this record! PLEASE, DON'T LISTEN TO THESE PEOPLE! These people either have not listened to the album at all or they only gave it one quick listen. People seem to expect to put a CD in their player and to like it immediately. Well, I bought this back on May 19, and only recently have I completely come to understand the album line-by-line, note by note, piece by piece, and appreciate it for all it's worth. People need to realize these things take time. URS is 100% Alanis. Alanis has once again made herself \"naked\" to the listener, and people don't seem to appreciate that. What she offers are good songs about real life situations that Alanis has faced, and many of us have too, more or less. Guys, it's amazing stuff. If you are not into autobiographical songwriters, however, than this isn't for you, because that's exactly what Alanis is, but I am one to applaud her for it, for she does the job very honestly and skillfully, and makes the best music there is, as far as I'm concerned. (Please note: SISTER BLISTER, BENT 4 U, and the best song she's ever made, SORRY 2 MYSELF were all made for this album and left off, among many others, and they are even better than most of the songs on this album, so check out the PRECIOUS ILLUSIONS and HANDS CLEAN import singles. BENT 4 U is definitely going to be included on her upcoming EP, that I know for a fact. But one thing's for sure, if you doubt Alanis even a little bit, you must listen to SORRY 2 MYSELF, as well as UTOPIA, who I'm sure many lazy reviewers haven't even listened to. Why? Because it's the last track on the disc, and judging from the instantly negative attitudes in some of these reviews I can tell that a lot of reviewers probably never even bothered to flip to the end of the CD for the final track, because if they had their reviews could not be negative, they could not.)","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Rick Springfield has been anything but bland, from his breakout \"Jessie's Girl\" to his previous release, SHOCK\/DENIAL\/ANGER\/ACCEPTANCE.  THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is, unfortunately, a largely bland effort.  Springfield is still at the top of his form as a picker (there are some excellent guitar riffs in here), but his voice has gotten worse (worked well on SDAA, but a raspy, spoken-voiced version of \"Imagine\"?  Come on).\n\nTherefore, this record will undoubtably not win Springfield any new fans, nor please his old ones (especially since it's a cover album, and he has only one original on here that doesn't measure up to his usual songwriting standards).  The main flaw of the record is this: Springfield relies heavily on the drum machines he criticized in his hit \"Human Touch.\"  In fact, this sounds more like a pop record than a rock record, with the saxaphones keeping it from going into Brittany Spears territory.  And while most of the songs he chose are of great quality, and while a few of his performances shine (\"Life In A Northern Town\" and \"Miss You Nights\" specifically), THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is undeniably a let-down.  Maybe the album after this one will feature Springfield, if not in his finest vocal form, at least writing his own tunes again, and either making us swoon as in his 80s hits, or getting us pissed off as he did with SDAA.","classification":3,"fold":8}

Ne-Yo for his part mirrors this by saying that you would have known what to expect if you approached the situation like some men do.\n\nYou'll have to decide for yourself the truth of the argument, but I can tell you this: You'll put this one on repeat over and over again.

{"text":"Much of Depeche Modes earlier material was more new-wave synth pop and more poppy in sound but this album is where they would become the dark depressing masters they are now. Some of the songs did stir up some controversy back when this album was released and this album was a major turning point for this amazing band.\nSomething to Do is a hard edged number that kicks this CD off. Lie To Me is an amazing song that I listen to many times without tiring. The dark melody, the sad sound to it is a treat for my ears. People Are People is a fabolous song with phat beats, killer bass lines and a sort of industrial feel. This song is about all people of all religions, races, etc. to get along regardless of their differences. This song has a great message. The ambience at the ending forever leaves this album in my memory. It doesn't matter doesn't have any major beats but has dingling synths and a both happy and sad sound to it. This song is great. Stories Of Old is another cool song but nto as great as the next one. This song is rather poppy. Somebody is a very sad piano ballad with simply pianos and Martin Gore on vocals. This song is truly a gem on this CD. Master And Servant stirred some controversy back during it's heyday. It's a hard-edged song with a strong industrial feel. This song from what I guess talks about S&M. This is my second favorite. If You Want is my favorite off SGR. It starts off as a creepy electronic song with creepy keyboards and with no drums for the first minute. At 1:30 the drums starts and the song becomes an industrial new wave dance number. Blasphemous Rumours is the one that caused controversy back in 1984. It's a very depressing song about religous doubt and suicide. It's a very sad closer to this amazing album.\nThis CD marks the turning point for Depeche Mode and all of their latter music. While not as strong as their next 5 albums this is a very good album and should be in every DM fans collection.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Honestly, this collection is worth the $0.99 price tag - get it while it lasts. When it goes up to $9.99 like most of the other Bach Guild collections, pass it up.\n\nThis Bach Guild release is by far the weakest of its releases so far. The vocal music varies in quality. Some of it is really poor - choirs that are out of tune, old recordings that sound really dated - and the sound quality of most of the pieces is subpar. It's vinyl sound without the actual vinyl.\n\nSome of the recordings are solid - I really enjoyed the organ selections and the Utah Symphony's Messiah is solid. I liked 1\/2 of the Deller stuff - his old medival and renaissance stuff works for the vocal style, but the Victorian and more recent stuff doesn't.\n\nIn the end I kept about 1\/2 of the stuff, deleted the rest. Again, it's a great value (especially at $0.99), but keep your expectations low.","classification":3,"fold":8}

The classic song still brings out the best in power ballads from that era, and still feels just as fresh and invigorant today as it did back then. It definitely will always stand out, and doesn't feel like it is wimpy like the cover of the classic that Mariah Carey made as a trainwreck in 2009.

While he got his start writing for Tina Fey on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/30-Rock\/dp\/B000RBA6CO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">30 Rock<\/a>, he's expanded to the cast of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Community\/dp\/B002N5N5LG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Community<\/a>, released a rap album (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/CAMP\/dp\/B00605YUQ4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">CAMP<\/a>), and moved into the world of stand-up comedy.  I don't really consider myself a fan of Glover -- I think he's funny, but I don't normally seek out his work.  I stumbled upon his first live comedy album and gave it a chance.  Now, I'm glad I did: Donald Glover is a natural story-teller.\n\nOn WEIRDO, Glover's style is almost completely story-driven.  In many ways, he reminds me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mike-Birbiglia\/dp\/B000X6UAWY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mike Birbiglia<\/a>; the material Donald Glover works with on stage is pulled from autobiographical events.  Throughout WEIRDO, he also adds some racial commentary, but for the most part, the album is a collection of stories.  And while Glover didn't make his bones in stand-up, his style works really well on stage.  It feels less like a funnyman on stage reading off jokes and more like someone who enjoys telling stories having fun with the audience.  The best moments happen when Glover gets personal, like when he remembers his childhood in \"Kix,\" \"S'mores,\" or \"Home Depot.\"\n\nSome of the content here feels like old territory: white people using the \"N word,\" the difference between men and women, etc...  When Glover focuses on race, it's to mixed results.  It never comes across as preachy, but the attempt to make social commentary isn't as funny its surrounding material.  For an album called WEIRDO, it's really not that gross, strange, or bizarre.  As successful Donald Glover has been on television, I have a feeling that he has an equally great stand-up comedy career ahead of him as well.\n\nI would strongly recommend this album to any and all Donald Glover fans (whether it be his work on television or music).  For those unfamiliar with him, this comedy album is just as strong as most comedy veterans'.  Highlights for this particular show: \"Tiny Hitlers,\" \"Poop,\" and \"Kix.\"","classification":4,"fold":8}

Unfortunately when he left the group their music style changed quite a bit and I no longer just follow them.\n\nI brought this CD because it has some of my most favorite songs by the Doobie Brothers.  I have all of Michael McDonald's music and I cannot wait for them to do a reunion tour if that is ever in the works.  The Doobie Brothers played at Red Rocks but the magic that I once felt for them was just not there.  I recommend this CD if you want to get your Doobie Fix.","classification":5,"fold":8}

I don't have a top of the line sound system, but the collection's sound quality was excellant. Some of the tracks start out with very low volume so I might have missed some of that.

{"text":"\"Screaming For Vengeance,\" the sixth album proper from the almighty English heavy metal quintet Judas Priest, is a resounding success. Although not quite as amazing as 1980's watershed release \"British Steel,\" it is still a timeless classic. It is also one of the most influential records of the 1980's, as it would prove to go on to inspire an unquantifiable number of power metal, progressive metal, and thrash\/speed metal bands.\n\n\"S.F.V.\" is full of the heavy metal good stuff. What this means is expect tons of stellar, passionate vocals from frontman Rob Halford, a tight rhythm section -- comprised of Dave Holland's deft, natural-sounding drumming and Ian Hill's steady bass bottom -- and, most importantly, great riffs and even greater solos from axe-duo-extraordinaire Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing.\n\nThe record blasts off with \"The Hellion,\" an early piece of thrash\/speed metal. It is a lightning-fast blitzkrieg of speed punk-ish drumming (including an eight-second long, bouncy, crashing drum solo in the intro), propulsive speed metal riffs, grumbling bass notes, and catchy and commanding vocals. A fist-pumping chorus is also included, and the opener is capped off by both a soaring, several-parted melodic solo and some neat twin-guitar harmonies. \"Electric Eye, \"with its hooky, single-note, riff, crashing drum beat, galloping, head-bobbing rhythm, is quite possibly the catchiest song found anywhere on here. And a ripping, classical-sounding guitar solo is also included. \"Riding On The Wind\" is another insanely rhythmic head-banger backed by industrial-strength, churning guitar leads, punchy, dexterous drumming, and strong, humming bass line. (And dig the tune's choral interludes, too.)\n\n\"Bloodstone\"'s crunchy, fiery, machine-gun guitar licks (that come cascading down on the listener's eardrums), galloping, chugging bass line, and soulful, melodic singing make it another standout. It also has a bouncy drum beat that fills any leftover space perfectly well, and, like the riffage, some similarly fiery melodic soloing to end. \"(Take These) Chains\" marries a cool, futuristic-sounding intro with strong, propulsive, staccato guitar hooks, and a steady, humming bass bottom. And its chant-worthy sing-along vocals and huge, concert-ready choruses serve as just the icing on the cake. \"Pain And Pleasure\" has stellar, power metal-esque vocals (that practically scream \"classic Halford!\"), and muscular, churning rhythms. But for the most part, though, this is a bass-driven song; as it features some very interesting and noteworthy bass work throughout. (This includes a funky-sounding bottom-end and some meaty, heavy bass throbs.)\n\nThe title track may have catchy, shouted vocals, but it is the guitarists that take over the spotlight, here. And they do so with crunching riffs and epic, instinctively memorable, and pyrotechnic soloing. \"You've Got Another Thing Comin',\" however, is highlighted by what is perhaps \"S.F.V.\"'s best solo -- and what a lengthy, mazy, complex, multi-parted, soulfully emphatic, and wailing solo it is, too. It is classic Judas Priest, through and through. \"You've Got...,\" which is a semi-power ballad, is also highlighted by dreamy acoustic guitar melodies, crunchy electric guitars, and piercingly falsetto and harmonic, glass-shattering vocals. And another solo -- this one is of the more blistering, shredding, and wah-drenched variety -- comes ripping through the mix, too.\n\n\"Feber\" is another cut of early speed metal, as it is a propulsive, lean and mean number with a memorable, pounding main riff, chug and churning rhythms, an adherent, mosh pit-ready groove, and another unorthodox, shredding, whammy bar solo. \"Devil's Child\" (which is the proper end of the album) lays gentle acoustic strums and atmospheric keyboards against thudding, throbbing rhythms, thus creating a new-wavy, and borderline -creepy vibe. Some deliciously melodic leads and an acoustic guitar solo help this cause, though, too. Finally, the set wraps up with a bunch of flawlessly-executed live renditions of various songs -- most of which were recorded live at the San Antonio civic center in September of 1982. And a b-side from the 1985 \"Turbo\" recording sessions (\"Prisoner Of Your Eyes\") is also included as a bonus track.\n\nOne of the Priest's greatest achievements.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Mary J. Blige follows \"The Breakthrough\" with \"Growing Pains\" which to me was an even stronger effort that claims the title of being one of her best, if not the best, albums of her career. She found her footing with \"The Breakthrough\" and any fears that she'd return with a cd that wasn't as strong should be put aside. \"Growing Pains\" has something for all of her fans and new ones, a sound that mirrors old R&B but also goes into territory that music seems afraid to venture into. After listening to the entire album, I found myself saying this was true quality. There isn't really a track to skip here; each song adds something to the mix and covers everything from a dance-vibe to a laid-back groove about love and loss.\n\nSome of the standout tracks are \"Work That\" which is one of the upbeat songs, \"Grown Woman\" that could be this albums \"Enough Crying\" with Mary dishing out her good qualities and what makes her stand out at this point in her life. \"Feel Like A Woman\" is a new kind of song for Blige where she puts aside her reservations about being with someone and shows her most vulnerable of traits in this ballad-like track. \"Stay Down\" stands as my favorite, another turn for Mary J. Blige as she's asking her man to stay through the troubles and paints a picture of better days in their relationship that are to come. \"Roses\" is another track, more hard in sound, with Blige proclaiming she's all right and doesn't need people telling her what's wrong with her. \"Fade Away\" and \"What Love Is\" both are tracks that stand out for their production and the feeling she evokes. In what's perhaps one of her best closing tracks, \"Come To Me (Peace)\", is a big R&B\/80s type of song that's a no-holds-barge explosion of sound and is moving and leaves you wanting more.\n\nIn all, \"Growing Pains\" is an absolute must own. Where most artist hit their peak at some point and become predictable, Mary J. Blige seems to be getting better with each year. The songs on this cd are fresh, original and yet sound different and a bit experimental for Blige as she matures into her new sound and comfort zone as an artist. Buy this cd, you will not be disappointed.","classification":5,"fold":8}

There are a few really good songs in addition to the perfect:  Pieces and Paper Dolls, and then like nearly all CD's a few fluff pieces just to fill the album.

Rob Thomas has a great voice and it is used well in the songs, especially the 2 great ones.  Also, excellent back ground female singer on Paper Dolls which really adds a European touch.

She had the advantage from being from the '60s era depicted in the 1976 film. Rather than use the vocals of the actors (Irene Cara, Lonette McKee) in that film, music producer, Curtis Mayfield  collaborated with \"ReeRee\" and put it out to chart and sell records. The record they did still holds up against this half-baked attempt. I hope the upcoming film re-make fairs better. NOT!","classification":2,"fold":8}

Both songs (Poker Face & Bad Romance) clock-in at 119 beats per minute, both are in the key of Am, both have the same producer, the \"m-m-m-ma\" of Poker Face is plainly re-worded into new (but similar) jabberwocky and placed next to the chorus as if a Poker Face cookie-cutter was all one needed to ship platinum anymore....\n\nIt's clear that Gaga is a fan of movie director Alfred Hitchcock: she sings, \"I want your PSYCHO, your VERTIGO schtik, want you in my REAR WINDOW...\" I don't know if this was intentional or not -- the naming of films here by the same director seems a bit too cute to be accidental. I half expected to see THE BIRDS swoop in from NORTH BY NORTHWEST in the video, with a TORN CURTAIN thrown in for good measure.\n\nThe production here is first-rate, and is a fine lead-off single for this 8-song unit between albums -- and I have little doubt the song will strike platinum -- I can think of at least a half-dozen solid ways to re-mix this; a ballad version could even be built in A minor from what I've heard here and sell strongly -- but Gaga, if you're reading this, let me tell you something: if you intend to have a career, you better drop the idea of selling the same record over and over and over.

Quesadilla is a weird little number that has dark verses and happy, synthy choruses. Lisa Baby is a little slower, kind of like Different Colors from TIH. Next in Line is another fun one with spot-on vocal delivery. Anna Sun is a CLASSIC. It's got melodic vocal delivery, a slight sense of rocking out, and is just beautiful. Tightrope is fast and melodic. Jenny sounds exactly like a Killers song, with its speed and synth. Shiver Shiver is downright funky, and as a bonus, has pretty relatable lyrics. Lions is a cute interlude. Iscariot is a very slow, deep song. I really didn't know WTM could leave so much of an impact on me! Fixin' sounds like if you crossed Fall out Boy with Mexican-style dance pop. I can Lift a Car is a little more rockin', kind of like U2, and closes the album well.

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"One of the best Christmas albums I have heard in many years. Green Hill's two previous Christmas samplers are also excellent. While some of the titles are duplicated from one year to the next, many of the arrangements are different.\n\nMy guests really enjoyed it. You can listen to it in the background, or you can turn it up. The sound quality and arrangements are superb. I listened to the 2012 through the 2014 albums over the weekend and there was not a single dud on any of the three yearly CD\/MP3 collections.\n\nFor the price you can't complain. Highly recommended! My friends wanted the URL, so they could download their own copies.","classification":5,"fold":8}
{"text":"Blue Merle--file them away in that place in your mind where you put scents long remembered, summer mornings when the roses have been out a little too long and the air is full of their fragrance, lovely and sweet.  This is music to explore, like a boy explores the cliff in the woods outside his house, delighted to find so many things to do and see.  This is music for lakes, and for rivers, and for ice-cream.\n\nMuch has been made of the resemblance between Luke's voice and that of the lead singer of Coldplay.  Indeed, his voice is eerily similar; fortunately, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Chris's voice is emotive and anguished, and Luke's is much the same, which suits this lovely music perfectly. Some might persuasively argue that it would better serve Blue Merle to have a vocalist with a voice more uniquely his own.  While a voice less reminiscent of that of Coldplay might be desirable for some, ultimately, no one can deny the power and maturity with which Luke uses his voice.  Did Chris influence him?  Probably.  There is no crime in that.  Could Luke have chosen to sing in a different style?  Perhaps.  But would that have suited the music as well? Probably not.  I think that he was blessed with a voice that performs well in the style in which he has chosen to use it, and we should be grateful.  Maturity and further listening will probably help to separate the two in our minds as the bands grow in different directions.  Musically, the two bands are not that similar, although there is much to admire in Blue Merle for fanatics of Coldplay.\n\nNow, about the music itself?  At the risk of sounding trite, the  guitars really do shimmer, the banjos sparkle in a setting of solid drumming and inventive bass.  The lyrics are excellent, and reveal more on repeated listening, which is a benchmark which I use to decide who gets my 5th star or not.  The entire album is excellent, no weak tracks, and the more I hear it, the more glad I am to listen to it.  Some might consider it a flaw that there is no one \"stand out\" track--no one track that is so instantly memorable or catchy as to be the obvious single.  But this is not music for singles, a treat to be digested quickly and best given with insulin--it is music for sustenance.\n\nFor fans of Coldplay, John Mayer, Dave Matthews, Counting Crows and Jeff Buckley, this is likely a band to watch and an album to love instantly, suitable to for enthusiastic recommendation to friends.  For fans of the well crafted pop song, this album is reason for excitement as well, especially if you like your pop drenched in complicated guitar work and gilded with a newgrass sensibility.  For everyone else, find out what you are missing.  Blue Merle are worth the ride.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"You know, I have been listening to a lot of 1965-67 Coltrane lately, and as essential as this is to my system, I need a break.\n\nAnd maybe that was part of the idea Charles Lloyd had when he put out Forest Flower in 1967. Coltrane, Shepp, Taylor, The Black Panthers, protest vs. revolution. All this had taken over jazz that year. So Charles Lloyd comes along, and Forest Flower says--\"This is all supposed to be fun. Chill for a second. We'll make the demonstration tomorrow. Let's play some tunes. RELAX!\"\n\nNot that these \"tunes\" leave subtance lacking. Lloyds sense of harmony and melody is increadible. Listening to is chord structres, I feel as if a Beatles or Brian Wilson has been channeled into a jazz man. His chords are so tuneful, this music is just a joy to listen to. Fresh and clean now as it was the day it was born.\n\nI don't have to tell you about the skill of Keith Jarret or Jack Dejonette--there is a reason Miles inducted them--and proof is right here.\n\nThere was a lot of great jazz like this during this era, and unfortunately, it gets hidden in the shadow of giants like Coltrane, Miles, and Archie Shepp. Listen to them always, but dig on this sometimes, too.","classification":4,"fold":8}

I guess I seen this one coming after hearing about his 4th divorce, recent negative interviews, political bashing, anti Jew\/Isreal stuff, and even negative comments about David Gilmour, angry rants, and bashing Trump and others at the recent live shows.  This guy is one angry grumpy old man.  But I could have forgiven all that for a great new album after all it's only the music I really care about in the end. But tons of political stuff, F bombs, bad language, and some pretty good songs toward the beginning of the album ruined by profanity.  Deja Vu is the only song I like because at least he made that song without saying the F word 7-8 times throughout.  But it's also ironic that he talks about what he would have done had he been God (yet he's a professed atheist).  Toward the end of the album when he finally stops cursing, every song runs together (slow, generic boring numbers).  Wait For Her, Oceans Apart, and Part Of Me Died sound like the same song and stuff that could have easily been put on the weakest Floyd record The Final Cut.  After the brilliant Amused To Death 25 years ago this is what we get.  Oh well, we will always have the classic Floyd albums he helped make and a couple MUCH better solo albums!","classification":1,"fold":8}

{"text":"If you need to fill holes in your Mozart collection, or you're looking to replace that lost or broken CD.  Or, if you've never bought a Mozart CD or MP3, then this is the collection for you - at $1.99 you can hardly go wrong.  You can't beat the price with a stick and you get hours and hours of quality music by the greatest composer of all time.  There's the Jupiter Symphony and his Requiem Mass among others.  Between the piano pieces, the chamber music, the orchestral pieces, then orchestral with choir, everything is fully covered.  This is music at it's best!  Mozart was clearly a genius, and it shows on the tracks on this MP3 download.  Use it for relaxing, meditation, or as the background for your life.  It's simply beautiful!\n\nFOR THE MUSIC PURISTS:  Use this to fill holes in your collection - it's so cheap, it's almost like stealing.  There's so much here that you can't go wrong, even if some aren't perfectly executed.\n\nFOR EVERYONE ELSE: Use this to build your collection.  There are at least 8 other MP3 downloads like this one which would start the basis for a lovely classical music library. If you get to the point where a piece doesn't sound right, or bothers you in any way, go out and explore alternatives.  There are tons out there.  What I like, you may not, and vice versa.  For example, the only people I like play Rachmaninoff are Rachmaninoff and Mischa Dikter.  Yet, I'm told a lot of people play him well - I just don't agree.  It's all personal taste.  Take recommendations, but figure out what you like yourself.\n\n At $1.99 each, that makes it under $18.00 to have 1800 tracks of 9 classical masters, ranging from Bach to Debussy.  You can't even buy a family of 4 fastfood for that little.  Or you could buy 18 tracks on i-tunes, not 1800.  I can tell you, I did it, and it's been the soundtrack to the greater part of my life since I did so.  It especially makes wonderful background music while reading anything from fiction to nonfiction - and of course making dinner.  You can't beat this deal - just buy this!  Buy all of them!

If you want them to sound like they do when your actually at the concert then this double live record is for you......and me!\nYes, DLRs vocals are not perfect but that's part of the charm. The band is tight( including Wolfie who does pretty well on backing vocals too) but as usual the main weapon is EVH. I've stated it before( see my review for ADKOT) and I'll say it again, EVH plays his best \" Brown Sound\" guitar when DLR is on vocals. Could be because of DLRs limitations or Eddie is simply more inspired but all I know is it's fantastic.\nA lot of folks over the years have always pointed out that Diamond Dave is more a showmen or front man then a singer. Well that's somewhat true but not the whole picture. Dave's voice works as an instrument that accompanys Van Halens style of ragged and intense hard RnR!\nI liked Sammy too and he is defiantly a better vocalist but when DLR is with them they kick it up a notch.\n5 stars and a whole lot of fun!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"It is less than 12 months ago that the Chicago musician and guitar wunderkid Ryley Walker released his debut album \"All Kinds of You\". This record was a musical stake in the ground announcing a huge talent who could tap prime sources like Bert Jansch and John Renbourn yet make music that ticked all the boxes for a modern audience. This follow up album \"Primrose Green\" sees Walker breath out and particularly start to reference great songwriters like Tim Buckley and John Martyn. In doing so we see the development of his expressionist vocal style and emerging proof that despite all the obvious influences at play Walker is incrementally moving onto his own ground and will be a major force in modern music.\n\n\"Primrose Green\" starts with gusto on the exuberant title track with its clear 60s vibe. Behind Walker are a set of seasoned Chicago jazz musicians who colour in all the relevant shades across the this album not least the wonders of double bassist Anton Hatwich. Nowhere is this more evident than on the standout \"Summer Dress\" which harks back to the fusion of folk, blues and jazz that owes a debt to Tim Buckley's \"Starsailor\". The rolling guitar motif of \"Same minds\" is well executed while \"Griffiths Buck's Blues\" will have any technical guitarists scratching their heads in wonder. There are echoes of Nick Drake on the jazzy ballad \"Love can be cruel\" while another standout \"On the banks of the old Kishwaukee\" introduces summer sunshine into proceedings. Walker also lets rip on electric guitar on the powerful \"Sweet Satisfaction\" a song, which could point the way ahead for a new direction in for his music, although it does echo John Martyn's \"I'd rather be the devil\". Finally the acoustic strum of \"Hide in the Roses\" brings gentle closure to proceedings with Walkers expressive vocals sounding almost British in origin.\n\nRyley Walker is not as yet the finished product and is still seeking his own \"sound\". Accusations could be levelled of him that he could tip over into derivative territory if he continues to plunder these influences. Equally his lyrics do not always match the wonders of the music. And yet there is promise on this sophomore album in overflowing abundance. \"Primrose Green\" is an exceedingly fine piece of music by musicians who love to ply their trade. When all the mighty forces link together for Ryley Walker he will be unstoppable.","classification":4,"fold":8}

Great performances on bass, guitar, and drums, everyone is at the top of their game, production is really good on this album and songwriting \/ arranging is strong as well.  Lemmy's vocals are what you'd expect, absolutely nothing wrong with 'em.  As others have mentioned great cover of Sympathy for the Devil.  As for the 2010 album the World is Yours, there were two really good songs on it I Know What You Need & Bye Bye B Bye Bye.

Unfortunately, in their current tour, they only play the title track (not the entire suite by that name) and a recorded version of the Overture.  And the title track was not performed well at all. I'll enjoy this album for many years, but the 7\/30\/11 concert was the worst Yes show in my participation of every tour since 1976. I wish they'd dropped the repeat of old standards like AYAI, ST, CTTE, HOTS, Roundabout, etc and done this album in it's entirety. They tend to rely on the old standards year after year on tour, and you could tell Howe was bored and improvising new parts that didn't work. Benoit needs vocal training to extend his phrasing and to stay on pitch.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"To call Some Great Reward synth pop is unfair since that means that it is ligt sounding and has lyrics that basically talk about nothing. Some Great Reward is an amazing mid 80's release and has tracks People are People, Master and Servant that all shot up to the top of charts all over the world. This album also has strong non single tracks like lie to me and something to do. They are much more experimental then their critics ever give them credit for and the sounds used on Some Great Reward and Construction Times Again are not even remotely the same. The lyrics are not as trite as many critics have accused the for being and I consider it to be one of the best albums released that year.","classification":5,"fold":8}
{"text":"Since so much of the music sounds so eerily and objectively similar,it is all too easy to discount all contemporary American pop music as a waste of ones time. There are however artists in this arena who are giving more than the expected to the public they musically serve. While Katy Perry is surely among them,the one thing I've always taken issue with her about is that her music is uneven. Especially with the case of her previous album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Teenage-Dream\/dp\/B003L77TZI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Teenage Dream<\/a>,she definitely came off as a bit of a singles artist in terms of musical inventiveness. In terms of albums,she definitely tended to chase trends rather than set them. Her melodic,hook filled sound is ripe for many variations. And on this album there is a sense she's starting to realize that more fully.\n\n  \"Roar\",\"Legendary\" and \"Dark Horse\",the (thankfully) one song featuring a guest rapper-in this case Juicy J all sound on the surface exactly what you'd expect from 21'st century pop. Though they seem to revel in their cliches instrumentally,Katy's songwriting and vocal arrangement benefit from a genuine move away from Western pop music structures and more towards more East Indian\/Asian styles of harmony and melodicism. \"Birthday\" and \"International Smile\" are both joyous uptempo songs with a funky dance flavor-full of horn and guitar breaks that I've heard referred to as \"nu disco\". It's the sound that seems to most suit Perry creatively and these two very welcomed inclusions are two of my favorites here. \"Walking On Air\" has a thick house flavor while \"Unconditionally\",\"Ghost\",\"Love Me\",\"Double Rainbow\" and \"By The Grace Of Good\" are all elaborate electronic epic pop with multiple sections-some soft,some very dramatic.\n\n  \"This Moment\" is another favorite of mine-showcasing a stripped down bass synthesizer based new wave\/funk groove that she also goes into on a slower and more grooving sense on \"This Is How We Do\".-this time with more elaborate production. The one thing that makes this one of Katy Perry's stronger album statements is that the lyrics and music all reflect a great deal of musical growth. She openly sings about her needs and insecurities in a manner that's not only appealing from her but also generationally educational. By continuing to delve into her own influence from classic soul music of melding the secular and the religious almost seamlessly,she reminds herself and everyone else that if life is the game,the best play to make is to be open to others emotionally-not merely live for and within yourself. While no one,myself included,would likely consider Katy Perry a particularly soul oriented artist,that particular influence seems to play well with Perry's songwriting,lyrics and general musicality. Overall? Likely her strongest album to date.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"In the 1960's Motown billed itself as \"The Sound of Young America\". It most certainly was. A young Detroit entrepreneur named Berry Gordy Jr. decided that he was going to start his own record company. His idea was a simple one really. He was going to make records with black artists that appealed to the largest segment of the record buying public which in those days was suburban white teenagers. His formula worked to perfection.\n\nAmong the first artists signed to Gordy's fledgling Motown label was a 17 year old R&B singer from Detroit named Mary Wells. Hearing about this exciting new enterprise Wells approached Berry Gordy Jr. with a tune she had written for Jackie Wilson called \"Bye Bye Baby: Gordy was duly impressed and immediately signed her to Motown. Within just a year she had her first charted single.\n\nIn July 1962 Motown released \"You Beat Me to the Punch\". The song would become Mary's second Top Ten hit peaking at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart. Looking back, Mary Wells really was Motown's very first star performer. Nice tune!","classification":4,"fold":8}

But out of all the songs the trio had done, the one that has stood the test of time and beyond in Every Breath You Take. It is definitely one of the most iconic songs of all time that has put words beyond what could ever be said. I like the song not only because of the rhythm, but it really takes me back to a time when music was really becoming all about fads in the 80's, but this songs goes beyond the fads, and stays true to the song.

{"text":"Arcade Fire has dropped out of sight in the last several months, so it's nice to see this insanely talented band make their grand reappearance. And their third album \"The Suburbs\" is a rich, retro-flavored expanse of truly transcendent music -- it starts off rather patchily, but soon it becomes a melodic hurricane of shimmering rock'n'roll.\n\nIt starts off rather weakly with the title track, a rather bland piano-rocker. But things pick up with \"Ready to Start,\" which spins shimmering threads of keyboard around gritty earthy chords (\"Businessmen drink my blood\/Like the kids in art school said they would\"). Honestly, this would have made a much better start to the album.\n\nAnd it sets the tone for the rest of the album -- meandering, bluesy rock'n'roll (\"Modern Man,\" \"Month of May\"), the stormy stretches of warbling keyboard and ringing guitars (\"Rococo,\" \"Wasted Hours\"), bittersweet guitar-pop (\"Suburban War\"), the elegant driving rock anthems (\"Empty Rooms,\" \"We Used To Wait\"), and languid indiepop around a catchy core (\"City with No Children\").\n\nThe best songs of all are the two-part experimental ones: \"Half Light Part I\" is an exquisite twinkling little melody, and \"Part II\" is its darkly glittering counterpoint; on the other hand, \"Sprawl (Flatland)\" is a string-soaked, bittersweet song, with \"Sprawl (Mountains Beyond Mountains\" as its discoish companion.\n\nApparently the central theme of \"The Suburbs\" is urban sprawl... which is not exactly a unique concept. But the Arcade Fire doesn't just explore the sprawl of suburbia with its \"dead shopping malls\" and lonely houses, but the loneliness of growing into adulthood and the life of an artist surrounded by \"normal\" people.\n\nAs for the instrumentation, it's a little less indiepop and a little more rock'n'roll -- strong, shifting electric guitars and powerful chords, veiled with shimmering keyboard, strings and piano. And they throw in some brilliant flourishes here and there (the berserk strings in \"Empty Room\"). At the center of all this is Win Butler and Rgine Chassagne -- his falsetto voice murmurs through most of the songs, but is sometimes accompanied by her clear sweet one.\n\nAnd their brilliant lyrical skills are evident in every song -- there are some wicked bits of satire (\"They seem wild but they are so tame\/They're moving towards you with their colors all the same\" -- take that, hipsters!), and exquisite lyricism (\"Now the cities we live in could be distant stars\/And I searched for you in every passing car\").\n\nThe Arcade Fire's \"The Suburbs\" takes a little while to fully warm up, but it ends up being a lonely, bittersweet exploration of an artist's life in suburbia. Brilliance with a couple of lackluster moments.","classification":4,"fold":8}

My most recent listen of Dance Hall Days was less than 28 hours ago when I saw the song featured in my music feed when I was watching the video to Dont Give Up by Peter Gabriel feat. Kate Bush.

{"text":"All controversy about Dylan's faith aside....\n\nThis album is considered to be the best of Bob's gospel albums (with Saved and Shot of Love). The songs here are more varied in style than Saved, and the Christian message is more subtle. It is more of a rock album with Christian lyrics, rather than a Christian rock album. This does not make it any better or worse than Saved or Shot of Love.\n\nFrom the medium grind of Gotta Serve Somebody to the reggae of Man Gave Names To All the Animals to the simple beauty of I Believe In You, Bob runs a gamut of styles and it all works. The back-up musicians mostly stay out of the way, which sometimes works for Bob and sometimes it doesn't. Here it does.

{"text":"Renowned director Lars Von Trier's stroke of genius in making his 2000 film DANCER IN THE DARK was to cast Iceland-born avant-pop siren Bjork in the central role and then enlist her aid in composing and performing a series of musical numbers for the movie. In the film, Bjork's character Selma lives an unrelentingly hard life as a single mother and factory worker who is quickly going blind. The film's songs come from Selma's inner world, where she (and the audience) find respite from all the harshness of reality.\nBjork's compositions, with orchestral arrangements from Vince Mendoza, hang together on their own quite nicely. Catherine Deneuve (Bjork's co-star) and Radiohead's Thom Yorke make effective vocal cameos, but Bjork's voice and music are the central focus. As we hear the industrial sounds of the factory turn into the rhythm of a song, or follow Bjork's oddly intuitive melodic leaps through a dreamlike haze of strings, it becomes clear that her idiosyncratic writing style adapts quite well to the cinematic milieu. As usual, her uniquely entrancing singing style stands out above almost all else.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Here's the 2nd \"crossover\" album by Croatian cello players Luka Sulic and Stjepan Hauser. (I haven't heard the first one but - on Amazon - folks seemed to like it.\nThese guys became a big hit - apparently - when they appeared on the TV series \"Glee\" with Glee star Naya Rivera and there is a YouTube going viral.\nOn this album the two cellists have lots of big name company as guests. The first track, \"Oh Well\" is the early Fleetwood Mac hit  (written by Peter Green, when he was in the band). Elton John is the guest here and he provides vocals to the electric cellos. It gets the album off to a great start. There more pop (hits by Rhianna, Cher and The Police) and rock (AC\/DCs hard edged \"Highway to Hell\" - with guest Steve Vai  on guitar and Muse's \"Supermassive Black Hole) than I cared for and it's certainly like nothing else on Sony Masterworks (the label). An interesting track is the 6-minute version of \"Clocks\" (the Coldplay hit) with the cellists and Lang Lang on piano. Others I liked were the one original by the pair (\"Orient Express\"), the Italian song \"The Book of Love\" with Italian superstar Zucchero, and the closer, \"Benedictus\" (the dou accompanied by two keyboard players. This last track is the closest to a \"classical piece\". The 46 -minute CD is accompanied by an 8 panel booklet with more photos than info (basically the track listing). In one of the four photos of the duo they are shown with acoustic cellos; the others show them bearing electric ones. I can't tell for sure if the acoustic ones were used on the album, but if they were, it was sparse.\n\nThis is a fun album to listen to at least once, and I'm sure there will be a fan base, but those who are not fans of electric guitar riffs should be aware that electric cello riffs sound pretty much the same.\nAnother album that will get a boost from Youtube videos.\n\nI hope you found this review both informative and helpful.\n\nSteve Ramm\n\"Anything Phonographic\"","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"To be honest, I really wasn't thrilled with this album after the first listen.  However, I always post my reviews after the third or fourth listen.  I think you must give an album a chance before posting your review.  Now I can honestly say that I think this is a good album...not her best work, but good...the songs grew on me.  Brandy has gone back to her previous sound; which is working with long time producer Rodney Jerkins.  The album reminds me of \"Full Moon\" and \"Never Say Never\".  Aphrodisiac was a good album also, but it was a different sound for Brandy.  I thought that Brandy and Timberland didn't make a good combination.  One thing I can say about Aphrodisiac is that I think it was Brandy's best album vocally.  Some producers and artists are meant to make great music together and also make up a dynamic team.  There's Janet Jackson and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis; Jermaine Dupri & Lil Bow Wow, Usher & Mariah Carey; Eve & Swizz Beats; Rich Harrison & Amerie; Aaliyah & Timberland; Ciara & Jazze Pha; Monica & Dallas Austin, and Toni Braxton & Babyface.  Just like those mentioned, there's Brandy & Rodney Jerkins.\n\nMy favorite tracks are:\nThe Definition\nWarm It Up\nLong Distance\nShattered Hear\nTrue\nTorn Down\n\nBecause this album received little or no promotion, it only sold 73,000 the first week.  Brandy is a veteran in the music business and I think she doesn't get the recognition she deserves.  I've seen on one review where she is being compared to Beyonce.  Then again, every female artist is now being compared to Beyonce. Why???  Beyonce is a great entertainer and she dazzles on stage, but she's not the first and she's won't be the last.  Where Beyonce is now, Brandy has been there and have done a whole lot more.  Not hating on Beyonce, just think she's overrated.\n\nOverall, \"Human\" is a good album and it's worth the purchase.","classification":3,"fold":8}
{"text":"Lucinda Williams has made a career out of doing things her way.  Her past is full of legendary confrontations with record label execs and producers who did not support her vision of what her music should be.  With the success of CAR WHEELS ON A GRAVEL ROAD, that relentless fight finally paid dividends as the commerce finally caught up with her art.  Rather than repeating CAR WHEELS formula over and over, Lucinda left behind the Southern travel logs and delved into more emotional material.  The songs on ESSENCE and WORLD WITHOUT TEARS not only dug into the deeper depths of her psyche, but also loosened up musically, mixing more rock and hard blues into her Americana palette.  WEST seems like a logical extension of the two previous albums emotionally, while moving into new territory musically.\n\nProduced by veteran Hal Willner, WEST takes a quantum leap from her previous releases by taking arrangements far beyond where her previous music went.  Saving the vocals and guitar from demos, the songs are built up layer by layer with strings and keyboards and various session players including Jim Keltner and Bill Frisell to create music quite different from her past efforts.  The good news is that the production is not camouflage for weak material.  Williams has delivered a solid set of tunes, at times harrowing, as she pokes at he emotional scabs of broken relationships and the death of her mother.  I can see how this material will put some off, when they are looking for material closer to CAR WHEELS regional sketches.  Still, you cannot deny the solid songwriting on songs like WHERE IS MY LOVE, WORDS (a ode to her poetic muse) and ARE YOU ALRIGHT?  Other songs like UNSUFFER ME, RESCUE and the talking blues\/rap of WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THAT move into new territory, to my ears at least, with great success.\n\nI'm glad that there are artists like Lucinda Williams who choose to challenge themselves and their fans with each new output of work.  Those that take the ride with WEST will be rewarded with a CD of solid songs and performances that rank with the best of Lucinda's previous work.  WEST seems to me to be the end of a trilogy of work that includes her post CAR WHEELS work.  If you're not a big fan of the previous two albums, you'll more than likely be disappointed with this new one.  In that case there is always the back catalog to enjoy.  I'll be interested to see what new directions she chooses in the future, and will no doubt, continue to enjoy this CD for years to come.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library.  With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing.  It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.  Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was fairly cheap on Amazon....69 cents, I think?  But most of the songs I download are free..  Thats right!  Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too.  In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.  Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great!  At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free\n\nFREE ALBUMS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Albums by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Sometimes you can tell by the packaging of a CD - and its title - what kind of music you might expect to hear. This is very true of David Wahler's second album, A Star Danced. The elaborate and elegant digipak design casts a charming-looking bear dancing under the stars, and the music conveys the same celestial, wondrous feel.\n\nComposed and performed entirely by Wahler on keyboards and synthesizers, with a guest appearance by guitarist Brent Gunter on \"The Seeds of Time,\" the music is a magical mix of sampled guitars, basses, drums, percussion, horns, and strings, resulting in a kaleidoscope of sound that exudes ethereal ambiance and cosmic sweep anchored by strong themes and melodic hooks. This is the perfect soundtrack for a long night drive under a starry sky.\n\nThe opening and closing tracks set and summate the tone for this sonically mystical album. \"Quest\" and its concluding reprise literally sound like a synthesis of Miles Davis and Herb Alpert soloing over layered textures by Vangelis and Tangerine Dream. The result is pure aural bliss.\n\nThe quality of the compositions, performances, and sounds recalls similar keyboard\/synthesizer artists such as Michael Stribling, Pat Metheny collaborator Lyle Mays, Genesis member Tony Banks, and Miami Vice composer Jan Hammer.\n\nIf you do listen to this under the night sky, the stars will seem as if they are dancing, and so will your senses.","classification":5,"fold":8}

This is a fun song is about living a carefree life drinking beer and looking at pretty women.\n\n  My other track is \"Come Back Song\".  This song is about trying to get back together with someone.  I love his vocals on this song.  The mandolin playing by Sam Bush is excellent on this song.\n\n \"Might Get Lucky\" is a song about trying to rekindle the romance in a relationship while hoping to get lucky.  A lot of married people will relate to the lyrics of this song.\n\n  \"Southern State of Mind\" and \"In A Big Way\" are two songs about what a huge influence growing up in the South has on his personality.  I love these two tunes.  \"Whiskey And You\"  is the prettiest song about alcohol I have ever heard.  I love the musical arrangements on the song \"The Craziest Thing\". All the instruments on this song are excellent.  I love the piano playing by Gordon Mote and banjo playing by Bela Fleck.\n\n  \"We All Fall Down\" is a reminder that people make mistakes and fall short sometimes.  The mandolin playing is played beautifully on this song.  \"I Got Nothin\" is another song about trying to prevent a loved one from leaving.  The lyrics of this song sound very honest.  I like it a lot.  This is a song about learning lessons throughout life.  This is a very upbeat and fun song.\n\n\"She's Beautiful\" is a song learning to love the inner beauty of a woman.

Now, he is trying to follow up what made him in the markings of a brilliant singer\/songwriter. But his latest single actually doesn't hit the mark and instead misses the notes. Sing off of his second album X, isn't actually a step in the right direction. Instead, the song feels more like a step backwards from the songs he had struck gold with. I really found the edgier vibe from him to be more like a step backwards that keeping his feet firmly on the ground. Perhaps he could've done a bit less of a edgier vibe from the song, and just make it with him and guitar it would've worked. But I would go back and hear more from The A Team at heart.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"There are two aspects of this download that keep me from recommending it.\n\nFirst would be the random order of the various tracks. They jump all over the place, with an aria from one work, a few tracks from another, etc. It might not be bothersome if you're new to classical music, but it seems awfully disjointed if you're a more-than-average fan of classical music.\n\nSecond - and most egregious - is the recording of the \"Messiah\" that makes up the majority of tracks in this download. This is simply one of the limpest, most-lifeless, bordering-on-amateur recordings I have ever had the displeasure of hearing, and that hearing covers just shy of 50 years worth of listening to classical music.\n\nThe very first downbeat to the opening Sinfonia is a train wreck, with instruments sneaking in at different times. The orchestra is OK once it gets going, but it's a rather monochromatic sound. The chorus is the worst kind of neutered, wimpy singing that gets featured in the very worst of HIP performances and recordings.\n\nBut the real problem with this recording lies with the vocal soloists, whose singing doesn't rise to the level of accomplishment one can often encounter at high school variety shows. The singing barrels over into embarrassing when the soloists attempt to get artsy and ornament their singing, hilariously so in the bass recitative \"Thus saith the Lord,\" where our musically challenged soloist decides to add a shake to his voice every time he sings the word \"shake.\" Are you kidding me? Hey, why not also spit every time you sing the word \"sea\" and fake a dry voice when singing the words \"dry land?\" This is amateur hour writ large.\n\nGood points? The recorded sound is excellent! But what good is that when the recordings themselves can't be taken seriously?\n\nAvoid this.\n\nBTW - if you're looking for a really good recording of \"Messiah\" as an under-$10 download, then look no further than Johannes Somary's Vanguard recording of the piece. It's currently available as part of three different Vanguard \"Big Box\" downloads - Big Box Handel (ASIN: B00BK3LPFU), the Big Handel Oratorio Box and Big Box Christmas (ASIN: B00A2KV7XW). That \"Messiah\" recording has it all - great soloists and chorus, a very good orchestra and an interpretation that is - for lack of a better term - mainstream, yet unique and engaging, and good analogue sound.","classification":1,"fold":8}

On his fifth solo release Tank continues to provide slow jams for the ladies to great effect.  Lead by the singles Compliments, Next Breath, Lonely feat. Chris Brown and the self titled track, this is R&B at it's finest. The highlight on the album for me though was Your One, where Tank compares himself to being a dollar bill for a stripper. All in all a fine album and I look forward to the next one.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"around the time I was 8 years old was when I first heard the song smooth criminal by Michael Jackson. I admit that smooth criminal by Michael Jackson has to be one of my favorite  Michael Jackson songs even though it does not get hardly any radio airplay like his other songs and my guess that the meaning of the song is controversial in itself. The online music video to the song is very good. From my perspective, smooth criminal by Michael Jackson plays with the idea of how innocence can be hardened and transform into something else completely under corrupt and\/or hardened circumstances.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Mary J. Blige is absolutely ADORED by many of my friends.  They love and appreciate her because she never tried to be \"Hollywood.\"  She has been that same girl from New York that she was when she made her debut in 1992 and for that, we love her!  She was never surreptitious about her ordeals with drugs, abusive relationships and family drama.  The pain that she has endured is felt all throughout her music, which is something else her supporters appreciate.  She is definitely one of the most sincere and real people in the industry of entertainment; there's no arguing that point.  Her album, \"Growing Pains\" is a great offering.  It doesn't have any songs that are quite as memorable as, say, \"I'm Goin' Down\", \"Sweet Thing\", \"Love No Limit\", \"Be Happy\", or \"Not Gon Cry\" (I could go on for days, she has a slew of sensational songs!!!), but it is a good listen and worth purchasing.\n\n Mary Jane Blige has this unique way of delivering songs; that is, to me, what makes her music so listenable and memorable.  It is not easy to explain, but once you listen to her best songs, you'll understand.  With this album, her delivery is still as it has always been.  \"Talk to Me\" is a prime example of my previous explanation.  She does a nice job executing this track.  She extends her voice quite a bit here, and I enjoyed listening.  Even her faster tracks are heartfelt, for example, \"Just Fine.\"  This song was released to radio, and though it took a few listens to lure me in, I was eventually taken in by this track.  The beat and hook are infectious.  It's one of the best moments on \"Growing Pains.\"  In short, this song is about a woman who is truly confident with being herself and is not about to change because she's \"fine.\" (I suppose that could mean \"fine\" as in mood and\/or physical appearance, take it how you want.)  Someone strongly suggested that I listen to \"Stay Down\" and I am so happy I listened to him!  I listen to that song a lot because, lyrically, it is beautiful.  This song is about staying with your mate through the bad times because good times are sure to come and overpower those harder times.  Those who hear this song are sure to gain something from it.  This album is a bit flawed in a few places.  \"Smoke\" is the weakest moment on the album.  The production is not good, the lyrics are just alright; collectively, it's just not a good track.  Usher shows up for \"Shake Down\" and does a good job, but this track doesn't stand out.  Everything about this track sits on the average mark.\n\n R&B lovers, Mary lovers, and lovers of music, what are you waiting for?  Go get it!  This woman is a true artist and she exhibits that on this album.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"Stay Down\"\n2. \"Just Fine\"\n3. \"Work in Progress (Growing Pains)\"\n4. \"Til the Morning\"\n5. \"Come to Me (Peace)\"","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Mariah Carey knows what the people like (well, usually). Most importantly, she knows how to take contemporary trends and graft them onto what she does best - solid, melodic r&b and pop with expressive, expansive vocals.\n\n\"Obsessed\" largely nails this, and with its gutsy attitude commands more attention, at least immediately, than previous singles \"Touch My Body\" and \"It's Like That.\" It also firmly silences any detractors who chastize Carey for releasing soundalike lead singles; her last bunch of them could not sound less alike, and this one is a particular departure for her.\n\nHowever, while \"Obsessed\" may be precision-tooled to ignite water cooler gossip with its laugh-out-loud jibes at Eminem (\"You're a mom and pop\/I'm a corporation\" is a line likely to be remembered for some time) it is also unrelatable to the general public and, unlike her strongest hits of this decade, including even \"Touch My Body,\" offers essentially no moment to let her voice propel above the drum machines and studio magic. Given her moniker of The Voice, this may dismay some listeners who erroneously pine for a return to the fuller-voiced but far less interesting Sony-driven Mariah of the early to mid '90s.\n\nVocals and relatibility aside, however, \"Obsessed\" is a solid piece of strong pop and a welcome taste for September's full-length album \"Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel,\" Carey's 11th studio LP. With witty lyrics and catchy chorus, it is sure to keep burning up playlists until the album hits stores.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"I knew that I was getting something different with this Jewel...and how would that work out?  It is most definitely her beautiful voice and flair for some whimsical and fun lyrics that save this album that is musically not in her tone nor fit her style very well.  I appreciate Jewel trying something new and I also am glad she got it out of her system and didn't find the need to go back to this as this style of music and production doesn't fit her folksy shape and leanings.  A big part of her draw is her earthy, grounded guitar and other natural instrumental sounds; you won't find much of that here.  This synth-pop-techno music strips away some of her soul.  Still, even if the style is beneath her her voice still is as lovely as ever, even beneath and through so much digitization.\n\n1) Stand: it's okay.  Starting us off with Jewel's voice front and center as uninspired, syncopated beats and some buzzes chirp here and there.  \"Reach\" would have been an appropriate title as she is reaching for something different here and this song sets the tone for the album pretty well.\n2) Run 2 U: her lovely,soft voice saves a song without musical importance.\n3) Intuition: Singing twice and three times over her own voice and some fun namedropping in the lyrics with a buzzy chorus lifts this otherwise forgettable piece.\n4) Leave the Lights On: Now here's something that starts off a little more interesting with some brassy woodwinds and a bluesy style.  Unfortunately when Jewel gets to the chorus the song loses steam but this is the most interesting song of the CD so far.\n5) 2 Find U: Weak.\n6) Fragile Heart: A bit slow with a country guitar twang slowly plucked.  Too slow, though.\n7) Doin' Fine: \"We are what everyone wants to be.\"  We are doin' fine.  Buried in the middle of the record the song is rather okay.\n8) 2 Become 1: The music is much more engaging and natural.  This feels like a Jewel song and could be on any one of her albums (minus the way she is \"spells\" the song title...).\n9) Haunted: A seductive and creepy song.  Totally cool and different.  Uh, and kinda sensuous.  Jewel's moaning at the end of the song is...well, let's just say that I'm glad that it doesn't go on too long.\n10) Sweet Temptation: Sounding much more like a Shakira pop song this one actually pretty much works and is much better than any of the first three songs.\n11) Yes U Can: This one might just make you dance.  Again, a love and sex song that is both a joinder and a cautious observation.  It is minorly infectious.\n12) U & Me = Love: Dance pop bubblegum fluff.  Blech.\n13) America: Overly easy political thoughts are dispensed.  It's okay, unless you're tired of hearing popsters and others bagging on America.  Not nearly one of her best social observation songs (probably because it's so politicized).\n14) Becoming: Lyrically well-suited to the empty dance-pop genre, Jewel witnesses her own \"becoming\" with her heart.  Ahhh, isn't that nice.  Maudlin stuff.\n\nAs you might have guessed this isn't my favorite Jewel album.  But there is at least one gem on here and a few other songs that work.  If you're interested in what Jewel has to offer I'd highly suggest starting elsewhere (personally, I'd direct you to \"This Way\") and if you like your techno-dance-pop I'd look somewhere else too.","classification":3,"fold":8}

Just by my first listen of its lead single, \"Life Itself\" I could tell.

If you're hoping for the trippy psychedelic sound that was going on with their debut album, \"Zaba\" then you may be pretty disappointed. Not that this record completely abandons the psychedelic sound 100%, as it appears in small cases such as the song \"Youth\" but you can tell the band was trying to head in a new direction with this album. For what it's trying to be, I would say this album is okay but it's nothing that is going to blow anyone away, especially if you're hoping for more of what was going on with their first album.","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"On his 3rd album, Australias Kevin Parker has removed the rock element, opting for a lush soundscape of bubbling, kaleidoscopic pop shimmer.  Its a brave and dangerous move that mostly works.  The albums title, Currents, is a perfect fit for the sound, which has the sort of unpredictable, wavy ebb & flow thats only found below the surface, deep down where few people venture.  In this dark, liquid environment, club tentacles writhe & dance to a beat of mysteriously skewed origin.  The warm, orchestral, multifarious production technique results in the kind of eyes-glazed relaxed absorption brought on by lying underneath a soft waterfall on ecstasy, while neon birds paint the sky with color-trail clouds.  Currents is a radiantly chilled-out psychedelic eruption, colored by subtle tweaks of gently twisted beauty.  Recommended.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"A beautiful restoration with stunning bonus tracks of the strangely overlooked Peggy Lee masterpiece from 1974 capture the fascinating legendary lady in peak form, mesmerizing title song produced and arranged by Paul McCartney.  Fresh from a dramatic weight loss and looking like a million bucks, Peggy Lee was ready to go when she signed Atlantic Records to record a soulful set of great contemporary songs.  Peggy Lee went deep inside, laid down a stunning vocal on the great \"Let's Love\" which should have been a huge hit but shamefully received no airplay upon its release. Next is a spirited soulful version of Melissa Manchester's \"He Is The One\" with a thrilling background gospel chorus with Peggy leading the way with a superb vocal.  Sensuous and funky on a playful \"Easy Evil\", torchy and illuminating \"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight\", clearly Miss Lee is in peak form and very inspired!  A fresh funky arrangement make evergreen \"Always\" a delight while \"You Make Me Feel Brand New\" becomes a tour-de-force, making this the definitive version of this timeless soulful classic. Hot rhythm track sets gospel spiritual \"Sweet Lov'liness\" on fire while a haunting Peggy Lee original \"The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter\" is simply gorgeous.  Soulful seduction make \"Sweet Talk\" a quiet storm classic which should have been a huge hit and mesmerizing achingly gorgeous Henry Mancini \"Sometimes\" is a sentimental classic having a special feel all its own.  Bonus tracks are wonderful discoveries with \"I Am His Lady\" the best ever version of this soft-jazz treat.  A ragtime arrangement make the Peggy Lee original \"I Wanna Be Seduced\" great fun and another Peggy original \"The Nickel Ride\" is a stunning classic that is naked and haunting.  This unique original has Peggy brilliantly accompanied by piano only and the result is another great song that echos  Grammy Winner \"Is That All There Is?\". Peggy must have wondered \"Is That All There Is?\" when this great release was received with such shocking indifference, robbing public exposure to a great work and Peggy acclaim she clearly deserved. Closing is a great circus like arrangement for a stirring \"Let's Keep Dancing\" which was to be Peggy's last major studio production and a winner it is!  This great song featured in \"Sharky's Machine\" soundtrack should have been a big hit and would have been in better musical times than the musically directionless early eighties!.  Now if only Capitol Records would release the great 70's \"Where Did They Go\" and the classic \"Norma Delores Egstrom\", both featuring the iconic Peggy Lee in peak form, fans will be happy this legendary singer is finally given some justice for her great but sadly overlooked 70's work.  For those who enjoy great singers in a sublime setting in peak form, do not miss this classic collection, this level of greatness will never happen again...special Limited Numbered Edition & value will soar when no longer available...Thank You Peggy Lee for years of great entertainment and sublime vocals & classy lady RIP","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Not to be Captain Obvious but this album does not represent what TSFH is famous for and is not their typical \"trailer music\". However, this album is very beautiful and adds to the eclectic music of TSFH. I want to point out that Thomas Bergersen composed this entire album but it was released as a TSFH album since many of these songs were released on previous industry albums. I would not recommend buying this if you are new to TSFH as it does not represent what they are most famous for. However, I would recommend buying this if you prefer softer pieces and songs that almost sound like pop music (I think Thomas created a new genre of music with this album - \"epic pop\", listen to \"My Freedom\" and you'll see what I mean), or if you have everything else from TSFH and want more. This is definitely a must if you are a diehard TSFH fan. If you are new to TSFH I would recommend Battlecry, Vanquish, Illusions, or Sun. The former two if you want epic courageous music, and the latter two if you primarily want epic emotional\/beautiful music.\nHighlights of this album include: Miracles, Compass (especially the bonus track), My Freedom, Fountain of Life, Color the Sky, Breath of Cold Air, Wind Queen, Lost in Las Vegas.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"American VI: Ain't No Grave is advertised as the final album in Johnny Cash's American series.  As such, it is a solid, moving collection that brings the critically acclaimed series to an end.\n\nCash's voice comes across fairly strong on songs such as Kris Kristofferson's \"For the Good Times\" and the country staple \"Satisfied Mind.\"  On others, like \"Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound,\" he sounds older than a man in his early seventies. It works to paint a picture of Johnny Cash near the end: frail, ailing, but still commanding, still Cash.\n\nThe musical backing deserves positive notice, as well.  It is delicate, beautiful, and totally captivating while never overwhelming Cash's vocals.  I believe that the arrangement of \"For the Good Times\" on this album is the best that I have heard.\n\nMany of these songs are well-known, and some, like \"Cool Water\" seemed a little too obvious to me at first.  However, there is not one weak track on this album; listening to Cash sing \"Cool Water\" actually served to remind me that the man was one of our great folksingers and folklorists.  The overtly Christian numbers (\"Ain't No Grave,\" \"I Corinthians 15:55\") testify to Johnny Cash's staunch faith in his God.\n\nIt is a great album that can present an artist with humanity and dignity.  American VI: Ain't No Grave does that for Johnny Cash, one of music's greatest voices.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Mudcrutch 2 is, in most ways, I think, an improvement over their previous album. The loose, Southern rock and folk sound pairs well with the songs each of the band members has written. A number of the songs sound like mid-period Bob Dylan in the melodies and phrasing, contributing further to my sense of this being more akin to the Traveling Wilburys than a Heartbreakers record. This is due to the fact that different band members take lead vocals on the songs they wrote, as well as an overarching sense that this album is meant to be fun. There are songs like \"Welcome to Hell\" that I would probably identify as filler on a Heartbreakers record but that feel appropriate and fun in the Mudcrutch context.\n\nThe best songs, though (the one's I streamed nearly constantly on NPR's album preview in the week before this was released) are the ones where Petty is just plain being himself, like \"I Forgive It All,\" a truly beautiful song. \"Hungry No More\" and \"Dreams of Flying\" are another pair that could easily have been reserved for the Heartbreakers. (The non-Petty-written \"Beautiful World\" is another standout for me, with that mix of optimism and defiance that characterized many classic Heartbreakers songs and albums.)\n\nThe album comfortably mixes genres from country, folk, and rock, and the playing is excellent throughout. There's no doubt that the musicians were feeling good and having fun with this music, and the result is an enjoyable listen from start to finish.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"It is always sad whenever someone young and talented dies at a early age. For this, it was a deviating shocker. Hearing about the tragic death of Malcolm Young, one of the musical virtuosos of AC\/DC, was just a devastating shock. Hard to believe he passed away after leaving the group 3 years ago, and privately battling with dementia that crippled him. Now with his death, he joins his musical brother Bon Scott, who died over 35 years ago, after he had long-fronted the group. But with Brian Johnson taking the helm, AC\/DC hit their commercial peak with Back In Black. Through that album, AC\/DC had a lot of great songs through that album. But nevertheless, the group had a lot of wonderful anthems, and You Shook Me All Night Long remains one of AC\/DC's finest. The song is a real feel-good boogie rhythm that still ignites today from the heart and soul of the music. Whenever I hear this year, I think of all the joy AC\/Dc brought to a mass appeal that no rock group had ever been able to do before. Now, with Malcolm Young passing on, his legacy is enshrined with some of guitar's greatest heroes like Jimi Hendrix and Chicago's Terry Kath and B.B. King. May Malcolm Young be forever remembered, shaking us all night long.\n\nMalcolm Young: 1953-2017\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"During my MTV days, Steve Winwood's big 80's splash with songs from Back In The High Life didn't go unnoticed by me.  After discovering that album and Chronicles, I had the good fortune of someone loaning me her tape of Arc Of A Diver, which I copied.  My interest in his second solo album was due to the upbeat \"While You See A Chance.\"  Winwood's sweeping organ-like synths open his first Top Ten solo hit-it reached #7 in 1981-along with the accompanying lively piano that gives it a radio-friendly beat, with some downright introspective lyrics on if one is truly free from the past and ready to take another road one blue morning with a gray wind blowing.  I find myself enjoying this song more than \"Higher Love.\"\n\nThe title track reached #48 on the singles chart, a slower midpaced affair.  \"Spanish Dancer\" along the same languid lines, may be an example of what many called \"lazy music\" to describe Winwood's early solo stuff.  This song was included on the Chronicles compilation made to cash in on the success of Back in The High Life.\n\nI wonder why \"Second-Hand Woman\" wasn't a chart-topper, as it's a more lively affair with Winwood's trademark keyboards set to a disco beat.  Some racy imagery is present with the title woman being \"a slot machine to take my dime\" but it is quite the danceable track.  The same holds true for the near eight minute on-the-run opus \"Night Train\" with its funky beats mixed with guitars, particularly a solo around the six minute mark, and the usual keyboards.  A single mix of this could've done well, but alas.\n\nTwo non-singles in particular strike me and both are slow songs.  They are \"Slowdown Sundown.\"  A wistful ballad, calling wine that \"glassful of memories\"  and something to soothe the balm of yesterday's pain.  The tempo goes up during the bridge, which is a toast to whoever can understand this madness of life.  The closing track \"Dust\" is the other song which also deals with memories one wants so bad to go away, in this case meaning time with a woman, yet how to deal with a love that's gone, but a friendship that still remains?  Indeed, \"a feather duster is no substitute for the real thing,\" meaning time, \"the universal healer.\"  That brings to mind the Dr. Who quote \"the sands of time wash us all clean.\"\n\nMellow, but not \"lazy music\" as was described by some, Arc Of A Diver shows that Winwood still had some life in him following Traffic.  Considering the turn-of-the-decade changes going on in the music scene, i.e. punk and new wave, it's fortunate that Arc found an audience.  And Winwood played all the instruments on the album, much like Prince had done his own debut For You.  Despite having only seven songs, Arc benefits from a consistent synth-keyboard style, upbeat dance tunes to reflective ballads.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Despite not being a huge Barenaked Ladies fan (the only other songs of their's I listen to on a regular basis are \"One Week\" and their version of \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\"), I really enjoy this song.  It's an upbeat yet mellow acoustic number that's funny and adorable, with some hilarious speech interludes that seem entirely unscripted and are all the funnier for this.  In fact, much of this song feels off the cuff and impromptu, though not in a bad way -- the seeming improvisation just makes it even more enjoyable.\n\nI'll definitely be listening to more by this band, as both this song and \"One Week\" prove that they're an oddball but highly enjoyable group.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Styx released their first studio album of new material since 1983's Multi-Platinum selling album Kilroy Was Here entitled Edge of the Century in October of 1990.\nI first bought this album in December of 1993 on cassette on a whim and Edge of the Century proved to me that Styx could survive without Tommy Shaw (they did five albums before Shaw joined from 1972-75 including their A&M debut Equinox and Styx II). Part of my point is THEY GOT ALONG during this period! Don't get me wrong, Tommy added a lot to the band, but they made it work before he came along and did well without him. New member guitarist\/singer\/songwriter Glen Burtnik wrote great songs on this album and his voice was reminiscent to Tommy's thus keeping the Styx \"sound\" intact.\nThe opening first single \"Love is the Ritual\" is Glen's best song on the album but the song flopped as a single on the pop charts although it did hit #9 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart meaning rock radio gave this track a good spin. I think \"Homewrecker\" was one of James \"JY\" Young's best rockers. It was co-written by keyboard player\/singer\/songwriter Dennis DeYoung (whose keyboards and synthesizers rocked on this song (it's a damn shame that bad blood kept Tommy and JY from including his work on much of Brave New World. They screwed up Everything is Cool by almost muting Dennis whilst Dennis was ill and what a shame, it could have so much better)).\nDennis wrote some some of his best tracks since his Desert Moon solo effort from 1984 on Edge of the Century and his voice got better with age. Dennis wrote the massive #3 hit from the spring of 1991 \"Show Me The Way\" for his son Matthew while Matthew was experiencing the trials and tribulations of being an adolescent transitioning from child to adolescent to teen. At that time, he needed encouragement, love and support from his parents. As all parents know there's no book or rules on parenting. Occasionally we need to ask for guidance from a higher power. Dennis put those feelings to a song, and Show Me The Way was born out of those feelings. Nothing like that on BNW. The Top 30 hit \"Love at First Sight\" is a great mid-tempo track. I can't believe that anyone who is a true Styx fan from WAY BACK can trash \"Carrie Ann\". Dennis wrote this song to express his love for his daughter of the same name. I'm guessing that the people who trash this song never had a daughter.\nThe rocking title track, Glen and Dennis' acoustic masterpiece \"All in a Day's Work\", \"World Tonight\" and the closing jazzy-meets-bluesy \"Back to Chicago\" are stellar tracks as is the re-make of \"Not Dead Yet\" proving Styx could rock when counted.\nEdge of the Century almost went Gold when released but A&M were then owned by PolyGram when the album was released and were more interested in people like Janet Jackson and Extreme on their roster and stopped promoting the album when sales were close to Gold. It would eventually hit the plateau (the last studio album to date to do so folks).\nUnfortunately, this was original drummer John Panozzo's swan song with the band as he would pass away in 1996. His brother, bass player Chuck did well on this album as well.\nHighly recommended!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Already, I-Empire is one of the best albums of the year (if not THE best).  Of all the CD's I've listened to this year, this one, by far, is very optimistic and uplifting, to say the least.  The anthemic, 80's synth-pop, stadium-rock sound works very well here.  And if it does sound formulaic, so be it!  Very heartfelt and inspirational too!  Tom DeLonge has definitely come a long way from his Blink-182 days, and I'm all the more glad for it!  Instead of the usual bratty, toilet humor, we get mature, \"reach for the sky\" sentiments, that is, keep going, no matter what happens to you in life.  Honestly, I think that's what we need more nowadays.  By the way, forget about that Rolling Stone critic who gave this fine CD only 2 1\/2 stars.  According to the review, \"Blink-182 guitarist is all grown up and synth-poppy.  But is that a good thing?\"  I certainly think so!\n\n** ADDENDUM **\nAngels & Airwaves' new album, LOVE, is already available as a FREE download.

UK after about a week it arrived here in the states. Outer box crushed to all bejesus but the Amazon record mailer inside was unscathed, the record and outer jacket were flawless. Having heard firsthand what poop the US version sounded like, I opted to go with the U.K. and brother let me tell you!!! Not a skip scuff scratch, click, pop. Nothing but the sweet Mustaine balls out rythm tone. A nice quiet background, nice heavy flat record, drilled dead center. Beautiful cover art. Fantastic album.

It has that bass line at the end that I just LOVE to hear. God IS amazing. There is also still hint of New G in there. It still sounds like a CHOIR, not a Praise Team.

I think Ed Sheeran's \"Thinking Out Loud\" is a textbook example of why music executives keep churning out cookie-cutter, formulaic songs; people completely eat it up.  The formula for \"Thinking Out Loud\" is classic.  It is the easily manipulative 'deeply sensitive' love ballad which, unlike Sheeran's other ballad style songs, does not have any dark or edgy lyrics (like \"A Team\" or \"Lego House\").  It is simply a cheesy schmaltz-fest.  Combine the music and lyrics with a very sappy video of Sheeran and his on-screen love ballroom dancing, and you have formulaic 'awwwwwww' song that listeners repeatedly show they are suckers for.  It can be somewhat overlooked if it is a good song.  Alas, \"Thinking Out Loud\" just isn't that good.","classification":2,"fold":8}

{"text":"Nina Simone has always been difficult to classify although this album is pretty close to a straight ahead R&B \/ Soul outin with some vocal pop thrown in.  The only nod to jazz is the Porgy & Bess number \"My Man's Gone Now\".  Although Ms. Simone can tend to be self indulgent at times, she reins in that tendency here with a selection of songs (4 are self penned) that really fit the Blues theme which is very fitting to her style and persona.  The arrangements are also excellent with a tight band that supports but does not overwhelm the songs - no strings, no brass.\nMy favorite thing here is a rollicking barrelhouse version of \"House of the Rising Sun\", completely unlike the version made famous by The Animals.  While not everything works as well as that, there is never any doubt about NS's commitment to the material.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"With the opening guitar riff of the Generation X anthem \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", Nirvana fired a shot that woke up the music world.  With Kurt Cobain's apathetic lyrics and actual melodies amongst a punk like musical barrage, Nirvana touched a chord with teenagers and 20-somethings of the time. Songs like \"Lithium\", \"Drain You\", \"Come As You Are\" & \"Breed\" spoke of the malaise and indifference that was felt at the time.  The baby boomers of the 60's were growing old and their kids didn't quite feel the love, peace and happiness they felt.  \"Territorial Pissings\" shows where the line was drawn as the song opens with Kris Novoselic mockingly singing the hippie anthem \"Get Together\" before launching into machine gun burst of nilhistic rock.  The music may seem old today as so many band's rode the grunge gravy train, but when it was released in 1991, Nevermind was as innovative as any record ever released and it was to the 1990's music scene what Sgt.

I'd discovered just a handful of the Deller Consort's renaissance vocal works on a long out of print Vanguard box set, \"Folk Songs and Minstrelsy\". While this collection includes no songs about alehouses, the traditional Christmas subject matter fits their style perfectly. It is renaissance material such as this which distinguishes this compilation from the many that are centered around retreads of Nutcracker tinkling.\n\nThis collection may not be for those whose point of reference is \"Jingle Bell Rock\" or the latest holiday product by Nashville's drug store hatboy of the moment. But for those who appreciate classical, vocal music, or musical history, or those who are simply adventurous, this gigantic set trumps previous years' 99-100-etc. offerings from other labels. The review by B. R. Fox goes into more detail but suffice it to say that this album and the Pink Martini Christmas album will be getting a lot of play around the house this season.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"You know what to expect from Elton John, some nice, lush ballads, a few uptempo numbers and a little bit of rock. Nice melodies, mot so much passion, but a lyrics sheet that, no matter how one tried, could not find a single reference to his sexuality, except Big Dipper.\n\nAnd so 'The Fox' goes, his usual servings of pop, still using self-serving metaphors (But 'The Fox' is a long way to plummet from 'Captain Fantastic' don't ya think?) (And who's fault is this anyway, It's not as if Elton writes the lyrics, or does he?? Did Bernie Taupin really bestowe the crown of 'Captain Fantastic' on Elton, while relegating himself to role of 'Brown dirt cowboy'?)\n\nBut The Fox is a surprise. Although it is not an experimental album, fairly straight-forward, it is still a very inspired album. From the sleazy-journo ode 'Heart's in the right p;ace' to classical music 'Carla Etude' and the all-our rocking opener 'Breaking down barriers', the songs on 'The Fox' are very solid and enjoyable. There is also a lot of diversity here too. Rating 3 1\/2 or 3 3\/4 or something like that, worth rounding up.\n\nBut if you are hoping for a return to his country-rock days; you'll be disappointed, you'll have to wait for the last song and even then you won't get any humility: \"And for mile after mile you'll never see me tire\nYou'll never see me slow down, for a while\n'Cause I am the fox, like it or not\".\nBut who wants humility in their rock music anyway? I DO!! We're a vocal minority but we're growing, yes you'd better be scared!!","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"You have to wonder at this late date what the function is of this 1967-70 Blue Album and its bookend, 1962-66 (Red). Last year we had massive remasters of all the Beatles Albums, English and American, mono and stereo, EMI and Ebbits. The fabs are also now on I-Tunes. The Beatles finally have the digital ubiquity they should have gotten in the mid-1980s.\n\nThe Red and the Blue albums were issued in 1973, three years after the Beatles broke up. To me, the idea of a \"hits\" package for the best band, the true eighth wonder, is antithetical. Even in 1963, the group was making albums that held together as such when most were just slapping singles together surrounded by filler By 1964 they were advancing, using Bossa Nova and by 1965 they were soaking in Dylan. Every album was a leap, so you really can't divide the fabs into early and late periods.\n\nAnd you really do need to hear every sound of every album--none of us will--to understand rock and Western Music itself. That is a lifetime undertaking. There really are no short cuts with the Beatles: if you get Red and Blue, you may think you found an `inexpensive way to learn about this band, but you are going to wind up thinking that you wasted money in the end. You'll be buying every album very soon anyhow. These sets are a good overview, but in 2010, there are quicker ways to do get this.\n\nTrust me, get these sets if you are a complete collector, but if you are just starting out, you might as well just get, say, Please Please Me, Revolver and Sgt Pepper on day one, and start your headlong dive right in.\n\nBy the way, if you are just getting on your way to full fledged Beatledom, here is a fact for you: the shot on the back cover here is the Beatles at EMI in 1963 and was used for the cover of Please Please me in the UK. In 1969, the Beatles started to record an album called \"Get Back\" and were going to use the front shot here-same place-as the cover. But the band was falling apart and Get Back became Let It Be, so the cover was not used until this issue.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Back in the 80's, there were so many great songs, that some got lost in the shuffle, only for those 80's kids to bring them back in their current work. This underrated song was all but lost to the radio time vaults till Napoleon Dynamite made it its credits song, perfectly going along with the movie. The result was the rediscovering of this classic, and amazingly, it still held up. Covers quickly ensued.\n\nMusically, the song has a lite poppy feel, that is distinctively 80's. Is it 70's? No. Is it 90's? Nope, it is unmistakably 80's. It's a nice feel to the song, and it really adds an extra flavor to it. Vocally, while the verses lag, and fail to deliver a great punch, making for the only complaint of the song, the main chorus is perfect. Well, almost, that \"I promise you,\" does drag it down.\n\nHowever, the lyrics are really the crown jewel and highlight of the song. They're as great now as they were then, if not more so. They're well written, emotional in unexpected ways, and it really speaks about the aspect of love that's rarely touched upon: Us guys who can't think of the perfect words to say to our perfect and lovely ladies. The lyrics really hit home for us poor guys, and really make it an even better song than it already was.\n\nOverall, one of the most underrated and forgotten about songs from the 80's that was lost for so many years, but is finally making a comeback. Why iTunes doesn't have it is beyond me, and is really a musical travesty. So many fans are getting jibbed of great music.\n\nIn other arenas, the song went perfect with Napoleon Dynamite, and the song seemed better because of it. It's like they completed each other to make one another more emotional in their own little way.\n\nAnd because of the movie, covers ensued. Anberlin's cover of the song wasn't that great. It was a straight up cover, with some acoustic elements added to it, that really didn't add to the song. Plus, they are so alike on vocals, you still had the same problem. New Found Glory also covered the song, but they made it more upbeat than the original, giving it more of a pop\/rock influence, but it still kept the emotion of the original song, and added another layer to it.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Usually, a Tracy Chapman song is urbane, in a quiet understated hip way, with a slice of wit. \"Talkin' Bout A Revolution\" is not that. Although it has become popular as an anthem in her concerts and covered by several artists, it is thin from start to finish.\n\nTrying to address real problems (poverty apparently, but not clearly, due to oppression), Chapman's lyrics have nothing original about them. She released this as the second single of her career. Considered political aware, it offers nothing but a complaint about the obvious.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"Wasting time in the unemployment lines\nSitting around waiting for a promotion.\"\n\nShe whispers \"It sounds like a whisper.\"\n\nAnd she fills in space by repeating \"Run Run Run Run...\"\n\nThe music is sharply produced, but is stuck in a generic 1980s folk rock beat.\n\nTracy Chapman tried too hard on this one and delivered a weak song. She has a better catalog than this.\n\nAnthony Trendl\nanthonytrendl.com","classification":3,"fold":8}

Granted he wrote and recorded the original track back in the Thriller era (Paul Anka is the co-writer which seems odd on the surface but they had being a teen idol in common), but the new production gives a modern touch without losing its breezy fun.  While Justin Timberlake is a credible successor to Mr. Jackson's pop crown, his addition to the track seems more for having his name attached for airplay as opposed to any artistic grounds.  He is almost unnoticeable throughout and the song is neither hurt or helped by his presence.  The song was Mr. Jackson's first to crack the top ten since 2001 peaking out at number 9.  Let's hope any future releases of Mr. Jackson's outtakes are given this kind of effort and work as it will make it seem like fresh music from a lost star and not just a money grab.","classification":5,"fold":8}

The song could be compared to REM's classic, \"The One I Love,\" in that, the title sounds, well, like a lovesong, but actually it's like a break-up song. Bareilles does a great job at creating a radio-friendly upbeat pop song. And it all seems to work. Just the other day, I heard the song twice within a span of 15 minutes, on completely different radio stations.\n\nOverall, a great little pop tune from a big talent.

{"text":"The Mystic Knights of The Oingo Boingo have come a long was since presiding in the Devil's Chamber in that truly cult classic, THE FORBIDDEN ZONE, directed by Richard Elfman {sibling elf}, a highly entertaining venture into the vortex of utter madness. Since their innovative neo-punk beginnings, Danny Elfman has led the Knights onto many musical victories, including his own solo projects, & finally, movie scores. Such titles as BATMAN RETURNS, BEETLEJUICE, THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE XMAS, NIGHTBREED & EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, are among his celebrated compositions.\nThe name has been put through the guillotine, severed in half to display a highly crystallized evolution. A focus on heavier rhythm guitars have been added, giving the album a sharper edge. The cover displays an interesting little clown, deformed in his composit. The back shows some aesthetic terrorism as well.\nNow, this erubescent, modern-day Wolfgang brings forth a series of songs which speak from his satanic heart, of anti-assimilation in the jesting guise of conformity. Particularly noticable in the cantible \"Insatanity\". where the voices of little ones valiantly defy xian indoctrination by recognizing its unnaturalness. Also exposed is the hypocrisy of evangelists in their two-faced, money-grubbing, sexually-twisted forms.\nAnother favorite is \"Mary\", which is the common story of a blossoming midwestern girl breaking the apron strings to see the great-wide-world. The rub here, is that she enjoys what she feels, & for the first time, comes unto her own realizations & conclusionsnow thyat her overbearing xian family is out of the picture. It is quite an emotionally-evoking piece, especially when the syubbornness of her unfortunately xoid kin is displayed., in their unacceptance of her, when she finally finds something she really enjoys. Indulging in the pleasures of the flesh, & living a decadently hedonistic lifestyle which brings her satisfaction, & a sense of accomplishment. She was a bigger fish than they - she had ambition. I don't think it was too much of a blasphemous coincidence that the name hosen was \"Mary\", as in \"virgin\". By the way, the violins are sublime.\nThere's also a remake of the Beatles' \"I Am The Walrus\", a fun song that has been played at many a frat party, no doubt. SPIDER is an enjoyable diddy about he who glares from the wall. WAR AGAIN is an inspirational tune about war & the adrenalyn & tragedy of battle. It inspires pride. It is powerful in its emotional evocation, as the words are definitely felt, greatly compliments the music.\nOverall, this release is an experience, which is rare in the pop-\"music\" industry, with their trivial, monotonous, monosyllabic, non-music blare. Like Elman's other works, all which make an impression upon the listener, this is sure to please the discriminating, amalgamate, audial conniseur.","classification":5,"fold":8}

The guitars serve up hearty power chords, the rhythm section (Rick Markmann on bass and Ben Smith on drums) is rock solid, and Ann Wilson's voice can still rattle the farthest corner of an arena. What sets Heart apart from many other hard rock acts, and what's always set them apart, is their mix of stadium-sized bombast and something more nuanced. Even with the band playing flat out and Ann Wilson singing at the top of her voice, there's an emotional hook that reaches beyond sheer volume and power. The band's able to bring the energy to more lightly-built songs like \"Skin and Bones,\" using tone rather than decibels to make their point.

{"text":"I had been content with the three cd offering of \"GRRR\" since it was released at the end of 2012, but this past year I was finally able to pony up the dough for the five cd deluxe edition this Christmas. As a massive Rolling Stones fan, I felt it was a must-have, even if such a compilation would seem tedious to someone who owns almost all of these songs several times over. That said, I'm also a collector, and I couldn't pass up the remastered sound, either.\n\nSimply put, this five cd set does not disappoint. Every seminal Rolling Stones hit is here, from \"Satisfaction\" to \"Brown Sugar\" to \"Start Me Up\" and everything in between, as well as a healthy sampling of obscure album tracks spanning the entire length of their 50+ year career. The songs do indeed sound better than ever, especially the older stuff, which now blasts out of the speaker with force and clarity that make them sound like they were recorded yesterday. There's been some complaining about the abundance of single edits as opposed to album cuts, but I've come to expect those on most compilations, so it's not as much of a sticking point for me. A couple of the obscure choices don't necessarily strike me as essential (\"Flight 505\"?), but I appreciate the thought went into choosing them.\n\nThe bonus disc and the vinyl recording are both interesting keepsakes, and the accompanying booklet is absolutely thrilling. If you're as fanatical a Stones fans I am, this deluxe edition of \"GRRR\" is absolutely essential.","classification":5,"fold":8}

But they've still got the pop\/rock sound fans know and love as well as lyrics that will encourage and challenge.\n\nThe disc starts off with \"Shadows.\"  And if you let those first few seconds of calm lull you in, you'll be surprised when things pick up for this upbeat rocker that really gets rocking when the chorus starts.  The melody has takes a surprising turn or two.  The song itself is about the life we live chasing the shadows that is the world around us when we should be focusing on the light that is God.  For me, the money lines are the second verse.  \"My heart is an ocean raging\/And Your grace is all that keeps me from drowning\/My mind creates deceptions\/So I cling to reassure sinking.\"  Yep, that's me.\n\nThey follow that up with the title track, which looks at our struggle to live as people free from the power of sin.  There are images of holding on to the chains Jesus already broke and not trusting God, but it was the chorus that grabbed me right away.  \"Hallelujah\/We are free to struggle\/We're not struggling to be free.\"\n\n\"Worn\" is a song born from desperation.  I don't know the actual story behind it, but the verses speak of failing hope and just struggling to live day to day.  The chorus begs God for a glimpse of the hope he promises.  It doesn't offer anything beyond that, but it's much more moving because of it.  This is a ballad that really shows off the piano and is a beautiful number.\n\nAnd for a complete change of pace there's \"Losing,\" a song about the struggle to forgive those who have hurt us.  The lyrics may be a bit simple here, but the call for God to help me forgive is one I need to make all too often.  The music itself is what is most interesting here.  It starts out fairly poppish, but on the bridge it heads toward a rap\/hip hop mix before rounding out with a choir joining them on the final chorus for a Gospel feel.  It's a mix that, well, aside from the bridge actually works for me.  It's certainly not going to be toward everyone's tastes, but give it a chance.\n\nThen comes the first real miss - \"Don't Stop the Madness.\"  I get what they are trying to say here - God uses the trials to grow us.  But the chorus actively calling for them really doesn't sit well with me.  While the Bible reminds us to \"Count it all joy\" when we face trials, I don't know that we should actually be asking God for them.  It's a very catchy melody, so guess which chorus is always stuck in my head after listening to this disc.\n\nThe next few tracks cover topics such as the joy of Heaven contrasted with the sorrow of Earth and God's grace for all.  They've got the now familiar mix of pop and rock that is mostly prevalent on the disc, although they do go from mid-tempo to ballad and back.  These are good songs, but they don't stand out to me in the way the early part of the disc does.  Okay, I still don't quite get \"Hostage of Peace.\"  I just don't think the analogy they are going for quite works like they want it to, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nBut the last two songs are really good.  And this is going to be surprising since I usually complain about songs with repeated lyrics in the chorus.  Both are very focused on worship.  Up first is \"You Do All Things Well,\" a song of surrender reminding us that God works beauty out of ugly things.  It's a quieter song that truly lifts the spirit.\n\nAnd disc closes out with another quiet song, \"Lamb of God.\"  Piano and strings take the lead here on this minor key song.  The chorus just soars with \"You are holy\/You are worthy\/You are holy\/You're the Lamb of God.\"  Nothing amazing with the lyrics, but heartfelt worship that is just beautiful to hear.  It gets even more gorgeous as the choir comes back at the end.  As it fades out, it leaves you to contemplate our great God.\n\nWhile a few songs stand out, Tenth Avenue North could still use a little more variety to their mix.  But the lyrics are well worth sitting down and reading as you listen through the songs because there is some stuff there that will make you think.\n\nSo The Struggle will not be a struggle for the band's fans to enjoy.  And anyone who wants lyrics to challenge and encourage will find much to enjoy here as well.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Queensryche has evolved considerably over the past 20 years of their prolific careers. They've gone from fiery heavy metal in the days of their EP to the lush rock-opera of Operation: Mindcrime, to the sublime perfection of the commercially successful Empire, to their current status as a generic rock band. In the middle of these last two phases comes Promised Land. Compared to the remarkable accessibility of Empire, Promised Land is a little more difficult to appreciate. Living up to the amazing success and quality of Empire is nearly impossible, and I do not envy Promised Land for what it tried to do.\nThe problem lies in the fact that Promised Land's excellent songs are not as densely packed as those on Empire. Most of the songs are good, but not all the songs are excellent. There are moments of mediocrity that drag the album down from levels of excellence. The superlative production alleviates some of the boredom associated with the passable tracks, as do the thick wall-of-sound arrangements. However, interspersed amonst the middling pieces are some of the best tracks they've ever recorded, including some of the finest lyrics. The acoustic balladry of \"Bridge\" made for a lucrative single that deserved all its enjoined success. The sad, thoughtful \"Out of Mind,\" the ominous \"Lady Jane,\" and the hard rock trappings of \"Disconnected\" are all great. The true standouts are the stormy title track, with those monstrous arrangements and the harrowing tone, and the moving closer, \"Someone Else?\" The latter is the most un-Ryche song they've ever done, consisting only of piano and Geoff Tate's emotive vocals. The memorable piano riffs, thoughtful lyrics and Tate's passion are what makes this one special. Tate even strains on a note...guess he's human after all! Without the songcraft to elevate it to greatness, the production helps.\nA good Queensryche, almost a great one. Still, it can't touch the monolithic status of Mindcrime and Empire. In terms of songcraft, those albums are the band's best.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Wow! That was my first impression after taking a listen to this album that was released in April 2016. This one is a bit older but is just catching on after Sturgill was nominated for two Grammy Awards (including Album of the Year). He won one Grammy for Best Country Album. I discovered the album just this week and this album is HOT! HOT! HOT! and in my mind should have won Album of the Year but of course Adele \"25\" won, which itself is an excellent album - but \"A Sailor's Guide To Earth\" is far more diverse, versatile and overall a much stronger album than \"25.\"\n\nSturgill Simpson shows bits of David Gray, Alex Clare, Van Morrison and Ronnie Milsap. He is an old soul at the young age of 38. He writes songs with the wisdom of a sailor who has sailed the seas of life for twice the amount of decades of his actual age.\n\n\"A Sailor's Guide To Earth\" is categorized as a country music album and has climbed to #1 on both the country music and rock music charts as well as #1 on the folk music charts. It has also reached #3 on billboard's Top 200 albums chart. This week the album re-entered the Billboard chart at #44 with a bullet.\n\nThough categorized as a country music album it is far more versatile than simply a country album. The depth in musicianship and lyrics puts the album in a category all it's own. This is quite simply one of the most intriguing albums of the past 20 years.\n\nThis album is full of introspection, joy and great guitar and synthesizer sounds... and Sturgill wrote all the songs to boot (except the cover of Nirvana's \"In Bloom\").\n\nThe album opens with the sounds of ship's bell chiming (a sound you hear on other songs throughout the album) and the beautiful tinkling of keyboards. \"Welcome To Earth\" sounds like a refreshing ocean morning relaxing in the mist of the ocean air. Three minutes in the song turns into a surprising upbeat Motown flavored experience with horns and R&B rhythms. As a matter of fact The Dap-Kings (famous for playing behind Sharon Jones) are the credited horn section on this song and several others on the album.\n\nThe otherworldly \"Breakers Roar\" is soothingly beautiful accented with country tinged steel guitars bringing out an ethereal sound that gives the song a floating feel. This song screams David Gray but so much more in it's intensity and beauty.\n\n\"Keep It Between The Lines\" is a traditional country song that breaks out with a high-stepping brass section very reminiscent of 1979 era Ronnie Milsap. This immediately made me think of Milksop's '79 hit \"Get It Up.\" The song features some hot licking slide guitar and awesome electric guitar. The rhythm section fires up the funk keeping it all in a traditional country music style.\n\n\"In Bloom\" is the only song not written by Sturgill Simpson. \"In Bloom\" was written by Kurt Cobain and was featured on the 1992 Nirvana album \"Nevermind.\" Sturgill took the song and made it all his own with an intense delicate power working into a storm of emotion and a wall of sound production.\n\nBrace For Impact (Live A Little)\" is my favorite song from the album for many reasons. I love the David Gilmour style guitar chords and the music video is eerie and amazing. Simpson sings this anthemic song with conviction and intensity like no other singer of this decade. \"Brace For Impact\" is not what you would expect to hear on a country music album. With it's pulsating electric bass opening it is a song that sounds like it could have been written for a Pink Floyd album all the while maintaining it's country music influence. \"Brace For Impact\" is a song about death and how different people react to it's inevitability. Sturgill's dark guitars and electronic synthesizer drive this song and turn it into an event in music that should not be missed.\n\n\"All Around You\" is a great 1950s blues style country song while \"Oh Sarah\" is that country song filled with hurt, pain and joy.\n\nThe album closes with one of it's strongest songs. \"Call To Arms\" starts of with the distant sound of seagulls, ship bells and bag pipes. The bag pipes add this unusual sort of ocean sound to the song - it works quite well. Quickly the song turns funky with R&B honky tonk horns that makes the song feel like something you might have heard in the explosive 1980 film \"The Blues Brothers.\" Let me tell you the guitar work in this song is absolutely killer. I am a huge fan of the guitar and Sturgill ranks right up there with the best of the best. The bluesy piano parts rock this song out which at points reminds me just a little bit of Elvis Presley.\n\n\"A Sailor's Guide To Earth\" is one of those albums that has surprises around each corner. The musical texture is as diverse as it gets and best of all Sturgill Simpson is a really great singer. I highly recommend this album to anyone that is an avid fan of diversity in music.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"...but it's still excellent throughout, though just SLIGHTLY overrated. How could a four-star disc be overrated, you ask? Well, I don't hear the voice of God in every track. I do in most, but a couple in the end kinda bored me - On a Plain sounded much better Unplugged, and there's just no saving tripe like Territorial Pissings, Lounge Act or Stay Away.\n\nNow, let's get to the GOOD stuff! Yeah, there's plenty of that. For starters is the deserved smash Smells Like Teen Spirit - heavy yet melodic, hard-rocking yet vunerable, with one of the best guitar riffs of the '90's, yadda yadda yadda. All the praise you've heard about it is true. Even better is Lithium, disturbing yet unforgettable lyrics and a stick-in-your-mind, Dazed and Confused-esque descending bassline. And lotsa melody. Which is one reason I love Nirvana - Cobain's melodies were exquisite. Come As You Are is higlighted by a downright unforgettable ringing riff, In Bloom by a strong drum track and snarled refrain. Polly deals with rape in a disturbingly stark way, drawing you in while scaring you off. Breed and Drain You are some pretty raw, rockin' stuff, the kind of song the group did best. These were the hits, but how could anybody let the droning, mesmeric closer Something in the Way slip under the radar? Totally underrated song, I think. And then there's that insane hidden track, Endless Nameless or whatever... whoa. Pure craziness.\n\nNot the best record of the '90's (Dirt), or even the best Nirvana album (In Utero). But it's the place to start, not only with the group but with alt-rock in general.\n\nI say screw all the angsty alt-rockers that were influenced by this album's lyrics. Kurt really was an alienated guy (he didn't WANT to be famous, for the love of Buddha!), and was communicating genuine emotions. As opposed to all these other morons, who whine about being \"misunderstood\" simply to make money.\n\nTo close this rather wordy review, Nirvana (and Pearl Jam, and the rest of them) came just in time, justly knocking those stupid hair-metal bands off the charts and replacing them with a new golden age for rock rivaling the creatively fertile 1965-1975 period. It's a shame that, after this, crap groups like Green Day (who were essentially riding Nirvana's coattails), Oasis, MCR and Slipknot became popular...","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Throughout the 70's a group known as Earth Wind & Fire brought happiness to the radio waves and the dance floors.  This group had some outa-sight funky songs that made you tap your foot and roller skate to the rhythm.  Their songs, reflecting the innocence of the era, were colorful and upbeat.  The direction and genius of Maurice White was responsible for making this funk possible.  Vocally, they were a soulful chorus with Phillip Bailey's falsetto leading throughout most of these songs.\n\nThe opening number \"Shining Star\" is more than a far-out funky tune.  Just listen to that vocal blend and that rousing arrangement.  \"That's The Way of the World\", \"September\", \"Sing a Song\", \"Mighty Mighty\", \"Saturday Night\", and \"Get Away\"  are trade mark songs of the group.  Nobody can remake these or has even tried.  Yet, the group has successfully recorded other's songs like \"Can't Hide Love\" and \"Got To Get You Into My Life\".  The highlights that deserve giving more than a quick listen are \"Fantasy\" which is a gorgeous blend of voices,  \"Kalimba Story\" which a totally original song written by Maurice White, \"Reasons\" which is a gorgeous love song with Phillip Bailey in the lead vocal, and last, but not least, \"After The Love Has Gone\" which is a very fine ballad.\n\nOne cannot leave out the musical arrangements that accompany the vocal group of Earth Wind & Fire.  While it is extremely rare today to find comparable talent on a recording, it was also quite rare in the 70's era to find such artistry on studio recordings.  But this is what added to the group's sound and what made them so popular.  There were rich sounds from not only keyboards, guitars, drums, and saxophones, but instruments that brought the full experience:  trumpets, trombones, congas, flutes, violins, violas, tubas, harps, and timpani.\n\nThis collection of songs is fun for those who remember the funk era and fun for those who just want to experience enjoyable, upbeat music.

{"text":"I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play \"Amarillo By Morning,\" and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to \"Amarillo by Morning.\"\n\nSo, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy\/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Raekwon announced F.I.L.A. a couple of years ago but due do internal issues with Wu-Tang, finishing their latest album & other circumstances it wasn't released until late April of 2015. A lot of hype was behind this album & a lot of peeps were expecting a near classic but unfortunately it just missed the mark. Lyrically, he is as sharp & on point as usual but the guest appearances & some of the beats weren't tailored for the Chef & as a result it doesn't flow as well as it could have. I give him props for trying a different approach (going for more of a mainstream sound) but that's not who he is. Granted he is one of the more popular MC's in the Wu but that doesn't make him commercial material (not a bad thing by any means). I would give this album 3.5 stars because when it does work, it sounds great (check out the tracks with his partner in crime Ghostface Killah) but I can't. I hate to say it but maybe he should have had RZA produce all of the tracks (even though his track record hasn't been great lately) but hopefully next time things will align better for Rae.","classification":4,"fold":8}

B ut if you enjoy a ballad-laden and breezy listen of half-female voices -with a sprinkling of male duets and solo shots and bands- this is a welcome free ride. Songrtress Barnaby Bright was the artist that I enjoyed the most. She\/they mined similar vocal, instrumnetal and lyrcial landscape as someone else I really admire; Canada's Kathleen Edwards (\"Failer\" era).

But every now and then, they can bring the influence into the mainstream fairly well. That shows with their latest hit Walking, from their album Something Big. The song isn't really bad at all. It slowly crept up on me, and really has a nice rhythm to it. However, my one and only gripe about the song from the two of them is that it honestly is very short. I wish they could've made it a little bit longer to appeal for those new to their sound. Still, this is a good download for anyone whom is both new to Mary Mary, or been a hard core fan of the duo.

That is giving us messages from the heart that inspire us to press on and not to grow weary of doing good. Put God first and then everything else will fall into line. The TBT choir does not \"perform\" but rather, it ministers to those who need to be encouraged during these days of trials and tribulations. On this album you will find sweet ballads and soul stirring anthems to lift your spirit. I never lost my praise is the track that comes to mind. It speaks of giving God the praise even in the dark times because He always comes through for you. It encourages you to not let the world steal your joy and rob you of the praises that you should offer up daily.

For newcomer, Lorde, she has absolutely had a lot to prove trying to have a great song, without feeling whitewashed away by the overflooding of artists like Beyonce' and Rihanna, but has also had to separate herself from the shadows of Adele as well. Royals, is definitely one catchy song. The lead single from her Pure Heroine record is a very catchy song. It definitely is up there with great songs from Adele's Rolling In The Deep and Coldplay's Paradise as one of Britain's catchiest tunes of the past several years.

{"text":"I remember, during my Beatles-obsessed teenage years, how \"Rubber Soul\" was almost automatically referred to as \"The Beatles' move into folk-rock.\"  Perhaps this is because, until 1987, many Americans knew the \"Help!\" album as half Beatles music, half movie instrumentals.  I personally consider \"Help!\" to be an album chock full of excellent folk-rock from the Fab Four; in fact, some of the finest folk-rock ever recorded.  Let us consider a few choice examples:\n\n\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away.\"  Yes, there is an obvious Dylan influence\/imitation at work here.  But, hey, if you're going to imitate, might as well imitate one of the best.  And, it is a great song.  A few years after its original release, none other than Waylon Jennings saw fit to cover it.  In my book, that's enough proof.\n\n\"You're Going to Lose that Girl.\" Mid-tempo folk-rock.  Uplifting.  Transcendent.  Perfect.\n\n\"Ticket to Ride.\"  McGuinnesque guitar, and some mighty fine drumming from Ringo.\n\n\"Act Naturally.\"  The Beatles take on a Buck Owens hit with lead vocals courtesy of Ringo.  It is well-documented that Ringo has a genuine love of country music, and it shows on this track.\n\n\"It's Only Love.\"  The music on this track has a Western movie feel to it; that's why I like it.\n\n\"I've Just Seen a Face.\"  Another great song with a country feel to it.  Arlo Guthrie did a fine cover, and this song has also become something of a bluegrass staple.\n\nThese are not necessarily the best songs on the album (except \"You're Going to Lose that Girl,\" which is an all-time great tune and the best song on the album); they're the ones I make my \"folk-rock argument\" with.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention George Harrison's contributions, \"I Need You,\" and \"You Like Me Too Much.\"  These are both credible additions to his songwriting bank.  And, Paul's \"The Night Before\" is an excellent piece of songcraft buoyed by the backing vocals of Lennon and Harrison.  Honestly, there's not a bad track on here.  If you're thinking about investigating the new remasters, \"Help!\" would be a great place to start.","classification":5,"fold":8}

I accidently got stuck with this song when I was attempting to download the amazon mp3 feature for another musical track.  \"Honest Face\" is more for those who can look past the screeching sounds and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizers and maneaters.","classification":1,"fold":8}

{"text":"If we are to judge a book (or, in this case, an album) by its cover, then Mastodon's sixth album, \"Once More 'Round The Sun\" is one hell of a wild ride. As the Atlanta foursome have climbed to the top of the metal heap for the past decade, they've gone from sludgy metallers to prog-rock prodigies and hard-rock mainstays and everything in between in a relatively short amount of time. It's no surprise then that the follow-up to 2011's rather stripped-down \"The Hunter\" finds the band once again shifting gears. Getting back into the groove after taking a slight detour, \"One More 'Round The Sun\" finds Mastodon at home, once delivering their own brand of zany and infectious heavy metal to the masses. Splitting the difference between proggy goodness and radio-gold, the band have finally found the key to pleasing its loyal fanbase as well as appealing to a completely new audience.\n\nThe album opens with appropriate vigor, via the Walter White anthem, \"Tread Lightly.\" Classic Mastodon, it's undoubtedly heavy, fast-paced, catchy and chock full of intricacies. From there, the album snowballs with the emotionally-charged, full-throttle \"The Motherload\" which has perhaps the catchiest chorus in Mastodon history, coupled with a brilliantly chunky bridge in which each individual member of the band is allowed time to shine. While there's nothing on this album quite as beautifully sorrowful as \"The Sparrow\" (the closing track from \"The Hunter\"), it's safe to say that \"Once More 'Round The Sun\" is the most down-to-Earth Mastodon effort to date. It's very clear that the guys are on a mission and took the recording of this album personal. It's appropriate then that they recruited producer Nick Raskulinecz, who has seemingly made a career for himself by churning out brilliant comeback albums for the likes of Alice in Chains, Deftones and Rush. Like those albums, \"Once More\" gets the band back on track, delivering everything that made them good in the first place while introducing a much-needed breath of fresh air. Nowhere is this more clear than on the playful \"Aunt Lisa,\" which finds the band channeling The Ramones via Faith No More (think \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" meets \"Be Aggressive\"). It's precisely this sort of awesome wackiness we've come to love about Mastodon and the rest of the album will have you humming along, bobbing your head and often back-tracking to make sure you heard what you think you just heard.\n\nAt the end of the day, commercial rock and metal is rarely so satisfying as it is under Mastodon's watch and while it may not please the straight-faced fans who would prefer the band go through the motions and put out another \"Remission\" or \"Leviathan,\" it will please just about anyone who loves their metal big, bold and full of flavor. \"Once More 'Round The Sun\" is the sort of trip you're likely to take again and again, and it only gets better each time around. Give it a spin and you'll see.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Ever since the end of 2013 with Beyonce's self titled album making a surprising debut on iTunes? Artists as diverse as D'Angelo have continued to explore the territory of releasing a surprise album for an excited public. Is it a futurist social commentary for the music industry? Is it a gimmick? Or,as in this case is it a response to an online album leak? Well it can be none,or all. But it shakes things up. And that's what Bjork has built her entire musical career on since her days with the Sugarcubes. This album was released online here and through iTunes yesterday. I decided to download it myself. Bjork's music has excited me since I first heard it about 18 years ago. And it's always wonderful to see what she comes up with each time she offers the people of the world her musical art.\n\n  \"Stonemilker\" combines a spacious melody accented with an orchestra of violins an viola's with pulsing electronic percussion layering as the main rhythm. \"Lionsong\" begins with a vocal symphony of a multi tracked Bjork harmonizing with herself before a trickling,pulsing keyboard and the string orchestration leads the rest of the way. \"History Of Touches\" is built around waves of electronic orchestration-some of a purely instrumental and others of a rather more vocal nature. \"Black Lake\" is another pretty string laden melody while \"Family\" has a darker.discordant cello sounding approach that's purposefully off tune as Bjork harmonizes with another vocal side of herself-very much in doubt. \"Notget\" is one of my favorites here-a rather Japanese melody where Bjork (as is common) sings very much outside the melody.\n\n  \"Atom Dance\" showcases a slow plucking violin based march that builds into an outright parade march with singer Antony singing in what sounds like Icelandic played back in reverse.  \"Mouth Mantra\" is a song where the vocals and the beats all build to a chaotic mass of rhythm before the nervous drum 'n' bass of \"Quicksand\" ends the album. Conceptually this album deals with Bjork's in depth analyzation of a troubling romantic breakup. Her poetic observations about finding the \"mutual coordinates\" of her partner,even down to how to deal with their parents provides an emotionally naked experience that's illustrated in literary terms that fall somewhere between European opera,Japanese theater and Icelandic folk story narratives. Bjork's albums always tend to sound like soundtracks to a performance art piece or an avant garde opera. And this album begs for a visually compelling theatrical presentation. It's music you can visualize as well as listen to. And definitely a worthwhile digital media surprise from this always unique musical artist.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"This album was a great shock, understandably, to many people when it came out - almost as much as Self-Portrait was. For that reason, and for Dylan's subsequent backing off from his Born Again phase - which has since received a certain \"cornpone\" status in his mythology - this album is often overlooked by many people. Let me be honest: if it wasn't Bob Dylan who made this album, I probably never would've listened to it, much less bought it. I am not a religous person, and Gospel and Gospel-inflected music are not among my favorites. I held off on buying this and made it one of my last Dylan purchases. However, let me be the first to tell you that I was pleasantly surprised! Odd as it may seem, this album is actually a return for Dylan in many ways. Ever since Blood On The Tracks, Dylan had been dipping his toe into more and more complex musical visions - the international vibe of the Desire album, the Rolling Thunder Revue, the big band-addled Street Legal, and his subequent \"Vegas\" tour - and this album goes back to the stripped-down rock band arrangements that he had long been known for. Whether or not you like it as much as his previous two albums - I don't, personally - it's easy to see that it's more focused, more concise, and that Bob was way more into it. Here we see him, perhaps for the first time ever, trying his hardest to make his music as smooth, polished, and presentable as possible. Clearly, Dylan was trying to reach as many as people as possible with this album, something he had never cared about before. The production by Barry Beckett and Jerry Wexler on this album is immaculate, and still sounds great today. It sounds better than anything he has recorded and released since (with the exception of the re-mastered songs on Biograph.) It's a sad fact that Columbia has neglected the Bob Dylan catalog - without argument, their most important artist - with only one of his albums, Street Legal, being remastered; and this is one of his few albums that still sounds great today. Furthermore, Dylan took even greater steps: hiring the then-in vogue (and terrific) group Dire Straits to be his backing band, and going down to Alabama to record the album with the Muscle Shoals Horns and a full gospel choir. Although the music on this album is not his best, and certainly not his most original, it is a very tight, focused effort. Mark Knopfler has gotten props several times for his playing on this album, and it's easy to see why. The rest of the players, as well as the production, are top-notch as well. The album is not necessarily what you might expect lyrically, either. Certainly, it's steeped highly in Christian imagery and Biblical allusion, particularly that of the book of Revelation. But, Dylan had been weaving Biblical allusions into his lyrics for his entire caree - from early tracks like When The Ship Comes In to practically the entire album John Wesley Harding, to the deeply spiritual-leaning Street Legal. Of course, he had never approached it the way he does on here. They are not merely enrichening the songs, they ARE the songs. The lyrics can be a bit dogmatic at times - and, of course, self-righteous - but you can enjoy, and like, them regardless of your own personal set of beliefs. Even if you don't agree with the opinions expressed within, you can still appreciate them as art. They do often have a very arrogant ring to them - Bob is practically breathing fire and brimstone on some of the tracks! No less a figure than Nick Cave has gone on record as saying that this is his all-time favorite album, citing its \"anger and nastiness... certainly not like the thing you find on most Christian albums.\" We get bitter, impassioned performances from Dylan on such songs as Gotta Serve Somebody and Slow Train. He hadn't been this focused and into his material since... well, quite a long time. You can tell he's really into it, and truly pouring his heart out into his vocals and his performances. Standout tracks include the Gotta Serve Somebody, a \"list\" song with some truly biting vocals from Dylan (it's just unbelievably cool to hear him stretch out that word \"somebody\"), for which he won a greatly deserved vocal performance Grammy. Precious Angel is nothing less than a love song - a moving ode to the woman who turned him on to Christianity. Slow Train is an absolutely ferocious song that attacks corrupt politics - one of the album's sub-themes - while weaving in much distressing imagery from Revelation. I Believe In You is an absolutely beautiful song about unwavering faith (Dylan as JOB.) To be sure, not all the songs are of this quality, and some even border on embarrassing, now. Still, this is quite a good album, and an essential one for any Dylan fan. Whatever one might say about Dylan's conversion, one thing is certain: it re-invigorated him artistically, and got him interested in his work again and he turned out his most focused and concise album since Blood On The Tracks.","classification":4,"fold":8}

But, there is always something waiting in the wings that can be good. That was the case with underground artists Fun, and their collaboration with Janelle Monae with We Are Young from their debut album Some Nights. The song isn't bad, and definitely puts them on track to be this coming generations' Weezer. Yet, I did honestly wish that there could've been more from Janelle in the song. She had a lot in her voice a few years ago with Tightrope, and I thought there was more in the heart that could've been from her. Still, hopefully Fun will keep it up, and flow into that next generation of talent.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"I avoided this album upon its initial release because of the mostly mixed to negative reaction from critics compared to the almost unanimous critical praise of their first four albums.  That was a huge mistake and clear example of bad judgement on my part!  I'm actually a newer fan of Pixies and Frank Black, especially since I was born around the time they first broke up.  I discovered them through many outlets from their inclusion at the end of Fight Club to the comedic cover of 'Here Comes Your Man' on 500 Days of Summer.  I had read about the bands history and how important and groundbreaking their first two albums were.  I completely ignored their albums Bossanova and Trompe for no real good reason at first.  I never really listened to Surfa Rosa but just took the critics words for it.  In fact I never listened to any of their albums entirely until recently, remember my age so give me a pass.  For some reason I decided to check out the Pixies albums in 2015 finally.  But not before I checked out Frank Blacks solo albums.  I only listened to the first two.  Teenager of the Year is now one of my favorites of all time.  So I listened to each of the bands albums fully a few times each.  I didn't like Surfa Rosa as much as everyone else.  Sure its great, but I just never got into it.  Doolittle is of course amazing.  But then came Bossanova and Trompe, which I thought were their worst albums based on lower sales at first which was very stupid of me.  They ended up being my favorite albums of the band, Surfa being my least.  I can already see hipsters shaking their heads and arrogantly blindly disagreeing.\n\nI realized finally that I should not give a crap about critics reviews.  I paid too much attention to Pitchfork, who is the almighty hipster music haven.  They worshiped this band but hated this album which turned me off from it.  I'm glad to say I have finally denounced giving a crap about what those hooligans at Pitchfork have to say, good or bad, about any album.  It's mostly the hipsters who are blindly angry at this album just because Kim Deal isn't on it.  But, even though I'm a newer fan of the band, I'm pretty sure I know that Kim herself has said that she is just the bassist and Frank Black is the main man.  Its true.  I never really liked the few songs that Kim wrote for the band which included the overrated 'Gigantic'.  Her absence isn't even that big a deal.  If she had been with the band, she would just be doing bass not writing the songs.  Okay, now onto this album.  The album would only sound slightly different if she was still in the band, and I personally don't care whether she comes back or not, even if she is talented and hot.  This contained some of the most emotional and accessible songs from the band.  Like some have said, this has more in common with Bossanova and Frank Blacks early solo career and that's good.  It does sound more modern.  The songs do sound more radio friendly as a whole compared to the old albums having only a few radio songs per album.  So what if almost every song sounds like it could be a single?  This is why hiipsters are annoying.  They will make an album or band seem horrid if they sound catchy or commercial or dare I say \"Mainstream\".  I loved the bands hardcore songs like 'Debaser' and 'Tame' but I loved their more melodic and soothing songs like 'Velouria' and 'Letter to Memphis' much more.  This album is full of those 'Velouria' type songs and some harder songs like the opening track 'What Goes Boom' which is vintage harder Pixies.  I can understand why there is much less of the hardcore Pixies sound.  Its simple, Frank is old and I like that hes writing more friendly and soothing songs for the band.  The songs 'Greens and Blues' and 'Indie Cindy' are so beautiful.  'Greens and Blues' particularly has such infectious twirling surf guitars and a chorus that pulls the heartstrings.  I wish that was a hit for the band.  The single 'Bagboy' has a chorus that almost pays homage to Debasers chorus.  By the way the chorus features what sounds like Kim, but isn't.  Every track on here has something special and appealing.  Its not groundbreaking, but it doesn't have to be to be considered great.  Thats what many people nowadays get wrong.  The track 'Ring the Bell' is one of the obvious attempts at a more modern style, and I like it alot.  The guitars are very U2 and heartwarming.  'Another Toe In The Ocean' is another great song full of layered melodies.  'Snake' is what a James Bond Pixies song would sound like.  It's a fast song with some great edgy guitar work and Davids awesome drumming.  People make Kim up to seem like the biggest part of the band.  Sure her bass was nice in some songs, but I'm pretty sure I liked the guitar of Santiago better.  Franks vocals are better and he IS the mastermind of the band from the beginning.  Davids drumming skills are as good as ever too.  He also even had a good lead vocal track on 'La La Love You\" from Doolittle.  When I think of a new Pixies album, I don't worry about how often I'll hear Kims backing vocals, I was actually looking forward to David doing more vocals alongside Frank.  Using a female, or anyone that sounds like a female (BagBoy) as a backing vocal on some songs are pure proof that Kims contributions are very replaceable.  If you're not a closeminded hipster who disowns anything from this band without the entire original lineup, then you'll love this album I'm sure.  If you liked Bossanova, you'll love this album.  The melodies Frank and Santiago make on these new songs are just great and stand tall next to what many consider their best albums.  Like I said, even if Kim was still in the band her contribution would be small.  She was barely noticeable in Bossanova and Trompe, yet those were hailed by critics.  This is what the Pixies would sound like today, and it sounds nice.  It's only been a year since Indie Cindy hit stores officially and it's being dismissed a lot.  I say give it 5 to 10 more years and it'll have many critical re-evaluations.  I'm not saying it will be hailed in high regards like Doolittle and Surfa, but I'm sure it will be considered another worthy classic for the band.  Hopefully another hit cult movie uses one of these new songs for a soundtrack and brings in even more new fans.  I really wanna hear more of this new Pixies in the coming years.  If Kim does ever come back, then okay to that.  If she never comes back, then okay to that too, you already know I like this new yet familiar sound the band is producing.\n\nI'll consider this the Pixies most accessible album so far.  I like it.  Sorry I ranted on too much about all the dumbfounded naysayers and Kim.  Just know this album really isn't nearly as bad as many are saying.  Give it at least 3 listens before you really decide if you like it.  I know I love it.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"\"Help\" was the Beatles' second film and also the title of their fifth album released within two and a half years. It was an extremely busy time for the group with constant demand for new singles, concerts, interviews and more.\n\nThe music was recorded during the first half of 1965 and first half of the album's tracks were included in the film.\n\nBefore the album was released in August 1965 two of the strongest tracks from the album, \"Ticket to Ride\" and the title track \"Help\",  had already been released, and reached the ecpected and deserved number one positions on both sides of the Atlantic. Both numbers sung by Lennon, whose lead vocals were especially strong these years.\n\nMcCartney's \"Yesterday\" later also made it number one though not in the UK, where it was not released.\n\nThe many live performances the group played during this period, strengthened their voices, and McCartney also sings with force and conviction on another strong song \"The Night Before\" - he might even sound slightly worn.\n\nLike most Beatles albums, it contains no real weak tracks, although \"Act Naturally\", with Ringo in front, has a certain charm it is obviously not the most memorable track on the album.\n\nLennon's fascination with Bob Dylan, shows on the title track and the folky \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\".\n\nLennon has also lead vocals on the two fine \"You're Going to Lose That Girl\" and \"It's Only Love\", One the album the group releases their final cover of a rock and roll standard - \"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\" - again with Lennon in terrific form.\n\nHarrison contributes two songs, and especially \"I Need You\" is a great song that does not stand back to most Lennon-McCartneys compositions.\n\nAnother great Beatles album with beautiful melodies and vocal harmonies - along with great sounding guitars. Also an album that shows that the group musically was still in strong development.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I stumbled upon 10 years and 'The Autumn Effect' when they released it and enjoyed their take on the music industry.  For their follow-up, another good solid effort here from the band.  Although nothing earth shattering it's just a great release and will add to their fan base.  Not a bad song worth mentioning although there are a couple of slower songs on the cd, but don't let that get you bogged down from picking this up.  Even these songs have great moments.  Although there might not be the prog type 9 minute song as in their last cd, there's still plenty here for you to enjoy.  I'm not going to run it down song by song, but my favorite is 'Focus' so far, but that could change as I listen to it more.  The group has a unique sound, but that could get them in trouble with each cd they release sounding like the last.  I can see that here in this release sounding a little generic as though it could have been on the \"The Autumn Effect' release, but there are enough elements here to make it different than their last.  Time will tell as they progress and mature.  Overall, a solid four with not a bad track worth mentioning.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"A collection of twelve songs, five written or co-written by Raitt, and all possessing passion and power. Her voice shows no ill-effects of time, it is as agile as ever whether poignantly singing a ballad or belting one out. And, that voice along with the rich expressive sound that she coaxes from her electric slide guitar remains her unmistakable signature.\n\nBlues is at the heart of her work, and this albums is a mix of her own songs and interpretations of music from other genres fashioned to accommodate the mournful cry of her slide guitar and world-weary voice. The thread tying this albums selections together is not uncommon -- desire, love and grief.\n\nThe selections, although varied, use the same group of musicians, contributing to the cohesive sound. Backing vocals and instruments switch around a bit, but essentially the musicians include Jon Cleary  backing vocals and electric piano, George Marinelli electric and acoustic guitar, Mike Finnigan Hammond B3 and keyboards, James Hutch Hutchinson, Bass, and Ricky Fataar drums and percussion.\n\nAdditional keyboards by Patrick Warren, and backing vocals on a couple of songs provided by Arnold McCuller and Maia Sharp. The Hammond organ appears in most of the songs -- an unexpected element that seemed to add weight to the basic foundation.\n\nBallads, blues and rock the album includes a range of songs from a T Bone Burnett\/Cesar Rosas tune. Shakin Shakin Shakes, to the late 1980s INXS hit, Need You Tonight. A standout is one of her compositions, The Ones We Couldnt Be. It is a simple production -- pretty much just her at the piano.\n\nThe song addresses human shortcomings. When obstacles are in the path there can be a lack of urgency to remove them, often until it is too late. In a recent article Raitt mentioned a few years of reflection after her mother and then brother died. The song appears to be a product of that time period. Painfully personal and written unapologetically, touching on a universal truth for anyone that has experienced loss and regret.\n\nThis release does not disappoint -- it sounds great and for me has warranted repeated play. It contains songs of substance and exploration along with some just plain old good tunes. Raitt has earned her place with no small amount of dedication, skill, artistry and intelligence -- and this current release is undeniable evidence of that fact.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Following the release of 2001's \"Sinister Urge,\" Rob Zombie took a little hiatus away from music. During this five year absence, Rob made two feature films, so it was questionable if he would ever return to music, or just focus on his movie career full time. But now his fans can rejoice because Rob has finally returned with a new studio album.\n\n\"Educated Horses\" keeps the b-side\/horror movie samples to a minimum, so it may very well be the most focused and professional album of Rob's long and storied career. Plus, as songs like the churning \"American Witch,\" and the rhythmic \"17 Year Locust\" show, Rob still knows his way around a good hook. And there are a handful of standout tracks on here. \"The Scorpion Sleeps\" features a catchy stop-start beat with stutter-stepping guitars; songs like \"Let It All Bleed Out\" and \"Ride\" are backed by a powerful chug and churn guitar lead; and \"Death Of It All\" has a beautiful acoustic guitar intro\/outro and an unexpected, hooky hand-clap pattern.\n\nBut, unfortunately, \"Educated Horses\" has just as many drawbacks as good aspects. Firstly, there are no classics anywhere on here, and no songs that are anywhere near as good or memorable as, say, \"Dragula,\" \"Living Dead Girl,\" or \"Never Gonna Stop.\" It's doubtful that any of \"Educated Horses\" will stick with you or bounce around your head for very long.\n\nNext, this is doubtlessly Rob's most experimental and least heavy album. The single, \"Foxy Foxy,\" has a syncopated beat and digitized\/electronic vocals, whereas songs like the aforementioned \"17 Year Locust\" and \"The Devil's Rejects\" feature (what could be) a sitar. Experimentation isn't inherently a bad thing, but most would agree that heavy songs are catchier, more infectious, more exciting\/exhilarating, and hold the listener's attention better.\n\nFinally, the biggest flaw this C.D. has is that, like most RZ discs, \"Educated Horses\" is WAY too short. At a mere 11 tracks (with only nine of those being actual songs) and 39 minutes, it doesn't have time to be to wow the listener or be a satisfying step forward from \"Sinister Urge.\" It's curious that it took Rob this long to make a C.D. that's this brief.\n\nSo, there are a few good tunes here, but, as a whole, \"Educated Horses\" just kind of falls flat and isn't memorable. In fact, it's probably Rob Zombie's weakest album (that he's made by himself or with White Zombie). If you're not a diehard fan who needs a complete collection, you can definitely afford to skip this one or buy it used.","classification":3,"fold":8}

Howard's brand of R&B is mixed with influences of jazz, pop, folk, and singer-songwriter elements.  The result isn't always fully developed, but SHINE THROUGH IT allows for a couple of truly compelling moments. One strong point, regardless of weaker material, is the acoustic instrumentation.  There is nothing like a good album that uses live instrumentation.\n\nSHINE THROUGH IT's first couple of tracks are all \"fire\".  \"Love Makes You Beautiful\" is one of the most beautiful examples of orchestration in pop music I have heard for a while.  The string bass gives this track an inherent jazz feel while the acoustic piano, acoustic piano, and bells add the \"cherry on top\". Howard's vocals are great here, filled with great nuance and inflection that can't be denied.  Howard can actually sing; the issue for those expecting a more \"urban\" debut will be that Howard's songwriting isn't what was expected.\n\n\"Shine Through It\" shows Howard sounding very similar to a mix between Anthony Hamilton and John Legend.  As \"poppy\" as \"Shine Through It\" is, it is incredibly soulful.  The choir in the background is just great and shows Howard's cerebral nature in crafting this album. Once again, the strings are fantastic and add that extra dimension to SHINE THROUGH IT.  The brass truly makes this feel like we are reliving the 1960s\/70s again.  Say what you will about SHINE as a whole, but \"Shine Through It\" is fire.\n\n\"Mr. Johnson's Lawn\" shows more exceptional songwriting from Howard, if a bit less impressive than \"Love Makes You Beautiful\" or \"Shine Through It\". The tropical feel shows Howard once again stretching out his wings with a mesh of differing styles and influences. Vocally, Terrece isn't as refined as on the two previous standouts, but he still sounds fine.  \"Sanctuary\" lays very well, making it another fine listen.  \"No. 1 Fan\" isn't bad, if not truly great, while \"Spanish Love Affair\" 'is what it is'.  Lovely Spanish guitar work introduces the track followed by a Spanish instrumental groove. Now how often do pop albums have instrumental tracks these days? Not often.\n\n\"Plenty\" is an overall strong track, with an urban groove, still utilizing live drums and acoustic piano.  Howard does make the concession of adding an electric bass as opposed to string bass. Also, the addition or organ makes it clear to fans that Howard wanted to embrace \"soul\" on this track exclusively, laying down his folk ruminations momentarily.  \"I Remember When\" changes styles again, giving the sense of a 60's pop song. In fact, I believe that the Beach Boys or even the Beatles might perform something like this.  It works and it's catchy. It's nothing truly record-breaking, but it is a fine enough listen.\n\n\"It's All Game\" resurrects Howard's jazzy ruminations via a second instrumental track. It is a fine enough listen, though shows a bit of the problem with SHINE THROUGH IT - it is uneven.  \"She Was Mine\" has a 'tongue-n-cheek' jazz feel to it, which is enjoyable.  It's nothing that never been before, yet Howard resurrects it and brings the sound to a new group of listeners.  The closing track \"War\" features a big-band.\n\nThe main problem with SHINE THROUGH IT is it is over-ambitious and at some moments undercooked. Howard never sounds bad, but sometimes his songwriting is \"all over the place\".  It possesses potential in a number of ways, but I think that Howard's follow-up album would have to tune more closely into one style as opposed to being such a mixed bag as SHINE THROUGH IT. 3 stars.","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"This review is for the vinyl version of this mind blowing new album from Robert Plant and his incredible band! This is easily the best solo release he has ever made and by far! To hear this on the three sides of 180g vinyl is simply breath taking! Side four is a beautiful Zeppelin style etched design that truly is very cool. You really need to not be disturbed when you listen, stay focused, turn it up, and let the music suck you in and flow over an around your senses for one hell of a sonic ride! The lyrics tell the story as the music\/instrumentation takes the listener off to a very magical world of total nirvana! The album is to be listened to as a whole, not in parts...so I wonder why Rolling Stone only gave this masterpiece only three stars when Dylan or Springsteen could spit on the sidewalk, be recorded in 5.1 and given a five star review based on how cool it sounded when it landed. By the way, the cd, not the mp3 comes included with the vinyl purchase.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Twenty five years back I felt I was a member of a very special club as a tape trader of live shows of The Grateful Dead and many other bands and musicial artists. I'd receive a list from someone I didn't know and send them some shows from my list and some blank cassetes for them to tape music I had selected from the list they had sent to me and a relationship would then begin with another fan of music that was (to say the least) off-the-grind. About 75% of time it worked well and for about 25% of the time I got burned and never heard from the other party ever again. I think it was worth it to participate in this adventure and got past the 1\/4 rate of failure as anything worthwhile in life has it's risks....like a concert by The Grateful Dead does!\n\nThe spring 1977 tour of The Grateful Dead began on 22 April at The Spectrum in Philadelphia and ended in Hartford, Ct. on 28 May, four nights before the band attended a party at the Zigfield Theater in New York City on the first of June for the first screening of the \"Grateful Dead Movie.\" Many have written that this tour is a highlight of thirty years of a band on the road and over three thousand documented concerts and that statement is a judgement that must be made from your ears and your center if it indeed shall be recorded as fact.\n\nI am a big fan of 1977 live Grateful Dead music (along with 1972, 1985 and 1989-1990) and \"Dave's Picks\" seems to be aware that I'm not the only fan of concerts performed 35 years ago by this band of musicial misfits that did things so very different from everybody else as this new series begins with a spring 1977 show. On three CD's here we have three hours of live Grateful Dead music to behold.\n\nI have never heard this show before and it is good to my ears but not great as others from this same year I have enjoyed. It starts with a one-two punch of: \"Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodeloo\" and \"Jack Straw\" and they are both well played and both show early sparks of adventures to come. This CD of the first set contains average versions of \"Peggy-O\" \"Cassidy\" and \"Lazy Lightning>Supplication\" and ends with the first of three Chuck Berry tunes played on this night in Richmond: \"Promised Land.\"\n\nSet Two on discs two and three would be the reason for this show being selected into the ranks of official releases as a very strong \"Scarlet Begonias>Fire On The Mountain\" opens set two with 22 minutes of Dead joy. \"Estimated Prophet\" is shorter than many but really nice and \"He's Gone\" is one of the best you will find out of several hundred played as it's very soulful and extended but not overdone. After a short \"Drums\" it's onto the meat of this show with \"The Other One>Wharf Rat>The Other One>The Wheel\" that closes down the second set in pretty great Dead fashion as this is what I want to hear from this bunch of pirates and it explains why folks like me call this band special.\n\nThe encores are \"Around and Around\" and \"Johnny B. Goode\" and the winner is the almost ten minute 'Around' with it's stop\/start teases and and real long playout by Jerry as it has that X-Factor as more than great and in a three hour span of music that is full of peaks and valleys it is a mountaintop of great live music. This isn't my favorite show from my favorite year of Grateful Dead music but this well-produced set that a fan of The Dead would really enjoy.\n\nThis is available at the band's official website (for a lot less $$$!) and a run of 12,000 of these sets are to be produced over there. My copy is numbered: 941, and  four live sets are due to be released in 2012 of this new series. The CD's are held in hard plastic shells and not from the hard paper sleeves package as they were in the \"Road Series\" series so the requests\/screams of the fans have been listened to at the GD\/Rhino Corporation as the packaging has improved greatly here.\nFour Stars!","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"If you're new to Red Fang and their music, I think the easiest way to describe them is to compare them to the Melvins.  Their style of sludge metal\/stoner rock is very similar, though they have a much more serious edge to their lyrics.  They've described their music as being for head-thinkers as well as head-bangers, and I would wholeheartedly agree.  There is a level of social commentary to their lyrics that cannot be ignored, and it serves them well.\n\nWhat we have here are three acoustic versions of songs available on two of their full-length albums, \"Murder the Mountains\" and \"Whales and Leeches.\"  Following the acoustic versions are the original album versions, provided perhaps in an attempt to establish greater contrast between the two versions.  Either way, these songs kick some serious ass.\n\nThe session starts with \"Failure,\" which can be found on the band's most recent album, \"Whales and Leeches.\"  The two songs that follow--\"Human Herd\" and \"Malverde\"--can be found on their sophomore album, \"Murder the Mountains.\"  Both albums are available on Relapse Records, and I strongly recommend you check out this free EP if you're at all interested in the music of Red Fang.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Now I have a feeling that following the disappointing reception of his debut album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Steve-Winwood\/dp\/B001GHSFMQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Steve Winwood<\/a>&nbsp;three years earlier that some refinements had to be made in order for Winwood to become as commercially successful as he was creatively so. One of the major ones was is that he would need to put some distance between some of the more progressive melodic\/harmonic instincts he might've developed during his Traffic period. Also he might've also had the sense that,although strongly synergistic with musicians such as Jim Capaldi,that as a multi instrumental Winwood was more in the position to instrumentally carry his follow up album on his own He also added another element to the mix along with Viv Stanshall. And that was the presence of the apparently more pop radio friendly lyricist Will Jennings. The result was this album-one which held the hopes within it for the future of Steve Winwoods musical future as a solo artist.\n\n  \"While You See A Chance\" proved to be the huge pop hit Winwood was looking for. With its strongly layered synthesizers and strong pop craft and construction? This is essentially an electronic\/new wave re-imagining of the uptempo gospel\/soul he started doing from the outset. The title song is similarly layered in Stevie Wonder-like washes of synthesizers on a funky Caribbean style mid tempo number. \"Second Hand Human\" is a hugely melodic,chiming synthesizer heavy pop\/pop number in the same league as the hit that led off the album. Starting off as a melodic,folksy ballad \"Slowdown Sundown\" gets into dance floor friendly and funky groove on the refrains. \"Spanish Dancer\" has a beautifully liquidy sound with bubbling synthesizers and a harmonically subterranean melody. \"Night Train\" is a sleekly electronic jazz\/funk jam while the dynamic ballad \"Dust concludes the album.\n\n  To my way of thinking? Debating over which song I like better on this album serves no purpose. Winwood didn't merely make an album here with a hit or two and just filled it out. He constructed a creatively potent album that mixed his classic blue eyed soul approach with modern post disco\/new wave synthesizer touches. And the way in which he used synthesizers were creative and highly distinctive. He was one of a scant few pop musicians who was able to create an enormous sense of warmth and feeling out of them. I include Prince and Stevie Wonder in with that too. Although this album does have its detractors for that very reason among some of the less tolerant followers of the \"keeping it real\" music critic brigade? It would be very difficult to debate how much this album successfully extended on what was started on Winwood's commercially failed debut album and actually began an entirely new and fruitful career for him as a solo artist with a lot to say.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"There has been a lot of competition among metal bands these past few years, and so many of the bands offer nothing at all new to the metal scene. Plus, it doesn't necessarily make it easier if your band is from Sweden, because there are also several Swedish metal bands (i.e. Arch Enemy, Meshuggah, In Flames, etc.)\n\nBefore I heard their music, I had Soilwork pegged as just another metalcore band; but then, on an impulse buy, I gave \"Stabbing the Drama\" a listen. And when I did, I was very pleasantly surprised. This C.D. isn't 100% new or innovative, but it's melodic, and that's quite refreshing in this day and age.\n\nThe guitars are fiery and crunchy, but the vocals are what make these songs pleasing to the ears. Singer Bjorn Strid doesn't quite have a soulful voice, but it is tuneful and quite impressive. He switches back and forth between angry and aggressive to harmonic and clean. Sometimes, as is the case with tracks five and six, he can sing melodically even when the backing music is heavy.\n\nThe title track is a personal favorite because it has rapid stop-start riffs and drumming which is vaguely reminiscent of a jackhammer.\n\"One With the Flies\" is a punching rhythm with cascading riffs, and a nice, melodic guitar solo.\n\"Weapon of Vanity\" has scorching, blowtorch riffs, and \"Nerve\" begins with thunderous guitar noise and dreary vocals.\n\"Stalemate\" has a sprinting rhythm with running riffs and fast, thumping drums.\n\"Observation Slave\" has a lot of clean singing (some of the vocals sound distant), alongside riffs which are extra crunchy.\n\"Blind Eye Halo\" features grooving riffs, fast snare drumming, and back-to-back guitar solos.\nFinally, \"If Possible,\" has more fast, surging, stop-start, punching riffs, but it ends with some light guitar plucking.\n\nThere's one thing that drags this C.D. down, which is that most of the songs follow the same structure: raging vocals in the verses and singing clearly for the chorus. This structure becomes quite repetitive and predictable, but all in all, I'm very glad I decided to give this C.D. a shot, because it is much more than typical metalcore. Soilwork deserve to have much success with it, because \"Stabbing the Drama\" makes the band stand out among other modern metal bands. So, if you've given up on In Flames, and you're not sure which other metal bands to listen to (since there are so many), I definitely recommend you give \"Stabbing the Drama\" a shot.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Patsy Cline (born Virginia Patterson Hensley, September 8, 1932 - March 5, 1963) was a superbly gifted country music singer--very few could, can or ever will match her ability to take any tune and make it sound wonderful, special, fresh and very new! Patsy also put her heart and soul into everything she sang; and that's grand. Sadly, she died so young in a private plane crash; but at least she lives on through her music. This is an excellent CD of her artistry for both fans and newcomers alike.\n\nThere's not a single dud in the lot here; every song is just that good! \"Walkin' After Midnight,\" written by  Alan Block and Donn Hecht, is a fine way to start the track set--Patsy is squarely front and center which is right where she belongs! The music, as is the case with all the tracks here, fits in perfectly with Patsy's vocals. \"A Poor Man's Roses (Or a Rich Man's Gold)\" is very well done and Patsy does a great job on \"Lovesick Blues\" which is a number I really like. \"I Fall to Pieces\" (Pasty's first #1 hit on the country charts and her second hit on the pop charts) and \"True Love\" from Patsy's 1961 album entitled \"Patsy Cline Showcase\" are most poignant and Patsy sings \"San Antonio Rose\" with panache--I love it! \"Crazy,\" a number by Willie Nelson, shines bright in Patsy's more than capable hands; it's her signature song despite the fact that she didn't like it at all initially!\n\n\"Strange\" is very well done--there's some backup vocals for Patsy and while they do sound pretty good Patsy never really needed backup; her talent carried her through every time! Patsy's interpretation of Hank Cochran's \"She's Got You\" is very impressive; and Patsy's \"Heartaches\" is easily the very best I've ever heard! \"Half As Much\" is easy on the ear even if the lyrics aren't all that happy while \"When I Get through with You (You'll Love Me Too)\" is certainly more upbeat. \"Imagine That\" gets a fine treatment from Patsy and \"So Wrong\" yet again features Patsy's beautiful contralto voice. \"Why Can't He Be You\" is another moving number.\n\n\"Leavin' on Your Mind\" is an incredibly fine tune that gets the royal treatment from Patsy Cline and \"When You Need a Laugh\" is a real gem! \"Back in Baby's Arms\" has a great sound to it as do the other numbers here and songs like \"Faded Love\" make me wish so badly that Patsy was still with us. \"Always\" is a classic for sure and the album ends with two splendid songs, Harlan Howard's \"He Called Me Baby\" and Don Gibson's \"Sweet Dreams (Of You).\"\n\nPatsy Cline shared so much of her gift with us that we are all better off for it. I highly recommend her exceptional music.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Well he we are, nine months after the extremely versatile and talented Mr. Ryan Leslie dropped his long awaited debut album in Feb. of 09, and its now November of 09 and hes already delivered his sophomore set, Transition. And while Transition does have a bit of the \"Rushed\" vibe, it still doubles as a solid follow up to a great debut album, from this longtime R&B producer turned singer\/songwriter. The best thing about Transition, compared to his last album is that it sounds a lot more focused. And its kind of ironic how his near classic debut album took approximately four years to record and finally release, and now his sophomore album only took Nine months to record and release with no pushbacks. Thats the definition of being efficient.  While Leslies voice isn't grade A, he still knows how to use it effectively without coming off as corny or fake... most of the time anyways. Like on the extremely corny and just flat out embarrassing \"Zodiac\" and the miserable attempt at a babymaker \"All My Love\". But most of the time on the album, Leslie's futuristic and sparse production is able to carry the music despite his lackluster vocals in certain areas of the album. Like on the very Neptunish sounding \"Something That I Like\", Ryan kills the track with his slick flows over a beat that sounds like it could have been pulled right off of Clipse's Hell Hath No Fury album. And \"Never Gonna Break Up\" has a very dreamy mid tempo beat, complete with Ryan Leslie's signature crooning style of singing, but again its the production that truly shines on this track. But on \"Guardian Angel\" its Leslie's vocals that shine on the track instead of the beat, even though the beat is pretty good too, its a track that Ryan Leslie actually sounds 100% convincing with his vocals on the track. And on the very futuristic sounding \"Sunday Night\" Ryan shows us why he is a very in demand producer, despite the song having some weak lyrics. But in order for this album to be truly worth the purchase, go to Best Buy to buy the album because they have a limited edition of the album that has three great bonus tracks, and a honestly kind of lame DVD. But the three bonus tracks are all worth the extra 2 dollars. One of those bonus cuts is the mid tempo ballad \"Promise Not 2 Call\" which has become one of Ryan Leslies infamous youtube videos, where he produces and records a song while video taping the whole process. If you haven't seen that video, youtube it, cuz it's pretty cool. And the very contemporary sounding \"Rescue U\" is another standout track on the album. But overall, Transition isn't quite as good as his self titled debut album, but it serves as a really solid follow up album.

{"text":"This is a really strong good album, it has it's share of somber tracks and fun tracks, and the sad tracks don't make the album boring at all. It's one of the few country albums I can listen to all the way through without being bored. The stories being told on this album are all good down to earth songs. Miranda Lambert fans will love this album. The only thing is that it's a bit short, 30 min long. They really don't come off like the bad girls they're trying to pose as, they definitely come off more cutesy and charming on this album. You have more old country sounding songs to modern radio country pop tracks, but they work together well. There is only 1 curse word on the cd, so don't buy it at Walmart for it may be censored if you can't stand censoring.

{"text":"My old friend from the 1960s great American hitchhike highway, Peter Paul Markin (then consciously carrying the moniker of Be-Bop Benny), really was the first person who tuned me into the world of blues, old time country blues (driven by the Saturday juke joints), and the later post-World War II electrification of the blues as blacks headed north to the cities- and electricity. He got me, a small city Maine boy, hip to the likes of Son House, Skip James, Bessie Smith, Memphis Minnie, Muddy Waters, and Howlin' Wolf. All unabashedly raw talent, and all out front down deep blues, country or city.\n\nOf course that was over forty years ago and almost all of those who he hipped me too have now passed on, although not their musical influence and that is what brings me to this review, Alligator Records: 40th Anniversary Collection 2 CD set. Since the blues are still very much with us, although that genre, like rock and roll, has it up and down periods of popularity it is necessary to take a peek at who has carried on the traditions that Be-Bop Benny started me out on when we travelled those West Coast highways seeking the great American West night.\n\nAnd that is where the Alligator Record label comes in. In earlier times certain record companies were known, and well-known, for certain kinds of music. Chess Record sin Chicago comes readily to for electric blues. As does Sun Records for early rock (and rockabilly). And Vanguard Records for folk stuff. Well Alligator has filled a certain niche for those who wished to carry on the electric blues tradition and this 38 performance collection set is testimony to those efforts for the last forty -something years.\n\nWhile they may have recoded for other recoding companies or had other label arrangements (not uncommon in the helter-skelter world of record production) the artists list here constitute something  of \"who's who\" of post-1960s electric blues. A small roll call of names like Koko Taylor, Albert Collins, Guitar Shorty, Marcia Ball, Son Seal, Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Johnny Winter, Lonnie Brooks, Hound Dog Taylor, James Cotton and the rest make my case. The only question that I have is who will produce the next generation of blues material?  Alligator Records efforts here are the new benchmark.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"So...like many other Volbeat fans, I awaited the release of this album with great anticipation. The first early release track \"The Devil's Bleeding Crown\" was a good track...not their greatest work...but good. The next early release track \"The Bliss\" is a bit on the easier side. I felt like this track would easily be the \"Lola Montez\" of this new album. It's an OK song but I'm a fan of the heavier Volbeat songs as well as the rockabilly inspired pieces. Seal the Deal followed as the third early release track and again...it's OK and left me wondering what was going to happen with the rest of the album because so far I was not liking the trend. When the rest of the album dropped last week I immediately listened to it from beginning to end like I do all of my new releases. However, unlike every other Volbeat release which all commanded a second and third (and many more) beginning-to-end listening streak...after the first listen I was pretty much done with Seal the Deal. I read an interview before the album release where Michael Poulson stated this was going to be more of a rock album and would not feature the varied stylings previous albums were known for.\nWhile it is true this is a rock album...Seal the Deal leaves so much to be desired. As a diehard fan I have to admit I'm a fan of almost everything Volbeat does...except this album. I really feel like this album is to Volbeat what \"Load\" was to Metallica. It feels very commercial and very \"accessible\" to a mainstream audience but not to the fans of what Volbeat is truly capable of. This is not coming from a place of hatred for the album or the band when I tell you that many of the songs sound the same and are very difficult to tell from one another. Even my wife, who is not a big metal listener (but is a huge Volbeat fan) is very disappointed with this album.\nI don't understand this change of direction at a time when this band is becoming so huge and popular and that popularity is based on what this band has done with their previous five releases.\nGive the samples a listen and decide for yourself. But for me this album will not be on my Volbeat playlist.","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"I was a slow comer to Linkin Park. When they emerged with the other nu-metal bands I didn't find them particularly distinguishable from the others. I figured they were another flash in the pan, one hit wonder. I was wrong. One thing they've proven throughout the course of their career is reliability in good song writing, and impressive chemistry as bandmates. The Hunting Party lacks gimmickry, and is probably the first album they've done that feels like it's just a band playing together. No loops, no electronica, no excessive polish. It all sounds like a band got together in a room and knocked out some killer, high energy tunes.\n\nThe Hunting Party has the best of Linkin Park - Big, hooky singalong choruses, rap\/singing structures, and a new innovation for them...raw, unvarnished grit. This here is straight forward, blast the stereo speakers RAWK. Perhaps the biggest letdown is the instrumental track with Tom Morello, which showcases absolutely nothing of Morello's skills. You'd never know that was Tom Morello playing if it weren't for the liner notes.\n\nSmall gripe. Everything on here is quality otherwise. Linkin Park has served up a refreshing nugget of pure rock, filling a void in a genre gasping for relevance. Hats off to them for the risky move with a big payoff.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"The Essential Cyndi Lauper really should have been a two CD set. While we get a good number of her biggest hits on this album, there isn't quite enough to satisfy me. Although the material that we do get is wonderful; where are some more very good tunes? At any rate, Cyndi worked hard to produce great music for her fans; and just one listen to this album proves it. In addition, the quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is very well done.\n\n\"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\" starts the CD off with a huge number that was one of Cyndi's earliest hits. \"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\" celebrates women who just want to enjoy their relationships with men without long term commitments; and Cyndi delivers this like a pro! The number is full of positive energy and it's great music for dancing even today. \"Money Changes Everything\" was another early hit for Cyndi; this has that mid `80s dance flavor to it and Cyndi's really good diction enhances the number even more. \"Who Let In The Rain\" features Cyndi front and center--right where she belongs! \"Who Let In The Rain\" is a fine number that proves Cyndi can easily tackle a rock flavored ballad to make it take flight!\n\n\"She Bop\" was always one of my very favorite Cyndi Lauper hits; this hit the airwaves big time during the summer of 1984 and I remember going to dances where the DJs played this very often. \"She Bop\" has a great, power-packed melody that is also rather catchy and it remains one of Cyndi Lauper's best hits ever. \"Time After Time\" also comes from the mid 1980s; and Cyndi does this wonderfully. \"I Drove All Night\" comes from Cyndi's great album entitled A Night To Remember and just one listen proves that Cyndi is a champ! \"Hat Full Of Stars\" is a ballad from the album of the same name; and listen for \"All Through The Night.\" \"All Through The Night\" is one of Cyndi Lauper's best hits ever--period. The percussion enhances the musical arrangement and Cyndi's excellent diction makes her performance even better. \"All Through The Night\" is another one of my very favorite Cyndi Lauper tunes and it deserves its place on this CD.\n\n\"When You Were Mine\" comes from Cyndi's first album entitled She's So Unusual; and Cyndi's cover of the song originally done by Prince really shines bright. \"True Colors\" comes from the album of the same; Cyndi does this with great sensitivity and the guitar work enhances the melody quite a bit. Awesome! \"Unhook The Stars\" plays with major and minor keys as Cyndi sings this very well; and the album ends strong with a great number from the movie The Goonies entitled \"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough.\" I agree with other reviewers who write that this last number is a most welcome addition to this album.\n\nI always liked Cyndi Lauper; so while I love the tunes on this album I must admit that it's not as complete as it should be. There should be several other songs here. Specifically, I would have wanted extra songs like \"Hole In My Heart (All The Way To China);\" \"My First Night Without You;\" \"Ballad Of Cleo & Joe;\" \"Boy Blue\" and maybe even one or two more. That's a missed opportunity; and I can only hope that we get a better Cyndi Lauper \"essential\" collection two CD set soon. Nevertheless, I still recommend this album for Lauper's fans; and it makes a great starter CD for people just discovering Cyndi's talents. It's also a fine CD for people who merely want a small sampling of Cyndi Lauper's incredible artistry.","classification":4,"fold":8}

Despite that album being pretty alright, for most Baroness fans the record ended up disappointing quite a few due to its softer sound. If you're hoping that the band goes back to their more heavier sound that they had with their first 2 records then you may still be disappointed. However, I encourage you to give this album a chance because it improves with what they were trying to do with their last album and the result is great. You can tell the band really fleshed out with the new sound they are trying to capture and it thankfully comes off heavy as you want it to be. Despite them softening their sound, this album still has that heavy hitting moments that got me into this band in the first place. If you're a new fan or an old one, this album is most certainly worth checking out.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"This is a very cool album. Jewel has been taking a lot of heat for it and I don't really see what all of the fuss is about. It's not really all that different from the direction she had seemed to be taking with \"This Way.\" Remember \"Serve the Ego?\" Remember \"Standing Still?\" The tracks from \"0304\" aren't all that different. The production is just taken up a notch. Obviously Jewel has done something right because of the first single \"Intuition\" has become her biggest radio hit since \"Hands\" back in '98.\n\"Inuition\" is definitely one of the star tracks of the album. Jewel has taken her lyrics and put them to a great pop beat and sound. \"Run 2 U\" is a stand-out also and is very catchy. My personal favorite *at least as of now* is \"Fragile Heart.\" It's a light-hearted ballad and would make a great single. This is the Jewel I love! *who couldn't love that whistle?* \"Leave the Lights On\" and \"Haunted\" are the most unique songs and have a love\/hate style about them. If you liked \"Standing still\" from \"This Way\" then you'll probably like \"Doin' Fine.\" \"Yes U Can\" is definitely another potential single. Like \"Intuition,\" it's a dance track *originally written for Santana* but I'm glad Jewel got to do it. This would be a great club single. \"2 Become 1\" is a love song similar to the title track from \"This Way.\" It's a beautiful song as are all of Jewel's love songs. \"Yes U Can\" is another fun dance track. \"America\" is a more serious track with some ear-catching lyrics.\nDon't knock Jewel for wanting to lighten up and experiment with her music. True fans would respect her for wanting to try different styles. And who cares about her image change? So she's wearing a dress...get over it! She's hot, let her have her fun. The music's great. As far as her comparisons to the newly reformed teen divas, Jewel's talent in all its aspects *vocals, lyrics, song-writing*  makes them look like Milli Vanilli wannabes.

{"text":"I own most of the Vanguard Big Box downloads. They're hard to resist when one gets anywhere from 6 to 14 hours of music for 99.\n\nBut this set is special, as it features violinist\/conductor Willi Boskovsky in the majority of the tracks. That would be the same Boskovsky who led the Vienna Philharmonic New Year's Day Concerts for all those years (up thru 1979, I believe).\n\nAnd, that Vienna State Opera Orchestra in this Big Box would be the Vienna Philharmonic by a different name (ie: the Vienna Philharmonic is the name the Vienna State Opera Orchestra adopts when it takes leave of the opera house pit and relocates to the concert stage).\n\nI've listened to only a few of the tracks so far, so I can't say that - beyond a few mislabeled tracks I've already encountered - this set doesn't contain additional irritating mistakes\/glitches\/face plants that typically plague the efforts of the Bach Guild and their Big Boxes. But for 99, it's hard to be too hard on them, even if it would seem that getting it right takes no more effort than getting it wrong.\n\nBTW - the title of this BB is misleading as not all of the pieces in this collection are waltzes. There are plenty of polkas, mazurkas, galops etc included, which is all for the good, IMHO. In addition to the expected selections by the Strauss family, the download also includes music by Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Lanner and others.\n\nRecommended.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I loved Funeral and thought Neon Bible was very good.  I have listened to this numerous times since its release and so far it feels like a classic.  I hear new things every time---the songs are complex, nuanced, and beautiful.\n\nSome of the other reviews on here are driving me nuts.  These run the gamut from pretentious reviews comparing this band to the second coming of Alternative Music (i.e., exaggerated hyperbole) to reviews that rip them for being derivative of other bands (there is even a positive review on here that compares every song to other bands...\"this song is U2 meets REM\", \"this is Springsteen and New Order\" etc.).\n\nThe fact is, ALL bands are influenced by their peers (and by music they grew up with and loved).  There really is NO completely original music around anymore free of all previous influences (not sure that there ever was!).  So for me to point out that Arcade Fire rips some of their chord progressions right out of Pixies songs or that Win Butler at times sounds like a cross between David Bowie, Black Francis (Frank Black), and David Byrne...well, what's the point? The fact is, Arcade Fire are currently one of the most eclectic and ambitious bands around.  I like how they can take what sounds like a simple pop song on the surface (\"Modern Man\", for instance) and fill it up with meaning and pathos and lots of little musical touches.  And I love how they are respectful of their influences---yes, there are many nods to new wave bands of the 80's on here---but no, they are NOT derivative.\n\nThis album is probably a tad long, but its hard to complain when the music is this good.  The songs have been dancing in my head for days and, just like Funeral, I am guessing that the meaning and depth behind them will continue to emerge over time.  These guys really write songs that get into your subconscious---I mean, right now all I have to do is think of the movie \"Where the Wild Things Are\" and I can immediately hear the music and words for \"Wake Up\" in my head.\n\nIf you have any appreciation at all for their past work, get this album---it's a good one.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"\"Ain't No Sunshine\" by Bill Withers has been covered a lot. Everyone from Nancy Sinatra to Michael Jackson has a version. Each is magnificent. And like Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah,\" they all are an homage stylistically to the original. Whether presented as deep southern blues or blue-eyed soul, it works.\n\nIt is a sad song. Taken in its own context, a guy is singing about a woman he loves. She's young, probably under 18, and really doesn't deserve his love. She's gone often, and each time unexpectedly. He knows in his heart she's using him, but he can't let go.\n\nHe repeats, \"I know,\" almost metronomically, as he argues with himself about their love. But he keeps coming back to the refrain, that she's the brightest thing in his depressing life. There is, for him, no sunshine when she's gone.\n\nWithers knows his song. He aches as he sings it. You believe him when he sings, \"And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away.\" Your heart will break as you think of those you have loved along the way.\n\nI fully recommend \"Ain't No Sunshine\" by Bill Withers. It is among the best songs you'll ever hear.\n\nAnthony Trendl\nAmericanSpeechwriter.com","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"When you pause to consider Linda Ronstadt's entire body of work over a period of four decades it it difficult not to come to the conclusion that Linda really is one of the great singers of the past half century. She is more than capable of singing all manner of material from rock and roll to country to tunes from the Great American Songbook.\n\nIn 1965 Linda Ronstadt moved to Los Angeles and was a founding member of the Stone Poneys. Within a relatively short period of time the group signed a recording contract with Capitol records and in 1967 had a pretty impressive Top 20 hit with a tune called \"Different Drum\". Linda did a terrific job singing lead on that record and Capitol decided that they had a potential star on their hands. In 1970, Linda Ronstadt would have her very first hit as a solo artist. The song \"Long Long Time\" remains my very favorite Ronstadt tune of all time. Here is the most poignant song about the pain of unrequited love that you will ever hear. I still get chills each and every time I hear it.  Without a doubt a five star performance.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"No heavy metal band was as consistently great in the 1980's as Iron Maiden and Somewhere in Time is another strong album from the British band. This was released in 1986 when some of the traditional heavy metal bands (most notably Judas Priest) started experimenting with keyboards or guitar synthesizers. While this style didn't work for Priest (who overdid the guitar synthesizers to the point of making them sound like a pop band), it worked for Iron Maiden because they used this sound more for color rather than making it their foundation. \"Wasted Years\" would be the first single\/video and is one of their best as it has a memorable guitar line and dare I say, a very catchy chorus. The mid-tempo \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" was nearly as good and has become one of their best deep cuts. \"Caught Somewhere In Time\" was another in a long line of musically challenging opening cuts performed at a frenetic pace (the band's opening tracks were the best of the genre, bar none). The highlights continue throughout the album as \"Sea of Madness\" is a riveting track that slows down briefly before coming back harder while \"Heaven Can Wait\" starts out quite somber with Steve Harris's bass synth line before becoming a classic metal track that changes tempos throughout yet it all fits. Other highlights include the killer epic \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\" and the wicked unison guitar lines that carry \"Dj Vu\". The last track, \"Alexander the Great\", while musically ambitious, doesn't touch the rest of the album.  All told, Somewhere in Time is another strong album from a band that had a ton of them.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"The Shakes' last recording was pretty impressive, and presumably very successful, as the many studio manipulations employed on \"Sound and Color\" surely made production expensive. At the same time, this talented band cuts through the manipulations here and there, and midway on the album are 3 or 4 dynamite songs, a couple with faster tempo, that show the better side of the Shakes, I think. In fact, the second half of the record is better than the first half.\n\nTheir last album \"Boys and Girls\" is pretty organic soul and blues influenced music with a unique Shakes twist, and hints of the 70s bluesy rock of Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company. I was really looking forward to this new issue, being a bit disappointed initially. But the essence of this core sound still comes through with patient listening. I'd suggest cutting to track 6 a few times and listening through. But for my taste, production is far too heavy-handed in most of the first half, and is too remote from the organic core that makes the Shakes an exceptional group.\n\nBut looking at it from this end of the stereo needle is much different from the conceptualizing, writing and recording end, and it has to be a challenge to develop a unique sound as a band, and particularly as a blues\/rock band, to stay fresh and not become predictable and staid. The last recording by the Black Keys is also heavy on the production effects to the point of obscuring their sound, but after much listening, I'd say it's outstanding. Presumably production capabilities have grown by leaps and bounds, as this seems to be a trend currently.\n\nSo, there's some good stuff on \"Sounds and Color\", and hopefully this daring jump into electronica helps them find more inspiration and helps refine a somewhat different identity that is still a showcase for their talent, and doesn't sublimate it in a blur of electronic loops and echoes. I feel no need to have all my favorite bands transition to music from outerspace. Some of us just crave unique and powerful rock and roll, a sound that's Earth-born, and helps keep it turning.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"After forty years, the Gibb Brothers have finally re-released their most classic and eclectic of albums, \"Odessa\".  Released at the height of their first popularity and the start of their ultimate eighteen-month breakup, these three musicians, barely out of their teens, produced their only double studio album.  Originally coated in a red velvet cover, this is one of the most extravagant re-releases to date.  Originally seventeen songs, varying from the near operatic, \"Odessa (City On The Black Sea)\" to country flavored tunes like, \"Marley Purt Drive\" and \"Give Your Best\", the Gibbs cover nearly every style of pop music available, including rock, orchestral, country and R&B.\n\nOriginally slated to be titled, \"An American Opera\" or \"Masterpeace\", this double album epitomizes the height of talent of the Bee Gees boundless creativity.  In addition to two new studio songs, \"Pity\" and \"Nobody's Someone\", there are alternate and demo mixes that will surprise in their originality, beat and alternate verses.  \"Edison\", \"Lamplight\", First Of May\" and \"Whisper, Whisper\" all are given special treatment, sometimes twice.  \"Whisper, Whisper\" is actually Part Two, a welcome addition to a song that originally ended too quickly on a fast, rock driven pace.\n\nOf the three discs (57 songs), the stereo had been remixed\/remastered to absolute, crystal clear perfection, bringing out all the muffled sounds that the original LP contained.  The Mono mixes present the songs with emphasis on different vocals and instruments, while the third disc contains all the previously unreleased material.\n\nFan Joe Brennan of website \"Gibb Songs\" has this great explanation of Stereo vs. Mono recordings:  \"Odessa was recorded on 1-inch 8-track tape reels.  Each of the 8 tracks can be played separately, and each might have the input from one or more microphones.  Each of the 8 could be recorded at different times and places (like New York and London), or erased and re-recorded.  To make stereo, you have to mix down to 2 tracks, and for mono, mix down to 1 track.  While doing this you get to decide how relatively loud each track should be.  That's where the differences come from.  The source is the same 8 track master.  Mono was for old record players, and for AM radio, which was where you heard the latest tunes on your transistor radio or car radio\".\n\nWith three discs, a poster, extensive liner notes, photographs of the group, handwritten lyrics, single covers and reel-to-reel listings, a T-Shirt and a sticker all enclosed in a nifty red velvet covered box, this limited edition is a fan and collector's dream.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"3 stellar albums back to back, Kendrick Lamar is already becoming one of the greatest MC's of all time. Without a doubt in my mind, Kendrick Lamar has cemented himself in the music industry and has proven to be damn near unstoppable at this point. To Pimp A Butterfly was the best reviewed album of 2015 as well as winning him a ton of awards. This release was something I was anticipating after seeing his untitled performances on late night talk shows so I knew something like this was going to happen and I am happy he decided to release these gems to the masses. All of these songs are \"unfinished\" songs with open concepts. Half of the tracklisting lack traditional musical structures with no hooks. These songs are considered to be the B-Sides of TPAB, and sonically they are in resonance with the concept of To Pimp A Butterfly, right down to the constant \"PIMP PIMP!\" chants scattered throughout this compilation.\n\nThe themes on every one of these songs have a sense existentialism, racism, classicism, and vanity. While all of these songs are meant to be stand-alone tracks, they still flow cohesively. The guest features are scarce but are welcomed additions to the album including SZA, Jay Rock, Punch, Anna Wise, Bilal, Thundercat and Cee-Lo Green. The production on the album ranges from Jazz, Soul, Funk and even a bit of Pop sprinkled on top. Untitled 1, 3 and 7 remains my favorite tracks with incredible flows and lyrics. The only complaint I have with this album is the last section of \"untitled 7\". untitled 7 is broken down into 3 sections, the first part being the catchy \"Levitate\" portion while the 2nd part containing an impressive 20 bar verse. However, the last portion of the song is a \"Jam session\" running 3 minutes long...stylistically I believe Kendrick was shooting for a Bob Marley vibe with this part, and I understand that it was supposed to be a track not to be taken seriously, but in my opinion this part messed up the flow of the album for me. Overall this compilation was fantastic and I commend Kendrick for not releasing BS for commercial gain. The fact that his leftover songs still maintain the same high-quality of his albums is just incredible.\n\nFavorite 5:\n1) untitled 03\n2) untitled 07\n3) untitled 01\n4) untitled 05\n5) untitled 06","classification":5,"fold":8}

Still, it is interesting to listen once again to the guys when they were at the height of their musical powers (and as high, most of the time, as Georgia pines). This album from the tail end of their most creative period , moreover, unlike let us say Bob Dylan who has produced more creative work for longer, is the `golden era\" of the Stone Age. The album, however, is a little uneven in spots reflecting, I think, a certain exhaustion of material that they could call their totally their own unless the time when they owned a big chunk of rock 'n'roll in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The age of a more sedate music (at least technically) was approaching and I think there was some confusion about whether to embrace it or \"spoof\" it.

Tonight Jamie who sings at the Hard Rock Lobby Bar in Tampa sang a song called  Grown -up Christmas List- I honestly have never heard this song before and I simply started crying, tears were flowing. Though it has been recorded by such very talented artist as Amy Grant, Kelly Clarkson, Natalie Cole- David Foster, Clay Aiken and Michael Buble. I have always had people in my life, a friend, my family, people who I meet. As I was crying the shock of reality came over me when I realized their are people in this world who do not have family, a friend, neighbor to talk to.\n\nThese are the people who are HOMELESS. I am a person who loves to give than  recieve, but when its time to see Santa you bet that I will wish for a new friend for Christmas and it will be on the top of my list.\n\nThis world is scary these days with everyone fighting, struggling during these hard times, jobless, finacial difficulty and no peace in the world.\n\nTo all of you: May you have a wonderful Holiday\nLove, Roberta","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"When it has came down to Pharrell Williams, he had some great songs both behind the scenes, and with his work on his own with N.E.R.D. This year so far, he hit a massive nerve with the feel-good song Happy from Despicable Me 2. But with a smash song, it is very hard to see a follow-up deliver just as well as the song before. Unfortunately, he didn't have that strength with his latest single, Come Get It Bae, the second single from his latest album G.I.R.L. I didn't find the song to really hit the nail on the head, and felt more like a weak knock off to Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines in the sound. It is alright, but if you have one good feel-good song to go to, just stick with getting Happy on your MP3 Player, and download that and you'll be Happy enough. Come Get It Bae, not strong enough.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":8}

Everything has to fall into place. It's not just, \"is every song good?\" It's more than that. It's the right artist at the right time with the right circumstances and attitude. 10 years down the line will people hear the songs And sing all the words?. People have been throwing around the term \"classic\" nowadays practically right when the album comes out. Nah man. Kendrick hasn't dropped a classic. Wayne never dropped one either. Nobody has put out anything like 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Trying. His story was crazy, his time dropping mix tapes as if they were albums was crazy. He was jacking beats like it was nothing and making dope songs. His confidence and sense of humor got people. Then, Eminem and Dre signed him and got right to work making this. Everything was just perfect looking back on it. Say what you want about him now lol but 50 dropped a certified banger and a classic that we'll always remember him by.","classification":5,"fold":8}

I first heard the name on MSNBC's Reality TV questions column, before the song's monumental success. Soon after that column, the song rocketed up the charts, and while I don't think it #1, it came pretty darn close, and still remains a download favorite a couple years later.\n\nThe song itself is good, not great. The vocals match and work with the song, the lyrics are good, and the piano works very well with the song. However, it kind of gets sappy after awhile. And again, after the radio long wheres out it's welcome, you're cursing the radio to stop playing that darn song.\n\nSo overall, a nice song, but it'll where on you after awhile, but it'll stay long after it's welcome, so beware.

I understand the three are pushing 70 years old and it's sad to admit but, this is arguably bad. The instrumentation is great but the vocals (mainly Stills) are so hoarse and out of tune it's hard to truly enjoy what you're listening to.

I enjoyed the singing voice, but honestly, the entire piece just got too loud for me and took me right out of the mood that it started with.  However, there are a good many of you that like just that kind of ride.

It sounds like something that was designed by a committee to hit that perfect combination of catchy, trendy and completely inoffensive. Somehow it's also gratingly annoying and sticks in your (your here being \"my\") head for days after it's been heard. It's worse than \"It's A Small World After All.\" Perhaps it's the familiarity of the \"Time Of My Life\" lyric that adds the hook, because the rest is comprised of a startlingly unoriginal dance track with generic lyrics about losing control on the dance floor and being freaky freaky, etc., which should, in theory, just blend in with the rest of the background noise. I might just walk out of the next store where I hear this playing if I am near the exit and don't have a full cart of groceries which I will have to abandon.

For Ne-Yo though, he has shown a bit more promise with sensitivity and heart in his songs. That has shown with a soft and strong Hip-Hop, yet sophistitcated style on his latest single Miss Independent, the second single from his 3rd album, Year Of The Gentleman. The song actually rings a bell on not just the lyrics, but the feeling of the song, which when you hear it, you see and feel the reasons of a mans' desire into loving a woman heart and soul. Honestly, I have to give thumbs up to Ne-Yo for at least making good rhymes and reason, than making a song that feels like a piece of garbage. That is something that acts like Rihanna, Ashanti and Jordin Sparks could really learn as a hard lesson.

{"text":"On August 10, 2005 Lucinda Williams played at the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh.  It was the last live concert that my wife and I saw together.  Lucinda was touring in support of \"Live @ the Fillmore\" & said she was writing songs for a new record.  As I recall, she played a new song she said she'd recently written, \"Everything Has Changed.\"  I preordered Lucinda's \"West\" set while my wife was still here.  Today marks the fourth week since breast cancer ripped a giant unfillable hole in my universe.  Lucinda lost her mother; and so themes of adjustment to loss not only resonate with me, they punctuate every breath I take.  I spin the CD & Lucinda's gentle aching voice comes on, \"Are you alight?\"  When people ask me that, I want to say, \"He*l no!\"  But when she sings, \"All of a sudden you went away; I hope you come back around someday; I haven't seen you in a real long time; Could you give me some kind of sign?  Are you alright?  ...Cause I've been feeling a little scared,\" it sounds like she's tapped into my inner dialogue as I look toward heaven and speak to the one I love.  What an amazing song, \"Just tell me that you're okay.\"  If this were the only song on the CD, it'd be worth it.\n\n\"Unsuffer Me\" is a grueling unflinching look at the pain of loss.  Sometimes you have to stare it in the face to get through it.  \"Anoint my head with your sweet kiss, my joy is dead; I long for bliss,\" she sings as what I assume is Dan Pettibone's electric guitar churns mercilessly.  Yet somehow the song achieves a magical dignity.  During my wife's last weeks, my daughter said to me, \"It's like watching a train wreck; you can't look away.\"  There something of that strength that comes through in Williams' music.\n\nOther cuts are also amazing.  \"Learning How to Live\" is a breakup song, adjusting to loss.  \"Fancy Funeral\" may sound a bit bizarre, but I can attest that my daddy and I had almost an exact same conversation in 2001 when my mother passed.  The sheer force of Lucinda's anger in \"Come On\" puts a smile on my face as a classic bashed-breakup song, \"Dude, you're so fired; shut up, I'm not inspired.\"  \"Words\" has Lucinda's voice, weathered, worn & laden taking comfort in something she likes best, writing a good song.\n\nYes, Lucinda has an amazing catalog of recordings from \"Happy Woman Blues\" to the self-titled record to Car Wheels & World Without Tears.  \"West\" takes a well deserved place at the table as one of her most compelling, moving works.

{"text":"I have followed Kiefer's career for many years and I am glad that he has finally embraced his greatest love--music. I understand that most people will criticize him for leaving his acting career, but I don't see it that way. Music has always been his primary interest so this is not something unusual to him. Acting is in his blood and he will never quit, but he has many talents that are just now coming to light. If you are a Kiefer fan, then give this album a chance. He expresses a lot of the emotions and feelings that he has experienced in his life. I, for one, am happy to see him embrace this side of himself.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Where do I start?  Admittedly I prefer The Dead in their early period best-so I may be partial.  And while they've certainly released many stellar shows through the years, the early stuff has a certain something later releases don't.  Maybe it's because I heard the band in the days when Pigpen was, by default the \"leader\" of the band (according to Garcia because no one else wanted the job), before Garcia had a beard-just large sideburns, and they sometimes played for free-and releases like this one are reminders of those far away fun days.  The band was still exploring tunes (like \"Playing In The Band\") that would become staples in their live shows for many years, and that \"newness\", that sparkle of acid-flash playing was wound all through the music.  This show also featured several tunes from the \"Workingman's Dead\" and \"American Beauty\" albums-both great releases.  And they were still playing some tunes from the early days, which gives this release some added depth.\n\nBut from the opening notes of \"Bertha\", that begins this set, the band is on top of things. No wasted notes, the arrangements are tight (for The Dead), and there's an excitement all through this 3 CD set.  Perhaps it's because this is only the second and third  shows that \"new guy\", Keith Godchaux, played with the band.  Perhaps it's because this was the early days  of the tour.  But whatever it is, the band's playing is great.\n\nThe first two discs are from the second night at The Auditorium, a beautiful theater in Chicago.  The third disc is \"highlights\" from the previous night, and are every bit as good as anything here.  Other recordings from this same venue can be heard on Dick's Picks 35, and Road Trips Vol. 1, No. 3, all from 1971.\n\nEvery tune has something well worthwhile hearing.  Garcia's guitar work is full of excitement, Weir's rhythm guitar is full and just right. Lesh's bass work is just beginning to have it's own identity, which grew over the years.  And Kreutzmann's drumming both propels and lays a foundation for the other players.  And now with Godchaux on piano (and only occasionally organ), the band had another foil in the band, something Garcia really wanted.  And Godchaux sounds as if he had been playing with the band for a long while-check his little fills that are just right, or his short solos that say much with few notes.  There was a short period of time when the \"core four\"  rehearsed and played as a stripped down foursome.  Knowing The Dead's penchant for recording, I wonder if we'll ever get to hear what the band sounded like as a quartet?  Now that would be interesting.\n\nDiscs One is full of great tunes-\"Bertha\", \"Loser\", \"Playing In The Band\", (a then new) \"Sugaree\", \"Cold Rain And Snow\", and a few others.  These are the tunes that stick in my mind-you may have other favorites.  But the band must have been feeling pretty good (even without Pigpen), because the energy level never dwindles, even on the slower tunes.\n\nDisc Two begins with a good \"Comes A Time\", a full sounding \"One More Saturday Night\", a great \"Ramble On Rose\", a long, (28 minute), stunning \"That's It For The Other One\", a good version of \"Deal\", and an equally fine \"Casey Jones\" and \"Johnny B. Goode\".  Again, these are highlights that stick with me as I write this-there's other gems to be heard on this disc.\n\nThe third disc are songs from the 10-21-71 show at the same venue.  Things begin with a rockin' \"Truckin'\", \"Big Railroad Blues\", and then a fine (I don't know what else to say) \"Dark Star\"\/\"Sitting On Top Of The World\"\/\"Dark Star\", and then \"Me And Bobby McGee\".  I'm fairly sure that the \"Sitting...World\" split between \"Dark Star\" is something pretty unique for the band to do.  Things wind up with a good version of \"St. Stephen\"\/\"Johnny B. Goode\".\n\nAll through the second night's concert, and parts of the first night, there's a few rough edges-but that only proves my point, that The Dead were excited and exploring their music, especially with Godchaux' great piano fills and short solos.  Garcia's playing is full of emotion and seems charged with electricity (no pun intended) no matter what the tune, and the rest of the band plays with no fuss, they just get it done like only The Grateful Dead can do.\n\nThe packaging of this \"Limited Edition\" (mine is #1,409 of 12,000) is the usual quad-fold, stiff (stiffer than some previous packaging) cardboard, with the discs snapping inside trays made from 100% recycled plastic, and a pocket for the 9 page booklet.  The essay, by long time Dead associate Blair Jackson, gives some history of the theater, a bit about The Dead's circumstances (without Pigpen or Mickey Hart) and Godchaux' joining the band, and a few words about a number of the tunes.  There's also a list of song information and and the usual band list and recording info.\n\nIt's to bad that this is a limited release.  For fans of the early Dead (like me) this is a wonderful new release, full of great music.  The mix of older tried and true songs, with \"newer\" tunes just beginning to make their appearance, the addition of Keith Godchaux, and the band's general excitement and exuberance during this era, all add up some fine music.  I only hope that the Real Gone Music label (who has a contract to reissue out of print Dead releases) will be able to re-release this for all the folks who didn't get it the first time-if you like early era Dead-it's that good.","classification":4,"fold":8}

I had to check the CD's credits to make sure Philip Bailey wasn't listed as a background vocalist, because it sure sounds like him singing \"WEE-DOO-DOO-DOO\" on this track.\n\nOn his own merits Eric Benet is a stellar A-List R&B singer with a falsetto range rivaling that of the great Philip Bailey of EWF. Indeed, Benet is a friend and colleague of Maurice White, Philip Bailey and the entire EWF family. If Philip Bailey ever decides to retire from EWF, Benet would fit in nicely as a replacement! He's certainly got the range and the vocal chops to do all the Philip Bailey-led falsetto songs of the EWF playlist ... particularly \"REASONS\"! Who else besides Eric Benet could even hope to do justice to that EWF gem? I sure would like to see Eric Benet & EWF on the same show\/tour; no matter who opens for whom!\n\nBut I digress ...\n\nOn this single, Eric Benet does more than just copy or sample the EWF flavor, he takes their whole pot of stew and adds something uniquely all his own ... the recipe really cooks ... and it works!!\n\nIt's incredulous that Eric Benet has been nominated 4 times, but has yet to win a Grammy!!

{"text":"Now I have a feeling that following the disappointing reception of his debut album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Steve-Winwood\/dp\/B001GHSFMQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Steve Winwood<\/a>&nbsp;three years earlier that some refinements had to be made in order for Winwood to become as commercially successful as he was creatively so. One of the major ones was is that he would need to put some distance between some of the more progressive melodic\/harmonic instincts he might've developed during his Traffic period. Also he might've also had the sense that,although strongly synergistic with musicians such as Jim Capaldi,that as a multi instrumental Winwood was more in the position to instrumentally carry his follow up album on his own He also added another element to the mix along with Viv Stanshall. And that was the presence of the apparently more pop radio friendly lyricist Will Jennings. The result was this album-one which held the hopes within it for the future of Steve Winwoods musical future as a solo artist.\n\n  \"While You See A Chance\" proved to be the huge pop hit Winwood was looking for. With its strongly layered synthesizers and strong pop craft and construction? This is essentially an electronic\/new wave re-imagining of the uptempo gospel\/soul he started doing from the outset. The title song is similarly layered in Stevie Wonder-like washes of synthesizers on a funky Caribbean style mid tempo number. \"Second Hand Human\" is a hugely melodic,chiming synthesizer heavy pop\/pop number in the same league as the hit that led off the album. Starting off as a melodic,folksy ballad \"Slowdown Sundown\" gets into dance floor friendly and funky groove on the refrains. \"Spanish Dancer\" has a beautifully liquidy sound with bubbling synthesizers and a harmonically subterranean melody. \"Night Train\" is a sleekly electronic jazz\/funk jam while the dynamic ballad \"Dust concludes the album.\n\n  To my way of thinking? Debating over which song I like better on this album serves no purpose. Winwood didn't merely make an album here with a hit or two and just filled it out. He constructed a creatively potent album that mixed his classic blue eyed soul approach with modern post disco\/new wave synthesizer touches. And the way in which he used synthesizers were creative and highly distinctive. He was one of a scant few pop musicians who was able to create an enormous sense of warmth and feeling out of them. I include Prince and Stevie Wonder in with that too. Although this album does have its detractors for that very reason among some of the less tolerant followers of the \"keeping it real\" music critic brigade? It would be very difficult to debate how much this album successfully extended on what was started on Winwood's commercially failed debut album and actually began an entirely new and fruitful career for him as a solo artist with a lot to say.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I am going by the strength of Prince's LotusFlow3r cd alone. The most I have heard, bro is good and I'm going to tell you, DON\"T SLEEP ON THIS!!! yes I was one of those waiting on Raspberry Beret 2010, but this stuff is great. And I don't blame him for holding on to his creativity to do his own stuff and market it via Target either. I am not happy that Prince has most of his stuff deleted off YouTube, but I guess when you had to go through a serious battle over your own name with a record label, take up a symbol, then come out of it with your sanity, I can't blame a brother not one darn bit. And the funny thing out of this, just as he talked on labels, so did Michael Jackson before he passed. But to get on to the LotusFlow3r cd, the brother is flexing his seemingly unlimited creativity with his cd; his take on Crimson and Clover, his insightful Colonized Mind, his jazzy yet naughty Love Like Jazz, and if Malcolm X was alive to hear Dreamer, he couldn't do nothing but holla. The brother is that good. And I'm sorry I slept on this. but right now at Target you can get it for $4.99 and feast your ears to something worth your time. You gotta get it and listen to one funky feast. UPDATE: I have since listened to the other two cds and feel I can say STILL the cd is worth it. Bria has a good voice personally, more like a jazzy feel. There were songs she sung made me feel I was intruding into her personal space. but she has talent. Her Kept Woman is noteworthy. All This Love is a good piece to all the sisters out there appealing to the brothers. I look forward to more offerings in the future. Prince's third set is funky and GOOD. I sense his earlier naughtiness in the first lines of Dance 4 Me. Chocolate Box keep you moving. his Valentina asks a young girl to have her mom call him when she's too busy chasing her. too smooth. His Ol Skool Company, he goes out and out and talks on politics(the bailout)as well as fellow younger artists while grooving to his funky beat. Personally this cd should have gotten more press than this. The brother haven't lost his touch and keep on rocking!!!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Modest Mouse has been a divisive band from day one. Critics, and perhaps some fans, have never been able to decide what to make of Isaac Brock's approach to making music. Modest Mouse started off as an edgy indie rock band with 1996's \"This Is A Long Drive For Someone Who Has Nothing To Think About\", and somehow morphed into a more polished major-label alternative rock band by 2004's \"Good News For People Who Love Bad News\". All the while singing discordant songs about life, love and the pursuit of pessimism. While Modest Mouse is certainly an acquired taste for the mainstream music listener, Isaac Brock's penchant for writing philosophically interesting lyrics is pretty universal.\n\nI believe that Mr. Brock decided to go on hiatus with Modest Mouse after 2007's \"We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank\" due to the increasing popularity of Modest Mouse and their musical fortunes. This was a good move, if indeed, this was the case. Eight years on, and Modest Mouse return with a different line-up and more of Isaac Brock's unique views. With each successive Modest Mouse album, Mr. Brock improves upon the previous albums, maturing, refining, honing--getting ready for his masterwork someday. When I listened to \"This Is A Long Drive For Someone With Nothing To Think About\", I reflected upon the fact that Mr. Brock was just a mere 20 years old during its making and had not yet matured into the artist found on \"Strangers To Ourselves\".\n\nAll of this is good, of course. Unless you still want Modest Mouse to remain that rough, edgy, do-it-yourself indie rock band. I don't. I want what I got with \"Strangers To Ourselves\"--a polished, meticulous, thought-provoking piece of art work.\n\nMy favorite track is the unhinged \"Pistol (A. Cunanan, Miami, FL. 1996). I don't think Mr. Brock has sounded as wildly unbalanced as he does on that track. Interestingly, I'm not sure if 1996 was an intentional mistake, or what? All of Mr. Cunanan's escapades transpired in 1997, including Miami, Florida. \"The Ground Walks, With Time In A Box\" is very catchy, and my second favorite song here. \"Ansel\" is quite interesting. \"Wicked Campaign\" is another good song. \"The Tortoise And The Tourist\" and \"The Best Room\" are both philosophically interesting tracks as well.\n\nGenerally, \"Strangers To Ourselves\" finds Modest Mouse at the top of their game thus far. Will Mr. Brock go on to create that masterwork of art in the near future? That remains to be heard. I believe he will have to reign in his discordant ways, and smooth things out musically for that to happen. Like Peter Gabriel or Talking Heads before him, they eventually found the right mix of alternative and pop and created masterworks like \"Remain In Light\", \"Little Creatures\", \"Peter Gabriel 3\" and \"So\".\n\nHere's how \"Strangers To Ourselves\" compares with Modest Mouse's previous works:\n\n1996 This Is A Long Drive For Someone With Nothing To Think About: Two and a Half Stars\n1997 The Lonesome Crowded West: Three Stars\n2000 The Moon & Antarctica: Three and a Half Stars\n2004 Good News For People Who Love Bad News: Three and a Half Stars\n2007 We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank: Three and a Half Stars\n2015 Strangers To Ourselves: Four Stars","classification":4,"fold":8}

Finally, we get the alternate edit of \"It Can't Happen Here\", which has the piano ballet interlude removed, and adds an extra line of FZ's dialog with Suzy Creamcheese.

{"text":"\"Saturate Before Using\", \"Late For The Sky\" and this album (and I suppose \"Runnin' On Empty\" too although I've yet to hear it - I can't imagine it would be bad, though) are ESSENTIAL albums to ANY music fan. EVERYTHING about these albums is perfect - the production, lyrics, musicianship, singing...etc. This makes perfect sense as Jackson was notoriously worried about getting everything perfect in the studio (and his producers rightfully got annoyed at him for that). This paid off in spades, however, as everything is crystal clear and perfect even though this was recorded in the late 60's! A cool little addition is that the first and second as well as the 9th and 10th songs flow into one another (very cool). The lyrics, as always, are extremely quotable, deep and meaningful - pretty much second only to Bob Dylan. Unlike Dylan, though, the lyrics are, like title of the album, \"For Everyman\". As opposed to \"Saturate Before Using\" and \"Late For The Sky\", \"For Everyman\" is the more consistent album - there aren't any \"bad\" songs (not that the other two had bad songs, a bunch just weren't as good as the highlights). Another cool addition is the first track, \"Take It Easy\", which is the original song which The Eagles then made into a monster hit with their cover version. If you were unsure whether you liked Jackson before, buy this album and you'll become a fan! For $9.00 this is a STEAL! Absolutely recommended!\n\nHighlights include:\nthe entire album!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"This has to be one of the best albums that the Houston rapper Paul Wall has ever released. That being said, the album's subject matter can be quite repetitive with most of the album being drugs and money, but its his pop-rap vocals and pop infused hip\/hop beats that will keep you entertained, and isn't that what an artist who been out for over a decade should aim to do. The album is filled with drug and money references and plenty of male ego (without the misogynistic of most rappers). I especially love the song \"Invisible Set Baguette\" a song bout his grillz, especially with lines like \"every time I smile my grandma catch the Holy Ghost\" and \"diamonds in my mouth dancing like Debbie Allen\". With sounds like that it's had to take this rapper too serious, but one you can listening to on your commute and enjoy the lyrics and beats.","classification":5,"fold":8}

There are a few songs out of her many songs that I'm not super in love with, but I honestly do almost love every song of hers and have all of her albums. This song is a bonus song and so it's not on my copy of 1989, and so that's why I had to get it. Some of the lyrics in this song are slightly silly.... but I still love this song!

{"text":"This latest effort by Casting Crowns is an outstanding project.  As with their other albums, it is lyrically powerful and has a great sound.\n\nThere are several very good songs on this album.  The album has a theme of challenging Christians to live their faith all the time, not just on Sunday mornings.  There are a couple of praise songs and a prayer-song included also, but most of the tracks here have a message that is very hard hitting to believers.\n\nAs with their previous albums, I think that this one will produce several hit singles.  'East To West' is already in that category.  Others that are very good include 'What The World Needs', 'Every Man', and 'Slow Fade'.\n\nI would highly recommend this to anyone who is already a fan of Casting Crowns.

Manson's voice has never sounded better; at times, he calls his inner-David Bowie, but it never sounds like he is trying to copy anyone. Rather, he's trying to be the best Manson he can be. Over 20 years after we came to know Marilyn Manson, he's somehow pulled off a masterpiece that just might be his best album ever. There's no filler and no cheap frills. From front to back, this is a phenomenal album and will go down as one of the year-s best.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Loose Windscreen's catalogue has been one of the big holes in the world of Remasters  but my God has the wait been worth it. In fact as a long-time reviewer, Bruce fan and perpetual seeker of Audio dynamite - I'd go on record right now by saying that Disc 2 in this 8CD Box Set alone - \"The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle\" - is the single most beautiful album Remaster I've ever heard bar none. This transfer (using the Plangent Process) is properly gorgeous. Suddenly an album I've known for 45 years on vinyl (and something of a hidden nugget in New Jersey's finest back catalogue) is brought to life like never before. And there are six more where that peach came from. Let's get to the details...\n\nUK and USA released 21 November 2014  \"The Album Collection, Vol. 1 - 1973-1984\" by BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN on Sony\/Legacy\/Plangent 88875014142 (Barcode 888750141422) is a 7-album\/8-CD Mini Box Set of Remasters with a 60-page booklet and plays out as follows:\n\nDisc 1 \"Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.\" (37:13 minutes):\n1.

The E Street Shuffle\n2. 4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)\n3. Kitty's Back\n4. Wild Billy's Circus Story\n5. Incident On 57th Street [Side 2]\n6. Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\n7. New York City Serenade\nTracks 1 to 7 are his 2nd album \"The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle\"  released November 1973 in the USA on Columbia KC 32432 and February 1974 in the UK on CBS Records S 65780\n\nDisc 3 \"Born To Run\" (39:29 minutes):\n1.

Badlands\n2. Adam Raised A Cain\n3. Something In The Night\n4. Candy's Room\n5. Racing In The Street\n6. The Promised Land [Side 2]\n7. Factory\n8. Streets Of Fire\n9. Prove It All Night\n10. Darkness On The Edge Of Town\nTracks 1 to 10 are his 4th studio album \"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\"  released in the USA June 1978 on Columbia JC 35318 and in the UK on CBS Records 86061  peaked at No. 3 in the USA and No. 17 in the UK.\n\nDisc 5 \"The River\" (Disc 1 of 2, 43:31 minutes):\n1. The Ties That Bind [Side 1]\n2. Sherry Darling\n3. Jackson Cage\n4. Two Hearts\n5. Independence Day\n6. Hungry Heart [Side 2]\n7. Out In The Street\n8. Crush On You\n9. You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)\n10. I Wanna Marry You\n11. The River\n\nDisc 6 \"The River\" (Disc 2 of 2, 40:17 minutes):\n1. Point Blank [Side 3]\n2. Cadillac Ranch\n3. I'm A Rocker\n4. Fade Away\n5. Stolen Car\n6. Ramrod [Side 4]\n7. The Price You Pay\n8. Drive All Night\n9. Wreck On The Highway\nDisc 5 and 6 and the double-album \"The River\"  released October 1980 in the USA on Columbia PC2 36854 and in the UK on CBS Records 88510  peaked at No. 1 in the USA and No. 2 in the UK.\n\nDisc 7 \"Nebraska\" (40:50 minutes):\n1. Nebraska\n2. Atlantic City\n3. Mansion On The Hill\n4. Johnny 99\n5. Highway Patrolman\n6. State Trooper [Side 2]\n7. Used Cars\n8. Open All Night\n9. My Fathers House\n10. Reason To Believe\nTracks 1 to 10 are the album \"Nebraska\"  released September 1982 in the USA on Columbia TC 38358 and in the UK on CBS Records 25100  peaked at No. 3 in both the USA and UK.\n\nDisc 8 \"Born In The U.S.A.\" (46:57 minutes):\n1. Born In The U.S.A.\n2. Cover Me\n3. Darlington County\n4. Working On The Highway\n5. Downbound Train\n6. I'm On Fire\n7. No Surrender [Side 2]\n8. Bobby Jean\n9. I'm Goin' Down\n10. Glory Days\n11. Dancing In The Dark\n12. My Hometown\nTracks 1 to 12 are the album \"Born In The U.S.A.\"  released June 1984 in the USA on Columbia QC 38653 and in the UK on CBS Records 86304  peaked at No. 1 on both the UK and US LP charts.\n\nYou can't argue with the quality of slightly oversized 5\" card sleeve repros  they beautifully done (not quite Japanese uber realistic but close). \"Greetings...\" has its front-flap sleeve, \"Born To Run\" its gatefold, \"Darkness...\" its Inner Sleeve and Lyric Sheet, \"The River\" has both its Inners and the gatefold lyric sheet, \"Nebraska\" its Inner Sleeve and \"Born In The U.S.A.\" its Inner Sleeve and two-sided Lyric Insert. Hell there's even a Columbia Records Advert Inner Bag with \"Greetings...\" (the seconds album \"Wild...\" didn't come with anything inside). The only tiny hiccup I can spot is the cover used for \"Nebraska\"  on the spine it has the QC 38358 catalogue number - which is technically a reissue (TC 38358 is the original as far as I'm aware). But other than that  very nicely done. The card that attaches to the outer (pull-off lid) box with track lists and reissue credits falls away once the shrink wrap is off  so that's a pain straight away. Youll end up having to put this into a plastic before it knackers itself.\n\nThe booklet is a thing of fandom beauty. There are no notes or explanations  just 60 pages of cut-outs from 1973 to 1985 covering press releases on each of the albums, singles released, concert dates. In-between all the trade adverts and reviews  there are embossed colour photos that leap off the pages  most unseen until now (a super fan's collection). There are the infamous 'Time' and 'Newsweek' covers for 1975's \"Born To Run\" in blazing colour  backstage passes and laminates  live photos  and on it goes. It's properly gorgeous stuff  and I would imagine in the format of 12\" x 12\" on the vinyl variant  Droolsome. But it would have been nice to have a second booklet with lyrics and some liner notes. But all that goes out the window once you clap your weary lugs on the stunning Audio...\n\nUsing the PLANGENT Process - a team of four have been involved - with BOB LUDWIG and TOBY SCOTT doing the lion's share of Remasters. Master tape-to-digital transfers and DSP wow and flutter reduction was carried out by JAMIE HOWARTH and JOHN K. CHESTER. I don't know much about the techno mumbo-jumbo but whatever this process does - it produces warm, clear and uber-realistic results that don't feel forced to get more volume...a brill job done.\n\nThe debut has always been my least favourite of his albums - a worthy beginning with moments of brilliance like \"It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City\", \"Growin' Up\" and the opener \"Blinded By The Light\". It also seemed to suffer from a weedy Production. At last you can 'hear' that voice and piano in \"The Angel\" and that Clarence Clemons Saxophone\/Vincent Lopez Drum shuffle for \"Spirit In The Night\" is fantastically good (Gary Tallent's Bass so sweet too). The rhythm section too in \"Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?\" is alive while the melodrama of \"Lost In The Flood\" has some hiss but more life to it than before. An impressive start to his career and a great remaster that at last does his debut some kind of justice (on our way to hubcap heaven)...\n\nAfter the earnest but awkward feel of the debut  the improvement in Springsteens 2nd album \"The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle\" (again from 1973) whomps you in the proverbial chops. Not only does it show progress and genuine brilliance in a staggering short period of time  the whole album has stood the test of time far better than the rather self-conscious \"Greetings\". I suspect true Bruciephiles adore this record and after 45 years  the Remaster comes as an absolute BLAST. I've never heard the whole album sound this beautiful  every instrument suddenly clear in the speakers  dancing around the pretty highs and lows. Never is this more vivid than on \"Wild Billy Circus Story\"  the accordion, the mandolin and the tuba  all of it is gorgeous. And I'd forgotten just how romantic the whole record is  and up. The opening minutes of \"Incident On 57th Street\" leaves me in tears  those great girly vocals that float in  Sancious playing that Steely Dan rhythm and Federici's organ playing adding layers. And by the time we get to the visceral \"Rosalita...\" the remaster is blowing all previous versions out of the water. It ends on the near ten-minute \"New York Serenade\" which sounds like Genesis on \"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\" on that stunning piano intro. You can hear squeaks in chairs and movements  all of it clear and in the now. And what a fantastic song - beautifully remastered (and I still don't know who the girl singers are)...\n\nThe last time \"Born To Run\" received a CD overhaul was the November 2005 '35th Anniversary' reissue (see review) which again Bob Ludwig transferred. So is there a difference between 2005 and 2014? Absolutely  I think it's ever so slightly better. Sure there's more hiss evident on \"She's The One\" and \"Meeting Across The River\" and that quiet piano passage on \"Jungleland\"  but all are more alive somehow and full of amazing presence. If I play the 2005 version of \"Meeting...\"  there is more compression on that hiss level  that's gone on the 2014 version so the hiss on the tape is more evident  but so is all that presence. This remaster is breathing  not trebled or supressed  just as it on the tapes. The moment the beautiful opening piano of \"Thunder Road\" hits your speakers accompanied shortly after by Bruce's lead vocals - the warmth and clarity is fabulous too. Even better is \"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\" with the brilliant and street-funky Brecker Brothers Saxophones simply flooring you (key parts were arranged by cheeky Miami Steve on a whim). When it continues with \"Night\" and \"Backstreets\" you also begin to notice more ROY BITTAN whose musical flourishes on the keyboards contributed so much to every song. Bruce now says that \"Born To Run\" the album was 'all' written on the piano and not the guitar - and that's why most songs have big intros - setting the scene - sort of mini operas. The density of \"Born To Run\" now seems opened up somehow, the sparseness of \"Meeting Across The River\" is eerie and the \"Jungleland\" 9:36 minute finisher is massively improved (\"...the hungry and the hunted explode into Rock 'n' Roll bands...\" - what a song). A superb job done...\n\n\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\" was always going to be the most difficult album in the canon to remaster well. Studio album No. 4 has always seemed to have problems with regard to muscle. 2010 saw the Deluxe Edition do it justice with some badly need 'oomph'  and here again we get another stab. Comparing both  the same applies with \"Born To Run\"  there's more presence and power but there's also more air and hiss. \"Adam Raised A Cain\" still rocks like a Punk tune but you will hear the space in \"Something In The Night\". There's huge presence in \"Factory\"  still one of the most powerful songs Bruce has ever written about the workingman and his working life. \"Prove It All Night\" kicks too but \"Racing In The Streets\" still has that distance that somehow denies you entry into the song.\n\n1980's double-album \"The River\" was the global breakthrough with \"Hungry Heart\" eating up chart placing all over the world. But of all the albums here - it's probably the one that's least stood up to musical scrutiny after all these years. Having said that the new transfer have worked wonders on some tracks but oddly seem to have done naught for others. The ballads and eerie soundscapes of \"Independence Day\", \"The River\", \"Stolen Car\", \"Drive All Night\" and \"Wreck On The Highway\" all feel better  but the rockers haven't really opened up like I'd hoped. Worse - stuff like \"Jackson Cage\", \"You Can Look...\" and \"Crush On You\" just feel dated now - while \"The Ties That Bind\" seems to have no sonic punch at all no matter what they do with it. I've always thought the brilliant B-side \"Be True\" or even the Darkness outtake \"Rendezvous\" should have replaced the terrible \"Sherry Darling\". On the upside  \"Point Blank\" and \"Fade Away\" are both stunning as is the wallop out of \"Ramrod\" and the irrepressible \"Cadillac Ranch\". And I'd forgotten how good a song \"The Price You Pay\" is. That Bass and Piano at the beginning of the stunning \"Drive All Night\" and Clarence's Sax solo always crack me up (they used it in the Stallone movie \"Copland\" to amazing effect). The double-album splurge ends on the beautiful and lonesome \"Wreck On The Highway\" (gorgeous clarity on the Bass)  a song that moved me so much back in the day...and it has done again.\n\nAfter the bombast of the double  \"Nebraska\" (recorded on a 4-Track Tascam) came as a shock - and for me was a masterstroke release. Things needed to be cooled down and that's what this stark little mother did. In fact there are times when I think it's the true gem in his catalogue  like a Johnny Cash album you need in your life. Even its cover was the very antithesis of the \"Hotel California\" excess just four years earlier  hell Springsteen's image wasn't even on the sleeve (either side). Rumour was that he'd recorded all the songs with the band but somehow it didn't work  so he just released the demos because they had that starkness he wanted. \"Nebraska\" has hiss and those vocals fuzz a little as he sings too close to the mike  but it sounds great. \"Atlantic City\" has trouble bussing in from out of state while the Dylan harmonica wail of \"Mansion On The Hill\" has yet another place on the edge of town where someone is in pain. \"Johnny 99\" is definitely the most 'demo' of all the recordings  and a live staple during his 3 and half hour marathons. Nuggets include the pure storytelling magic of \"Highway Patrolman\" (Frankie ain't no good) and the Dave Edmunds Rock 'n' Roll of \"Open All Night\"  sounding sweet. \"State Trooper\" has that whooping menace and \"Used Car\" the hurt of being poor and being sick of it.\n\n\"Born In The U.S.A.\" truly made him a global superstar and Mister America (whether he wanted the mantle or not). Remaster Engineer TOBY SCOTT recorded the original album so he knows his way around these tapes  and that becomes more than evident once the sheer muscle of the title track assaults your speakers for the first time (what an anthem). But then as you listen to \"Cover Me\", \"Darlington County\" and especially \"Working On The Highway\"  what strikes you is the deep darkness of the material allied with the fact that most of it is hidden inside poppy dance tunes  which I'm not sure everyone twigged at the time (we just wanted to party in 1984). \"Downbound Train\" has that echo vocal and all the instruments are now eerily clear and punchy  imbibing this deep little cry-in-the-dark with a spooky feel. Audio-wise the fruity \"I'm On Fire\" is amazingly in-your-face and hasn't sounded this good in years (look out girly  Bruce has a bad desire). Side 2 opens with the very River-sounding \"No Surrender\" where \"...we learned more from a three-minute record than we ever did in school...\" (I'd forgotten how good this song is). Longing for those old-days relationships\/simplicity fills \"Bobby Jean\" with heart and pathos  Bruce suddenly sounding like he's the voice of so many lost souls still looking for that one true love\/still trying to fulfil that earlier promise. \"I'm Going Down\" has the mighty Max Weinberg bashing those drums while Bruce goes 'hout' for the night. I can remember the MTV video for \"Glory Days\"  still sounds joyful and for 1984 not at all dated. \"Dancing In The Dark\" turned him into a pin-up with that video (Courteney Cox of \"Friends\" fame was the girl he pulled from the audience onto the stage). But for me the best track is \"My Hometown\"  a simple song about small town America that nails me every time...even though I'm from Dublin!\n\nThe vinyl version has that 60-page booklet in 12\" x 12\" size and is apparently a thing to behold. For those of us who can't afford expensive LPs anymore (I'd like to)  this Volume 1 on CD is a fantastic release.\n\nMore's to the point - like Bowie's next Box Set instalment of \"Five Years\" (Volume 2)  I look forward to the second outing of Bruce Springsteen's 'Album Catalogue' with a sense of excitement...and isn't that the best thing you can say about a Remaster campaign...","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Christina Aguilera's 2012 effort&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Lotus\/dp\/B009B4ZEMA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Lotus<\/a>&nbsp;follows up 2010's commercial flop&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/BIONIC-DELUXE-Explicit\/dp\/B003G4DFRC\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">BIONIC - DELUXE (Explicit)<\/a>. While Bionic was cutting edge, many fans and critics chastised the album often characterizing it as copycatting  Lady Gaga and pop trends at the time. Lotus has some modern pop cues as well that could be characterized as `trendy,' but for the most part Aguilera is less manic and `cutting edge' than she was on Bionic, which is a pro for Lotus.\n\nThe album opens with \"Lotus Intro\" (produced by Alex Da Kid and Dem Jointz), characterized by synthetic vocal effects and urban aspects. \"Lotus Intro\" foreshadows that Lotus is definitely an `experience'. \"Army of Me\" is slated in R&B-oriented pop sensibility, playing to Aguilera's prodigious vocal strengths. The chorus inspires: \"One of me is wiser\/one of me is stronger\/one of me's a fighter\/and there's a thousand faces of me\/and we're gonna rise up\/yeah we're gonna rise up\/for every time you wronged me\/well you're gonna face an army...\" Things get off on solid footing.\n\n\"Red Hot Kinda Love\" hearkens back to Bionic, but sounds distinct.  It may not show off Aguilera's voice like balladry does, but it is a brief, enjoyable record produced by Lucas Secon. Alex Da Kid, Mike Del Rio and Jayson DeZuzio to produce the neo-soul stand out \"Make The World Move.\" Cee Lo Green guests, though has no notable solos given his limited feature. Think of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Back-to-Basics\/dp\/B000G759LW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Back to Basics<\/a>'s \"Back in the Day\" as a reference point.\n\nMax Martin and Shellback work with Christina for the first time.  \"Your Body,\" the buzz single seems somewhat too similar \"Not Myself Tonight.\" It's not too shabby to be fair, but both \"Army of Me\" and \"Make The World Move\" are better. \"Let There Be Love\" falls into the clichs of pop more so than \"Your Body\" giving Aguilera an overt dance cut.\n\n\"Sing For Me\" epitomizes Aguilera's strengths; a mid-tempo ballad with solid songwriting. Aguilera slays incorporating her trademark grit and impeccable nuance. A dramatic key change towards the conclusion puts \"Sing For Me\" `over the top' in excellence.  Companion ballad \"Blank Page\" continues to show Aguilera's vocals in commanding form. The accompaniment is restricted to piano and synthetic pad,employing a stripped, quasi-unplugged feel. Aguilera emotionally connects with the audience on this cut.\n\n\"Cease Fire\" quickens the pace and adds ambitious production by Alex Da Kid.  The cut is ultimately somewhat clunky and manic, particularly following home runs in \"Sing For Me\" and \"Blank Page.\" \"Around The World\" possesses R&B sensibilities right up Aguilera's `alley.'  Dwayne \"Supa Dups\" Chin-Quee and Jason \"JG\" Gilbert deliver capable production work.\n\n\"Circles\" is a treat, finding Alex Da Kid at his best behind the boards.  Diverse compared to all other cuts, \"Circles\" blends hip-hop and rock\/pop influences. The cut definitely `turns heads.'\n\nPenultimate \"Best of Me\" has an interesting melody finding Aguilera continuing to deliver a nuanced vocal performance. Not the best of the best, \"Best of Me\" is no miss either. \"Just A Fool\" showcases sound vocal chemistry between guest Blake Shelton and Aguilera. A mix of  pop, R&B and country, the six-eight cut is a solid closer penned by Wayne Hector, Claude Kelly, and Steve Robson.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Lotus\/dp\/B009B4ZEMA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Lotus<\/a>&nbsp;overall is a solid album. It may not be Aguilera's best album or most memorable, but it is more accessible than Bionic by all means. Regardless of the divide of whether Lotus is `good,' `bad,' or `indifferent', Aguilera's brilliant voice can't be denied, particularly on cuts that showcase it best like \"Army of Me,\" \"Sing For Me,\" or \"Blank Page.\"","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"There are just very few songs today that really have tapped from the soul of the heart that really have meant something overall. For someone like Andra Day whom has struggled so much in regards to having the success the way many divas have shown like Adele and Jennifer Hudson, it has been a bit more of a struggle. So far, she has shown to be more of a one-hit wonder to start, and her debut song is one of those songs that really has worked overall. Her breakout hit song Rise Up is one of those songs that speaks soulfully softly alone from Andra, and just lets the voice from within carries nicely. This song has been one of those songs that really has simply drove into me slowly and soulfully. I love the intimacy that she makes into the song, as a real anthem for anyone that is down for the count, told not to come back and stay down on the ground forever, as someone who is worth nothing, your nothing to us, a nobody. This song is worth listening to, and I hope there are more good songs from Andra worth hearing. Hopefully, she won't be one of those souls typecasted as a one-hit wonder.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"\"Sea Waves, Vol. 1\" is so freakin' awesome! I have not been able to stop listening to this. Breakfast rolls around and I slip into a pair of shorts and my favorite Hawaiian shirt and enjoy a bowl of granola while the ocean waves wash over me. I used to be unbearable until my first cup of coffee. Now, my mood is so transformed I have even caught myself whistling! (However, after breaking several windows, I learned to stop trying to skip rocks while indoors.) After breakfast, I grab my iPod and my ear buds and take my dog for a walk on the \"beach.\" (And I live in Nebraska!) Still plenty of battery life in my iPod, so when we get back, I scatter sea shells around the stationary bike and go on a 50-mile ocean-side ride. After a quick shower, I plop down in my cabana chair, open my laptop, and spend the rest of the day writing reviews, sipping mai tai's and wondering what I did with my life before I discovered \"Sea Waves, Vol. 1.\"  I can't wait for volume II!!!

The buzz leading up to the release of single \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Live-While-We-re-Young\/dp\/B009FO90NK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Live While We're Young<\/a>\" made every teenage girl scream like a banshee, much to the chagrin of everybody else. Overall, \"Live While We're Young\" is similar in sound to hit \"What Makes You Beautiful\" while changing the theme ever so slightly.  While the band doesn't focus on chivalry this go around, they do insinuate a much more 'mature' message even if the heavy guitars only off-set their youth ever so slightly.  \"Tonight let's get some and live while we're young\" they sing enthusiastically on the anthemic pop chorus.  What are they trying to get other than... Hmm, that's a step into adulthood for sure.\n\nOverall, \"[ASIN:B009FO90NK Live While We're Young]]\" is what is expected - gargantuan hook, solos (most notably by the bassy Liam, Zayn, and Harry), and a bubblegum sound.

{"text":"Sly and the Family Stone's catalog has never been difficult to find. In addition to dozens of compilations (one of which, 1970's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Greatest-Hits\/dp\/B000GG4XI8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Greatest Hits<\/a>, was their first album to top the charts), the band's original albums have been remastered and reissued with expanded track listings. The remastered albums have themselves also been anthologized as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Collection\/dp\/B000N69PD4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Collection<\/a>. But there's more to Sylvester Stewart than the Family Stone and there's more to the Family Stone's catalog than the albums. Pulling together pre-Family obscurities, hit singles (many in their punchy mono single mixes), album cuts, live performances and previously unissued material creates an arc of musical discovery that paints a wholly (or holy) different picture than hearing the material in separate installments.\n\nThis box set opens with five sides Stewart (not yet Stone) recorded for San Francisco's Autumn label in 1964 and 1965. Stewart served as a staff producer for Autumn, helming sessions for the Beau Brummels, Mojo Men, Great Society and others (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Precious-Stone\/dp\/B0000009IW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Precious Stone<\/a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Listen-to-the-Voices\/dp\/B0037M5X1E\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Listen to the Voices<\/a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Autumn-Records-Story\/dp\/B0000074U1\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Autumn Records Story<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Dance-With-Me\/dp\/B0000004EE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dance With Me<\/a>&nbsp;for more of his production work), and his first sides riff on the hit single, \"C'mon and Swim,\" he'd written and produced for Bobby Freeman. The B-side, \"Scat Swim,\" cut a deeper groove than the plug side, and his next single, \"Buttermilk (Part 1),\" was a catchy blue-soul instrumental, with Stewart playing all the instruments, including organ and harmonica leads. The unreleased \"Dance All Night\" and his last single for Autumn, \"Temptation Walk,\" show how early (and easily) Stewart began mixing pop, soul, blues, R&B and jazz into his original stew.\n\nAfter leaving Autumn, Stewart quickly assembled what was to become Sly and the Family Stone, and waxed the 1967 demos that would land them a contract with Epic. In the wake of the group's later success, two of the tracks, the original \"I Ain't Got Nobody (For Real)\" and a cover of Otis Redding's \"I Can't Turn You Lose,\" were released on the Loadstone label. The former is powered by Larry Graham's insistent bass line and topped by the Family Stone's trademark trumpet-sax combination of Cynthia Robinson and Jerry Martini. The group began recording for Epic (at the same Golden State Recorders at which Stewart had produced for Autumn Records) in mid-1967, and the fruits of these initial sessions fill out disc one, starting with their first A-side, \"Underdog,\" and its two B-sides, \"Higher\" (from early promo singles) and \"Bad Risk.\"\n\nDespite a fresh sound that crackled with the energy of its multiple roots, neither the single nor the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/A-Whole-New-Thing\/dp\/B005F9TQ38\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">A Whole New Thing<\/a>&nbsp;made a commercial impression at the time; it wasn't until \"Dance to the Music\" was recorded in September that the Family Stone had their first hit in the can. Launched in January 1968, \"Dance to the Music\" quickly established the group's revolutionary combination of pop, rock, soul, funk and gospel, and shifted the course of pop music. Other acts quickly latched onto elements of the sound, but none could match Stewart's output as a songwriter or the band's approach as a unit. The group was sufficiently prolific as to leave fully-finished masters in the vault, including the four that end disc one. Here you'll find the band trying out previously unheard original songs, experimental vocal arrangements, and repurposed lyrics and melodies.\n\nThe July-August 1967 session tracks continue on disc two, showing the wealth of great material produced before the band finally hit with \"Dance to the Music.\" Two of session tracks (\"What Would I Do\" and \"Only One Way Out of This Mess\") were previously issued on the expanded edition of A Whole New Thing, but three more are included here for the first time: an inventive cover of the pop-folk song \"What's it Got to Do With Me,\" an early take on the autobiographical \"Future and Fame\" and the Freddie Stone-sung deep soul ballad \"I Know What You Came to Say.\" All five session tracks are as good as the material that made the original album, but the lack of early commercial success doomed this extra material to a long stay in the vault.\n\nThe band's commercial breakthrough is finally heard six tracks into disc two, with the ecstatic three-minute mono single mix of \"Dance to the Music.\" The song is, quite literally, a brilliantly catchy tutorial on the sound being created before the listener's very ears. As memorable as are the mono singles, stereo album sides like \"Ride the Rhythm\" more expansively show off the band's inventive arrangements and tight musicianship as they explode across the soundstage. Disc two finishes out with album tracks from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Dance-to-the-Music\/dp\/B00136RZLM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dance to the Music<\/a>, the previously unreleased \"We Love All,\" the obscure mostly-instrumental French-language single \"Danse a la Musique\" (and it's even stranger Chipmunk-voiced B-side, \"Small Fries\"), the unreleased B-side \"Chicken,\" and exuberant sides from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Life\/dp\/B005F9TQ2E\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Life<\/a>, including mono single masters for \"Life\" (with a different lead vocal track than the album cut) and \"M'Lady.\"\n\nDisc three opens with the band's second smash single, the #1 \"Everyday People\" and its charting flipside, \"Sing a Simple Song.\" These tracks, along with \"Stand!\" (offered here in a live recording) and \"I Want to Take You Higher,\" powered the commercial success of the band's third album. As with their debut, the band recorded a lot more material during the album sessions than they could issue, and disc three includes another helping of previously unreleased bonuses, including unused instrumental backings. The group became a hot live act, essayed here with performances from the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, and scored in 1969 as singles artists with \"Hot Fun in the Summertime,\" \"Everybody is a Star\" and \"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),\" all heard here as mono singles.\n\nThe final disc open with the band's next album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/There-s-a-Riot-Goin-On\/dp\/B0013384JW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">There's a Riot Goin' On<\/a>, including album tracks and all three of its singles. Ironically, though the album yielded the hit \"Family Affair,\" it was recorded in large part by Stone alone, with overdubs by Family members and other hired-hands (including keyboard player Billy Preston). The album hasn't the organic sound or joyous mood of the band's earlier material, and the sonics of 1971 overdubbing and the use of a drum machine on several tracks subdues the group's underlying funk. By 1973 the group's membership was beginning to change, including new drummers, a replacement for the departed Larry Graham, and the addition of a third horn player. The group's singles (including \"If You Want Me to Stay\" and \"Time for Livin'\") continued to chart in the Top 40, as did their final two albums Fresh and Small Talk.\n\nBy 1975 Sly had disbanded the Family Stone and begun to record as a solo artist backed by hired musicians. His album High on You, expands beyond the musical boundaries of the Family Stone, adding steel guitar and other touches that hadn't been heard on the band's releases. Disc four closes out with selections from Stone's solo work, from the then-newly formulated Family Stone's Heard Ya Missed Me, Well I'm Back, and a pair of previously unreleased tracks, \"Hoboken\" and \"High.\" The box set lingers a bit more over the first-half of the group's career, rushing through the latter half in a single disc, but that's in balance with the band's rise to fame, the peaking of their invention, and the view most listeners will have of their career.\n\nThis is a well thought out anthology, touching on Stewart's pre-Family solo work, the Family's rise to fame, their chart domination and fire as a live act, their eventual end and Sly Stone's return to solo work. Along the way there are iconic hit singles, B-sides and album tracks, seventeen previously unreleased tracks and a large helping of original mono single mixes. The only real omission from this set are the studio versions of \"Stand\" and \"I Want to Take You Higher!,\" each of which are included among the live tracks. The mono mixes will be greatly appreciated by fans who have already completed their collection of the expanded stereo album reissues. For those without any of the group's catalog on-hand, your surround sound-trained ears may find the stereo hits more immediately satisfying; check out the album reissues, or the anthologies Greatest Hits or Essential.\n\nIn addition to the mono mixes and unreleased tracks, the set's 104-page book is its own star. The book includes finely written liner notes, an informative timeline, rare photographs, reproductions of labels, sleeves and posters, and revelatory track-by-track comments from the Greg Errico, Larry Graham,  Jerry Martini, Cynthia Robinson, Sly Stone and many others. In addition to the standard 4-CD set, there are several variations: an Amazon exclusive CD box that adds a fifth disc (and parallel MP3 downloads), a vinyl LP edition (with its own Amazon exclusive variation) and a single disc highlights.

{"text":"When I picked up Brandon Heath's third project, I was expecting something hard hitting about the realities of life.  What else would you expect from a disc entitled Leaving Eden?  While Brandon does touch on that some, he spends most of the time focusing on God, His love for us, and how we can make a difference in the world around us.\n\nThe disc opens with \"Leaving Eden,\" and it is the one song on the disc that does talk about how hard life can be.  Over the course of the verses, he mentioned Alzheimer's, a Salvation Army store being robbed, natural disaster, and war.  Yeah, real upbeat stuff.  So it is actually a surprise that the song is on the fast side of mid-tempo with a soaring melody that makes it much less depressing then you think it would be.\n\nBut Brandon immediately changes focus with the second track.  \"Your Love\" is the first single from the disc, and it's a winner.  It's at once a song of praise and surrender to God for His great love for us.  Again, it's on the mid-tempo side of things with a melody that is very catchy.  This one will be very popular on the radio.\n\nActually, God's love and care for us are the theme of several of the other songs on this disc.  \"It's Alright\" is a piano and string based ballad that uses images from Jesus' life to remind us He always have things under control.  \"Stolen,\" one of my favorites on this disc, talks about God's relentless pursuit of those He calls His own.  And for pure fun, there's \"Might Just Save Your Life.\"  This song is written from God's point of view as He rescues someone who was in a desperate situation.  This song is pure rock with a tad of hip hop thrown in.  Frankly, it reminds me most of \"Give Me Your Eyes\" from his last CD.\n\nThe other theme on the disc is how we are to respond to the world around us as a result of knowing God's love.  The theme is introduced early in \"The Light in Me,\" but it really starts to be driven home at the end of the disc.  \"It's No Good to be Alone\" is written to a friend who has withdrawn from life.  Verse one sounds like someone hiding due to depression while verse two is someone so busy perusing a dream they lose track of everyone around them.  The chorus is a tad on the repetitive side as it repeats the title several times, but the fun melody always makes me forget that fact.  In fact, this is the song I am most likely to find myself humming after I listen to the disc.\n\n\"The One\" goes beyond our friends to look at those struggling around us.  But it doesn't end with the verses detailing the hardships around us.  The chorus is a call to action.  \"If it takes just one, just one\/What if, what if, what if I'm the one.\"\n\nThe final track looks forward to the hope of Heaven.  \"As Long as I'm Here\" is a slow ballad that dreams of how great the day will be when we can return to Eden.  While he doesn't quite put it that bluntly, it certainly does bring the disc full circle.\n\nStylistically, Brandon is still in the mostly guitar driven pop\/rock he's done so well on his first two discs.  There isn't too much new to his sound, but his fans will certainly be happy with what they hear.\n\nLeaving Eden might not be a huge step forward musically for Brandon Heath, but the songs here are still great.  His many fans will be pleased with it and it might just win him some new ones as well.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"What a surprise this album was! To Be Honest, I've always had a love\/hate relationship with Barbra, finding her albums often going from superb to abysmal, depending on choice of numbers, producers, etc. Don't get me wrong, I love the lady, & her voice, one in ten million, & truly a joy to listen to. It's just that sometimes, I wish she'd do something out of character. Sure, she can do swing, she can do love songs, she can do Broadway, etc., etc., ad infinitum. When she's good, she's GREAT, but when she's not good, she can be DREADFUL; and as I said, I've found this to be due to the choice of songs, the album producer, or the lack of variety offered on the album. But for some reason, when she partners up with other artists, the result is often extraordinary. And that's the case with Partners. It is beautiful to listen to, has a great range of songs (although a couple of up tempo numbers would have lifted it further), boasts a superb & varied cast of accompanying singers, and is superbly produced & orchestrated. Her voice has never sounded so in tune with the choice of songs, so powerful (yet so mellow), so hypnotic. For me, only 'New York State Of Mind\" seems out of place here, it just doesn't seem to reach the heights of all the other songs on offer. Blake Shelton proves he is not only a country\/pop crossover artist, while Michael Buble & Stevie Wonder are at their best. For me however, the standout track is 'Love Me Tender', with Barbra and a very youthful sounding Elvis Presley, bringing to the listener, a completely new, yet at the same time, lovingly rendered & reverent interpretation of one of the greatest love songs of all time. Absolutely fabulous! Please Barbra, let there be a Partners Volume 2 in the not too distant future.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Ill admit - Ive liked Josh Groban since I first heard him on his debut album.  However, after a few mainstream pop albums, its great to hear him back in a genre that best suits his voice!\n\nAmong the (goosebump-inducing) highlights are Bring Him Home, If I Loved You (a beautiful duet with Audra McDonald, whose voice best complements his) and Gold Can Turn to Sand (from Kristina).  Groban is in better voice than Ive heard him in a long time, and he emotes beautifully in these classic gems.\n\nThe only really weak track was All I Ask of You with Kelly Clarkson.  While Clarkson did a respectable job on her part, the piece was almost too big for her voice, and she was (understandably) drowned out by Groban on the high notes, but that still doesnt detract from the overall beauty of the album.\n\nWhile I would highly recommend this album, I would hold out for the Target exclusive, which includes two bonus tracks not on this album (If I Cant Love Her from Beauty and the Beast and Dulcinea from Man of La Mancha).  Unfortunately, you would then miss out on the free mp3 download offered through Amazon.  But I guess if you're a real Grobanite it might be worth having both versions!  Either way, I guarantee you will enjoy the album!","classification":5,"fold":8}

I really think this one follows the way No One helped make As I Am shine. This track works better than anything from wannabe artists like Fantasia or Jordan Sparks. I definitely know Alicia really will make her next single just as good as this one.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"When you're a metal maverick at 54 with nobody to share new music with, finding and listening to new bands is an adventure to say the least.  My friends at and near my age for the most part are totally disconnected to any rock music after the mid to late '80's, and consider Nirvana to be \"new\" and not good, either.  Fools.  Granted, there is a lot of terrible music out there, but when has that not been the case?  Music historians love to reminisce about the great '60's and '70's, but the decades that gave us the Beach Boys, Beatles, the first Led Zeppelin album ('60's) and Pink Floyd, more Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, the glory days of the Who, etc. ('70's) also gave us some of the most banal idiotic pop music ever, lest we forget abominations like B.J. Thomas, the Carpenters, John Denver and a host of other performers I'd just as soon forget.  Of course your taste is your business, but my point is made.\n  So when we dismiss \"new\" stuff past 1991, we overlook some terrible stuff, like Limp Bizkit and most nu-metal, rap and hip hop, and the usual terrible Top 40 crap.  It's just harder to find the stuff you like because with the internet and a huge recording industry, the choices are much greater, and most decent bands spawn hundreds of clones.  So I delve into new music through reviews mainly, and the occasional new tune on satellite radio, and I've been open minded enough to embrace some really great stuff.  Clutch, Muse, High on Fire, Wire, Mastodon, Immortal, and others make exciting music that is worthy of any rock lover's attention.  The newest band to cross my radar is Baroness, whom I knew about but like usual shoved them to the back of the pile until finally giving them a chance with the \"Yellow and Green\" album.  I was floored.\n  Now I have \"Purple\", and it is brilliant.  After the near fatal bus crash in 2012 that severely injured leader John Baizley and turned his left upper arm into goulash, 11 broken pieces of his humerus and 20 to 30 pieces of hardware and severe nerve damage left behind to deal with, and with a lot of pain, we're lucky the band was able to return at all, albeit with a new drummer and bassist.  For the horror of the crash, it's really astounding to hear the positive vibe of \"Purple\", an album that rocks a little harder than \"Yellow and Green\", but still has the signature atmosphere, heartfelt lyrics and hooks enough to outfit a fishing fleet.  It's worthy of the immense praise it's already received,  and shows that at least some current bands still know what makes an album great.\n  You get a hint or two of fellow Georgians Mastodon if that equally great band was a bit less proggy and the thick guitars that don't waste a single  note.  Baizley is brilliant, and deserves to have this album be a huge seller.  There's no excuse anybody who claims to love rock and roll not to check out Baroness.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Five CLASSIC Stars? No, easily a SIX! A one word Review? SPECTACULAR! An Essential Recording for any serious jazz collection. The big difference here is intensity and Tony Williams. The addition of the teenage drumming genius Tony Williams was a brilliant acquistion by Miles and it revitalized the quintet with his youthful freshness and orchestral cunning. And Davis formed one of the greatest rhythm sections in jazz history, along with the amazing pianism of Herbie Hancock on piano and the redoubtable Ron Carter on bass. Future \"NEA Jazz Master\" George Coleman, who synthesized Coltrane and Rollins into a personal style, was also a great 'get' for the quintet (beating out Frank Strozier, I'm told). And they play like dervishes on this CD, finally released at a sensible price for such a classic recording.\n\nAll performances are the \"Pieces D'Resistance\" of this disc. \"Autumn Leaves\" is FANTASTIC, both individually and collectively. Mile's muted solo is so fresh, relaxed, and inventive. Coleman's solo, composed of packets of notes, packs a powerful punch leading to a crescendo, opening the door for Hancock's relentlessly brilliant, rhythmically varied solo with some great block chording. Note the fascinating musical conversation between Hancock and Williams at the beginning of the piano solo, before it surges back into 4\/4. Carter's arco bass solo is equally brilliant. But Williams is operating on a level of jazz drumming on a par with the greatest drum masters, driving and inspiring the musicians to new heights during their solos. WOW!! I've listened to this song for decades and it still amazes me. But this was just the beginning...enter \"Milestones\".\n\nWe've heard \"Milestones\" a million times but Miles has concocted a new version for this occasion. It begins at a breathtaking pace, with a unison head that is not the usual toss-away head that Miles was sometimes fond of. \"Get it over with and let's get to the solos.\" Not this time. The quintet is on top of 'all things unison'. Mile's fiery solo is one of his best up-tempo solos ever, Coleman's ribbon of sound solo is fascinating, leading to Hancock's truly spectacular solo. All pushed along by the brilliant rhythm trio, especially future DownBeat Hall of Fame member Williams. A fabulous performance.\n\n\"Joshua\" is in a similar vein as \"Milestones\", but Miles had a plan. \"Joshua\" is distinct and invigorating with choppy rhythmic breaks delineated by Williams' rim shots. Note how Miles stops in mid-solo, almost as a challenge (\"What cha' gonna' do now, guys?\"), and Carter and Hancock rush to fill in the pause before Miles surges back to finish an AWESOME solo. And Hancock's solo is 'too much'. After you listen to it, go back and key in on Tony Williams' performance, he is formidable!!\n\n I could go on describing each excellent individual track. Later, Miles was so impressed that he made coast to coast telephone calls to Ralph Gleason to play and rave about certain parts of the recording, especially what Tony Williams was doing on the drums. For one known to be so self-critical, Miles was blown away by this quintet's live performance! So am I and I have been listening to this recording for decades! This is a CLASSIC recording, jazz fans,  A Real Keeper. Six SIZZLING Stars !!!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"If you've read Crosby's second installment of his autobiography, you know that he and Nash get off a couple of very pointed barbs aimed at Stills. Presumably, they were good natured. With his very first remarks on this set, Stills slaps the puck back into their net and scores magnificently, and then gets on with the business at hand, beginning with Tree Top Flyer and roaring right on through seamlessly to the closer, Love The One....\nStills looks healthier, and by his own admission, feels so. His voice is coming back, much as Levon Helm's has, and that's just amazingly great news. While there is no new material here, the renditions, now from a 63 year old campaigner and defender of democracy, a cancer survivor, and a man who has lived his life with eyes open and his mind on, all sound brand spanking new and infused with an insight that comes from the road thus travelled. It ain't the years, it's the mileage, and Stills delivers a triumphant survey of his work. He has found different registers in which to cast his voice and the songs he has written. For my money, I think his take on Suite: Judy Blue Eyes and Rock and Roll Woman eclipse the CSN and Buffalo Springfield versions. The loss in both songs is more palpable, the tragedy accepted with a wisdom that knows one's life runs against time. His sense of humour is spot on throughout and there is even a sense of self deprecation, first evident in his tumble during the Deja Vu film and now in his wry asides about his own youthful perceptions found in Four and Twenty.\nThere is a clarity of tone to his guitar playing that I haven't heard in ages and his command of his instrument and the Latin and American blues that are the bedrock of his influences ring with an authenticity that has been enhanced by age, by life. There isn't a lick throughout that is there as showmanship. Every harmonic, every chord and key sequence, every pluck and plectrum strike rings with authority. He takes on Dylan's \"Girl From The North Country\" and makes it his own - absolutely an astounding delivery. And the man looks like he's having fun.\nStills has questioned whether he still has it, whether the Muse is still speaking to him, or if he can, through his tinnitus, still hear her. Based solely on this performance, I'd encourage him to keep at it. He has very clearly prepared himself in such a way that the Music is as much playing him as he the music. In short, in the words of another English guitarist, he has prepared himself so that Music can lean over and take him into its confidence. To that end, I would hope he will continue to sing, play, compose. He has something worthwhile to say, and I very mcuh want to listen to him.  For all his afflictions from a life such as his, he is a man alive with his muse and that's cause for celebration. Isn't it about time?","classification":5,"fold":8}
{"text":"I loved the previous Father John Misty album, \"Fear Fun\", and was initially disappointed with this new batch of songs. They didn't seem to have that same captivating quality to them. At least not initially. But after a few dozen listens, I'm won over once again. Great album!\n\nThe songs may not have as many hooks as the ones on \"Fear Fun\" but the playful lyrics more than make over any ever-so-slight slack in the melodies. I haven't heard a singer-songwriter display such wit, wisdom, sarcasm, and sauciness since the glory days of Randy Newman. Honesty, Father John Misty, aka Josh Tillman, deserves to be recognized as one of the best songwriters around nowadays. His lyrical brilliance and melodic tunes are an addictive combination.\n\nThis new album was produced by rising star Jonathan Wilson, who also sings and plays on many of the songs. The CD comes with a fold-out poster that has all the lyrics to the songs. The poster design is a bit cumbersome --- I would have preferred a \"normal\" booklet --- but at least you get something extra for your money. Speaking of which, there actually is a small booklet of sorts this is included with the CD, dubbed \"Exercises for Listening.\" These \"exercises\", it turns out, are very funny tips from Mr. Tillman on how the listener can better appreciate certain songs on the album. For \"I Went to the Store One Day,\" for example, he suggests:\n\nGo to a store you darkly shuffle through for cigarettes and glass bottles of water everyday\nLay down in one of the aisles\nWait for someone to pick you up\n\nI'm not sure I'm willing to try that one, but for a musical \"pick up\" this CD is a winner from start to finish!","classification":5,"fold":8}

Tomorrow We Live continues Reach Record's latest trend of bringing us polished, mainstream-style rap music.\n\nI liked Fall In Love With You (he can sing better than I would expect), I Believe, and Ima Just Do It. SIdeways was another good track but I didn't dig the hook as much as I wished, and the song was carried by the feature from Lecrae.

In some ways she's on par with Emmylou Harris for the most identifiable vocal talents.\n\nYes, the disk is more piano based than guitar, which is slightly different for her, but she's a talented mult-instrumentalist.\n\nIf you're looking for a mainstream disk, this isn't it - even for DeMent.

{"text":"With \"Elysium,\" the Pet Shop Boys take a lighter approach to the grooves. This is a very tranquil album, comparable to \"Release\" from 2002. Maturity has crept into the oeuvre, letting the tempos slow down for the most part while the introspective lyrics take their precious time working their way into your consciousness. Songs like \"Invisible\" or \"Requiem In Denim And Leopardskin\" carefully dissect the duo's often ironic worldview.\n\nThe Boys don't completely stay in midtempo land. The short but biting \"Your Early Stuff\" is reminiscent of \"Yesterday When I Was Mad,\" about a chance meeting with a casual fan who asks ridiculous questions and asks about the management that rips you off when you're a pop star. There's the danceable \"A Face Like That\" and the funny \"Ego Music\" where Neil Tennant declares \"I am my own demographic\" over a dance beat. There's also the Olympic anthem, \"Winning,\" which is triumphant without being histrionic.\n\nThe lighter touch to most of the songs is something of a hindrance to the album overall, as \"Elysium\" takes several listens to take hold. Like the underrated \"Bilingual\" and again, \"Release,\" the album seems like a holding pattern. Fans will be pleased, but casual listeners may find it too bland to take.","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"I found this a fascinating album for me of all people to review, I have studied Native American Shamanism and I also play the Native American Drum, at the moment we have three drums in the house and I have spent many years in the mid west of Oklahoma, so at last I get a drum based album to review.\nGet Tribal are new to me and their album God Of Drum has as somewhat powerful title, but after listening to track one, I was sold, with a constant purposeful rhythm the composition Wakinyan or Call Of Abundance is a constant guiding start that makes this album a little special. The main totem for Abundance is the mighty Buffalo, it teaches us that at all times we will always have just what we need to get through, and we have abundance. Musically this piece works superbly and was my favourite off the album; I also like the voice synthesiser segments as well, which added a certain dimensional element to the track.\nEach track from this album also related according to the material I had been given, to a specific Chakra within the energetic field or light body, so while track one signified the root or Base Chakra we can now move to the Sacral, a somewhat unusual Celtic inspired track that used various forms of indigenous percussion and even bagpipes! The piece is entitled Loucetious or Passion Rising Once more here the rhythm is the key, but also the resonance and the energy of the track as well and Get Tribal have created a collective of world instrumentation and sounds and brought to the world something very unique indeed.\nWe move with the swiftness of a Dragon to the third track entitled quite aptly Lei Shan or Sea Of Qi. Again setting the scene nicely, Get Tribal take us east on a journey of the inner self and we make a brief detour in our light body to the Dantien (The centre of our energetic life force) using once more indigenous drums and percussion, we are treated to a piece that has a light sense about it, but also has a deep resonance within as well, a well constructed composition that was not over complicated.\nFrom the gentle refrains of the East to the sheer power of track four known as Donnar or Awakening Power a very tribal orientated composition that represents the Solar Plexus Chakra. This track gives the listener a David Arkenstone moment of pure Lord of the Rings, using the Gregorian chant was a nice touch that added a time and a deeper feel and distinction to the composition.\nAt the half way stage we move back to the Emerald Isle for our Heart Chakra piece called Taranis or A Call to Heal I must admit that I have never had healing with Celtic music, but I am willing to give anything a go. This is a curious composition that uses Lute, Fiddles and various percussive instruments that will take us further on our healing journey and toward the very centre of our heart. A very cleverly played track that just before 3 minutes has a superb low sounding drum, that I wished had stayed for longer, or been used even more.\nDear constant reader we are on a journey through the elements that make up God of Drum by Get Tribal and now our journey through that realm takes us to a very tribal sounding composition called Flow of Expression this African themed song contains assorted Caribbean percussion, with Marimba and some Kari Hone vocalisation that I have not heard since Flaming Star from Sally Oldfield. A track that represents the throat Chakra does have a very fluent energy about it and is a very smooth and relaxing piece to play.\nWe move to the composition Open to Wonder, representative of the Brow Chakra. This has a wonderfully Middle Eastern feel to it and Adad, Babylon will have a real appeal across the musical board. Having seen a Turkish Oud in my time there, it was pleasing to see this being used on this very ethnic track and the heavier rock style drums gave us a real deep piece to delve to get into another favourite of mine this one.\nWe move swiftly onto Teshub Anatolia or Transcending Boundaries which for me, still had that element of Gregorian style within it, whilst being mixed with a Middle Eastern percussion and a Sitar, this is a real fusion mix of a composition and will be much liked across the world fusion beat community, the digitised vocal an added bonus here.\nThe next one was a new one to me, Chaac, Maya or Aligning with Purpose and representative of what is known as the 8th Chakra, or Soul Star Chakra, apparently located above the Crown chakra. This was also probably the most unique track off the album with South American drums and percussion, which gave us a perspective of not only Mayan energy, but also through the music an insight to our higher purpose.\nWhich dear constant readers take us to the end of our journey through God of Drum, by Get Tribal and we finish with an Indian based composition called Endless Reflection. This was a very calm and peaceful way to end the album, once more Get Tribal have brought a mixture of indigenous instrumentation to the musical table and succeeded with a delicate composition that was in fact the longest off the album and that in a way would be a slight criticism that I have of the project. I wished that some if not all of the tracks had been longer, especially the opening piece, Abundance.\nWith that being said God of Drum is certainly unique, its certainly fresh and its most defiantly very different from any Chakra based album that you will have ever heard before in the New Age genre. If you like albums with a good drum beat you will love this, if you like a world fusion theme, you will adore this album and if you like to find the occasional little gem of an album, in a world filled with wall to wall bubble gum music then God of Drum by Get Tribal will certainly lift you out of that malaise and bring your ears a treat of musical distinctiveness.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"It's devastating that Amy Winehouse died all too prematurely; wow, when she was at the top of her game very few could ever touch her! Back To Black by Amy Winehouse features her talents as a professional singer, songwriter and guitar player. She even provides her own background vocals on some of these tracks! I'm impressed. Amy certainly has her personal demons; but she does an incredible job performing the songs on this CD. The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is beautifully done. The liner notes include the song lyrics as well as the credits. In addition, the \"clean\" version of this CD may have a few words clumsily omitted; but for those of us who don't want their small children to hear certain words this version of Amy's album is the way to go.\n\nThe album begins with Amy singing her heart out on \"Rehab.\" She sings of a woman, probably based in part on her own experiences, who is not exactly eager to go to a rehabilitation center as a way to get better. The musical arrangement has a strong percussion element that supplies the foundation for the music; the guitar and brass work well for \"Rehab\" to create a lush musical arrangement. Nevertheless, this arrangement never steals the spotlight away from Amy's vocals; and \"Rehab\" is a powerful, catchy and memorable number. \"You Know I'm No Good\" starts off with what sounds like a rap or hip hop musical intro; but when the music goes into the main portion of the song you get that `60s style arrangement Amy does so well. Amy sings this without a superfluous note and she never falters. \"You Know I'm No Good\" explores complicated, painful love relationships and Amy delivers this like a champ! In addition, I really like \"Just Friends;\" Amy sings this wearing her heart on her sleeve. Her excellent diction enhances her performance even more and again the music fits in perfectly with her singing.\n\n\"Back To Black,\" the title track for this album, reminds me of a tune The Supremes might have released in their time. Amy delivers this without a hitch. \"Back To Black\" deals with the pain that can come with the ending of a love affair; and \"Back To Black\" is obviously a major highlight of this album. \"Love Is a Losing Game\" is another tune that explores the painful end of a love affair. \"Love Is a Losing Game\" also has a somewhat mellow, old school vibe arrangement to accompany Amy as she sings this to perfection and beyond! \"Tears Dry on Their Own\" is a stunner, too. \"Wake Up Alone\" has complex key modulations but Amy handles this like the pro she is and always will be! \"Wake Up Alone\" stuns me with its beauty even though it's not the happiest of songs; Amy Winehouse does a great job on \"Wake Up Alone.\"\n\n\"Some Unholy War\" has Amy singing, playing guitar and providing her own backup vocals. \"Some Unholy War\" has Amy squarely in the spotlight--right where she belongs! Although the track set appears to end with \"He Can Only Hold Her,\" the CD has silence for about 20 seconds before we are treated to a remix of \"You Know I'm No Good.\" Excellent!\n\nBack To Black still sells well years after its release; this proves just how wonderful the music is on this album. This CD is a \"must-have\" for Amy's fans who want the \"clean\" version of this album. In addition, people who enjoy songs with a retro soul flavor to them will not be disappointed.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"With Lorrie Morgan's recent departure from RCA subsidiary BNA, this new seventeen-track set captures the final original recordings of a mostly successful eleven-year tenure.  It also serves as a fairly effective sequel  to Morgan's eleven-track Greatest Hits collection from 1995.  There are two  overlaps: her signature recording - the symphonic saga \"Something In Red\" -  and the pedestrian non-hit ballad \"Standing Tall.\"  The latter tune should  have been dumped in favor of the pretty, top 5 charter \"Out Of Your Shoes\"  (the only significant Morgan recording not found on either anthology).\n  In the five years since her first collection, the honey-voiced Morgan's  track record at radio has become increasingly spotty.  Not surprising,  about half of the hits included here are recordings made before 1995 that  didn't make it onto the first set.  These include her hard-shufflin'  breakthrough single \"Trainwreck Of Emotion\" (choo-choo!), the toe-tapping  #1 \"We Both Walk,\" and the stirring confession \"He Talks To Me.\"  They tend  to make more of an impact than the recent rousers \"Go Away\" or \"One Of  Those Nights Tonight\" and especially, her snoozy duets with ex-hubby Jon  Randall (\"By My Side\") and Sammy Kershaw (\"Maybe Not Tonight\").\n  The five new recordings show a great diversity in both musical styles and  taste.  Morgan's stunning take on the Tammy Wynette classic \"Another Lonely  Song\" is a tribute in every sense of the word and probably her greatest  vocal performance to date.  Meanwhile, the rap-infested \"Whoop-de-do\" is  definitely her worst (Morgan has never sounded so inane).  The remaining  new efforts are a pair of pale \"Something In Red\" imitations (\"To Get To  You,\" \"If I Cry\") and a live recording of the precious Sarah McLachlan hit  \"Angel.\"  Those last three torchy recordings seem to signal the direction  Morgan wants to take her career in the future... what a shame.","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"As Leonard Cohen has aged, his voice has descended to a breathy whisper that is still recognizable as the shadow of the voice of the earlier albums.  He always was a bit of a minimalist (forget the flirtation with Phil Spector!), and here things are even more stripped down.  The instruments are soft and back in the aural mix, and Leonard's whispered lyrics are echoed by the voice of the singer\/songwriter Sharon Robinson (who should perhaps have been credited with equal billing here) in a way that creates a kind of aural halo behind Cohen's voice.  In his mid-60's when this album was produced, Cohen is now meditating -- talking to himself, almost -- on the difficulties of sustaining love and truth (including truth about oneself) and on the old romantic theme of the imagination's power to mock us by presenting us with ideal visions of ourselves that we can't attain.  So, if one had to sum it up, \"necessary failures\" would be the sober theme of this album, and the mature acceptance of failure and loss would characterize its mood.  There are some strong songs here -- In My Secret Life\" and \"A Thousand Kisses Deep\" are about the way the imagination can both console us for and tease us with our limitations.  Even better is \"That Don't Make It Junk\" -- an assertion of the value of a flawed life, and the albums nearest thing to a witty song.  The discomforts of the consciousness that one's life has external comforts is the theme of \"The Land of Plenty.\"  There is one indubitably great song on the album -- \"Alexandra Leaving,\" a reworking of a poem by Cafavy and, in Cohen's version, focused on the need not to deceive oneself about what one is losing, but also a celebration of what is lost and its value.  That's what the lines about honor are getting at and that's why self-deception is denounced as a \"strategy\" that one shouldn't stoop to.  It is as beautiful and moving a song as Cohen ever wrote.  If you don't want to buy the whole album (quite inexpensive by now) download that one to your mp3.","classification":5,"fold":8}

That's really what music should be about, but it's not always what sells best. I really hope this album does the business because it deserves to.\n\nThe songs are mostly about relationships, but there always appear to be many different situations that songwriters can use and Deana has found what are, at the very least, new twists on old themes. Sometimes the problem is the man in her life (You can't stay, a song in which she wants him to go so that she can be free to start again with another man), sometimes she observes another woman's problem (I know better) and sometimes the problem is hers (I'll save my love for you, in which she seems to want a man she can't have -  at least not for a while). The whole album is rounded off nicely by the title track.\n\nDeana is not the most prolific recording artist, but she always delivers quality.

Sure, it might be a little too familiar for rock radio in its short burst of the 1st round, but it saves all its energy for the rest of the song, when it brings the house down with its catchy and infectious energy that sounds right out of the 90's.\n\nOverall, with its loaded gun of energy, and familiar, but still rockin' elements driving it, if you listen to rock radio, you're going to love it.

{"text":"Of all the bands that I have grown up with since I was a child, The Bangles is one of the few that has stayed with me into my adult years. I recently have bought a ticket for their upcoming fall tour so in preparation I picked up a copy of the band's last studio album (when Michael Steele was still in the band) Doll Revolution (the band's first album since Everything). I used to have the cd years ago but had to sell it for some much needed cash. I am so glad I bought it again. I almost forgot how much I loved the album. I definitely can hear the maturity in the band's songwriting. Like in the '80s, the women all harmonize perfectly together as well as take turns singing lead. I enjoyed all the songs. The bonus dvd is a nice treat for fans of the band. Overall I felt like I got my money's worth. I am so looking forward to seeing the band later this fall.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"When I listened to this \"Son of Believe\", I was impressed with the offering, and decided it was really the better looking brother of \"Believe\". \"Believe\" was a hard act to follow, but need i say?, Living Proof is just that!\n ON Believe Cher seemed to be more passive to the producers. Her involvement on this cd is very evident. She is there for multiple background choruses, and works all the vocals superbly. It's great to hear a girl singer with a lower register, and a way with a lyric. The work is there and the power of the singer is up front. I personally find a few of the tracks her highest achieving artistially ever! \"When the Money's Gone\" is a wonderful rocking dance rock track that finds Cher earnestly questioning the fidelity of her partner when the riches fall! It is a terrific track. \"This is a song(for the lonely\" is an anthem dedicated to the Sept . 11th victims and families, and she shouts it in plaintive cry, in the feel of a real rocker. It is full of emotion and conviction.\"Rain Rain\", has a hook that stays after one listen, and the depth that makes you glad you remembered it!\nCher's cover of Amber's hit, \"Love One Another\" does not become a brides-maid to Amber. She brings a low decible sincerity that only a mature woman can pull off. \"A different Kind of Love \"Song, is just that! AND....Cher universally dedicates it to everyone, acknowledging love in a universal way! Cher is no stranger to fame, and this cd will only add to her roster!!! I love it, and so will you. Cher sounds strangely youthful in 2001-2, and guess what..It's inspiring.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Mumford & Sons 2012 effort&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Babel\/dp\/B008NW67E0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Babel<\/a>&nbsp;is easily one of the year's most anticipated efforts. A solid album overall, first time Mumford & Sons fan may enjoy Babel `better' than the most invested fans; more invested fans may pinpoint Babel as `formulaic' and `safe' rather than innovative.  Arguments presented, Babel is sure-fire commercial hit that may not necessarily `progress' the band's artistry to `the next level' as expected. A superb group of musicians, as good as Babel is, it may be ever so slightly humbler than the hype.\n\nOpener \"Babel\" is characterized by Mumford & Sons's `rhythmic machine' (acoustic guitar, banjo) and set in six-eight time.  Ben Lovett's piano provides a chordal foundation, preempting  contrast from Marcus Mumford's gritty vocals in favor of smoother, more melodic-centered vocals.  \"Babel\" is ultimately well conceived; it ends with cliffhanging airy pad segueing into \"Whispers in the Dark.\"\n\n\"Whispers in the Dark\" possesses constant rhythmic motion throughout the verses, though it is softer allowing for Marcus's vocals to shine without strain.  `Wall of sound' vocals aid in giving the record an inviting timbre, committed to folk. \"Whispers\" is less emotionally dynamic than \"Babel\" however.\n\n\"I Will Wait\" receives valedictory honors easily.  Highlights include supporting vocal harmonizations as well as sound vocal production overall.  Songwriting is superb by all means.  Add excellent pacing with an eventual fruition of production including piercing horns and \"I Will Wait\" seems a shoe-in for Grammy nominations (Record and\/or Song of the Year).\n\n\"Holland Road\" keeps Mumford & Sons on `autopilot.' The harmonic scheme is similar to \"I Will Wait,\" while the pace is slower, a stark contrast.  Mumford's vocals are emotional and sincere.  Add a splash of brass and \"Holland Road\" is easily on the same plane as \"Babel\" or \"I Will Wait.\"\n\n\"Ghost That We Knew\" comes off shy of the level of the aforementioned \"Babel,\" \"I Will Wait\" or \"Holland Road,\" but delivers sound songwriting, most notably on the chorus: \"So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light\/Cause oh that gave me such  a fright...\" There is not too much to trivialize, save for  some `predictability' (the unwinding ending) and length at nearly six minutes.\n\n\"Lover of the Light,\" takes a subtle approach prior to Mumford `letting it rip.'  The melody highlights and is clearly discernible.  \"Lover of the Light\" benefits its chorus, much like \"Ghost...\" did: \"But love the one you hold\/and I'll be your goal\/to have and to hold\/A lover of the light.\" The instrumental timbres within the production add to a list of positives.  Even so, the cut is a bit lengthy.\n\"Lovers' Eyes\" delivers a well-paced, well thought out cut. Vocal production is clear and Mumford's lead vocals sincere as he references religion, forgiveness, and love: \"Cuz I feel numb beneath your tongue\/your strength just makes me feel less strong\/do not ask the price I pay for I must live with my quiet rage...\" Mumford's overt outro seals the deal: \"But I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow\/take my hand, help me on my way...\" As Al Green would put it, \"Simply Beautiful.\"\n\n\"Reminder\" gives the listener a simple, brief cut at 2:04.  Not among the `elite,' it is a solid and lovely showing.  \"Hopeless Wanderer,\" lacks little `unpredictability' here, which hurts its cause.  With the `deck of cards' revealed, this is a solid track where one desires a bit more `shake up' within the formula.\n\n\"Broken Crown\" is the best  of the quartet then closes Babel. Horns tighten up sound even if it follows a similar formula.  \"Broken Crown\" lifts some \"Little Lion Man\" swag by dropping the f-bomb within the chorus if nothing else. \"Below My Feet\" delivers nothing new per say while closing cut \"Not With Haste\" is solid, though average compared against juggernaut \"I Will Wait.\" The Deluxe edition tacks on three bonus cuts (\"For Those Below,\" \"The Boxer\" featuring Jerry Douglas and Paul Simon, and \"Where Are You Now\"), bringing the total number of songs to fifteen.\n\nOverall,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Babel\/dp\/B008NW67E0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Babel<\/a>&nbsp;is a solid, enjoyable album. It could potentially land multiple Grammy nominations (just made the submission deadline), even as lofty as the coveted `Album of the Year.' That said,  Babel is not necessarily `THE best album' I've personally reviewed this year, but contains the sensibilities and `cadences' of what the Recording Academy likes for sure. The biggest quibbles personally are that the band can\/should take more risks instead of clinging to safety and `formulaic' means.  The perceptible predictability could be easily eradicated with minor changes and `tricks.' Babel gets it done, but album no. 3 needs to `take the next step'; 3  Stars.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"After hearing the song \"Heard It All Before\" on the radio for atleast 5 to 10 times, I didn't know that Sunshine Anderson was the singer until I saw the advertisement for her CD on BET.  I liked the song a lot and I knew I would pick this CD up on it's release date.  After listening to this CD, it sounds like Sunshine is a seasoned artist and I know that people that like r&b music will enjoy her debut CD.  The CD starts off with the uptempo songs but gradually gives you the midtempo and slow songs as well.  The majority of the production is handled by Mike City and all the music is produced by Beat Brokas' Ent.  After you listen to \"Your Woman\" 2 or 3 times, you will be reminded of Mary J. Blige's \"What's The 411\" and Faith Evans' \"Faith\", in my opinion.  That is not a problem though, because Sunshine does have a distinctive sound throughout the CD.  Just as India Arie's \"Acoustic Soul\" demonstrates, it's nice to hear some down to earth, positive r&b music.  My favorites so far include \"Where Have You Been\", \"Lunch Or Dinner\", \"Last Night\" w\/Anthony Hamilton & Dolo Pichino, \"Being Away\" & \"Crazy Love\".  Although all of her songs make the grade, I will give a slight advantage to the slow and midtempo songs on this CD.  Overall, Sunshine Anderson has a nice debut on her hands and should have a brilliant future as a singer.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"When it has honestly came down to Rihanna, she has honestly been one of the most overexposed artists of the past several years, that has really been more annoying in her voice than brilliant. Sadly, it has been the reason why her songs have not been good. So rather than takinga  break, she chose to make more music, and become more annoying in her songs. Her latest single, Diamonds from her album Unapologetic feels like she has been a bit tired and worn in her voice. She tries too hard to hit the right notes, and sadly her voice suffers from the lyrics. The lyrics are better than most of Rihanna's poorly made songs. I think Rihanna has made some bad choice in her voice, and that needs to be arranged better with her next song.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"An eclectic assortment that effectively distills the Apple catalog down to one bite-sized collection. The obvious highlights are the two Badfinger hits, the Paul McCartney-written \"Come and Get It\" and the George Harrison-produced \"Day After Day.\" There are so many Beatle-related tracks here, fans of the group wiould do well to acquire it.\n\nBut lesser known gems abound, including Jackie Lomax's \"Sour Milk Sea\". The song was written by George Harrison and features quite a line-up: Harrison on rhythm guitar, Eric Clapton on lead, McCartney on bass, Ringo on drums. The only weak link is Lomax, who's voice isn't much to write home about.  Otherwise its a great rocking track. James Taylor's debut album was released by Apple, represented here by \"Carolina In My Mind\".\n\nMary Hopkin's smash hit \"Those Were the Days\" leads off the set. Her follow-up hit \"Goodbye\" is out of this world. The song was written and produced by McCartney, and it is simply one of his unheralded classics. \"That's the Way God Planned It\" is performed by another supergroup: Preston on keys, Harrison on guitar, Clapton on lead, Keith Richards on bass, Ginger Baker on drums. Preston is also represented by his version of Harrison's \"My Sweet Lord,\" produced by George (and preceding his own version).\n\nOddities pepper the CD...\"King Of Fuh\" by Brute Force is an amusing novelty number. \"Thingumybob\" was written by McCartney for the old-timey brass band Black Dyke Mills Band.  Trash's version of \"Golden Slumbers\/Carry That Weight\" comes off like a poor man's Beatlemania (the soundalike group of the late '70s). Hot Chocolate Band's rewrite of \"Give Peace a Chance\" is actually pretty interesting - their newly worded stream-of-consciousness verses arguably carry more weight than Lennon's original nonsense.\n\nWith so much direct participation from all four Beatles, especially Harrison (who was involved in some way with nearly half the tracks), it's a great value for Beatles fans.","classification":4,"fold":8}

Admittedly, I cannot wrap my brains around a number of your posts. I am unable to figure out what is going on. Years ago some of our teens at St. Mary's had a dance where a teen went to the deejay and asked him not to play a questionable song. His response was this was the \"clean version.\" This wonderful teen objected, \"That does not matter because there is still a dirty version and we want no part of it.\" I was so proud of her. We do not want to lend support, moral or monetary, to those who vulgarize our society and attack the Church. We also should do all we can not to render scandal. I suspect there is some meaning or higher value that you are trying to communicate. But maybe I am too old fashioned and closed-minded to see it? Like I said, I cannot figure this out.

Rita Ora's voice is fun, sexy and powerful.  She has some solid hits so far and will be a talent to be reckoned with for quite some time.  Her contribution to \"Black Widow\" is solid.  Unfortunately, she is pair with Iggy Azalea due to music industry's current obsession with forcing audiences to believe Iggy is actually talented.\n\n  \"Black Widow's\" success on the charts (going as high as #3 on Billboard) is due to Ora's presence.  This is the case with all the other high charting songs that Iggy has road coattails on (\"Problem\", powered by Ariana Grande, and \"Fancy\", powered by Charli XCX).

The lyrics are so beautiful as well as meaningful that they can bring tears to your eyes, if you are in the right frame of mind. The music too matches the lyrics, in that, it too is beautiful. It far outstrips Candle in the Wind, for beauty. It is a song about giving God Thanks, for certain people in his life, that have changed the person's life for the better, no matter what happened to the contrary. It is truly a work of art. Elton was definitely inspired when he wrote this. It will be forever on the top of my all time favorite songs of all time list. I would suggest that you buy it. At least, give a good listen. Maybe a second and a third, until you can hear all the words clearly. He sings things like \"I know why roses don't grow in New York\" and other things like that you probably aren't expecting. Just buy the song and let it enrich your life. The words alone could be a poem to people we love; who make a difference in our lives. A complete and utter dedication to them - those loved ones.

{"text":"I have been a big fan of the \"99\" series of the Stockholm-based X5 Music Group. They have been turning out quality sets of classical music for remarkable prices here on Amazon for some time. Especially their composer-themed sets featuring full-length works have been tremendous bargains, although other themes such as \"Relaxing\", \"Allegros\", \"Darkest\", etc have also been worthwhile.\n\nThat's why I was surprised to see that this new \"99 Must-Have\" set of classics for $1.99 on Amazon is released by the Los Angeles-based Cobra Entertainment. It looks like someone has decided to give X5 some competition using this tried and true model.\n\nThese are not performances by the best-known stars of classical music -- although there are some pretty good players such as Hungarian pianist Jeno Jando or the Budapest Festival Orchestra under Ivan Fischer, who was until recently principal conductor for many years at the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington. I think it's fair to say that a lot of these recordings are by respected Eastern European orchestras and performers -- a model that often works both economically and artistically.\n\nThe benefit for the consumer of having a new supplier in town is that these are generally a different universe of recordings than on the X5 sets, which as buyers of the series know can be repetitive. I haven't gone over every single track, but I looked at many and so far I'm not finding any tracks that feature the same music by the same performers as any of the X5 collections I have purchased.\n\nThis is clearly a \"best of classical\" type collection, so a lot of this is music you will have heard before, including on the X5 sets, but a lot of it is different and there is a good proportion of short but full-length works (important for me as I don't particularly care for excerpts). And while there are a lot of \"greatest hits\", there is also quite a bit of music that is off the beaten path. I can't say I was too familiar with Jean Baptiste Loeillet or Zdenek Fibich, or had much Henri Wieniawski in my collection.\n\nI must say Cobra has done a better job of staying \"on topic\" than X5 has sometimes. You can't always depend on all the tracks of a \"99 Most Relaxing\" set to really be relaxing, for example, and there are plenty of tracks on the \"99 Most Romantic\" collection that would surely kill any hopes for an amorous trist. But this one really does all seem to contain 100% chill out music. Very soothing. I'm thinking of it for my new baby's nursery at bedtime. Or maybe even for myself at bedtime.\n\nMy biggest criticism is a lack of attention to detail on things like opus or catalog numbers so the listener can tell what is really playing. One example -- there is a pretty nice string orchestra reworking of a Chopin Nocturne, identified only as \"Nocturne in E flat major\" (track 35). Some digging reveals that it's Nocturne No. 2 in E-flat Major, Op. 9. But it would have been nice not to have to dig. A glance at the track listing shows this kind of labeling is the rule rather than the exception.\n\nBut this is a good deal with good music. Yes, a lot of it is sliced and diced and pre-processed, but it's good and lives up to the promise of the title.\n\nThe track listing, as always on Amazon, doesn't show you the composers.

The song compares the hustle and bustle and dog-eat-dog Los Angeles world too nice, suburban San Jose.  San Jose is now a dog- eat-dog tech center that separates the white collar professionals from the working class on a greater scale than anything that ever was in the 1960s.

{"text":"I happened upon The Fratellis late to the game!  But, \"better late than never!\"  They're very talented & innovative, changing-it-up song by song (not only from one release to another) keeping your interest piqued!  I did go in reverse, getting \"In Your Own Sweet Time\" first (reviewed separately) & do like that one better, but I do like EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED!\n\nTrack #1 \"Me and the Devil\" and Track #3 \"Baby Don't You Lie to Me!\" have a similar sound & they're both highlights.  Track #6 \"Dogtown\" is a little weird.  It begins sounding a bit like a faster Beatles' \"Come Together\", but then goes into what reminds me of 'circus music' & both repeat through song.  That 'circus' music I find more than a little odd & for me the song would have been one of my favorites on EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED without it - But, again, name of the game for The Fratellis seems to be experimentation & with that, some will work exremely well & some not at all.  And, they have many more in the \"works extremely well\" category!!  Track #2 \"Imposters\" (Little by Little) doesn't work for me, although it does showcase their variety, once more.  Guitar's much too \"twangy\" a.k.a. country-western for me.  Track #8 is a really pleasant, beautiful ballad & jumped into a favorite immediately, which is a complete surprise for me, since I don't usually care much for ballads & by 2018, that's a particularly nice revelation! On Track #9 \"Getting Surreal\" The Fratelli's pump it up a notch!\n\nI didn't go with the deluxe version, because even on my most favorite recordings, I don't appreciate acoustic so much.  I imagine EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED is a must-have for Fratellis fans & I think it's an excellent jumping-in point for newcomers, as there's something enjoyable for everyone.  I would liken The Fratellis, especially on EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED to a 21st Century Dire Straits, as they were uber-successful completely disregarding (1980's) trends & doing their own exceptionally talented thing.  The Fratellis don't sound like Dire Straits...the similarity lies in bucking trendy music, having a vast, devoted following & being hugely popular & successful!","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"As the title, Keepsakes in the Attic, implies, pianist\/composer Jeff Bjorck has created an album filled with nostalgia and treasured memories, both real and imagined. I greatly enjoyed the concept for this album and along with the track notes he has provided for each song, I found myself imagining many of the scenarios he described. And while Jeffs music is instrumental, it is quite visually evocative and conveys imaginative stories in musical notes, rather than words. This album is Jeffs sixth release, following a string of well-received and critically acclaimed albums.\n\nThe appropriately named opening track, Afternoon Reverie, captures the nostalgic mood one might feel while searching through family heirlooms and the bittersweet memories of loved ones long gone. There is a wistful yet warm ambiance to Jeffs solo piano melody that provides a perfect introduction to the album. This feeling continues into the next track, Returning Home, which as Jeff says: was inspired by the times I found myself driving from far away back to my hometown and to the house where I grew up. There is a sense of forward motion in the melody that captures the feel of driving, as well as a sense of anticipation in getting closer to home. While nostalgia is often tinged with wistfulness, here it takes on a more upbeat feeling. The album concludes with a lovely little piece called Nanas Music Box, that recalls the love in a grandmothers eyes as her grandchildren lift the lid on her antique music box to delight in its enchanting song. According to Jeff, I chose to end this melody by figuratively leaving the lid open so the echoes and memories can continue on in the listeners heart.\n\nIn todays world where there is so much fascination with the latest thing or what is on the cutting edge, I found Jeffs appreciation for the past to be refreshing. Keepsakes in the Attic is a warm-hearted musical journey that I greatly enjoyed taking. I particularly appreciated the wide range of emotions portrayed within its beautiful melodies. Jeff Bjorck is a talented and expressive pianist with a particular gift for sharing evocative stories in song.\n\nTo read a full length feature article on this album, as well as others, please visit: MichaelDiamondMusic.com","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I recently saw Father John Misty, the stage moniker of ex-Fleet Foxes' Josh Tillman, in concert (more on that later). Father John Misty seemingly came out of nowhere with his debut album \"Fear Fun\" a few years back. It got some attention, but that was nothing as compared to when this album came out earlier this year.\n\n\"I Love You, Honeybear\" (11 tracks; 45 min.) opens with the title track, an epic-sounding track that immediately sounds more confident than anything from \"Fear Fun\", and it merely sets the table for what is to follow. Father John Misty is the alter-ego so to speak of Joshua Tillman, so when he brings a song called \"The Night Josh Tillman Came To Our Apt.\", I honestly don't know how to take that. Is it Tillman using the guise of Father John Misty to comment on his life? That aside, it's another beautiful tune. \"Strange Encounter\" is one of the tracks that reminds me of Blitzen Trapper. Other highlights on here for me include the strangely titled \"Nothing Good Ever Happens at the Goddamn Thirsty Crow\" and the album's closer \"I Went To the Store One Day\". A fine album indeed.\n\nI recently saw Father John Misty at the rapidly-growing Bunbury Music Festival here in Cincinnati, where Tillman and his 4 piece back-up band played a mid-afternoon set on the main stage, playing almost exclusively from the new album (I think \"Fear Fun\" got one or two songs). The massive crowd was very appreciative of his 60 min. set. If you have a chance to see this guy live, do not miss him, he will absolutely delight you.  Meanwhile, \"I Love You, Honeybear\" is highly recommended!","classification":4,"fold":8}
{"text":"As someone who is a die hard fan of Two Steps from Hell and E.S. Posthumous. I was skeptical that I would have any interest in Audiomachine's foray into epic, orchestral scores.\n\nBut then someone added a few tracks from Audiomachine's album to a youtube playlist and I found myself looping the same songs over again. War of Faith, Sura, Being Alive, just to name a few. I wanted to know more of who the artist was that composed these songs and lo and behold it was from Audiomachine's Magnus album which is absolutely stupendous.\n\nTake for instance War of Faith. The song starts with a slow, almost imperceptible build where you're wondering if you set the audio levels correctly on your device. Then you hear the pianos, the strings, a flourish of cymbals, and all of sudden you're hit with powerful vocals. I was left closing my eyes, bobbing my head, listening to this track over and over until I had to force myself to move onto another song.\n\nSo when I saw that there were 23 tracks left in the playlist, I couldn't help but grin. Magnus is an excellent compilation of orchestral scores and should be a MUST HAVE to any fans of epic, instrumental music.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Yeah, I figured that everyone & their brother would be singing the praises of this one.  Here's my 2 cents worth: 3rd album from these Montreal, Canada stalwarts of the indie rock scene is composed of big,\n  modern, inquisitive pop\/rock songs with a near-epic quality, driven by multi-tracked instruments\n  spread over poignant & catchy melodies with perceptive lyrics that explore the fallacy of the\n  suburban dream experience.  Organically prodigious, anthemic tunes laid on a conceptual string\n  that vibrates with the tenacity of driving expansionism.  These songs range from easy flowing pop\n  structures to aggressive, complex & sophisticated rock--all sealed with a kiss of sincerity.  It feels\n  like it could be a grower.

As for the rest of the tunes - there's \"English Rose\", the awesome \"Time is Right\" (would love to hear this song played live sometime) and specially the closer - that deals with war and faith - \"The Thousand Names Of God\", shows us all just how truly inspiring as well as intelligent lyrics Motorhead is able to come up with.

She really puts so much emotion and authenticity in the song that you can easily picture yourself saying this at the same time that the song is playing. She has really good vocals to go with this very classic song.  This definitely sounds like \"beautiful music\" with the way she raises her sensual voice at the end.

But what can be said is his guitar playing is as stellar as always, and is indeed the brightest light on this album.","classification":3,"fold":8}

The slick production and catchy tune guarantee that you will be humming \"Fireflies\" to yourself for the rest of the day after you hear it. The fresh, original lyrics make it stand out from the plethora of whinging love songs you hear on public radio. I could relate to it, because, like Young, I'm an insomniac. He shows that you don't have to be disappointed in love to have trouble sleeping. And you can use those sleepless nights for inspiration, as Young does.

{"text":"In April 1964 veteran R&B impresarios George Goldner, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller teamed up with the multi-talented producer\/songwriting team of Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich and launched Red Bird Records in New York City. This was a match made in heaven. Over the next several years the Red Bird label would release some of the most exciting pop records ever recorded. And while it wasn't really planned that way nearly 90% of the labels successful releases were by female groups or solo artists. One of the most interesting and innovative tunes to be released by Red Bird was The Dixie Cups classic recording of the Mardi Gras favorite \"Iko Iko\". The song, under the original title \"Jock-A-Mo\", was written and released as a single in 1953 by Sugar Boy and his Cane Cutters but failed to make the charts. There are as many guesses about the meaning of this song as there are versions of it. So why not forget about all that and just enjoy the original hit recording of this fabulous tune?","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Van Morrison\n\"...It's Too Late to Stop Now...Volumes II, III, IV\"  (CD & DVD)\n(Sony Music, 2016)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThough I do dearly love Van Morrison's first band, Them, as well his early solo pop stuff from the \"Brown Eyed Girl\" era, it's his languid, richly mystical jazz-folk poetry-improvs of the early '70s that really sets the benchmark for his genius and eternal appeal.  This four-disc CD\/DVD combo comes from that time, capturing four shows from 1973 where Morrison and his Caledonia Soul Orchestra delve deep into roots music soul.  This is a strong, confident band, taking huge leaps into experimental, genre-busting new terrain, with bold, exploratory solos and a commitment to improvisation and immediacy that leads to radically different interpretations of well-known classic material.  Longtime fans who have flocked to his shows or tracked down old bootlegs may not be surprised by these recordings, but they will delight in their newfound availability, particularly in such high-quality, beautifully remastered versions.  The real treasure here is the DVD video, with extensive footage of Morrison performing at his creative peak during a July 24 show at the Rainbow ballroom in London -- in short: wow.  Newcomers and devoted fans alike will find a lot to celebrate here. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Music Reviews)","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Russian-born migr and Bronx, New York resident Regina Spektor has been one of the most eclectic talents on the music scene since her 2002 debut album SONGS.  Of course, these days, the term \"eclectic\" seems to be anathema to most corporate radio programmers; and this proved to be the case for WHAT WE SAW FROM THE CHEAP SEATS, which once again displays Regina's penchant for combinations of rock, cabaret pop, and minimalist jazz, combined with a solid piano technique and a fairly wide vocal range.  It just couldn't get the kind of attention it deserved from radio.\n\nJust the same, WHATH WE SAW FROM THE CHEAP SEATS sold well enough (and rightfully so) and ranked among a lot of people's Top 10 favorites for the year 2012, and that includes me.  Regina's about as far removed as it is possible to be from Taylor Swift (in her pop phase), or even Norah Jones (who has since worn out her welcome, at least with me).  Even comparisons to Lilith Fair-era artists like Tori Amos or Sarah McLachlan won't suffice, not after hearing just the first two tracks, \"Small Town Moon\" and \"Oh Marcello\" (with its literal lyrical borrowing from the Animals' 1965 classic \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\"), and, later on, \"All The Rowboats\" and the very pointed \"Ballad Of A Politician.\"  Not only is a lot of Regina's music on this album eclectic; one almost has to classify a lot of it as being deliberately funny and satirical, even, dare it be said, kitschy.\n\nBut then that's all the more reason for fans of unorthodox pop music to get CHEAP SEATS, and all of her previous albums along with it, and leave the corporate radio stuff behind.  CHEAP SEATS is a winner.","classification":5,"fold":8}

Well, I thought there were two really good songs here: \"AYTA\" and \"Life\". The rest just kind of hangs there, though \"Tradition\" was a bit of an unusual song for Ed Roland. The problem with this new album is that, like 2000's \"Blender\" its just too much production. Let the songs breathe, man. \"Hurricane\" is buried in excessive noise. \"Am I Getting Through\" same problem. Then there's the bland ballads like \"Confession\" and \"Without Me\". First single \"This\" is fairly decent along with \"Exposed\" and \"Contagious\".\n\nI don't know. This album, like several others of theirs, is just fine. It's not a high water mark, but it's not bad. However, being gone for six years I'd hoped for more. I don't get all the five star reviews here. Is this classic rock? Nope.

{"text":"Review no. 2,314. Still cannot believe that I got this 20th Anniversary 2-CD expanded edition piece at the price that I did. You get the original CD with Nirvana gems - like their break-through it \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", the rocking \"Come As You Are\" \"Breed\" my personal favorite \"Territory Pissings\" and one I hadn't heard in sometime now \"Lounge Act\". In addition, there are nine bonus cuts to fill out disc one - with three B-sides - including several live at Paramuont Theatre and two live at Del Mar - including one that I don't remember at all - the very happening \"Been A Son\". Disc two is nearly as fantastic with eight (8) songs from the Smart Studio Sessions including their Velvet Underground cover \"Here She Comes Now\" + eight tracks from the Boombox Rehearsals and two songs from the BBC. Most definitely - highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I do indeed (like it)- but I think it should be supplemented with a more modern recording of the D major (5th) string quintet; listen to the finale in this version (just the first two seconds...), and the finale in e.g. the Orion Quartet\/Ida Kavafian version of this quintet available for free from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum online (gardnermuseum-dot-org), starting from about 21:03 to about 21:06 (or so!...) in their recording-- the difference is not subtle. (It's the difference between using the possibly corrupt first printed edition and the NMA urtext, to summarize very briefly; the reasoning behind the choices made by the NMA editors is publicly available at the Digital Mozart Edition website :) . Unfortunately when it comes to older and newer recordings and performances that of otherwise very good quality, one does want to combine the best features of each... Anyhow, a fine collection, that can be supplemented too by what are often good and free newer performances available online; with repertoire like this, both rather than one or the other and much better than neither, I think...)","classification":4,"fold":8}

The new stuff didn't do much for me then, and listening to the studio versions now is only a mildly pleasant experience.  Erika's voice is as strong as ever, and the musicianship is very solid (lively guitar work throughout).  It's just that the songwriting is, well, kinda boring. (I never thought I'd say that about the Heartless Bastards!)  Maybe it's that the material is generally more downtempo than usual for Erika.  (Listen to \"Pocket Full of Thirst\" for an example of this whole situation.)  Restless Ones isn't a bad album, it's only that she\/they have been so much better in the past.","classification":3,"fold":8}

There has been a lot of things that she went through musically, including a nasty lawsuit with her ex-label Sony, and her professional life as a actress has blossomed with the sequel to Why Did I Get Married last year which did well at the box office. But musically, her songs haven't shown lately that they have the spark they once brought out from her era with Sony. Her latest song, So In Love with Anthony Hamilton, from her upcoming record The Light Of The Sun is alright, but honestly the song is very short. I also wish that there could've been a bit more with the chemistry between Anthony & Jill. I still hope there is better than what has came out from Jill already. It is honestly very sad when someone whom has had a great voice, but loses their feeling in songs to showcase it. I just hope there is better from Jill when her album comes around next month.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"This album is a reissue of the original UK album, which was apparently very different from its American counterpart. The first seven songs were in the soundtrack of the movie while the last seven songs were not.\n\nUnlike some Beatles albums, this one actually includes some hit singles. They are Help, Ticket to ride and Yesterday, although their version of Yesterday was not released as a single in the UK until the mid-seventies, when it made the top ten. Many covers of Yesterday were released as singles in the UK but only two charted, these being the versions by Matt Monro, who made the top ten, and Marianne Faithfull, who made the top forty. Of course, all the singles that were released in Britain and America at the time were number one hits.\n\nThe early Beatles albums included several covers but times were changing so this album contains only two. One of them, Act naturally, is a country song originally performed by Buck Owens. On this version, Ringo is the lead singer. The other cover, Dizzy Miss Lizzy, is a rock'n'roll song originally performed by Larry Williams.\n\nApart from the three hits already mentioned, the most popular songs here are You've got to hide your love away and I've just seen a face, both of which have been covered by a number of other singers and groups in a variety of musical styles. The remaining songs, including two by George Harrison, are interesting but not especially memorable. For that reason, this album is not one of the strongest Beatles albums, but it is still an excellent album in its own way and worthy of its five stars.\n\nSo, this is a great album but less great than most other Beatles albums. If you only want some Beatles music but not everything, you can give this a miss as long as you have a compilation containing the hits. If, like me, you want a lot of their music, this album becomes essential.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"One day about 11 years ago, I was watching Yo! MTV Raps; after the show ended, they showed this video which looked like a bunch of teenagers jumping around in a gymnasium, and three off color gentlemen playing in a band. I, much like many who were also watching at the time, were naive that we were watching history in the making.\nHair metal was on it's way out in the early 90's; though Guns N'Roses \"Appetite For Destruction\" pointed hair metal in the direction of the door, Nirvana's Nevermind put the boot in their asses. This record is harsh and abrasive in some areas,and very smooth in others. While most people know them from Smells Like Teen Spirit, that is HARDLY the best song on the album; listen to Come As You Are(my favorite), In Bloom, Lithium, Drain You and Lounge Act, then listen to the radio; this record has been copied, abused and plagarized by many, MANY, less talented bands(Creed, Nickleback, The Calling, Puddle Of Mudd,etc...). Nirvana is one band that can truly say that one member is not more valuable than the others; the crisp, fast thrash metal inspired drumming of Dave Grohl and the robust and slightly muddy bass of Krist Noveselic(I'm partial to bass players since I am one)round out the piercing vocals and riffs of Kurt Cobain, though Kurt wasn't the most technical of guitarists. Most people call this the best grunge album of all time; that's not true since this isn't even Nirvana's best album(that honor belongs to In Utero, which IS the best grunge album of all time; sorry Pearl Jam and Alice In Chains fans), but its the most important album of the 90's hands down.","classification":5,"fold":8}

The last track is a quick one-minute bit of New Orleans street music; pure brass band jamming.

{"text":"I have all of Jesse Cook's music, and I have seen him in concert at least six times.  That said, this album is a different cup of tea than he usually produces.  First, there is quite a bit of singing on the CD by a female singer; most of his music is just instrumental, and he is very good at background sounds that go along with his guitar work.  This album also has that element, his use of violin or string instruments accompanies and enriches his guitar solos immensely.  However, that being said, this is NOT an upbeat, happy album; it seems more intrinsic, sad, almost depressing at times.  It is the type of music you might want to have for background like when you are studying, reading, or doing something where you want to fill the space with introspective sound.  The third song is, for example, not all gloom and doom, but even so, it is still somewhat somber and not light.  My wife was disappointed in this CD at first; after listening to it several times, she tolerates it now.  I, kind of like it, and it is growing on me.  Still, if you are not in a good mood, I wouldn't recommend this as a way to improve your mood. It might just make you more depressed or negative.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"When the buzz on Amy Winehouse began here in the United States, I became very intrigued. Not only by the music aspect, but her personality and little tabloid troubles back home. I heard \"You Know I'm No Good\" and \"Rehab\" and I instantly knew I was going to buy Back To Black as soon as it hit stores domestically. (Plus, I am an absolute sucker for these UK imports like M.I.A., Lily Allen, Joss Stone and now Amy.)\n\nAfter listening, all I can say is 'wow!' It truly is that good. I love her vocals, which remind me a lot of Lauryn Hill. (And the last minute or two of \"Just Friends\" remind me a lot of Hill's \"Ex Factor.\") The production flawlessly replicates the old school soul and adds a few modern touches. The lyrics are true-to-life, blunt, raw and quite emotional. I loved every song, except for the unnecessary remix of \"You Know...\" with Ghostface Killah. How can so much quality be packed into 10 songs and a little more than 30 minutes of music? The world may never know. I highly recommend buying this album.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"This review is for the single \"Me And Bobby McGee\" as sung by Janis Joplin, lyrics and by Kris Kristofferson and Fred Foster.\n\nKristofferson and Joplin had a close personal relationship and, while the song was not written explicitly for her, the tune fits Ms. Joplin's style very well.\n\nHer voice is neither smooth nor melodic - it reminds me very much of Billie Holliday's voice.  And, like Lady Day, with Ms. Joplin it isn't about the tonality she brings to her work; it's the (to coin a too-oft used word) soul she expends when singing.\n\nMany singers can bring feeling into a ballad; very few can make the listener want to weep in sympathy with the singer's obvious pain and loneliness.  Sinatra, most certainly; he spent over 60 years with his main theme being loneliness (or the brief intermission of a new love before loneliness returned).  Billie Holliday; her life was filled with pain both physical and emotional and she brought every ounce of it into her work.  And Janis Joplin, whose body of work is small in the number of recordings but huge in the personality she embedded in the canon.\n\n\"Me And Bobby McGee\" (recorded a few days before Ms. Joplin's death in 1970) is a fine example of her music.  While the writing may not be necessarily on a par with, for instance, Cole Porter's work one must consider the different genre that Messrs. Kristofferson and Foster worked in.\n\nI highly recommend this recording - with the caveat that I have a personal emotional tie in to the record.  I was freshly back in the United States (just a few months) from the Vietnam war when Ms. Joplin passed away leaving this last piece with which to be remembered and her passing hit me with nearly the force of a physical blow. I had listened to her songs when I was with the U.S. Army and her loss at the age of 27 was hard to deal with - even though I had never met her in person.\n\nOthers who do not have direct experience of the 1960's may not bring the memories that those of us who lived through it to songs of that era - but I think that this particular song of Ms. Joplin's has stood the test of time and stands on it's own merit.\n\nHTH\n\nRegards,\n\nJim","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"This is the long awaited follow up to \"life is killing me\", and it was well worth it.  This is on their new lable SPV, who did a masterful packageing deal with their lyrics being layed out in a cross fold out booklet.  Enough about the exterior, this album dredges up sounds reminiscnet of Slow Deep and Hard and Bloody Kisses Smashed together and angrier than ever. The album has 10 tracks and clocks in at a dredging 77 minutes of Highs and Lows.  Personal favorite tracks are \"Tripping A Blind Man\", \"Some Stupid Tomorrow\", and the best track for me \"Ode To Locksmiths\"  a fast and swinging ditty that even dredges memories of Carnivore.  There are two tracks that move in at 10 plus minutes (Profit of Doom, and These Three Things).  These tracks have about 3-4 tempo changes each and would make for great live tracks.  Halloween in Heaven, Dead Again, and Some Stupid Tomorrow will likely be good candidates for singles to push radio play of the group, being the shorter tracks on the album.  Finally, the track September Sun is a close second for my favorite track, a slow burner that is ballad like in only a haunting type o negative way.  The album is mixed brilliantly, just a great venture for these guys.  Buy this album, good intro to the band, and a must for fans.\n\nFYI: for those of you curious about the 5 live tracks available at a large retail store, The CD clocks in at around 44 minutes, and has the tracks Everything Dies\/ My Girlfriends Girlfriend, Are you Afraid\/Gravitational Constant, Christian Women, Love you to Death, and Black Number One.

{"text":"Blacc Hollywood by Wiz Khalifa is his third studio album since his mainstream breakthrough. His last album ONIFC was a complete sleeper lacking the appeal of a big single, too many songs, and lazy and even sometimes boring production values. Wiz tries to right those wrongs by going back to what he did with his debut studio album, Rolling Papers, by adding more pop appeal and going for bigger songs. Unfortunately, it comes out with mixed results.\nLet's get one thing straight. Wiz Khalifa is not an extremely talented rapper, his sluggish flow works for a very few number of beats, and his lyrics are extremely limited to weed, money, sex and more weed. This album does nothing to change that for Wiz. Like previous albums, he makes an attempt to change the formula by doing some crooning like on the big single \"Staying Out All Night\" with a big pop hook. It doesn't work out very well for him though. In fact, \"Staying Out All Night\" was the only real successful single here. The hook is catchy, and the verses work out well enough, though the lyrics are just as painful as ever.\nHe takes a whack at some other big songs like the lead single \"We Dem Boyz\" which is nothing short of absolutely painful. The beat is incredibly lazy, the hook might be the most unimaginative hook we've seen in a big song in recent memory, and the rapping is so far out of Wiz's league it's sad. Unfortunately they even decided to do a remix with Nas and Schoolboy Q, and they can't do anything to save it. We get close to successful singles with songs like \"So High\" and \"Promises\". But they both fall flat as well. \"Promises\" doesn't even get close to Khalifa's style, as it seems like it would have been a better fit with a Ty Dolla $ign mixtape. \"So High\" fails in the production category as well as the lyrics aspect of it. It's a boring R&B attempt, that has some absolutely pathetic rapping on Wiz's end.\nThe only songs here that even really get close to the \"Staying Out All Night\" standard are the songs \"A** Drop\" and \"True Colors\". \"A** Drop\" adds some much needed variety production wise, it doesn't really fit with the rest of the album but it's entertaining enough as is. \"True Colors\" might have a NIcki Minaj feature, but it's able to stay entertaining long enough with a pop friendly beat and a solid hook.\nBlacc Hollywood is just not a good album. There isn't enough variety to keep it interesting for very long, the big songs are overshadowed by poor production and Wiz's lazy flow. Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this one.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 4\/10\n\nGreat:\nStaying Out All Night\nA** Drop\nTrue Colors\n\nGood:\nKK\nRaw\nYou And Your Friends\n\nOkay:\nPromises\nHouse In The Hills\nHope\n\nMeh:\nStill Down\nSo High\n\nBad:\nWe Dem Boyz\nWe Dem Boyz (Remix)\nNo Gain\nThe Sleaze","classification":2,"fold":8}

I promise that you are not hearing these sounds from anyone else right now. There are a lot of attempts right now to create an older sound- like Anjani- a SONY artist who is trying to recreate the songs that made Marilyn Monroe famous that are half-baked attempts that lack true soul.\n\nI will say Amy Winehouse is not a pretty person to watch sing, she's a pretty girl, but she just looks funny when she sings...haha....But the kid has soul, and a deep jazzy voice that take you someplace.\n\nIf you like jazz, blues, or soul then you may like this.

I bought the vinyl album back then and played it frequently using high end turntables connected to an audiophile grade system. Years later, I switched to high end CD players and improved analog system technology. I briefly owned the virtual Red Book CD. It sounded just as good as the vinyl, actually cleaner and with improved dynamic range. The MP3 sound quality of this version is amazingly good for this type of format.

{"text":"There is no question that today's music feels much more like it has really been wasted from the heart, and lost its potency. For acts like Jason Derulo, he has had a hard time musically as well as personally, with the end of his engagement to Jordin Sparks and trying to find his footing again in song. His latest song really feels like a departure from his sound and his heart on Trumpets, the second single from his Talk Dirty album. The song isn't actually a strong and upbeat song, instead the song actually feels like it is honestly corny. He really just didn't ignite from the heart, and the rhythm didn't catch afire either. At least it is better than the joke songs from Katy Perry and Beyonce' Knowles. Still, I hope he does find better with the music he comes out with on his next album, something that will make the trumpets blow in joyous symphonies.\n\nSong: C 1\/2-","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"I just have to say this -- I have no idea why this song is titled \"Iris.\"  The name doesn't crop up anywhere in the lyrics, and while I don't believe that a song's title has to be part of the lyrics (see Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" or Green Day's \"Good Riddance\"), it can be confusing to people trying to search for the song online.  The song did first appear on the soundtrack of the film \"City of Angels,\" which I haven't seen, so perhaps the title has something to do with the movie?  *shrug*\n\nAt any rate, despite the possible confusion over the name, this is a lovely song, a love ballad with powerful guitar music and melancholy but warm and inviting vocals.  It's probably not the greatest love song of the '90s, but it's certainly one of the most memorable, and continues to resonate with listeners long after the film it debuted in has largely faded from memory.  Perfect for fans of the '90s or for love-song enthusiasts.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Lets be quite honest here. Marvels musical track record is quite horrendous. There are a few bright spots in the past films where composers where able to shine through these corporate-created money-makers. Unfortunately when the producers are calling shots over the directors that leaves the composers in the dust. And whatever great moments they were able to establish would never be allowed to continue. So all we get is the first chapter of something great only to never hear it live on. Marvel is known as a one and done company, and will sacrifice creative freedom in order to maintain their brand. That is why none of their heroes have established themes. So far no single composer has composed a sequel to their original score for a Marvel Studios picture, none! Alan Silvestri followed up Captain America with The Avengers, but it seems hes out of the picture now and will not be back for Avengers 2. Brian Tyler did Iron Man 3, but was a replacement for the rejected Carter Burwell on Thor 2. Djawadi was unjustly dumped after Iron Man, Patrick Doyle went when Kenneth Branagh quit Thor 2, and Debney was dismissed after he didn't have Jon Favreau pulling for him. So now comes in Henry Jackman, who is probably one of the smartest composers working today. I can imagine he assumed this would be his only shot, so he dared to be fresh and original. He didn't abide to the expected and instead delivered an edgy, engaging and momentous score that superbly stands on its own as it takes Captain America into his new modern setting.\n\nWhat I found so fantastic about The Winter Soldiers score was that Henry Jackman seemed to be able to get away with a lot of things, in a good way. He was allowed to exercise his craft and utilize his style. Most composers would probably have gone the easy route, the expected route. Jackman instead crafts a precise action thriller that never blankets the images on the screen, but instead supports them from underneath like an excellent score should. While Silvestris Captain America theme is referenced in the film, this score has its own central motif. Jackmans central motif is a simple pulsing rhythm woven with heroism that anchors the whole score. From there we get to experience intricate electronic textures that propel the action and for the first time in Marvel Studios history, real gravitas is added. The Winter Soldier's motif is a chilling electronic scream that announces his presence, and it works so damn well. Every Marvel produced film to this point has seemed to take the Saturday morning cartoon route, but Jackman is not that kind of composer. Even in his animated ventures like Monsters Vs. Aliens, Wreck-It Ralph and Turbo he was able to add organic emotion over just shallow studio-built spectacle. This score embraces the modern setting of the story and Jackman wonderfully builds engaging electronic textures. Beyond the action the music carries a sense of wounded patriotism, and from there the music stems some great emotional moments. This of course builds to the inevitable track Time To Suit Up where Jackman carries us to our hero stepping into the spotlight to be the titular savior. The climax and resolution follow, but it all carries a hint of tragedy making it resonate even more.\n\nTheres been a lot of negative reactions to this score, and I think they are coming from people who seem to be put off by the new and unexpected. Also to those who haven't seen it function in the film. A good score supports the film, and in this case Henry Jackman does that and then some. He also pushes his score to do things differently and unexpectedly. He incorporates different flavors of patriotism and heroism that call back to classic political thrillers of the genre, but still embraces the kinetic action of this film. He balances somberness and intensity that help craft the arcs. The music never becomes over the top or hokey. In fact in certain areas it can become unsettling and uncomfortable, which is amazing that music can do that. We don't get any forced fanfare or bloated emotions. Everything is delivered on a precise edge that cuts sharp and resonates deep. Henry Jackmans Captain America: The Winter Soldier sets a new bar for the next composer to walk through the constantly revolving door of the Marvel Studios composer hot seat. And more impressively is that his style and approach were on full display showing a creative growth as a composer. If Henry Jackman makes history and isn't replaced for Captain America 3 it will be interesting to see where he takes it, but if he goes the way like those before him he will still have left a lasting mark.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Wow, I wonder how many times Barbra can regurgitate the same songs on an album.  ENOUGH, already.  I have those same 10 songs that she has been recycling to the point where I hate every one of them.  One can only hope Barry Gibb is sitting with pen in hand as I speak whipping up some songs to sing with her that I can stand to listen to.  I used to be such a big fan till she couldn't learn a new song.  who in the world has not heard her sing these same songs till we could cringe.  What I would like for her to do is use her massive talent on something most people are not sick of.  The public works pretty hard for their money and she keeps sending in the same old, same old all the time.  We can't recycle our work in the private sector.  In the meantime I listen to Rosalyn Kind and find her to be much better since she is so relaxed sounding.  I also discovered I like Lady Gaga.  At least she doesn't sing the same songs on every album.  What a waste of talent.  The public deserves better than she is giving for their money.  I am happy I got the mp3 download - much less money wasted and I am about ready to remove it from my mp3 player since I do not enjoy it.  What a disappointment.","classification":2,"fold":8}

{"text":"By all accounts, I should not like this song.  I don't know a word of Korean, so most of the lyrics went straight over my head.  I don't listen to Asian pop much, so the style is one I'm unfamiliar with.  And the fact that Psy doesn't actually sing for most of the song, instead mainly talking over the music, should have turned me off.  I should have dismissed the song as a passing fad and gone on with my life.\n\nBut I made the mistake of listening to the song on YouTube... and it lodged itself in my brain.  And I ended up liking it well enough to purchase a copy.  It's no musical masterpiece, but dang is it catchy and fun.\n\nFor those more used to American-style music, \"Gangnam Style\" is something of a departure from it.  It's heavy on the synthesizer, much like a lot of the hits of the '80s, and has a fast, almost frantic beat to it.  As stated before, Psy talks his way through most of the song, only singing at the chorus (he does do a decent job of singing, though, so it's not for lack of talent).  This gives the song almost something of a rap feel, though it sounds quite different from traditional rap.  And of course, it's an upbeat number that almost encourages the listener to get up and dance -- I find it almost physically impossible to hold still while listening to this song.\n\nAnd no, I don't understand any of the lyrics aside from the titular \"Gangnam style\" (said to refer to a city) and the occasional belting out of \"Hey, sexy lady!\"  No, I don't know if it fits in the context of the song or not... XD\n\nCall me a sell-out, but I rather enjoyed this song.  It's a fun and upbeat dance number, even if you don't know how to do the signature dance that goes with it.  Good as an introductory number to K-Pop, and a fun party number.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"You will need to leave what you think at the door if you are like me and what I thought of Marilyn Manson. I have been a fan to the point. I liked the songs I heard on the radio, but thought Marilyn was just too far out there. I finally bought an album of his new songs. The CD is titled The Pale Emperor. It was just released a week or so ago. I am really impressed with this work. Yes Marilyn is a trip, but the band compliments his broken vocals perfectly. The bass and drums are steady and are not over complicated. The bass player strums at times (it is so cool) and gives the music a power soul sound that separates this band from most. The guitar work is excellent, but not in the way we normally think. The guitar sounds are sometimes strained cords and notes that in most other bands would be in error, but in this band they are perfect. No one on the band plays to much. This is the mark of a very tight and unselfish band. The sound is very well balanced as well by Brian Lucey.\n\nYes Marilyn looks and acts weird. His vocal approach is strange, but Bob Dylan did alright with odd vocals. I obviously do not know, but from what I have gathered from his lyrics and the fact that he dedicated this album to his mother, tells me he is.... yes very artistic, but knows how to stay relevant, write good songs, and sell music. His lyrics are deceiving. He uses words that take you in one direction, but really mean something else. \"I don't need a Motherfxxxxx looking down on me\" for example. When I first heard this I wondered is he talking about God. As you listen to the song he also says \"Least I know where ever I go I have the devil beneath my feet\". The way I interpret this is he believes in God and glad he is not with the devil. The rest of the songs are equally as interesting\n\nThe style of the music was also a surprise. Most of the songs are not the same pace as the radio song. They are slow and powerful with a lot more acoustic guitar and open strumming electric six string than you would think. I am telling you, this band and it's off the wall singer are more acceptable than you probably think. The songs are well written and could be covered by anyone.\n\nI am now a Marilyn Manson fan..","classification":5,"fold":8}

With tons of setbacks and vocal woes initially, this rose has truly blossomed from the concrete and it radiates in her latest effort 'Woman to Woman'! Beautiful music at it's best.

Keyshia keeps the melodies, the pain, the hurt, the love, and the joys all warped into her music. A real singer has to experience real life situations before they can make a song that we can all relate to; Mrs. Cole-Gibson personifies this. I won't do a track by track evaluation because I love all the songs on this album. I do have to shout out the song 'Hey Sexy' because Keyshia you went old school on us throwing in the Betty Wright 'Tonight Is The Night' reference: \"I know you not going to sing that song!\" I Love It! Keep making beautiful music Keyshia, you will always have our support. I was really hoping for another duet from Keyshia and my favorite singer Monica on this effort but maybe on a future project!

{"text":"I'm a die-hard, long-time fan of Pink Floyd. I discovered them in college and have all of their albums. They are one of my all-time favorite groups, in all of their iterations. I love everything from their early work (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Piper-At-The-Gates-Of-Dawn\/dp\/B004ZN9ERI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn<\/a>) to their more processed studio sound (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Division-Bell\/dp\/B00KBNRZ9K\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Division Bell<\/a>). For the most part, 'The Endless River' is refined outakes from the Division Bell recording sessions, with some newer editing indroduced and some occasional nods to the past. It has the same vibe and sound as Division Bell and is primarily instrumental, with Gilmoure's guitarwork, Mason's percussion, and much of Wrights's keyboard work being the focus. It flows well, is expertly produced, and is an enjoyable listen. Gilmoure is the primary vocalist, but Stephen Hawking makes a brief return cameo on track 14. It is more or less an instrumental continuation of where Pink Floyd was headed after&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Delicate-Sound-of-Thunder\/dp\/B0000026NC\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Delicate Sound of Thunder<\/a>. Not groundbreaking songwriting, but it is sonic candy. Electronic and keyboard lovers should find a lot to like here since this is essentially a tribute to Rick Wright.\n\nThe Endless River is no&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Wish-You-Were-Here\/dp\/B004ZN9T00\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wish You Were Here<\/a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Dark-Side-of-the-Moon\/dp\/B00EVSACLE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dark Side of the Moon<\/a>.  I can't help but wonder how it might have been different if Roger Waters was part of the mix. It would have been nice. It hurts me to say that while I find it a very competent add-on to The Division Bell, it is lacking as a stand-alone album. That won't keep me from listening to it though. I recommend newcomers to Pink Floyd try out some of the previously mentioned albums before getting The Endless River. Long time fans will either love it for being a Floyd album or hate it for not being what they had hoped for.\n\nI give it 3.5 stars (5 for my personal enjoyment) but round it down for objective review purposes.\n\n~ Kort","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"\"In Colour\" is the solo debut by Jamie Smith of the xx. It comes across as a dizzying minimalist late night at the disco. It comprises instrumentals like \"Sleep Sound\" (which incorporates chimes), the steel drum-driven \"Obvs\", the harrowing-sounding hip hop-laced \"Hold Tight\", the trippy \"The Rest Is Noise\" (with interesting textures), and the groovy \"Girl\" (with disembodied-sounding vocal samples).\n\nThe swirling \"Seesaw\" features the fractured vocals of xx bandmate Romy Madley. She appears again on the dreamy \"Loud Places\" (which is anything but, and sounds like a disco song left to wash out in the rain - absolutely beautiful!). Bandmate Oliver Sim features on the sublime and magical \"Stranger In A Room\", the closest thing to a ballad. \"Want to change your colours just for the night\" he croons against the skeletal piano\/guitar backdrop. \"I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times)\" features Young Thug and Popcaan lending the song a chirpy soulful dancehall groove.\n\nLate night cool.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"When Lupe Fiasco debuted in 2006, he created a modern day intstant classic with his debut \"Food & Liquor\". He followed it up with his Gold selling sophomore smash \"The Cool\", which yielded the huge radio hit \"Superstar\". He went into the studio to record what would have been \"Lasers\". Unfortunately, he got into it with Atlantic Records over the creative direction of the album. He wanted to make the music he was known for while Atlantic had a different objective. They wanted him to make a commercially viable album to piggyback on the success of \"The Cool\". They took it one step further by handing him certain songs that he needed to do for the record company. This resulted in a battle that Lupe took to the media to air out his greivances and refused to comply with Atlantic's demands. After almost a two year standoff, Lupe and Atlantic agreed to release \"Lasers\" in March 2011- an album that saw the biggest numbers of his career, but also garnered him much criticism. On his next album, he vowed he was going to do devoid of any label pressure. Hence the quick release of his fourth album \"Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album\".\n\nWhile his new album may invoke memories of his debut based on the title, that's where the similarities end. His new album takes a rather worldly approach- basically, it's what \"Lasers\" would have sounded like had Atlantic Records not imposed their will. He reunites with his longtime producer Soundtrakk on his criticism of the American government \"Strange Fruition\". He shows concern for the young children on \"ITAL (Roses)\", while discussing the ills of the community on \"Around My Way (Freedom Ain't Free)\". He works with the Southern hip hop production team The Runners (Rick Ross, Young Jeezy) on the songs \"Heart Donor\" as well as \"Brave Heart\". On the song \"B*tch Bad\", Lupe explores the irony and the hypocrisy surrounding women and the derogatory word in reference to music. He works with Austrailian singer Guy Sebastian on \"Battle Scars\" and gets help from neo-soul singer Bilal on \"How Dare You\". Overall, \"Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album\" is a solid album from Lupe Fiasco. However, after listening one gets the feeling that he wants to follow on the success on his previous album- but on his own terms. Despite the album's leaning towards a more mainstream sound, Lupe is still as outspoken as ever.","classification":4,"fold":8}
{"text":"THIS is the version of this song to buy!  Unremastered, original dynamic range & fidelity.  Billy's piano sounds like it's right in the room on even a small stereo.\n\nAvoid the other two versions offered on here - the \"Millennium\" and the \"Ultimate\" - both labeled \"Remastered\" - all the label did was have the engineers make them LOUDER to volume match modern pop recordings.  To do this, all the dynamics were clipped off, and the quieter parts of the song gained up to full-scale.  It sounds like a rush of NOISE past my ears!  The drums and the piano lose focus and are no louder or softer than the other elements of the song.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Another incredible album from Deftones. Whether or not it's one of their best is hard to say so early on. I will say straight up though that I think it's better than Diamond Eyes and Koi No Yokan, and I loved those albums. Gore is an artistic statement from a band that's not just comfortable, but ready and willing to try some new sounds. The songwriting is tight, focused, and urgent. There's such a cool sound and flow to these songs. I also think this is their most mature album to date.\n\n There's a couple bangers here, Doomed User and Gore, but the album as a whole chooses a more flowing atmospheric sound. Those looking to rock out like it's their Adrenaline or Around The Fur days will be sorely underwhelmed. If however, you have accepted their newer sonic exploration, you will be treated to a darkly beautiful album with many different moods and dare I say tones.","classification":5,"fold":8}

The best of his best to me has to be \"Born To Run\". There are many I know who have their own person favorite and could make a good argument for their choice of favorite Springsteen song. And I would agree with their reasons. But for me there is something about this early hit by the \"Boss\" that has an intensity level and sound to it that just can't be compared to any other. The longing and aching sung in the lyrics by Bruce of a guy who just wants to take his girl Wendy and find a better place for them, a better life. Bruce really gets into this song. That to me is what makes this song so good. If there is only one Bruce Springsteen song you could download on to your MP3 player this would be that song.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"...I do not mean any disrespect AT ALL. This is NOT sarcasm: People that are in one of the greatest bands ever, should NOT get near a plane! Seeing them in the sky is as close as you should get...ever. This song sums up Lynyrd Skynyrd. The older VanZandt brother and a couple of other band members and crew died in a crash. It seems very odd to me that so many great musicians lost their lives jetting around. These guys lived they're lives just like the moral of this song. They did not play for fame and fortune. They never let themselves be changed one bit when all the other bands were going \"hair band.\" They were good ol' boys from Alabama that played songs that had a certain timeless and profound pride in being just that: good folks. Skynyrd touched so many of us (now middle aged) people when WE were the future. It was our turn to run the world, and being humble, respectful, and doing the right thing was important. Now that we've retired, the world is way too small, and common courtesy seems but a distant memory. Everything they put out went platinum. Their first song, to the last, was straight up American. The whole Rock Music world mourned when that plane went down. That was it. The other members went back home and would have never played again. BUT! Those guys knew that the older brother, Johnny, I believe (God forgive me if I've got the two mixed up) would want them to try to show the world what was being lost and try to get people to just slow down, realise what is truly important in life; forget greed, be kind and respectful, and just live, simple. Because, \"if you do, you will be satisfied.\" Fans of all different kind of music came to see a band that was not really a band any more. All these people came to listen and give their respects. Skynyrd toured one more time. The younger VanZandt brother finally put his grief away for long enough to tour one more time. The whole venue was packed. We went and seen them at Starwood Amphitheatre in Nashville. The younger brother wore a flat brimmed hat just like his older brother used to. He stepped up to the mic and did something he swore not to do...it just hurt too bad: He sang his brothers songs. They played, I swear it was like Jonny was there. Freebird was last song of course....\n\nAnd that's all I have to say about that.","classification":5,"fold":8}

This version went to #1 making Dolly the only artist to ever have the same song go to #1 twice.\n\n More pop sounding than her 1974 version \"I Will Always Love You\" was produced by her band leader Gregg Perry. Many have said this version is a bit inferior than 1974's, but Dolly's voice here is pure, heartfelt and filled with emotion. Dolly herself was going through a breakdown in her own personal life at the time of this recording in early 1982 as she battled weight problems, family issues, an attempt by people to blackmail her and a personal heartache that she refuses to talk about. This all led to the amazing vocal range on this track.\n\n Also, the song would only peak at #53 Pop, but would garner Dolly a Grammy nod for Best Country Vocal Performance.","classification":5,"fold":8}

I have heard other songs by her but I would have to also put \"Your Love Is My Drug\" as one of the songs that I had heard on the radio during the summer of 2010 that grew on me.

Many of the songs combine dance, electronica, and pop in a strong way that fits well with the \"Warrior Theme\".  \"Warrior\", \"Crazy Kids\", \"Wherever You Are\", \"Dirty Love\" (featuring Iggy Pop), \"Supernatural\", \"All That Matters\" (The Beautiful Life), and \"Past Lives\" are only some of the catchy multiple songs on this cd.  \"Warrior\" by Kesha is great if you enjoy musical tracks with pop and electronic elements.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I've been seeing alot of mixed reviews for this album and I understand why. Snoop released 2 masterpiece rap albums and was essential to \"The Chronic\" with Dr. Dre and there's a big portion of people (including me) who would like him to make a knockout rap album again like Doggystyle or Doggfather. For the longest time, I didn't listen to anything Snoop put out after the Doggfather because my skepticism wouldn't let me see how with every album he put out after that, Snoop grew a little more as an MC and a musician in general. After recently hearing everything else after Tha Doggfather, my opinion changed drastically about Snoop Dogg. He isn't \"doggystylin' on Death Row\" anymore with G-Funk beats backing him but \"Bush\" is proof that Snoop is talented musician, composer, and MC. This is funky and Snoop has a great singing voice. Pharrell's production, music, and beats suit Snoop perfectly. Say what you will about Pharrell, him and Snoop go together here like peanut butter and jelly. Snoop shines as an MC once in a while but rarely; instead he gets T.I., Kendrick Lamar, and Rick Ross to lay down some bars and they actually shine on here (don't normally care much for T.I.). Even Stevie Wonder works his magic on here, Charlie Wilson is consistent as always, and Gwen Stefani does well for what she contributes. I don't personally think this is as good as Doggystyle but it's completely different and shouldn't be compared to that. This is a solid funk\/rap album that Snoop should be proud of. Recommended to fans of the genre and all Snoop fans that won't be disappointed that he isn't rhyming all the time and is more concentrated on laying down the funk and singing.","classification":5,"fold":8}
{"text":"When you're scoring a movie these days, it seems you can't go wrong with Danny Elfman.  If you're Tim Burton, it's a match made in heaven.  Just as he's done for most of Burton's other movies, reaching all the way back to \"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure\", Elfman does it again.  He not only matches his spooky-charming musical touches to the Alice in Wonderland world that Burton visualizes, he borrows from some of his best material to do so.  Fans of Danny Elfman's earlier orchestrations will hear some of their favorites in here:  the airy vocals of \"Edward Scissorhands\", the whimsical-spooky flourishes of \"Corpse Bride\" and bits and pieces of the indescribable 'Elfman Sound' that sets him apart from his peers.  I downloaded this MP3 Album after being unable to locate a physical copy anywhere in my area, and I've no regrets:  the sound quality is great, and ripping high-quality MP3s to add to my library is what I would have done with the physical media anyway.\n\nIf you enjoyed the movie and\/or are a fan of Danny Elfman, the Alice in Wonderland soundtrack is worth the price.\n(NOTE:  This review is for the MP3 Download Album of the Alice in Wonderland score.

{"text":"I was not a fan of Hall & Oates back in the day. But covers are a different story. I was not a Bee Gees fan, either, but recently I've heard some superb covers of Bee Gees tunes -- new versions that in my opinion surpass the originals. One of these is The Bird And The Bee's cover of How Deep Is Your Love. Inara George and her bandmate bring out depths in that tune that I can't find in the Bee Gees' recording.\n\nListening to these Hall & Oates interpretations by The Bird And The Bee makes me realize how well-crafted the songs themselves were. And there is no faulting the technical perfection of the playing and singing here.\n\nBut this album sounds like a very good demo tape to me. The drum machines, the multitude of synth keyboards -- some of which can sound awfully cheesy, seem more like a suggestion of what a fully produced album ought to be. Contrast this with The Bird And Bee's performance of I Can't Go For That on the Ellen show, with real drums, real bass -- essentially a full band. The live performance comes off much more successfully.\n\nThe other problem I have with the CD is that Inara George's clean, pure, pretty voice is perfect for the kind of slinky, cool, ironic stuff that we find on The Bird And The Bee's original songs. Sorry, but there isn't a lot of soul or emotion on this CD. She's singing the songs, but she doesn't sound like she's really committed to them. The exception is One On One, where Inara convinces me with the vocal, but the strange keyboard sounds in the break sort of break the spell.\n\nI would have rather seen the band pick four of the best arrangements of their Hall & Oates favorites, record them with a full band -- I think a guitar or two would be appropriate -- and then let Inara George stretch out a bit vocally. That might have been a great EP.\n\nI have the band's other releases. On this, I will probably pass. I'm looking forward to more cover songs from this band, but I hope they use more authentic instruments. The excess of keyboards on this album started to get to me.","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"As soon as the opening notes of \"All the Rage Back Home\" kick in, there's something strangely comforting about Interpol's post-punk sensibilities and frontman Paul Banks' melancholy yet energetic voice. After a four year absence El Pintor is akin to visiting an old friend: it's a warm and driving experience that does exactly what you expect it to do.\n\nInterpol has had the unfortunate case that many successful bands have after delivering a stunning debut, and that's living in the shadow of early success. Each album has been them grow and expand while never straying too far from the original template that made them critical darlings. I've enjoyed each record but have to admit that their 2010 self-titled effort was a plodding and depressing affair that showed some brilliant moments lost in a wave of uncertainty and turmoil. With this record the band sounds rejuvenated, with tracks like \"Anywhere\" and \"My Desire\" being among the band's best work in quite some time. \"Everything Is Wrong\" takes the group's moody dynamics and gives them room to breathe, hitting you with just the right amount of force and infectious groove. \"Breaker 1\" wouldn't sound out of place on Turn on the Bright Lights or Antics. This is definitely an album that draws on their earlier work, which is sure to delight fans who have been longing for something more straightforward and aggressive. It draws on all the band's previous work but there's definitely a rougher and spontaneous sound this time around.\n\nEl Pintor is a triumph for Interpol and a record that flows steadily from start to finish. There's nothing groundbreaking here; if you're familiar with Interpol then you have a good idea of what to expect. They're a band that's not likely to surprise us with anything too radical but in the end that doesn't matter. When the music's this good you just want it to continue and hopefully they will for many, many years.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"The Bach Guilds Big Jewish Music Box?\nYes, indeed, this is it. We know, were now applying the Bach Guild brand to a series of recordings that never were released under The Bach Guild imprint, which is a first for us. However, this music spotlights another role that independent labels played in the latter part of the 20th century.\nSeymour Solomon (as we have mentioned endlessly) began The Bach Guild as an attempt to record all of Bachs cantatas, stating that at the time he started there were 1 and  Bach cantatas listed in the Schwann Guide to Recordings. Outside the Bach Guild imprint, Seymour and his brother Maynard explored other areas of untapped repertoire. Vanguard was created as a sister label to run alongside The Bach Guild to expand beyond Bach  first into classical, then quickly into jazz and folk music.\nAnd there we begin the Jewish music journey. The Solomon brothers created many very fine recordings celebrating Hebrew, Yiddish and Jewish culture. They looked backwards to the music of the lands where the immigrants came, and also into their current times, recording songs and works of Jewish composers like Bloch and Copland. Sadly, due to copyright restrictions, many of those fine recordings are excluded on this new box, but we have a well-stocked collection, one that is almost completely new for digital release.\nThe music we have presented here is mainly taken from celebratory collection  and filled with goodies. Among the crown jewels of this collection are two Jewish folk song albums featuring Martha Schlamme. We released her practically unknown Christmas album two years ago, now we finally get into the 2nd Avenue spirit, and present the two albums she made for Vanguard in the early 1960s. Also available for the first time are the Yiddish and Hebrew folksong recordings of Netania Davrath.\nRobert deCormier and his orchestra play a large role, as he did a large number of arrangements for these folk song albums, and they are arrangements strongly in the 1950s movie soundtrack tradition  perhaps a bit heavier than todays tastes, but brimming with imagination and power. Same to be said for his orchestral recordings  and those of the Karmon Israeli Dancers and Orchestra. Theres not much intimate, reflective music here in this collection, and certainly not on these orchestral recordings.\nJan Peerce made several recordings for Vanguard, and here he performs a seder  so please be warned, there is spoken word included in this collection.\nIn the post-Vanguard Omega catalog we discovered some superb klezmer, and weve included that as well.\nBut now a moment to consider what we weren't able to put inthis is one of the few Big Boxes where there was a tremdendous amount of material that we couldn't include, due to mechanical copyright restrictions (we don't sell any copyrighted music  or else we couldn't sell these boxes for .99). Obvious omissions include (or exclude, really) Mischa Elmans fine Hebrew Melodies album, Herschel Bernardis live cabaret act, and the excellent Jewish Music in America recital with bass Leon Lishner.\nSo, please enjoy our playlist with the strangest title but certainly one of the finer boxes weve released since","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I admit that I first found out about the song Love Runs Out by One Republic on Thursday June 5, 2014 via youtube. The Love Runs Out video was advertised as a recommendation to me due to the fact that I happened to also be watching A Sky Full Of Stars by Coldplay and Summer by Calvin Harris.  I also first heard Love Runs Out through a radio station on iheart radio based out of Norfolk Virginia (Now 105). Love Runs Out creatively experiments with drums and an inspired gospel vibe. The music video shows a happy woman situated in front of a piano (both her and the singer are in a desert setting).  I remember spotting the Native cd at my job, but was unsure whether to get it due to the fact that I was unsure if it was for me. However, between enjoying this song and talking to a coworker rave about this group and the Native cd, I definitely intend to purchase this cd sometime within the next 6 months. This is because something about the energetic vibe of the song and the singer convincingly singing about that he plans to care about until the Love Runs Out (hence the title) makes me want to hear more.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Animal + Cannibal is a repacked edition of her debut album \"Animal\" and its follow-up the EP \"Cannibal\". Kesha is very similar to her peer Lady Gaga, the two of whom debuted at the same time; the music is pretty much the same so if you love Lady Gaga you'll definitely love Kesha. The difference between her and Lady Gaga is that Kesha's style is harder, she's the ultimate party girl, and she on a mission here to party non-stop. The songs are primarily dance tracks, with slightly harsh electronic (I think its electroclash not to sure on the sub-genre), but surprising it suits her voice, Dr. Luke and his cohorts did a wonderfully job with production despite the harsh electronic background that surrounds her, Kesha doesn't get lost in the mix and its her that stand in the forefront. Most of the tracks (the really goods ones) revolve around drinking, party, and boys. But please don't think for a minute that she is just another puppet most of it is written or co-written by her and she can actually sing. (Something she better demonstrates on Deconstructed). My favorites from \"Animal\" are Dancing with Tears in My Eyes, Tik Tok, Kiss N Tell, Your Love is My Drug, and Take it Off. From \"Cannibal\" are Grow a Pear, Sleazy, and Crazy Beautiful Life","classification":5,"fold":8}

Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button (triangle).\n\nOr, if you just want to build up your music collection the starving-college-student way, Amazon offers a ton of FREE music downloads.  Free songs...even free albums.  And more important than free. LEGAL.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music.  But, quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music.  In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.  Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nIf you think you might like this song...listen to a sample first.  No review will help you make a better decision than doing that.  I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was one of the Amazon freebies, previously mentioned.  However, the freebie selection on Amazon is constantly changing, so by the time you read this review, it may have a price attached.

{"text":"Two discs 46,78 minutes each approximately.  The sound is uniformly good.  The tracks have been cleaned up a bit,and the band comes through loud and clear.  The DVD is icing on the cake,with a number of great performances.  The box itself is cleverly done.  The outer box resembles an amp\/speaker,with all the settings on 10.  Inside this is a fold-out package with the three discs,which snap-in,which seems to be the way record companies are packaging things these days.  The booklet consists of many color photographs of the band on stage, and reproductions of band info\/biographies etc.  There are two pages devoted to track information,which while printed in small typeface,is pretty complete.\n\nThe first disc consists primarily of singles and tracks (not on the U.S. release) starting with the band's first album,\"High Voltage\".  These tracks show the band from their formative (1974) period,and are presented in chronological order,which is helpful,as it shows the growth of this band into the r&r juggernaut they became.  Not all the tracks are full-on r&r(\"Love Song\" as an example),but by the time listeners hear track four, \"R.I.P.(Rock in Peace)\",this is the AC\/DC familiar (sample lyric,\"I get my kicks playing my licks and laying my chicks down on Route 66\") to everyone who likes primal,full-on r&r.  Even the  slower songs (like \"Crabsody in Blue\") have that dirty,primal sound that the band was so famous for.\n\nThere are many listeners who feel that the (late) Bon Scott era was a high water mark for the band,and listening to the tracks with Scott,its hard to disagree.  Scott's voice is pure,visceral r&r at its best.  However,with the addition of Brian Johnson,replacing Scott,the band seemed to solidify into the overwhelming,powerful group that went on to define what r&r is all about.\n\nDisc two is filled with what AC\/DC was\/is all about-live in front of an ecstatic audience.  Starting with \"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\",the band shows what real deal r&r is all about.  The vocals are over the top yet spot on.  The sound of the guitars will leave marks in your head.  And the rhythm section (the bands secret weapon) keeps everything moving-seemingly propelling the rest of the band to greater heights.  This is a band that had not one,but two great vocalists.  Never mind which one listeners feel is better-on this collection it doesn't really matter.  The  pounding,exciting groove laid down by the band,as a whole,is simply devastating.\n\nEveryone will have their own favorites from this (\"Live Wire\",\"Let There Be Rock\",just two examples) collection.  Suffice to say,if you don't know what AC\/DC is all about-give this a listen.  This collection will tell you all you need to know.  For fans of the band-pick this up soon-you won't be disappointed.  In this day and age of limp reformations of old bands,and new imitators,AC\/DC clearly defines what makes great rock & roll.  This is timeless music,laid down with no thoughts except to pump out the best music possible.","classification":5,"fold":8}

I was nine years old when I begged my mother to buy me the cassette tape with the \"robot guy with the gun\" on the cover. Nine years old! The fifth grade! I'm twenty five now, and am still thankful to my mother for getting this album even if she wasn't crazy about the idea(remember, Iron Maiden were branded satanists thanks to people who based the band solely on their imagery). This album would change me forever. I had heard ...And Justice For All before this and loved it, but this one really opened my eyes to the whole heavy metal genre and what gems it holds. It's still my favorite Iron Maiden album today(barely beating 7th son, which I conned my mother into getting a short while later). Now, you know an album has to be good if it remains one of your favorites over 16 years.

{"text":"Mumford and Sons' debut album \"Sigh No More\" (2009 release) is one of those rare albums that comes out under the radar and then for some unknown reason, catches fire and slowly but surely keeps building, based on its incredible quality, word of mouth, and of course relentless touring by the band. By the time the band won several Grammys (and gave an unforgettable live performance with Bob Dylan at those Grammy Awards ceremony) in February 2011,, everyone wanted to get a piece of this UK band. Now comes the band's second album, and that it is highly anticipated, would be the understatement of the year.\n\n\"Babel\" (12 tracks; plus 3 tracks on the \"deluxe edition\"; 64 min.) starts off with an immediately classic sounding title track, in which the band explodes with vigor, bringing us all of the sounds that we have come to love, including of course the banjo. The subsequent several tracks are all in the same vein, just great. At track 5 \"Ghosts That We Knew\", we get the first more pensive track, with great lyrics like \"So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light\/Oh they gave me such a fright\/But I will hold on with all of my might\/Just promise me we'll be alright\", wow. The second half of the album brings a mix of up-tempo and slower songs, and it's hard to point out highlights as such, as this album plays like a whole, rather than just separate songs. On the last track of the album \"Not With Haste\", Marcus Mumford again is in a contemplative mood, crooning, as the album ends \"Do not let my fickle flesh go to waste\/As it helps my heart and soul in its place\/And I will love with urgency\/But not with haste\", what a beautiful way to close the album.\n\nThe deluxe edition comes with 3 extra tracks, all of them worth getting: \"For Those Below\", Where Are You Now\" and sandwiched in between those a cover of Simon & Garfunkel's \"The Boxer\", in a way I'm quite sure you've never heard that song before, no bombastic outro here!. Interestingly, in the liner notes, it credits Paul Simon as one of the musicians on the track, but I couldn't tell from listening (he surely is not on vocals, so probably on acoustic guitar). All that aside, \"Babel\" is a fantastic album, let there be no doubt about it, no sophomore slump for these guys! And for a few extra bucks, the \"deluxe\" edition is definitely the one to get. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":5,"fold":8}

It is refreshing to hear a woman's voice singing about a man who knows how to give her what she likes (sexually, but that is only implied).  Additionally, the couple in question has a long-standing relationship, and the woman wants to spend her life in a relationship with him.  She's in lust...errr...love with him.  So this is a song about enjoying sex, but it's equally a song about enjoying a relationship built upon mutual respect.  What a nice message.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"In prelude to a thorough reissue of his album catalog, Billy Joel is celebrated on this first-ever career-spanning domestic single disc anthology. Joel's catalog has been excerpted more fully on the three-disc Greatest Hits series&nbsp;&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/2\/dp\/B000002BBP\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">2<\/a>] and multidisc sets&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Essential\/dp\/B00005OSX8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Essential<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Complete-Hits\/dp\/B00005NNM8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Complete Hits<\/a>, but this is the first time his lengthy catalog has been condensed to a single U.S. CD. The nineteen tracks provide a compact tour through twenty-three years of music-making, selecting recordings from every Joel album from 1971's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Cold-Spring-Harbor\/dp\/B0012GMX6K\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cold Spring Harbor<\/a>&nbsp;through 1993's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/River-of-Dreams\/dp\/B0012GMWF2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">River of Dreams<\/a>. The selections mostly follow his hit-making, though the inclusion of the non-single \"Everybody Loves You Now\" and the non-charting \"New York State of Mind\" helps flesh out the hit-maker's further identity as an album artist. This isn't a complete recitation of even Joel's biggest hits - \"Just the Way You Are\" and \"Uptown Girl\" are missing, the latter perhaps a victim of divorce - but it's a musically satisfying 80-minute tour through a rich catalog of hit singles and multiplatinum albums. Radio and concert favorites like \"Piano Man,\" \"Only the Good Die Young,\" \"Big Shot,\" \"You May Be Right,\" \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\" and \"We Didn't Start the Fire\" will give Joel's fans a charge and provide a great introduction to those who didn't live through his hit-making years. Joel's fascination with `60s doo-wop is heard in \"The Longest Time\" and his affection for Brill Building pop is lovingly evoked by the Ronettes-styled \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood.\" This is a good buy at a great price for those new to Joel's catalog, especially if you're not ready to pay for a multi-disc set. This collection fills a niche for newcomers; fans will have to wait for the album reissues to get their hands on rarities and previously unreleased tracks. 4-1\/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

I bought this album for 99 cents at a Korvettes store.\n\nThis is one of Cher's signature albums as an artist, as opposed to entertainer.  Believe me, I make no hierarchal distinctions between artist and entertainer -- both are needed in society.  Cher, the entertainer, has brought me so much pleasure since I was a kid.  Cher, the artist, when singing a song like \"These Days,\" or \"Love Hurts,\" bares her soul.\n\nWhat I find curious, still, is that even after Cher returned to Warner Brothers in the late '90s for the biggest album of her career, that her four Warner Brothers albums from the 1970s (including \"Two The Hard Way\" with Gregg Allman) remained unavailable.  In my \"man on the street\" opinion, these albums would have sold quite well if released after \"Believe\" became a blockbuster.

{"text":"Prime Cuts: Unlovable, Need You Now, Say Your Name\n\nSometimes God speaks through some of the most unexpected people.  Ask Tiffany Arbuckle Lee aka Plumb.  Way back in the year 2000, Plumb was at the cusp of leaving her singing career after being haggard by the politics of the industry.  Just as Plumb sang her swan song at her farewell concert, a girl gave her note detailing how the song \"Damaged\" had rescued her from despair and how she had hoped that Plumb would continue to use her music as a vessel of God's healing. Taking this as an ominous sign from God, Plumb realized that her life's mission had yet to be complete.  So, she signed with the esteemed Curb Records in 2003 and has so far blessed us with three studio albums and a compilation collection.  More importantly, Plumb has a unique way of ministering God's healing to troubled souls especially teenagers suffering from abuse or shattered self-images with songs such as \"Boys Don't Cry,\" \"Nice, Nave and Beautiful,\" \"Cut,\" \"Real\" and \"God-Shaped Hole.\"  \"Need You Now,\" Plumb's fourth studio album under the Curb imprint, will no doubt continue to advance such a Godly ministry with its lyrically poignant songs addressing issues of faith in the plight of our brokenness.  Hard to imagine, though is that \"Need You Now\" is Plumb's first album of all new material since 2007's \"Blink.\"  While \"Blink\" was a sonic detour into heavy ballads and lullabies, \"Need You Now\" is a return to her signature form of electronic rock\/pop.  Plumb again joins Jars of Clay's guitarist Matt Bronleewe in crafting most of the tunes with the occasional scribal input from Ben Glover, Joy Williams and Jars of Clay front man Dan Haseltine.\n\nThe songs of Plumb have always straddled between the fine line between human love and divine love.  Such ambiguity has certainly given her the advantageous edge of taking her songs beyond the Contemporary Christian genre.  To date, three of Plumb's songs (\"In My Arms,\" \"Hang O\" and \"Drifting\") have even climbed up to the upper echelon of Billboard's Dance charts.  And her 2003 hit \"Real\" even made quite a splash in the UK secular chart.  The same is said of the majority of the tracks here on \"Need You Now.\"  Though God is never mentioned, album opener \"Invisible\" could be read as a desperate cry for a lover's attention or God's redemption.  A brassy and soulful tune, \"Invisible\" calls to mind Adele's \"Skyfall\" where the majestic clamour of orchestra and the ethereal swirling of electronica meet.  \"Drifting,\" the album's debut single, is more a mainline rock ballad with Jars of Clay's Dan Haseltine helping build to the song's stratospheric climax. While songs like the cutesy \"Chocolate and Ice Cream\" and \"One Drop\" are more overtly romantic flurries with Plumb adopting some of Colbie Caillat-inspired sparkling Californian electronic bells and syncopated beats.\n\nMonths before the release of this album, Plumb has tweeted that this release was supposed to be titled \"Faster than a Bullet\" (a phrase taken from the song \"At Arm's Length\").  However, the recent tragic shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School have rendered such a titular inappropriate.  Feeling overwhelmed by the whole catastrophe, Plumb has dedicated the album's second single \"Need You Now\" to the family and friends of the victims.  The title cut \"Need You Now\" is the nerve center of this record.  It is also one of Plumb best compositions to date:  passionately delivered over a mid-tempo string-laden ballad, this is also Plumb most explicit cry to God mentioning Him not with a mere pronoun but by name.  \"Unlovable\" is the other track that is more religiously explicit-here Plumb addresses the hypocritical nature of some churches who have tasted God's grace but yet thrifty in extending it to others.  While \"Say Your Name\" is an anthemic cry to God; it is wistfully built up by a cacophony of strings, a tremulous drum beats and a rush of synthesizers.\n\n\"At Arm's Length\" sounds like words lifted out of the book of Hosea where God is pictured as a love sick paramour desperately calling us to be reconciled to Him.  But here also lies the problem with this album:  though it is true and right to speak of God as our forlorn lover waiting for us and the Bible is replete with such examples.  But God on the other hand is holy; in an album where God is spoken of in the guise of the generic \"he,\" it's hard to convey that in such rhetoric.  Hence, what is missing from \"Need You Now\" is that the glorious \"otherness\" of God sometimes is compromised over our human longings.  Also, when Plumb does mention God by name (as in the title cut) there is such power, such sweetness, such comfort that it really behooves us why God and Jesus are not mentioned more often.  Let's just wish with the next album Plumb will let Jesus out of the closet a tad more.","classification":3,"fold":8}

Her song Roar from that album is absolutely a cheater in song as well, which sounds too close in ear to what Sara Bareilles did with Brave earlier this year, which honestly was a much dearer song in voice and sonnet. I really didn't find the song to be a s empowering as was the case with her influence Queen. I really found the song to not only not deliver, but I found it to be another boring pop song that had lackluster drive in the words of a diva. If you are a hard core Katy Perry fan, you'll want this song, but it isn't really worth the money and the roar.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":8}

This was an excellent theme song for the 1977 James Bond movie entitled \"The Spy Who Loved Me.\" From the very beginning with that stunning solo piano arrangement to the very last note, Carly Simon and these musicians couldn't have done this ballad any better!\n\nThe lyrics are wonderful, too--they are about a man who has quite a hold on his woman who adores him and who truly believes that \"nobody does it better;\" \"nobody does it half as good as you\" and \"Baby, baby, darlin', you're the best.\" True, there's a tiny hint that the woman would like to not be quite so mesmerized by her man with the lyrics \"And nobody does it better \/ Though sometimes I wish someone could \/ Nobody does it quite the way you do \/ Why'd you have to be so good?\" but this thought it never seriously entertained because \"There's some kind of magic inside you \/ That keeps me from runnin' \/ But just keep it comin' \/ How'd you learn to do the things you do?\"\n\nThis has got to be one of the best songs I've ever heard.

{"text":"Josh Groban has always been a great singer.  What is really amazing is that after years of voice lessons he is noticeably better.  How could he improve what was already so great?  He managed.  Everything is clearer, purer, richer, better executed.  His lowest notes used to be his downfall & he sometimes struggled with them, but no more.  His higher range notes sound more relaxed, more powerful, clearer.  Unbelievable.  The one oddity, for a near-operatic baritone, is that he relies a great deal on falsetto, which sometimes works well, but not always.\n\nThe sound on this album is just crystal clear, clean, awesome.  I've never heard anything sound so clean.\n\nJosh wrote 11 of the songs on this album, mostly with collaborators.  This is more than he's written before.  The songs include quite a bit of variety, with some sounding distinctly classical, others sounding more like folk ballads, and one (\"The War At Home\") sounding just a little bit country-ish.  The lyrics and sound are generally moving and thought provoking.\n\nThe album is missing some of the more avante-guarde elements of some of his earlier albums -- and generally comes off as more traditional -- and yet not traditional.  His melodies always take unexpected twists.  His voice makes unexpected shifts in timbre.  Just as you think you're in familiar territory musically, suddenly you're not.  But the stuff he did with Mouquet and Heap in the past were more experimental, which is the one thing I really miss on this album, though \"Voce Existe in Mim\" has a bit of the quality of those prior works of Josh's.\n\nIn the past, I saw him as part of an international community of fusionists who were working to fuse elements of all sorts of music together to form new sounds.  I saw him as the first mainstream new music composer; but this album isn't like that so much.  Its newness is more subtle.  It does not really sound like anything else that's been out there before, while not using any exotic elements.\n\nJosh is profoundly creative, one of the most revolutionary forces in music today, a real genius -- one who picks up the torch of classical music and moves it in new directions.  And, yet, there is that hypnotic singability of some of the choruses.\n\nJosh considers this to be essentially a \"live\" album.  Many songs were \"one take.\"  And, yet, you don't notice.  It is all apparently flawless.\n\nInstruments: predominantly piano and strings\n\nComments about some individual songs -- all having a rich and soaring sound, BTW:\n\nWandering kind: an instrumental piece composed by Josh when he was 12, with added musicians.  Complex, beautiful, cheerful\n\nBells of New York City: minor, mournful\n\nGalileo:  A cover of an Irish song by Declan O'Rourke.  This is the one song I find annoying on here.  While a pretty song, it takes as its theme bemusement at the idea of a scientist falling in love and not finding a scientific explanation for his feelings.  As a scientist, I find this offensive, as it seems to imply that scientists are not naturally human and that it's odd for us to be just like everyone else.\n\nL'Ora Dell'Adio: the most operatic of these pieces.  It really show cases the maximum magnificence of Josh's voice.  Lyrics in Italian.\n\nHidden Away: the first released single of which there is an official music video featuring Miss Kentucky 2009.  This starts out with a very sweet, pop-like tone, but deteriorates into a sequence with many rough transitions between baritone and falsetto.  This is not my favorite one of the songs musically, but it's starting to grow on me.  It has a very nice message about trying to be positive and loving, rather than keeping warmth inside.\n\nAu Jardin de sans pourquoi:  I find this one particularly beautiful, though he does have a tendency to go back and forth over the same interval a lot.  Lyrics in French.  one of the few where Josh wrote the music alone, though it's considered a \"cover\" of another piece, presumably because of the words)\n\nHigher Window:  a very beautiful, but sad love song about a man who may have missed his chance after initially rejecting a woman.\n\nIf I Walk Away:  This is a love song with a very catchy & singable chorus.  A fun one.\n\nLove Only Knows: Another one with a very catchy and singable chorus -- very hard to get out of my head, but leaving me with a feeling that this guy is ultimately going to get hurt.\n\nVoce Existe in Mim:  This is my personal favorite.  It has a huge sound with very unusual sequences, where the voice is not so dominant and the instrumentals are very strong.  This is probably the most experimental sounding one, and features a large all female drumming group.  Lyrics in Portuguese.\n\nWar at Home: This one has a slight hint of country sound.  It's about soldiers who have suffered in war.  Josh wrote this after a visit to Walter Reed Hospital.  It's very, very moving -- very hard to get out of my head.  I predict that this is going to be the most popular out of this album.\n\nLondon Hymn: This is heavy on the instrumentals, with Josh blending in, very orchestral and choral. In Latin.\n\nStraight to You: a cover of a rock song by Nick Cave.  Well, if you're a rock fan, you won't like it.  If you're a pop\/classical fan, you wouldn't like the original and will like this one much better.\n\n---------------------\n\nAddendum\n\nAfter listening to this at least five more times now, I am struck by a pervasive sadness about the thing.  It sounds like Josh's love life hasn't been going very well.  There is a sense of yearning in all the songs -- of pain, really.  Josh is such a clown in his spoken life, and sometimes he wonders why people think he is so serious, but the music sounds very serious, almost grim.\n\n--------------------\n\nSecond Addendum\n\nIn his \"Before We Begin\" concert at Union Chapel, Josh explained that \"London Hymn\" was written in London, shortly after he wrote \"The War at Home.\"  It is a sort of quiet requiem piece that has afterthoughts about his visit to Walter Reed Hospital.\n\n-----------------\nThird addendum\n\nIn his \"Before We Begin\" concert in Toronto, Jan. 13, Josh explained that \"Au jardin des sans pourquoi\" had lyrics written by Rufus Wainwright and his mother, both of whom are or were noted songwriters. though Josh wrote the music .  At one of the \"Before We Begin\" concerts, Wainright came up to ask if the song had made it onto the record.  It turned out it was the only song he had written with his mother and she had died shortly thereafter.\n\n----------------\nFourth addendum:\n\nI saw a recent interview where Josh said that \"If I Walk Away\" was written to his parents and other people in his life who keep him grounded -- to encourage them to continue keeping him grounded.","classification":5,"fold":8}

I was watching Good Morning America hoping to see the Indy 4 trailer, and then I saw her. The most amazing...Singer I'd ever seen. Amazing doesn't even begin to describe her. I mean...WOW! Let's just say, it's better if you watch her on the TV.\n\nBut, then I heard the song on radio again, and then my eyes and heart were open. Here was an honest, sweet, unconventional, amazing love song. I mean, are there enough adjectives to describe this song? Probably not, I mean, who writes lyrics like,\"I buy you Rogaine, when you start losing all your hair.\" I mean, it's perfect. More than perfect even. The verses are stunning, and the chorus will blow you out of your seat. I mean, does music get any better?\n\nOverall, this might be the greatest song of all time, by an amazing artist with such talent, skill and mastery. Simply put, BUY THIS SONG!!! And while you're at it, watch her music video, go to her website [...] and support her work!\n\nNote: Although this probably makes no difference, I used to run a now defunct blog that had a shrine to her, but I'm not partial at all to her.\n\nNote to Amazon Technical Staff: Before your MP3 section is taken off technical \"beta,\" make sure songs don't disappear, then reappear, and make sure reviews aren't \"eaten\" when this does happen.

{"text":"I was there in 1991 when \"Crazy\" began a somewhat heavy rotation on radio. I don't remember seeing the video that often, though. I decided to pick up \"Seal\" and was impressed. It wasn't what I thought it was going to be, it was something else entirely, and better. I saw Trevor Horn was producer, which I thought was interesting as I already knew him from The Buggles and Art Of Noise, Yes and Frankie Goes To Hollywood. After listening to \"Seal\" over and over, I knew it was something special that the majority of the music listening population had overlooked.\n\nIn 1994, I was the first at the music store to pick up my copy of \"Seal\". I didn't know what to think of it right away. It was very different from his debut. I saw that Horn was still on the production, though. After repeated listening, I began to hear that it was just as classic as his debut. However, in 1995, that stupid \"Batman Forever\" soundtrack derailed everything for Seal. \"Kiss From A Rose\" was not supposed to be in a Batman movie. Was it Seal, or his record company, to blame for allowing it to be attached to that asinine film. I hate it with a passion. Now, all anyone remembers about Seal is that song from that film. They don't even know it came from his second album released a year earlier than the film.\n\nIn 1998, I was the first at the music store to pick up \"Human Being\". Again, wasn't sure what to make of it at first. It was very different from his first two albums, and judging by the cover, it was (and still is) his darkest, moodiest album. Over time, I realized it was just as classic as his first two albums, but critics and the public had either grown tired of Seal (thanks, Batman), or indifferent to his style of music (changing music business).\n\nI had heard about \"Togetherland\" and that it was shelved, and I guess we'll never get a proper release of that one because, apparently, Seal felt it wasn't good quality--WHAT??!! You allowed \"Soul\" and \"Soul 2\" to get out the door, what crap those were! And let's not even talk about \"Seal 6: Commitment\".\n\nIn 2003, I was pleased, after such a long wait, to have \"Seal IV\", but it was his first album that I felt wasn't quite up to par. It was good, but not classic. In 2007, I felt the same about \"System\". Then all hell broke loose.\n\nI'm sorry, but Heidi Klum was a huge red flag Seal ignored back in 2004. She was pregnant and separating from the unborn child's father before the child even had a chance. Red flag. Red flag. Red flag. And a supermodel. That's another red flag. Steer clear.\n\n\"Seal 6: Commitment\" was the nadir of Seal's career. A whole album dedicated to the hollowness and shallowness of commitment to a supermodel.\n\nBut, I digress. \"Seal 7\". Amen, hallelujah, we have Seal back. Not classic, but just as good as \"System\" or \"Seal IV\". Thank goodness Trevor Horn is back on production, too. Save us all from David Foster's dreadful production values.\n\nThe good news is that \"Seal 7\" has some brilliant moments like \"Daylight Saving\", \"Padded Cell\", \"Do You Ever\" and \"Half A Heart\". These are classic Seal moments. Any of these four could be singles and hits.\n\nThen you have the second tier of quality songs like \"Every Time I'm With You\", \"Life On The Dancefloor\", \"The Big Love Has Died\", \"Let Yourself\" and \"Love\".\n\nThen, you have, what could have been b-sides: \"Redzone Killer\" and \"Monascow\". And let me just add that \"Monascow\" should never have made it out the door. That groove is ripped from Roxy Music's \"Love Is The Drug\". Couldn't Seal and Horn come up with something more original?\n\nThen, something I really hate, if you bought \"Seal 7\" at Target you got two bonus tracks that the rest of us didn't get: \"We Found Love\" and \"Whatever You Need\", which I'd love to know whether those tracks would have added or subtracted from the overall quality of the album.\n\nSo, the overall feel of \"Seal 7\" is good. There's some good songs here. \"Seal 7\" easily surpasses the last three Seal albums \"Soul 2\", \"Seal 6: Commitment\" and \"Soul\". This is at least on par with 2007's \"System\".\n\nWhat I want to hear next is Seal and Trevor Horn go back to the drawing board and re-think Seal's next musical strategy. It's time for a change. It's time to really start experimenting. It's also time that Seal thought long and hard about his lyrics and music. I believe Seal is still an untapped hit machine, much like Billy Joel or Elton John. I believe he could really get his career back on track and \"Seal 7\" was just re-establishing himself while not offering something interesting, innovative or new. Horn can be very creative as evidenced by his work with The Buggles, Art of Noise, Yes, Frankie Goes To Hollywood, ABC, Grace Jones, Pet Shop Boys, Simple Minds, Paul McCartney, Mike Oldfield, Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, Robbie Williams and Billy Idol. I don't care if it takes another five years, let's create something classic again.\n\nAs a side note, I find it hilarious that none of the lyric website have the correct lyrics for \"Padded Cell\". Seal, as is his usual practice, did not include lyrics to his songs on \"Seal 7\".\n\nHere's how \"Seal 7\" compares to the rest of Seal's work:\n\n1991 Seal: Five Stars\n1994 Seal: Five Stars\n1998 Human Being: Five Stars\n2001 Togetherland: (I guess we'll never know, will we?)\n2003 IV: Four Stars\n2007 System: Four Stars\n2008 Soul: Two and a Half Stars\n2010 Commitment: Three Stars\n2011 Soul 2: Two Stars\n2015 7: Four Stars","classification":4,"fold":8}

While Fiona often performs as a solo pianist, her previous releases have featured many well-known studio musicians in the course of her recording sessions with Windham Hill Records founder and GRAMMY winning producer Will Ackerman. However, as the title indicates, the new Fiona Joy release is primarily a solo piano recording.\n\nThe album features Fiona's original composition \"Grace\" which also appears as a large ensemble version on the \"Winds Of Samsara\" CD by Ricky Kej and Wouter Kellerman, which recently won the GRAMMY in the new age category. A track entitled \"Once Upon Impossible,\" which Fiona describes as: \"love that has tried its hardest but cannot work,\" appears in two versions on the album, one as a solo piano, and one as a duet with guitarist Lawrence Blatt, who is the sole accompanist on the album. The duet version also features Fiona's airy Enya-like vocals. One of my favorite songs was \"From The Mist,\" which draws from Fiona's Irish and Scottish roots. It is especially significant to her since it was co-written by her father.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was the emotional range and diversity that emanates from her heart and soul into her fingers as they dance on the keyboard.  Fiona's composing and piano artistry and are like a rainbow reflecting the colors of the spectrum. Each tonal shade draws the listener in to what she is feeling and expressing. But no matter what the mood, anything that Fiona plays is marked by an elegance and aesthetic that is evocative and inspiring. In her own words: \"You will hear my feelings in these songs; they are dedicated to saving that small place in everyone's heart, the place where fairytales linger, and where we find the strength to meet our reality...with grace.\"","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"All my life I've gone back and forth regarding which band I loved the most - Basie for his swinging blues or Ellington for his sophisticated compositions. This album only confuses me all the more, but also delights me.\n\nThe selections are superb, but the arrangements on this album tend to underscore Ellington's bands strengths. At least to my ears it sounds that way. But I am not complaining because the musicianship is mind boggling.\n\nI am reviewing the CD version of this album, which contains the original eight tracks. The product page for the CD - at the time of this review - does not have sound samples. For those I recommend that you go to the page for the MP3 version of the album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/First-Time-The-Count-Meets-The-Duke\/dp\/B0013DCCS6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">First Time! The Count Meets The Duke<\/a>, which not only contains representative sound samples for the original eight tracks, but an additional seven bonus tracks that were released with the reissue of this album. Those sound samples will convey more information in a few seconds of sound snippets than I can possibly describe in words. Since reviews are crosslinked between both formats you may already be on the MP3 version's page.\n\nAlthough I will not attempt to describe the music, I will point out some of the reasons I love this album. First is the piano duets that feature both the Duke and the Count. Their styles are so radically different that hearing them together is a study in contrasts that perfectly complement one another. If ever there was a musician definition of Yin and Yan this is it.\n\nAs a drummer I enjoyed picking out the contrasts between Sam Woodyard whose style made innovative use of pitch as well as rhythm, and Sonny Payne who knew how to set up each phrase in a composition and swing the band like crazy. However, as a musician, the melodic and harmonic complexities of each arrangement and the solos were a joy and a learning experience.\n\nHere is who marched into Columbia's 30th Street Studio in NYC on July 6, 1961 and made this all possible:\n\nBRASS SECTION\nTrumpet:  Cat Anderson, Willie Cook, Eddie Mullens, Ray Nance, Sonny Cohn, Lennie Johnson, Thad Jones and Snooky Young.\n\nTrombone: Juan Tizol, Louis Blackburn, Lawrence Brown, Henry Coker, Quentin Jackson and Benny Powell.\n\nREEDS AND WIND SECTION (some personnel double on instruments and will be repeated  under more than one category)\n\nClarinet: Jimmy Hamilton, Russell Procope and Marshall Royal\nAlto Sax: Johnny Hodges, Russell Procope, Marshall Royal and Frank Wess\nTenor Sax: Jimmy Hamilton, Frank Wess, Paul Gonsalves, Frank Foster and Budd Johnson\nBaritone Sax: Harry Carney and Charlie Fowlkes\nFlute: Frank Wess\n\nRHYTHM SECTION\nPiano: Duke Ellington and Count Basie\nGuitar: Freddie Green\nBass: Aaron Bell and Eddie Jones\nDrums: Sam Woodyard and Sonny Payne\n\nIf you love Ellington, Basie or both this is an album to own. I recommend the MP3 version because of the seven bonus tracks, but either way this is a slice of history that we can all be thankful that it happened.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Recently I decided to download this song on my zune player after being captivated by the sound and savoring it.  It turns out that the vocals are sung by Trace Cyrus (Miley Cyrus's older brother).  Although Trace is only 19 years old he really sings this song in a very self confident and mature way.  Admittedly this is a song that you may not want to expose to somebody that is under 13 because the song has sexual undertones to it.  The reason why I say this is because the song still has appropriate language to it but he sings about being on the bed with someone and their clothes on the floor (to his credit creatively).  He also suggests in the song how he will take someone home if he's not left at the front door.  However what makes the song great is that he sings the song creatively, self confidently, and narratively.  The reason why is say that he sings this narratively is because it sounds like he is telling a short story about charming someone he is interested in while making sure to combine the singing in seamlessly.  I agree with the others that say this is a good workout song too because the music is really  upbeat and sounds like something you can easily dance to in the club or a party.  It was also featured on one of the reality tv shows I was watching on mtv one night that features Lauren Conrad.  All in all if you are fine with songs that have a dance pop twist and you are curious to listen to how Trace Cyrus sounds then in my opinion you will like this song.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"There is no question that Barbra Streisand has been a one of a kind songstress that has delivered so well in music for over fifty years. While she has had some excellent duets over the years with Celine Dion on Tell Him, and Barry Gibb on Guilty. But when I had heard that she was going to make another duets album, bringing her heart into music again. The question is does she really deliver with her friends. Her duet with the legendary \"Piano Man\" Billy Joel and on his classic hit New York State Of Mind feels a bit weighed down and doesn't actually deliver as strong as what you had known from the classic Billy Joel song for over forty years. Here it feels like it is lackluster in vocals, and doesn't have as much of the class you would've known from the song. If you are looking forward to Partners from Barbra Streisand, you should look for something more than just a New York state of mind and voice.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"As much as I wish Max could have patched things up with his former bandmates and rejoined Sepultura long ago, I've been a fan of Soulfly since this first release.  I always hear it getting ripped on by metal fans for having a prominent nu-metal influence, or fans just dismissing it altogether as nu-metal garbage.  Going back and listening to it today, I think that's a weak criticism.  Just like the Nailbomb album, the first Soulfly has tons of super-heavy riffs that sound like a natural continuation of Sepultura's output, in this case following \"Chaos A.D.\" and \"Roots.\"  The focus is firmly on groove, but with moments of raw, hardcore speed.  Max upped the international element from \"Roots,\" with quite a few songs focused on tribal themes, using unique instruments and guest artists to create a truly distinctive style.  And yes, some hip-hop presents itself sparingly, including an unfortunate collaboration on \"Bleed\" with Fred \"The Turd\" Durst, but the track, which is a revenge song against the killers of Max's stepson, is actually one of my favorites aside from Durst's rap verse.  Even though choices like this might have showed too much emphasis on the flavor of the day, Max showed his yearning for greater musical diversity by incorporating more world music elements than on \"Roots.\"  If you're not already familiar with the album, some of the classics are \"Eye for an Eye,\" \"No Hope=No Fear,\" \"Tribe,\" and \"Prejudice,\" just to name a few highlights.  He created his own form of Brazilian Metal and, on this first release especially, really bared his soul to the world.  The self-titled Soulfy is a fantastic album that any fan of Max's work with Sepultura ought to have.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"The Honeydrippers consisted of two members of the collapsed band called Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. After Page and Plant added some new faces they had a new band, The Honeydrippers. Their new band does some great covers some of their songs. Unfortunately, this CD is rather short--and that disappoints me. What we do get, though, is excellent quality!\n\nThe track set begins with \"I Get A Thrill.\" The band gives the arrangement a big band\/swing\/50s rock and roll flavor to this number; and the band harmonizes to perfection! Listen for some great piano playing; and the drums and percussion bolster \"I Get A Thrill\" very well. Love that electric guitar, too! \"Sea Of Love\" opens with a grand musical flourish from the violins; and when the band comes in they play and sing without a superfluous note! \"Sea Of Love\" gives us The Honeydrippers delivering one of their strongest, most enchanting love ballads ever. They harmonize well as they sing this nostalgic song to celebrate the joys of being in love. The musical interlude uses the electric guitar very well, too.\n\n\"I Got A Woman\" is a song written by the late great Ray Charles; The Honeydrippers pick up the tempo to perform this song at a faster than normal clip. The tempo helps to emphasize the joyfulness of this number that has a man celebrating his love for his woman. The band delivers this flawlessly; and the horn solo during the musical interlude impresses me very much. \"Young Boy Blues\" uses some great chord changes to make this number special, too.\n\nThe CD ends with the awesome track entitled \"Rockin' At Midnight.\" If you really want to hear rock mixed with both big band and swing, listen for THIS ballad. The band celebrates being out on the town with their girlfriends; and the musical arrangement pulls out all the stops to make this number stun you with its power! The guitar solo bolsters the number as the horns play during the musical interlude; and the overall effect of \"Rockin' At Midnight\" packs a strong punch!\n\nThe liner notes include some great artwork and we get the song credits, too.\n\nThe Honeydrippers never developed to the extent I hoped they would; but this CD gives us excellent material from a band that lacked nothing. I only wish there were more than the paltry five songs on this CD! I have to take off a star because of this disappointment.\n\nOverall, you can't go wrong with this playful, energetic CD put out by The Honeydrippers. Led Zeppelin fans will at the very least be intrigued by this CD; and people who thirst for that big band sound with those crooning vocals will love this one. Pop it in your CD player and enjoy!\n\nGreat job, guys! Thank you!","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Former Hootie & The Blowfish frontman Darius Rucker reinvented himself as a Country singer, after the dismal showing of his brilliant but overlooked Neo-Soul debut \"Back To Then\". It paid off as his sophomore CD \"Learn To Love\" went on to sell over a million in the US.\n\nHis new CD \"Charleston, SC 1966\" pays homage to his hometown and year of birth, as well as his friend and biggest influence Radney Foster. It is, he says, a continuation of its predecessor but I think the songs are even catchier this time around. Opening is the upbeat Rock-tinged \"This\" with a chorus reminiscent of Hootie & The Blowfish's \"Only Wanna Be With You\". Other catchy upbeat songs are \"Might Get Lucky\", the jangly banjo\/fiddle-driven \"Love Will Do That\", and the traditional sounding \"I Don't Care\" (featuring Brad Paisley).\n\nHowever, it's the albums ballads that are a revelation; \"Come Back Song\", \"Whiskey & You\" (with quivering guitars and a nice pedal steel guitar solo), \"Southern State Of Mind\" (in which he tells us he's a well-mannered southern gentleman who holds the door open for ladies), \"Things \"I'd Never Do\", \"She's Beautiful\", \"I Got Nothing\" and the retro \"In A Big Way\". My favourite is \"We All Fall Down\", a truly spectacular ballad with powerful lyrics offering hope and redemption.\n\nWhen Rucker veered into Country, I didn't expect to like it but surprisingly I do, and his latest should see his star continue to ascend.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"I'll admit, when I saw this song was part of the soundtrack of the movie \"The Host,\" I very nearly gave it a pass.  I had liked the song when I first heard it, and somehow Weird Al's parody of it,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Inactive\/dp\/B00L6GKKOI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Inactive<\/a>, just made me want to own a copy of the original song even more.  (Singers and songwriters take note -- Weird Al is great publicity for your music.)  But when I searched for the song on Amazon I saw that there were a few versions available... including the soundtrack version.  The fact that it's connected to a Stephanie Meyer movie made me balk at first -- amazing how one inconsequential factor can still taint our enjoyment of something -- but in the end I decided to download it anyhow.\n\nDespite coming from a lackluster movie, Imagine Dragons' \"Radioactive\" is a powerful and eerie rock anthem, painting a bleak picture with its lyrics and musical accompaniment.\n\nAs one might imagine from a song with such a provocative title, \"Radioactive\" portrays a world in ruins, with the survivors \"sweating rust\" and \"breathing chemicals\" as they speak about the apocalypse and the \"new age.\"  The eerie, almost harsh electronic sounds accompanying the guitars and drums helps add to the feeling of a world rendered alien and hostile.  The lead singer's voice is nothing spectacular, but it does its job, and in the end it's the instrumentals that help carry this song, giving it a harsh but somehow hopeful tone throughout.\n\nIf you like modern rock music, give this a shot.  It's a powerful and haunting number that quite deserves its popularity.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"When it has came down to Meghan Trainor and her first album, there was a lot she brought musically to the table in her songs, and her style. She really did have some songs that really caught on with a lot of people from her Title record, and Better When I'm Dancin', which came through from The Peanuts Movie last year. But when it came down to the expectations of the music she has on her upcoming Thank You album, honestly the songs were a bit too much bitten off what she could chew. Unfortunately, when No came out, I thought it was much more of a departure from what she originally did, into the Rihanna and Beyonce' territory, and not her better points in music. The same was said for her song Watch Me Do, which also didn't ignite either. I Love Me, with LunchMoney Lewis fairs a little better, but isn't really as potent as what she had recorded before in work like Dear Future Husband and All About That Bass. Hopefully when Meghan's second album comes out, there will be much better songs coming than what she had already came out with.\n\nSong: C 1\/2-","classification":3,"fold":8}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best CDs I have in my collection and that's saying a lot--I have a fair amount of CDs! Randy Newman really blew me away with these songs and ballads that hit the nail on the head with so much social and political commentary--not to mention satire--while managing to keep the tunes catchy and easy on the ear. Randy's use of major and minor keys enhances the songs all the more, especially in stellar numbers like \"Lonely at the Top\" which discusses quite frankly the price of celebrity; \"Sail Away\" about slavery in America from the point of view of a slave trader in Africa during the time of slavery; deep thoughts about God heard in both \"He Gives Us All His Love\" and \"God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind);\" the evils of potential nuclear warfare in \"Political Science\" while pointing out that the people dropping the bombs would be too ignorant to realize that they're ruining the world instead of making it a better place; sex in \"You Can Leave Your Hat On;\" \"Memo to My Son\" which shows how an older man really doesn't know all that much about life; the memorable \"Dayton, Ohio - 1903\" and more. Several of the songs are also quite amusing such as \"Memo to My Son\" and \"Political Science.\"\n\nAnother thing I like about this edition of \"Sail Away\" is that we get some fine bonus tracks not found on the original CD release (and they certainly weren't on the original record album release, either). Listen for bonus tracks that are truly special like \"Let It Shine;\" a studio version of \"Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong;\" earlier renditions of \"Dayton, Ohio-1903\" and \"Sail Away\" as well as a demo of \"You can Leave Your Hat On.\"\n\nThis is a must-have album for any Randy Newman fan and people just discovering Randy would also do well to get this so they can enjoy it as much as I do every time I listen to it! I highly recommend this excellent album by the great Randy Newman.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"The challenge with creating unconventional songs that stray from the traditional pop song structure is finding a way to make it all musically hang together and not make it sound like a self-indulgent artsy mess only understood by high level jazz musicians and hipsters (who, of course, get everything deep). Its the struggle of a lot of electronic music, progressive soul, and scores of nu-jazz, and only the best musicians who are the most aware of the importance of audience accessibility, of melody, of smartly placed harmony, survive being acclaimed beyond that which could fill a Manhattan caf. Its a struggle that the Grammy-nominated Amel Larrieux makes look easy on the forward-thinking, new age soul of Ice Cream Everyday, what is perhaps her greatest artistic achievement since her debut solo album, Infinite Possibilities, if not better. Yes, better. This liberated from all-the-rules progressive soul confection is just that good.\n\nThis is the fifth solo album since Amel Larrieuxs famed days as the voice of 1997s Groove Theory, both the self-titled album and the duo featuring actor\/model\/producer Bryce Wilson. Leaving the near mythical group after three bonafide hits and only one album that is always mentioned with an asthmatics breathlessness, Amel Larrieux has since had three high-water marks in music as a soloist. Her first was the flawless Infinite Possibilities with Larrieuxs only Top 40 R&B solo hit, Get Up, a year 2000 album chockfull of brilliance like Sweet Misery, Searching for My Soul, and the edible bouquet ballad, Make Me Whole. The second was her 2003 duet with Glenn Lewis on the Grammy-nominated cover of the Donny Hathaway\/Roberta Flack duet, Where is the Love, featured on Stanley Clarkes 1, 2 to the Bass. The last was her undeniable 2006 release, Morning, with the utterly sublime radio single, Weary, which despite high rotation in key markets, failed to break the R&B Hot 100.\n\nStill, Infinite Possibilities stands out among them all. With nothing else like it in soul music at the time, Infinite Possibilities was everything the title said, challenging every convention of what a smooth soul or R&B album was supposed to be, incorporating every genre and winning at every turn. Of course, the label wasn't looking for artistic challenges but commercial ones and a frustrated Larrieux left to launch her own label, Blisslife, with her husband after two storied but stifling experiences with the major labels. Since, Larrieux has kept a devoted following with each indie release, equipped with stans who will stab you with an ice pick if you dare criticize the three sometimes uneven independent albums leading up to this sixteen track project that makes everything before it feel like school. Always an AP student, with Ice Cream Everyday, Amel Larrieux has now graduated magna cum laude.\n\nIce Cream Everyday does feel like having ice cream everyday. The Blisslife Records release is rich and creamy and, at times, sticky sweet in its take on love and relationships. Without question, it conquers the vexing Larrieux problem of occasionally being too meandering and ponderous at times in her previous material, projects that could sometimes be so blissful they put you right to sleep (yes, Bravebird, Im looking at you). In contrast, theres nothing dull or routine about the always moving, shifting, doing eclectic compositions that people Ice Cream Everyday. From the Prince bassline of I Do Take to the throbbing hip hop bump of You Dont See or the Teena Marie piano balladry of Dont Let Me Down, Larrieux keeps listeners on their toes. No two songs are alike and their inspired references leave only a feather light impression, ensuring each original composition is all indelibly Larrieux, both Amel and her producer husband, Laru.\n\nWith six years since 2007s Lovely Standards, the Larrieuxs inconsistent standards album, which did mightily struggle with its deconstructive efforts, Ice Cream Everyday only suffers one head-scratching moment in Trapped Being Human, which traps listeners in a sonic black hole of distorted and disturbing effects. The rest of this elastic whirlpool of moods and sounds bends genres and defies expectations, sometimes teetering toward the abyss in their freedoms, like the Middle Eastern tinged Soon, but rarely failing to be lovely to the ear. As demonstrated by the radical soul pop of Have You and the electrosoul rock of A Million Sapphires, Larrieux knows how to make nonconformity sound beautiful, but more importantly still accessible to listeners for whom the familiar feels like home.\n\nHeavenly bodies like the Spanish guitar-driven tribal house of Danger and its stripped down, string-laden ballads, Danger 2 and I Do, alone make the album worth your lunch money. Rarely has this new high priestess of electrosoul sung so hauntingly and knowingly, rising into some of the lushest self-harmonies on wax and making these secular cuts almost sacred. Cannily, she switches gears so completely from the meditative to the funky on Orange Glow and the neo-soul throwback groove of Afraid, demonstrating her versatility in a variety of sonic playscapes.  This is Amel Larrieux showing she is the complete package.\n\nWhen so many artists grow stale and expected, on her 16th year in the business and on the sixth album of her singer-songwriter career, Amel Larrieux is in her prime. On such playful musical pastiches as Ur the Shhh, Laru Larrieux has also finally come into his own as a producer, keeping a lot of loose musical idea threads wound just tight enough to keep everything joyous and compelling but open enough for Amel to play to her hearts content.

{"text":"Go Buffalo is an enjoyable song with a ringing vocal that is very listenable. The Swedish band \"Like Swimming's\" rhythm, bass line, vocal and general feeling of this song are kind of late 80's or early 90's to my ears. Somewhat reminiscent of the GoGos, the Bangles, the Cranberries or even Abba. This isn't a bad thing but does make this presentation seem a bit misplaced in time.\n\nI like \"Go Buffalo\" and it will stay in my iPod rotation for a while. If you like sound\/feel of that late 80's vibe I think you'll probably enjoy \"Like Swimming\" too.\n\nHope this helps someone!","classification":4,"fold":8}
{"text":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed eighteen sonatas for solo piano during his short lifetime. They are all contained on Mozart: Big Piano Sonatas Box, the latest Big Box album from The Bach Guild that I recently purchased. I am extremely pleased with my purchase.\n\nJeffrey Biegel, an American concert pianist, performs each of Mozarts piano sonatas with incomparable artistry. His interpretations of Mozarts music are simply exquisite in every way, and the audio quality of this MP3 album is among the best of any of the Big Box purchases I have made in the past few months.\n\nMozart: Big Piano Sonatas Box is a winner in every way. I think it ranks as one of the very best albums from The Bach Guild. At only 99 cents, this is an unbeatable bargain, and a must-own for anyone who enjoys the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Most highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":8}
{"text":"Overall this is a good album, not superb or great, but very good. INTUITION the single is excellent, and the remix CD Single is also recommended. Being at the top of the dance chart means the majority think the same way.\nThe other cuts such as \"Stand\" and \"America\" are also very good.\nFor those that think (or don't think at all), that this is a \"sudden\" change obviously have not heard 'Serve The Ego' or its remixes from about a year ago. Another dance chart topper, this album CONTINUES the trend that was already beginning on her last album. Check out the \"Serve The Ego\" mixes, those are excellent.\nI love to hear people say \"she sold out\", \"she has changed\" and other assorted basic critical comments. Does that sound familiar? Remember the Bob Dylan as he went electric? The Beatles going Sgt Pepper? Sheena Easton doing \"Strut\". Are we saying Madonna did not change???Toni Braxton? The list goes on and on. Even Nsync changed! Those who refuse to change or cannot accept change are living in the past.\nI can accept opinions of those who just don't like the music, that is fine, ok, and thats an example of how people have differing tastes, but just to say 'Sell out sell out\" to me  means  \"Grow...change..that is life\". The only acts and artists that sound the same always are at oldie shows. I applaud her willingness to try to stretch her considerable range and talent. Its still there and shows on this CD,\nThe album is good, has a few outstanding songs, 1 great song in \"Intuition\", and is a 3 to 4 star CD.  Its is not \"Hands\" or \"Pieces of You\" but is not supposed to be. I think its worth a listen, and the opinion of how good it is is yours. Do not be steered by people who do not like change. Treat it as a \"new\" sound and listen. Its your money, and the choice is yours. Like art, there is no \"absolute\" just opinions. Good Listening!","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"For some strange reason, I was compelled to eventually purchase Toxicity by System Of A Down after randomly hearing it in my head last Thursday (I then unexpectedly heard it on the radio the next day). Additionally, I saved the music video to this song in my youtube history last week after also viewing and hearing their B.Y.O. B song.  I was wondering why this song randomly popped in my head and confided to my husband about it. It turns out that he was listening to Toxicity on his itunes account a couple of days before when I was away working my overnight shift. We both listen to various types of music, with rock being one of them. The only difference is that I usually listen to rock music blended with other music genres (such as with electronica, indie rock, a type of rock rap etc) while my husband sometimes prefers harder versions of rock (such as Ramstein). I know that this may sound strange and even crazy to others, but this made sense to me (my husband listening to Toxicity while I was at work and me picking up this song in my head two days later) because I feel that both my husband and I have a strong and powerful connection due to being kindred spirits and getting to know each other the longer we have been married (Im happy and thankful to report that we have been married for 10. 5 years now). I do not fully understand the lyrics, but I admit to enjoying this song due to the compelling singing and the way that the music instruments complement the timing of the song.  As for my husband, he enjoys Toxicity by System Of A Down because he sees it as a hard rock motivational type of track.","classification":5,"fold":8}
{"text":"Like many people, my first encounter with the 'music' of this young man followed a conviction for violence against a woman. Little surprise then, that this album if packed full of explicit references and veiled pornographic imagery - yet aimed squarely at kids and teenagers. The song 'wet the bed' is downright appalling.  A sad indictment of the current state of the music industry that the worlds most famous record label RCA, allowed this to be released.\n\nIn June 2010, Chris Brown's application for a visa to enter the UK was refused on the grounds of him \"being guilty of a serious criminal offence\". This followed criminal convictions that included a violent assault on a female pop star. Brown got lucky and was sentenced to five years of probation, one year of domestic violence counselling, and six months of community service; the judge retained a five-year restraining order on Brown, which requires him to remain 50 yards away from [the victim] Rihanna, 10 yards at public events.\n\nIt is with the above publicity that I learn about this 'singer' and I spend several hours sampling the album - trying to find out what the fascination is.\n\nThis individual sounds like a third rate karaoke version of a young Michael Jackson. This is 'painting by numbers' music. The tracks sound like they are straight off a studio factory assembly line. Unimaginative and repetitive references to 'make you love me' and 'i'm gonna do x,y,z to you' this is not music I would allow children to come within a mile of.\n\nMore mature artists perform this genre with a level of authenticity. This just sounds very young & amateurish.\n\nThe track 'Next To You' proves that Brown has some singing ability. How edited the track is, I do not know, but he can clearly sing. It only proves how utterly murky the whole situation is. Underneath the anger, the violence, the bad influences, there is probably a talented young man. Possibly, but I doubt there is enough talent to save this sorry character from a further life of crime.","classification":1,"fold":8}

But after he passed away, his songs had some really dear value in the heart. But some of the songs that have been released after his death just don't actually deliver as strong as he was here. A Place With No Name, the third single from the posthumous Xscape record takes a page on a sample on the classic America song A Horse With No Name. The song has some of the drive that Jackson would've been known for at heart. The song was originally planned for his Invincible album, but either way it just isn't as strong as some of Michael's other songs that have had samples like You Rock My World. If you are a hard core fan of Jackson's, you'll want this one but otherwise you would want to go somewhere else.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"Bravo Keyshia! I'm a fan who doesn't consider this album a \"comeback\" because although CALLING ALL HEARTS is a solid album I believe poor single choices more than anything hurt its momentum.  This album is excellent from start to finish & features Keyshia's trademark soulful vocals over contemporary r&b beats. The theme of the album goes back to what Keyshia's fans claim they appreciate most about her - heartbreak and challenging a lover to \"act right or step off\", there are also a few tracks that seem inspired by her husband which makes for a balanced album covering all sides of a relationship.\n\nFrom the moment I heard her lead single, ENOUGH OF NO LOVE I got hyped about this album - this song is a great lead off featuring her strong lyrics & vocals about being tired of a cheating lover and a laid back assist from Lil Wayne.  The 2nd single, TRUST & BELIEVE is a smoker - I love the drum intro that tricked me into thinking this was an uptempo track instead of a searing ballad.  The other tracks that stand out to me are:\n\nZERO f\/ Meek Mill - I'm not familiar with this rapper but he lends the male perspective to the song and what's great is his verses actually have something to do with the \"story\" of the song;\n\nI CHOOSE YOU - WOW! was my first impression.  Keyshia is singing her heart out on the chorus and I love it;\n\nFOREVER - although I felt the profanity was pointless, I like this track as it seems to be about her husband;\n\nWHO'S GONNA HOLD ME DOWN - love the Isaac Hayes sample & her spoken word intro;\n\nWOMAN TO WOMAN f\/ Ashanti - love the fact that they collabo'd & appreciate the mature lyrics between two women involved with a cheating man;\n\nNEXT MOVE f\/ Robin Thicke - this isn't a true duet, Robin provides backing vocals that complement Keyshia's very well & the production of this track is beautiful.\n\nThe following tracks are enjoyable to listen to but to me aren't as strong as the previous ones:  SIGNATURE - stripped down arrangement, sweet lyrics about her love for her husband & how he's changed her life, this is a really nice way to end the disc; MISSING ME - the arrangement of the song allows Keyshia's vocals to shine; GET IT RIGHT - the arrangement is melodic but the track itself is just \"ok\"; WHY LIE - the arrangement is stripped down & has a vague reggae vibe which is pleasant and doesn't overtake the track; WONDERLAND f\/ Elijah Blake - duet with great lyrics about being with someone you love.\n\nOne track I'm sort of iffy about is STUBBORN - although I love the parts of the song when she's singing softly & leads up to the chorus but when she gets to the chorus, the music gets louder and it seems like she's almost shouting to be heard over the music.  It's not totally unpleasant to listen to but it's taking me a while to warm up to this track.\n\nFinally the only track that I dislike is: HEY SEXY - the use of that annoying baby voice saying \"I know you're not not gonna sing that song\" is ANNOYING!  If it'd only been used during the song intro that would've been enough but it's peppered throughout the song and really ruins the flow of the song which isn't bad otherwise.\n\nOn a superficial note - I love the cover & album art as Keyshia is photographed as she was styled during each album release which allows fans to reminisce about her growth from a young unknown artist on her debut album, THE WAY IT IS to the confident woman on this, her 5th album. I must also applaud Keyshia for staying true to who she is as an artist - she didn't go overboard with mixing hip hop elements and didn't hop on the euro-pop\/dance bandwagon as others have, this is a straight up enjoyable r&b album and I hope that her label supports at least 2 more singles from the album to help it grow.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"The reunion of the \"very tall band\" whet my appetite for the first meeting.  Musically, it doesn't disappoint.  From the very first track, \"On Green Dolphin Street,\" Oscar plays with uncommon yet swinging economy and restraint, drawing the listener in as on few other recordings (he's clearly showing the influence of both Bill Basie and John Lewis).  And when he does finally explode with a torrent of notes, he's neither intrusive nor overwhelming.  In fact, he's all but perfect as a complementary and solo voice on this remarkable session.  And Bags is, as usual, the master of bop and blues, a peerless player of the instrument when it comes to playing a vibraharp with two mallets (Gary Burton would cut the rotators, add two more mallets, and take the instrument in a different direction).  As recently as 5 years earlier, Milt was still playing with fast-spinning rotators, but by the time of this session his distinctive sound is firmly in place.  (To a previous reviewer who made reference to the MJQ, if you really want to hear the MJQ minus John Lewis, check out \"Bags and Trane.\")\n\nOne caveat: the audio on this most recent edition is a disappointment.  Apparently Verve was enamored of the novelty of \"stereophonic sound\" at the time of recording because the separation is so extreme the principals could be playing in separate rooms.  Oscar's piano sound is squeezed and even slightly distorted; Ed Thigpen's drums lack dispersion and upper-register presence. In fact, there's a slightly \"canned\" quality to the overall sound, making you want to take the lid off.  I have a hunch that if Verve sensed a sufficient market for this recording, they could do wonders by it in terms of refreshing the sound.  (Sometimes it's worth paying a premium for a Japanese or Spanish import.  Other countries are more likely to view the project of restoration as worth the time and money.)","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"\"Black and Blue\" might not be to the taste of rockers who expect every Stones album to trot out another \"If You Can't Rock Me\" or \"Rocks Off\", but I've always found it to be a refreshing change. Listen to the samples, you'll see what I mean. The samples don't do justice to every song here but you'll get an idea of this album's groove. Song for song I prefer it over \"Goats Head Soup\" or \"It's Only Rock & Roll\" (although both of those do have a number of Stones classics). And \"Some Girls\", half its album cuts sound boilerplate thirty years on, but of the eight songs on \"Black and Blue\", the only throwaway would be \"Crazy Mama\".\n\nThe track most frequently included on my car CD compilations is the funky workout \"Hey Negrita\", with \"Hot Stuff\" a close runner-up. It's worth noting that most collections (like \"40 Licks\" or whatever it was called) include the edited single versions of \"Hot Stuff\" and \"Fool to Cry\". \"Melody\" is another favorite, distinctive within the Stones' catalog, a good song for hanging out with friends late at night. Years later UB40 would also cover \"Cherry Oh Baby\", but listen and compare, see if you don't agree that the Stones version is far better.\n\nIf you've picked up a few Stones albums and you're at risk of tiring of their sound or you think you have what you need already, try \"Black and Blue\" on for size. After the four albums that are the pinnacle of their career - Exile, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Beggars Banquet - this would be the next one on my list.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"\"That girl took that song away from me.\" It was the summer of 1967. Otis Redding was in the midst of the performance of his life at the Monterey International Pop Festival. What he was referring to of course was the way Aretha Franklin had turned his song \"Respect\" into one of the biggest hits of the year. His version topped out at #35 on the pop charts a couple of years earlier. But I digress. Otis Redding was just beginning to hit his stride as summer turned to autumn in 1967. This veteran performer had been around for a while. The fact is that up until this point he had made the Billboard Hot 100 a total of 19 times although his records usually ran out of gas somewhere in the middle of the chart. His tunes fared much better on the Soul\/R&B charts where 8 of them had made it into the Top Ten. It is really difficult to understand why the man had not had greater commercial success up until this point. After taking a few months off Otis Redding returned to the studio in early December 1967. There he recorded a song he had co-written with Steve Cropper. Everyone thought it was a mistake. His wife hated it. Three days later Otis Redding was dead at 26, a victim of a tragic plane crash in Wisconsin.\n\nWhen the story appeared in the newspaper I remember thinking to myself \"Who is that?\" And although I had been collecting records for about three years I had never heard of him. Despite his enormous talent Otis Redding had just not quite connected with general audiences. Less than two months later in January of 1968, Volt records released that tune his wife and friends hated so much. \"(Sitting On) The Dock of the Bay\" went all the way to #1 on the Pop charts and remained there for a month. Everyone now finally realized just how talented this man had been.  An American classic.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"See with Jaheim, ive noticed the man can not make bad music. Every album he has put out has been at least good, and excellent at his best. And that continues with Makings of A Man. I think Ja made a good choice in switching record labels and going to Atlantic, because at Warner he wasn't getting any promotion. This was the first time i had to go to 2 different stores to find the damn album, because they were sold out at the first store. Jaheim is a breath of fresh air in the state of R&B right now. Because most of the R&B being put out right now revolves around Sex, partying, and drugs. And some of that is ok in small doses but to make a whole album around that gets old real fast. But Ja knows how to balance his albums between Love & Sex. He doesnt over do it on this album, along with any of his other albums. But the biggest thing that i think helped him in the move to Atlantic, was that it introduced him to some new and better producers. This is the first time a Ja album has actually had a more contempary feel to it. Like the stellar Babyface written \"Just Don't Get It\", this is totally different than the Ja we are used to. This song totally sounds like it could be on the radio. Excellent track. Like on the R. Kelly produced \"Hush\" where Ja reminices about how he had an affair with his best friends girl. This album is alot different sounding than his previous albums, but its a good thing. While \"Never\" could possibly be played at weddings, he can still do songs that the thugs can feel to like \"Life of a Thug\". And the other thing that i really like about this album (This might sound weird), is that he released it in December. Which in my opinion is the perfect time for him to release an album because in winter, i always find myself listening to his albums. I don't know what it is but during the winter his music just does it for me when i am driving around. Not that during the summer or whatever i don't like him, but during the winter i always make sure to have at least one of his albums in the car with me at all times. I think it could be his just smooth but jagged vocals that just warms the air during the winter that makes his music so attractive during the winter season. And we all know Ja can blow, unless you are new to Ja, now is the perfect time to introduce yourself. And this album will be in heavy rotation for quite some time because it is just as good as his previous albums, if not better. Another hit for Jaheim... as usual!\n\nGrade:\nB+","classification":4,"fold":8}

A viable Southern hustling emcee of yesteryear, Paul Wall has made contributions to hip-hop through his records with the Swishahouse label and most recently with Paul Wall Music. Wall's seventh LP, The Po-Up Poet, is more material of Wall's archetypal style, filled with notions of weed, money, cars, ladies, jewelry and lots of \"drank.\" Never one to blow minds with advanced lyricism, Paul Wall has historically received regards for his raps of steady rhyming, and this same modus operandi is applied faithfully by Wall in Po-Up. He is still that same on-the-grind hustler with expensive tastes, focused on staying on his toes and having fun in between time. Worthy of notable mention are the tracks \"No Favors,\" a lesson in self-reliance, and \"Codeine Heartbreak,\" where Wall discusses his love\/hate relationship with extra strength, prescription cough syrup. The guest line-up is predictable, offering up verses of Dirty South flavor, especially from Screwed Up Click rapper Z-Ro, who appears twice on the album. The electronic trap beats match all of Wall's objectives and while formulaic, they are just original enough to be tolerable. At this point in Wall's career, The Po-Up Poet is a subpar effort, only attractive to die hard Paul Wall obsessives.","classification":1,"fold":8}

Reaching adolescence in the late 1990s, and preparing for the then-upcoming release of \"Human Being\", bought both self-titled albums and I loved both of them and they are now among my favorite albums of the last 25 years. 1998's \"Human Being\" though was a very challenging record as it went from the gray ambience of the first LP to the mix of sun and gray of the second LP, to a wintry evening trancey feel but it has become another great album. Though years would pass which saw an entire album scrapped, his 2003 self-titled album \"Seal IV\" was more or less a return to the style of the first two LPs but with a lighter, and somewhat heavier R&B influence, closer to almost Marvin Gaye-esque feel. 2007's \"System\" was a great dance record. And then there were the \"Soul\" records and then \"Seal 6: Commitment\" which I thought was his best musically since his early LPs.\n\n Now with Seal 7, his streak of great albums continues with his latest album.\n\n \"Life On The Dance\" floor is the winner as it is a marvelous, high-energy dance song that blends the best of dance music, R&B, funk, and pop all wrapped into a very moving rhythm and great production quality.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Lucinda's voice and guitar playing are so soothing  Are You Alright is my favorite of the bunch.  This is an excellent song about being concerned about a special friend in need.  The track Words is another highlight on this disc.  This is a great song about the power of  writing.  Words can truly comfort a person who is lonely, and I truly believe this.  What If is a beautiful song about the dream of peace in the world.  I could visualize the  vivid images in the song while listening to it.  Fancy Funeral is another gem on this album.  This is a very solemn song about how money does not matter when someone dies.  Learning How To Live is a song about learning how to move on after breaking up with someone.  The lyrics in the song are very meaningful to me.  Lucinda gets help with some talented musicians on this CD.  Come On is a track about feeling frustrated in a relationship.  Doug Pettibone gives this song a nice edge playing the electric guitar here.  Jim Keltner provides a sexy deep drum beat on the track Wrap My Head Around That.

{"text":"Anyone who loves the Monkees already knows the backstory. And I do not care if you are still calling the Monkees the pre-fab four, I still consider them an extrememly influential band who still rocks today (though sadly Davy passed away this past year). Aside from the first two albums where there input was minimal (vocals mainly)..and this wasn't by their choosing but by the powers that be, the Monkees have put out a ton of great music in a short period of time. And their reuninion albums are also great (Pool it, and Justus). That being said, my favorite Monkee has always been Micky Dolenz, both as a vocalist and as a star in the show. He was the funniest and the most soulful. I agree with one person who said that the reason he loved Micky is because as an actor turned singer, he brought an element of acting into the recording studio. That explains why the ballads and the rockers had equal part emotion and theatrics. You always felt as if he was the person in the songs he sang, even though you are supposed to seperate the two. I have always wished he had released more solo cds in the past, but well I can't change what he didn't do I can only enjoy the things he did do.\n\nHis last CD (King for a day) was thematic and full of the things that make Micky so great. He paid tribute to one of the Monkees songwriters by redoing his classic Monkees songs along with songs she had written outside of the Monkees. And that worked really really well.\n\nThis cd is a bit of the same in the sense that he does redo the classic Monkees songs, along with other non-monkees songs. Only this time each song has a little story behind it. Rather than a unifying theme each song has had some story that relates it to his life. Randy Scouse Git is a song we know as one he wrote back in the day, and he gives it more or less a layla-like update. the Song Do Not Ask for Love Once More\" is one of my all time favorites. And this time he's given it a more acapella sound. Great harmonizing (with himself) and a great performance overall. And i'm a Believer is a great re-interpretation as well. Anyone looking for a straight forward remake will be sadly disappointed, anyone who is looking to hear the Great Micky Dolenz do what he does best, will be in for a treat.\n\nThe choice to slow down Johnny B. Goode sounds like a bad idea, but then again he's past the age where he needs to show he can rock out. He would sound silly trying to redo it in the old Chuck Berry style. Also \"Many Years\" sounds great too, though I've never heard the song before in my life, I find the layering of Micky's vocals to be an added bonus on most of these songs. They used to overlay their songs with multiple voices from the band, now he's doing it with just his vocals. And it works great. Also the song \"Sugar Sugar\" is a nice treat as well especially given the history of the song, and how it was offered to the Monkees (who refused it on the grounds they only wanted to record songs that spoke to them at the time) it instead went to the fictional band, the Archies.\n\nthe packaging is the stupid digipak packaging. Anyone who knows me knows I hate this. CD cases do not need to be ecologically friendly as I am not going to ever throw them away. It seems stupid and unnecessary to put them in these packages. But I can't bring the stars down based solely on this. I just wish record labels would stop this and take care of the people who are buying these items and not worry about saving just a penny or two.\n\nThe insert is missing lyrics (and I am a big proponent of including lyrics even in Greatest Hits packaging) but again, I can't take down the stars because of this. It's more of a personal gripe. But, I will add, that the insert does offer some great information. As I stated before each song has a story behind it, and in the booklet he tells us a story for each song. It also includes some notes from the producer as well as the guitarist etc, who commented how great it was to work with Micky. But it's probably the stories behind each track that will keep you interested.\n\nOverall this album isn't for everyone, anyone who wants him to redo Monkees songs (without changing the arrangements etc) should by the greatest hits albums or the orginal albums, but if someone wants to see the evolution of an artists, then this is a must have. It's another side of Micky, and something you won't want to miss out on. Some of these songs are not Monkees songs either like \"An Old Fashioned Love Song\" which Micky turned down in 1970 and 3 dog Night actually got to record..because he took too long to decide to do it. (though in hindsight the 1970's Micky would have sounded awesome doing it the original way as well. but he doesn't disappoint with this rendition either. This CD does boast one original Micky song \"Quiet Desperation\" as well as a remake of a Beatle's Song \" Good Morning, Good Morning\" which many will remember was a song Micky used in the only episode he directed (and cowrote) the Frodis Caper (also the last episode of the series).\n\nSo my advice to you is not to pass this up. Micky needs to have more solo stuff, Mike did a great job releasing albums over the years, it's a shame Micky hasn't too. And I wish he'd write more songs too. I think he doesn't feel as confident with his own material but he really is a great songwriter too. So if you want good music, from an artist who still sounds great and fresh, then pick this up. And hopefully you will love it as much as I do.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"UPDATE:  Everything below is true.  At the time, Amazon was changing their download procedure, and it was seriously effed-up.  I have no apologies for my frustration at the time.  Fortunately, Amazon has fixed the download situation.  Now when you buy a collection, every track automatically goes to the cloud, and one simple button will download all those tracks from the cloud to your PC.\n\nThe collection itself is not perfect, but it's pretty darned good for 99.  Sadly, despite many customer comments about the missing Composer information, in the seven months since the original release, Amazon has not bothered to solve THAT problem.  If they had added the Composer info, I would have upgraded my original 1-star rating to 4 or 5 stars.  Since Amazon hasn't done that, I'll give them 3 stars for \"good music but serious lack of attention to details.\"\n\n-------------\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS:\n\nWhen I clicked the \"Download\" link, I got some sort of Java error message.  I wasn't able to download the files.\n\nAfter spending a lot of time searching for a way to contact Amazon to fix the problem, I finally reached a CSA who told me that it is no longer possible to download the files directly!  I need to go to \"the cloud\" and \"enable\" my computer somehow to get the files there.  NOT what I have done in the past and NOT what I want to do in the future.\n\nThe CSA, however, said she would give me a \"secret link\" of some sort, that would let me download the files this one time.  Nice thought, but the \"secret link\" didn't work right.  In the end, I had to download the files individually... all 300 of them!\n\nThat's right, there was no link that would automatically download the entire collection.  I had to scroll down the list of 300 files, and click \"download\" 300 times.  And I could only download one at a time.  I could not start downloading a second file while the first one was downloading.  It took well over two hours!!!\n\nThis is a giant Pain In The Amazon, and I will certainly never buy another collection if I have to go through this s*** to download my files.","classification":3,"fold":8}

I hear on youtube a lot and in real life sometimes that, \"this song makes you think about your life...\" and \"it makes me want to change and never take anything for granted.\"\n\nnow that's soul. when it touches you deep, deep down and won't let go.\n\nfor all those living under a rock, this song is about loving someone like it's the last time you'll see them. a great thing to say, but how many of us will actually and actively do this? follow through?\n\nnot enough. and that's ok! it's the human condition to take for granted things in your life, daily; friends, lovers, family, mothers, dogs and cats; hell, even ex's!\n\nbut this song is about looking at what things mean to you and what's most important. it's like a lullaby w\/ a back beat! just listen to the production. i can listen to it all day and i really don't get tired of it much. alicia has helped produce a bunch of bangers; girlfriend, how come you don't call me, mr. man (2001), you don't know my name, diary, slow down, if i ain't got you, samsonite man, nobody not really, the interlude (on the album) (2003), unbreakable, every little bit hurts (2005) and finally, no one, superwoman, sure looks good to me, the thing about love, lessons learned and finally, this masterpiece. it's definitely her best track yet and i don't see her getting much better than now. but has any of her main albums ever disappointed? hardly, for the fans!\n\n6.25 stars.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"The whole album \"John Barleycorn Must Die\" by Traffic is an amazing album.  It does not have a single bad or even mediocre track. For me the title tune stands out. Even after all the decades it still fires an emotional response and does not get old.\n\nThe song itself an old folk song which is anti-prohibition and as performed by Traffic is a little sorrowful sounding to me. Almost as if sung in mourning. In the end we know that prohibition ended as the song predicts with \"and little Sir John with his nut brown bowl proved the strongest man at last\"\n\nBack in the days when this came out I was in a local band playing guitar. Traffic was one of those influential sources that inspired us and became part of the soundtrack of that portion of my life.\n\nJohn Barleycorn Must Die is a classic song with an iconic performance that has stood up well for at least 47 years so far. Such was the magic of Traffic in their prime. Without question 5 stars from Traffic","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"A little more than two years after she released her sophomore album, Foxy Brown returns with a world of experiences to talk about on BROKEN SILENCE. This album is a testament to the life the hip-hop femme fatale has lived, and it's her most truthful work to date. From the vagaries of love to life's struggles to the business of music, Brown completely opens up, detailing every last secret that has haunted her career.\nOn \"A Letter,\" she dedicates a verse to her mother and each of her brothers, apologizing for her mistakes. Then on \"730,\" a bouncy track produced by Loafey, Foxy speaks directly to another woman who's trying to rain on her parade. But that doesn't mean that the entire album is about heartache, as reggae-influenced songs like \"Tables Will Turn,\" featuring Baby Cham, and \"Oh Yeah,\" featuring Spragga Benz, introduce a new wrinkle to Brown's rapping style. She also honors her roots by paying homage to her hometown Brooklyn on \"BK Anthem.\"","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Bach Guild's efforts to offer their back catalogue with an ever growing list of \"Big\", \"Little\" and \"Big Little\" Boxes at bargain prices must be applauded by music lovers. Not only do we get some rare performances by great artists, but we also get music that most of us would find unfamiliar. Amazon offer a range of bargain compilations, frequently by lesser-known artists - often from Eastern Europe - and some from artists who hide behind false names. These Big Boxes contain real musicians who were often leaders in their field, and, like this one, were ground breakers in the performance of \"early\" music.\nThe \"Big Purcell Box\" contains some great recordings by such artists: George Malcolm, Nicholas Harnoncourt, Alfred Deller and  Neville Marriner to name a few. Like some of the other Bach Guild releases there are some repeats, the Abdelazar Suite (from which Britten took his theme for \"The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra\", notably appearing for the third time in a Bach Guild release, the Hartford Orchestra again offering \" The Gordian Knot\", \"The Virtuous Wife\" and \"The Married Beau\", as well as George Malcolm's \"Musick's Handmaid\" in repeats of releases in the Big Baroque Box.\nThat being said these are minor points to accompany a very fine release that represents much of Bach Guild\/Vanguard's efforts in the 60s and 70s in recording this music. Of course, the album has only just been released as I write so I have not yet had the chance to listen through all 219 tracks. I already know the previously released music so am aware that the repeated performances by Harnoncourt, Malcolm, Deller and the Hartford  Orchestra are excellent.\nThe album starts with music from \"The Fairy Queen\", played lightly and precisely by Harnoncourt and the Concentus Musicus Wien (there's a little jump in track 2 which should be fixed). Alfred Deller was one a leader in the resurrection of early music on the British Music Scene and has been well represented in other Bach Guild editions especially in collaboration with the great Gustav Leonhardt. His countertenor voice now sounds a little old fashioned and, for some, hard to get used to. However, here he leads a performance of  \"Come ye Son's of Art\", \"My Beloved Spake\" and \"Rejoice in the Lord alway\", \"Welcome to all the Pleasures\" sings a couple of songs from \"The Faerie Queen\" , the Cantata \"Ever More Riches\" and a complete \"Dido and Aeneas\" that are welcome additions to my collection, along with his solo songs recorded with Walter Bergmann. His direction of soloists and orchestra on the larger pieces show him to have been a master of exquisite detail. Soloists like Robert Tear, April Cantelo, Gerald English and Maurice Bevan were top singers on the British music scene in the 60s and 70s and shine in these performances.\n\nThe \"Dioclesan\" music - the Choral Masque and the instrumental incidental music is a centrepiece of the album with brisk playing and singing from the Deller\/Harnoncourt combination - a real treat!!\n\nHarnoncourt's small group viol  work is lovely, as are George Malcolm's ensembles with Despond Dupre, Peter Gibbs and Granville Jones.\nNowadays some of these performance might seem a little staid (The Hartford\/Mahler I find unadventurous, and the Vienna rather dated in sound in performance, and some of the singing a little warbly) but all in all this is a stellar collection  of the work of whom some might say was England's greatest composer.\nOne final positive - apart from the composer name (of course not necessary, and easily added) the metadata for all these tracks are present and (presumably) accurate. A triumph for the Bach Guild \/ Amazon partnership!!","classification":5,"fold":8}

Hearing it now helps me remember those heady feelings and give me a 3 minute escape on a Love Song Magic Carpet to a simpler time.\n\nBread provided music of the 70's that was approachable to a wider audience. While many hard rock fans dismissed them, a few decades on I appreciate them more than when they were performing. I appreciate how much they meant to friends and family just a bit older than me too.\n\nI'm glad I gave them another look. It was well worth it and :\"Make it with You\" is well worth 5 stars to me.\n\nHope this helps someone!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Honestly, having been forced to hear this a number of times, my best friend and I thought it best to go somewhere where we were sure we we not going to hear it. We went to our favorite retro-style, dive bar where a lot of classic rock enthusiasts, metalheads (of which I am one), and even hipsters like to hang out and have a few casual drinks, and also where tracks (not songs) like this atrocity are highly condemned. Not only that, but there was a dance-floor oriented, rave-type bar right next store, so there was NO EXCUSE for a few certain people who came in and decided they were going to ruin it for everyone by playing this vile piece of trash on the jukebox.\n\nMy goodness, why do people actually like this vile, disgusting, putrid, non-artistic trash? It is complete, over-the-top noise pollution enjoyed only by classless people who like to \"get down and dirty\" after getting wasted out of their minds. It turns guys into pigs and girls into sluts, and that is a fact! This kind of garbage is what is destroying society, no questions asked. There is not one shred of musical worth in this 3 1\/2 minute piece of steaming, vile disgusting, gross and despicable abomination of a \"song\" whatsoever. If giving this track NEGATIVE 1,000,000 stars was an option, I'd slap it with that in a heartbeat.\n\nAlso, people have actually played stuff like Tupac, Beastie Boys, Big L, B.I.G. and Run DMC at this same bar, and I never minded that at all, so I am by no means biased against hip hop as a whole, despite not being a fan.","classification":1,"fold":8}

{"text":"I should say upfront that I am a Tangerine Dream of the old days, the Virgin releases era really (1973-1983), and I lost interest in the band pretty much in the late 1980s. Couldn't stand the band's eventual drift into new age, mixes, and whatever else. But when I read about this album, I was intrigued, and so on a whim really, sound unheard, I purchased this from Amazon recently. I must add that I'm into another phase of being into electronic music from watching the excellent \"Kraftwerk and the Electronic Revolution\" DVD, which explores the German music scene in the 70s, including of course Kraftwerk, but also Klaus Schulze, Cluster, Harmonia, and Tangerine Dream, among others.\n\n\"Booster\" (2 CDs, 16 tracks, 114 min.) is a curious mix. I was immediately skeptical when I read the liner notes, which tell us \"Some titles have been exclusively compiled 2007 from various Tangerine Dream releases\", and then that only a couple of tracks (3 in fact) are unreleased. After a tentative opener \"One Night In Space\" though, I am very charmed by the 14+ min. \"Hyper Sphinx\", which reminds me of latter 80s Tangerine Dream, nicely done. The re-recording of classic tracks \"Logos\" and \"Tangram\" are worthless, as they only want to make you want to listen to the original tracks. But there are several other highlights, none better than the 14+ min set closer \"Bells of Acra\", which I really like.\n\nIt is surely not a coincidence that I liked the 2 longest tracks on here by far. That said, this is not the return of the Tangerine Dream of old, but it surely is the best new music I've heard from Edgar Froese in, well, forever. Is it 'essential' to have? no, but it's decent enough.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"There are apparently quite a few versions of this song available to purveyors of worship music.  The original is almost nine minutes long and much more minimalistic.  I tend to like driving percussion and this particular version makes very good use of it, so even though this is a remix of sorts, IMHO it is one of the better versions of this song, which is probably why they made it the \"Radio Version.\"","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"This is really a great album with a deep spiritual message. It's probably the best stuff he's done in my opinion. I love all the godsmack albums but they lacked that spiritual and contemplative depth. This album has the wisdom of some of the Pearl jam or tool albums which is hard to find. The song structures are different on this one, some 8 minutes long and a lot of tribal sounding instruments and strings are used. It doesn't have as much of the heavy metal sound that godsmack has. I wish godsmack would have evolved in this direction rather that holding on to that old sound, holding on to the shallowness of youth. Sully has a lot of deep thoughts and a humble soul, he's just hidden it from godsmack!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Fly from Here the new album by Yes is a masterpiece! The album itself has a timeless quality about it, and is a pleasure to listen to.\nTrevor Horn ex-lead singer for Yes is once again with the band as strictly a producer\/cowriter, and the product is brilliant.\nNote: (Trevor Horn replaced Jon Anderson as lead vocalists in the band for the Drama album exclusively, as well as the tour in support of the album).\n This release also marks the debut of Benot David the new lead singer for Yes, and I have to say I am extremely impressed with his vocals. David appears to sometimes sound a bit like Anderson, but more like Horn, so much so that at times one might think they were listening to something from Drama that was never released. That in fact is not far from the truth, as the title track \"Fly from Here\" an epic six part piece is based on a demo from 1980 entitled \"We Can Fly from Here\". Having expanded the demo track into the epic it now is was a fantastic idea, and it works mainly due to Benot David's vocal similarity to Trevor Horn. The other five tracks are primarily stand-alone tunes and are beautifully written and performed by the band as a whole. Rejoining Yes for Fly from Here is yet another member of the band from the Drama album, on keyboards completely outdoing himself is Geoff Downes, and Geoff is at the top of his game, and is refreshing to hear performing at his progressive rock peak. Longtime Yes members Chris Squire , Alan White, and Steve Howe are also in rare form, especially throughout the six part \"Fly from Here\".\nThis album signifies a new beginning for Yes, and brings us some closure from the days of Drama (one of my favorite albums), as well as opening the future for the band building on the Drama sound and taking it to an entirely new level. Fly from Here in many ways is the follow-up to Drama ,that we as Yes fans never got, and although many fans may refuse to accept any other singer then Jon Anderson, get over it! Change can be a good thing, and in the case of Fly from Here an exceptional musical experience!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Las Vegas-based indie rock released this stuff in 2012, which marks their official debut in the music industry. Although not very well-known up to now, the Dragons, led by lead guitarist and vocalist Dan Reynolds, prove that they got a lot of talent, both lyrically and musically. The best proof of it is this album Night Visions, which opens with the electronic-tinged, slow-paced Radioactive, followed up with the poppy Tiptoe, It`s Time (one of the recognizable singles on this album), Demons, on which Reynolds` voice sounds similar to that of Coldplay`s Chris Martin, the catchy On The Top of The World, Amsterdam (Promotional track, previously released on the EP It`s Time) and Hear Me., which shares some similar melodies to that of Amsterdam). The rest of this disc ranges from melodical to upbeat tracks that are also worth checking out: Every Night, Bleeding Out, Underdog, Nothing Left To Say, Working Man, Fallen and My Fault. Overall, Night Visions is a great start for Imagine Dragons. Let`s hope to see more good stuff from them.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Blue Merle's debut CD has some very good things going for it.  The band's sound is kind of mellow folk-country-pop that has an appeal.  Lead singer Luke Reynolds has an expressive moan in his voice that communicates longing, sadness and desire.  The great weakness of the disc is that the tracks blend facelessly into each other without any jumping out as truly memorable.  Their sound is impressionistic with emphasis on atmosphere and mood, a wonderful rainy day disc.  \"Every Ship Must Sail Away\" is a good example of the aching groove in which the band revels, \"Cause years pass & people change; the bluest skies can turn to grey.\"  \"Boxcar Racer\" has a nice jazz groove and a distinguishable melody & is one of the better tracks.  \"Either Way It Goes\" also gets a bit of energy, \"I didn't mean to let you down, but sometimes even angels hit the ground.\"  Ultimately, Blue Merle show promise and have a nice sound, but now they need to hone their songwriting skills to make tracks that stick in the memory.  Enjoy!","classification":3,"fold":8}

{"text":"THE BAND: James Hetfield (lead vocals, rhythm guitars), Kirk Hammett (lead guitars), Cliff Burton (bass guitars), Lars Ulrich (drums & percussion).\n\nTHE DISC: (1984) 8 songs clocking in at approximately 47 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page booklet with black & white band pictures, song credits\/lyrics and thank you's. All music written by Metallica. Recorded at Sweet Silence Studios, in Copenhagen, Denmark. Label - Elecktra.\n\nCOMMENTS: I grew up with this album. Played the vinyl record in college so many times I wore it out (thank God for compact discs). This is still a classic Metallica album. However, decades later, I go back and forth with \"Ride The Lightning\". Thinking it totally shreds one week, and then the next week thinking it's so hard to get into. This album takes an acquired taste, and perhaps 'mood' is the better word. \"Lightning\" is Metallica finding their roots. Sure 6 of the 8 tracks are fragments of brilliance; atom splitting; rapid-fire assaults on the senses. The lightning quick songs are important in the band's library of songs. They had to go through these early stages to get to where they are today - so many years later. The title track is perhaps my favorite fast track on the album. The two slower songs - \"For Whom The Bells Toll\" and \"Fade To Black\" - are perhaps two of the best songs in the entire Metallica catalog. I can still listen to these songs anywhere, any time, any day. Both feature some amazing guitar work (both electric and acoustic). \"Call Of Ktulu\" is a 9 minute instrumental slugfest that I fell in love again with after their 'live' version on \"S&M\" simply blew me away. Decades after this release, it's still a classic in my book, but I have to be in the mood for it. Just a notch below \"Master Of Puppets\". Still a great disc.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"The heavily-promoted and massive Time-Life \"mail order only\" series of CDs of about 18-23 years ago constantly reminded you that \"you can't get these in any store\" and seemed intent, at the time, to corner the market on everything from the Big Band Era to Pop, Country, R&B, Soul and R&R. In addition to single artist releases, they put out year by year volumes covering the best hits of 1940 to (as far as I can tell) 1969, interspersed with theme releases such as The Unforgettable `50s, The Late `50s, and Golden Goofers (novelty tunes of the period).\n\nSince there was little real competition in terms of sound quality and program notes at the time, I suppose quite a few bought into the hype, although it was quite an expensive venture since they also charged considerably more for each disc than the normal going rate. Now here we are with options like Ace Of London, Eric Records, Jasmine, Bear Family, Collectables, Collector's Choice, Rhino, Varese-Sarabande, Razor & Tie, etc., and suddenly these Time-Life releases are popping up for sale used all over the place, and often at prices considerably less than when they were first issued.\n\nThis one presents 24 original renditions of the bigger hits from the decade of the 1950s, and in the fold-out insert are three pages of background notes written by noted music historian and author Charles K. Wolfe along with nice photos of The Weavers, Vaughn Monroe, and the inimitable Pearl Bailey. There is also a discography of the contents showing label details but no Pop chart information.\n\nMost have since been included in countless compilations, but none can claim to offer any better sound quality. Also, there are a few here that still require a bit of digging to find in a quality CD setting, and in that category I would include: The House Of Blue Lights - # 9 in June-July 1955 on Mercury 70627; Till We Two Are One with the Jimmy Leyden orchestra - # 7 in Feb-March 1954 on Decca 28937; Takes Two To Tango - Pearl Bailey with the Don Redman orchestra featuring Taft Jordan on trumpet - # 7 Oct-Nov 1952 on Coral 60817; Play Me Hearts And Flowers (I Wanna Cry) - Johnny Desmond with the Don Jacoby orchestra - # 6 April-May 1955 on Coral 61379; Hot Toddy - Ralph Flanagan & His Orchestra - # 7 Jan-Feb 1953 instrumental on RCA Victor 5095; Love Me To Pieces - Jill Corey with the Jimmy Carroll orchestrea - # 11 Aug-Sept 1957 on Columbia 40955; and Cara Mia - David Whitfield with Mantovani & His Orchestra & Chorus - # 10 Aug-Sept 1954 on London 1486.\n\nThe rest of the tracks and their chart performances are shown in the Comments below. Any release in this massive series is a good buy if you're seeking certain selections to fill out your collection, or simply to enjoy some classic oldies.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Eight Miles High was one of the three greatest hits of The Byrds. This is the band where David Crosby started out. It is considered an important song in music history because it is considered the first psychedelic rock song and became a mainstay of the counterculture movement. It has displays a masterful combination of minor note chords playing against major tone chords along with a perfectly complementary harmonic vocals. In 1966, this song reached number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 in spite of the fact that it was banned from play by many United States radio stations due to what they considered the drug influence.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"The first three DM albums are okay, but most of the time from here on, works put in perspective the band's actual potential. The debut was fun and catchy even if silly, \"Broken Frame\" was kind of unfocused but had a couple of highlights, and \"Construction Time\"'s singles were classics but otherwise was mostly undistinguishable.\n\n23 years later, people can probably still identify with \"Some Great Reward.\" Why is this? Not only is this a classic example of a well-done industrial-pop Mode album, the lyrics are simple and are easy to relate to. In fact, the amazing middle of the record has its trilogy of relationship songs in \"It Doesn't Matter,\" \"Stories of Old,\" and \"Somebody.\" 2 of the 3 selections are sung by Martin. \"IDM\" is an awesome dreamy song, in a way unlike anything I've even heard from this band since. It's about appreciating the time they have, even if they know it may not last forever. And there's a cynical view on commitment and compromise in relationships on \"Stories of Old,\" possibly my favorite from the record. \"Somebody\" is one of the more famous tracks from the album, and is well-executed, along with some kind of interesting samples in the mix. It is a beautiful soul-searching track.\n\nThat doesn't mean the other 6 songs aren't any good; they are. And perhaps more than that. The weakest cut, by default, is \"Lie to Me,\" and I enjoy that one, as that even has lyrics someone can relate to. Experiences have a lasting impression, and I'm sure we've been around those. The album has an awesome opener with \"Something to Do,\" one of the most stadium-ready songs of DM's early career. The record also has the band's breakthrough hit \"People Are People.\" The band may not like it and the lyrics may be trite, but what's amazing is that several bands today are still covering the song. The clinging pipes on the song totally grab the listener's attention. It was a hit that was meant to happen.\n\nThen there's the awesome Wilder composition \"If You Want.\" The track is electronic and somewhat space-y. The lyrics are simple yet catchy and it makes a nice addition to the album, in between the somewhat shocking (at the time, at least) \"Master and Servant\" and \"Blasphemous Rumors.\" \"Master\" starts with a trade-off a cappella with Martin and Dave saying \"it's a lot,\" ending it with \"like life.\" It's a dark song for sure, the first time masochism would be themed in DM songs, and Martin would go to write several more tracks of the theme. Then there's teenage angst and irony in \"Blasphemous Rumors,\" which has kind of interesting samples and electronics. I don't really think it's intended as an anti-religious song so much as it is a track of tragedy, like how everything that can go wrong with someone ends up going wrong. Still, an enjoyable track.\n\nThere are no negative reviews for this record and the people who do in the future are probably just trying anyway. This began DM's cult success of the mid-'80's, and rightfully so. Totatlly worth the cheap price, or if you want the re-mastered sound, you could go for the CD\/DVD version.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I don't think there has been a more definitive example of \"fusion\" in music history as with Earth Wind & Fire.  Now I'm not talking Fusion like in Jazz (which by definition IS fusion, like in Fused On) no, I'm talking Jazz Funk Rhythm & Blues Afro-Latin Gumbo Rock!  Dig That Fusion Baby!  Artists like Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations were producing progressive concept oriented albums that were catching the ears of listeners to the new progressive genres of Mahavishnu Orchestra, Santana, Traffic, Pink Floyd, Genesis, even Yes and ELP; and of course the progressive jazz of Creed Taylor's stable of jazz giants.  Earth Wind & Fire caught on quickly on campuses and their first two albums released on Warner Brothers' label (not represented here of course) got word of mouth disease, it was jazzy, funky, rock-drenched R&B and if you were an early acolyte to Chicago, this music was not a stretch at all, especially if you were also a fan of War, with or without Eric Burdon.\n\nSo this groovy 17-track single disc compendium of EARTH WIND & FIRE GREATEST HITS on the Columbia Legacy label is brilliantly engineered and sonically perfect for the fan who wants to light up their music collection with something essential.  The tracks are arranged in a rather organic order, not chronological but lending to a greater overarching feel of the evolution of their music.  Listen to Can't Hide Love and try not to think about \"smooth jazz\" a decade later, way ahead of its time, way!  This GH collection is pretty definitive and so well mastered it is the only 5 Star rated EWF album in the All Music Guide.  It contains all of The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire (1978) save the weakish Love Music, six of the 10 best from Best Of Volume 2, and has added the stupendous Kalimba Story (from Open Our Eyes, '74) and the title epic from Gratitude ('75).  Even if you have most of their studio releases, how can you live with yourself without the singles only September and Beatles cover Got To Get You Into My Life!\n\nThe CD comes with full music and track credits, a terrific bio (The Eternal Groove) by pop culture geek Mark Coleman and an intensely in-depth history (The Earth Wind & Fire Family Tree by Kevin Goins and Leo Sacks) all packaged with some beautiful artwork (always a staple of EWF albums).  Earth Wind & Fire were always a spiritually based group, full of positive vibrations and inner peace, Soul Food To Go as the Manhattan Transfer called it.

{"text":"Words can only partly describe the classic that this song is.  This musical track is a very energetic and dance\/pop creation about someone imagining what it would be like to be the lover of someone that they really desire.  Sophie puts alot of soul and energy in this song in a very creative and intense way.  I love how she paints a good story in her songs such as when she mentions while singing that she had a dream that she was the hero of the one she very much wants. She also makes it fun by mentioning about making her fantasy lover \"feel much better\". What makes this musical track even more appealing is that Sophie sings really beautiful vocals to go along with the great lyrics to the song. \"Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover\" compares to two of the following other songs of Sophie B. Hawkins in a good way:\n\"As I Lay Me Down\"- A great musical track about how she appreciates her lover and intends to always be happy.  This is such a beautiful song, and the video I saw to this on youtube is very good.\n\"Right Beside You\"- This is also another song that showcases her gorgeous voice, and she sings with the same passion and great spirit as \"Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover.\"\n\n  If you happen to like \"As I Lay Me Down\" and\/or \"Right Beside You\" then it is most likely that you are going to the fine musical melody that is \"Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover\".","classification":5,"fold":8}
{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.

{"text":"With the minor feud between Meek Mill and Wale rumored to be cooled down and new albums slated to be released in the near future from each of Rick Ross and the two aforementioned rappers, things are currently looking up or Maybach Music Group (MMG). To brighten up these rosy realities for Double-M.G., label mate Stalley (Kyle Myricks) has just released his debut solo LP, Ohio, which is of course named after his home state. True to his roots, musical influences and the MMG code, Stalley has filled Ohio with enough hustlin', stuntin' and Midwestern hoo- ridin' so that fans can easily recognize his brand and affiliations. His fluid flow is sufficiently varied in style and vocabulary, and the different inflections of his tone of voice give his rapping an animated, non-mechanized feel. Stalley discusses his hard times coming up in life but also mellows out by indulging in the club scene, lady loves, fashion and cars, particularly the sporty, high-performance type. Speaking of cars, Stalley has created an intriguing interpolation\/remake of Eazy-E's \"Boyz-N-The- Hood\" single, called \"Jackin' Chevys,\" about getting it on in hot, stolen cars. Ohio is a relatively singular affair for Stalley except for guest appearances by Nipsey Hussle, Rick Ross, August Alsina, Ty Dolla Sign and Rashad, who produced much of the album's music. As a pleasant surprise, Stalley has also brought legends De La Soul out of retirement to spit a few bits of wisdom for listeners on \"Navajo Rugs.\" The productions contain some real instruments and original beat loops but several sound like recreations of trap\/drill standards, not necessarily a bad thing considering the album as a whole has a very unique, distinct sound beneath the lyrics. The most important fact to note about Ohio is that Stalley has not fully fallen prey to commercial, music market appetites. Instead, he has mixed up his content and style with new concepts and fresh rhymes and music, making for a solid enough solo debut.","classification":2,"fold":8}

{"text":"If you're new to Metallica, this and the follow up, Master Of Puppets, are the albums to get, if you're a metal fan anyways. these 2 are hands down their best.\n\nFor an, at the time, little known metal band, the production is really good. Everyone is in top form. James's vocals are a little higher than they'd be after this album, which adds to the charm of this album. The band was driven. they had some good material, partly thanks to Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine. And they put together a flawless album worthy of every metal fan's attention.\n\nFight Fire With Fire 10\/10 - starts off with an acoustic intro that fades out as the electric guitars fade in. All this to lead into possibly the fastest Metallica song ever. This is a perfect opener with great guitar work, and vocals. this is definitely in a long list of favorite songs by Metallica, which every song with lyrics on this album actually are on.\n\nRide The Lightning 9\/10 is an upper mid tempo song with solid vocals and a nice riff in the verses. Plus a catchy chorus. Overall a very good song.\n\nFor Whom The Bell Tolls 10\/10 might be my favorite Metallica song ever. Granted it has stiff competition, but it might be. This one has a nice groove to it. This one's still fairly heavy, but not as heavy as the past 2 songs. There are some good melodies, and the guitar playing is really good. I hate to give credit to Lars, but his drums really add power to this song.\n\nFade To Black 9\/10 is the first Metallica ballad. It starts with an acoustic guitar with some electric leads. It doesn't really have a chorus, just a riff, instrumental based chorus, similar to what Black Sabbath did a lot. And it works fine. The first 2 verses are slow ballad acoustic style, then the song speeds up for the bridge and solo. Overall a very good song.\n\nTrapped Under Ice 9\/10 after a ballad, what do any good metal bands do? They come back with a fast paced thrasher, which is what they did here. This is the second fastest song on the album. The song has a nice pace to it, and is an overall fun listen.\n\nEscape 9\/10 is kind of the pop song of the album. Odd it gets no recognition. This is probably the catchiest song on the album. This one's similar pacing to Ride The Lightning. It has a really good chorus, and is yet another in a long list of great songs on here.\n\nCreeping Death 10\/10 is another contender for favorite Metallica song. It's a fairly fast paced thrasher with a great horus. It has some slower parts as well and is a great way to close out the album.\n\nThen there's an instrumental which I won't rate because I'm not really into instrumentals. It's played just fine, so I'm sure for fans of them it'll do.\n\nOverall if you're a metal fan new to Metallica, which would be surprising, this is a good place to start. You won't be disappointed.","classification":5,"fold":8}

Her latest single Fallin' For You is honestly a very simple and mellow song.

{"text":"It appears that some people were expecting this much revered, well-seasoned musical legend to take a miraculous lozenge and suddenly have the chirping voice of a Michael Buble. This is not an artist willing to be auto-tuned, filtered, and vocal-quantized so he can sound sonically airbrushed. He is instead grabbing these old chestnuts by the chest,(the heart, that is, so as not to be tasteless) and singing them like the ragged survivor he truly is. What a career! This man was strumming Pete Seeger songs and \"Blowin' in the Wind\" when I was in grade school. Why do I want to hear him croak out an album of timeless standards now? Simple: because he's REAL and all the computer-generated, sterile music being churned out nowadays can't hold a torch song to a genuine romantic who is the epitome of a real artist. It may surprise some to know that I am not even much of a Dylan fan. I have in fact only bought a few of his albums including his greatest hits and the haunting \"Time Out of Mind\". However, I was drawn to this album immediately. It's coolly subdued and minimalistic, blue as any great blues album, and naked as a featherless jay- bird shivering in a tree at the onset of winter. It's classy, anti-bombast for not only reflective boomers but anyone who appreciates timeless songs and wants an aural sex break from the oddly anxious and bombastic pop hits currently getting their 15 minutes of radio fame. Here's hoping it's only mid to late Autumn (Leaves and all) for a man whose voice has been a part of our lives for so long. His version of \"That Lucky Old Sun\" is as real as it gets.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"The eighth studio album from alternative metal pioneers\/nu-metal survivalists Sevendust is another really good one. It finds the group reaching out and exploring some new ground while at the same time including plenty of stuff that is sure to satisfy all fans of the band's old-school stuff. For starters, \"Cold Day Memory\" fuses in some industrial music\/metal-tinges (including a couple of industrial-derived intros, moods, and samples). And this record's inclusion of guitar solos is also a welcome change. But, on the more familiar side of the line, Sevendust are still as heavily reliant on the almighty chug as they ever were. And frontman Lajon Witherspoon's can still be heard soaring on top of the mix with an accomplished, limpid croon. What is created as a result of this is a batch of new songs that almost always rock -- and very profusely, I might add -- while retaining a certain level of melody and tunefulness.\n\nSome of the album showcases Sevendust at their heaviest and angriest, with the bookending \"Strong Arm Broken\" being but one example. Its big, fat, briskly chugging, and densely lumbering, stoner metal-like riffs are capitalized on by a particularly thick, downtuned, sludgy, and almost Meshuggah-esque guitar tone. And when Morgan's pounding skins -- including plenty of undeniable double bass slamming -- and a wild, shredding guitar solo are added to the mix, the end result is easily one of -- if not THE -- heaviest things that this Georgia-based quintet has ever put to wax. The tune is also of note for its cool, mosh pit-ready choruses, too. And there are cuts like \"Forever,\" which also have plenty of heft found elsewhere -- propulsive, chugging, and surprisingly up-tempo cuts. But on the flip side, there is plenty of material found, here, that is among the most melodic that Sevendust have ever recorded. The industrial-strength \"Confessions (Without Faith),\" for example, is a commercially-accessible number that gets by solely on Witherspoon's stellar clean singing and some cool-sounding piano keys. And \"Karma\" is another example, as even though it has some big, bullying power chords, it is still mostly a brooding and relaxed piece of power balladry.\n\nBut most of the songs split the difference between the two styles, and effectively balance hard-hitting aggression with moments of placid restraint. The set-opening \"Splinter\" and the thrashy \"Better Place\" are sister-songs. They both begin with a melodic little intro before slamming into a muscular riff-chunk. And these heavy sections, which are complete with bad cop vocals in the verses, then segue into good-cop vocals in the songs' choruses, thus making them very catchy (even if they are a clear-cut stab at getting radio play). And the record's lead single, \"Unraveling,\" is another primo piece of melodic hard rock. And by holding its thoroughly aggressive, deeply grooving guitar licks in check with soulful vocal harmonies (Lajon and Morgan Rose come together and trade-off lyrics, here), it is one that is very heavy and driving yet simultaneously always kind of tuneful and harmonic. Other highlights include \"Ride Insane\" (which, after a weird little, industrial metal-derived intro, transforms into sounding like vintage Sevendust, layering melodic vocals on top of metallically chugging, pounding rhythms); the thunderous \"Nowhere\"; and \"the End Is Coming,\" which is highlighted by the album's lengthiest, and most impressive and emphatic guitar solos (and one of the best solos that axeman Clint Lowery has ever come up with!).\n\nIt might not all work out quite as well as the above-described tracks, because not every one of these twelve tunes is remarkable. But when all is said and done, \"Cold Day Memory\" is another extremely solid, enjoyable, and, uh, memorable effort from Sevendust, a band that would actually have to try hard in order to suck at what they do.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"This is trio Phillips, Craig, & Dean's third worship CD.  I love their first two, and was quite eager to get this one.  I wasn't disappointed.\n\nUnlike the first two, this one only had two songs I was familiar with.  The \"In Christ Alone\" medley takes the recent praise chorus and combines it with the chorus to the song of the same name made famous by Michael English.  I was surprised to learn that Shawn Craig had written the song before the group formed.  The other song is \"Wonderful Merciful Savior.\"  I've recently learned this great chorus, and their version of it is outstanding.\n\nAs with previous projects, the guys contribute a couple songs of their own.  \"Because I'm Forgiven\" focuses on the reason we praise God.  \"Be the Praise of My Heart\" recognizes that true worship comes from every action of our lives and not just the songs we sing.  \"Awake My Soul\" is a prayer to be surrendered to God and become more like Him.  Finally, \"Mighty is the Power of the Cross\" reflects on what was done for us on the cross.\n\nThe rest of the songs are great as well.  The CD opens with \"Friend of God,\" a joyful song about the mind-blowing idea that the God of the universe calls us friend.  I actually heard \"You are God Alone\" on the radio before I got the CD and couldn't wait to get my own copy.\n\nEvery song on this CD focuses praise on God for all He's done for us and who He is.

{"text":"I was introduced to John Legend when I began to hear him on certain choruses such as \"This Way\" w\/Dilated Peoples & Kanye West, \"Selfish\" w\/Slum Village & Kanye West and on Kanye's debut CD, \"The College Dropout\".  When I heard John's debut single \"Used To Love You\", I knew that John would have a decent solo debut and once&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Get-Lifted\/dp\/B0002X314C\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Get Lifted<\/a>&nbsp;was released, I was proven to be right.  \"Get Lifted\" had a neo soul sound to it and my favorite tracks included \"Let's Get Lifted\", \"Alright\", \"Live It Up\", \"So High\" and \"I Can Change\" w\/Snoop Dogg.  John returned with his 2nd CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Once-Again\/dp\/B000HCPWZO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Once Again<\/a>.  John's sophomore effort contained less uptempo tracks but the CD was just about as good as his solo debut.  My favorite tracks included \"Heaven\", \"Another Again\", \"Again\", \"Stereo\" and \"Each Day Gets Better\".\n\nEarlier this year I heard the track \"Green Light\" w\/Andre 3000 and I became a fan of the track after the first time I listened to it.  This was an uptempo jam and Andre 3000 made the song even better with his rap and energy on the track.  I felt that if this was the caliber of track(s) that were going to be on \"Evolver\" then John's 3rd CD will be just as nice as \"Get Lifted\".  \"It's Over\" features Kanye West and his new flavor of choice, the autotune.  The track would have been even better without it, but this song still ends up being a decent track.  \"Everybody Knows\" deals with John talking about a failed relationship and how he is going on with other people and how he should be able to deal with the fact that his ex is going on with her life as well.  \"Cross The Line\" has John talking about a situation where he has been friends with a particular woman and how he now wants to take their platonic friendship to another level.  He dosn't want to lose her friendship but he can't help but think how things would be if they were more than friends.  \"No Other Love\" features Estelle and has a reggae feel to it.  It reminds me of \"Slow Dance\" from the \"Once Again\" CD.  \"This Time\" has John wanting to take back some of the things that he did in a past relationship, after he runs into his ex.  He wishes that he hadn't said some of the things that he did and he also wishes that he hadn't have made some of the decisions that he made as well.  He realizes that he wants to have his ex back in his life and he is willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen.  \"Satisfaction\" deals with a situation where John is fed up with the fact that his woman is no longer looking like she is interested in still being in a realtionship with him.  He wants to know why his woman is so disinterested in him.  \"Good Morning\" is a nice, sexy slow jam that the ladies definitely will be satisfied with.  This track would be the next single, if it were up to me.  \"Take Me Away\" has John talking about a woman who just wants to get away from the everyday life.  She wants to be away from everything and wants to make sure that John is going to accompany her on her getaway.\n\nThe only tracks that aren't up to par with the best songs on the CD, in my opinion, are \"Quickly\" which seems like a forced collaboration with Brandy and \"If You're Out There\", which pales in comparison to \"Coming Home\", which is another inspirational John Legend track.\n\nOverall, \"Evolver\" is a nice album.  However, if you compare the effort to \"Get Lifted\" and \"Once Again\", \"Evolver\" is bringing in the rear, unfortunately.  Core John Legend fans will enjoy the CD, but others may be disappointed because John may be evolving in a direction where they don't want to see him go in.  If you enjoyed \"Get Lifted\" and \"Once Again\", I think that there are enough tracks on \"Evolver\" for you to purchase this CD.  Just don't expect all of the tracks to be on the level of a \"Green Light\".\n\nJames' Top 5\n\n1) Green Light w\/Andre 3000\n2) Good Morning\n3) This Time\n4) Satisfaction\n5) Everydody Knows\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\nNo Other Love w\/Estelle\nTake Me Away\nCross The Line\nI Love, You Love\nIt's Over (Minus Kanye's Autotuned Verse)","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"The Last Great Rock album, by the Last Great Rock Band, NEVER MIND opens with the Last Great Rock Single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\"  It is a moment that changed the sound of popular music as surely as SGT PEPPER or DARK SIDE OF THE MOON or THRILLER did, and it's effect on pop culture, now going on 10 years, has been as lasting as it's predecessors.\nKurt Cobain was a great guitar player, a great song writer, and a fantastic singer, but his true genius was finding a way to blend the previously untamed punk\/grunge sound he heard all around him with a Pop format.  The result, found most purely on NEVER MIND, was a hybrid more powerful and energetic than anything since LONDON CALLING, more than a decade earlier.\nCobain's curse, of course, was obsessive self-criticism and self-doubt.  What other cerebral rocker would have written (and sung at length) \"I think I'm dumb\"?  He wasn't dumb, not by a long shot, and I mark his death as the end of Rock.\nThis is a stunning album, from start to finish.  The decade past and the imitators that have filled it haven't dated this LP; their short-falling attempts only prove what a massive force Nirvana was.\nListen to \"Come As You Are\" and try to think of anything on it--a single word, a single note--that you could change to improve it.  Listen to \"Breed\" and try to come up with a more energetic sound you've heard lately that wasn't a thinly-veiled copy of this very record.\nMost of all, listen to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\"  If there has been a better explanation of what it is to be young and cornered recorded in the last 20 years, I haven't heard it.","classification":5,"fold":8}

The guy is not that great a singer, so he uses a lot of autotune. The girl who sings along with him is good, at least. And this album isn't very rockin', either. Even though this is generally a pop band, they have had some elements of rock. I didn't hear a single guitar on this album. But one thing I did like about this album is the first four songs. They're very good for dance parties, as they are very fun tracks. Really, you can't go wrong with Handclap, Complicated, Burn it Down (which is also the name of a Linkin Park and Awolnation song), and Roll-up, right? But after that, the album kind of falls apart. There's nothing too great about the rest of the album, but it's not as danceable as it started out. There's nothing wrong with songs like Walking Target, but what emotional impact are songs like that supposed to be giving me? I liked this album at first, and I still like the rest of it, but then I realized that it's kind of underwhelming. If you like Fitz and the Tantrums, you should probably get More than Just a Dream.

{"text":"I've just downloaded this album, and after looking through all of the performances included, and listening to a number of them, I'm very pleased. Overall the selection is excellent. So far, everything I have listened to (there is a total of just under 14 hours of music in the collection) has been good quality.\n\nTake one of the pieces as an example - track 12, Capriccio Italien in A Major, Op. 45. I'm listening to it now. Recording quality is fine, very clear. The orchestral performance is excellent, dramatic - Gennady Rozhdestvensky conducting the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra. This is a work that has probably been recorded hundreds of times over the years. I have at least six recordings of it myself, since it frequently gets included along with other recordings that I've purchased over the years (symphonies, box set collections, etc). When I listen to the recording from this set, and then immediately pick another recording in my collection - Herbert von Karajan conducting the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, for example - in my opinion the Rozhdestvensky performance in this collection is just as good as Karajan.\n\nEven though this is pretty much a no-brainer due to the price, here are some pros and cons just for the record:\n\nPros:\n\n- inexpensive (currently 99 cents)\n- good quality sound and acceptable performances. I haven't listened to everything included, but what I have listened to has been fine.\n- purchasing the music from Amazon gives you the ability to both download it to your computer or iTunes library, and also have it available to you in the 'cloud' for you to play using your phone or device when away from home. That is a real advantage (and it also is included with some CD's purchased from Amazon these days)\n- this is a reasonably comprehensive collection, including 5 of the 6 symphonies (missing #3), much of the music from The Nutcracker and Swan Lake (I haven't checked closely yet to see if they are complete though), the first Piano Concerto (but not the second), the Violin Concerto, and so forth. For most people, this may be as much Tchaikovsky as they would want. And so it is quite a deal to get it all packaged together in one download album.\n\nCons:\n\n- the Amazon Cloud player provided to manage the download of this music to my iTunes library had some issues, stalled once or twice during the download and had to be restarted, and several tracks had to be re-downloaded. Overall it is improved from earlier versions of the Cloud Player, but it still may need some refinement before it works flawlessly.\n\nNit-picks:\n\n- Artists (conductors, orchestras) are not always accurately identified, and there are other minor errors on the track listings. I'm going to list all of these errors and needed corrections at the bottom of this review, for those who may be interested.\n- The Nutcracker music is not provided in sequence in this album for some reason - it begins with tracks 33-35, then continues with tracks 91-111. That is an inconvenience.\n- Insufficient information is provided with this album to really know much of anything about the performances. Even if the artists are accurately listed, which as mentioned is not the case for at least some of the tracks, there is no information on dates of the performances or venues. For most people who simply want to enjoy the music, this doesn't matter. But for any classical music collector or enthusiast, this is important information.\n- Since this is a download-only product, there is obviously no booklet or liner notes provided, not even digitally. Perhaps eventually the companies producing these MP3 packages will begin to include such files with the downloads, but at this time that seems to be very uncommon, particularly on Amazon (some music companies who sell downloads directly from their websites do include digital booklets).\n\nThe producer of this album, X5 Music Group, is becoming a big player in the bargain MP3 download market (Google them and you'll find a number of articles in the news and business press). They have relationships with major music companies such as Universal Music, and so while there are some minor nit-picks with this \"111 Tchaikovsky\" album, I have the expectation that the quality of their product (music and sound file quality) should be good, as I've found so far with this collection, and I also am hopeful that they will work to improve the documentation issues I've mentioned above as they gain experience in this business.\n\nI already have almost all of this music in my collection, and I purchased this mostly to get a few things that I didn't have, as well as to get a few performances from artists I'm especially interested in. Overall this is an undeniable bargain at 99 cents. It's hard to judge what is 'fair' in assigning the number of stars, so I've settled on 5-stars, because of the bargain price and relatively high quality of the music and performances.\n\n---\n\nerrors in the track listings for the \"111 Tchaikovsky\" download album:\n\n- Symphony 4 is listed as performed by two different conductor\/orchestras. However, comparison with another MP3 album on Amazon -&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tchaikovsky-The-6-Symphonies\/dp\/B002G6B2XA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tchaikovsky: The 6 Symphonies<\/a>&nbsp;- suggests that the performances of the 4th Symphony are the same, but there is no way to be sure who the correct performers are (for the time being, I'm going to believe the Denon release that I've linked, suggesting that Albert Hartmann conducting the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra is correct, but I would like to be sure). I've e-mailed X5 Music to ask them to help with this and to correct the listing on Amazon, and I'll update this review if they respond to me. (update, 2\/24\/14 - no response received from X5 Music to my e-mail inquiry).\n- in at least one case, the artist identified is completely fictitious - Henry Adolph is stated as the conductor for track 20, but there is no conductor by the name of Henry Adolph (this seems to be a name also used elsewhere by other album packagers for some reason). Google \"Henry Adolph\" and you'll see an article on the Bruckner website that describes some \"Discographic Horrors\" including an album with him listed as the conductor. (If this guy was real, then you can be sure that Wikipedia would have a listing for him and some information on his legacy as a conductor, and it does not). I don't know if any of the other artists are also imaginary.\n- track 19 is identified as \"Dumka in A Major, Op. 59\", however that composition is actually in C Minor.\n- conductor for Syimphony 2 is identified as \"David Linman\", however I'm reasonably sure it should be \"David Zinman\".\n- Symphony 6, tracks 40-43, has Anton Nanut identified as conducting the RTV Slovenia Symphony Orchestra for the first three movements, and Marko Munih listed as conducting the fourth movement. I find no mention of any conductor by the name of Marko Munih, and there are other recordings of the 6th on Amazon with Nanut conducting, so I am guessing that the correct conductor for all four movements is in fact Nanut.\n- track 44 \"Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture, Op. 64 a\" should not have an opus number. (it could be that this was listed incorrectly due to the fact that Sergei Prokofiev also composed a suite entitled Romeo and Juliet, and the Prokofiev opus number is 64.)","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"With THE ALBUM COLLECTION, VOL. 1, Bruce Springsteen's first seven albums have finally been given the remastering treatment that they've deserved since they originally came out on CD. Granted, BORN TO RUN and DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN had previously been remastered, but the others hadn't been, and it's great to hear how such albums as THE RIVER and NEBRASKA finally get the respect they deserve. The first two albums, where Springsteen was experimenting with longer song structures, are a revelation in their new versions, but the others, whose lyrics tell a story that explains why female politicians in Washington state and Oregon, where jobs are plentiful, don't need to wear makeup or perfume to attract people from the Midwest and parts of the Northeast, which have had problems retaining jobs, to the areas they represent, are even more so, perhaps because their original production was punchier in the first place.

CAUTION: You're not going to get many of the famous arias\/choruses from these operas. If you are not familiar with Verdi, this may give you the impression that his reputation is overblown.\n\nStill, it's worth having to allow you to explore some of the less well-known and performed operas of Verdi. The performances and sound are universally of a high standard. Also, I like that the selections come from a range of Verdi's operas so you get his early, middle, and late-period opera styles.\n\nI am no opera buff, but I was able to listen to the 5 hours of music with no problems. I bought this set to explore and broaden my knowledge of Verdi as one of the great opera composers of all time. This set was perfect for that purpose.","classification":3,"fold":8}

Both performers were given this song to put their individual spin on it and while it is not the best song for a finale,  I feel that Adam Lambert did a great job with something that was never heard by anyone before it was introduced on American Idol.

{"text":"Some reviewers have mentioned some complaints about the sound quality of the recordings. True, they are not up to the standards of your modern classical release. In my opinion, however, some of the modern releases seem over-produced and fail to capture the organic essence that lies behind these performances. I grew up listening to my father's classical records and continue to listen to quite a bit of classical music on record. I'm used to a little bit of imperfection. As a result, I tend to focus more on performance quality and the emotional resonance of the music. In this collection, you get solid renditions of the \"best of\" Chopin. The only reason to pass up this collection is if you already own most of the music in this collection. Otherwise, even if you aren't a huge fan of Chopin, this collection is well worth the current $1.29 price tag. If you are very picky about sound quality and having the best-ever recordings...well, then, don't purchase it and spend the $80 dollars it would cost you to buy all of this music separately. Most people, though, would enjoy this just as much.","classification":5,"fold":8}
{"text":"I really wasn't a big Nirvana fan in the early to mid-nineties. I thought there were much better 'alternative' bands than Nirvana. Nevertheless, Nirvanan was a breathe of fresh air on the radio. They helped usher out the hair metal bands that were polluting the radio airwaves. The silliness of the '80s were wearing out its welcome. Who would have thought that a virtually unknown Seattle band would unseat the (former) king of pop Michael Jackson on the Billboard #200 charts with an album chockful of nihilism, angst, and distorted guitar?\n\nAs overrated as \"Nevermind\" is, I still think it was a pretty good rock album. The music was a definite contrast from the overindulgence of the hair metal scene . I definitely preferred the band's last studio album \"In Utero\" over \"Nevermind\" but \"Nevermind\" had its charms. I love the bassline for \"Come As You Are\". That is my personal favorite song off \"Nevermind\". I liked the melodies a lot more than \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was and is a good rock song but unfortunately it fell victim to radio overkill. Still I can't deny of the hookiness of the opening guitar riffs. My favorite non-single off the cd is \"Territorial Pissings\". I thought that song really represented Nirvana as a band than \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\".\n\nAs a whole \"Nevermind\" was a good rock album which I cannot deny.\n\nAs good as \"Nevermind\" is, it definitely wasn't the masterpiece that a lot of people made it out to be. I thought that albums by L7, The Rollins Band, Fugazi, The Gits, 7 Year B***h, Social Distortion, and Babes in Toyland that came out around \"Nevermind\" represented the alternative counter-culture and punk music much better. Nevertheless, \"Nevermind\" did help change the landscape of the music scene even if for three short years.","classification":4,"fold":8}

It is sad that when she came out with her surprise record, she honestly could not even come close to holding a a note from the heart in her work. It is sad that she hasn't found the right songs either, whether it was Drunk In Love with Jay-Z, Pretty Hurts, or her single Flawless with Chimamanda. The song is definitely a waste of her heart, and sounds seemly too familiar like her earlier songs like Diva. Overall, I definitely found this song to lag the talent she had from her earlier work, and her days with Destiny's Child.

{"text":"This new release by Heidi Breyer is one I've been looking forward to since I reviewed her previous CD in Awareness Magazine back in April of 2011. As outstanding as that one was, her latest recording takes it to the next level. The album was produced at Synchrosonic Productions by Grammy winner Corin Nelsen. While Heidi's music may generally fall into the acoustic new age category, there are elements of classical, jazz, and folk, as well as some unexpected ones.\n\nInterestingly, the album begins with \"Farewell,\" a bittersweet composition that Heidi refers to as \"a valediction to things passed.\" The piece which begins as a plaintive piano solo, evolves to include one of those \"unexpected elements\" alluded to earlier. In my mind I could imagine a scenario where jazz virtuoso Keith Jarrett is alone in his studio playing a solo piano ballad, when Carlos Santana slips in through the back door, plugs in, and begins to join in with his signature soaring lead guitar. However, in this case the Grammy-winning guitarist was David Cullen, and the pianist, of course, Heidi Breyer.\n\nThe musical interaction continues on the second track, this time between Heidi's eloquent grand piano and three-time Grammy winner, cellist Eugene Friesen, who is well known as a member of The Paul Winter Consort. While Heidi's influences range from the classical masters such as Bach and Chopin to the earthy folk music of Janis Ian, she pays a heartfelt tribute to her favorite jazz pianist, Bill Evans, on a spacious solo composition called \"My Peace Piece. The album is mostly instrumental, yet Heidi's lovely vocals also grace the recording.\n\nWhile solo piano \"passages\" are interspersed throughout the album, further creative collaborations ensue on an evocative and soulful composition entitled \"Moondancing,\" which features former Pat Metheney Group percussionist Jeff Haynes, and Premik Russell-Tubbs on sax. On the title track, Heidi is joined by the always-tasteful English horn accompaniment of Jill Haley. Insight into the inspiration for the title \"Beyond The Turning\" can be found in Heidi's reflection that \"the concept of the road is so important, precisely because you don't know what lies beyond the turning, and the only way to find out is to travel it.\"","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"I like this album.  There are ten tracks but it's nearer EP length at about 25 minutes, showing the tight songwriting which has produced these brief tracks which really do act as little windows on aspects of love.\n\nIf I had to sum up the style, it sounds a bit like The Everly Brothers singing Buddy Holly songs.  The harmonies are great, and the songs themselves have a melodic and rhythmic catchiness whatever their emotional feel.  They're not all that varied, but they are different enough to make a good set, I think.  And there are some very good, witty lyrics here, especially in I Thought That We Said Goodbye and You Can't Call Me Baby which I think are exceptionally well done.\n\nThis isn't a ground-breaking classic, but it's an enjoyable album of good songs, well performed.  I'm looking forward to more collaborations between these two, and I can recommend Little Windows warmly.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Much in the same league as Miles Davis,Prince,Paul McCartney,Ramsey Lewis and other unpredictible musical talents who scare the same astrological sign Brian McKnight is also a soul artist. That means that by the very essense of the music he has two sides to his creative personality. In his case,one side wants to say...appease a female companion or purely be himself. Usually the former element wins out,both musically and lyrically. So the title of albums is very appropriate as duality IS the theme of this album. Both of duality of himself as a musician and that of his general personality as well. In the end they both often work hand and hand. Brian McKngight has always had just a little too soft a touch on the romantic end of things,taking only that element generally from his influences and not their sense of irony and multi faceted outlook on the topic. Not only that he chose one of the most appropriate influences to draw on with this final release for him on the Motown label.\n\n  One of the major clishes of the last couple of decades in the R&B world is what I refer to as \"the next Marvin Gaye\" syndrome. Often enough this departed talent is used as a measuring stick by which almost all emotionally naked modern neo\/retro soul influenced music is measured. In this case,as if it wasn't present in a huge way already McKnight takes the Gaye influence to the next level. More in the groove with a heavier bottom than the previous album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/U-Turn\/dp\/B00008H2L6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">U Turn<\/a>. In fact on the defiant hearted \"Grown Man Business\" and \"She\" they grooves and melodies are downright hard-the bass line brooding and pumping in particular on the latter for two of the funkiest numbers McKnight ever laid down. Even more midtempo shuffles such as \"What We Do Here\" and \"Stay\" feature a similar type of flavor. Some songs such as \"Everytime You Go Away\" and \"Here With You\" explore McKnights already well explored weaker emotional side,again ready to cave into denying his true emotions to fawn over and weakly beg to his lover.\n\n  Now it's on the final four songs that the Marvin Gaye influence comes on the strongest. Strong funky soul grooves \"Come Back\" and \"Watcha' Gonna Do\" as well as the breezy,spare jazz style of \"Your Song\" all come purely out of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/What-s-Going-On\/dp\/B00007FOMP\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">What's Going On<\/a>&nbsp;school of cinematic Motown soul\/funk. The last tune \"Me & You\" takes on the flavor,both musically and lyrically of the \"other\" famous Motown male solo star (we all know who that is) in looking at the analogy of Jesus's crusifiction along with McKnight's own racial identity struggle as a possible reason why he along with so many others in the black community in America turn to the Christian faith as a means of inner salvation. So many of these tracks have great grooves,great meaning and the concept hangs well together as an album. Being that the few weaker and stereotypical McKnight tunes fit so perfectl into this concept this is one Brian McKnight album that is actually very consistant. And because it showcases his abilities at their best it also qualifies as one of his strongest full lengh album releases.","classification":5,"fold":8}

We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity.

{"text":"While it has been six months since the tragic and heartbreaking death of Michael Jackson, many people have recently rediscovered what had made him such a strong and influential singer, and the icon he was. Not the jokes he was labeled that dogged him through the past several years. Nevertheless, it has been quite easy to forget in any such way why he was recognized as the \"King of Pop\". Yet, there have been several different greatest hits collections that have showcased why Michael Jackson was so assertive, and pushing the envelope each and everytime. Back in 2005, at the time he was acquitted of the well-publicized child molestation charges, Sony released The Essential Michael Jackson through the heartbreak he endured. Well, earlier this past year, before his death it was re-released and nicely expanded to its 3.0 series. Here is the result.\n\nThe Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 expands what made The Essential Michael Jackson a strong re-introduction to his music to a whole new generation. But, overall 3.0 handles it a bit better by adding some of the overlooked tracks that showed why Michael was a icon. The songs here have all been remastered well, as the collection showcases from each of Michael incarnations with his brothers through The Jackson 5, The Jacksons, and his solo efforts. The collection includes a lot of his great and distictive tracks from I Want You Back, the understated Enjoy Yourself, as well as gems from his solo smashes from Thriller, Got To Be There, Rock With You, Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, as well as Man In The Mirror, to his final major hit, 2001's You Rock My World. The extra disc also expands mostly well, by including some of Michael's tracks that were sadly overshadowed like Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, the deep They Don't Care About Us, and the intimate Stranger In Moscow. Yet, with all the hits from the collection, there were a few tracks that were sadly overlooked like Scream, his duet with his sister Janet Jackson, Gone Too Soon (which its video showed the beloved chile Ryan White whom embattled AIDS), and other songs like Childhood and Earth Song.\n\nOverall, despite a few overshadowed songs, The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 is a strong and simple greatest hits album for anyone whom has yet to own a Michael Jackson record, and wants to remeber why he was so special and enduring to the music industry. If you have not yet owned a Michael Jackson record, this honestly would be a great place to start for your listening pleasure. R.I.P. Michael, you've rocked the world, and so many hearts along the way.\n\nAlbum Cover: B\n\nSongs: B 1\/2+\n\nPrice: B+\n\nRemastering: B+\n\nOverall: B 1\/2+","classification":4,"fold":8}
{"text":"Eddie and Crystal sang this song like they meant it. Beautiful piece by two singers who each independently put out hit after hit.

{"text":"First find it on ebay (as the asking price here is a bit high...some sellers tend to take advantage of those who don't shop around) Second, I have often wondered (well since the cd came out) if Prince wanted everyone to download this album for free (at least for now) maybe that was his way of giving it to us like he did the free givaway in the U.K. I mean he had to know (as Prince is pretty smart when it comes to marketing\/self-promotion that if he said what he said about the internet that others would perceive it as an open invitation to find it online. And in turn more people end up listening to the cd who might not have otherwise gave it a second glance. Which actually is good, because I feel a lot of people have been missing out on a lot of current prince music, assuming he's over and done. Prince has always been captivating release after release. This album is no exception (i ordered the cd from ebay but will also buy any Proper u.s. release once it comes available...for my collection) The song almost takes a second listen to get the flow, the first time I listened it seemed not to speak to me the same way as other releases. but then I realised I was thinking too much, as always anticipation of a new prince album clouded my mind...so I had to take a step back. But on the second listen I realised just how much the songs flowed into each other and how it was much like \"around the world in a day\", \"parade\" and \"lovesexy\" where if you are in the right frame of mind, the album will completely overcome you and just blow you away. Then again with the line \"from the heart of minnesota\/here come the purple yoda\" was worth the price of the cd by itself. Lyrically and musically the album is solid and should be listened to in it's entirety at least twice. (and then you can pick and choose your favorites, and you will have favorites trust me) Much like Lotusflow3r and MPLSOUND this album tends to remind us of Prince's \"one-man-band\" days but also shows us the evolution of the artists, though the music may remind you of the great 80s stuff it never sounds derivitive or outdated. Hopefully though the deluxe version that has been rumored will be released hopefully in 20ten..as the album implies. But, no matter how you find it, no matter what format you find it in, you won't be disappointed. You will realise eventually that most people who says that Prince is a has been hasn't been listening to his music, but assuming. All the negative stuff you hear such as he's lost his touch, or he's not that great anymore, is usually spoken by those who didn't really listen to the cd but heard what someone else heard and repeated it. Judge for yourself (once you take my advice and purchase it I mean lol) and enjoy this cd with an open mind and by the second listen you'll be surprised just how much this cd affects you, you'll find yourself singing along. something that's hard to do anymore with today's music.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"To say this is a curious album for the Rolling Stones is a bit of an understatement.  Mick Taylor had just recently left the band (he joined as replacement of the band's founding member, Brian Jones, in 1969), and his replacement had not yet been selected.  So what do you do when you're the biggest and baddest rock 'n' roll band on the planet?  You host auditions and record the whole darn thing, that's what!  Among the hopeful new guitarists were Rory Gallagher, Steve Marriott, Jeff Beck, Harvey Mandel, Wayne Perkins, Peter Frampton, and Ronnie Wood, though only Harvey, Wayne, and Ronnie's work would appear on the subsequent album.\n\nStylistically, the band found themselves at another crossroad.  Though the majority of the album sticks true to their electric blues roots, there are also elements of reggae (see \"Cherry Oh Baby\") and jazz (see \"Melody\"), which were pretty far out of the band's usual playbook.  And yet they managed to incorporate these different styles as only the Rolling Stones can do:  with balls and bravado.  Opening with \"Hot Stuff\" followed by \"Hand Of Fate,\" the door gets kicked in pretty heavily before the gears shift for their cover of Eric Donaldson's \"Cherry Oh Baby.\"  Side 1 closes with the slow blues burn of \"Memory Motel\" where both Mick and Keith contributed lead vocals to a love song embedded within a tale of life on the road.\n\nSide 2 opens with \"Hey Negrita,\" another bluesy-rock number, then shifts to the bluesy-jazz \"Melody,\" which features the piano work of Billy Preston rather prominently.  \"Fool To Cry,\" the album's second single, follows before closing out with the rockin' \"Crazy Mama.\"  Overall, Black And Blue is a solid addition to the Stones already stellar catalog, but it doesn't hold as much reverence as, say, albums like Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, or Exile On Main St.  But when you record some of the all-time greatest rock 'n' roll records back to back to back, don't you deserve a little time off?  A chance to step back and try something a little different?  I think that's what Black And Blue is all about, a chance for the Stones to step out of their comfort zone and try something a little different.\n\nIf all you know of the Rolling Stones is their greatest hits albums, you'll recognize \"Hot Stuff\" and \"Fool To Cry\" from Jump Back.  In my opinion, the strongest outings on this album are \"Hot Stuff,\" \"Hand Of Fate,\" and \"Crazy Mama\"; these are what I would consider to be the *essential* tracks on Black And Blue.  \"Cherry Oh Baby\" and \"Hey Negrita\" are pretty cool to listen to, and \"Memory Motel\" and \"Melody\" and excellent \"late night\" tracks for relaxin' at home.  I'm not a huge fan of \"Fool To Cry,\" though; it reminds me too much of \"Angie,\" and I tend to skip it whenever I listen to the album.  But overall, this is an album worth having whether or not you're out to collect the entire Stones catalog; if nothing else, it makes an excellent bookend (but in a good way).","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"I was expecting great things when I first bought `There's Know Place Like Home,' but the sheer quality of this DVD came as quite a surprise to me. The picture is amazing; simply brilliant with a really spectacular job in both editing and camera work which makes the DVD just so enjoyable to watch.\n\nThe sound is unbelievable; one of the best concert recordings I've come across, the concert boasts one of the greatest live drum sounds ever captured, with a huge `feel the air particles moving,' kick drum sound, a clear sharp snare sound and perfectly mixed cymbals. I have a few DVDs where rock bands play with an orchestra and I honestly believe this concert implemented the idea the best, working to augment the material instead of dominating it.\n\nThe stage looks fantastic and the lighting is really impressive, giving the whole show a really epic atmosphere, appropriate during material like the `Howling at the Moon,' section of `Magnum Opus,' or the very grand `Miracles Out of Nowhere.'\n\nThen on top of all that, the tracklisting is excellent, paying particular focus to the classic era; all the fan favourites are here from radio legends `Point of Know Return,' `Dust In The Wind,' and `Carry On Wayward Son,' to prog masterpieces like `Song For America,' `Cheyenne Anthem,' and `Icarus: Borne on Wings Of Steel.'\n\nThe bands performance throughout is amazing, from the incredibly intricate drumming on the proggier numbers, to the soulful singing on the ballads Steve Walsh's vocal performance on `The Wall,' is pretty breathtaking and all that before even considering the violin work. Take that into account then remember there's a top notch symphony orchestra and guest performances from Kansas veterans Kerry Livgren and Steve Morse and you can just imagine what a spectacle this 35th Anniversary gig really was.\n\nThe Bonus Track, an extended version of the classic `Down The Road,' recorded in the soundcheck is particularly energetic and impressive.\n\nIf you enjoy concert DVDs or are a Kansas fan then you can't afford to be without `There's Know Place Like Home,' in terms of performance, picture and sound this is simply one of the best DVDs out there.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Thrice continues to make spectacular music even after they went on hiatus to focus on family life. The band is known for experimenting a bit past the typical post-hardcore sound, and that is something that you get with this disc. From this being a bar none politically and socially aware album to the point where one of the songs on here, \"Whistleblower\", is about Edward Snowden (a guy often labeled as a whistleblower in politics), to the fact that lyrically and musically the band still keeps the unique side of them alive and well, this is an album that truthfully brings Thrice back into the world without attempting to recreate any one album and just let it be that. Tracks such as \"The Window\", \"Black Honey\", \"Wake Up\", and \"Blood On The Sand\" exhibit how well this album goes over. Even at its weakest, this is still, once again, a must hear album. Only better things are expected out of this band in the future.\n\nRating: 87\/100","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"After a seven year absence, it was going to be interesting to see what The Wallflowers came up with on their new release. 2005's REBEL, SWEETHEART had pretty much divided fans down the middle, while both of frontman Jakob Dylan's solo efforts (2008's SEEING THINGS and WOMEN + COUNTRY in 2010) met with critical and (to a lesser degree) commercial success.\n  Well, GLAD ALL OVER sort of follows it's own path...more organic than REBEL, nowhere near as introspective as WOMEN, with only a hint of the acoustic core that anchored THINGS, the band's sixth release is it's own little animal.\n  This is both a good and a bad thing. Certainly no one can accuse the group of jumping on the hit wagon, trying to follow the likes of Maroon 5, Train and Matchbox Twenty in landing the latest dance\/pop hit, be it self-penned or from an outside source.\n  But there's also an unfocused quality to a lot of the disc that ends up leaving it feeling hollow and uninspired in spots. Also, after the intimate one\/two punch of SEEING THINGS and WOMEN + COUNTRY, one can't help but wonder if Dylan is really meant to sing rock...yes, the heart is there, but as things get amped up, it becomes quite clear that his vocals are somewhat limited.\n  Things start off strongly, with the edgy, almost frantic, \"Hospital For Sinners.\" The track just thunders along, powered by a tight arrangement and whip-smart instrumentation (special kudoes to Rami Jaffee's keyboards!). Add a strong lead vocal from Dylan and you have a nice little album opener.\n  \"Misfits And Lovers\" also has a cool groove to it ~ how can you NOT love the handclaps-as-percussion and lines like \"It's not glass or the wires at our feet\/That gets us dancing this way\" ~ but, after repeated listens, something just seems to be missing. We'll call this one a draw.\n  There's a dreamy quality to \"First One In The Car\" that expertly blends the depth of Dylan's solo work with the band's rock roots. Toss in vivid lyrics (\"You're changing your clothes in the back seat you slip\/From a girl into a woman in less than a minute\") and you have one of GAO's top tracks.\n  The same can't be said about \"Reboot The Mission\"...if this is supposed to be an homage to The Clash (complete with guest vocals from Mick Jones), it's only partially successful. There's just something calculated and almost phoney about the cut. I gotta say, I think it was a huge mistake releasing this as the first single. Not one of GLAD's better moments.\n  Far superior is \"It's A Dream\"...there's a hypnotic quality to this dark tale that is both captivating and chilling. Strong instrumentation (love the piano!) supports an ominous lead vocal, as Dylan practically spits out foreboding lyrics: \"I can hear I can hear them chanting in the woods\/On their hind legs walking on little swine hooves.\" Brilliant.\n  Equally as strong, but for totally different reasons, is \"Love Is A Country.\" Relaxed and loose, this mid-tempo rocker lopes along at a vigorous pace. The song could have easily fit on WOMEN + COUNTRY, yet it has an unmistakable Wallflowers vibe to it. Another absolute gem!\n  There's a new wave energy to \"Have Mercy On Him Now\" that is down right infectious. Anchored by Jack Irons' break neck drumming, the instrumentation rolls along, while Dylan's vocal bobs and weaves over and around the lyrics. Add some rowdy backing vocals and you have yet another winner.\n  There's also a edgy groove to \"The Devil's Waltz.\" However, it only partially works this time...the handclaps, Jaffee's manic piano, the almost tribal beat...it all just seems a bit too much. We've heard this song on pretty much every previous Wallflowers album, and to better effect. Gotta call this one a miss.\n  Unfortunately, I kind of feel the same way about \"It Won't Be Long (Till We're Not Wrong Anymore\"). Opening with the great lines \"You said the words I want to hear\/They don't begin with the letter I\", the song then proceeds to go nowhere. I can't help but wonder what the track would have sounded like if they had just done it as an acoustic ballad. We'll call this one a \"Could've been\" miss.\n  The same can be said about the hit-and-miss \"Constellation Blues.\" The lyrics are lovely ~ \"The angels that used to be guarding our beds\/Have all wandered off and left us instead\" ~ but the arrangement and vocal just don't work for the song. Once again, I just can't help but wonder what a more stripped-down groove would have sounded ~ and felt ~ like.\n  Things end on a strong note with the shimmering \"One Set Of Wings.\" A delicate, yet powerful, arrangement, heartfelt lead vocal and strong lyrics (\"Don't be secret to me now\/Are you roses or burial ground\") all come together perfectly.\n  So...is GLAD ALL OVER worth the seven year wait? Overall, I would have to say \"yes.\" Granted, there are a couple of things I'd like to see in the future...the group working with a stronger producer (say, T-Bone Burnett), Dylan pushing himself more vocally...but the fact remains....The Wallflowers are a unique rock band, and with fewer and fewer of those around, it's good to have them back. (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics).","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Fans are so fickle because they expect the super hit, but this record has good songs throughout (no bad ones).  They are returning to rock after a short jaunt into country that was not accepted.  They lost their name, and now they are trying to move into mainstream rock.  They have exceeded even some of their early albums that were hit oriented rather than quality.  Eventually this album will be recognized for the wonderful songs that never get old.  The band is recovering from the forces that would take them away from what they are good at, and I'm sure some of the band members also are questioning the direction they're going now.  Sometimes it's a step process, and this was a very good first step.  I've listened to these songs over and over, and only then do you appreciate the effort that went into making them.  Highly recommended for anyone who is coming to the 3 Doors the first time.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"This is a great follow on from the 2001 hit album 'Silver Side Up', which this album develops on and makes a better sound, better melodies and better lyrics; which give the album the push to make it one of the great albums of the 00's. The tunes are heart-stopping, which 'Figured You Out' having a great guitar intro, and the melodic follow on 'Should've Listened' makes the album much better than their first effort, 'Silver Side Up', which fit the time well. The fast paced album opener 'Flat On the Floor' is an eye opener, with a constant drum bashing and guitar mashing being the centerpiece of the whole song. The vocals are riveting, with great lyrics to go with Chad Kroeger's mind-blowing singing voice; which is very distinct. 'Someday', 'Believe It Or Not', 'Because Of You' and 'Another Hole In The Head' keep the album interesting with guitar pounding anthems, drum fills and great vocals by Chad Kroeger. They all have their strong points but not many weak points that people can pick at and criticise this great album. The extra bonus tracks are killer. Great cover of 'Saturday Night's...' which is nearly as good as the original. 'Learn The Hard Way' is a great song which has distinctly editted vocals which gives the song a different direction to move in, which is good. 'Yanking Out My Heart' also has a distinct repetitive gutiar rhythm which is the only song on the album, that lets it down.","classification":5,"fold":8}

From the Jackson 5's first No. 1 (\"I want you back\" when Michael was eleven) through his untimely death at the age of fifty.\n\nI was still in high school when Michael and his brothers released four consecutive No. 1s (something not even the Beatles did). Despite Michael's popularity, I remained essentially a casual fan. I didn't buy a Michael Jackson album until THRILLER--an album that spawned seven hit singles and has sold over 100 million copies to date.\n\nI eventually bought 1995's HIStory and later 2001's GREATEST HITS. But if you're looking for one collection to hit all the highlights of a brilliant career (I bought mine as a Black Friday deal), this is everything the casual fan needs:  solo hits starting with 1971's \"Got To Be There\" through 1999's \"You Rock My World\" along with a sprinkling of Jackson 5\/Jacksons hits. [The only glaring omissions are the duets with his sister Janet (\"Scream\") and Paul McCartney (\"Say Say Say\")]\n\nOverall, this is two and a half hours of music that changed the landscape of popular music forever.

{"text":"Upon listening to \"Pierdo El Control\" by Elastic Bond the first thought that may arise is the very rhythmic and retro Latin-Bossanova tone of the song that stands out more than anything even if one may not understand the lyrics.  And the other parts of the song that no doubt cannot be ignored, the upbeat 1960's style of instrumentation that includes a soft trumpet from David Burgos and subtle keyboards and the wispy vocals of singer Sofy Encanto.  And by the end of the song, lightly quick guitar riff from guitarist Buffalo Brown offers a bit of mystery that is much reminiscent of a sound track from a James Bond or Austin Powers film.\n\nAnd for listeners interested in extending their summer playlist, \"Pierdo El Control\" may be a refreshing song to add to one's listening pleasure, especially during a hot summer night.","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"Some groups, such as Chevelle, don't change their style much over the course of their career and still manage to stay interesting. Breaking Benjamin are not one those groups. The first three albums should some growth and promise, but on Dear Agony and now this disc, theyve become more copy\/paste. Several songs on both discs sound too much like songs they had done on previous discs. I had hope that entirely new lineup behind Burley would bring some inspiration and vigor to the band's sound. Instead, it feels like the other members are merely pawns. I will continue to hold out hope that on the next effort, the other band members can help steer the band in a bit of new creative direction, rather than merely recycling what's been done. Like I said, the problem isn't the keeping of their core sound, it's that Ben isn't doing enough to keep it interesting in my opinion.","classification":2,"fold":8}

But whats really special is this womans' voice - so perfectly suited for this material. As a fan from the start of her career I know how versatile she is. Here she sings with authority and with the technique of a jazz legend. For us fans who have been waiting for new material from Debby for years this is just what the doctor ordered. This cd is perfect for a night of romance with fine wine and Boones' beautiful vocals washing over you. The production has class written all over it from the players to Debby Boone. Looking forward to the live show - it will rock! Congratulations Debby and thanks for keeping your music and your life real. God Knows :).....postscript - i was lucky enough to catch Debbys' live show at Scullers in Boston 6\/22\/05 and she truly charmed and dazzled her audience.

{"text":"This album is OUTSTANDING.  Why in the hell are we not hearing more about these guys???!!!!  Terry Kath Chicago fans UNITE!  CTA is the REAL deal, and the new songs fit well and show this group has fantastic potential. With all the hubbub about the latest release of Chicago's \"lost\" Stone of Sisyphus, I think I'm going to puke.  The reviews for SOS all sound like old fans trying to convince themselves that SOS is the best since the Terry Kath days and that they should be excited and happy.  It might be best, but it is still a gigantic cry from that early magic. Chicago since Terry Kath's passing and even the \"transitional\" Alive Again album is a completely different band and should have changed their name.  All the blues and grit from the early days has continued to be replaced with slick production, synthesizers, and seriously stripped down guitar.  California Transit Authority DOES have that early magic, and I hope and pray they can continue to create and perform.  The WORD must get out. And before you get the idea these guys are just an old Chicago cover band, forget it!  They add their own spice and the new songs show they are every bit as inovative and appealing.  Be prepared to be blown away.\n\nIt is truly tragic that Pankow, Loughnane, Parazaider, and Lamm are not a part of Danny's new adventure. The songs are polished, the sound is GREAT, and, if they are honest with themselves, as musicians (with any personality conflicts set aside), I would imagine they would be crying inside not having been part of this wonderful project.\n\nWhen I first heard that the brass sound on the tracks was done on keyboard, I thought it would sound nothing but cheesy.  NO WAY.  No way at all.  In fact, when I listen to the tracks, I cannot tell the difference except on 25 or 6 to 4 which, I believe, was done live.  I can easily imagine that Pankow, Loughnane, and Parazaider made the studio sessions in secret, but due to contractual obligations, they are not credited. Wouldn't that be a gas?!  Anyway, time will tell if the band can pull off some new tunes that equal or surpass Pankow's inovative big brass sound.\n\nThe new musicans really, really cook!!!  Marc Bonilla is fantastic find.  Though no one can replace Kath, Bonilla has his own magic and the playing is phenomenal. He definitely HAS the down and dirty blues.  Larry Braggs from Tower of Power is a perfect fit for the group. All the other musicans are just great, and they play tight.\n\nOne more comment.  I already knew that Danny was a rock drum genius, but this album makes it painfully clear he was an extremely essential ingredient to the early Chicago sound.\n\nIf you like the Terry Kath Chicago, this is an absolute must buy.  RIGHT NOW!","classification":5,"fold":8}

Pretty standard stuff for the most part, with a few stand-outs.\nOf the symphonies, The Bells is especially nice, with the added bonus of being performed in English; that alone is worth a dollar. Symphonic Dances is also quite good. I have the Hughes set of #1,2 & 3, of which 1 & 2 are kind of bland, though 3 in nice. Slatkin does a bit better here with those.\nOf the concertos, the 1st is actually kind of exciting. The 2nd is, well, the 2nd, really not much anyone can do at this point to make it interesting. The 3rd is pretty good and Ms. Simon does the standard cadenza, so it was interesting to hear that for a change. The 4th is also nicely done. Ms. Simon's playing isn't flashy, it's clean and precise, always welcome traits. I did hear her humming at least once.\nIf you don't already have these works, this set is a good set; even if you do, they make a good addition to your collection","classification":4,"fold":8}

She got married to her longtime beau Jay-Z, and hard to believe her songs actually got better with age. That actually is true with her latest ballad If I Were A Boy, the first single from her 3rd album I Am... Sasha Fierce, is actually her most-heartfelt ballad yet. The song speaks a more meaningful message about learning from the heartaches and the losses of love, with understanding about what a woman wants, if was in a man's shoes, and the other way around. Unlike other songs she has recorded on her own, this is one that doesn't feel cheesy and flavor of the moment. I don't know why Beyonce' has made songs like this one in her solo efforts.

{"text":"After staging arguably the biggest musical comeback this side of Tina Turner with her dance-driven project BELIEVE, Cher's back three years on to offer up more of the same with LIVING PROOF.Utitlizing many of the same producers, she attempts to build on the momentum experienced with the previous set, and the end result is an overall more consistent album.  Granted, there's nothing here that matches the instant pleasure of 'Believe' or 'All or Nothing', but there's also nothing here that matches the abundance of filler found on BELIEVE either. Lyrically, the tracks follow similarly in the vein of her eighties' corporate-rock albums than her more recent output. The set's first international single, 'The Music's No Good Without You',seems an odd choice, if only because it isn't one of the albums more ingratiating tunes.  Far better is 'Alive Again', as well as 'A Different Kind Of Love Song' and 'Real Love'. Also interesting is 'You Take It All', an electronica-driven track that sounds like Cher trying to channel Olive or Dido.  Among the very few missteps are the sole ballad 'Rain Rain', which is just plain dull, as well as a pedestrian remake of 'When The Money's Gone'. The only other minor quibble is the use of the dreaded vocoder on nearly all the tracks--it sounded cool the first thousand times we heard 'Believe', but has since been rendered just another tired, over-utilitzed gimmick--her voice is better than ever, and the heavy reliance on vocal effects just detracts from the album's overall impact after several listens. Though it doesn't match her underrated nineties opus IT'S A MAN'S WORLD as her best, it is a superior album to BELIEVE and reinforces the notion that Cher sounds best when she supresses the rock chick and unleashes her inner dance diva.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"To categorize \"Defeated No More\" as simply electronic and\/or dance (or any other existing category) would be to understate the sheer novelty of the music.  The slow and steady tempo helps to keep the song from seeming overly long at six minutes, but that's not the only thing that keeps it from seeming like a song that lasts too long.  The song has a very unique and original sound, with new-age accents thrown in here and there.  It is fascinating, and it makes you want to hear what's going to happen next.  Although the song lasts for six minutes, the time seems to fly by, as you get lost in the music.\n\nThe song is very laid-back, but the insistent rhythmic thumping of the padded bass drum pedal calls you to dance.  The percussions also include clapping (or keyboards made to sound like clapping), which is a good technique for engaging an audience.  To cap it off, the cymbals are played with brushes rather than drum sticks.  As the brush hits the cymbal, it has the effect of softening and diffusing that sharply precise <TWACK> that is more typically produced by drummers using drum sticks.\n\nThe vocals are interesting, too.  The message in the lyrics matches the style of the music quite well.  The song is about a woman who broke up with a man and hurt him badly, and she wants to get back together.  Instead of allowing her to see that she still has an effect on him, he is taking it slow and easy, and allowing the fire to build back up, while always maintaining control of his emotions to see if she is capable of committing to him.  Both of the brothers have very pleasant voices, and one of them is even able to maintain the quality of his voice in the falsetto range.\n\nI'm so amazed this was offered as part of a free promotion!  Thank you!  Extremely highly recommended!","classification":5,"fold":8}

{"text":"\"Human\" is so aptly titled that you would think that Brandy's reading our minds.  As most of the tracks feel like something that i've gone through myself or something a friend has experienced.  Either way it makes for an outstanding 5th release for her.\n\nI personally bought the Itunes (Deluxe Version) of the cd.  I've been down and a fan of hers since the very first song with her voice and singing that has only gotten stronger since her previous \"unappreciated\" last album \"Afrodisiac\".  She hits back even harder with \"Human\" and there so many highlights abound on this cd that I could see them releasing singles off of it well into the end of 2009.\n\nFrom the first track released \"Right Here (Departed)\" with her reuniting with her longtime producer Rodney Jerkins his efforts are felt throughout the cd.  To the second single \"Long Distance\" it is made very clear that Brandy is bringing out all the cards on this effort.  Also various tracks of note and very worthy of release include:\n\n\"The Definition\"\n\"Warm It Up (With Love)\"\n\"Piano Man\"\n\"Camouflage\"\n\"Torn Down\"\n\"Human\" (very personal and heartfelt co-written by Brandy)\n\"Shattered Heart\"\n\"True\" (another one that you really feel the singing on) really all of them though have that effect)\n\"A Capella (Something Missing)\"\n\"1st & Love\"\n\"Fall\"\n\nThese tracks are extras\/features on the Itunes version:\n\"Locket (Locked in Love)\" excellent track\n2 mixes of \"Right Here (Departed)\"\n\"Long Distance (A capella)\"\nPlus the video for \"Right Here (Departed)\n\nI am personally buying the cd for myself as well.  Plus i will end up getting it for someone else as well.  I'm letting everyone know that B-rocka is back and this album should not be slept on at all.\n\nExcellent album \"Human\" makes me feel good about being who I am and living my life on my own terms not someone else's.\n\n5\/5 all over the board.  Excellent vocal (different runs and variations) and just great control in all aspects.  The writing is well handled by a variety of songwriters and Brandy writes on a few herself.  Production is solid and gives B a chance to her thing on each and every song.  Also nice variety and placement of the uptempo and ballads they aren't all bunched together so it doesnt slow the album down.  Plus length of the album in whatever version you buy is great as well.\n\n\"Human\" is destined to be one of those albums talked about for the remainder of '08 and well into '09.","classification":5,"fold":8}

But on my turntable, this album smokes.

I love the Martha & the Vandellas hit of the song, Laura Nyro with Labelle's more a cappella version and Dusty Springfield's masterful take, but Bonnie Pointer and this band cannot be denied. \"I Can't Help Myself,\" \"Jimmy Mack\" and \"Come See About Me\" may be familiar songs, but Pointer moves them along to another level.

{"text":"American VI:  Ain't No Grave is (at least we're being told) the last installment of Johnny Cash's recordings produced by Rick Rubin.  With American V Cash's recordings had taken on a dark and somber tone both musically and lyrically, and some fear that this new collection would be even further down that path.  However Ain't No Grave has the overall tone of someone who is a peace with his impending passing.  This is shines through the most on \"I Corinthians 15:55\" where the chorus draws from the Bible passage \"O Death, where is thy sting?\/O Grave, where is thy victory?\".\n\nCash also took the opportunity on these songs to remember positive relationships as on \"For The Good Times\" and \"Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound\".  Both of these songs have simple, but bright acoustic backing.\n\nIn contrast I found it interesting that even though \"Ain't No Grave\" and \"Redemption Day\" have positive lyrics; they have very deep bass notes on the piano and\/or guitar that have a dark and ominous feel to them.  This makes for an interesting contrast rather than contradiction.\n\nAin't No Grave concludes with the Hawaiian song \"Aloha Oe\" which translates to \"Farewell to you\".  Even though Cash departed this world some six plus years ago, it was his wish for this song to be the closer of his final CD.  Yet it is not meant as a sad goodbye as the lyrics include \"Until we meet again.\"\n\nThe instrumentation - most notably provided by Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench of The Heartbreakers - is skillfully done yet never overpowers Cash.  The production is simple so that listeners will not be distracted from what Cash had to offer in his final recordings.\n\nOverall, Ain't No Grave is a testament to a legend who knew his end was near.  His vocals reflect that his health was in decline; however, he by no means embarrassed himself.  This collection of songs is a fitting posthumous tribute to Cash's faith and the peace that it afforded him.  Yes, Johnny, farewell to you, until we meet again.\n\nDownload this:  I Corinthians 15:55","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"Joe Satriani releases his fifteenth album and it is a sonic onslaught of excellent guitar riffs and melodies backed up by some amazing musicians who really bring life to these interesting songs. Produced by Joe Satriani and John Cuniberti, Shockwave Supernova features brilliant musical performances from the likes of Vinnie Colaiuta and Marco Minnemann on drums, Bryan Beller and Chris Chaney on bass, and Mike Keneally on keyboards and additional guitars. As you can tell, with musicians like that backing you up you're in for a real treat as far as instrumental ear candy is concerned. What makes this album really good though is the song ideas that Joe Satriani has come up with. I really feel like it's one of the more memorable albums of his recent career with lots of interesting ideas and grooves. Highlights include the wicked opening track \"Shockwave Supernova\", the moody vibe of \"Crazy Joey\", the brilliantly layered chorus of \"In My Pocket\", the soothing melodies of \"All Of My Life\", and the killer lead runs of \"Stars Race Across The Sky\". Expectations are always high with an artist as legendary as Joe Satriani but Shockwave Supernova is certainly one of his best albums in a while and the fact that he's surrounded himself with amazing musicians is just helping to make his ideas sound even more exciting.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"It is honestly and absolutely so sad whenever someone whom is young and talented has thrown their voice away by making poor decisions in their music, they are just not worth it. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles is one of those singers that has really been more of a product, than a actual songstress of the heart. It is just so sad, because the more stunts she has pulled, or the more she is severely overplayed like Michael Jackson was, the more her songs are not worth listening to anymore. It is sad. Flawless has been one of those songs to where she is trying ti be more street than really rap alone, and tragically she has not been able to deliver around the voice alone. I personally found this song to be just as wasted as when she tried to deliver on rap with songs like Video Phone and Diva from her I Am... Sasha Fierce. Overall, if you are a die hard fan or new to Beyonce' Knowles music, I would suggest you pass this song up, and go to her songs when she was a part of Destiny's Child, or play Crazy In Love to death.\n\nSong: D-","classification":2,"fold":8}

According to press releases, the project was inspired by the election  of Barack Obama as President.\n\nThe major  standout on this Grammy caliber project is the musicianship. The Roots' drummer , \"?uestlove\" is the time keeper through and through.  Canadian recording artist , Melanie Fiona and Common take a guest spots on the title track. Vocally,  that track is nowhere near what Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes  (with Teddy Pendergrass) did with it. But, it is impressive.

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library.  With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing.  It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.  Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon.  Thats right!  Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too.  In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.  Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great!  At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE SONGS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free\n\nFREE ALBUMS:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Albums by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":8}

At first listen, I could hear the purity and the many dimensions of that VOICE, which is soothing, smooth like 18 year old Appleton, seductive, and playful. Kem is not your ordinary run of the mill singer but an extraordinary song stylist. His voice dips and dives, rounds syllables (much like Al, Anita, & Phyllis), scats, and just downright croons.\nAfter getting ahold of Kemistry I was not dissappointed, rather joyous of the fact that I owned a solid musical experience. This is adult music at its finest. The ambience is intimate and jazzy. The instrumentation is also complimentary to Kem's vocal prowess. There are also nice percussive elements that add to the vibe of the cd. My favs are \"Love Calls, Brotha Man (lyrics are beautiful), Inside, and This Place.\"\nThere's not much else for me to say about this product other than get this cd.","classification":4,"fold":8}

{"text":"I'd like to give a more in depth, track specific, review, but honestly I had such lack of motivation to listen to this that I've only heard it 3 or 4 times all the way through.  I tried a few others but could never make it through.\n\nIf you're looking for a Primal Fear album full of PF cliches, recycled riffs, recycled melodies and filler tracks which will have you running for albums like Jaws Of Death and Black Sun then this is for you.  NONE of these songs are worth being recorded.  Granted there isn't 1 terrible song on here but there isn't a single good song on here either, hence the 1 star rating.  It's all filler.  the last album was bad but at least there were 3 or 4 songs I really liked.  this one doesn't have any I can even remember except Rulebreaker which might be sadly the highlight.  It's probably good for a filler song but that's about it.  When they try to change things up they basically put movie trailer music as the intro to an overly long song \"We Walk Without Fear\" and call that progress.  I mean seriously I expected to hear the movie trailer guy talking over it saying things like \"Coming..  July.. 31st..  Get.. Ready..  For..  Action\" followed by a list of actors or some variation.  I don't think they do those trailers anymore actually.\n\nI'm not saying Primal Fear needs to be anything other than what they are.  Sure some experimentation would be nice, but they don't have to stop being a power metal band or anything, but they need to stop using the same riffs, melodies, and drum beats and try to write something that's actually good.  But this will please the people who only want the same stuff over and over and don't care if a band puts effort into creating a good album or releases another stale boring release.  I like these guys I really do.  I like most songs on all of their albums from the self titled through Unbreakable, but I feel they've gotten too comfortable and no one, no producers and certainly not the fans, are pushing them to do better.","classification":1,"fold":8}

{"text":"Let me put this straight: the Strokes were not that good and I did not like them. So if you don't agree with this, do not read any further. It is true that they appeared at a time which was a low ebb for rock in general. But it was mainly their looks and attitude that made the impact. Their recorded output has been pretty small and of irregular quality. Even Is This It is not a masterpiece. Their recorded output has been marred by a sloppy sludgy sound and missing bite iin thier attitude. This impression of boredom also permeates the first solo record by Julian Casablancas. The cover of the record is ultra-weird, with all these red colors additionally to the HMV dog (what's his name again) together with a phonograph: he is on EMI, get it? Julian Casablancas also stares blankly at us and the record conveys this blank impression. As I wrote the production is not good and the sound really muddy. He has added keyboards this time (on french TV he had a pretty keyboard player at least) but they can barely be hard to great effect. Also there are no real tunes and he sounds bored. At least Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers knew how to be bores but still have that added \"je ne sais quoi\" that made them great:now there was a great NY rock band. This is the cheap version. Even Television was better.\nWhile 11th dimension is clearly the best song, it is not great: it starts really well but then instead of winding up it suddenly gets caught in a boring groove. Sad to say guys but this is not a good record.","classification":1,"fold":8}

{"text":"This is the first album without Mick Taylor, and it shows. To use the title of one of their tunes from the Goats album, Black and Blue continued the mid-70s trend of the Rolling Stones \"Coming Down Again\" from the glorious heights of their '68-'72 Classic peaks. B&B is simply an uneven, if not amateurish performance, by a group touted as World's Greatest ROCK & ROLL Band.\n\nThis album has much more of a NON-rock & roll style. \"Hot Stuff\" is funky; reggae is evident with \"Cherry Oh Baby\"; and \"Melody\" is a little jazzy. Tellingly, only one song from B&B managed to (barely) crack the US Top Ten, and wasn't even a Rock and Roll number (Fool to Cry).\n\nNo, this can arguably be considered a low point in the Stones' output from the '70s, especially considering that Ron Wood was still testing out his wings here as a new band member. The album DID manage to score some notable PR for the infamous Hollywood billboard in which a Jagger-bound young model was shown to say\n\n\"I'm BLACK AND BLUE from the Rolling Stones -- and I love it!\"\n\nThe resulting firestorm from feminist groups probably added to sales of the album, despite the mediocrity of the tracks. The lads from London thus continued their notorious streak of controversy for being \"Bad Boys.\"\n\nOne last thing....\n\nJust wanted to make some corrections on reviewer Jarchow's comment \"Billy Preston -- who by the way is the ONLY musician to have played on both a Beatles recording, and a Stones recording\"\n\nTechnically incorrect.\n\n-- The incomparable English pianist Nicky Hopkins played on numerous Stones' recordings, and on one or more Beatles recordings (e.g., \"Revolution\" from the White Album).\n\n-- Guitar great Eric Clapton played lead ax on The Beatles \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" and recorded with Keith Richards and John Lennon on the tune \"Yer Blues\" for the Rolling Stones Rock & Roll Circus in 1968.\n\nMore technically correct, but still historically interesting, are the following:\n\n-- One of the Stones played on a Beatles recording. Appropriately, this was Rolling Stones founder and talented multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, who played alto saxophone on the B side of the Beatles' last single \"Let it Be.\" The recording is a comedy-lounge tune called \"You Know My Name (look up the number).\" Jones was part of the recording sessions with the Beatles in early April 1967 for this composition.\n\n-- One of the Beatles played on a Stones recording. That honor goes to none other than John Lennon, who jammed with Keith Richards (and Clapton, as mentioned above) on the Beatles tune \"Yer Blues\" for the Stones' 1968 Circus.\n\n-- Head Stones Jagger and Richards joined the Beatles in recording their 1967 release \"All You Need is Love.\"\n\n-- Lead Beatles Lennon and McCartney joined the Stones in recording their 1967 release \"Sing This All Together.\"","classification":2,"fold":8}

{"text":"I really did not want to check this album out, but I did anyway to see if this band would be a little better after the atrocity that was \"A War You Cannot Win\", and would show musical evolution. Unfortunately, this album is yet another clunker in the ATR cabinet, but unlike their past efforts, there are at least a few small baby steps taken forward into the right direction. However, judging by the fact that frontman Phil Labonte is a complete backwards moron as evidenced last month when he stated his ridiculous views on the LGBT, this album is still pretty much musical surstromming.\n\nThe tracks on this band where the band at least attempts to make for better change are \"Divide\" and even \"A Reason For Me To Fight\", and that's really about it. The rest of the album is not much different from their other albums. You have tracks on here such as \"No Knock\", \"Victory Lap\", and \"Pernicious\", which sound like songs that are carbon-copied from past albums, albeit with a much more technical side which doesn't mean jack. And of course on a majority of these, the frontman really does a good job at showcasing his horrendous high screaming vocals. Now, these screams are not as infuriating as they were on their last album, but it still is irritating and monotonous when they can be. But, it's not just his vocals this time around, it's really the fact that he's singing these songs in general. A good example of this is \"Tru-KVLT-Metal\", which is supposed to be a song attacking metal purists and elitists which is a good message indeed, because some of these people are absolutely stupid. But, it's ruined by the fact that this is the band performing it. A band who has claimed that they are \"transcending metal\", when really, they're not all that impressive.\n\nI guess one positive I can say about this is that the backing band did step up their talent. The drumming is a lot faster on this album, and Mike and Oli show that they have some talent when it comes to shredding. However, everyone involved with this album is roped to mediocrity, which really makes it worthless. You can make an album that is very technical, and is \"hard to play\" on drums, and it can still be a heavily misguided and off-putting record, and this album is no exception to that rule.\n\n\"The Order Of Things\" is once again the latest goose egg in the All That Remains catalogue, and is one that I can only recommend to die-hard fans of ATR who will go out and buy anything that the band has ever put out. Like I said, they did at least try to not make this album a bad one, and for all intents and purposes this is not as bad as their past albums, but it still doesn't escape past one star in my opinion. If you want an ATR album that is actually good, then listen to \"Behind Silence And Solitude\", which is actually a solid disc. Otherwise, let this album collect dust.\n\nRating: 15\/100","classification":1,"fold":8}
