{"text":"Granted, while I'm proud of Trey Songz for scoring a #1 album on the Billboard Top-200, this album has to be my least favorite of his.  The album has high points, Trey continues his traditional sexy sound with songs like: Dive In, Panty Wetter, and Heart Attack.  There are songs on the album like that deal with personal pain\/failed love: Fumble (my fav), Bad Decisions, Without A Woman, and Pretty Girl's Lie are promising tracks.  The only negative, when I listened to 'Ladies Go Wild' -- I heard this electronic-dance sound coming through my speakers.  Not to say electronic-pop is bad, but there are certain artists and genres who should leave it to other artists to mess with.  The reason why I loathe it is because other favorites of mine--Usher and Chris Brown--have made their home too much in that sound, which have somewhat made them abandon their R&B roots (hope Trey isn't following the same path).  Overall the album mixed in my book.  The lyrical content isn't as strong as 'Ready' or 'PP&P'.  Trey's voice is still pretty good as usual and makes several of the songs work in his favor because of it.  The features with T.I., Young Jeezy, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne are favorable.\n\nRating - 3.5\/5.0","classification":3}

{"text":"This cd is great, and the only reason it is 4 not 5 stars is because most of this material is a rehash from his first cd \"dog years\" which was a superior performance in my opinion.  However, the new material that is on here is great and some of it even better than what was on the first disc.  Listen to the whiffle ball Tony bit and try not to laugh your butt off.  Also, Mike is a rather clean comic with very little bad language or sexual jokes.  Enjoy.","classification":4}

{"text":"This is the first Slipknot album I've purchased since their debut (wasn't a fan). Since it got good reviews and I'm a metal guy I decided to give it a shot. It's unlike anything else they've ever done, in that it's meticulously arranged with outstanding production. There are humongous drums, machine gun riffs, and deep throated vocals, along with some really nice harmonies and guitar solos. This is easily the strongest work they've put out. In the past I've snickered as Corey compared themselves to Metallica, but I would say they have delivered something along the lines of \"Master of Puppets\" or \"Rust in Peace\". This will be the metric from which they're measured from here on out. Quite possibly their high water mark. If nothing else, they've proven they're capable of this kind of effort and the expectations will be higher.\n\nIf you dig metal, thrash, industrial, etc. You'll certainly like this album.","classification":5}

Outside of those elite female Blues Artists, Dani Wilde & Shannon Curfman are basically average though. Sue Foley & Samantha Fish just might be as equally exciting & influential of Artists in my wide female Blues collection despite Sue Foley being in the business nearly as long as Samantha Fish has been alive!

{"text":"Prime Cuts: Drop Your Stone, Find You to Find Me, Just the Same\n\nChris August's new album \"The Maker\" reads like a well-narrated autobiography where he does not just chronicle linearly and uneventfully his timeline of events.  Rather, he gives exposition at life's intersection between his own personal struggles and God's revelation of Himself through the pages of Holy Scripture.  As a result not only do we profit from the nuggets of truth August has had gleaned.  But we also get to stand with August in his shoes with his honest confessions of fear, doubt, and uncertainties.  \"The Maker\" came out of a doleful season of August's life after he had suffered from a skateboard accident and a long season of battling with depression.  Thus, the songs here exist not just for our entertainment.  Rather, they represent pearls of wisdom that will buffet our souls with holy delight as we put them on repeat on our iTunes.\n\nAugust came to the musical purview with his 2010's #1 hit \"Starry Nights.\"  Out of which came his debut album on WORD Records \"Not Far Away,\" which became a top 15 Christian album.  Even at the start of his career, August has never been one not to wear his heart on his sleeves.  From his debut record also came \"7x70,\" a song that he wrote as a response of forgiveness towards his parents' divorce when he was just 5 years-old.  Two albums down, August still bares his soul with this new record.  Most autobiographical is \"He's Still Here.\"  A throbbing hook-laden pop number that blisters with a polish of confidence, August here unwaveringly sings about God's abiding presence even in times when our feelings betray such a truth.\n\nOne of August's mettle as a top flight songwriter shows with \"Find You to Find Me.\"  Turning around the worldly adage that \"life begins when you find yourself,\" here August rightfully insists that life begins when we find God who then helps us find ourselves.  If you want a song with a pretty (and memorable) melodic line, look no farther than the ear-grabbing and heart-fluttering ode of grace, \"Just the Same.\"  \"Drop Your Name\" is a modern day retelling of the story in John 8 where Jesus teaches us not to condemn others because we first are wretched sinners ourselves.  Here, August shows that he is just as apt in penning a narrative-centered song.\n\nThe title cut \"The Maker\" calls to mind the hymn \"This is My Father's World,\" where August reminds us again that God is with us in all of creation.  Nevertheless, there's one line that needs to be brought to light.  Over the course of the song, August sings \"You are creation.\"  God is indeed the Creator who loves, abides, and cherishes His creation.  But nowhere in Scripture is God equated with creation.  To say God is creation is to say God is pantheistic, which is an erring heresy.  Other than this theological trip-up, \"The Maker\" is a well-told slice of autobiography narrated with heart, thought and melody.","classification":4}

The album ended sounding more like the Talking Heads than My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, but still has the virtues they created together in both working groups.  Strange Overtones is a perfect example with a cool dance floor groove and fairly representative of the lighter side of More Songs About Buildings and Food (which was my first Heads album and first exposure to production by Eno).

{"text":"Musically, \"SWAN SONGS\" is like someone took a blender and threw in sounds from Linkin Park, Beastie Boys, Eminem, Blink 182, and a few others, and out poured this graphic cocktail.  I say graphic, because the lyrics are very explicit (I like that), not for the weak.  But more importantly, they form Hollywood Undead's panorama of life in the dangerous yet alluring night world of L.A.  It's full of alcohol and drugs, sex and violence, anger and numbness, agony and ecstasy.  Sounds like fun, no?  So, what's the connection to the REAL undead?  Well, listen and you will hear the following references:\n\n\"...March to the drums of the damned...\" (Vampires are damned.)\n\n\"...With this blood on my hands, in this blood I am damned...\" (Blood is a vampire's tragic flaw.)\n\n\"Just let me burn...\" (One way to kill a vampire.)\n\n\".. this destiny, it goes on endlessly...\" (Vampires live forever.)\n\n\"I don't wanna be like this, I've been running the streets too long now...\" (Vampires are lonely, in despair.)\n\nAnd finally, \"Am I alive or dead?\" (Of course, they are Undead.)\n\nH.U. expresses a lot of youthful angst as well, as rock\/rap should.  The album as a whole, sucked up in one sitting, is really an engrossing experience which, incorporating all of the above, gets you into that L.A. life.  For those of us stuck out in the red states, it's the next best thing to actually being there...\n\nJust one more thing.

{"text":"There is nothing fancy, sophisticated or classy about Lemmy Kilmister but, in his own words, 'that's the way I like it baby, I don't want to live forever'. And so, whether you are a fan or not of him and his music, there is something fundamentally reassuring about the way in which he and Motorhead never seem to change. 'Motorizer' is as brutal and full of energy as any other Motorhead album over the years and if you've been a long term fan, you will simply lap this album up. Speaking however as someone that can appreciate the great man and his music rather than actually like a lot of it, I don't think that there are any individual tracks here to rival past glories such as 'Ace Of Spades', 'Bomber' or (my personal favourite) 'Killed By Death'. This said, 'The Runaround Man', 'Heroes' and the hilarious 'Rock Out' (with your cock out!) could all become favorites in time. That Lemmy and his band are still producing punishing, aggressive and 'dirty' rock and roll over 30 years into a musical career is a tribute to them and, let's face it, there's no-one that quite 'cranks up the volume' like Motorhead, is there? 'Motorizer' is a solid and consistent set, that delivers EXACTLY what you would expect it to.","classification":5}

{"text":"The Stylistics make moody soul music, atmospheric. There's also a hint of Warrick - Bacharach  in their music, well, after all they did cover \"You'll never get to if you break my heart\", and the joyous \"Make it last\" carries on in that vein.\n\nOther than that song, in my opinion this album doesn't really get going until the second half - the jazzy slow burn of \"Love comes easy\", the off-hand rock 'n' roll title track, the soul classic \"You make me feel brand new\" and the exuberant \"I won't give you up\".\n\nBut, the highlight for me is undoubtedly \"There's no reason\" with it's off-kilter melody, interesting arrangement and rolling chorus with the perfect vocal harmonies. Along with most of the other songs, the gentle, understated sound adds to the whole atmosphere.\n\nSongs like \"Only for the children\" and \"Could this be the end\" - I don't know. I've always thought Russell Thompkins Jr is at his best singing love songs, because it suits his vocal style than angrier songs. Overall I would give this album a 7, or three and a half.","classification":4}

{"text":"One of the key factors that made the late Ray Charles Robinson the musical icon he become in the two or three decades before his passing was the fact that,if blues came from the crossroads than Brother Ray was crossing the musical interaction. During his salad years of the late 50's\/early 60's there was hard bop jazz,urban electric blues and country\/western music all somehow playing on jukeboxes in black communities all over America. Ray Charles had reflected this all. Of course the foundation in all of this,if not overtly was the blues form. And considering,even on his later Atlantic days,Ray was beginning to deal with concept albums as a strong musical possibility. It would simply be the right musical choice to reflect his roots in the blues.\n\n  \"Early In The Mornin'\" and \"I'm Movin' On\" are the two major uptempo numbers here. The melodic form is right there,smack in the center of the 12-bar blues. Yet the rhythm is right out of that Afro-Latin vibe-with Ray's electric piano all making this an extension of the uptempo,funky soul sound he'd pioneered a couple of years earlier with \"What'd I Say\". \"The Right Time\",while nostalgically conjuring up that image of Rudy Huxtable in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Cosby-Show\/dp\/B00GOC74Z2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Cosby Show<\/a>&nbsp;is an elegant,chunky number full of Fathead Newman's growling sax and the Raelette's singing at their prime. Not to even mention Ray going from his strong vocal lead to impassioned cries at a moments notice.  \"I Believe In My Soul\" starts out with a rather Oriental sounding melody on the piano while Charles own compositions \"Hard Times (No One Knows Better Than I)\",\"The Midnight Hour\",\"Feelin' Sad\",'Ray's Blues\",\"Nobody Cares\",\"Mr. Charles Blues\",\"Some Day Baby\" and \"I Wonder Who\" are all mid to low tempo straight up piano based jazzy blues numbers.\n\n  With the recent passing of Crusaders pianist\/co-founder Joe Sample? I've come to think about how grateful music fans of my age group should really be that currently deceased  musical icons such as James Brown,Ray Charles and even someone as late in the game as Michael Jackson were still around during part of our lifetime. Many were musicians who played,some were masterful performs and some were both. But to people such as myself? They will not merely be a page in a history book. Even though this album was recorded almost twenty years before I was born? The strands of the new music I'd have absorbed as a child are ever present here. The really exciting part is Ray was an originator too-the key architect of the soul genre. And here he is in 1961-paying a vital musical tribute to a genre that he absorbed growing up. And so the cycle continues,and meets full circle. Pretty likely this is going to be one of the finest and most important albums you'll ever hear in your life!","classification":5}

{"text":"What an amazing album! It behoves me to say this but there is so much genre-locked country music out there, that genre-defying bands like The Mavericks are in the minority. We have been besieged by bland & uninteresting groups & singers whose albums lack life, spontaneity, adrenaline-driving music, & just plain good fun, for so long, that country music has become a stagnant oasis. Ok, change in style is good, and down through the years we have seen great changes in country music, but the last 5-10 years have been so boring. With exceptions like Toby Keith, Martina McBride, Dwight Yoakam, Trace Adkins & the like, the majority of today's country 'artists', are not really country at all - they are either pop cross-overs, or pop\/rock singers unable to make it in the world of rock music. And so much of their songs are like hand-me-downs from the 'Nashville Sound' era. So thank God we have The Mavericks! This Tex-Mex influenced band makes music to be enjoyed, music to dance to, music that makes you feel alive. And boy, do they do it with style. As a group, their presentation is flawless; this is a band that works, with each member complimenting one another & providing the perfect backing for Raul Malo's magnificent vocals. Damn, but the man CAN sing! And every song on the album gets 5 stars from me - there's not a bad track on the album, which is a lot more than can be said for many of the other country albums I've listened to this year. Can you imagine the likes of Keith Urban, Carrie Underwood, Taylor Swift, etc., etc., getting out of their comfort zones & trying to do an album that swings like this? I don't think so! I only hope that the radio stations & the country music shows will give these guys the time & exposure they deserve, so that everyone will get the chance to see & hear them. Welcome back guys, & thank you for the listening experience of the year.","classification":5}

{"text":"This is an excellent disc by Mary.  She is the undisputed queen of R and B music.  My favorite track is the duet \"Shake Down\" with Usher.  This song is about two people who love each other.  \"Talk To Me\" is about the importance of communication and trust in a relationship.  \"Grown Woman\" is another strong track on here.  This is a good song about the strength of a grown woman.  \"Work In Progress\" is my other favorite track.  This track reminds me that everyone is a work in progress. No one is perfect.  This track makes me feel good every time I listen to it.  \"Just Fine\" is an great track to dance and move to.  \"Come To Me\" and \"Hurt Again\" are two relaxing tracks.

{"text":"Now hear me when I say this, Annie Clark is one of my favorite songwriters around. I think she's one of the most beautiful and talented women alive today, but this record doesn't do it for me, I don't understand all the high ratings it's receiving, it's a three-star album at best. Let me start by saying I've been a fan of Annie's since before Actor came out. I've seen her live twice and both performances rank as my top favorite shows of all time, but I'm compelled to write an honest review of this record.\nThe great thing about Annie's music is her use of catchy hooks. For example \"Chloe in the Afternoon,\" \"Marry Me,\" Cruel... the list goes on and on. This album is almost entirely devoid of good hooks. As a musician I can appreciate the beautifully written string sections on the record, but if a good melody doesn't back it, what's the point? Another thing to note is that Annie doesn't really sound like herself on this album. On her prior three albums she uses a lot of head voice and falsetto, but this album is sung mostly in chest voice. The beautiful vocal timbre that we are used to hearing on a St. Vincent record, isn't there. And another noteworthy thing, is the lack of guitar work. One of the things that make Annie's music so unique is her guitar playing, but there's significantly less of it on this record.\n\nWith all that said, I understand, its not JUST a St. Vincent record, so naturally it shouldn't sound the same, but I still feel that it could have been way better.","classification":3}

{"text":"When it has came down to Nicki MInaj, she honestly has been more like a joke with her music, than taking her music t the next level. The songs that she had compiled for her album, The Pink Print have simply been more less of her persona, more of other rappers and entertainers, and sadly it has absolutely been a complete waste of time overall. Her latest collaboration which isn't enough of her, but mostly all of Drake isn't worth it. Truffle Butter isn't exactly one of her better songs. It overall shows Nicki has lost her voice and instead made a so-called A-List rapper into an absolute joke. I think the song is absolutely not only worth its money, but shows she honestly has run out of good songs to mix her own voice. Truffle Butter is absolutely not only a waste of time, but a song worth passing up. For someone who did Starships as a hit, she now has to find herself again.\n\nSong: F\n\n4,700th Review!!!!!!!!!!!!!","classification":1}

{"text":"I remember listening to this song on the radio when I was about 12 years old in '89, and being amazed at that note at the end of the song.  It still impresses me.\n\nThis is a really great power ballad from the '80s, with catchy\/memorable music, and touching lyrics about finding your true love\/soul mate, without being sappy.  I don't like overly romantic or mushy love songs, and this one manages to be lovely without crossing into embarrassing territory (at least for me).  I always thought it would be a good wedding song.  I haven't found anyone I feel that way about, or feels that way about me, but the song still sounds great to me.  One of my favorite '80s songs.","classification":5}

When you are really in love---and I mean REALLY in love---it's not something that just ends when you say \"It's over.\" The video especially illustrates how a part of that individual lingers around you like your favorite fragrance and you can't seem to shut it out, even though it might eventually fade.\n\nHeather's delivery of this song is so powerful even years after it was initially released because it speaks the truth that so many of us deny but know to be the case for us at one time or another. You can move on, but it doesn't mean you have to forget.","classification":5}

{"text":"To be honest, not a big Springfield fan.  Back in his hey day I really did get sick and tired of hearing 'Jessie's Girl' ten thousand times on the radio so that might have made me stay away from his releases.  I only have a couple of his earlier releases including 'Karma' from ions ago.  What sparked my interest on this was the album title plus the stellar reviews.  So, I gave the samples a listen and they all sounded intriguing.  At that point I decided to pick it up and after listening to this, make no mistake, this is a great album.  And my usual tastes lie in progressive rock, but I always enjoy some melodic rock from time to time and this doesn't disappoint by any means of the imagination.  I really can't say that there is a bad song on this album because there's not.  For fans of Springfield, nothing here disappoints and this could arguably be one of his finest efforts.  I picked up the expanded cd with bonus tracks 'Let Me In', 'Lust', 'Her Body Makes Vows' and a live rendition of McCartney's 'Jet'.  Great music all the way around.","classification":5}

However, there is something for everybody on this Listen because of the various artists featured on this cd (Sia Ryan Tedder, Emeli Sande, The Script, Bebe Rexha, Magic & Sonny Wilson etc.). I admit that I like the inclusion of his collaborations with other artists on Listen because of his previous tracks which are also collaborations; Whos That Chick (feat. Rihanna), Turn Me On (feat.

{"text":"Mastodon are in my opinion the absolute best metal band of their generation. I am such a big fan of these guys and of course I own all of their albums, they just never cease to blow my mind away. These guys no doubt just keep on putting out one phenomenal album after another with such incredibly amazing results. Their newest release, album six \"Once More 'Round the Sun\" is an amazingly mind blowing and phenomenal progressive metal tour de force that simply does not disappoint and is guaranteed to take you on a pure musical journey that will leave you breathless. Every song on this album is just filled with commanding yet melodic, powerful and soaring clean vocal attacks, fantastically mind boggling and powerful, hypnotic riffs and awesome solos, thundering bass lines, excellent rock solid drumming, brilliant sing-a-long choruses, and everything else in between, and even the album's cover artwork is just super awesome as well. The album's production is once again handled by Nick Raskulinecz who also worked on the band's previous release from 2011 \"The Hunter\" (which was another amazing album BTW), and his production on here just never fails, I mean the overall sound is just excellent throughout. Now let's get to the vocals here as both bassist Troy Sanders and guitarist Brent Hinds do such an amazing job at roaring and belting out each lyric off of each other with such passion and brilliance throughout, and of course drummer Brann Dailor also delivers his share of amazing vocals abilities especially on tracks such as \"The Motherload\" and \"Ember City\". The guitars are also fantastic on here as both Brent Hinds and Bill Kelliher muscle their way flawlessly with fantastically dynamic and mind boggling, technical riffs and killer, wailing leads and solos, and Brann Dailor's drumming of is top notch and dynamic as always with great solid beats and fills, a variety of tempos and everything else in between.\n\nWe begin the album with the excellent opening track \"Tread Lightly\" which is one of my favorites songs off the album as well as one of the best opening tracks that Mastodon have ever done as well. The song begins with a nice acoustic bit, and thrusts into a muscular and energetic mid paced anthem with a driving rhythm, along with commanding riffs and pounding bass lines, plus a soaring anthemic chorus and a deliciously awesome guitar solo near the end. The second track and my favorite off the album \"The Motherload\" is another energetic rocker that starts with a heavy, hammering drum intro from Dailor and then goes into another muscular mid tempo vibe with crunchy, groove driven riffs and thundering bass, and energetic drumming plus amazingly catchy and ear piercing vocal melodies by Dailor as well. This song also features an extremely addicting and memorable chorus, and some ripping melodic soloing to boot. Track three \"High Road\" is another favorite and a big riff heavy number that boasts heavy, muscular sludgy riffs throughout, and it also features another memorable chorus and catchy melodic harmony leads, meanwhile the album title track keeps the goodies coming. Elsewhere, track five \"Chimes at Midnight\" is another epic song that starts off with some hazy, alien-like soaring guitar lines before punching the listener in the gut with a ramming attack of propulsive, chugging chainsaw riffing, plus hefty, pounding drums and awesome vocals throughout, and the song also ends with the same hazy guitar lines from the beginning as well.\n\nMoving onwards, track six \"Asleep in the Deep\" is a dreary yet melodic number that features dreary, clean vocals aided by a steady bass groove and jazzy drumming, plus some catchy melodic guitar leads. It also features some trippy synth lines courtesy of Isaiah \"Ikey\" Owens of The Mars Volta, as well as some fantastic melodic soloing near the end. The following tracks \"Feast Your Eyes\" and \"Aunt Lisa\" both continue the epicness especially \"Aunt Lisa\" which is another one of my favorites that features more fantastic guitar work and drumming throughout, plus more awesome vocals including some vicious high pitched screams\/shrieks thrown in, and it also features an extremely addicting and catchy female high school cheerleader team vocal chant that channels both The Ramones and Faith No More near the end as well. Moving forward, we've got track nine \"Ember City\" which is yet another one of my favorite songs on here, as well as one of my favorite Mastodon songs. This song features more massive, energetic riffing and deft, pounding drum beats, plus another memorable and addictingly soaring melodic chorus, and the song is also memorable for it's lengthy and ripping, wailing guitar solo section. Track ten \"Halloween\" is also another energetic and heavily groove centric song that is highlighted by yet more memorable riffs, plus great bass and energetic drumming, as well as more awesome ripping and shredding solos to boot, and of course \"Diamond in the Witch House\" is the album's near 8 minute epic finale that features guest vocals from Neurosis mouthpiece Scott Kelly.\n\nAll in all, Mastodon's \"Once More 'Round the Sun\" is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of an album from start to finish, and is filled with tons of variety and a perfect mixture of melody, heaviness and technicality throughout. This album has definitely become one of my favorite metal albums of 2014 along with Behemoth's \"The Satanist\", Judas Priest's \"Redeemer of Souls\", Crowbar's \"Symmetry in Black\", Insomnium's \"Shadows of the Dying Sun\", Cannibal Corpse's newly released \"A Skeletal Domain\", just to name a few, and it has definitely gotten an extreme amount of playing time in my CD stereo especially ever since I first bought this CD over the summer thus resulting in one of my favorite albums of the year. Believe me, this album flat out rules, and it's truly worthy of Mastodon's name for sure...Strongly recommended for fans of Mastodon and metal!!! Stay Heavy!!!\n\n\\m\/","classification":5}

{"text":"When it has came down to rarp music, controversy and all, it has been over a decade since Eminem came out swinging with My Name Is. While he has his share of public and personal heartbreak, he has had songs with amusing videos that would make you laugh, and deeper songs that stood still. That honestly is the same with Beautiful, the second single from his returning album Relapse. the song is very dark, but does state well with a hard core stand still, whether you can't get out of a jam, or dealing with heartbreak. While the song isn't as driven as was the case with his Oscar-winning Lose Yourself, Eminem holds his own fairly well. While he has been lately making a bit more news on his war of words with Mariah Carey, he still knows how to rap. I do hope his next single from Relapse though, can have a bit more from what I had heard from what Slim Shady made to be.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3}

{"text":"It took me a little while to warm up to Tank. I had not listened closely to the lyrics of \"Maybe I Deserve\" until recently and now I know just how powerful the song is lyrically. Unfortunately, it was featured on a terrible album he released entitled \"Force of Nature.\" That is simply one of the worse albums I have ever listened to. Fast forward. I recently saw Tank at the 2011 Essence Music Festival and I liked him. He is a confident and sexy guy, so I decided to give him another try. I am delighted that I did because \"Now or Never\" was a sensational listening experience!\n\n\"Now or Never\" is heavy on the ballads, but that is always fine with a sap such as myself. The ballads are quite touching. Yes, indeed, the songwriting here is something else! He's a fine songwriter. \"Emergency\" is one of my favorite songs. I listened to it over and over again. I like the hook and the emotion he sang with. \"Amazing\" is another highlight where Tank gives us his best falsetto. Here, Tank is telling his woman how amazing and incredible she is. It's a true love song. \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" has a nice melody, but sad words. Ironically, the most sub-par song here is one that he joins forces with Chris Brown on: \"Foreplay.\" I'm sorry, but this song is simply average. With all that talent on a track, I feel that these fellers could have done something better.\n\nOverall, this album is certainly a winner. I recommend it to lovers of R&B music. I enjoyed just about every moment.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n1. \"Can I\"\n2. \"I Can't Make You Love Me\"\n3. \"Emergency\"\n4. \"Amazing\"\n5. \"Sex Music\"","classification":4}

{"text":"I took a chance on this album and it paid off. Carly Rae Jepsen's \"E*MO*TION\" is a catchy but fluid dance album. Carly said she was inspired by classic pop albums of the '80s and '90s. I hear a little bit of Janet Jackson, Cyndi Lauper, Madonna, Cathy Dennis, and even Debbie Gibson in these songs. Below is my run-down of each track. I have the deluxe edition courtesy of Target which also contains 2 bonus songs. So in all, 17 tracks:\n\n\"Run Away With Me\" - The song that made me interested in purchasing this record. It's got a dreamy, synth-heavy quality to it. Very romantic.\n\"Emotion\" - I really love this song. Has a great chorus. Reminds of an early '90s dance track. Breezy but with a punch. Definitely a highlight.\n\"I Really Like You\" - I really, really, really, really, really, really like this song. But I admit, it's an odd, safe choice for a first single.\n\"Gimmie Love\" - I like the thumping dance beat. The only downfall is the lyrics. Too repetitive. This song is very laid-back. Simple.\n\"All That\" - A striking and sultry pop ballad. We see another side to Carly. I wish this album had more ballads. Carly's voice shines here.\n\"Boy Problems\" - My least favorite song. Hard to believe this track was co-written by Sia. Too bubblegum pop. Juvenile and pointless.\n\"Making the Most of the Night\" - Another song co-written by Sia. This is one is much better. The hook is incredible. Very intense.\n\"Your Type\" - Has a strong, catchy, but emotional chorus. Definitely the most '80s sounding track on this album. I love it.\n\"Let's Get Lost\" - Pretty song but easily forgettable. I can never seem to recall the melody. Not bad, but not as good as the rest.\n\"LA Hallucinations\" - When the album really starts to come alive. I love the smug lyrics. I think this song would be a huge hit. It's edgy.\n\"Warm Blood\" - The best track in my opinion. Pure sex. A haunting mid-tempo track. The melody is insanely good.\n\"When I Needed You\" - Has that classic, slick, glossy '80s sound but definitely not corny. A sassy break-up song. Nice synth.\n\"Black Heart\" - Has an early '90s house music vibe. This is the first of the bonus songs. Short but sweet. Awesome techno beat. Gorgeous.\n\"I Didn't Just Come Here to Dance\" - Another song with an incredible hook. The piano riff is nearly identical to Madonna's \"Vogue\".\n\"Favourite Colour\" - Could this song be any more beautiful?! The lyrics are full of imagery. \"I'm bright baby blue, falling into you...\" Stunning.\n\"Never Get to Hold You\" - Pretty melody. That's the great thing about Carly, she writes really unique melodies. Good arrangement.\n\"Love Again\" - Love the numerous tempo changes. Charming and hopeful. With the exception of \"Boy Problems\" - this is a solid pop record.\n\nNot trying to be snarky but I never thought I'd be a fan of Carly Rae Jepsen. After I heard \"Call Me Maybe\" a few years ago, I definitely pegged her as a one-hit wonder. \"E*MO*TION\" proves she definitely had some tricks up her sleeve. I love her breathy vocals during the verses, and how strong and melodic her voice sounds during the choruses. What makes this album strong are the array of colorful melodies. The music and production is strong too. Nothing sounds dated or artificial which isn't easy to do with a heavy '80s\/'90s influenced album. My hats off to Carly for a proving a \"music snob\" like me wrong. BUY. THIS. ALBUM. NOW. Enjoy!","classification":5}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nWith that said, I did pay for this this song.  If however, you are just looking to build a music library on a budget, I'd highly recommend checking out Amazon's free \/ cheap collection of music, featuring songs as well as albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies or really good digital music deals (69 cent songs, $5 albums!), you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Departments (drop down menu) --> Digital and Prime Music -->Deals --> Songs by Price \/ Albums by Price (on left side of screen)","classification":5}

Musically, she showcased being the world's great soulful singer, whom not only made covers brilliantly, but songs all her own. The biggest example is I Will Always Love You from The Bodyguard. The song is just as intimate and beautiful from her soulful heart and voice alone. Something that stands taller beyond the tests of time. The song is honestly the biggest movie song of all time, and definitely is the most classic cover she had ever done in a lifetime. Her Dolly Parton cover even stands taller than any song that anyone has made within the past several years.

{"text":"Huge Dre & Death Row Fan! If Dre spits on a record, I would buy it so its no surprise when Ice Cube announced a day before Dre did that this secret album was coming out I got excited and then Dre confirmed on his Pharmacy radio show. Fans went \"bananas\" (as Dre described Ice Cube's track) waiting to hear and see the track listing. After all, its been 16 years waiting for Detox which he eventually confessed on the Pharmacy that he didn't like it and scrapped it. I don't know about you but the leaked tracks and the ones he released sounded amazing. Just search Dr. Dre detox unreleased on YouTube and you will find those joints with Jay Z, Eminem, TI and Game. Dope! Pure Genius!\n\nNow, I purchased this on iTunes like everyone because at the time they said it was exclusive to Apple and there was no word on the cd launch. I couldn't wait or take any chances so I bought it the night of the streaming. When I first heard it I thought it was just not sounding right from my laptop so I copied it to my mp3 player and cd and took it to ride along to with my homeboy the same night. We were both so disappointed! What is up with this new sound and how does the beats, lifestyle and pure genius from the NWA days INSPIRE you to make this?\n\nDre has spent the last 16 years perfecting Detox and didn't release it because he felt it was leaked, didn't live up and all that yet he can finish an album in a few weeks and release it thinking we will all love it after a \"few listens\" or hoping it \"will grow on us\" or \"keep an open mind\" as some reviewers are saying on amazon. No it doesn't work like that Dre and to my fellow fans we deserve better and we were owed a better album and he has to be accountable for this. I don't know about you but I bump my Chronic and Chronic 2001 today, years later. Can you honestly say you can bump this Compton album even next year or the year after? It sounds like everything else out right now! There's absolutely nothing special about this and don't tell me Kendrick's joints are hot - ALL KENDRICK'S JOINTS ARE ALWAYS HOT! We buy Dre's albums because of the chemistry of the artists and amazing production - revolutionary sound. I felt like production was all over and some of the lyrics didn't even go with the beats.\n\nThe first joint \"Talk about it\" is good and the \"One Shot One Kill\" with Snoop is dope. The other with Xzibit and the last joint My Diary sounds more like Dre. I didn't expect a Chronic follow up or a Chronic sound, I expected a fantastic final album from the best Rap Producer of all time. Dre disappointed many fans and don't tell me I need to give it a chance and a few spins to grow on me. Is that what a Dre album has come to or what we should settle for? Say what you want but at the end of it all, Dre did Fall Off.\n\n#DeathRow","classification":1}

Of all the songs she did for that album, Love On Top has to be one of the worst songs she had done. She really let her voice and the tone go badly. The way her high notes are on the song, and not really good. I really wasn't impressed with the song. It honestly has been one of her worst songs she had ever done.

There is not a single poor track on this album, because its a sort of greatest hits album. There are distinctions to every song, from the female vocals ranging from haunting to wonderous, the norwegian folk influences, to the exotic instrumental features, to the prominence of string soloing. And the epicness. Yes, epicness. Its a tacky way to say, but its true. This album makes you want to close your eyes and exhale slowly and loudly. It makes you imagine goddesses rising out of the ocean, or a formidable army of spartan-esque soldiers marching across vast plains, with huge banners and chanting ominously. It gives you goosebumps and makes you smile and hum along. And if you're alone, you may may find yourself pretending to conduct the musicians. Or in my case, when you think you're alone. My coworkers still make fun of me to this day.","classification":5}

{"text":"Richard Marx is one of my favorite singer\/songwriters ever. In an era where most things felt over-produced, dramatic, or downright cheesy, the music of Richard Marx felt like a breath of fresh air. One of his most famous songs is a post relationship classic \"Should've Known Better.\" Richard Marx voice allows the listener to believe that he has truly expierianced the heartbreak of which he sings. Something that is def. lacking in today's mostly soulless popular music scene. There's something universal in the loss of love that Richard Marx manages to capture though without delivering a four minute funeral procession in the process.","classification":5}

Talk about addictive!  I can listen to this album over and over from start to finish.  Like I said, I'm new to Stryper, so older fans of the band might not see it the same way, but Yahweh is one of the most original sounding, amazing songs that I've ever heard.  The church-like \"Yahweh\" at the beginning followed by an incredible riff and then it just gets better from there.  I can't get that song out of my head.  My kids are getting tired of me singing it around the house (probably due to my \"singing\" more than anything).  But after that song, there are so many other great songs on here, such as Sorry, Lost, Big Screen Lies, King of Kings...you name it, they're all good.  Stryper isn't as heavy as many of the groups I listen to (Megadeth, Slayer, Kreator, C.O.C...to name but a few), but they more than make up for it in song craft and melody, not to mention an uplifting message (and some nice riffs to boot).  I really like this album and I'm finding myself really liking Stryper as well.  If you haven't listened to this yet...what are you waiting for?  Check it out!","classification":5}

{"text":"I heard some mention about Robert Randolph & the Family Band here and there from various sources. But when I saw them perform on The Tonight Show one night, that was all I needed. I instantly rushed out and picked up the album.\nTo say that this album, Unclassified, is great would be an understatement. Robert Randolph and his band (consisting of all family members, in case the name didn't tip you off) provide this great album full of funk and soul. There are a few instrumental tracks that just let the band do their thing, like \"Run For Your Life\", the calypso style of, well, \"Calypso\", and the best one, \"Squeeze\". And the songs you should've heard already, \"Going In the Right Direction\" and \"I Need More Love\", still sound excellent.\nOther standouts are the funky \"Soul Refreshing\" and \"Why Should I Feel Lonely\". I even like \"Problems\", a we-are-the-world style song that doesn't sound so clichd. Actually, there's no song on here that's a waste of time. Unclassified IS classified -- as one of the best albums of last year.\nAnthony Rupert","classification":5}

The only complaint I have is deformity was much more pronounced in the comics. If I remember correctly, that part of his face was the bone of his skeleton and his teeth (on that side) were always showing. With today's technology, you'd think they could have done the affect a better. The story line was good though a bit far fetched in areas. Over all, the movie was very entertaining.

{"text":"Oscar-winner Hudson's album is a fairly decent release of what-passes-for \"contemporary\" R & B, complete with guest performances from the likes of Ludacris and T.Pain.  It is because of such pairings that reduce the album by one star.  Perhaps the producers feel that, in order to garner a younger audience, the singer needed some \"help.\"  That is far from the truth because Hudson is, most definitely, a force to be reckoned with...and the songs on the album, though passable, are for the most part, not up to the level of her talent.  Some of them sound like Beyonce' \"throwaways\" even though Hudson has a better set of pipes than the more popular \"Miss B.\"\n\nBest cuts:\n\"Spotlight\"\n\"Pocketbook\" (without the embarrassingly tacky Ludacris rap)\n\"My Heart\"\n\"You Pulled Me Through\"\n\"Can't Stop the Rain\"\n\"We Gon' Fight\"\n\"Jesus Promised Me a Home Over There\"...\n\nand, of course, \"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\" (highlights)\n\nAlbum running time: 52.1 minutes","classification":4}

{"text":"I've already reviewed the three parts to this album, and so I'm doing a little `cut and paste' action with this review.  I wasn't too surprised to see that this album was dropped as a complete disc, since that seems to be the mode (buy them one by one only to have it drop as one album when all is said and done) but this is one of the few occurances where buying them separate was the better way to go.  While this album contains most everything that was released on the individual `parts', this album is missing a few of the best tracks (like that `Dancing on My Own' remix).\n\nI'm glad I got the separate discs.\n\nThat said, if you shoot for this album instead you won't be missing much, and it is still SOOOO worth owning (thus the A grade).\n\nI'm just going to break this out by the tracks included from the different parts.\n\nPart 1...\n\n`Fembot' is pretty explosive. The structure of this song is light, airy, pop-princess yumminess that totally adds the needed layers of edge that make it signature Robyn. `Dancehall Queen' may be my favorite track from that album (they are all so good though). It has an almost `Police-esque' vibe to it, with an air of Reggae influence until the bouncy chorus catches on and brings a gigantic smile to my face. Robyn has a beautiful way of making HAPPY music that is edgy enough to validate adult enjoyment.  `None of Dem' is slinky, seductive and completely engaging.  The original version of `Dancing on My Own' (which is the version included here) is heart-tugging in its context yet certainly worthy of dance-floor choreography. You get the idea that Robyn is the sweet and shafted heroine, which is soft and vulnerable in texture.  I was never a huge fan of `Don't Tell Me What To Do', but it has grown on me a great deal.\n\nThe omissions from the actual singular disc include the remix of `Dancing on My Own', the acoustic version of `Hang With Me' (which is better than the version provided on this disc from `Pt. 2'), `Cry When I Get Older' (which is the least successful track from `Pt. 1', so it's omission is acceptable) and `Jag Vet En Dejlig Rosa', which is a sad omission since it is one of the most beautiful songs she has recorded.\n\nPart 2...\n\n`Hang With Me' and `Love Kills' rely on that tinge of commercial pop-quality that Robyn understands how to layer effectively. Her delivery is smooth and enticing and her songs are incredibly catchy. I got these beautiful glimpses of her 90's work all over these songs, which added a nice splash of nostalgia to the offering. `Hang With Me' has a beautiful beat and a sweet sincerity within the vocal delivery, although I really wish they had swapped this out with the acoustic version from `Pt. 1'. `Love Kills' adds that edginess that sets Robyn apart from her former self. It is brilliantly controlled, with a pulsating beat that will send shivers, and the way that Robyn sinks her teeth into the dark side of love is splendidly realized here.  Personally, `In My Eyes' is a tad generic, `We Dance to The Beat' lacks a little heart and `U Should Know Better' is a little uninspired, considering the collaboration with Snoop Dogg (the song is fun, but it just doesn't reach the heights it should have).\n\nThe omissions from the actual singular album are UNFORGIVABLE here.  `Include Me Out' is stellar and should have been here.  It's one of the best tracks from `Pt. 2', as is `Criminal Intent'.  They also don't include the version of `Indestructible' here as well.  Again, this was a bad decision.  They include the version from `Pt. 3', which is far more club savvy, but this orchestral ballad should have been the version included, as it is far better.\n\nPart 3...\n\nEvery track from `Pt. 3' is included here (as should be expected) and in the end I would have rather seen them exclude tracks like `Stars 4-Ever' for some of the better tracks omitted from the first two albums, but then again, I own all three `parts' so it doesn't really effect me.\n\nThe redone version of `Indestructible' (the closing track to `Body Talk Pt. 2') gets the album (or EP) opened on a great note. I loved the original version (which I still prefer), but this version is totally club ready and more in line with what we expect from Robyn. It's a strong and catchy way to get the album up and going. `Time Machine' is even better. The whole concept of the song is superb. The backing chants are a great touch; the lyrics are a nice look at a common occurrence and the way Robyn delivers everything is spot on. I love the way the chorus almost feels like a different song. It is so bubbly and catchy and the verse structure has a more straightforward and darker tone. They are perfect compliments!  `Call Your Girlfriend' is my favorite track on the album. It is mellow for Robyn (despite what you may think, she does mellow VERY well) but it has her signature edge that elevates the track, and her soft vocals are stunningly effective.  And then there are the last two tracks.  `Get Myself Together', while very good, isn't anything compared to the greatness of `Time Machine' (it also feels a tad too familiar), and `Stars 4-Ever' is just kind of bad.\n\nFor those of you interested, here is my ranking of the album as a whole:\n\n1) Call Your Girlfriend\n2) Dancehall Queen\n3) Fembot\n4) Love Kills\n5) Dancing on My Own\n6) Time Machine\n7) None of Dem\n8) Hang With Me\n9) Indestructible\n10) Don't Tell Me What To Do\n11) Get Myself Together\n12) In My Eyes\n13) U Should Know Better\n14) We Dance to the Beat\n15) Stars 4-Ever\n\nAs you can probably guess, I strongly advice spending a little extra money and buying all three parts separately, but if you want to just get this one album know that it is still worth it and certainly contains a worthy admission to the Robyn discography.","classification":5}

{"text":"Lately Ive been having a great deal of success in finding large compilations of classical music at unbelievably low prices. Ive been reading some uniformly glowing reviews of the Big Box albums from The Bach Guild, so I decided to purchase one to see if its as good as reviewers say it is.\n\nMy first choice was the Big Haydn Symphonies Box, featuring over nine hours of Franz Joseph Haydns symphonies, for only 99 cents. This MP3 album contains a quite impressive array of music from the composer known as the father of the modern symphony. Haydn composed 104 symphonies during his long lifetime, and 24 of them appear in their entirety in Big Haydn Symphonies Box. They range from his earlier light-hearted works, through his more impassioned Sturm und Drang middle symphonies, and on to his most famous later Paris and London symphonic masterpieces.\n\nThese are all very fine performances from the 1950s through the 1970s. They feature various world-class orchestras and conductors who seem to mostly hail from eastern Europe. These ensembles may not have been as renowned as many of their more famous western counterparts, but their artistry and musicianship are undeniably every bit as good. They consistently do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama of Haydns great symphonic masterworks.\n\nThere are two unfortunate technical flaws in Big Haydn Symphonies Box that prevent me from awarding this otherwise outstanding album my full 5-star rating. There is a short but noticeable high-pitched tone at the 1:19 mark of track 13. Although its not particularly bothersome, the albums engineers should have noticed and removed it. Also, the final movement of Symphony No. 90 is incorrect. Although the tracks metadata correctly lists it as Finale: Allegro Assai, the music is actually a duplicate of the first movement of Symphony No. 91. Again, the albums engineers should have discovered and eliminated this error.\n\nDespite these minor flaws, Big Haydn Symphonies Box is an excellent MP3 album that I enjoy listening to on a regular basis. Highly recommended.","classification":4}

{"text":"Kem's \"Intimacy: Album III\" is filled with satisfying, soul-drenched warm-bath ballads that will please his fan base. The result is a winning fusion of of old-school R&B and contemporary jazz.\n\nHe uses his expressive, intimate voice with great intelligence. He is capable of eliciting drama where his contemporaries tend to overdo or undersell. His limitations as a producer and song writer are therefore minimized.\n\nThe ethereal, distant quality of his earlier material has given way to something more straightforward and sensual, making the album incidentally more palatable.\n\n\"When I'm Loving You\" is a fine example with its lush, tropical atmosphere, complete with acoustic guitar tropical and ear-pleasing drum patter. Comparisons to Sade are inevitable. \"Can You Feel It\" and \"Human Touch\" continue the pattern, with Kem's voice riding the waves of his busy, seductive melodies.\n\nThese songs are built less upon radio-ready hooks and more on grooves, texture and the sincerity of Kem's delivery. That said, the cliched yet well-crafted lead single \"Why Would You Stay?\" has done well on the airwaves, hitting the top 20 of Billboard's Hot R&B\/Hip-Hop songs chart. Its overtly romantic quality and distinctly 90s-sounding production reminds of Boyz II Men. \"You're On My Mind\" follows suit.\n\nJill Scott adds a shot of caffeine to the gospel-infused \"Golden Days\" with her inspired preaching, and Maurissa Rose complements Kem beautifully on the inspired \"If It's Love,\" another R&B slow-burn and potential hit. The best track is \"A Mother's Love\" with its piano-driven, double-edged melody. It's as beautiful as its title.\n\nSessions for the album took place over a three-year span - this music was clearly and carefully labored over. There are other artists with similar voices and songwriting ability, but \"Intimacy: Album III\" shows Kem to be a dedicated, passionate musician deserving of his place on the shelf.","classification":4}

She really did throw people a hard hit, where her songs are not as strong in where she could've gone. Me Too, her latest single from Thank You, really doesn't deliver. She really delivered more of a sound that really showed she is a shell of herself.

{"text":"The title of the song is based upon advice given to the lead singer, by a female he met, 'long years ago.'  The advice is, that, when it comes to female relationships, that a man should 'Hold On Loosely' female, but that he should not hold on too tight, or he'll 'lose control' of the situation!  Good advice that should be considered as one wanders through the obstacle course(s) of life.  Right?  Right.  Basically, the advice is this, 'Give your baby a little 'spank' on the toosh reminding her that you are paying attention to her actions, and that you care, and are aware that other men might be interested, and that you have a 'potential' for some jealousy should a situation arise - but just a little 'spank' - just reminding her that you're the man.  If you try to actually control her - she'll 'SPANK' you back 100 times harder than you could ever handle!  So, the advice, from a woman, for the benefit of man, is to just 'Hold On Loosely' - and she'll continue to 'play along' and let you 'think' that you're in control!\n\nAdvice.\n\nEveryone's got it.\n\n:-)","classification":4}

{"text":"An artist's sophomore album is often the one where they truly come into their own, and can show off who they are as an artist. It is very rare that the second effort is just as powerful as the debut, and it is the mark of an amazing artist who is able to pull that off. Luckily, Jazmine Sullivan is one of those rare artists who continues the momentum of her debut with her 2010 album, Love Me back. Jazmine is one of the rare artists whose voice alone evokes emotion, making every performance sound personal and passionate. She also marks herself as an artist who is truly \"fearless\", as her debut title suggested, taking several risks with her new material which nearly always pay off. Although this album is neither as instant, nor as haunting, as her debut, it is an excellent follow-up and one that continues to mark Jazmine as an artist to watch.\n\nLead single \"Holding You Down\" immediately showcases Jazmine's incredible voice over track reminiscent of 90s R&B. Despite containing multiple samples, courtesy of Missy Elliott serving as producer, Jazmine easily makes it her own. Although it is not as instantly catchy as debut single \"Bust Your Windows\", it certainly matches anything on her debut in terms of quality. Second single \"10 Seconds\" takes on more of the haunting quality that permeated much of Jazmine's debut, as she sings about her giving her man ten seconds to leave after he mistreats her. Jazmine delivers an extremely passionate performance, with just the right balance of anger with a touch of sadness. The bridge is particularly strong.  \"Good Enough\" depicts Jazmine at her most independent, telling a man that she refuses to waste her time on someone that does not appreciate her. The lyrics are relatively simple and straightforward, doing an excellent job of showcasing the song's message. It's a creative take on a break-up song, with the woman acknowledging that she's been unappreciated yet simultaneously realizing that she can, and will, do better.\n\n\"Don't Make Me Wait\" is the album's first truly upbeat track, and a fan favourite likely due to the similarities to Prince. Although it is not a personal favourite, it is a nice change of pace that keeps the album from becoming too dark. The track does get repetitive in places, but Jazmine's delivery keeps it strong. \"Love You Long Time\" is another of the album's less memorable tracks, but it is quite a strong filler track. This is one of the rare songs where Jazmine truly sounds happy, focusing on a relationship that is going well. The main problem with this song is that the production is slightly too busy, and almost overwhelms Jazmine's voice which is not an easy feat given how powerful a singer she is. Although it does not necessarily stand out on its own, it is far from a weak track. \"Redemption\" is another truly haunting track, and one that was quite a big risk. Jazmine nearly raps the verses before belting the chorus, singing about finding redemption for one's mistakes. It is lyrically quite a powerful track, yet as a concept\/storyline song it is one that many fans might not appreciate. Like it or not, Jazmine should definitely be credited for her creativity and the fact that was willing to take such a large risk.\n\n\"Excuse Me\" is Jazmine's first proper love ballad, and it easily proves that she can shine just as much on happy songs as on her darker tracks. Both vocally and lyrically, it does not quite compare to some of her strongest work, however it certainly proves her to be versatile with her subject matter. Her passionate delivery makes her just as believable on a love song as it is on tracks about anger or heartbreak. \"U Get On My Nerves\", a duet with Ne-Yo, is a bittersweet break-up song in the form of a dialogue between the two singers. This is one of the most highly criticized tracks for everything from a supposed lack of chemistry between the singers, and for sounding much too \"polished\" for Jazmine. Although the rawness of her voice is toned down, it does not detract from her ability to evoke emotion. This track is an unexpected standout, and a personal favourite. Despite the complaints, there does seem to be vocal chemistry between the singers, making the track truly believable. \"Stuttering\" is another rather risky track, where Jazmine literally stutters some of the lyrics. The concept behind this song is that something about a man renders Jazmine nearly speechless, so that when she tries to speak, she ends up stuttering. Luckily, her risk once again pays off to become one of the album's stronger tracks, despite some lyrical weakness. Her vocal performance on this track is more subdued than usual, yet retains its usual passion. It is a creative, somewhat gimmicky, track which ends up working, particularly on the powerful bridge.\n\n\"Famous\" is yet another highlight, and a personal favourite. Any artist who sings about fame runs the risk of sounding self-centred. However, Jazmine manages to craft a masterful track that truly sounds genuine and even relatable, with vocals that can give chills. Where other artists use songs about fame to complain about the constant attention or to brag about what they have, Jazmine instead describes the desire for fame and to be important. Although this is by far the longest track on the album, Jazmine easily manages to keep it fresh throughout so that it never seems to drag on. This track is truly Jazmine at her best. Despite \"Famous\" appearing to be the perfect closing track for the album, Jazmine is never one to end her albums on a serious note. Carrying on in a similar vein to \"Switch\" from her debut, Jazmine closes off this album with the fun, reggae-tinged \"Luv Back\". This track brings the album full-circle. Where \"Holding You Down\" described Jazmine questioning why she keeps going back to a troubled relationship, \"Luv Back\" has her telling a man that she's completely over him and moved on. This track once again proves that Jazmine is just as strong on upbeat and happier tracks as she is with her darker material.\n\nOverall Mark: 4.5\/5\n\nOnly two albums into her career, Jazmine Sullivan has already established herself as a force to be reckoned with. Both albums so far have been true showcases of her numerous talents as a singer and a songwriter. Love Me Back builds on all of the strengths of Jazmine's debut, especially her ability to take risks with her music. Jazmine is unafraid to try new things with her songs, and more often than not, they work well. The only problem with taking so many risks is that it makes the album a little less cohesive in places, with certain tracks (\"Don't Make Me Wait\" for instance), sounding a bit out of place. Jazmine still does somewhat better on her darker material than the love ballads, however even the weaker tracks on the album are solid quality. Her passion and ability to evoke emotion from even the simplest lyrics certainly help to make even the weaker tracks sound believable. It will certainly be interesting to see what Jazmine will come out with next.","classification":4}

{"text":"Paolo Nutini is yet another person that I was introduced to as a VH1 You Oughta Know artist, and I was surprised to learn that a strong voice like that was coming from a guy that's only nineteen years old (well, he was when the album was recorded). Yes, I also didn't realize that this album, These Streets, was released over a year ago, but I'm glad I finally discovered it.\n\nMost people are probably only familiar with \"New Shoes\", but there are plenty of other highlights as well, like \"Last Request\" and the title track. There are also some good acoustic selections, whether it be piano (\"Autumn\") or guitar (\"White Lies\"). And \"Jenny Don't Be Hasty\" has some pretty interesting lyrics.\n\nEven though the second (acoustic) version of \"Last Request\" (the hidden track after the hidden track) is unnecessary, Paolo Nutini still has the skills, so you shouldn't mind taking a drive down these streets.\n\nAnthony Rupert","classification":4}

{"text":"In country music, one name stands above all others: Willie Nelson.  While not a huge Willie fan, I've always admired the man, for he has such a talent for bringing a song to life.  And \"The Great Divide\" is no exception.\nI won't waste time telling you which songs were my favorites, for you are not me.  I will tell you, however, that you are in for a treat.  Rob Thomas, Sheryl Crow, and Bonnie Rait show themselves for harmony duets, blending their voices well with Willie's.  Lee Ann Womack, Kid Rock, and Brian McKnight go for the full-fledged thing--bringing to life tales of gunslingers, lost loves, and hope.  Willie redoes the old Kenny Rogers rock'n'roll song \"Just Dropped In...\" and goes entirely country on the title track and \"This Face,\" a wonderful ballad about aging.  \"Maria,\" \"Last Stand,\" \"Be There For You,\" and \"Time After Time\" keep the album's upbeat going, while \"Mendocino County Line\", \"Won't Catch Me Crying,\" \"Don't Fade Away,\" \"Recollection Phoenix\", and \"You Remain\" provide a gentler, quieter side.\nWith all the talent on this CD (with Willie, of course, being the most prominent) this is one divide you should not step across.  Take the time to pick it up and listen to it...who knows, you just may have a good time, Heaven forbid!","classification":5}

I listened to this disc 3 times and I loved it as much as I did the spin before.  It's so hard to believe that this 72 year old man can bring it, but with his legacy being a member of the famous Isley Brothers, you can tell by this cd that he didn't leave his past of beautiful music behind.

{"text":"\"Sparkle\" is the last movie Whitney Houston appeared in. The movie is a remake and is set in the sixties, something the soundtrack pays homage to.\n\nOpening are a trio of highlights; the horn-peppered funky ditty by Cee Lo Green with vocals channeling Al Green singing the lines \"When the morning comes and I'm not there, Darlin', please understand that I'm a man!', \"Yes I Do\" by Carmen Ejogo, a bouncy Motown-style number, and Goapele's \"Running\" which is set thumping beats with hues of Martha Reeves and the Vandellas. A winning opening salvo.\n\nNext come songs which featured in the 1976 movie; the ballad \"Hooked On Your Love\" features Carmen Ejogo, Tika Sumpter, and Jordin Sparks and is velvet smooth soul. They also perform the upbeat clap-sprinkled \"Jump\" and the sensual \"Something He Can Feel\" (the latter which can't hold a candle to the Aretha or En Vogue versions but is still smooth and nice in its restrained way).  Whitney performs \"His Eye Is On The Sparrow\" (not in the 1976 movie) to cascading piano\/organ accompaniment initially, with a choir coming in towards the end - understated yet regal. \"Look Into Your Heart\" is a piano ballad by Sparks, who also sings the R. Kelly-penned Gospel-style \"One Wish\" (featuring Sparks' most theatrical vocals) and \"Love Will\", the latter with a spoken intro. Closing is the upbeat \"Celebrate, also penned by Mr Kelly, with stomping beats and a neo disco sound.\n\nThe 11 tracks clock in at just under 37 minutes. A polished and nice soundtrack, but it still somewhat leaves you wanting more.","classification":4}

{"text":"He was a powerful force on the Billboard charts for more than a quarter century. Over the years this dynamic artist would prove to be not only a splendid singer but a talented musician and gifted songwriter to boot. His records were a fixture on American radio through most of the 60's, 70's and 80's. Yes, Stevie Wonder truly was and remains an American original.\n\nDuring the 1960's Stevie Wonder made quite a few memorable records. You might recall his first big hit \"Fingertips - Pt 2\" which went all the way to the top of the charts in 1963! \"Little Stevie Wonder\" was just 12 years old when this tune was recorded and it quickly became obvious to all that this young man was a star in the making. During the 1960's Wonder would go on to have nearly two dozen charted singles including the rollicking \"I Was Made To Love Her\", \"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\" and the beautiful love song \"My Cherie Amour\" in 1969.\n\nFor all of the success he enjoyed in the 1960's Stevie Wonder would go on to even bigger and better things during the 1970's.  Stevie was definitely on a roll and five of his singles would make all the way to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart.  In the fall of 1976 Stevie Wonder released his masterpiece, the 2 LP set \"Songs In The Key Of Life\".  The album was an immediate smash debuting at #1 the week of October 16, 1976. It spent 14 weeks at the top of the charts and an impressive 35 weeks in the Top Ten.  The project yielded a total of 4 Top 40 singles two of which went all the way to #1.\n\nAs far as I am concerned \"I Wish\" is one of the two or three best singles Stevie Wonder ever released.  The tune earned Stevie a Grammy for the Best R&B Male Vocal performance of 1976.  This song has it all:  fabulous music, a powerful vocal and a dynamic lyric.  This is an artist who is clearly at the top of his game.","classification":5}

{"text":"Not perfect but there's a lot here worth your time and certainly your 99 cents.\n\nThe high points:\n  Howard Shelley's Beethoven ##3 & 5 and he's the pianist in the Triple Concerto.  He takes fairly swift tempi but doesn't rush and his Beethoven has plenty of spirit.\n  Bruce Hungerford's Beethoven #4 - OK, it's mono and an unnamed orchestra but this is the only recording of Bruce Hungerford performing a Beethoven concerto and it's quite good.\n  Mozart Piano Concertos - 6 are here in quite good to excellent performances.  I had the Denis Matthews #20 on LP and am only sorry it's discmate (#24) wasn't included in this collection.  There is one big question mark - see below.\n  Rachmaninoff #3 - a very fine performance by Vladimir Viardo (NOT Viarto), Eduardo Mata and the Dallas Symphony\n  Tchaikovsky #1 - a memorable performance by John Ogdon, Pierre Monteux and the London Symphony, recorded live in Vienna in 1963.\n\nGood performances:\n  Chopin #1 with Rosa Lhevinne\n  Brahms #2 with Peter Serkin - not great but his suits him better than #1\n\nProblem performances\n  Brahms #1 with Peter Serkin.  Sorry but I've always heard this as \"angry young man\" music, not disgruntled senior citizen, which is what comes across here.  My model for a Brahms #1 is the 1958 recording by Gary Grafffman, Charles Munch and the BSO - which not only has fire but also sounds a lot better than this effortful recording from about 25 years later.\n  Grieg & Schumann with Russell Sherman - These are sabotaged by poor sound.  The piano is all treble and the orchestra often sounds muddy.  Plus Joseph Silverstein's conducting cannot match Ormandy, Giulini, Reiner or many others in the Schumann.  The last movement of the Schumann doesn't dance it lurches.  There also seems to be a digital hiccup at the start of the 3rd movement.\n\nSaint-Saens and Liszt with Emil Gilels and Kiril Kondrashin - definitely sound their age.  Disappointing considering how well the Oistrakh Dvorak and Glazunov Violin Concertos of roughly the same vintage sound in the \"Big Violin Concertos Box\".\n\nThe obligatory Bach Guild Box errata list\n  As noted by others, the labels on the last movement of Mozart #21 and the Beethoven Triple were swapped.\n  As also noted by others, the \"Mozart #26, \"Coronation\"\" is not that at all but the Mozart #27\n  Please BG, try to spell the performers' names correctly- the soloist in the Rachmaninoff is Vladimir Viardo\n\nMYSTERY - Who is performing the mislabeled Mozart #27?  I haven't been able to find a listing for a Peter Serkin recording of this work, even though BG gives him credit.  I've also looked for recordings of it by Bruce Hungerford, Howard Shelley and Russell Sherman but nothing turned up.  The Larghetto clocks in at > 10 minutes, which is about the most leisurely traversal I've heard.  Any guesses as to who we're hearing?","classification":5}

{"text":"Wow. It's been over six years since fans have received a new project from the Demigodz collective, but I think it's safe to say that the wait was more than worth it. I still can't wrap my head around the idea that it took this long to release their first full-length album, but it's here now and that's all that matters.\n\nIf you're into Hip Hop then these men need no introduction. Even if you've never heard of Demigodz, chances are you've heard of at least one of the members. This is grimy Hip Hop at its finest. There's no bs, no sugarcoating, no censoring, just raw lyrics. These men aren't trying to appeal to anyone but their core fan base with Killmatic and that's commendable.\n\nLyrically these six men are consistently on-point. For me Apathy and Celph Titled are definitely the standouts, with Eso coming in at third place, mainly because they're on here the most. Apathy laces every verse with an insane amount of rhymes and Celph comes through with some extremely entertaining material. A good example would be \"Stealing from donation baskets. Holding a gat on the front of his motivation pamphlet.\" from track four \"Just Can't Quit\". Of course when an album is filled with non-stop grimy material someone is bound to slip once or twice. The most notable, for me, being Panchi on track eight \"DGZ x NYGz\": \"Yea I got `em hypnotized like I'm doing voodoo.\" Two things that have almost nothing to do with each other.\n\nThe production on Killmatic is perhaps my favorite part of the album. Killmatic is home to some of the best production I've heard in a long time. The beats feel like some old-school boom-bap Hip Hop, but with just the right amount of flare so it doesn't sound dated. The only beat that had to grow on me was the one used on track twelve \"Fallen Angles\". Not a bad beat by any means, it's just very... unique when compared to the rest of the album. A good chunk of the album is produced by Apathy, but DJ Premier, Chumzilla, and Snowgoons, among others, each produce a song.\n\nKillmatic is also home to a pretty strong guest lineup. Throughout this album's 56 minute running time you'll get to hear verses from Termanology, Scoop Deville, Eternia, Panchi, Planetary, and R.A. The Rugged Man. Everyone did their thing, but I think they could've shortened the line-up to give some of the other members a little more time to shine.\n\nStandout Songs: \"Just Can't Quit (Feat. Scoop Deville)\" \"Dead In The Middle\" & \"Captain Caveman (Feat. R.A. The Rugged Man)\"\n\nOverall Score: 8.5\/10 - Bottom line, Killmatic is ill. There's no doubt about it. However, around track ten it does feel like the album's flame starts to dwindle a little bit. Still, it eventually picks back up around track thirteen and goes out with a bang with \"Audi 5000\". If you're a fan of any of these MC's then I would definitely recommend giving this a listen. If you're looking for some grimy Hip Hop then look no further. Killmatic will scratch that itch and have you coming back for more.","classification":4}

{"text":"The song, Once Bitten Twice Shy, was written by Ian Hunter (Mott The Hoople) and released in 1975 on his\nfirst solo album, with Mick Ronson (David Bowie) doing the honors as guitarist.\n\nOnce Bitten has some of the best lyrics written about rock and roll. Like the Rolling Stones, Its Only Rock\nand Roll (But I Like It), this song is about the travails of living the rock and roll dream. The Great White lead\nvocal seemed to be a bit more buried in the mix, which is a shame; they harbor great rock n roll lyrics.\n\n \"You didn't know how Rock n' Roll looked\n Until you caught your sister with a guy from the group\n Half-way home in the parking lot\n By the look in her eyes she was givin' what she got\"\n\nGreat White almost uses the same arrangement as the original with an extended sparse intro as the drums\npound half time holding back and providing some tension. That work real nice. The piano swings in about one\nthird of the way through the song which further propels the song. The piano is a nice addition and serves the\nsong well but is buried in this mix too much to continue to add to the driving feel. That is too bad. Perhaps a re-\nmix with the piano a bit more forward would benefit the 2007 release.\n\nUnfortunately, Great White punctuates the song by rocking harder. The rhythm\/lead player from the outset has\nno place to go. There is not much dynamic tension between the first half of the song and the last half. Also, the\nGreat White lead player uses a more standard rock n roll lead break. The lead barely keeps the song going but\nit doesnt take the song any higher; it doesn't propel the song further. It is a missed opportunity.\n\nMick Ronsons lead was less structured and he squeezed out one hell of a long single lead note at the end of\nhis break as the lyrics are being reintroduced. It is quite simple and brilliant. Ronsons lead brought the song to\na wonderful crescendo and propelled the song to its coda. The way the song builds dynamically in the original\nis not reflected in the Great White cover.\n\nI give it 3 stars because Great White had the good taste to record the song. Their version is serviceable for a\ncover and certainly a good song for the radio.  Its also still a fun sing-along while driving the open road. Ive got\nto give Great White credit as they were able to draw the song out to 5 minutes and did it reasonably well.\n\nQuite frankly if it were not for the strength of Hunters composition this Great White cover would not have gotten\nas much air play or attention.  Its good but its not great. When you get a chance listen to Ian Hunters 1975\nPromo Stereo Sound video, do it.","classification":3}

It was a soft acoustic love song, as sweet and innocent as they came. But Landon really made the song along with the arrangement, with his soft vocals that weren't sappy, and weren't out of place. In fact, his vocals seem to fit the song perfectly.\n\nOverall, an underrated love song sure to win the hearts of one and all. A well-crafted, well-written song with perfect vocals, and just the right mood.\n\nOn a totally unrelated note, I know a guy named Landon who plays guitar and has that same hairstyle. However his last name is not \"Pigg.\"","classification":5}

{"text":"The newest Deftones disc entitled \"Gore\" comes 3 and a half years after \"Koi No Yokan\", which I felt to be one of the best albums of the decade, along with \"Diamond Eyes\". It really felt like the band was at their peak with these two albums, so much so that \"Gore\" is being met with a lot of heavy expectation, especially after their original bassist Chi Cheng's death in 2013. And, although I don't know if this is their best album to date, \"Gore\" is yet another example of a band that sounds almost unmistakably consistent and unafraid to explore their sound like never before. Now, this album doesn't feature nearly as much of Stephen Carpenter as I expected (in fact, he at first didn't like the material conceived for this album), but what he is able to contribute is amazing. However, I feel like the real strength of this album is the songwriting. I feel like songs such as \"Prayers\/Triangles\", \"Hearts\/Wires\", \"(L)MIRL\", \"Phantom Bride\", and \"Rubicon\" are some of their most well written songs to date, and I feel like with some of these tracks the band may interest a new collection of fans. Chino's performance on this album is also exceptionally charismatic, especially on these tracks. Right now I would probably say that my favorite tracks are the five I just mentioned, and I also enjoy \"Xenon\", \"Acid Holorgram\", and \"Doomed User\". Overall, this is a Deftones disc so of course this is a fantastic effort, and is so far my favorite disc of 2016.\n\nRating: 97\/100","classification":5}

A sixth anthology, the rare Japanese release&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Greatest\/dp\/B0000087OZ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Greatest<\/a>, does go up to 1997, but even that is a little behind the times. In 2007, Paul issued a 3-DVD video retrospective,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-McCartney-Years\/dp\/B000VRJ37I\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The McCartney Years<\/a>, which contained music videos and live performances from 1970 to 2005. That set filled the gap quite nicely for its time.\n\nIn the liner notes for PURE MCCARTNEY, Paul states that its purpose was to provide a broad-based collection of songs from throughout his career, which people could enjoy in their car, at home, at a party, or wherever they happened to be. More likely, it was Concord Music requesting a best-of set; the ones listed above were all issued on Capitol\/EMI (except for&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-McCartney-Years\/dp\/B000VRJ37I\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The McCartney Years<\/a>, which was issued by Rhino Home Video\/Warner Strategic Marketing). UPDATE: PURE MCCARTNEY will be Macca's last Concord Music release; in mid-August 2016, Paul - much like the Prodigal Son - returned to his original label (not counting early U.S. Beatle releases on Vee-Jay, Swan, and Tollie), signing a worldwide multi-year deal with Capitol Records, now a Universal Music company.\n\nThe set does have a wide range, from 1970's \"Maybe I'm Amazed\" to 2014's non-LP track, \"Hope For The Future,\" which makes its CD debut here (though the alternate mixes on the 12\" single and digital download were not included). The 1984 British single \"We All Stand Together\" makes its U.S. commercial audio debut: a demo of the song appears on the 1997 Best Buy promo CD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Oobu-Joobu-Widescreen-Radio-Ecology\/dp\/B0002IW8QE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Oobu Joobu - Widescreen Radio - Ecology<\/a>.

Even with the bonus audio tracks on various CD album releases, Paul still has a lot of material that is only available on vinyl, out-of-print CD singles, or hard-to-find releases in distant markets, such as Japan.\n\nThere is also a less expensive&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/2-CD-edition\/dp\/B01DN253HG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">2-CD edition<\/a>&nbsp;available for the budget-minded. This 4-CD collection is in a nice hardcover book with plenty of archival photos. Not much text, though, except for Paul's intro, track listings, and production and publishing credits.\n\nBecause of the excellence and wide variety of the music, I'm still going to give PURE MCCARTNEY five stars, despite my mild criticisms.\n\nAnd Happy 74th Birthday, Sir Paul!

He is equally talented, as Eagle and as a solo artist.\n\nThe original recording of this song is very dynamic and engaging, and *most* of that shines through in this edition.  My digital audio workstation software reveals modest peak reduction, something which regretfully is done to most remasters and is done too aggressively, and combined with compression, on modern tracks since the late 1990s.  It is for that unnecessary processing I gave this item 4 out of 5, and not at all for the artistry of this song.\n\nFortunately, very little compression seems to have been applied to this version, beyond of course was applied during production originally over 3 decades ago.  Also, the \"waa-waah\" segment is left in at the end - what else would you expect from Joe Walsh?  :D","classification":4}

{"text":"I will admit that I was a strange kid in high school, but I do think that I had pretty good, if a little bit `mature,' tastes. Anyway, one day, I was flipping the channels, and I heard the beginning chords of this song. I, to be honest, didn't recognize the guy playing it. He was old, tall, lanky, and bald. But what a song it was. I was pretty overwhelmed by the poetry of the song (and how it renews itself--when I saw the attacks on the Twin Towers on 9\/11, my mind immediately heard that line from the song \"sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground\"), by the tragedy and love that shine throughout it (whose life hasn't been touched by fire and rain?), by the simple beauty of the melody, and by the performer's intensity as he sang it. Even if I was a stupid high school kid, I could recognize the song's sublimity.\n\nLater, I realized that the performance was at James Taylor's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction. I've never seen that performance since then, but I still remember it, and it did a lot to shape my tastes ever since. I did buy pretty well all of Taylor's early albums and still listen to them occasionally (they are fantastic--a lot of the more obscure songs are the very best). But Taylor prepared me to listen to the great music of some of the neo-folk talents writing and performing music right now (i.e. Mumford and Sons and, especially, The Avett Brothers, who come from Taylor's beloved North Carolina). So, this is still a wonderful song that has been meaningful to me for well over a decade.","classification":5}

That said, other singles from the effort never quite reached the same acclaim.  \"For Your Entertainment\" was scorned with controversy despite being well produced and catchy and the later released \"Strut\" never quite achieved the same airplay aspirations. Regardless, For Your Entertainment gave the American Idol Runner-up a top five album and a gold-certified effort.  He returns in top-notch form on the more tame, yet better all-around promo single from his second proper effort.\n\n\"Better Than I Know Myself\" does a fine job of reigning in the manic performer and bottling that energy into a commercial, yet enjoyable and authentic first single. Sure, the synths and electronic component of Lambert's music is still present, but producers better contain and reign in Lambert here, which makes \"Better Than I Know Myself\" so effective. There is a lack of the gimmickry that drives so much of pop music on this cut, which helps to give Lambert some extra, welcomed credibility as a musician and discourages the notion that he is just a product of the 'pop machine.'  The soaring chorus, which is incredibly catchy, allows for Lambert to show off his unbelievable range, which sets him apart from so many of today's less talented pop singers (many would kill to have the pipes Lambert does). Incredibly talented, hopefully his fine return to form on \"Better Than I Know Myself\" will help to lift his second album to higher heights than his first.","classification":4}

{"text":"For those of us who were teenagers in the 1960's the news of the sudden passing of Davy Jones a few years back came as quite a shock. For a couple of years in the mid 1960's the group known as The Monkees was nothing short of a national phenomenon. Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolenz and Michael Nesmith became household names virtually overnight. Their debut single \"Last Train To Clarksville\" was released in September of 1966 and would go all the way to #1 on the Billboard charts. That very same month \"The Monkees\" TV show debuted on NBC and just a few weeks later \"The Monkees\" LP was released and would go on to top the national charts for 13 weeks! Producer Don Kirshner would spare no expense in providing quality material for his sensational new group. The Monkees would record tunes by such notable writers as Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann, Neil Diamond and Carole King and Gerry Coffin to name but a few. Meanwhile, Kirshner also employed a number of the top studio musicians of the day to help to make these records. Over the next couple of years The Monkees would boast a total of a half dozen Top Ten singles and four #1 albums. Over the decades their most enduring recording continues to be the phenomenal 1967 hit \"Daydream Believer\". Here's to everyone who contributed to this record in any way (and there were a lot of people). This is the crme de la crme of 1960's pop.","classification":5}

{"text":"I had heard about this all-girls country super-star band, which includes country superstar Miranda Lambert, along with Ashley Monroe and Angaleena Presley, but I hadn't heard a single song, until now. I'm not particulary a country music fan to be honest, but I am a fan of great music, whatever the genre. The other day I was browsing my local library and curiosity got the better of me and I picked this up. Boy, am I glad I did!\n\n\"Hell on Heels\" (10 tracks; 30 min.) starts off with the title track, and the best track on here. The song is a delicious musical mash-up of country and sliding guitars reverb, and not to mention the choice lyrics (\"I'm gonna break me a million hearts\/I'm hell on heels\/Sugar daddy, I'm coming for you\"). After that, the album's musical vibe is more country-traditional, and that's fine, as it all sounds smooth and I really enjoy as the songs roll along. Several other outstanding tracks for me include \"Boys From the South\" and \"Trailer for Rent\" (with this rip: \"It's been ten years, ten thousand beers\/And he's still sittin right there on the couch\" OUCH!).\n\nAt 30 min., this album flies by in no time, and you'll play this again and again. This album is nothing short of a pleasant surpise to me. Would love to see these ladies live in concert at some point. Meanwhile, \"Hell on Heels\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4}

{"text":"I look at this kind of like Van Halen's latest studio album. Am I better off with it or without it? At the end of the day, I'd say with it. Obviously, it's not perfect. Would it have been better to have this in, say, 1985? Absolutely, yes. Unfortunately, 1985 was thirty years ago (holy crap, is my math right?), and this is the Van Halen we have today. The band itself sounds fantastic, Wolfie and all. Again, would I prefer Michael Anthony on bass and backing vocals? You bet I would. But that's not Van Halen 2015. The bottom line is if they were just unlistenable or embarrassing, I'd be the first to say pack it in, boys, you've reached the end of the line. But these guys still  have passion for what they do, and you can't deny the energy of their fans, or the energy of their songs. As others have noted, besides the band's playing, another saving grace here is the set list. Whether reviews of their concerts have been good or bad, nobody can complain about the songs they've been playing since they resumed touring with DLR. As far as the negative criticism, Dave has been bearing the brunt of it, and being honest, that's not an unfair point. He's not the David Lee Roth of the '80's, but in a way, he is. His goofball personality, his stage persona, his qualities as a frontman...even at his age, he still has it. And even though his vocal quality has unquestionably declined, he was always more of an entertainer than a singer, as most reviewers have acknowledged. This live release is for people who know exactly what Van Halen sounds like in 2015, are are okay with that. If you're expecting the '80's, dig out one of your old albums and give it a spin. But if you know how they sound today, and you like it, you should get some enjoyment out of this.","classification":4}

{"text":"\"Existence\" is another great installment of music that once again blends power with emotion.  One of the great things about this album is that the music is very new.  All 18 cues from \"Existence\" were pulled from a larger release titled \"Origins\" - that album debuted in October, but is unavailable for purchase by the public.  Audiomachine has plenty of popular catalog music they could release (and I hope they do), but I applaud them for putting their new music out there and having it stand on its own.  As a result, you may not recognize any of the music from existing trailers\/ad campaigns... but with the quality of the music being what it is, I'm sure you can expect to hear some of it used in future movie marketing campaigns.\n\nAt this point we can probably agree that Audiomachine is one of the great names in the Epic Score genre.  But I would say that they are quickly becoming my single favorite.  I have always appreciated their work, but now we are 6 public albums in and the music has been consistently great.  Most albums have 2-3 memorable tracks and the rest are disposable.  But I can find myself listening to Audiomachine's albums straight through and never getting bored - every track has something to offer.  That's not to say I don't have my favorites; in this case, they are \"Mission to the Unknown\" [Track 5] and \"Beyond the Clouds\" [Track 6].\n\nOverall, I like this album a lot - I think it will remain on my iPod for a long time.  I would say that Audiomachine's first public album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Chronicles\/dp\/B007RJSQYE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Chronicles<\/a>, is still my favorite of them all.\n\nNOTE: The Amazon MP3 version of \"Existence\" has 18 tracks.  The iTunes version has two bonus tracks for a total of 20 (although people are currently reporting playback problems with the iTunes-exclusive track \"Destination Earth\").","classification":4}

{"text":"\"Carry Me Back\", Old Crow Medicine Show's fourth studio album might well be their best album yet. There is no doubt that with every album they release OCMS is continuing to expand and take bluegrass music to an entirely different direction. This ain't Bill Monroe or Earl Scruggs kind of bluegrass. It is more like alt-bluegrass or even punkgrass but as I mentioned in my review on Old Crow's album \"OCMS\" this ain't your daddy's bluegrass.\n\n\"Carry Me Back\" is the liveliest album yet. The album kicks off in high gear right from the start with \"Carry Me Back To Virginia\" and then proceeds to take you through a range of slow pace then fast paced songs. And there is not a bad song in the bunch. This album really shows the range of music Old Crow can play. Plus with just about every member taking a turn as the lead singer on a song it really demonstrates just how accomplish a music group the band is. In many ways this album reminds me alot of their first studio album \"OCMS\". As in that first album you can tell the group is having a lot of fun in the recording studio and they play off each other well. As a result it is a total joy to listen too. The only difference is \"Carry Me Back\" is more lively and faster paced.\n\nFor us fans of OCMS it was shocking news to hear that the group was going on a hiatus a little over a year ago. I wondered just what was going on and if this might have meant the end of the group. During that time the band lost Willie Watson (which was sad news for me to hear since he was one of my favorites in the group) but they did regain Critter Fuqua one of the original members of the group who had left after they had released their album \"Big Iron World\". Any fears we fans may have had about the group has been put to rest with their newest album. They are not going away and in fact are coming back stronger then ever. Although he is no longer with the group Willie does appear on this album. Apparently his decision to leave came after recording the music for this album.\n\nIf you consider yourself a fan of OCMS then you got to get this album. You will not be disappointed. If you are someone who doesn't like bluegrass I say give this record a listen. Any conceptings you have about that style of music will be changed when you hear what Old Crow has done to bluegrass.","classification":5}

Tchaikovsky's inventive use of motifs, and his constant drive to use them to the last possible combination, were always exciting and interesting to me.  This album reminds me much of that first love.

{"text":"This is the self titled debut album by American rock band \"My darkest days\" originally released in 2010. The band is clearly influenced by the 80s glam metal and alternative scene; as I am not familiar with the modern rock subgenres and for that I will have to approach this album as an old school rock\/metal fan.\n\nGenerally the album includes equal amounts of hot rocking tracks and subtle\/radio friendly tunes. Therefore those who favor hard rock and glam\/hair metal will brobably be more attracted to songs like the opener \"Move your body\", \"Every lie\", \"Pornstar Dancing\", \"Goodbye\" and \"Set it on fire\" representing the heavier side of \"My darkest days\". The band consists of lead singer\/guitarist Matt Walst, guitarist Sal Costa, bass player Brendan Mc Millan and drummer Doug Oliver.\n\nOne has to also adress the guest appearances and contributions on this debut: Obviously the song \"Porn star dancing\" is their most recognisable rocker featuring mainstream rock star Chad Kroeger (who also co produces the album) and metal guitar legend Zakk Wylde. Still, the album benefits from songwriting contributions by lesser known, yet equally experienced, songwriters much like Harry Hess (\"Harem Scarem\") an authority in melodic rock\/AOR genre.\n\nIn terms of production one is glad to find out that the drums are granted a rather thick and sustained sound while the guitars are loud but overproduced at parts, loosing a good amount of their attack while one also expected more lead guitar parts and solos. Finally the vocals are thankfully all-clean and substantially melodic, a definite plus for the album.\n\nI have to say it was the beautiful cover artwork and flamboyant promo video of \"Porn Star dancing\" that drew me to \"My darkest days\" still it is doubtful whether this album would appeal to old school 80s rock fans beyond the heavier songs mentioned above.","classification":4}

{"text":"Much has been written over the years about the creative partnership between director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elfman. It now stretches back 25 years and encompasses such successful and well regarded films as Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns, Sleepy Hollow, Planet of the Apes, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, as well as the animated classic The Nightmare Before Christmas. Despite it having been repeated ad nauseum to the point that it's almost a clich, theirs is one of the most enduring and fruitful composer\/director collaborations in cinema today; the two men complement each other intellectually and stylistically, and clearly Burton's visual style brings out the best in Elfman's music. Alice in Wonderland is a prime example of this.\n\nBurton's take on the classic Lewis Carroll tale is an unusual one; he has explicitly stated that it is not a sequel, or a remake, or even a proper re-imagining, but instead takes all the familiar elements of the Alice story and churns them around into a curious new thing entirely. The film follows the adventures of young Alice Kingsleigh (newcomer Mia Wasikowska) a Victorian teenager who, after receiving an unwelcome marriage proposal, runs away; following a mysterious white rabbit, she accidentally falls down a rabbit hole and re-emerges in the magical land she visited as a child, although she has no memories of her adventures there years before. Through various encounters with the eccentric inhabitants of Wonderland, Alice discovers that since her departure the evil Queen of Hearts has usurped the crown and now rules wonderland with an iron fist, but fears Alice's return on account of a prophecy which says that Alice will slay the Jabberwocky, a giant dragon under the Red Queen's control, and in doing so will end her reign of terror. The visually overwhelming film, which was filmed in a combination of live action and 3-D animation, features a whole host of British and international acting talent in supporting roles, including Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen, Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter, Anne Hathaway as the White Queen, Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat, Matt Lucas as Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Alan Rickman as the Caterpillar, and Michael Sheen as the White Rabbit.\n\nDanny Elfman's writing style has altered considerably since he scored his very first film, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, in 1985. From his earliest days emulating his idols Nino Rota and Bernard Herrmann to his intellectual, pseudo-classical, occasionally minimalist recent work, over the years Elfman has grown into a \"proper\" composer of stature and technique, with an identifiable style and sound. Nevertheless, many consider his `golden period' to be the years between 1988 and 1995, beginning with Beetlejuice and ending roughly with Dolores Claiborne. Fans of his work often pine for these glory years of emotional themes, dark crescendos and fantastical whimsy, and although he has revisited the style briefly in a few scores here and there, Elfman has steadfastly moved away from his cooing choirs and twinkly orchestrations in favor of his new, more modernistic style. It is for this reason that Alice in Wonderland will be embraced wholeheartedly by his long-standing admirers, because it hearkens back completely to those wonderful scores of the late 1980s and early 1990s, more so than any other Elfman score in over a decade. It's a score replete with rich, lustrous melodies, moody minor-key chord progressions, magical orchestrations, innocently cooing boy's choirs, and even some thunderous action music that will make admirers of scores like Batman quiver in their pants.\n\nRather than take a multi-character leitmotif approach to the score (which composers on fantasy films often do), Elfman's three main themes are all for Alice: they represent her past, present and future, and intertwine throughout the length of the score, cleverly illustrating the story's central idea that Alice's long-forgotten history with Wonderland is influencing her present, and altering the course of its future. The main theme, heard in the opening \"Alice Theme\" is strong and memorable, with a driving rhythmic core, and a clipped, staccato vocal performance by a boy's choir. Performed by the full orchestra, with initial emphasis on lilting strings, the theme builds in scope and grandeur as it progresses, picking up a powerful brass section and booming percussion hits punctuated by Gothic pipe organ chords. The lyrics - apparently a last minute addition to the score by Elfman - are appropriately downbeat, and reflect further upon the film's themes of uncertainty, choice and fate: \"How can you know this way not that? You choose the door you choose the path. Perhaps you should be coming back, another day, another day\".\n\nThe second theme, for Alice's past, actually forms part of the bridge between verses of the main Alice theme in the opening cue, before receiving its first prominent performance in the second cue, \"Little Alice\", where it is performed by elegant woodwinds and dainty chimes. Attentive listeners will hear similarities between this theme and Elfman's theme for the 1994 film Black Beauty in the melodic progression and the vaguely Irish lilt, another pleasing throwback to Elfman's golden era. For much of the score the two themes for Alice and Little Alice intertwine with each other, inseparable, reminders of her past encounters with the Caterpillar and the Cheshire Cat and her new adventures in their company, although there are a couple of noticeably fuller statements, such as in the graceful \"The White Queen\".\n\nThe third theme is reflective of Alice's desperate future as a Victorian wife, a slightly stuffy and stately English waltz for prim woodwinds and plucked cellos. First heard in the third cue \"Proposal\", it is absent for a great deal of the rest of the album, featuring briefly in the lovely \"Only a Dream\", before reappearing prominently alongside the other two themes in the penultimate \"Alice Returns\" cue, signaling the end of her adventures in Wonderland and her arrival back in the real world... for now at least.\n\nAlice's theme appears frequently throughout the score, in different guises numerous cues. Each of the five \"Alice Reprises\" feature fragmented performances of one of the cue's verses, again performed by a cut glass boy soprano, while cues such as \"Down the Hole\" restate the theme in grand fashion. Later cues such as \"The Cheshire Cat\" see Alice's theme being performed in a more deconstructed fashion, while many of the late-album action cues feature the theme as a heroic motif for the battle ahead. In the epic \"Alice Decides\" Elfman places the Alice theme at the center of a massive call-to-arms, a cacophony of choral majesty and cymbal-crashing, organ-blaring fury that is almost Lord of the Rings-esque in its lavish scope and is quite wonderful.\n\nEven when he's writing slightly more abstract and unusual music, such as in the inebriated and unexpectedly Indian-sounding \"Drink Me\", the mysterious and moody \"Finding Absolem\", or the quite tortured-sounding \"The Cheshire Cat\", Elfman's music is never less than interesting. His orchestrations are clever and inventive, often working in supple electronic textures, cascading string effects, or layers of chimes under his orchestra, further enhancing his comparatively recent status of a composer who knows exactly how to manage his orchestra. Throughout it all, though, Elfman maintains the overarching sense of magical whimsy through the near-constant use of high register strings and the boy's choir, oohing and aahing a pleasing, dreamlike accompaniment.\n\nThe action music, of which there is quite a lot especially towards the end of the score, tends to be dense and quite busy, and more reflective of Elfman's more contemporary writing from scores such as Hellboy II or Wanted, although even here Elfman regularly interpolates snatches of thematic content, often to enormously satisfying effect. Cues such as the second half of \"Down the Hole\" and the gargantuan \"Bandersnatched\" are brutally exciting. \"Alice and Bayard's Journey\" grows into a majestic string and percussion march of dark and potent beauty, and \"Alice Escapes\" has a frantic energy and sense of momentum that is palpable, while the three-cue finale that comprises \"Going to Battle\", \"The Final Confrontation\" and \"Blood of the Jabberwocky\" is tremendous, working statements of both the main Alice and the Little Alice themes into a vibrant and heroic trio of cues that have the musical muscle to make your walls tremble.\n\nDanny Elfman hasn't written a score this thematically rich, this orchestrally robust, or with this many intentional allusions to his most popular works in many years, and as a result Alice in Wonderland is sure to be immensely popular with anyone who grew up listening to and loving the likes of Batman and Edward Scissorhands. What's even more impressive, however, is the knowledge that Elfman's the composer of intellectual authority is as much in play here as Elfman the enthusiastic newcomer; the vibrancy of the work, the structure of the themes, the cleverness of the orchestrations and harmonies, combined with the flavors of the past, make this score indispensible. Even by his own recent high standards, it's the best Elfman score in many years, and even at this early stage a contender for the best score of 2010.","classification":5}

{"text":"Although I've long meant to buy some of Sugarland's earlier albums, I haven't yet so this is my first album of theirs. It certainly reminds me that I really must buy those other albums. This is one of the more imaginative Christmas albums around, with several original songs and a sprinkling of old chestnuts, all done in typical Sugarland style. Jennifer Nettles sings most of the lead vocals, but Kristian Bush takes the lead on Holly jolly Christmas and Maybe baby New Year's day.\n\nAlthough Sugarland's music is rooted in country (some tracks actually utilize a steel guitar), it has a contemporary urban feel to it, clearly illustrated by the opening track, City of silver dreams. Traditional country songs usually contrast the big bad cities and the nasty people who inhabit them with the rural life that they acknowledge as tough but at least the people are nice, examples being Detroit city (Bobby Bare), I'm gonna be a country girl again (Buffy Sainte-Marie) and Big city (Merle Haggard). The opening track shows how far country songs have changed, as it pays enthusiastic homage to New York, including one verse about St Patrick's Cathedral and another about 5th Avenue. Instead of regarding New York as heartless and soulless, country singers now recognize that New York can be enjoyable.\n\nFollowing that opener are a couple of standards (Winter wonderland), which are given a distinctive Sugarland treatment but still stick to the basic original arrangement, so they should still sound reassuringly familiar enough to satisfy traditionalists. Next come three original songs. The first of these, Coming home, makes no reference to Christmas and could be about a homecoming at any time of year, but it certainly fits in here comfortably. The title track describes some of the good feelings of Christmas, while the sad song, Maybe baby New year's day, finds a man reflecting on how Christmas used to be with a woman who is only a memory.\n\nNuttin' for Christmas, a song first recorded by the Fontane Sisters, is a wonderful upbeat fun song that is rarely recorded. Next comes the standard O come O come Emmanuel, which Jennifer sings with the dignity it requires. A very stately song, the instrumentation includes two banjos, which is not exactly what one might expect, but they are played with great restraint while providing a distinctive touch. Nobody will mistake Sugarland's version of this carol for any other.\n\nThe last original song here, Little wood guitar, is about a Christmas gift given to a girl (Jennifer?) who eventual becomes successful. A great story song, it ranks alongside the opening track and the title track as one of the three best tracks here, although the entire album is brilliant. The album ends with an excellent bilingual version of Silent night.\n\nThis album took a few spins to grown on me, but I appreciated it more each time I played it. While the album is generally upbeat, I'm not convinced that it would work as party music, but it would be great at any other time of the festive season.","classification":5}

{"text":"I was never really familiar with the Jonas Brothers back in the day other than the fact that such a group existed, but I did blindly buy Joe's \"Fastlove\" album a few years ago and was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved it. Even now, I would say it's still one of the best CD's I've bought in the last five years. Naturally my interest was raised once again with Nick's latest solo effort after hearing the lead single \"Jealous\" on the radio, so I went ahead and bought that album as well. While I wouldn't go as far as to immediately rank it as one of my all time favorites, it's a solid record and one that probably won't be leaving the player for a while.\n\nI won't give a tedious track by track review, but any fan of catchy, uncomplicated pop music should find something to enjoy here as there's quite a bit of variety. Highlights for me include the bouncy \"I Want You,\" the tribal influenced \"Wilderness,\" and the 80's flavored throwback \"Teacher,\" but there really isn't a true dud in the bunch.  I was kind of expecting something a little more dance or electronic oriented, which we do get tastes of, for sure, but overall the disc maintains more of a smooth yet upbeat R&B style vibe reminiscent of a lot of mid-90's pop music, sprinkled with other influences throughout. While straightforward enough to be commercially safe and not alienate or put off any segment of listeners, there is still enough going on to keep it fresh and interesting in today's market. As for whether Nick truly is \"all grown up\" is debatable - this isn't exactly the most profound stuff you'll ever hear, lol - but he does share writing credit on most of the tracks and it's always admirable when artists have a hand in creating the product their names are attached to.\n\nI will say a quick word about the \"explicit\" content. Yes, he does drop the F-bomb in two or three songs (in a non-sexual context) but frankly, I doubt it's something that would jump out at you unless you made a point to go looking for it. That's just my opinion, but I know some people are concerned with that sort of thing, so take it as you will. Otherwise, like I said before, I think it's a great record any fan of pop music in general should enjoy. (My only complaint, if I absolutely had to make one, is that it runs a bit short - the standard edition barely breaks 38 minutes total.)","classification":5}

{"text":"Mark Knopfler is in fine form on this recording, which is full of songs crafted to be melodic and tell a story you'll want to hear told. Lots of \"trad\" sounding ballads on this one.\n\nA lot like the old Dire Straits in places too, if that is what you are looking for. Some quiet rockers, understated for the most part, many ballads.as I said earlier. One or two more hard-moving numbers. A couple of bluesey songs.\n\nKnopfler is at his mournful best on many of these songs, evoking the same vocal texture as on \"Private Investigations\" and \"Brothers in Arms\", which I consider his special strength as a singer. He has matured as a songwriter, but was always gifted in that department, able to spin fascinating lyrics on almost any subject. Here he is less cryptic than he has perhaps been (notably in places on Brothers in Arms and On Every Street).\n\nHis playing is, of course, virtuoso-level and he now has passed the need to show everyone that, making for understated brilliance. There's a particular joy in listening to someone who just knows how to play a given song for best overall effect (just as there's also a joy to hearing someone who gets paid by the note a-la Steve Howe or Django Reinhardt and someone who can take control and make you forget the other band components like Jimi Hendrix). It is a matter of mood for me.\n\nIn fact the \"feel\" of Privateering is very like Brothers in Arms (the album) for much of it, and I approve. I liked the Dire Straits sound and Knopfler evokes it here much of the time.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\n\nThe first track \"Redbud Tree\", a song in a minor key with a singable refrain, about a man on the run, \"Privateering\", a delightful call to all who would go adventuring on the Spanish Main,  and \"Corned Beef City\", a rocker telling the story of a trucker just squeaking by on one-day jobs.\n\nBut this album is one of those rare birds - one which has no \"clunkers\" for me. Picking favorites from such a collection is very hard.","classification":5}

{"text":"No need to go into what an incredible showman Frank Zappa and the Mothers were in any time period,any lineup change. The years 1973 and 1974 were extremely good years for Zappa. Not only had he released two commercially successful and creatively satisfying,but he had a band with personalities as energitic,eccentric and witty as himself in saxophonist Napoleon Murphy Brock and of course keyboard extraodinaire George Duke. Recorded live in Hollywood at the Roxy during both 1973 and Mothers Day 1974 shows there,this album was reissued on CD a few times before this,often remixing some of the songs (though Zappa itself makes it clear in the notes presented here many of the live tracks were overdubbed and remixed at the time anyhow). But all the same this documented the live experience of one of Zappa's most bountiful periods.\n\n  The album begins with \"Penguin In Bondage\",which Zappa introduces as one of his many songs with a sexual back round before going on into \"Pygmy Twyltye\" and specifically \"Dummy Up\",three of the most exciting funk style numbers FZ ever put his name to. The latter is especially fascinating in it's play between Zappa and Brock comically comparing contemporary high education to a drug habit.  \"Village In The Sun\" takes the groove to a slower,wonderfully reverbed kind of place as Zappa's intro reflects on the songs relation to his growing up. After this he heads into the spastic symphonic fusion of his classic \"Echidna's Arf\" before heading into the extend jazzier epic \"Don't You Ever Wash That Thing\". On \"Cheepnis\" Zappa's intro talks about is love of B-level monster movies on a witty and deliciously funky satirical number. \"Son Of Orange County\" and \"More Trouble Every Day\" offer up two more challenging jazz-rock numbers.\n\n  The album ends with my favorite number \"Be Bop Tango (Of The Old jazzman's Church)\" in which Zappa discusses modern day outlooks on human sexuality,it's relation to the tango and invites different people onstage to dance to George Duke's scatting,with some hilareous results. His conceptualisation here of what it is people are attuned to dance to in music illustrates a central point about this particular album. This album in many ways represents Zappa's live presentation when his music was likely at it's most funk oriented. Zappa's attitude,expressed on this albums closing number with Zappa instructing one of the dancers to loosen up rather than free their bodies,shows that his understanding of the funk era was actually quite high. Some might say this had to do with his exposure to George Duke and Napoleon Murphy Brock. Likely it was the other way though. Zappa always loved doo-wop and R&B. And continued to find ways to expand it to make it greasier in tone. So by providing that flavor himself,with intellectualy talented musicians much like himself  to help deliver that he had the perfect recipe for his own grooves and messages","classification":5}

{"text":"Fifteen years is a long time between albums, but the Bangles have successfully managed to avoid sounding either like ripoffs of themselves or like something totally alien. They are truly back in form, with the slickness factor turned way down from _Everything_ (though this is by no means _All Over The Place_, Volume 2).\nI am most impressed by the Peterson sisters' work on this album. I like Michael's \"Nickel Romeo,\" but her other songs here don't make much of an impression on me. Susannah sounds great as ever, but seems to be content mostly sticking to ballads (\"Something That You Said\", \"I Will Take Care of You\", \"Grateful\"). Not that these aren't great tracks, but she sounded great on the uptempo numbers from the early days--for example, the two bonus tracks on this album, both sides of the Bangles' first single. But Debbi turns in some of her best Bangles performances, period, on \"Ask Me No Questions\" and \"Here Right Now,\" and Vicki sounds great on \"Single by Choice,\" which I take not to be a defiant song of independence but something more akin to Simon & Garfunkel's \"I Am A Rock.\" And am I the only one who thinks she sounds like Shania Twain on \"Mixed Messages\"? As for \"The Rain Song,\" great stuff--but I have to say I liked the Continental Drifters' arrangement better. If only Vicki had been given the lead instead of Susan!\nThe ensemble vocals on \"Ride the Ride\" and \"Stealing Rosemary\" sound superb as well, and the instrumental playing is top-notch throughout. Vicki's mandolin is a nice touch.\nMy only criticism of this album is that it's a bit long. Not all of these songs are essential--I might have shortened 'Doll Revolution' by dropping \"Lost at Sea,\" \"Song for a Good Son,\" and \"Between the Two.\"\nI understand some of these songs have been floating around for years--indeed, some have been recorded and released before--so it will be interesting to see if the fifth album, if there is one, can measure up to 'Doll Revolution'. But even if it doesn't--who ever thought there would be a fourth?","classification":5}

{"text":"After four years since its release, \"Beneath the Surface\" has remained one of my favorite cds of all time. The cd is absolutely stunning with its blend of pop, new age,ambient, and trance music. The ethereal female vocals are equally gorgeous. The music reminds me of Enigma, Delerium, Conjure One, and Sleepthief. The music is totally soothing to listen to with its lush electronic beats. It is hard to pick a favorite song off the album. All of the songs on \"Beneath the Surface\" are wonderful. The last I have heard is that Balligomingo is currently working on a follow up album.

{"text":"Jennifer Hudson's departure from American Idol may have been one of the show's most shocking moments, yet it may have also enabled her career to take off. Without the overly restrictive Idol contract, Jennifer could take her time to craft a solid debut without pigeonholing herself into a single genre. News first came out that Jennifer had been instructed to change directions with the material, sparking some fears that this would prevent her from playing to her strengths, especially showcasing her incredible voice. Luckily, the final product kept its trendy-ness to a minimum while keeping an excellent balance between fresh sounds and showcasing the true talent.\n\nThe prime example would be lead single, \"Spotlight\", written by Ne-Yo and produced by Stargate. The track tells of an insecure boyfriend keeping tight reins to prevent Jennifer from finding someone better. While the production is impeccable, the focus is truly on the passionate yet controlled vocals as well as the honest lyrics. This was an excellent single choice, and an amazing way to start the album. \"If This Isn't Love,\" continues on in the same, radio-friendly vein that makes it an apt choice for the second single. It's another album highlight due to its heartfelt lyrics and stunning vocals. However, it is not quite as strong as the previous track but it's an excellent listen nonetheless. \"Pocketbook\" is a sassy, unexpected style featuring an interesting rap by Ludacris. This is one of the few tracks that received mixed reviews from fans, as it is generally seen as too \"ghetto\" for Jennifer. It does make for a welcome change from the slower pace of the majority of the album. The Robin Thicke penned \"Giving Myself\" is a decent ballad, which suffers most from its lack of anything truly memorable. While it is consistently an enjoyable, engaging song it tends to get lost among the other highlights. Nevertheless, as far as filler goes, this remains quite strong.\n\n\"What's Wrong\" with an unnecessary guest spot from T-Pain reeks of unfulfilled potential, although none of it is Jennifer's fault. Although Jennifer sounds beautiful, T-Pain's entirely computerized vocals make it sound as though Jennifer is singing with a robot. What could have been a beautiful highlight had it featured a better male vocalist ends up being mediocre at best. Luckily, the album picks up strongly with the incredible \"My Heart\". This is easily the most underrated track the album has to offer. The lyrics are nice and simple, but it is the vocal performance that really sells it. The subdued production makes a nice contrast with Jennifer's strong vocals, making it a true album highlight. \"You Pulled Me Through\" is one of the better Diane Warren ballads in quite some time. Like \"Giving Myself\", it remains a strong albeit somewhat unmemorable album track. This one is slightly better as it contains a stronger bridge, both lyrically and vocally. While there is nothing in particular wrong with the track, it unfortunately remains one step below true excellence. \"I'm His Only Woman\" is widely hailed as this decade's version of \"The Boy Is Mine\", although most would agree it is not quite on the same level. Jennifer sounds excellent, although duet-partner Fantasia's voice is more of an acquired taste. Given this however, the track as a whole works quite well although also fails to truly reach highlight status.\n\nIn contrast however, lies the other underrated gem \"Can't Stop the Rain\". The strength of this track lies in its overall passion, which is evident in everything from the production to the lyrics. This track tells of the death of a friend in an accident, and Jennifer's feelings about the girlfriend he left behind. Chillingly, she sings, \"somewhere in the deepest darkest piece of my mind, I wish it was her that died that night\". It's brutal honesty, yet it makes the song that much more believable. \"We Gon' Fight\" has some of the strongest vocals, which fit well with the gospel-esque tone. The track may get a little repetitive during the chorus, but the verses compensate for the most part. It picks up especially during the bridge when it becomes truly engaging, bordering on show-stopping at times. This becomes an interesting track in the end, as it starts out quite mediocre but builds toward a stunning climax. \"Invisible\" is the album's final hidden gem, featuring more subdued vocals which fit with the production impeccably. It seems to be a sort of follow-up to \"Spotlight\", where Jennifer declares her independence from an unsatisfying relationship. The only thing that would have improved this track would have been downplaying the background vocals slightly in the chorus, but that's rather a trivial complaint.\n\nAlthough many have pointed out that \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\" was pointless to include on this album, it would have seemed incomplete without it. This is the biggest song of Jennifer's career thus far, owing to her acclaimed role in Dreamgirls, thus it makes sense she would want to include it. It is a truly show-stopping song that showcases the full extent of Jennifer's vocals both in terms of power and emotiveness. \"Jesus Promised Me a Home\" has Jennifer returning to her Gospel roots mentioned in American Idol, although it comes across as somewhat out of place among the rest of the material. Jennifer sounds beautiful, and it's a nice song if you like Gospel. For the more secular fans however, it may be a little hard to connect with. Finally, \"All Dressed Up in Love\" from the Sex and the City soundtrack brings the album to a close on an excellent note. It's easily one of the most upbeat tracks, thereby hinting that Jennifer is capable of pulling off quicker tempos than most of this album has to offer. This is an unexpected highlight as well, thereby allowing the album end with a track nearly as strong as the one it began with.\n\nOverall Mark: 4\/5\n\n Jennifer Hudson has easily proved with this album that she left American Idol much too early, while simultaneously proving why it was better for her to be out of the competition. Unlike other Idol alumni, Jennifer has provided a rather consistent album that gives a defined sense of who she is as an artist. She remains one of the few who infuses their more radio friendly offerings with a message, or at the very least some sort of meaningful lyrics. With such a powerful voice, it would have been easy for Jennifer to go the middle-of-the-road route, and compile an album of very similar ballads that show off her technical skill but lack passion. Luckily, she decided to go the opposite route thereby securing her debut as one of the stronger offerings of the year, as well as hinting at significant quantities of potential for future albums of the same calibre.","classification":4}

{"text":"At least in my opinion, this is when their best era started. It's equal with Revolver and almost as good as Rubber Soul, the songs are more folk and rock rather than mainstream pop. They went their own direction here and their music gets more interesting along with the band writing better lyrics. The band shows some maturity in their songwriting but musically it's still very energetic like \"A Hard Day's Night\". You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, Yesterday, I Need You, It's Only Love and You Like Me Too Much are my highlights of the albums and some of The Beatles best songs. The entire album's great though and it's one of my personal favorites from The Beatles, their mid career is the best and Help! is their most underrated album of their career.","classification":5}
{"text":"Type O Negative's most recent album, \"Dead Again\" gets re-released and repackaged with a bonus DVD.  For those who have already picked up \"Dead Again\", this new edition is only worth picking up for die hard fans of the band.  The bonus DVD includes the live Wacken performances of fan favorites \"Kill You Tonight\", \"Love You to Death\", \"Anesthesia\", and \"Christian Woman\", along with the videos for \"The Profits of Doom\" and \"September Sun\".  An interview with the band is included as well, but it's nothing special, even though it concludes with Josh Silver touring Coney Island, which is actually pretty funny.  As for the album itself, you can check my old review for a more detailed take on it, but other than the DVD and new red colored cover, this is the same \"Dead Again\" that you picked up last year.  That's not a bad thing for more casual or new fans to the band who haven't picked up \"Dead Again\" yet, of which by all means this is the edition to pick up.  Other than that though, unless you are a die hard fan who needs to own everything Type O Negative, or you don't own \"Dead Again\" at all, this re-release isn't all that worth picking up.","classification":4}

{"text":"I Am The West doesn't have the attitude or focus that Raw Footage had. It's much lighter feeling and there are tracks that make you wonder where Cube's head was at when deciding what to put on the disc. Still Cube can bring it when he is focused, as evident on tracks like \"Hood Robbin\". Cube is graced with some great verses from the reliable WC on \"Life In California\" and \"Too West Coast\", both of which are also standouts. \"I Rep That West\", \"Drink The Kool-Aid\", and the fiery \"No Country For Young Men\" round out the must haves for the disc. Tracks to avoid at all costs are \"It Is What It Is\", \"All Day Everyday\" and \"Fat Cat\", all of which are repetitive garbage. The rest are listenable, including the hated by many \"Urbanian\", which I find humorous if nothing else. Overall, not one of the better Cube cds, but a must own for the diehards such as myself. It's still better than most of the crap out there.","classification":3}

Her last album \"Safe Trip Home\" was good but its songs did not have lasting impact as they all seemed to be slow placed and moody. No suprise, as Dido was dealing with the death of her beloved father and the break up of a long-term relationship...\n\nNow Dido is in a much better place, happily married with a child and the songs on \"the Girl Who Got Away\" are some of the best she has ever written & created. I've been listening to the extended 2 disc version for over two weeks now (it was released in England earlier this month) and can honestly say its as good as her debut \"No Angel.\"\n\nHere you find radio and club friendly tracks like \"Let Us Move On\", \"\"Blackbird\", \"The End of Night\", and \"Let's Runaway\"\namong others whose chorus will stick in your memory long after the tracks are over. There is something for everyone and I expect both old and new fans will support this new release.\n\n\"No Freedom\" is a good track but a poor choice as a first single as many music critics cited this as an example of how Dido is playing it safe and how all her songs sound the same. It could have been released on any of her previous two cds. Fear not, as this is perhaps one of her 'weakest' tracks on the album and is not a good indicator of what lies ahead..","classification":5}

{"text":"Nostalgia has been a cornerstone of M83's career since the beginning. With the 1980s being a particularly ripe era for nostalgia these days, it only makes sense that the French electronic\/indie band's latest album, \"Junk,\" takes inspiration from the years that seem to have informed their sound and aesthetic the most. If you felt a twinge of sadness when you learned that George Gaynes had passed earlier in the year, or if you remember a time when Dic productions ruled the TV set, \"Junk\" may be the album for you.\n\nIt would be hard to talk about \"Junk\" without comparing it (admittedly unfavorably) to 2011's mammoth double-disc \"Hurry Up, We're Dreaming.\" Band leader Anthony Gonzalez aimed to outdo himself (and perhaps his peers) with the aforementioned album and succeeded in big, booming ways. Five years later, and the release of the tepid first single, \"Do It, Try It\" and it's hard not to feel disappointed at first. However, \"Do It, Try It\" appears to be a red-herring, meant to downplay any expectations, since the album quickly picks up speed with the caffeinated power-anthem \"Go!\". Teasing a little bit of that signature sax from prior hit, \"Midnight City\" before dipping into an absolutely infectious chorus from guest vocalist Mai Lin (who appears on two later tracks), it's made clear that the M83 we have come to love hasn't died or gone dormant, it's just taken on a new form.\n\nSpeaking of new, newbie band member Jordan Lawlor gets to take lead vocal duty on the smooth summer breeze of \"Walkway Blues,\" injecting some energy into the band's music while Gonzalez takes a backseat in the vocal department. Likewise, \"Time Wind\" allows Beck (yes, THE Beck) to lead the group through one of the high points on the album. Having proven himself to be one of the most diverse musicians of his generation, Beck slides into the slipstream so effortlessly, it makes one desire an M83-produced Beck album immediately (seriously, somebody make this happen!)\n\nLike a bowl of cereal sitting in one's lap for too long during a Saturday morning cartoon binge-watch, bits of \"Junk\" tend to get a bit soggy. While brevity has never been M83's thing, the album leans on the overly-long side and starts to feel a little samey in the last third. Even still, the peaks overwhelm the valleys and while it doesn't always flow as well as the three albums preceding it, there are a number of gems in \"Junk\"'s trunk. So strap on a pair of Moon Boots, ready the Lik-M-Aid and transport yourself back to a time when the \"Ghostbusters\" tearing up your local multiplex were a bunch of dudes, and enjoy the time wind.","classification":4}

{"text":"I excitedly pre-ordered \"Prism\" by Katy Perry (deluxe version) due to my previous music enjoyment of \"Teenage Dream\" (from 2010) and a strong intuitive feeling to purchase this collection. I am glad that I followed my psychic hunch because many of these songs are happy and symbolize a message of cheerfully relishing  various facets of life.  There is something for many men and women in \"Prism\" such as the being unstoppable and resilient in life through the song \"Roar\" and being in love with someone who is a kindred spirit to you: such as through the music track \"Double Rainbow\".  Obviously, I'm fully aware that personal song favorites are going to be as varied as the listeners of \"Prism\".  My personal favorites are \"Birthday\", \"International Smile\", \"Dark Horse\", \"Legendary Lovers\" and \"Walking On Air\".  However, there are many more music tunes to enjoy on \"Prism\" such as \"Unconditionally\", \"This How We Do\", \"This Moment\", \"By The Grace Of God\", and \"It Takes Two.\" \"Prism\" (deluxe version) by Katy Perry is definitely recommended if you enjoyed Katy Perry and\/or you like music collections sprinkled with pop, hip-hop, and eurodance melodies.","classification":5}

With the opening lines of the title of the song sung that reads almost like a letter and greetings, Regina Spektor shows how the importance of music can translate and reach many regardless of what time or place in which the listener may happen to hear this song.  Its melody and symbolic lyrics communicate in so few words along with the special effects that rear in the background of the sound of New Year's revelers but also the irony of other sounds that invoke another meaning that resonates similarly to the traditional ode to the past and welcome to the soon present of \"Auld Lang Syne.\"\n\nSpektor does a good job to show the greater significance of things past and true with the beauty of a song.

I would say this album is a bit more straight forward than their previous stuff. Their past albums, especially on \"Hurry Up, We're Dreaming\" it felt like all the songs flowed together and we're one collective piece but this new album feels very all over the place which can be a good and bad thing. It's obvious the group is trying to release a more radio-friendly record which once again, can be a good or bad thing. Point being, some tracks are great and some aren't.

I think there are people who are going to honestly hate this. But I encourage everyone to at least try it even if its not your typical cup of tea.

On the surface it's all about having your brain physically plugged into the internet. On a deeper level it's got some pretty serious philosophy going on. And it's all set to some great energetic music.\n\nWhere I Belong was the only track that didn't thrill me. It was the music.

{"text":"Eightball & MJG have long been staples in the Southern hip hop scene, flying just under the radar of national acclaim with every release.  Even with a handful of singles and guest appearances and years of making classics and hits they still haven't 'blown up'.  Now seems to be the time for them as they have the marketing talent of P. Diddy and Bad Boy South this time out.  And this time there's no excuses.\nRight out the gate Eightball & MJG show that these are the same ol boys from Memphis with 'You Don't Want Drama', a menacing club track with aggressiveness we haven't heard from them since 'Lay It Down'.  Now THIS is a comeback track, letting people know that can hang in today's industry.  They get down with Bun B on 'The Streets', which is arguably the best song on the album.  Eightball delivers the tightest verse and the beat is beyond greatness.  Shot Off feat. Ludacris is also a 5 star track with another magnificent beat and gangsta flows from everybody.  Look At The Grillz has Twista, TI, and Eightball & MJG completely ripping it up; especially Twista.  They spit over a thumping Lil John beat (no adlibs).  THis is destined to be a classic down south.  Forever feat. Lloyd is insanely tight.  When I first saw this collaboration, I thought it would be sappy because Lloyd is kind of a new school Ralph 'Sensitivity' Tresvant.  Not that that is bad, I love some Ralph Tresvant, but it didn't seem like it would work for the album.  But it does...perfectly.\nEvery friggin song is off the chain.  Just check the gangstaness of When It's On, or the crunkness of 'Don't Make', or the flyness of Trying To Get At You, or the introspectiveness of Confessions.  Whatever these boys touch on the album is pure gold.  This album ranks as one of Ball & G's best, right up there with On Top Of The World & In Our Lifetime Vol. 1; it's that good.  The only problem I have is the interludes and the fact that they didn't rap over the 'Get A Kit' beat, that would have been a vintage, classic Ball & G ridin track.  What were they thinking?  But Anyway, this album is easily a must have for 2004 and beyond.  One of the year's best! 5 stars.","classification":5}

{"text":"Its bizarre. Linkin Parks bizarre, that is. Not just their genres, or their albums, or their music videos, or their songs, but the phenomenon that IS Linkin Park. Since the late nineties, there hasn't been a band as disagreed upon as Linkin Park has been. People criticized them for screaming too much in Hybrid Theory and Meteora; they didn't scream or rap enough in Minutes to Midnight; A Thousand Suns, which blended reggae and rock and hip-hop, was too weird or political (but the naysayers said it was Techno, which is apparently a criticism); Living Things was too dub-steppy (even though the folk elements were prominent too); and The Hunting Party will probably be too loud and aggressive. Linkin Park cant win, but they will make great music to the unbiased ear. Thats all that matters.\n\nThe Hunting Party is heavier than Hybrid Theory and its better than Living Things. This is what youve been waiting for Hybrid Theory fans (you know, you guys that claim it isn't about Nu Metal, but rather about heavy, aggressive music). With that being said, this is probably Linkin Parks most important album in the last ten years. This is where we discover whether the naysayers have any merit in their overly hatefulor forcefully indifferentcriticisms . . .\n\nThis is Linkin Parks loudest, rawest, most visceral album to date. If Living Things was a mixture of all their previous albums, The Hunting Party purges out their previous sounds. Like Minutes to Midnight, its another clean slate. A new sound. As Mike raps about in the first track on the album, Careful what you shoot for, cause you might hit what you aim for. You wanted heavy, you got heavy; youll be thirsty for the two mellower songs toward the end of The Hunting Party, because the mayhem which comes before will scorch the sonic landscape of this album . . .\n\n1 \/ Keys to the Kingdom  3\/5\n\nYoud be wrong if you assumed Linkin Park put their heaviest song in the very beginning, although it would be an easy mistake. It starts off relentlessly heavy; loud guitars; louder vocals. Whats also interesting is the structure of the song. One verse is sung, the next verse is rapped. Kudos for Linkin Park mixing it up.\n\nOne Word Summary: Electric\n\n2 \/ All For Nothing (featuring Page Hamilton)  4\/5\n\nThis song reminds me of why I used to like Hip Hop (Talib Kweli, Mos Def, and The Roots) in the late 90s, early 2000s. While Page Hamilton is a guest singer on the song, he doesnt steal the show; its all about Mike Shinodas rapping force. He doesnt play around, doesnt sugarcoat the lyrics, doesnt make it have a pretty rhythmhe just fires it out. The chorus, sung by Page and Chester, is also very catchy and anthemic.\n\nOne Word Summary: Anthem\n\n3 \/ Guilty All The Same (featuring Rakim)  4\/5\n\nIm sure most of you already have an opinion on the song. They were smart to have it be their first single, because if you don't like this song, you very likely won't like 70 percent of the album.\n\nOne Word Summary: Sampler\n\n4 \/ Summoning (instrumental)  N\/A\n\nIt would be pretentious to score a 1 minute instrumental, but lets just say it feels like something from A Thousand Suns.\n\n5 \/ War  4\/5\n\nI have a feeling that a lot of people will like this song because of how loud and aggressive it is. Its a better song than Living Things Victimized, fusing rock and punk. This is the heaviest song on the album.\n\nOne Word Summary: Heavy\n\n6 \/ Wastelands  5\/5\n\nThis is the first song on the album that feels like a Linkin Park song. And thats a good thing for a Linkin Park fan. Its familiar territory; its a sonic haven; and it might just be Mike Shinodas finest rapping to date.\n\nOne Word Summary  Exhilarating\n\n7 \/ Until Its Gone  5\/5\n\nIts interesting they placed Wastelands and Until Its Gone back to back. While Wastelands feels like something from A Thousand Suns or Living Things, Until Its Gone really resonates to a sort ofdare I say it?Nu Metal quality from their first two albums, from lyrics to the music. Its also the first ballad on the album. If you're listening to this album from beginning to end (like you should), youll really appreciate this song, like finding an oasis in a desert.\n\nOne Word Summary: Throwback\n\n8 \/ Rebellion (featuring Daron Malakian)  5\/5\n\nIf it wasn't for having the catchiest chorus on the entire album, well, it would probably still be a 5\/5. This song also features one of Daron Malakians best guitar performances ever. If we were still in the nineties, this would be a massive single, since it feels so much like a Nu Metal song, but were not, so it won't be. Shame.\n\nOne Word Summary: Catchy\n\n9 \/ Mark the Graves  5\/5\n\nThis song here will be polarizing. Most Linkin Park albums, you could make a single out of every single song on the album. However, with Mark the Graves, it isn't single material. Its kind of offbalanced with too much guitar solos and not enough singing (kind of like Roads Untraveleds loudmouth cousin), but its quite an organic song. Its a risky song.\n\nOne Word Summary: Experimental\n\n10 \/ Drawbar (Tom Morello)  5\/5\n\nOkay, yes this is an instrumental. And no, Im not that familiar with Rage Against the Machine. But it deserves a score (unlike Summoning), because it really captured something inside of me. It felt like a musical piece you would hear in PS3s The Last of Us. Its experimental and moody and defines what Linkin Park is all about.\n\nOne Word Summary: Moody\n\n11 \/ Final Masquerade  5\/5\n\nYou could put this song on any of their albums and it would work. This is the softest song on the album and will be the only song that your mother would probably like (unless she likes really, really loud music). Its cut from the same thread as In Pieces, and it was clearly made to balance the albums heaviness, and as a transition into the final, craziest song of the album . . .\n\nOne Word Summary: Beautiful\n\n12 \/ A Line in the Sand  5\/5\n\nThis might be considered the spiritual successor to The Little Things Give You Away, and for good reason. It not only captures the essence of the entire album, but it also makes a solid point; its the thesis of the album; the apotheosis of the statement they were making with The Hunting Party. A Line in the Sand is the longest song on the album, and the most satisfying. Unless you were familiar with Linkin Park, you probably wouldnt know it was them until Mike starts sort of rapping.\n\nOne Word Summary: Masterpiece\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThe Hunting Party is a mean, jerky rollercoaster that isn't comfortable; its not hiking, its mountain climbing for your earsyoull appreciate when you get to Final Masquerade, which is the only mellow song on the album.\n\nYOU WILL probably like this album if you like bands like System of a Down, Metallica, Avenged Sevenfold, and early Deftones.\n\nWARNING: This album is NOT your friend. Hybrid Theory and Meteora may have provided you're the tissues to wipe your tears, but The Hunting Party will kick your a** and tell you to suck it up and toughen up.\n\nPROS:\nAlbum Concept\nAlbum Length\nEpic Guitar Solos\nEnergy\nBetter Than LIVING THINGS\nBest Song(s): Final Masquerade, A Line in the Sand\n\nCONS:\nCould Have Had One More Song\nTom Morellos Underdone Presence\nRakims Overdone Presence (Mike and Rakim shouldve alternated)\nNot Quite as Interesting as A THOUSAND SUNS\nDoesnt Contain Any Massive Singles\nWorst Song(s): Keys to the Kingdom","classification":5}

Who gave you the right to shake my family tree, the controversial King Of Pop asks rhetorically, Tell me; are you the ghost of jealousy? Hes apparently addressing his many detractors, but the point is nearly lost in the groove.\n\nThe beat, produced by Teddy Riley, is as cold as the concept, and the bridge conjures 1970s funk, but its the aforementioned chorus; not the words themselves, but their harmonic melodies; that haunts. Its a majestic masterpiece; one of the best Ive heard, in my life, from Michael Jackson or anyone else.

{"text":"'Help' is easily a pleasing, yet less substantial classic in their repertoire.  The hits are formidable, including the title track (another Lennon confessional that proves he wasn't just satisfied with being the top of the pops) and also \"Ticket to Ride,\" and \"Yesterday\".  The overall effect is mellower than some of their other offerings, but even with the folk influences that came from Dylan and others in 1965, they manage to keep the electricity pumping.  The fun of the film and the spirit of this soundtrack are formidable, whether folk-rock or not.  \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\" is a substantial Dylan imitation, but \"It's Only Love\" shows John to himself being true.  McCartney also puts in a fine, upbeat folk ballad with \"I've Just Seen a Face\".\n\nThough every Beatles' album seems to have a mood or focus, 'Help' doesn't just fit the mold of folk rock.  McCartney offers a fine rock ballad \"The Night Before,\" with simple, but pointed lyrics. Lennon, however, gets more direct with \"You're Going to Lose that Girl\".  Subjectively, \"I Need You,\" is a fine George Harrison song, complete with his best lyrics to this date.  Ringo adds variety by extending the country-rock genre from their previous album, 'The Beatles for Sale' with \"Act Naturally,\" a song lyrically matched just for him.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the album isn't as strong.  The other offerings are pleasant, but not as important lyrically or musically.  Nevertheless, \"Tell Me What You See\" and \"You Like Me Too Much\" are engaging enough to recommend this C.D.  Of course, \"Yesterday,\" is either the clincher or the linch-pin.  Like the title track, it tends to be taken for granted, but few pop songs have ever been as haunting as \"Yesterday\".  A rift may have developed in the band, for it is significant that the album ends not with \"Yesterday,\" but with \"Dizzy Miss Lizzy,\" their only remake.  Undoubtedly, Lennon had his two cents worth about what the band meant musically. Oddly, it does seem to be a poor transition from pop to rock, especially from the Beatles.  Without the strife, however, we wouldn't have the variety we love from the greatest band ever assembled.","classification":5}

{"text":"I'm going to do something that some of you out there reading might consider highly unusual.  I'm going to pick this song apart and explain why each and every part of it is so irresistibly awesome.  \"Reflections\" might just be the greatest song Diana Ross & the Supremes ever released.  This song must have come on the radio a million times throughout the country over the years, and I wouldn't mind listening to it a million times myself.  Here we go!\n\nIt starts off on an unusual note for the first few seconds with swirling machinery-type sounds that seems totally out of place at first but now that I've heard the song so many times, I believe these chaotic sounds are supposed to represent the confusion and emotional distraught that Diana Ross feels through her rollercoaster emotional state of mind.\n\nThen Diana Ross begins to sing... and her voice *alone* is brilliant.  It sounds so tender with *just* the right hoarse sound.  Like a young woman who's finally had enough of having someone hold her down, so she's going to stand up and express exactly how she feels.  Like she's on stage and it's her turn to speak, or sing in this case, what's on her mind.  I actually never noticed she had a hoarse voice until recently and it's more noticeable in her early days when she was younger.  I LOVE it!\n\nThen we have the Supremes providing the really somber and suspense-building \"ooooo, oo-oo-oo\" behind Diana's powerful vocals.  Listen to the perfectly executed way the \"oooo\" dreamily soothes and creates tension during the way Diana sings the line \"Through the mirrors of my mind, through these tears I am crying\".  With the Supremes providing back-up, now this song takes on a whole new meaning.  Without the Supremes Diana's vocals would have been great as it is, but WITH the Supremes?  Now it's just insanely good!\n\nWhat proves this band had a knack for totally absorbing into your emotional state of mind is perfectly summed up in the way Diana sings the line \"I'm all alone now, no love to shield me, trapped in a world of distorted reality\".  Suddenly, during this particular line, the song shifts in a VERY different direction as Diana stands alone.  What was once suspenseful tension building courtesy of both Diana Ross and the Supremes NOW feels like someone who's soul has been crushed to the point that whenever they think about their past, they feel cold and angry.  If my words aren't clear, this is one EXTREMELY powerful tempo change but the lyrics tell a story with such ease that it's easy to not acknowledge what a spectacular moment of the song this is.\n\nIt took me a LONG time to notice there's a speedy bass section playing in the background, and what appears to be a violin or string section playing a few notes rapidly for a few seconds during the above mentioned tempo change.  It's brief and easy to not notice unless you're playing REALLY close attention.  And how about the orchestration at the 1:50 mark?  It's now very demanding and seems to illustrate Diana's emotions all coming to a head and she's either on the verge of a nervous breakdown or realizing that she needs to ditch her troubled past as soon as possible.  This is ANOTHER really powerful moment.  Granted, my interpretation probably isn't the same as Diana's, but that's okay- we all interpret music differently.\n\nThe song finishes on a more optimistic note with dramatically more promising vibes the way Diana Ross demandingly sings \"Reflections of, the way life used to be\" with a pounding rhythm illustrating a brighter future.  The tone of the song right here at this point seems to paint a picture of someone who's learned to move on from a troubled relationship and won't dare repeat the same mistakes again.\n\nAnd just to throw in some humor, it's fun to misinterpret a line near the end that is a popular misheard lyric- \"In the UFO!\"  No Diana is actually saying \"In the you and I\" and the Supremes providing their own vocals makes it easy to misunderstand what is actually being sung here.  BUT!  If you consider the odd sound effects that appear on at least two occasions (in the beginning and when Diana sings the line \"happiness you took from me and left me alone with only memories\" and the line near the end \"I see a dream that's lost from the hurt you have caused\") you could actually be led to believe she's singing about UFO's, haha.\n\nSo what is it about \"Reflections\" that is so magnificent?  It's that it goes through many emotional shifts in such a way that for 3 glorious minutes leaves you completely stunned.  Sadness, optimism, worry, fear, deserted... these are just some of the feelings I experience.  If you love the song as much as I do and hopefully you do, you should be able to detect all these emotions and more!  Most artists could spend their entire careers creating something with as much emotion that Diana Ross & the Supremes summed up honestly in one 3-minute song, and that my friends is downright amazing.","classification":5}
{"text":"I should preface this by pointing out I'm one of those Beach Boys people.  While their heyday was before I was born, when I was an intern software engineer, a coworker dropped a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Pet-Sounds-Mono-Stereo-Remasters\/dp\/B008LA7RM0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pet Sounds (Mono & Stereo Remasters)<\/a>&nbsp;on my desk with a promise it would change my life.  Sounded like hyperbole to me, but he was right.\n\n15 years later, I still continue to be floored by the Beach Boys, and \"Made in California\" proves it.  The modern trend of mixing previously released material with unreleased tracks does seem frustrating, but the set as is provides a fine career overview, from the band's earliest days to their latest reunion.  Many excellent songs, whether commercially successful (\"Don't Worry Baby\"), critically adored (\"Surf's Up\") or underappreciated (\"All This is That\") make their appearance.  We get brilliant sun-and-fun cuts (\"Surfin' USA\"), achingly beautiful ballads (\"Caroline, No\") and music as high art (\"Surf's Up\").  Throughout, the genius of Brian Wilson (and his band mates) is widely on display, and is clearly intact into its fifth decade, nicely represented by 2012's magnificent \"Isn't It Time\".\n\nFor the diehard fan, this collection features an assortment of rarities and live tracks, some of which we've heard before, but many we haven't that become essential listening immediately (notably Dennis Wilson's \"(Wouldn't It Be Nice To) Live Again\", Brian's \"Sherry She Needs Me\" and the return of \"Guess I'm Dumb\" to the Beach Boys oeuvre).  I was also happy to have live tracks from the '93 acoustic sets (now if only the whole show could see release!) and elsewhere.  Certainly dozens of unreleased and rare tracks help heal the sting of the expensive price tag.\n\nThe book accompanying the album takes a slightly different tact then most, presenting the Beach Boys' history in quotes from the band.  It isn't the sort of essay we've generally seen in sets like this, and really that's a good thing.  It makes for a fun experience easily digest while listening to the set.\n\nFor me, this set hits all the right notes.  I'm glad to have it.  Highly recommended.","classification":5}

{"text":"I love this album.\nI love The Killers but didn't automatically go out and get this. the initial reviews were poor and like a fool I listened to them - even though I loved Crossfire.\nOnly The Young came out and I wasn't fussed on it. But then I was. It reminded me of Queen. Now I love it.\nMagdalena was supposed to be a good track so I sampled that. Liked it.\nWent out and got the Deluxe Edition and kicked myself for not getting it earlier and letting total strangers talk me out of getting it.\nFlamingo doesn't have the stadium sound that the first two Killers albums have but it's not a band album, it's solo and it's very imtimate.\nThe Killers Day and Age (their best in my opinion) toned the rock down a notch and Brandon's toned down even further here.\nWe're left with a bunch of personal songs that are catchy and dynamic.\nThere are Killers flavors of course but a Killers album couldn't be this heart felt.\n\nWelcome To Fabulous Las Vegas is a great sweeping opener.\nOnly The Young is an awesome track. It has many layers and a welcome break form the standard pop\/rock fare that hits our airways.\nHard Enough doesn't do a lot for me. It's one of two weak ballads on offer\nJilted Lovers is highlight. Probably the song closest to The Killers.\nPlaying With Fire is the other weak track. A bit country. Does build but donesn't go far.\nWas It Something I Said? is a cracker. Poppy and massively catchy.\nMagdalena is a up great up tempo ballad\nCrossfire is just awesome\nOn The Floor is a slow burning corker. Took some getting into initially but is a favorite - one of many including\nSwallow It which is a another corker. (Corker is a good thing by the way if you're not used to that expression)\nI feel bad for anyoe who doesn't have the Deluxe Edition because two of the four songs are just brilliant and the other two are great.\nThe Clock Was Tickin' took some getting into (for a non-country liker it was very off putting at first) but when you listen to the lyrics, it just hits you and hooks you in. Right Behind You reminds me of early 80's Robert Palmer and is one of the best songs on the whole album. I can't believe it was left off the initial 10 track selection. Truely brilliant song.\nJacksonville and I Came Here To Get Over You are the other two bonus track and are both worthy additions. I Came Here is a great track also. Catchy. Has a Bob Dylan vocal thing going on in the middle. Lesser so Jacksonville, which is a great bonus track but not really album worthy (given the other material here - for the majority of other artist it would be worthy).\n\nDon't compare to The Killers (hard I know) but buy it as a stand alone release.","classification":4}

{"text":"(Courtesy of Amazon Prime Music)\nFive NASCENT Stars! Of all of the hundreds of vocal versions of the Henry Mancini\/Johnny Mercer composition, \"Moon River\", over the years, perhaps the simplest, most effective, and affecting is the very first version which was sung by Audrey Hepburn. Strumming her guitar with violins and celeste in the background during 'the fire escape scene' with George Peppard in the movie \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\", she nailed it vocally. And the song was in danger of being cut from the movie until Mancini and especially Hepburn fought hard to keep it in and, as they say, the rest is history: winning 2 Grammies for Song and Record of the Year, an Oscar, and enjoying great popularity ever since. Sung simply and sweetly, Hepburn is excellent in telling her believable tale about love, hope, wonder, and a river, in one pass through the lyrics. Mancini himself calls this his favorite version of the song. \"My huckleberry friend\", indeed! My Highest Recommendation. Five MEMORABLE Stars. (RCA Victor records.

{"text":"I remember being little, maybe 6 or 7ish when this song came out on the radio in the early 80s (the band was formed in 1981). I also remember hearing it for the first time at my older friends birthday party on the new boom box that he had just received as a gift. I still remember this moment as one of the coolest experiences and moments in my life. I mean in the early 80s run dmc was IT!! I love all of their stuff especially the super iconic \"walk this way\" with the band Aerosmith. If history and memory serve me, I believe that this was the first collaborative project between a quintessentially rock n roll band and a hip-hop, rap group. I never knew back then that I would be making music history for now. I feel honored and privileged that God let me be there and experience it first hand. as for run DMC, it was made up of three influential rappers, performers from Hollis Queens, NY. these members were Joseph \"Run\" Simmons, (yes, younger brother of the famous promoter, business mogul, Russell Simmons), Darryl \"D.M.C.\" McDaniels and Jason \"Jam Master Jay\" Mizell (who is now deceased). little did they know growing up in Hollis that they would be hip-hop and music pioneers. they were the first hip-hop group to do many things that previous groups, hip-hop or not, were not privileged enough to do. they were the first to have videos on MTV, the first hip-hop group to be on the cover of rolling stone magazine, the first to have a hip-hop album go gold and the first to be nominated for a music grammy award and the list goes on and on. my favorite was their appearance on the show \"american bandstand\" hosted by the legendary dick clark. I know because i never missed an episode:) lastly, their tremendous influence on music and pop culture was cemented in 2009 when they were inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame. (the only other rap group to do so was Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.) personally, i can't give enough accolades to the group. I just know that they surely don't make music groups like this anymore. with \"its tricky\" I was able to enjoy the \"fresh\" ride back to the early 80s when rap was new and genuine- no fakes here!! it was nothing but good memories, I say!! I wish I could bring them all back! purchase a sample of music history and enjoy!!!","classification":5}
{"text":"First off I want to say I love Dream Theater their one of my favorite bands. Got into them a couple of years ago. Slowly collected their albums at used cd stores and Amazon. My favorite albums by them are the albums (Train of thought, systematic chaos, black clouds silver linings, and awake)  that were their a little heavier (because I'm a metal head). But saying that I love all of their albums and just love the diversity in the music. I do think the quality of the music has gone down a little bit since Mike Portnoy left but that's my opinion, even though they still put out solid albums. So I'm always excited when they put out a new album. So get the Astonishing. I've only listen to it a couple of times so I'm giving this review without it growing on me over time so my mind might change in a couple of years. Well I'm a little disappointed but it's still a very solid release. It is a concept album telling a story. It really reminds me of a modern The Wall (Pink Floyd) mixed with 2112(Rush) and throw in some heavy thrash (Metallica, Pantera) here and there mixed with some cooperate rock (Styx,Journey) and you have the feel of the album. There's a lot of instrumentals and ballads. But I understand stand it's suppose to tell this story. I guess the metal head in me wants to hear John Petrucci crushing metal riffs and blazing solos. Don't get me wrong there's some on here and they are amazing. But I understand as a artist you want keep doing things different and refreshing and that's what they were doing on this album. It continues to grow on me and it is actually getting addicting to listen too. Differently check this album out if your a dream theater fan. I'll check back and a couple of years after it has a lot of time to grow on me.","classification":4}

{"text":"After forty years, the Gibb Brothers have finally re-released their most classic and eclectic of albums, \"Odessa\".  Released at the height of their first popularity and the start of their ultimate eighteen-month breakup, these three musicians, barely out of their teens, produced their only double studio album.  Originally coated in a red velvet cover, this is one of the most extravagant re-releases to date.  Originally seventeen songs, varying from the near operatic, \"Odessa (City On The Black Sea)\" to country flavored tunes like, \"Marley Purt Drive\" and \"Give Your Best\", the Gibbs cover nearly every style of pop music available, including rock, orchestral, country and R&B.\n\nOriginally slated to be titled, \"An American Opera\" or \"Masterpeace\", this double album epitomizes the height of talent of the Bee Gees boundless creativity.  In addition to two new studio songs, \"Pity\" and \"Nobody's Someone\", there are alternate and demo mixes that will surprise in their originality, beat and alternate verses.  \"Edison\", \"Lamplight\", First Of May\" and \"Whisper, Whisper\" all are given special treatment, sometimes twice.  \"Whisper, Whisper\" is actually Part Two, a welcome addition to a song that originally ended too quickly on a fast, rock driven pace.\n\nOf the three discs (57 songs), the stereo had been remixed\/remastered to absolute, crystal clear perfection, bringing out all the muffled sounds that the original LP contained.  The Mono mixes present the songs with emphasis on different vocals and instruments, while the third disc contains all the previously unreleased material.\n\nFan Joe Brennan of website \"Gibb Songs\" has this great explanation of Stereo vs. Mono recordings:  \"Odessa was recorded on 1-inch 8-track tape reels.  Each of the 8 tracks can be played separately, and each might have the input from one or more microphones.  Each of the 8 could be recorded at different times and places (like New York and London), or erased and re-recorded.  To make stereo, you have to mix down to 2 tracks, and for mono, mix down to 1 track.  While doing this you get to decide how relatively loud each track should be.  That's where the differences come from.  The source is the same 8 track master.  Mono was for old record players, and for AM radio, which was where you heard the latest tunes on your transistor radio or car radio\".\n\nWith three discs, a poster, extensive liner notes, photographs of the group, handwritten lyrics, single covers and reel-to-reel listings, a T-Shirt and a sticker all enclosed in a nifty red velvet covered box, this limited edition is a fan and collector's dream.","classification":5}

{"text":"Question?... (ok, not so much of a review, I know, I know. But I am curious about this.)\n\nThe description of James Friskin's recording of the Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue is interesting:\n\n\"Transcription in the Light of Harpsichord Technique\"...\n\nThat's not the name Busoni gave to his transcription of Bach's Chromatic Fantasy (if it is Bach's, and not misattributed, the way some other items in this... ok, _there's_ a tangent for another time :) :) ) - that's the name Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji gave to his transcription of the Chromatic Fantasy, followed by a transcription by Sorabji of a \"Bach\" fugue, BWV 948 I think (which it seems is indeed the work that follows it here??) of even less known authenticity.  Still, Friskin isn't known (well, not listed on Worldcat, not listed at that wonderful site Bach-cantatas.com, etc.) to have recorded the Sorabji transcription (they only list one commercial recording, by Habermann; if you look under Friskin, their list of Bach-and-related recordings by him doesn't include that transcription, in turn, etc.) -- meanwhile, I don't know the Sorabji version so wouldn't be able to tell it from the Busoni or other transcriptions\/arrangements the Chromatic Fantasia has received.  Anyone know or have a fairly good idea what's going on here?\n\nI am a little concerned that I downloaded a Bach Cantatas set here from the same source that cost at least as much as this and seems to have been entirely duplicated by this Bigger Bach Set (if I'd noticed, I would have downloaded this, with all the music in that more(?) expensive mp3 set, all the music (same performances) in it and much more besides) but that's on me for not being careful, that'll happen. Sort of as if I were to have downloaded 15 tracks for 99c apiece before noticing I could have downloaded all 300-odd for $3.00, a mistake I fortunately did not make... quite a few good sets here from these (and the VoxBox collection), and if I have to make some tweaks to the descriptions and accept uneven performances, that unfortunately has been true for -much- more expensive music purchases too, quite a few of them, back when I was in a position to make them. Anyway. Help identifying the Bach arrangement appreciated, of course.)\n\nThanks.\n\nEdit 12-23-13: ah, ok, sorry- problem solved. Ok, based on the sample page of the Sorabji arrangement\/transcription here---\n\n[...] ---\n\nFriskin is -not- performing Sorabji's transcription (note the lack of sustained chords in right hand, at the beginning, and left hand, a little while in. Hrm. Anyway. :) Now I wonder if it's the Busoni, or his own transcription\/arrangement, or...)\n\nAdditionally, the next track is mislabeled- it's not BWV 948 at all (which contributed to my confusion) but rather the fugue that usually follows the Chromatic Fantasia (whether or not actually by Bach - whose authenticity is not quite certain, but then, neither is that of Bach's perhaps most famous work which is not, however, in this set (the Toccata and Fugue in D minor).)\n\nIn connection with which and about this set- not a complaint, unavoidable given its provenance, though I wish the tracking had been updated given more modern information- is that BWV 53 is not (probably not!) by Bach, but by the earlier composer Georg Melchior Hoffmann (died 1715), perhaps copied for a performance by Bach around 1730; similarly one of the flute sonatas here is based on a violin sonata in G minor now regarded as probably by Bach's son Carl P.E. (catalogued as H.542.5, I think.) Probably other examples. But I still would and do recommend this set (and I've noticed of course that our response to finding out that the \"Jena\" symphony is not by Beethoven or that BWV 53 is not by Bach has generally been (fortunately with some exceptions, lately) to drop both from performances rather than, say, take any active interest in other works by the composers who were able to compose something good enough to fool a generation into thinking they'd written something by Beethoven or Bach (or in Hoffmann's case, composed something Bach wished to revive, which was the reason for the confusion)...","classification":4}

When Ray Parker Jr. came out with the original Ghostbusters theme song, it was caught under innuendo and storms, with him using the Huey Lewis & The News song, I Wanna New Drug back in the 80's. But with time and space, the song has still been as iconic today, as it became a hit back then. When I had heard Fall Out Boy do a cover of this definitive song, Ray Parker Jr. & Huey Lewis got credit for in the 80's, and the original version isn't bad after all this time. It is definitely one of those movie songs that has still stood the test of time, in the way other movies songs like Purple Rain did for with the late great Prince and Footloose for Kenny Loggins as well. It surprisingly still shows a lot of longevity that is worth listening to, and much more worth the download for new fans of the upcoming Ghostbusters remake, and die hard fans of the classic films with Bill Murray & Dan Akroyd.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4}

{"text":"New Orleans emcee Curren$y is one rapper that will never be accused of selling out. Despite his breakthrough in 2009, Curren$y actually has been around for about a decade. He was originally signed to No Limit Records and a few years later to Cash Money Records- but struggled with creative differences between both labels. In 2009, he decided to go the independent route with his albums \"This Ain't No Mixtape\" and \"Jet Files\". The following year, he became linked with an unlikely ally- former Roc-A-Fella co-founder Damon Dash, who brought him to his new label DD172. It was there he released his most critically acclaimed projects to date: \"Pilot Talk\" and its follow-up \"Pilot Talk II\". He also appeared on \"Pilot Talk\" producer Ski Beatz' \"24 Hour Karate School\". In 2011, he inked a major label deal with Warner Bros. Records and released the free album \"Covert Coup\", which was produced by The Alchemist. Later on in the year, he released his second Warner Bros. album, the Monsta Beatz produced \"Weekend At Burnie's\". While Curren$y has made a commitment to staying underground, his next project would be an exploration into commerical stardom.\n\nIn June 2012, he released his new album \"The Stoned Immaculate\". His newest recording boasts some rather big names on the production as well as collaboration front. He gets help from producers such as J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League (Young Jeezy, Rick Ross, Mary J. Blige), Bink (Jay-Z, Lost Boyz, Blackstreet), The Neptunes and Tha Dogg Pound member Daz Dillinger. While this album is a clear attempt at being radio friendly, not much has really changed in style and sound for Curren$y. Look no further than his duet with Wale on \"What It Look Like\" as well as the synth heavy \"Privacy Glass\". He gets appearances from singer Marsha Ambrosius on \"Take You There\", 2 Chainz on \"Capitol\" and Pharrell Williams on \"Chasin' Papers\". He also reunites with Wiz Khalifa on \"No Squares\" as well as on the Big K.R.I.T. produced \"My Life\". He brings in proteges Trademark Da Skydiver and Young Roddy for the chorus on \"Armoire\" and newcomer Corner Boy P on \"Sunroof\". While he does the usual on here, he does step out of character on a few songs where he talks about relationships. He reminisces over an old flame on \"Chandelier\" and duets with British singer Estelle on \"That's The Thing\", where he struggles to keep a relationship together. Overall, Curren$y's \"The Stoned Immaculate\" is a pretty good album, despite the blatant move for a mainstream audience. While it does look a little sketchy on paper, his new album is worth checking out.","classification":5}
{"text":"I got this song after listening to the preview for 5 seconds. This is an awesome artist and this song is great. Very nice and mellow, a good use of a continuous riff in the background reminiscent of classic rock ballads with a beat that is more folky and new age. I'm really diggin' this.

{"text":"For this soundtrack, don't think 80s, One More Time, or a new soundtrack masterpiece to cap off an already amazing year. No, think Inception-Lite, then add in some electronic beats. By Inception-Lite, I mean the music between soundtracks is kind of interchangeable, but there's clearly a more quality winner here. In fact, much of the soundtrack barrows from the Hans Zimmer school of thinking, not just the certain horn structure that was so infamously from Inception (The Game has Changed), but the strings, how the strings are arranged, the moods given off, etc. Granted, I know the soundtrack was composed before Inception ever came out, but the whole thing sounds very Zimmer-Esque.\n\nWhy is this? Well, the soundtrack may be \"by\" Daft Punk, but Joseph Trapanese did much of the orchestrations, with only the guidance of Daft Punk. Daft themselves did the electronic work. As a result, the work sounds very much like a modern soundtrack. But since Zimmer holds the example of the modern soundtrack currently in my mind, it sounds very derivitive of that for me. Not that this is a bad thing per say, but the entire score does hold an ever-present feeling of familiarity. It's mixed up by the electronic elements of course, which sound something straight out of a future nightclub, complete with weird DJ stuff, drumbeats and other tricks of the Daft Punk trade. Still, it doesn't sound amazing enough to stand on its own.\n\nAnother thing I must bring about is the theme. You know, the one introduced in the first track as a grandiose piece, comes back for a couple tracks at the beginning, then starting back with \"Arrival,\" dominates the rest of the proceedings. It's a rather simple horn piece, and it's used to great effect, but if feels like it also uses it as a crutch much too often. Introduction moment. Bring in the theme. Action moment. Bring in the theme. Emotional moment. Bring in the theme. Triumphant moment. Bring in the theme. End credits. Bring in the theme, remixed by Daft Punk. You see my point? It's a great and memorable theme, but it's a bit too simple to be as used as often as it is.\n\nOverall, Tron Legacy the soundtrack is not bad. It's a solid effort, but suffers from the stark feeling of familiarity wherever you go. Did it really take them two years to compose this? Still it's a must-have for soundtrack fans, and if it draws in non-soundtrack fans, then I'm fine with that too.\n\nOne thing I'll say though, if the soundtrack's job was to make you want to see the movie, then they certainly accomplished that.\n\n3.5\/5 Stars","classification":4}

That song belongs to Diana Ross and Lionel Richie so why tamper with a classic?\"\n\n To me the original version is still by far the best, but I have to give kudos to Shania Twain for giving one of her best vocal performances in her entire career. As anyone knows who has ever sung \"Endless Love\" it is one of the hardest tracks to nail as most of the song is sung on a high pitch, but Shania delivers and more. This was no small feat for her as she had not sung in several years and was having voice problems up until the day of the recording.\n\n Sadly the song bombed on country radio, but many have said (myself included) that it is one of the best singles on Richie's album \"Tuskegee\".","classification":5}

{"text":"The 90s backlash has been ugly, with this not only 90s classic, but music classic being pushed aside since radio chewed it up and spit it back out, 1,000 spins later. It still lives on in the minds of millions of fans who still put this high up on their life's soundtrack.\n\nIt's a song that runs on a million trains of thoughts, ranging from karma, to self-appreciation, to celebrity-bashing. It's certainly ground-breakingly awesome, bringing awesomeness to another level not only in the world of pop rock, but music period. Hearkening back to those piano-driven pop ballads of the 70s, this outwardly simple song holds a lot of complexity to it. Just ask U2 guitarist\/song-writer \"The Edge.\" When asked in Time Magazine back in '06 what songs he would most like to have written, there was \"Wonderwall,\" and \"You Get What You Give.\" And even though some would say it's a throwback to years gone by, it keeps itself a modern eye, staying relevant not only in the 90s, but also in the 00s.\n\nThen you gotta love those vocals, using the false, and they're just so perfect for the song. And again, it's a throwback to the 70s. As for the last few verses, although some outlets have cut them, I don't really care about them, and they kind box the song in the 90s a little bit too much. Although the way he sings it is great, it's kind of here nor there, didn't need that.\n\nSo looking at best 90s songs, this ranks in the top 10, which is pretty impressive considering the litnia of the decade. Once the brutal 90s backlash is over this song and ones like it will once again receive the credit they deserve, but until then, \"You Get What You Give\" will play on as the soundtrack for a moment in time, forever frozen in splendor.","classification":5}

The song suggests one look at why they are doing what they are doing, and reminds us that in the end, we will have to \"deal with the devil\".

Or, if you've never bought a Tchaikovsky CD or MP3, then this is the collection for you - at $1.99 you can hardly go wrong.  You can't beat the price with a stick and you get hours and hours of quality music by one of  the greatest Russian composers of all time.  There's The Nutcracker Suite of course, and then there's Swan Lake, The 1812 Overture, The Romeo and Juliet Overture, Symphonies 1-6, amongst others.  This is some of the best and well known classical music outside of some pieces by Bach, and Beethoven's 5th.  The 1812 has been in so many movies, and every xmas they play Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy, or some such.  The same is true for R&J, and Swan Lake.  You couldn't get out of the way if you tried.  Don't get me wrong, this music is timeless and gorgeous.  It doesn't get better than this!  Tchaikovsky was clearly an inspired Russian genius, and it shows on the tracks on this MP3 download.  Use it for relaxing, meditation, reading, or as the background for your life.  It's simply hours and hours of beautiful music!\n\nFOR THE MUSIC PURISTS:  Use this to fill holes in your collection - it's so cheap, it's almost like stealing.  There's so much here that you can't go wrong, even if some aren't perfectly executed.\n\nFOR EVERYONE ELSE: Use this to build your collection.  There are at least 8 other MP3 downloads like this one which would start the basis for a lovely classical music library. If you get to the point where a piece doesn't sound right, or bothers you in any way, go out and explore alternatives.  There are tons out there.  What I like, you may not, and vice versa.  For example, the only people I like play Rachmaninoff are Rachmaninoff and Mischa Dikter.  Yet, I'm told a lot of people play him well - I just don't agree.  It's all personal taste.  Take recommendations, but figure out what you like yourself.\n\n At $1.99 each, that makes it under $18.00 to have 1800 tracks of 9 classical masters, ranging from Bach to Debussy.  You can't even buy a family of 4 fastfood for that little.  Or you could buy 18 tracks on i-tunes, not 1800.  I can tell you, I did it, and it's been the soundtrack to the greater part of my life since I did so.  It especially makes wonderful background music while reading anything from fiction to nonfiction - and of course making dinner.  You can't beat this deal - just buy this!  Buy all of them!

{"text":"It's been 3 years since the super-group of four of the best emcee's out there in the 2000's got together and put out there near-classic debut group album, and about a year and a half since they followed that up with a short teaser, 6 song solid EP.  Once again they come together and give you some real hip-hop with real lyrical content to listen to.  Though not as good as their debut group album it is still solid and 4, maybe 4.5 star material.  I have over 30 albums between the four members that they are part of: 13 with Royce, 12 with Budden, 6 with Crooked, and 5 with Ortiz, and many of them are classics or near classic albums, not one is at all anywhere close to being bad or even average.  Though a lot of people didn't hear of most of these rappers in the mainstream and recognize their potential until after they were out for some years, they all have been around for  quite some time.  First hearing Crooked I back in '98, Royce in '99, Joell in '01 and Budden back in '02, it unfortunately took some time for them to get on the radar, but it is well deserved as they are some of the best out now, and honestly, some of the best out ever.  Super talented on the mic and all have ridiculous flow, and they continue to shine and showcase that talent on here. Guests get alittle heavy, on 13 of the 18 songs, though mostly just doing the chorus, on 10 of them and only guest rappers on 3 songs. With 18 songs, you get 2 near classics, 3 that are ok\/average, and the remaining 13 are good or real good songs.  Of the 18, Joe Budden is on 16, and the other 3 are on 17 songs.  Production is handled mostly by Eminem co-producing with a lot of others (14 of the 18 songs). Alex da Kid does 2, Kane Beats and Justice League each do 1.  The other 14 Em co-produces:  2 are with: T-Minus, Kon Artis, Streetrunner, Boi 1da, and then 1 each with: Hit Boy, Araab Muzik, No ID, Black Key Prod., Luis Resto, Kane Beats.  Again a great album to have from some great lyricists who remind us of the good old days of rap.\n\n#2 - (f\/ Eminem & Skylar Grey - no Joe Budden)\n#3 - 8 (f\/ Busta Rhymes)\n#4 - 7 (f\/ Eminem)\n#5 - 9.5 (tight beat)\n#6 - 8.5 (nice beat - f\/ Selena Jordan)\n#7 - 8 (deeper thought provoking song f\/ Cee-Lo)\n#9 - 8 (has some annoying repeats and be much better without them)\n#10 - 8.5 (f\/ Swizz Beats --- nice beat)\n#11 - 8.5 (deeper song f\/ Skylar Grey)\n#12 - 8.5 (has Ortiz & Budden going hard back and forth much like Jadakiss & Styles often do)\n#13 - 9.5 (deeper song - no Royce da 5'9)\n#14 - 7.5\n#15 - 9 (nice beat --- f\/ Sly Jordan --- No Joell Ortiz)\n#16 - 8\n#17 - 8 (f\/ Eminem - no Joe Budden)\n#18 - 6.5 (f\/ Melanie Rutherford --- worst one on here, could have left this one off)\n#19 - 9 (f\/ Songvibe --- deeper song with nice beat --- no Crooked I)\n#20 - 8.5 (f\/ Poo Bear & B.O.B.)\n\nCROOKED I --- Dominick Wickliffe --- b. 9\/23\/78 --- Long Beach, CA\nROYCE DA 5'9\" --- Ryan Montgomery --- b. 7\/5\/77 --- Detroit, MI\nJOELL ORTIZ --- b. 7\/6\/80 --- Brooklyn, NY\nJOE BUDDEN --- b. 8\/31\/80 --- Jersey City, NJ\n\nCheck all my reviews","classification":4}

{"text":"I'd heard some good and great reviews of Toad's new release and I'm agreeing.  This is more than a solid from the Wet Sprocket boys.  It comes across as mature and self-assured.  They are not just making music but are crafting songs, moments of music and lyric that conveys a message and a mood.  Musically there's nothing too deep or adventurous here, but it is melodically solid and enjoyable.  Even the slower moments serve the sake of the song's mood and they seem to have tracked the album to break up the slower numbers (like \"Golden Age\") with peppier numbers (like the following \"Get What You Want\").  I hear a bit of a Joe Henry vibe on songs like \"The Moment\" and \"Golden Age\".  \"California Wasted\" has an almost alt-country Wallflowers flavor and opener \"New Constellation\" drops us into a lighthearted up tempo moment but, for my money, album closer \"Enough\" (about end of life decisions from someone dying from cancer I think) is the strongest overall track; smartly produced, a sad song that counterpoints the opener in its pathos, and yet completely sympathetic and conveying a feeling of strength it ends on an oddly triumphant note.  Now I mark this as pure emotion and am not necessarily agreeing (or disagreeing) with statements of belief that underpin this (or any of their) song(s) but I can tell you I really appreciate the thoughtful lyrics and that the songs are about different content and not just love pop fluff.  4.5 stars.\n\nGood stuff.","classification":4}

{"text":"OK - so I impulsively bought this album as a result of it being rated as the No. 1 album of 2015 by the magazine Q - A magazine I have relied on in the past for their balanced reviewing.\nAll I can say is this is a big disappointment. I listen to music to emotionally engage with and I find this to be soulless and dull. The reliance on boring drum machine programs (mixed way too far forward on some tracks) and dull unimaginative bass lines make for a very plodding, leaden feel. I am all for modern artists to explore retro styles, but in this case but it all sounds pretty bland and derivative.\nThe synth melodies are OK in places, and there are a couple of tracks that are a pleasant listen, but overall there is nothing that makes me want to play this again, let alone agree it is album of the year. However, I will give it another go, as maybe I am missing something. After all, Q can't be wrong!","classification":3}

{"text":"This cd is an awesome example of how disco was not a truly terrible music period and that when fused with other styles it could produce pure magic.  Many will look at the set list here ands see two things - the hit single WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN and the huge TSOP by MFSB which featured The Three Degrees.  But what we really have here is the debut US album by the queens of Philly soul who managed to merge heavenly soul and r@b with disco to produce harmonies and tracks that were mesmerizing.  The opening DIRTY OL MAN is stupendous and was a huge dance hit.  Other gems here are CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ME, A WOMAN NEEDS A GOOD MAN and the totally overlooked masterpiece IF AND WHEN that should have been another huge hit.  Their harmonies blend perfectly on every track but here they manage to even add a touch of rock to their style.  Of course due to the time period we do have one very dated track and it is the silly I LIKE BEING A WOMAN.  But it is such fun to hear it and see how it fit in during that time in music's history.\n\nThis cd is digitally remastered for superb sound quality and has great bonus tracks and liner notes.  There are certain albums that show a time period in all it's glory.  Here we have a uniquely talented female group with exsquisite harmonies.  They represented Philly soul at its finest and this cd is a must for any music historian or fan of the genre.  When music is good it is good and these ladies are great and this set provides a superb listening experience.","classification":5}

{"text":"About three weeks ago I got out of the hospital where I suffered, in a little way, for five days battling the mind, longing for God's love, and what I considered to be demonic taunts, as well.  It was confusing, intense, and soul deep in stress and need for mercy and love.  I had heard Lauren's song \"How Can It Be\" on the Christian rock radio station K-LOVE.  I was hearing voices that told me whether I go to church and receive communion or do not, whether I pray kneeling or outside was all \"scrupulous.\"  I also heard I needed to repent for my sins and others I love may not go to heaven.  It was strange, scary, and a call to sanity and prayer.\n\nI pulled into Walmart to buy dental floss or something small like that.  I parked the car.  This song came on . . . \"I am guilty . . . \" the song begins.  Immediately, she was singing for me.  I was singing along with her.  I began to cry, to blubber, to choke up, streams of tears.  It was intense, sorrowful, and even joyful.  Cries of joy, the Psalms and scripture also tell us.  \"You plead my cause . . . \" Lauren sang and I thought of all my sins, my failures, my shortcomings because maliciously prosecuted by Satan.  Then I thought of Jesus' love and mercy, I thought of another name for the Holy Spirit, the Advocate.  God is the best prosecutor, defender, lawyer, and judge.  I melted in mercy and tenderness.\n\nJust three days ago I decided to buy that song online because of how much it means to me now.  Triumphant, rejoicing, a witness to the faith.  Mysterious, merciful, amazing grace of our Lord, Jesus Christ, of God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit for his children, to save us from sin and the evil one.  I went to Our Lady of the Nativity to pray before going to a coffeehouse to buy that song online.  As I returned to my car after prayer with that song on my mind, when I started my car that song so happened to come on my radio!  Blessed be God!  How can it be?  How amazing indeed!  God is good.  God is love.  God loves us and calls us to repentance and holiness.  Amen.","classification":5}

{"text":"I first heard of Buck Owens thru the Beatles' Act Naturally version back in 1965 or so. As time went on I began to appreciate Buck's remarkable band and talent. His records sounded so clean and featured twangy Fender guitars. His band leader, Don Rich was a model of restrained professionalism. Clean and accurate picking, not fast or flashy. Buck was an outstanding singer and his two part harmonies were his trademark. All these songs were No. 1s on the country charts and date from Act Naturally in 1963 to 1988's Streets of Bakersfield with Dwight Yoakum featuring Flaco Jiminez on accordian. WOW! What a great CD this is. There isn't a bad cut on it! If you only want one Buck Owens CD, this is the one! It's too bad most younger people only remember him as a cornfield clown on Hee-Haw, because Buck Owens was truly one of the greatest country stars in its history.","classification":5}

{"text":"Moth Vellum are a relatively new progressive rock band out of California who became a more well known name after being booked for the 2008 version of the Rights Of Spring Festival.  The obvious influence with Moth Vellum would be Yes, especially their 70's classic period.  Guitarist Johannes Luley sounds so much like Steve Howe in spots on this disc that you could almost swear it was Howe doing the playing.  The vocals are high pitched and though not exactly like Jon Anderson there certainly are similarities.  For a debut album this is very very good.  The compositions range in length from just over 5 minutes to the 13 minute epic \"Salvo\".  The music here is top notch progressive rock of the highest caliber.  The vocals are unique and varied.  The lyrics get slightly clichd here and there, but overall they are very good as well.  I enjoy every track on the disc and think that Moth Vellum are one of the best new bands to come out of the U.S. in several years.  If you are a fan of classic progressive rock, especially Yes, you should love this album.","classification":4}

John has had live albums before.  I don't own either the 1988 \"John Prine Live\" or the 1997 \"Live On Tour\" albums.  I don't know if he is always this conversational when performing live.  I, for one, am grateful.  I find it fascinating to listen to the thought-process of a song-writer and discover the simple everyday events that are sometimes the foundation of really great songs.\n\nJohn's music is a mix of folk and country, with wide ranging flashes of many genres including bluegrass, blues and rock.  This live performance leans strongly in the country direction both in terms of performance and song selection.  His voice sounds great, especially considering he's not more than a few years removed from radiation therapy and recovery.\n\nTHE MISSING SONGS\n\nJohn Prine has written a boat-load of songs.  It's interesting that he chose not to include some of his better known songs here.  Namely \"Hello In There,\" which was covered by both Bette Midler and Joan Baez, and \"Far From Me,\" which Prine has called his favorite of all his songs.

Most surprising perhaps is the omission of \"Sam Stone,\" the famous tale of a Vietnam veteran that was his breakout song.  Perhaps the reason for the omission is the generally upbeat nature of this show, but I for one wish we could have had all those songs included here.\n\nTHE INCLUDED SONGS & THE STORIES\n\nHe starts the album off with \"Spanish Pipedream,\" a kind of funny story-teller's song, before going into the mildly sappy, \"She is my Everything,\" which he describes writing for his wife.  His personality comes through as upbeat and content.\n\nOn \"In Spite of Everything\" he tells the story of writing the song for the movie he was in with his good friend Billy Bob Thornton.  He is joined by Iris Dement, who for some reason is un-credited in the performer listing within the MP3.  In fact, none of the guest singers are listed within the MP3 tags.  \"The Late John Garfield Blues\" also includes female vocals which could be from Iris but John doesn't say.\n\nHe reflects about his family on \"The Bottomless Lake\" and even talks about song-writing in the middle of performing the song.  He talks about learning guitar from his brother Dave on the start of \"Bear Creek Blues,\" one of the few tracks here that isn't a John Prine original.  \"Saddle In the Rain\" has a moody rock feel that marries perfectly to the pointed lyrics.\n\nAngel from Montgomery is one of the two better known songs in this performance that come from his first album. This is another duet, this time with Emmylou Harris, and it sounds great here.\n\nJohn uses the story behind \"Your Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven Anymore\" to tell a story about his time as a mailman, as well as take a jab at G.W. Bush.\n\n\"Mexican Home\" is a beautiful ballad with great layered guitars and lovely harmonies.  \"Unwed Fathers\" is also in that vein, though it has a male-female harmony duet.\n\n\"Glory of Love,\" written with Roger Cook, takes a more upbeat turn.  And he closes the show with the mid-tempo country ballad \"Paradise,\" which was covered by the Everly Brothers and also comes from his first album.\n\nJust another warning about the MP3 quality: this is variable bit rate and the majority of the tracks here are not 320kbps.  Some are as low as 182kbps.  The recording sounds good but those who desire higher bit-rate recordings will want to wait to get the actual CD.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis is a beautiful live recording with all the intimacy that one might experience at a live concert itself.  I only wish there were more songs included here, but perhaps they were saving them for a bonus edition.  I also wish they would have listed the contributing artists in the MP3 tags.  I still recommend you give it a listen.\n\nEnjoy.","classification":4}
{"text":"After Chrisette Michele's debut album her second album Epiphany left a lot to be desired.  It wasn't exactly a knockout punch and was more like a sophomore slump.  Others liked it but I felt it was lackluster and pedestrian.  I left that album completely disappointed especially since her debut, in my opinion, was a classic.  When I found out Chrisette would be releasing a new album I kinda felt indifferent about it.  On one hand she was featured on my favorite song of the year Rick Ross' Aston Martin Music in which she absolutely brought her A game and on the other hand I was still disappointed about Epiphany.  I found out she would be releasing a mixtape to whet the appetites and to serve as a prelude to the new album.  I downloaded the Love Thy Brother mixtape and largely thought it was wack.\n\nSo I came into the album with rather low expectations and after listening to the album I'm still not happy about the output.  Let Freedom Reign is not cohesive and features songs that are clearly out of place.  There's a few songs where she channels her former self such as If Nobody Sang Along, I Don't Know Why But I Do, and I Sang Along but those moments of goodness are few and far between.  So In Love ft. Rick Ross is an above average song as well.  Both of the singles are weak; Goodbye Game & I'm A Star.  They lack personality and are pretty much standard fare and with a talent like Chrisette we need more than the standard.\n\nIt pains me to say this but again Chrisette Michele has failed to deliver the goods.  For me, that's two albums in a row and that's unacceptable.  I cannot recommend this album especially on a release date that's crowded with better efforts from Jazmine Sullivan, Ron Isley, El DeBarge, Miguel, Eric Benet and Slim Thug.  In other words, you can pass on this one unless you are a die hard Chrisette Michele fan. 2.5 Stars.\nA","classification":2}

{"text":"To me DMSR is the crown jewel of 1999. Even though all the songs are great, DMSR is the epitome of the Prince sound at the time an gave us a glimpse to where the sound was going, it greatly benefits from the assists from the Revolution, due to him splitting the hook an lets the girls singing the backgrounds the funk becomes soo inclusive an he was aware of that, \"all the negros sang... all the white people on the floor sang\" just totally brilliant. Production wise Prince took drum programming to whole nother level while the old cats where struggling to make a drum machine sound an feel like a live drummer, Prince seen the future of funk, that kick snare pattern just loops for 8 minutes, with various breakdowns from the electric toms lol, but all the other instruments get to play freely an make it feel like what it is a funk jam where all the little nuances go a long way the Sly scream that during 80's was part of his trademark hits, the rappin \"I don't wanna be a poet...\" The wicked bass line the master overdubbing makes you feel like it was recorded live at first avenue in Minneapolis, you can taste the sweat off the party goers just funky. All studio. Very few artist could replicate this level of funk in a studio. I mean sure George an Parliament had 8, 9 minutes jams but they also had an army of nearly 12 to 20 people to do it. This was created I'm sure with 5 people or less. Awesome.","classification":5}

{"text":"Robyn is definitely one artist from the 1990s who stands out in my mind. I liked every song she released to radio during the 90s and that is why I gave \"Body Talk\" a chance. I dived into this album head first without reading any reviews or finding out any information on this album. Had I known this LP was a dance\/techno\/electronic album, I would still have listened, but I would have prepared myself since I am no fan of this genre of music.\n\nI am a lover of ballads, especially when sung by artists with voices who can carry out notes in an effective way like I know Robyn can. I was disappointed as I listened to \"Body Talk\" because I patiently waited for a ballad that never played because there are none here. Period. Instead what we have is 15 songs full of uptempo techno music. This album is an acquired taste by all means. It is geared toward those who enjoy techno music; that is what this album is filled with. Robyn still sounds great as ever, though. \"Dancehall Queen\" is an okay song. There is a Caribbean influence which is a nice touch. \"Dancing on My Own\" is a song about Robyn seeing her ex with another girl on the dance floor. It's one of the album's finer moments for sure. Snoop Dogg is featured on \"U Should Know Better.\" It was good that a rapper was added to this album for it is the only guest appearance, but he does not do a good job. The whole song is one of the album's biggest missteps. For starters, the F word is said one too many times. Additionally, the song is dumb and totally forgettable.\n\nOverall, I am not impressed. Even if I were a fan of techno music I could not see myself falling in love with this LP.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"In My Eyes\"\n2. \"Dancing On My Own\"\n3. \"Dancehall Queen\"\n4. \"Time Machine\"\n5. \"Love Kills\"","classification":3}

{"text":"Have been listening to Drake (almost) from the beginning, but I have to say that Views' incredibly positive reception on here puzzles me. This isn't a bad album  (Well, except for Keep the Family Close and Pop Style) just one that's so......predictable. Views feels like it's going for the atmosphere and vibe of the much better and more original Take Care, but comes across as an imitation with the energy sapped right out of it. On the comparatively  few instances where Drake raps, he sounds almost disinterested, and his rhymes are some of his least inspired yet. Moments where the rap elements of Views truly come alive (like the great Weston Road Flows) are incredibly few and far in between.\n\nThe singing on the other hand feels like the same old thing. There's the same 80s-sounding pop track, there's the duet with Rihanna, there's the weird sort of dance track featuring Partynextdoor, there's the slow jam near the end of the album......it all seems to be mining familiar territory. And though Fire and Desire's one of Drake's best slow jams and of course it's impossible to deny the catchiness of Controlla and One Dance or the slick production throughout, many of the singing tracks similarly feel sunk by a disinterested-sounding MC and the feeling that we've been here before but better.\n\nDrake's longtime producer 40 (who comes back to the forefront after taking slightly smaller roles on Nothing Was the Same and If You're Reading This It's Too Late) does what he does best, providing a truly ambient and dreamy backdrop that has become Drake's sound. I wish the hip hop-focused If You're Reading This sounded at least close to this good, and while his work keeps Views going, it never really takes off because Drake just never really seems to be trying to do anything other than what's expected of him.\n\nStill, if you're a fan of Drake you should find at least a decent amount to like here; it does have its moments and an oftentimes top notch production. I thought it was solid for a couple of listens, but there hasn't been much for me to come back to. Many aspects seem to be firing on all cylinders, but Drake's uninspired performance and a general lack of anything new makes Views his most forgettable LP yet.","classification":3}

{"text":"\"A Single Man\" by Elton John is a hard one to evaluate. On the one hand, the songs are mostly good ones; and the production is super sweet! Very soft and understated. But Elton's vocals are mostly dis-engaged and generally charmless.\n\n\"Return to Paradise\" might just be; what with those beautiful falsetto vocals, \"Georgia\" might  be an under-rated one of those Southern Anthems that filled up \"Tumbleweed Connection\". But, for me, the real nuggets are the final three songs \"Madness\", \"Reverie\" and \"Song for Guy\", which all sit well together, kind of a trio of darkness, really; \"Madness\" is a spine chilling disco-prog-rocker with lots of haunting piano chords; \"Reverie\" is brief but effective, and \"Song for Guy\" is suitably melancholy and ethereal, given it's essentially a requiem. The vocal part is particularly evocative.\n\nThe other songs aren't bad. \"I don't care\" is a fun rocker in the style of his earlier ones, but the vocals don't relay the fun. \"Part-time love\" is the best of the rest, a pumpy little tune with a big production. Not a bad album, Rating **1\/4 or 2.25","classification":2}

{"text":"Tori never really went anywhere...but at points over the last decade I feel she lost her way slightly by trying to hard to create musical concept records.  Don't get me wrong...I loved American Doll Posse but felt that Abnormally Attracted to Sin and the Beekeeper to be substandard works.  I love Tori and have seen her multiple times but when I heard the Night of Hunters CD I was really beginning to wonder if Tori lost her Spark.  I purchased this CD the day it came out and listened to the entire record twice now and all I can say is TORI IS BACK...the music is simple and the lyrics excellent.  Each song fits well on the album and has a nice melody...something that was lacking in some of her more recent studio works.  If you like Tori you will really enjoy this CD.","classification":5}
{"text":"What I enjoyed about Arcade Fire's first two albums (and much of the indie rock genre in general) is their emphasis on quality over quantity. When I first heard Funeral, it floored me. Neon Bible disappointed me at first but it grew on me and now I really enjoy it. The Suburbs has the same diversity, mood changes, and smart lyrics as its predecessors but it drags a bit and would have been just as good as their first two albums if a few songs were left off. As for the highlights, there are many. The opening title track brings things off to a rollicking start while \"Ready to Start\" is a strong rocker with a great lyric and the keyboards adding a lot of color during the chorus. \"Modern Man\" has an oft-kilter rhythm that works well while the excellent \"Suburban War\" has a great hook in its guitar line which stays present throughout as the song changes in both tempo and drama. \"City with No Children\" is both serious and catchy while \"Month of May\" is frantic, kinetic, and catchy all at once.  Other strong tracks include the dramatic \"Deep Blue\" and the danceable \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\". The rest of the tracks are good but \"We Used to Wait\", \"Sprawl I (Flatland)\" and both of the \"Half Light\" tracks drag the album's momentum down. All told, this is still a fine release and many of the songs here are worth owning.","classification":4}

{"text":"Big & Rich have proven themselves to be more than just some novelty act: a former Lonestar frontman combined with a failed solo singer.  However, how MUCH more than a novelty act remains to be seen.  Some of their songs have genuine staying power: \"Holy Water,\" \"8th of November,\" \"Lost in This Moment,\" and (whether we like it or not) \"Save a Horse Ride a Cowboy.\"  Other tunes collected here are enjoyable, if not truly great: \"Wild West Show,\" \"Kick My A**,\" and \"Between Raising Hell and Amazing Grace\" especially.\n\nIt's odd that they've released a GREATEST HITS almost completely full of album tracks.  Some (\"Loud\" and \"Jalepeno\" specifically\") could've been replaced with far better selections (\"I Pray for You\" \"Real World,\" and \"Deadwood Mountain\" come immediately to mind); others, such as \"Rollin' (The Ballad of Big & Rich)\" are perfect examples of why the boys have made such an impact: their ability to shirk the rules, to create country music that bends (and even redefines) genres.  Their debut album remains unashamedly one of my favorites; the follow-ups have decreased in quality, resulting in a GREATEST HITS that offers nothing new of note, and features some (let's face it) lackluster material.  Still, Big & Rich have some great songs, and most of them are compiled here; \"Holy Water\" and \"Lost in This Moment\" are alone worth the price of admission.  This album is definitely hit and miss; but when Big & Rich hit, it's like nothing you've ever heard.","classification":3}

Jose's intimate reworking of that tune climbed all the way to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100.  The song won Jose Feliciano a Grammy for Best Pop Male Vocal of 1968.

If so, I don't think Lopez has much to sweat if there's more than one song even close to this one.\n\nThe opening to this is just a marvelous barrage of powered up synths that leads to a rapid fire beat, followed by Jennifer's party-ready (albeit unremarkable) vocals. She really just exists in this song to deliver the lyrics, which she does well. What really makes this song so good is the meaty backbone of a beat. I'm unsure why Jennifer's handlers would choose 'I'm Into You' over this as the next single, but this should definitely be the choice for third single. This is likely what 'On the Floor' could have sounded like given a bit more time and no Pitbull.\n\n'Love?' may not be a solid choice for an album, but it seems to have a few gems buried on it. This is the pinnacle of such, worthy of download and ready for a party.","classification":4}

{"text":"Australian alternative musician Nick Cave (Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds) release 2013's Push The Sky Away independently via Bad Seeds Ltd. Mysterious, eccentric, and brilliant are all appropriate adjectives for the alt-rock\/alt-singer\/songwriter affair. Different from anything else released in 2013, the nine-track Push The Sky Away shines brightly, benefiting from its individualism.\n\nOpener \"We No Who U R\" sets the tone, exhibiting a soulful undertone, derived from its groove and the arrangement of strings, horns, and warm backing vocals.  \"We No Who U R\" also showcases the first instances of minimalism, something that is used throughout the effort.  For all its superb idiosyncrasies and eccentricities, the opener brings it all together on the memorable refrain: \"And we breathe it in \/ there is no need to forgive...\" \"Wide Lovely Eyes\" keeps things interesting, governed by a driving groove led by guitar as opposed to drums. Like the opener, Nick Cave's lead vocals possess a nice presence about them. On the chorus section, background vocals provide more body to the overall sound.\n\nOn standout \"Water's Edge\", Cave quasi-sings\/quasi-speaks, truly delivering a 'narrative'.  The tale he conveys is one about young love that is quite descriptive and somewhat risqu&eacute;; he doesn't goes 'too far', but definitely grabs one's attention and raises an eyebrow (or two). The chorus appears at the end, featuring three iterations: Its the will of  love \/ Its the thrill of love \/ Ah, but the chill of love is coming on. \"Jubilee Street\" follows sensationally, bearing a sound pop-rock\/soul percussive groove, intact with hi-hat and tambourine. The highlight comes toward the end, where intensity grows marked by instrumental crescendo.\n\n\"Mermaids\" continues on a suggestive lyrical path, much like the previous \"Water's Edge\".  Cave asserts memorably that \"I believe in God \/ I believe in mermaids too...\" on the second verse.  On another highlight, \"We Real Cool\", lyrics are definitely a strong suit.  On the chorus, Cave sings \"Who was it, yeah you know we real cool \/ on the far side of the morning, who was it.... and I hope you're listening too.\"  More clever, however, is his pop cultural reference to Wikipedia: \"Sirius is 8.6 light years away \/ Arcturas is 37 \/ the past is the past and it's here to stay \/ Wikipedia's heaven...\" \"We Real Cool\" is a cut laden with tension that leaves you on the edge of your seat just waiting to see what direction it will go in next.\n\n\"Finishing Jubilee Street\" follows up the earlier cut, distinguished by a groove with hip-hop sensibility about it. Cave even goes as far to say \"I'd just finished writing 'Jubilee Street'\", returning musical sensibilities back to the heyday of singer\/songwriting (60's and 70's).  Repetition remains Cave's best friend, particularly on the chorus: See that girl \/ comin on down\/ comin on down \/ comin on down.  \"Higgs Boson Blues\" delivers an epic eight minute cut, continuing to share clever lyricism and great diction and annunciations vocally from Cave.  The title track, \"Push The Sky Away\" ends the album strongly, making good use of pacing, space, and minimalism.\n\nOverall, Push The Sky Away is one of the year's more memorable releases.  It keeps the singer\/songwriter style alive and well. There are no misses amongst the nine cuts; each possesses something noteworthy and special.  Highly recommended by all means.","classification":4}

She has focused too much on the dance pop music, that she hasn't really stretched her voice, and it has made her incredibly weak. Her latest song Dance Again isn't actually anything that really feels invigorating from Jennifer Lopez. Her new collaboration with Pitbull just doesn't show they have the chemistry to click, like they did with On The Floor. I think Jennifer should take a break from singing for a long while, and just focus on American Idol as a judge. Perhaps, it is time for her to hang up her pipes for awhile, and find a better rhythm for her voice.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2}

{"text":"Is there a more romantic death song than Don't Fear the Reaper? Buck Dharma sings it like a lullaby, calm and easy. Death is a natural occurrence, and belief in an afterlife can make a person less afraid of it. They may even run to it.\n\nClassic guitar riff, anyone who plays rock guitar has probably practiced it at some point in their lives. And of course there is the COWBELL! That SNL sketch was so brilliant, Christopher Walken 'THE Bruce Dickinson.' Yeah, the cowbell is fairly non-stop but it's low in the mix and often falls into a sonic blind spot so it tunes in and out of my consciousness. I think I almost typed couscousness there, ha ha that's what I was thinking...weird.\n\nThe guitar solo is pretty classic as well. Sometimes I wish they hadn't let the last note sustain so far into the verse, but not a deal breaker, Blue yster Cult. What a great name for a band. When I was younger, I thought they were scary, based on the cover of the 45 I had of Burnin for You. Ha ha, these guys are goofy. Where does one find blue oysters anyhow? Or is it a blue cult that worships oysters? Or does an umlaut over the 'o' mean something entirely different? Talk amongst yourselves.","classification":5}

{"text":"I've listened to all three tracks in their entirety.  They are worse than disappointing.\n\nThese are entirely instrumental versions, no vocals.  But the only \"instrument\" seems to be a synthesizer, using various [artificial] sounds that sometimes sound like some sort of flute\/whistle, and sometimes very slightly like a harp.  Everything is buried in a very deep layer of electronic reverb, entirely unnatural.  Even that is badly done:  in each given medley, when one song ends, the reverb fades out abruptly, instead of dying out \"naturally,\" before the next song starts.  Finally, the \"performance\" -- if you can call it that -- is very mechanical, with little or no expression.  There's no variation in tempo or in volume.  Me-cha-ni-cal.  Ro-bo-tic.\n\nI have no idea why this is called \"Celtic.\"  It's just cheap synthesizer music, period.  I guess this might be acceptable in an elevator, where you listen for less than a minute before getting out.  But I certainly wouldn't want to sit down and listen to this stuff intentionally.  At least it's not punk or rap.  So in the spirit of Christmas I'll give it two stars instead of one.\n\nIf you are expecting real music (played by humans on real instruments), or something that is really Celtic, then skip this collection.  Doesn't Amazon preview this stuff before they unleash it on the public?","classification":2}

{"text":"One of Van Morrison's finest live albums (or one his finest albums period), \"It's Too Late to Stop Now\" has been amended with this set which features three (nearly) complete concerts (I don't think there's much in the way of music missing just between song patter, etc.) on CD as well as a DVD of one of his 1973 Rainbow concerts.\n\nThe original \"Now\" was a two LP affair (the last reissue did include \"Brown Eyed Girl\" from this collection but the rest is previously unreleased) and the CD, likewise, was two CD's as well. This set make have some duplicate songs but it has NO duplicate performances for the shows included on CD.\n\nLet's start with the mastering--Vic Anesini (Sony\/BMG's in-house mastering engineer and one of the best out there IMHO) does a great job of mastering this release. It's dynamic, has nice depth and detail without losing dynamics. These are all remixed from the original 16 track multi-tracks.\n\nThe performances are stellar--drawn from three venues between May, June and July 1973 at the Troubadour, Santa Monica Civic and London's Rainbow Theatre. These are unadorned performances---there are no overdubs and no duplicate performances (although there are duplicate songs but the set lists vary). James Brown may have been the hardest working man in showbiz but Van and his band from this time were a close second.\n\nPlease note: it appears that there is one duplicate song from the previous set but is remixed--\"Into The Mystic\".The performance sounds VERY similar.\n\nThe DVD features a terrific show from the Rainbow Theatre as well (keep in mind that Van did multiple performances at each venue during this tour). My only complaint is I wish that we would have had 1) more than one choice when it comes to format 2) I would have loved the CD available as 5.1 mixes (but then they do want us to buy more product, right?). Blu-ray could have held ALL of the concerts in lossless 5.1 mixes as well as the live footage.\n\nThe packaging is nice but could have been a bit better--the CD's and the DVD come in a digipak with each disc in a plastic tray. The booklet only includes some photos, a brief comment on the shows and credits. It would have been nice to have some context for the concerts with a great booklet. Yes, I know some people could careless but there are those who do. The music, though, is the ultimate goal and from that perspective, this is a big winner.\n\nA classic album gets four siblings expanding on a classic live album.\n\nHighly recommended.","classification":5}

It has been for her work with American Idol, and for her marriage to Marc Anthony ending in a sour split. But for her latest single, she wants to try and recapture whom she was a singer before, and fails to do it on Papi, the third single from her album Love? The song isn't really as driven as some of her other dance songs from before in her career. In fact, hearing it now, feels like a weak kitten than a striking and strong tiger. Good luck to Jennifer on her other projects, but Love? wasn't really feeling the love at all, with the exception of On The Floor.\n\nSong: D","classification":2}

{"text":"Today would have been Whitney Houston's 52nd birthday. She sadly passed away 3 1\/2 years ago, but the heart and soul of her beautiful and enchanting voice had never lost its luster, while she did lose her own soul in singing, largely from every lampooning her and abusing her to death, as the \"Crack Is Whack\" joke, and not looking at whom she had been as a delightful human being. Now, with thinking of Whitney Houston's passing, and the recent passing of her one and only baby Bobbi Kristina Brown, I am constantly reminded of the deep sadness, and sincerity she left behind in each and every note she sung from her beloved heart. I Look To You remains a dominant example, hearing the song for the first time as we were all dealing with the death of Michael Jackson in 2009, and at the same day of his funeral, I really was so reminded of when a voice and song can deeply hit you, and this song really hit the nail on the head. R. Kelly really wrote a masterpiece for Whitney Houston, and if you had never heard a song she had recorded, than you must download this song.\n\nWhitney Houston: 1963-2012\n\nSong: A+","classification":5}

This album has so much more emotion though and to me is so much more powerful too. I also like that they actually have some of their own songs on this album. It is hard to pick a favorite because they are all so good. There wasn't one song that i wanted to skip. I thoroughly enjoyed every one of them. The only disappointing part was when the last song ended. I didn't want the album to end. Oh well, I guess all good things must come to an end.

Act tough, look tough, become the biggest hype, rap idiotically cause its something that they'll play at the clubs or raves because everybody will like it cause they are tripped out on PCP or something, and then they'll start using 50 Cent as a code word for drugs, because in time that's all anybody will remember him or at least the slogan for.  No body will care about the \"music\", only about this cool little code word that will pop up in time.  I may be wrong, but don't be surprised if it comes true.....or maybe its already in affect right now.... *gasps*\n\nYou got to hand it to 2 Quarter, his wildest dreams came true.  He got rich at the expense of the masses.  His reign of annoyance is almost at its end as apparently, his new CD flat out sucks even more.  Well, now its time of his career to die.  Don't be surprised if he puts out a CD titled \"Stay Rich or Die Tryin'\", when he runs out of ideas to avoid doing commercials with M.C. Hammer by his side.\n\nP.S.

{"text":"This is one Return to Forever album that somehow passed me by and I am not quite sure how (or why) because it is phenomenally good and ranks right up there as one of my favorite RTF albums.  The style of music on Where Have I Known You Before (1974) is somewhat similar to Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy (1973) although there is a bit more in the way of softer textures, making for a very balanced listening experience.\n\nThe lineup at this point included Chick Corea (Fender Rhodes electric piano, acoustic piano, clavinet, Yamaha organ, ARP Odyssey synthesizer, and percussion); bassist extraordinaire Stanley Clarke (Alembic electric bass guitar, Yamaha organ, bell tree, chimes; excellent drummer Lenny White (drums, percussion); and newcomer Al Di Meola (electric and acoustic guitars; acoustic 12 string guitar).  I think it goes without saying that this is a musician's band.  These guys are all unbelievably talented, with Stanley Clarke setting new standards for performance on the bass that would be equaled by few - this guy is mind-blowingly fast.  For his first time playing with RTF (Al was 19 at the time), Al does an incredible job, although his playing is not as dominant in the mix as it would become on later albums.  With this album, Chick had started weaving synthesizers into the RTF sound and he gets some great tone colors out of the ARP Odyssey on this album, which is plastered everywhere.  As a huge fan of progressive rock and electronica, I do not mind the analog synthesizer use at all, although some jazz fans might be turned off.\n\nThe eight tracks on the album range in length from 1'02\" to the 14'21\" Song to the Pharoah Kings suite.  In terms of the music, it is an incredible amalgamation of jazz; jazz rock; progressive rock; space rock; funk and even a tiny bit of classical - more like a proggy jazz rock actually.  In fact, as a progger, I really appreciate the dense arrangements and virtuosity.  Speaking of which, just about every odd time signature under the sun is used on Where Have I Known You Before and there is some incredibly complex ensemble work.\n\nSandwiched in-between the highly electric rave-ups are three of Chick's acoustic piano improvisations including Where Have I Loved You Before; Where Have I Danced With You Before; and Where Have I Known You Before.  This is the closest this album comes to sounding like traditional jazz and showcases Chick's considerable talents on the acoustic piano.  The softer acoustic tracks provide a nice contrast with the highly charged electric tracks.  Earth Juice is the \"funkiest\" piece on the album, although this funk is pretty far removed from Sly and the Family Stone.  Of course, Chick's work on the clavinet here and there on the album really lends to the funkiness.  The suite that closes the album out is a high point for me and opens with a great synthesizer arrangement, which then launches into some extremely complicated ensemble work that sounds very similar to some of the music that was coming out of the English progressive rock scene at the time.  Although there are solos on this lengthy track, they are really very interesting and are seamlessly integrated with the arrangement - in fact, they sound pre-composed.\n\nAlthough it may not appear to be the case, this Verve release was remastered (albeit a low budget remaster), and the sound quality is very good.  There are a few photos of the band and a lengthy bit of \"cosmic\" verse from Neville Potter.  The imagery of the words is both colorful and evocative.\n\nAll in all this is an excellent RTF album (my \"new\" personal favorite) and is very highly recommended along with Romantic Warrior (1976).  Proggers should definitely check this album out.","classification":5}

This one is one of her more serious songs, she has a wide range of style some more Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, and Some like Time After Time. This is a great song starting with a great pop beat, then the powerful lyrics. This song is about life, how sometimes we can lose ourselves, and how we need each other when things get rough.","classification":5}

{"text":"I think, like many, I was first exposed to Chris Isaak in 1989, with the video for \"Don't Make Me Dream About You\" on VH1, from \"Heart Shaped World\". I remember not thinking much at the time. After all, it sounded country to my 16 year old ears, and I didn't\/don't really like country music. But, in early 1991, with the help of David Lynch's 1990 film, \"Wild At Heart\" starring Laura Dern, Nicolas Cage and Willem Dafoe, the song \"Wicked Game\" somehow made its way into popular culture, and then, of course, you have Chris Isaak's video for the song, too.\n\nAfter that, I picked up a copy of \"Heart Shaped World\" and still didn't think much of it. There were some good songs, but the overall feel of the album was rather boring. File that thought away. Still, I bought 1993's \"San Francisco Days\", 1995's \"Forever Blue\", 1996's \"Baja Sessions\", 1998's \"Speak Of The Devil\" and 2002's \"Always Got Tonight\" and the rest. I even went back and bought \"Silvertone\" and \"Chris Isaak\". I've never seen him live, but I don't know, there's something I've always liked about Chris Isaak's music and sense of humor. Now, in 2015, I can't think of anyone else who's making his type of music (1950's, really). Generally, only a handful of other musicians come to mind such as Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Brian Setzer, Johnny Cash, Dave Edmunds, Nick Lowe, etc.\n\nSo, it's been about four years since his cover album, 2011's \"Beyond The Sun\" and six years since his last original work, 2009's \"Mr. Lucky\". \"First Comes The Night\" is okay. It's not Isaak's best work, but not his worst, either. It's about average. Not as good as \"Mr. Lucky\" was.\n\nThere are some good songs here like \"First Comes The Night\", \"Please Don't Call\", \"Down In Flames\", \"Reverie\", \"Baby What You Want Me To Do\", \"Running Down The Road\" and \"Insects\". The rest of the tracks are okay. I even got the deluxe version (which, by the way, thanks for offering on Amazon, and not selling exclusivity to Target). The five additional tracks are just okay. I don't think they improve upon the first 12 tracks much. In fact, I think \"First Comes The Night\" would benefit from editing. I think if you kept it to these ten tracks things would improve: \"First Comes The Night\", \"Please Don't Call\", \"Down In Flames\", \"Reverie\", \"Baby What You Want From Me\", \"Don't Break My Heart\", \"Running Down The Road\", \"Insects\", \"The Way Things Really Are\" and \"Some Days Are Harder Than The Rest\".\n\nAnyway, it's nice to have another Isaak album, but I'd like to see him experiment more. He's got nothing to lose after 30 years of making albums. I still think \"Forever Blue\" and \"San Francisco Days\" are his best works.\n\nHere's how \"First Comes The Night\" compares to Isaak's other works:\n\n1985 Silvertone: Four Stars\n1987 Chris Isaak: Four Stars\n1989 Heart Shaped World: Four Stars\n1993 San Francisco Days: Four and a Half Stars\n1995 Forever Blue: Five Stars\n1996 Baja Sessions: Three Stars\n1998 Speak of the Devil: Three Stars\n2002 Always Got Tonight: Three Stars\n2009 Mr. Lucky: Four Stars\n2015 First Comes The Night: Three Stars","classification":3}

{"text":"Whenever I need a Strauss fix, this is the first disc I turn to and it never fails to revive my drooping spirit. Recorded in late 1998, it brings together three absolutely beautiful but still very distinctive female voices, all of whom have timbres tailor-made to their roles: Fleming smoky and luscious with oboe-toned lower notes suggestive of the Marschallin's experience and maturity, Graham more open, impassioned and boyish as befits the breeches part of Octavian and Bonney silvery and soaring in girlish ecstasy to incarnate the feisty Sophie. Then we have the gorgeous playing of the VPO, elegant and responsive under Eschenbach's loving but flexible direction with plenty of - but not too many - drawn-out moments when we can linger over the multi-layered harmonies of this wondrous music. The suggestion of tears in Fleming's voice when she ponders the passing of time or the inevitability of Octavian leaving her one day is deeply moving without descending into mawkishness. The famous Trio is a slice of heaven: three impeccable sopranos soaring, entwining and over-lapping in a typically Straussian splurge of emotional outpouring.\n\nI remember Rene Fleming talking about feeling inspired on hearing Helen Donath (I think it was) singing the final scene from \"Capriccio\" when she was a student in Germany on a Fulbright Scholarship and promising herself that one day she would try to sing it as well as Donath - and her performance here is truly one to remember her by as she deploys all that is best and most attractive in her lyric soprano. She is careful to make her German sound idiomatic and expressive and depicts all the quirky humour, wry resignation and heartfelt confusion experienced by the Countess - and the introductory \"Moonlight Music\" is a master class in swooning orchestral indulgence; the horns are from another world.\n\nThe duet from \"Arabella\" allows us to hear more of Barbara's Bonney exquisitely pure, bell-like soprano; again the voices spiral heavenwards in \"Aber der Richtiger\" - surely one of the most memorable extended melodies Strauss ever wrote - like the two larks in Strauss's \"Im Abendrot\" from \"Four Last Songs\". Again and again the attentive listener will forget to breathe so absorbing is this miraculous singing.\n\nIt is of course delightful to hear the veteran, now late, bass-baritone Walter Berry in the cameo roles of Faninal and the Major Domo.\n\nAs you might by now have gathered, I rather like this disc. I wrote this review after a friend remarked that he was surprised that I hadn't registered my attachment to it on Amazon: job done.","classification":5}

This si a totally different Jewel.  Although many are critisizing her I love it.  Not a lot of anyhting in here.  There songs are more movable which is good.  Do people really want Jewel to keep making boring music and people to pretty much get sick of her.  As for all the critics... well this album debuted at #2 on Billboards album charts and is the highest position she has ever been.  Therefor she must be doing something good.  I honestly say that I love every song on this album and I never thought I would say that about Jewel.  Also her sound is very \"Shakira\"  this time around which  is interesting in a way.  She is going more rock\/dance and every artist changes their style with every album but her words and meaning in songs stay the say.  I congratualte Jewel on an album VERY well done.","classification":5}

{"text":"I've been a fan of Vivian Green since before her solo career began - I took note of her vocal skills when she (along with the equally talented Carol Riddick) performed back up vocals for Jill Scott.  Vivian is a truly talented yet vastly underrated artist and I wish she had as loyal a fan base as Jill Scott's or a wider outlet for her music.  Vivian is a consistent artist who hasn't hopped on trends nor veered too far away from the music she presented on her 1st album, yet those who loved that album haven't really taken the musical journey with her as she's evolved.\n\nI've had this album since it was released but haven't listened to it in one sitting until now - I've gotten into a somewhat bad habit of buying albums and putting them straight on my mp3 player but not giving them a proper listen.  However over the past week, I heard one too many songs from this album that brought smiles to my face on my subway ride home which prompted me to listen to the entire album and share my thoughts on it.\n\nThis is a well put together album: lyrically & production wise that kept my interest from the 1st song to the last - it's great to buy an album that has 12 great songs instead of a bloated 22-track album with only 4 or 5 good songs, so kudos to Vivian & her production team!\n\nMy favorite tracks:\n\nX - after an awkward rap intro by Freeway, it gets better\n\nFREE AS A BIRD - love the lyrics\n\nANYTHING OUT THERE - melodic, mid-tempo track\n\nWHEN CAN I SEE YOU AGAIN - sultry delivery\n\nSTILL HERE\n\nSUPPOSED TO BE MINE - plaintive song about a lost love on which I felt her emotion","classification":5}

{"text":"I am going on my 5th listen of this track and must say that Bruno Mars is a class act. I've always actually liked him (since B.O.B.'s \"Nothin' On You\") but man is he consistent!

I think that's a strength! Why can't they just appreciate that it was eclectic and great? I mean all of the songs worked and had that Bruno flair. \"Locked Out Of Heaven\" could have fit on the album nicely. Like I said it kinda has a pop feel with occasional dance touches but it definitely has classic rock attributes too in the simple guitar work. I really do care a lot about this track and think it's pretty damn good. I truly look forward to his second effort as it will probably be his first work that I get. I plan to get his debut too because that was just quality music. Shine on, Bruno!\n\n4.4 stars.","classification":4}

{"text":"\"What would you think, if I sang out of tune, Would you stand up and walk out on me?\"\n\nFamous words sang in a famous song, sung by a famous drummer. No Ringo, wed never walk out on you. Never. Not even if theres a fire. But the same can no longer be said of the Flaming Lips and their extremely old and stale shenanigans. I think Im honestly one of the remaining few that have held on up to this point. I championed The Terror, that Peace Sword S\/T, and that 7 Skies H3 album they released last RSD(I honestly thing 7 Skies H3 is some of the best stuff theyve done since Embryonic.) Man, Ive taken every bitter pill theyve sent my way and Ive loved every weird trip theyve taken me on. But this cover album of Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band? Nah, I just cant do it anymore. Im through. There needs to be some sort of intervention for Mr. Coyne. Shut down his Instagram. Take away his gummy molding machine, and all of his plastic doo dads he covers himself in on stage. He needs to seriously get his head out of whatever fumes hes been inhaling and breathe in some untainted oxygen. The jig is up, you fearless freak.\n\nLet me first say that Im not some Beatles extremist. When I first heard the Lips were covering Sgt Pepper I was thrilled. I was and still am a huge fan of their take on The Dark Side of the Moon. I felt that in their own way The Flaming Lips stayed true to that album without compromising any of their weirdness. If they were to do that with Sgt Pepper, then we were going to be in for a real treat. I mean, Sgt Pepper was a massive statement. A milestone, and an album that in many eyes can never be replicated or matched. The Lips created that for me in 1999 when they put out The Soft Bulletin. That album was pure, child-like honesty put to otherworldly and ethereal music. It encapsulated the wonder and fear of life and death, all brought together by Wayne Coynes wavering and breaking voice. I was 24 years old when that album came out and it affected me much like Sgt Pepper affected so many folks 32 years before. How could Wayne Coyne and company screw this up? I don't know, but they did.\n\nThis album really comes off as a big, noisy mess. Its as if Coyne and company weren't even there. They let special guests(and there were quite a few) in the studio, locked them in, and proceeded to pump in nitrous oxide through the vents to see what would happen. Its a real shame, too, as underneath it all theres some great performances by The Autumn Defense, Dr. Dog, Phantogram, and My Morning Jacket. Those performances are covered in clumps of audio fuzz, grime, and over blown excess. Yes, Im aware Im talking about the Flaming Lips when Im complaining about excess. Heres the thing: the Lips have always excelled at excess. They do excess beautifully. But here the excess is excessive. A beautiful vocal performance by the Autumn Defense in With A Little Help From My Friends is completely stunted by pairing them with Black Pus. Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band is shat upon by a overzealous guitar solo by the wonderful J Mascis at the end. Getting Better, featuring Dr. Dog, seems like a completely incredible combination until you throw Chuck Inglish in there as well and it just kinda falls flat on its face. I wouldve loved to have heard Dr. Dogs full access on this track, with the Lips noodling on the knobs and faders a bit. Instead we get this detached Chuck Inglish vocal over top Dr. Dog with some pretty great stereo drums. Its so close to perfection. A Day In The Life, while not bad, seems to just fall a little flat. This shouldve been monstrous, explosive, and beautiful. Instead, we get the most restraint weve seen on this covers album where it shouldve been the biggest statement possible.\n\nA lot of people have bitched and moaned about Miley Cyrus connection to the Lips and Coyne, and especially her inclusion on this album. Well Im here to say she is not to blame for the issues here. She does fine, really. She is featured on A Day In The Life, as well as one of the album highlights, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds. They go big for Lucy and it works beautifully. Electric Wurms cover of Fixing A Hole is also a nice surprise. They pretty much stick to script here, with some nice, dreamy effects. Sorta like Yes covering the Beatles and it works. Shes Leaving Home is quite melancholy with Phantogram, Julianna Barwick, and Spaceface. It has an 80s electro vibe with all of the original tracks mournful feel. Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite! with Maynard James Keenan is a perfect fit, actually. It has a carnival of souls aura and Keenan makes the track his own. Within You Without You with Birdflower and Morgan Delt keeps the mystical vibe of Harrisons original, with some modern touches that aren't too overbearing. Most of the rest? Kinda just there, really.\n\nThe strangest thing is that you wouldnt even know this was a project curated by The Flaming Lips if it weren't for the production. You hear them in like two tracks. Other than that, who knows? Even with something like Heady Fwends you got the feeling Wayne, Steve, and Michael were in the room with their fwends. Not so much here.\n\nI look at classic albums like Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, Pet Sounds, and Odyssey and Oracle and I compare them to classical pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, and Debussy. They fall under the canon of timeless pieces of music and should be interpreted and endeared by future musicians and artists. Weve done this for hundreds of years and it is a practice that should continue for hundreds of years to come. The Flaming Lips, I felt, were a band to do such a thing with The Beatles. They did right by Pink Floyd. Theyll do right by The Beatles, right? Even for Coyne, Drozd, and Ivins this is pretty far out there. Theyve taken themselves and a bunch of great artists and covered their covers of Lennon\/McCartney compositions in so much noise its hard to discern anyones original intent.\n\nThis certainly isn't a phoned-in tribute. Its ambitious, ballsy, and grand for sure. But even Pollack knew when enough was enough. Wayne, sometimes less is more. I still love you, but Im gonna have to walk away on this one.","classification":3}

{"text":"In 2000, I was in high school and at a friend's house, when he played \"Change (In The House of Flies)\" on his stereo. From the first few seconds, I was hooked and knew I found a band I would fall in love with. I have listened to the Deftones regularly since then, 16 years ago. I have every album of theirs on CD. I had big expectations for this album, \"Gore,\" since it has been about four years since the last Deftones record.\n\nFirst, let me say that \"Gore\" is by no means a terrible album. It has its moments, particularly with songs like \"Phantom Bride\" and \"Hearts\/Wires\" which I feel are worthy additions to the Deftones canon. But on the whole, the album doesn't hit as hard or as beautifully as their previous efforts. The atmosphere it creates is good, but some of these songs just don't hit the mark, like \"Xenon,\" which doesn't feel like it belongs on a Deftones album, but as a B side.\n\nAlso, I have to agree with other reviewers that the album doesn't give enough room to Stephen Carpenter. I can understand why in interviews, Carpenter has said he wasn't totally on board with recording these songs. He doesn't feel like a major part of the album, except for a few tracks, like \"Gore.\"\n\nI am happy I listened to the album, and I'm writing this review after listening to the album in its entirety, on two separate occasions, on different days, to make sure I was totally confident with what I was about to write. I can't help but feel somewhat disappointed with this record, especially considering how long it took the Deftones to release it since Koi No Yokan. Here's to hoping the next album is better.","classification":3}

{"text":"\"Rockaholic\" is the brand new seventh studio album by American glam metal band \"Warrant\". Five years past their previous album \"Born Again\", the established line up of Joey Allen (g), Jerry Dixon (b), Eric Turner (g) and Steven Sweet (d) introduce new front man Robert Mason. This line up has been performing live since 2008 at which point most fans were anticipating a new studio album.\n\n\"Rockaholic\" is a return to the established \"Warrant\" sound; catchy grooves, thick guitars, large and often naughty, choruses all of which create an undeniable party atmosphere. The blues\/rock'n roll influence is traceable on the majority of the songs still the band extend their musical style writing rock ballads such as \"Home\" and \"Cocaine freight train\" as well as AOR tunes like \"What love can do\" and \"Tears in the city\". At this point one has to comment that Mason holds nothing back on this album and sure enough he delivers song after song.\n\nWith 14 tracks on offer, \"Rockaholic\" is amongst the lengthiest albums in the band's catalogue as well as being a high quality hard rock release; one could theorise that the previous years of live performances and testing the line up on the road has possibly affected the end result being pretty diverse yet totally \"Warrant\".

{"text":"An Evening With The Allman Brothers Band 2nd Set (1995) was recorded in 1994 at shows in Raleigh, NC and New Jersey's Garden State Arts Center. This was during the Back Where It All Begins period, and there are four songs from that album included here.\n\nThe opening song, Sailin' Cross The Devil's Sea sounds great, a lot like the studio version, and features Gregg Allman's legendary blues growl. Gregg and Warren Haynes both shine on this inspired version of Warren's Soulshine. Dickey Betts' Latin-flavored and breezy Back Where It All Begins features a long guitar jam, where he and Warren trade interesting and enthusiastic solos. They also do a great job on No One To Run With.\n\nThey dip into the At Fillmore East catalog with a very good version of You Don't Love Me, and while not as ambitious as the 20+ minute Fillmore East version, it is very good, and Dickey even flashes back to the earlier version by quoting his guitar solo from it. It's really an amusing and touching moment, and it sounds good, too. They also do a nice cover of another old blues song, The Same Thing.\n\nThis recording of Jessica won the Allmans their first and only Grammy Award, and what a wonderful version of Jessica this is! With dual guitar harmonies and more bongo drums and percussion than the studio version, the song sounds almost completely different from the original, and stretches out over sixteen minutes.\n\nEven with all this, the real highlight on the album is the breathtaking unplugged version of In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed. WOW!!!!!!!!!!!! The newbies who think Dickey Betts is no more than a mediocre guitarist should listen to this, and then reconsider. Warren Haynes stays right up there with him. The two guitarist show what they can really do on acoustic guitars, and bassist Allen Woody shines, too. This is priceless, a real gem that no ABB fan would want to miss.\n\nLike the First Set, the 2nd Set was produced by music legend (and At Fillmore East producer), Tom Dowd, and the sound is exquisitely crisp and crystal clear. The clever packaging on both sets is almost identical, with the same cover photo, except the First Set is blue, the 2nd Set is red, and the photos inside and liner notes are different (the layout is the same).\n\nThis was a good place in time for The Allman Brothers Band and their fans, and it really shows on An Evening With The Allman Brothers Band, First Set and 2nd Set.

Gloria, Midnight hour, old Stones favorites -- these were the elements of our playlists.  The three-chord simplicity of these old tunes seemed a refreshing reshaping of the blues that gave birth to them. It's been great listening to this and the others I purchased along with it. The only thing remarkable about this group and those like it is that the guys only had one hit in them.","classification":5}

As with her last album, the cohesion of this record as an overall piece as opposed to a few disjointed singles interspersed between filler is admirable and effective at pulling the listener in.

Kirk Whalum does what he does very well, but that does not mean that his interpretation would be on point because too often an artist fails at presenting or even preserving the original feel of music not their own. Kirk Whalum, however, knocked this one WAAAAYY out of the park! But it would be absolutely wrong to act as if he pulled this off alone, for he did not. Wendy Moten, amazingly, raised All I Do to a place that undoubtedly rivals Stevie's own. This is smooth, SO SMOOTH, jazz at its best. ~K.I.S.S~","classification":5}

God Rest Ye Marry Gentlemen is also a favorite of mine. Chicago has taken their trademark horn riffs and harmonies and have put out one heck of a rockin' holiday album. There are slow tempo songs too that sound just as great. This is a CD to get if you want a rockin' Christmas.","classification":4}

{"text":"From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.  Nothing at all to sink your teeth into.  Was this a contractual obligation album?  Resting on their laurels?  It will sell because of who we are!  Guys, please don't end your musical career as a band with this one!!","classification":2}

{"text":"Ordinarily I don't write a review for items with over say, 5 reviews.  But, not surprisingly, this record gets love it or hate it reviews.  All hardcore punk rock enthusiasts love it (how can you not?) and all heaven's to Murgatroid alt post punk lovin' musical sweethearts (we could use other terms but maybe you get the idea?  Sure we do) hate it because it is so intense and unrelenting.\n\n1) There's less time between songs on this baby than possibly any other record.  Cool man.\n\n2) Actually, it's very fast rock.  That may not be obvious.  If you slowed this stuff down it'd just be a rock 'n roll album.  But the breakneck pace launches it into the world of hardcore punk rock.  Virtually by the speed of the music alone.  Let's just say that 24 or so years after its release it still deserves its title of a speed record.  Sure, there's probably some bands that have performed faster (NEIGHBORS of San Diego did a 22 song set in about 24 minutes about 4 years ago and I thought the singer would have an anurism - that his blood vessels would explode - while he was singing and the other 4 band members were each going at maximum possible speed every single song.  By the time the set was over everyone in the place was fully satisfied.  I still regret not video taping that gig.  Unbelievable).  But for the year this came out it was stupendously stunning then and I'll still put it on once a year or so and revel in its full out blasting of some high quality music.\n\n3) Sure, it's not the highest quality recording quality.  Although it's actually higher than a bunch of punk rock that was released back in the day - late 70's, early 80's.  Mainly cuz so much of it was Do It Yourself.  Think about it, SST is a giant indie punk rock label.  They remained, all these years, and certainly then, a label for and by punx with a very eclectic range.  Ok, so most of their records blew.  But this is a classic that will stand the test of time.  Of course, so will SST's BLACK FLAG Damaged and earlier records and their MINUTEMEN records.  Virtually everything else they released is suspect (see HUSKER DU's post Everything Falls Apart records as a for instance, yuk).\n\nWhen big business is not involved,\n\nA) the artist makes what they want, with no filtering by big business producers trying to make the music more appealing to the masses ie. watering it down, popifying it\n\nB) there is less money to work with so live recordings like this one don't always get recorded with expensive equipment so the recording quality is less than what we're used to hearing from big name artists and\n\nC) there's fewer copies of DIY records because only a thousand or 10,000 are made rather than 500,000 copies.  As it is, this recording quality is quite nice compared to a number of other DIY punk live releases.  Quite listenable I'd say and I don't care to hear poorly recorded live recordings.\n\nThank you SST and HUSKER DU for making something that still today brings a mighty smile to my face and 1000's of other hardcore fans today and into the future.  The rest of you who can't take this sort of thing, don't.  Go buy a nice GUIDED BY VOICES album.  The existance of this album doesn't diminish what HUSKER DU did later.  It just shows us they sailed a different ship and left us this, their one pure classic.  DRI and DIE KREUZEN, each with an amazing first 7\" of defining, everlasting pure hardcore and then both bands just flaked off into, well, they left and made music that is still an embarrasement to listen to, at least to a punk.  chrisbct@hotmail.com","classification":5}

{"text":"This album is somewhat of a return to form for Bryan Adams, who up to this point had only released one album during the past decade, the lackluster \"11\" back in 2008. Two things prevent the album from being a full-fledged comeback: the fact that the album is only 9 songs and about 25 minutes long, and another reason being that it lacks two key elements from his past multi-platinum albums, that being a hard-edged melodic rocker (\"Thunderbolt\" tries hard but doesn't cut it), and a big power ballad, his trademark. None of the songs here come close to matching those heights. The album does have some good melodies. \"Brand New Day\" is a fantastic power pop song; \"That's Rock & Roll\" falls somewhere between a \"Reckless\" B-side and Tom Petty's newer material. \"You Belong to Me\" hints that Adams has the potential to grow old gracefully, from a musical standpoint.\n\nSo, overall, this is a successful comeback, simply because a few songs stand out as possibly significant hit singles on the Hot AC format. Adams hasn't had any chart success recently, so anything resembling even a shadow of his former self would be welcome by longtime fans. Overall, \"Get Up\" has the skeletal framework of a successful album, but there's just not quite enough meat (or muscle) on it's bones to truly bring it across the goal line.","classification":4}

I became a big fan the very first time I heard her breakout hit \"Downtown\" in late 1964. Over the next several years Petula Clark would brighten America's airwaves with sensational singles like \"I Know A Place\", \"Don't Sleep In The Subway\", \"I Couldn't Live Without Your Love\" and \"My Love\" to name but a few. In March 1967 Warner Brothers released Petula Clark's stunning interpretation of \"This Is My Song\", a tune written by silver screen legend Charlie Chaplin.

{"text":"Words like bellissimo and mangia don't quite capture the pure affection that is Il Volvo. If you are sick of other amateur p\/o\/s\/e\/rs like Il Divo and those other clowns, forget about them and just insert your Il Volvo cassette player into your Sony Walkman and let the proverbial good times roll. The majesty of Il Volvo is extremely hard to put into mere words, but suffice it to say that just one listen to any Il Volvo song on this CD will cause you to become pure love itself, magnified by a million-fold and multiplied by the power of infinity...and then some.\n\nWhatever you wanna call it--amore, amour or just effing--it is present in copious amounts on this Il Volvo offering. This CD will literally burst into flames from the extreme passion and red-hot love that the adolescent teen boys of Il Volvo--peach fuzz and all--are exuding. I thought that Jesus Christ was love itself, but after listening to Il Volvo's young, stud-like men, I may have to reconsider. The feeling you get when holding this CD in your mere, mortal hands is unbelievable: Your heart flutters, you feel light-headed, and you even feel a little sick, almost like you're going to throw up! In short, you feel all the symptoms of falling in love, falling in love with Il Volvo, that is. In fact, while I am typing this, I am getting a lot of hot flashes from the pure amore that is Mario, Luigi and Santorini. Oh, boys...ooo, la, la.\n\nEach and every song on this CD is a total winner; I know that all CDs are marketed like that, but here it's really true. Take Questo Amori, for instance. After listening to that song, I literally...literally had the imprints of tiny, little hearts appearing all over my body, and I was also able to literally shoot hearts out of my chest (just like that Care Bear). The song was pure love itself. On Splendida, the little men of Il Volvo express their love for Splenda, the sugar-substitute that is supposed to be healthier for you. Finally, on Bienvenido Nuestro Amor, the little fellas sing about what having sex for the first time will be like for them (AKA, losing their virginity). I was just ravished by the ultra-hot, 50-Shades-of-Gray themes that included bo\/n\/d\/a\/ge, submission and, of course, spooning. Mama Mia!\n\nIn summary, I think I am developing a crush for Mario, Luigi and, yes, even Santorini. I mean, take a look at them on the cover of We Are Love. If it's not the bushy, caterpillar-like eyebrows of the fop on the left or the coke-bottle glasses of the fop on the right, then it's definitely the AC\/DC quality of the dandy in the middle that just makes my heart sing.

{"text":"(2 & 1\/2 stars) In my youth Chicago was one of my very favorite bands - in the top 2 or 3 for sure.  When I played trumpet back then, I even had the trumpet parts memorized from songs like \"Questions 67 and 68.\"  I even enjoyed their more \"lite rock\" phase of the '80s.  But all of that was then and this is now.  Their new \"XXX\" is not so hot.  The main problem is epitomized by the 2nd track on the CD, \"King of Might Have Been.\"  It's a mildly pretty ballad along the lines of \"You're The Inspiration.\"  The big obvious differences are in the current talent then versus now.  \"Inspiration\" featured the winning vocals of Peter Cetera (no longer in the band); \"King\" has the merely competent Jason Scheff singing.  The new song was produced and arranged by Jay DeMarcus (who?); \"Inspiration\" was filled with shimmering, subtle and beautiful touches created by the incomparable David Foster.  \"King\" is a very ordinary and unmemorable tune; \"Inspiration\" is a classic that was co-written by Cetera and Foster.  And that example pretty much represents what happens on the album as a whole.  It's undoubtedly unfair to compare this new CD to Chicago's glory days, but the fact remains that it's a pale imitation.\n\nA couple of thoughts regarding the CD's title.  First, the album count has gotten shakier over the years.  I don't think that every regurgitated and repackaged collection (ex., \"Chicago Love Songs\") should count toward the total.  So really they are nowhere near 30 albums.  Second, the movie rating implications of \"XXX\" seem to have completely escaped them, as there is no mention of anything relating to that in the album booklet or art.","classification":2}

It also retains that cool Dubstep feel were you feel like you just can't sit down.

{"text":"I am a fan of Hip Hop not only in music but also the culture. I listen to a lot of rap music from the old gangsta rap music from N.W.A., to the intellectual teachings of KRS-One...to the raw lyrical deliveries from the likes of Nas, Rakim, Canibus...and also to the funky styles of A Tribe Called Quest so I know a little more about what good Hip Hop Music is really about. But over the last couple of years Hip Hop has been declining in quality of music, these days people only care about a good beat and don't care about the lyrical abilities of a rapper anymore. The most overrated and most talked about rapper would have to be Lil Wayne if anybody. People like Lil Wayne because of his so called \"hard hitting rhymes\" but in actuality its just kindergarden play on words and crappy analogies (but don't get me wrong because Lil Wayne does have his moments).\n\nDRAKE is the new rap phenomenom soon to become the new Lil Wayne, showing signs of upcoming success already working with some of musics veterans such as Kanye West, Mary J. Blige, Jay-Z, Eminem etc...This album is an EP of Drakes past songs mainly from his mixtape with the same name that came out earlier this year in February, as well as a couple of new ones. Drake doesn't have the same pinache as some rappers do, his delivery is basically the same in every song, his lyrical ability is questionable often reciting lines you would think Lil Wayne would say, and his musicality is very very basic. But even with all that negativity said, there is something about Drake I just like, he is basically the rapper in the game I hate to like.\n\n1) Houstatlantavegas - What makes Drake a bit better then other rappers is the fact that he has a little R&B touch to him, which makes him a lot more versitile in music. I acutally like Drakes voice when he sings even though he uses a little auto-tune to his voice. The song doesn't make much sense but its a nice opening song. 7\/10\n\n2) Successful feat. Trey Songz & Lil Wayne - a very long song, kinda boring at times. This song pretty much demonstrates the reasong why I believe Drake's flow is the same every time. His delivery is very boring at times and his lyrical ability is very cliche'. Trey Songz hook compliments the beat very well. I just think the song runs on a little too long, and Lil Wayne just comes up randomly at the end. 8\/10\n\n3) Best I Ever Had - this would have to be Drake's signature song. I heard this song back in March and thought it was OK at first. But then it came up on radio, it kept playing over and over again. Although this song is very overplayed, I still love it, its very catchy and definitely a song to be played over and over again. 10\/10\n\n4) Uptown feat. Bun B & Lil Wayne - yet another mong song running about 6 minutes long, and also yet another song featuring Lil Wayne. The song has a nice hook, I think I prefer Drakes singing over rapping cuz he just sounds very obnoxious over half of the time. Bun B has a strong verse and Lil Wayne yet again provides another short verse at the end. Good song but again runs a little too long. 9\/10\n\n5) I'm Goin In feat. Lil Wayne & Young Jeezy - Lil Wayne is on this album wayyyyy too much. This is a very cocky song, All three of em sound like a bunch of f***s, their delivery on this song is pretty decent but the lyrics are again obnoxious and don't really make much sense. This song however has a very hard bass hitting beat, this will be a song you would bump in your car fosho. 7\/10\n\n6) The Calm - The beat is actually very \"calm\" but Drake sounds very angry. His flow is the same (again) and the lyrics aren't that great. But the song itself isn't that bad. 6\/10\n\n7) Fearz - this is actually the only brand new song from Drake. The song is a lot better than the previous songs, his lyrics on this song is a lot better than previous songs. DJ Khalil provides a very nice beat and Drakes hook is pretty good. Not a bad way to end the album. 9\/10","classification":4}

{"text":"\"Black and Blue\" is the rock-music equivalent of a quickie, an album on which the Rolling Stones were motivated not by love or excitement so much as a simple need to do it, to get it out of their system.  They're slightly funkier and noticeably more relaxed, like addicts finally finding release (more accurately like randy guys getting laid): one can hear it on \"Hot Stuff\" or \"Hand of Fate,\" even on the lackadaisical reggae \"Cherry Oh Baby.\"  The Billy Preston-inspired \"Melody\" is memorable, because it's odd, but it's the album's emotional centerpieces, the designed centerpiece, \"Memory Motel,\" and the real thing, \"Fool to Cry,\" that stand out.  The music of \"Memory Motel\" shamelessly reaches for sentiment--shame on it--but Jagger's rawhide vocal and the honesty it adds to the lyrics save the song.  \"Fool to Cry\" is less appreciated than the album itself: it's straightforward, emotionally true, and sweet as the whisper of the song's little girl.  Not to be mistaken for a great Stones record, but sometimes a quickie just hits the spot.","classification":4}

{"text":"For those who grew up during the 70s like me or those who are just fans of the period The Pointer Sisters are infamous.  Bonnie Pointer was the creative force behind the original quartet and after years of huge success she broke from the group in 1976 and joined Motown.  Her first release was this gorgeous recording with the glorious red cover, her beautiful face and simply titled BONNIE POINTER.  Side one had the uptempo tracks and side two was more reflective.  There are glorious covers of WHEN I'M GONE and HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU. The Motown sound was again loud and strong.  But Bonnie also brought FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM a disco track with much funk and AH SHOOT.  The second side totally shined with emotional standouts MORE AND MORE and MY EVERYTHING.  Raw and emotional, Bonnie gave her all.\n\nThe album was a huge success and then HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was released as a disco track and it roared up all the charts and became a disco\/dance\/soul\/r&b classic.  It also brought even more attention to the amazing album.  Here BBR has done their magic and brought this superb release to life with beautiful and glorious remastering.  The sound is amazing.  What a gift.  And then we get 5 bonus tracks and a huge booklet of pictures and extensive liner notes.  If this release brings back memories it has never sounded better.  I highly recommend it to fans of soul\/disco\/r&b as well as fans of the 70s.  And a huge thanks to BBR.  You are reuniting listeners to the true music classics the way they were meant to be heard.  Don't hesitate to purchase this.  The crystal clear sound of Bonnie's pure vocals will pull you in from beginning to end.","classification":5}

{"text":"I've been a fan of Old 97's for a while now, so it's easy for me to recommend \"Hit By a Train: The Best of Old 97's.\" The only problem I'm having is trying to figure out exactly why this is considered a \"best of.\" Quite frankly, each of their albums stand quite well on their own, and in many ways equals the overall quality of this collection. There are a few songs here that I personally would not have included, (\"their rendition of \"El Paso\", for instance), while there are plenty of songs from each studio album whose inclusion would have been easily justified (\"Wreck Your Life\"'s \"W-I-F-E\" and \"The Other Shoe,\" and \"Too Far to Care\"'s \"Streets Where I'm From\", for instance). Nevertheless, \"Hit By a Train\" is an entertaining listen from start to finish. In that sense, this is more of a sampler than a collection of their best hits.\n\nMiller has a tendency toward song-title puns that don't do justice to the songs themselves (\"Cryin' Drunk,\" \"Crash on the Barrelhead\" - not included here), but this only points out his self-consciously clever way with a phrase. The band has obviously mastered the two-step `train beat' (3 tracks here) and the hard-bouncing \"Texas shuffle\" (which accounts for eight of the CD's eighteen tracks), but it's Miller's lyrics that keep you coming back for more, even after repeated listens. Miller's albums as a solo artist certainly hold up well, but it's his work with Old 97's that is most effective, which is why this collection works as well as it does. How can you not love an album containing \"Barrier Reef,\" \"Lonely Holiday,\" \"Jagged\" and \"Victoria,\" all on the same disk? \"Hit By a Train\" encapsulates some of the band's best moments, and hardcore fans of the band will want this if only for the non-album tracks (the above-mentioned \"El Paso\" and \"Cryin' Drunk\"), but casual fans would do well to continue exploring their catalog further.

Then suddenly, you realize it's won your heart.* I love the minor key of this song. I tugs at my heart and attempts to draw my very soul out. I actually visualize the darkened rooms in the evening. Then I see a young man pleading with his girlfriend to take steps toward a commitment she isn't sure she's ready for. Looking back over my fifty years, I didn't appreciate this ballad so much as I do now. I am fortunate that I've been married more than half of my life to the same man. Yet I see so many young kids getting married and I hope that they are doing it for love, not just because they're expected to. I hope that women especially will realize that they are forever someone's daughter. Someday, God willing, they will become a mother and grandmother -- but when will they ever just be themselves?

{"text":"Why so much attention to the flute repertoire in the Vanguard\/Bach Guild catalog? And, to further complicate, why is most of the repertoire well outside the usual baroque-era specialization that helped to define the label? In fact, there is less than 2 hours of baroque and classical era flute music played on original instruments (Tafelmusik, Production III with Harnoncourt and the Concentus Musicus Wien). However, as the potential buyer of this Big Flute Box can see, the Bach Guild can easily offer over 10 hours of flute repertoire.\nSome of the answer comes from the role of the record label in the 1950s  labels rushed to offer their versions of the standard repertoire, or, with flute repertoire, commercially viable recordings that might be just slightly off the mainstream path.\nThe recordings during this time frame feature Julius Baker, the first chair flutist from the Columbia Symphony Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic, and head of the Curtis School of Musics flute program. His recordings were all orchestral, and were made with I Solisti di Zagreb. Baker covered the complete orchestral works for flute of Mozart, and assorted flute works were used as filler for those three LPs.\nBaker referred one of his star pupils to Seymour Solomon, and Vanguard was able to expand its flute catalog using the talents of Paula Robison. Having covered most of the commercial flute repertoire, Robisons recordings for Vanguard are all in the recital vein. The heart of her excellent contributions to the Vanguard catalog are the complete flute sonatas of J.S. Bach and George Frederic Handel. Together with world-class partners Kenneth Cooper and Timothy Eddy, these recordings have been a bedrock of Vanguards catalog for over 30 years.\nPaula Robisons adventurous repertoire pushed Vanguard into recording flute music well outside the brand name composers, and much of that fine music is featured here, again with top-notch accompanists like the Tokyo String Quartet and pianist Samuel Sanders. All of this material has been released on CD, but this Big Box does mark much of its appearance in digital download form.","classification":5}

{"text":"I like steampunk. I like Weird West. I like comic book adaptations. I like movies that bust out of the usual genre cliches.\n\nBut it's not an unconditional love -- the loathing I have for \"Jonah Hex\" proves it. This movie is a bit like the evil love child of \"Wild Wild West\" and \"Van Helsing,\" with all the bloodcurdling stupidity of the former and the flashy steampunky trappings of the latter. Josh Brolin does his best to salvage this messy undercooked stew of cliches, but honestly... there's no saving this movie.\n\nJonah Hex (Brolin) was a Confederate soldier who turned against his commander Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), and Turnbull got his revenge by killing Hex's family, scarring his face and leaving him for dead on a cross. Of course he doesn't die, but becomes a bounty hunter who can communicate with the dead just by touching them. All this is crammed in the first three minutes.\n\nThen the president recruits him to hunt down Turnbull, who is building \"the weapon\" that could destroy the entire United States. So he meanders off and brawls with some people, gets some crossbow-guns (what?), and rushes to rescue his favorite hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold (is there any other kind in movies?).\n\nI wish I could give a better summary of the plot in \"Jonah Hex,\" but that's kind of like examining the acting talent displayed by Megan Fox -- it's so minimal that you'll just sprain your brain if you try to actually talk about it. Jonah is traumatized, he shoots people, he gets drafted, he shoots people, he goes searching for Turnbull, he shoots people, and so on and so forth.\n\nBasically there's not much plot here, so the writers pad it with as many fiery explosions, gunfights and hallucinatory flashbacks as they possibly can. The dialogue is leaden (\"Ain't mah country. Git lost or git dead\"), and all the dramatic twists are painfully predictable. As for \"the weapon,\" it is quite possibly the silliest superweapon I have EVER seen in a movie, short of a giant slingshot. THIS is supposed to be able to bring down a budding superpower?\n\nI'll give Brolin credit, he does what he can, and he slurs and grinds around his fake facial deformity with convincing grittiness. The problem is, his character's backstory is so hastily slapped together that it's hard to care -- I mean, it's sad that his family died, but we barely even SAW them and don't see much of how he felt. Megan Fox is all flat drawling and vacuous stares, but fortunately she only has a few scenes. During the more dramatic moments you can almost see smoke coming out of her ears.\n\n\"Jonah Hex\" is all wasted potential -- it has pretty much no plot, not much decent acting, and an ending worthy of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000.\" Give it a pass.","classification":1}

This just proves how little of Pitbull is actually in this track (not song), and just how unoriginal and unimaginative today's top hits can be.\n\nWhat further disturbs me is that people can actually admit that a track like this copies the melody of an earlier (and far superior quality) song, and yet they say things like, \"yeah, but it gets the club hoppin!\"\n\n***FACEPALM***\n\nSeriously, since when does being able to \"get down\" have to be the only thing that matters?

{"text":"It is so sad that someone like Mariah Carey has been very poor and weak in regards to her songs that she has covered. Honestly, throughout Mariah Carey's career, she really has been very poor at really finding the right songs that have matched her soul in covers, and sonnets from her heart. Musically, she does not have the ear and voice for covers within the soul that songstresses like the great Whitney Houston and Celine Dion have had with covers and delivered from the soul overall. Hard to believe that there were only two cover songs that Mariah Carey had delivered on very well. Her rendition of the Jackson 5's I'll Be There, and Endless Love with Luther Vandross in 1994. But otherwise, it has been more of a waste from Mariah Carey overall. Her rendition of Foreigner's I Want To Know What Love Is, has a few problems overall. One is that she does not sing a key verse that Lou Gramm did so well, \"This Mountain I Must Climb Feels Like The World Upon My Shoulder...\", a huge bust from Mariah. Second of all, Mariah Carey sounds cheaper with her 80's covers over the years: Against All Odds by Phil Collins, Journey's Opens Arms and Def Leppard's Bringing On The Heartbreak from 2003's Charmbracelet. This is one song I would not recommend for any die hard Mariah Carey fan, and for new ones alike. She does not want to know what love is, after her wasted past few marriages, and with the musical ear.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3}

Katy loses her fake I.D. and I think her \"boyfriend\" has lost the room key.\n\nIt's OK, but could be better.

{"text":"Pink Martini simply never fails to please their adoring fans; and their latest album is certainly no exception! Yes, there is one semi-misstep along the way, but even then the musical arrangement on that track is quite well done--and the rest of the CD is so outstanding I can just about overlook it. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and the artwork is terrific.\n\nThe album starts with Pink Martini performing \"Ninna Nanna;\" this romantic, poignant tune is sung with grace and style by China Forbes with a fine male chorus backup. The Latin flavor of the musical accompaniment enhances the song and The Harvey Rosencrantz Orchestra makes this absolutely charming, not to mention hauntingly beautiful. What a pretty song with which to open up the album! \"Ohayoo Ohio (Hello Ohio)\" starts with great percussion and that piano sounds great. The drums and the brass come in as this number takes flight--\"Ohayoo Ohio (Hello Ohio)\" is exquisite music from Pink Martini and they harmonize faultlessly although this is primarily instrumental. Listen also for the title track which boasts a wonderful piano arrangement; China Forbes' sophisticated phrasing makes her performance shine--what a songbird she is! \"Splendor in the Grass\" lingers in my mind long after I listen to it--and what a creative way to work in Tchaikovsky's work, too!\n\n\"O&ugrave; Est Ma Tte?\" has China Forbes singing once again and she never sounded better! This tender love song about a woman who wants her man back that she's falling to pieces touches me greatly; and once again that Latin sounding music fits in perfectly with the vocals. Impressive! \"And Then You're Gone\" is another poignant tune with the ensemble handling complex key and tempo changes like the pros they are--and it's wonderful to say the least. \"But Now I'm Back\" is quite creative; it even incorporates music by Schubert! Ari Shapiro swings brightly to make this shine; and how's about that brass? The male backup vocalists are very good, too. \"Sunday Table\" is a very well written song about a couple who could have had a true and passionate love affair but they just can't quite connect to make it last.\n\n\"Over The Valley\" is both touching and sweet while \"Tuca Tuca\" is much more playful; the upbeat tempo works wonders for this Italian song about two people who are in \"like\" but it just may turn into love before long. Phil Baker plays the sitar remarkably well on \"Tuca Tuca;\" and listen for \"Bitty Boppy Betty,\" a catchy song about a man who gets his kicks going around dressed up as a woman on the weekends! The music sounds like a 1920s arrangement and Pink Martini does this with lots of energy to make it work.\n\nAs for \"Sing\" by Joe Raposo, some may say it's syrupy-sweet but I like it. It's a classic, upbeat and charming tune that Pink Martini does beautifully in both English and Spanish. Unfortunately, I now come to the album's only misstep, \"Piensa En M&iacute;\" sung by Chavela Vargas. I hate to write this but they should have picked another person to sing this song. Chavela's advanced age (she's ninety) makes her singing somewhat flat and that's a disappointment. On the bright side, however, the piano and the violin sound great.\n\nThe album ends with two wonderful numbers, \"New Amsterdam,\" a valentine to New York City, and a reprise of \"Ninna Nanna\" with a more stripped down musical arrangement that distinguishes it from the first version at the very beginning of this track set.\n\nPink Martini gave us yet another reason to love them with this CD release; it's an absolute must-have for their fans. It's also an excellent starter CD for people just discovering their incredible talent.","classification":5}

{"text":"The whole point behind covering a song is to A) better the original or B) shake things up and make it different than the original. So when Rick Springfield announced that he was taking a break from songwriting and was recording a full album's worth of covers, made up of songs he'd always loved and wished he had written, I thought \"Cool...this just might work!\" Sadly, that's just not the case...THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is a tepid affair, with pretty much note-for-note arrangements of the original versions and weak, at times almost lazy, vocals. Now, I believe each and every one of us is entitled to their own opinion when writing a review like this, but I gotta be honest with you...I'm really shocked to read some of the die-hard fan's reviews stating that this CD captures and exhibits Springfield's true talents. Believe me, in MY opinion, none of the vocal nuances, emotions or guitar wizardry that was evident on his last two releases (1999's KARMA and last year's powerful SHOCK\/DENIAL\/ANGER\/ACCEPTANCE) are anywhere to be found on this latest CD. Things kick off with a gauzy version of 10CC's \"I'm Not In Love.\" I'm sure Springfield's breathy lead vocal is supposed to represent pain and anguish but, in the end, it just comes across as over the top. And don't even get me started on how silly and dated the \"Big boys don't cry\" lyric sounds 30 years down the line! (Though the \"I keep your picture\/Upon the wall\/It hides a nasty stain\/Just lying there\/So don't you ask me\/To give it back\" still packs a wallop!). Things continue along the same path with \"Under The Milky Way\", \"Life In A Northern Town\" and \"Broken Wings.\" Oh, sure, \"Under....\" has some nice acoustic guitar work, while there's a genuine earnestness to Springfield's vocal on \"....Town\" but, ultimately, each track - particularly the last two - collapses under the weight of various wrong turns (length and an over-blown chorus for \"Town\", an awful vocal arrangement and truly dated vibe for \"Wing\"). No, things don't really kick in until the fifth cut, the ethereal \"Human.\" Springfield not only manages to capture the pain of the original, he builds on and betters it. All the elements that made this a hit over twenty years ago are still there (a true testament to the writing genius of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis!), but thee's also a freshness and vulnerability that reverberates throughout the track. My only complaint....the cheesy pseudo-British female backing vocal (used two or three times too many throughout the disc!); I think the track would have had even more puch if Springfield had instead asked a fellow 80's survivor (say, Martha Davis, Terri Nunn or Pat Benatar) to join him. \"Holding On To Yesterday\" starts out with a nice, sultry groove, but then the horns kick in and the histrionic lead vocal sends the whole thing over and off the deep end. Moving in any number of directions, this is a song that ultimately spins out of control, not sure which course it wanted to take. \"Baker Street\" is another track that (sadly) fizzles. Yes, the sizzling guitars and wailing sax are intoxicating, but that's nothing new....they were 25+ years ago when Gerry Rafferty first released the song. You can't better it, you can't improve upon it, you certainly can't change it.....so why even try?!? All I can think of is Rick wanted to (re)introduce a classic to his younger fans...if that's the case, good for him! \"Waiting For A Girl Like You\" might have been a nifty left-field choice to include on SHOCK\/DENIAL\/ANGER\/ACCEPTANCE, but here it just seems very run-of-the-mill. It's at this point that things picked up for me on the disc...not knowing much about Blue Nile, Westlife and Lizz Wright, their tracks almost seemed like new, original material to me. Couple that with a Beatles track and a John Lennon cut, plus the sole Springfield original, and you have many of the strongest moments on THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY. \"Let's Go Out Tonight\" has a smokey, sexy quality to it, with some beautiful sax snaking in and out and a plaintive lead vocal coaxing the listener in. Add some delicate keyboards and muted percussion and you have the disc's best track. Covering the Beatles is always tough, but you just have to plug your nose and jump in feet first, and that's what Springfield does on \"For The One.\" Much like \"Human\", he honors the original, but manages to put his own spin on things, making it sound fresh, contemporary and, most importantly, like it was one of his own. There's an understated quality to \"Miss You Nights\" that's both captivating and mesmerizing....the arrangement is thoughtful and uncluttered, while Springfield's vocal both soars and swirls. Another winner! \"Blue Rose\" is absolutely elegant, with a raspy, yet sincere, lead vocal and a jazz club combo-vibe to the arrangement...piano, guitar, drums and (especially!) sax all come together brilliantly. \"Cry\" is the disc's lone original cut, a powerful track that could have easily fit on S\/D\/A\/A. With it's soaring lead vocal and thoughtful lyrics (\"You've got to cry\/And surrender to it tonight\/Time alone\/Won't heal your wounds\/It just makes you numb\"), it's yet another strong number. Things wrap up with \"Imagine\", a VERY tough song to cover (I mean, c'mon, it's JOHN LENNON's signature song!)....let's just say, Springfield doesn't embarrass himself. Unfortunately, that can't be said about THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY as a whole....after two very strong releases, this disc is a definite step -or two!- backwards for Rick Springfield (Normally, I would also be docking the disc another half a star for not including the lyrics, but I know acquiring the publishing rights to a disc's worth of cover tunes could be costly, so I'll waive that rule here).","classification":2}

I liked it instantly. As the song concluded Tom, said, \"that was the new single from Jennifer Holiday\" .  I almost instantly knew that it was Jennifer Hudson, he corrected himself by saying that because they were both associated with Dreamgirls he often confused their names.  Actually, it isn't that hard since both have the same first names.  According to Amazon, six people have reviewed the album and given it a solid five stars.  I guess they are privy to advance copies, it must be nice but I'm not hatin. I anticipate it will be as good as they say if the first single is any indication.

He had 50 a couple of years ago, but he's had so many since than, I honestly don't know.\n\nThis set documents most of his best work of the 1990s, and includes two mighty fine new recordings, 'The Best Day' and the duet with country music legend Alan Jackson, 'Murder On Music Row.' You also get some of his finest songs of the 1990s as a country chart topper, including 'Lead On' and 'Carrying Your Love With Me.'\n\nAnd, MCA did a great job remastering the songs too. The sound quality is excellent!\n\nOverall, this is a great set to own. And if you own 'Greatest Hits Vol. 2' and\/or 'Greatest Hits,' pair it with this, and you have a mighty fine George collection.\n\nHighly recommended for the new or casual Strait fan.

{"text":"\"Rebel Yell\" is a very enjoyable and daring passionate lust song. As per the songfacts website, \"Rebel Yell\" is basically about a one night stand that is very pleasurable that the lover ends up expressing that they want more. This is also made clear with the following lyrics:\nIn the midnight hour she cried- \"more, more, more\"\nWith a rebel yell she cried- \"more, more, more\"\nIn the midniight hour babe- \"more, more, more\"\nWith a rebel yell- \"more, more, more\"\nMore, more, more.\n\n Obviously, there is more to this gem of a song. Billy Idol really puts alot of his spirit into the song in such an excellent fashion that it is almost like he is telling a very entertaining story that he is simultaneously singing. I admit that I first heard this song when I was a teenager, and I currently still love listening to this song. The guitar riffs and his fantastic singing blend well together with this song to make it a musical track that is fun to listen to multiple times in a row. \"Rebel Yell\" is also another song to put in a love\/lust playlist and\/or 80's classic song playlist","classification":5}

{"text":"Four years after the release of their highly successful self-titled album, the most prominent Christian rock band from Texas -- Flyleaf -- have reunited with producer Howard Benson to dish out their long-awaited sophomore effort, \"Memento Mori.\" While the first album had more of a garage band edge to it, the follow-up finds the band shedding away some of their punkier second-rate Nirvana influences in favor for a much more polished and radio-ready sound. This should come as no surprise though, as Flyleaf are one of those rare rock bands nowadays who can sell a record and since their debut was a bit raw and immature.\n\nTouring heavily with the likes of Korn and Disturbed has done little to soften the band's strong Christian themes. In fact, on \"Memento Mori,\" such moments are much clearer than ever. For some this could be a turn-off, but for the (ahem) faithful followers, it may be a plus. Put plain and simple, Lacey loves Jesus and wants to make sure you know all about it. Putting that aside, though, the album is certainly a notch above the first as far as musicianship goes. While the band has yet to establish a distinctive style, they back up Lacey's broad themes and unique voice well, and Benson's improved production only serves to give the whole affair more bombast and sonic improvements. Put simply, this is the same Flyleaf you know already, just marginally improved and perfected.\n\nIf \"Memento Mori\" has one fatal flaw, though, it's that the songs tend to blend into one another without a single moment sticking out. While there isn't necessarily a bad song to be found, it can be an overall taxing album to listen to and certainly begs the question of whether or not it will continue Flyleaf's string of success. At the end of the day, their second effort improves on almost all fronts, leaving memorable song-writing on the back-burner. Chalk it up to a burnt-out producer (seriously, what album HASN'T Howard Benson produced this year?) and a slightly immature band. Hopefully album number three irons out some of the wrinkles, but in the meantime, this will suffice.","classification":4}

The album kicks especially the sound \"Hood Scriptures\" which is actually the most incredible song ever written. Believe it, rap and latino music blend together nicely.

Lil Kim said in her album, that people had the gall to be re-writting her rhymes and Foxy says that people can do the thing she does. The lines are probably sent for one rapper to the other. Foxy also said in her song Fallin \"I shed tears when Biggie and Pac got killed, there's only one other broad who really got skill, she's alright, but she's not real\". Is this for Lil Kim, maybe.

{"text":"hours worth of material.  It is an ambitious project to be sure, and one that I predict would not sway fans or non-fans either way on their opinions of the band.  Everything that people love or loathe about TSO can be found here.  This is symphonic \/ progressive \/ broadway rock at its most bombastic.  For fans of the bands pre-TSO incarnation, Savatage, at least some of this will sound similar in style and substance.  In fact this is probably the most Savatage like album TSO has done so far.  Bottom line, if you have liked TSOs other albums (or Savatages more rock opera ish releases); you will probably enjoy this one.  If previous TSO efforts have turned you off, this one will probably not do anything to change that point of view.","classification":4}

Wrecking Ball from her upcoming album Bangerz is definitely a wasted record. Fr her to team up with Mike Will Made It on the song 23, she does not even ignite into the song. In fact, she is someone that whimps out her voice and rap into the drive. I definitely could see if he wanted to hire someone more famous into the song like Britney Spears or Beyonce' Knowles. But having Miley into the song, actually turns the song into a waste of time. I really do not recommend downloading this song, not only because it is cheap. It sometimes shows that the right person can also make a song come alive. This 23 is definitely a bust.\n\nSong: D","classification":2}

Ian Hunter had clearly taken control of the band authoring or co-authoring 8 of the 9 songs. This doesn't diminish Mick  Ralphs contributions--his guitar playing is terrific and his single solo  composition(He wrote three other tracks with Hunter) is a terrific song.\nAlong with Brain Capers, this is the band's finest hour. After this  Ralphs left the band leaving a gaping hole that, perhaps, only Mick Ronson  could have filled if he and Hunter had stayed with the band. I Wish I Was  Your Mother and Violence are two of the highlights from this terrific  album.\nNow if only Columbia would remaster this as well as they did the  Import of All The Young Dudes, it would be a perfect album!","classification":5}

{"text":"Susan Boyle's second CD, just released for Christmas shoppers I suppose, it quite a disappointment. First the music selections which she says in her notes she is not responsible for-- or said another way: \"I wish to thank the following in helping me with this album: Simon Cowell and Nick Raymonds for picking the songs.\" The front cover has a picture of the Star of Bethlehem so we are to assume the CD is a Christmas one. Not completely. Also included with \"O Holy Night,\" \"Away In a Manager,\"O Come All Ye Faithful\" and other Christmas selections are Lou Reed's \"Perfect Day,\" Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\"-- while I love this piece, it's been recorded to death and Ms. Boyle's interpretation adds no new dimension to it-- and \"Make Me A Channel of Your Peace.\"\n\nThen there are the arrangements. What on earth were they thinking? Did nobody listen to what was the final product before unleashing it onto the public? The background music gets so loud at times that it is impossible to set the proper volume setting on whatever you are playing this CD on. The liner notes indicate that we have a piano, keyboards, synths, organ, guitars, drums, accordion (the fruitcake of instruments), with soloists, Children's Choir, Young Musicians and Classical Choir although it is difficult to really tell what is going on with these really awful arrangements. I suppose we blame either the mixer, producer and arranger, orchestral and choral arranger or all of the above-- certainly not the poor singer. I kept wanting to hear Ms. Boyle singing with just a piano and maybe a cello or violin to accompany her. Now that would have been something to hear.\n\nWhat keeps this CD from being totally without redemption is the glorious silver voice of Ms. Boyle. She deserves better as do her fans. Had I had the opportunity to hear this CD in the store, I would hever have purchased it.","classification":3}
{"text":"Though this album did not contain two of his most well-known radio hits, the classics \"Mornin'\" and \"We're In This Love Together,\" this album is a thoroughly enjoyable collection of songs that those two songs might have sounded more at home on. Even without them, this album contains a number of notable songs of different styles. It has the bouncy, nicely stylized \"Imagination,\" the gritty, bopping funk number \"Sticky Wicket,\" and the beautiful adult contemporary hit \"After All\" which is very stylistically similar to Mornin' and We're In This Love Together. A must for any fan of adult contemporary pop-soul.","classification":5}

{"text":"As another reviewer noted, Prine's voice seems to have deteriorated a bit in recent years, but he still retains the charm, humor, and passion that has made him such a revered singer\/songwriter. A few notable guests make apperances, among them Emmylou Harris, Josh Ritter, and Iris Dement, but despite the high quality of talent amongst that bunch, I feel that they don't really add much to the overall enjoyment of the songs. When it comes down to it, it's John Prine we love and John Prine we want. Anything else just dilutes the power of the songs. Anyway, the songs performed here are well chosen, and it's always wonderful to hear Prine's ad-libs between songs. The man remains a charmer and we're blessed to have him out there still making music. This isn't the best live Prine album, and not the best album for someone wanting to hear John Prine for the fist time, but there's enough here to please longtime fans.","classification":4}

{"text":"Make no mistake - Jackson Browne is one of the greats. At first one might not agree, but after several listens one notices how amazing the production, instrumentation, lyrics and vocals are! The lyrics especially are very memorable and poetic at the same time - the emotion in Jackson's delivery is completely believable and genuine. You can tell a lot of heart and soul went into this record (on a side note the producer who worked with Jackson said himself that Jackson was very tough in the recording studio. Jackson wanted to make everything PERFECT which stressed everyone else out. His dedication, though, truly proves that it was worth it when you listen to these songs). The only downside to the album is that there are really only 5 great songs, and the rest can't really compete.

In fact I don't have much in my music library recorded after 2003 when I started working full time and stopped being cool....but this is just good pop music. I can't dislike it if I try. I did kind of try, but it's just so catchy I can't help myself. 3AM particularly gets to me.\n\nIn other words, this is worth trying out even if you're not into catchy pop stuff. I generally hate catchy pop stuff but I love this.","classification":5}

{"text":"I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play \"Amarillo By Morning,\" and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to \"Amarillo by Morning.\"\n\nSo, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy\/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered.","classification":5}

{"text":"It seems like whenever there is a remake of a classic film, it ne ver seems to shine in the way the original scored with movie lovers. That honestly was the case with the remake of Footloose earlier this year, and sadly the new version of the title song by Blake Shelton, Footloose, doesn't seem to spark like the way Kenny Loggins did it back in the 80's. While Blake did bring a bit of a country twang into the song, it still doesn't capture like the way Kenny Loggins did it. I do hope that the next time Blake does a cover of a classic movie song, he can make it more of his own than let the original feel more like a better bet on the ears.\n\nSong: C","classification":3}

{"text":"About five years ago,I got seriously into the whole Daptone label music scene. The whole theme they had was very authentically retro. It wasn't just the instrumental style of the music that came out of it. It was the sound of the recordings,even the old school film based photographic style of cover art. Charles Bradley is their key male solo artist. And his chief musical influence was James Brown-even working part time impersonating the man. As for me I have his first two albums. And was very excited to pick up his third when it came out. Again,there's no disappointment.\n\nThe album opens with a partially spoken word,organ\/piano based version of \"God Bless America\" where Bradly discussed the pros and cons of being black in this country. \"Good To Be Back Home\" is stomping,bluesy funk with phat electric guitar and horn accents throughout. \"Nobody But You\",the title song,\"Crazy For Your Love\" and the closer \"Slow Love\" are all reverbed guitar heavy ballads while \"Ain't Gonna Give You Up\" is a thick,slow deep funk groove with a bee like synthesizer buzzing. \"Things We Do For Love\" is a brightly melodic uptempo gospel\/soul number filled with multiple backup singers and \"You Think I Don't Know (But I Know\" has the same vibe about it. \"Change For The World\" is an brief late 60's\/early 70's Ike Hayes like psychedelic funk message song warning about the revival of segregationist racial behavior.\n\nIn a lot of ways,this might just be the very best album Charles Bradley has made thus far. The backup instrumentation of instrumentals such as the Budos Band provide a sound that is squarely in both the deep Southern soul and psychedelic funk sound of the late 60's. The vocals and arrangements are full of enormous drama as well. Bradley's voice,especially on his impassioned howls,are echoed intensely throughout nearly every song here. With a large focus on uptempo songs,this really brings out the full power of what this artist has had to offer up musically from his very outset.","classification":5}

{"text":"When it has came down to Ed Sheeran, he had made some of the best songs of the past several years when he came out with his Plus album. Songs like The A Team and Lego House were actually great trips back to when songs were worth listening too, because the heart was in the right place with the notes. But for him to follow up a great set of songs is a hard task. But for his latest song, Sing from his second album X, isn't exactly what you had expected from him. It tries and brings in a more pop-oriented rhythm in a simple acoustic form, by a simple guitar. Sadly, I didn't find the song to be as driven as it was made. It is a alright song, but not really anything worth raving about. Hopefully, there will be more good songs from Ed down the road, something more like what he had to sing about before.\n\nSong: C 1\/2+","classification":3}

{"text":"There is no question that it has been very hard to see a remake of a charity single to deliver for a whole new generation. But when it has came down to the ebola outbreak throughout Africa earlier this year, it really has put fear and struck the world over with sadness, and a feared travesty. But when Bob Geldof had heard about it, he decided to remake Do They Know It's Christmas? like he did for African famine. The song which gathers, Bono from U2 which did the original version with George Michael, Sting and Phil Collins to name a few, Chris Martin from Coldplay and Seal as few artists who remade the song. The song doesn't actually ignite as strong as the original version from years ago, but honestly it doesn't feel watered down the way the We Are The World was remade in regards to the crisis in Haiti in 2010. Still, it is a better remake and a good cause, and had a little more for the money. It is a good cause and a nice download for helping the cause in Africa. Now only if Bob could do something to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Live Aid.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4}

{"text":"This was another great jazz artist that I didn't know much about prior to this Ken Burn's release. I never thought that I could love the sound of the soprano sax this much. Up until this album, whenever I thought of soprano sax, Kenny G and his mind numbing music would come to mind, and I would cringe. But, this album opened up a whole new world of music to me .. now THIS is how a soprano sax should sound. It is beautiful. Sidney Bechet is (or was) a true genius, the way he made the horn almost operatic in sound, with the wonderful throbbing vibratos. No wonder he was sometimes billed as \"The Talking Saxophone\". There is such depth and emotion in his playing. I highly recommend this album to all jazz fans. The booklet includes photos and an interesting essay.","classification":5}

{"text":"Trent Reznor has laid the groundwork for music distribution. Trent Reznor is God. Well, maybe he had lots of help and a few Talking Heads fans to back him up, but he has done it, RIGHT! Fork over 5 dollars on the NIN site and you get 320kb download with a large free collection of above average landscape photography, PDF, and the whole thing is carried off but with hardly any pretense minus that of being a premier musician and all around artist trying to expand their box, a prison that Trent Reznor has finally busted I might add. NIN have taken things to a new level that has actually set precedent for the paradigm. And to boot, if you want bigger and better CD\/Vinyl sets he says 10 dollars to 300 dollars, depending how rabid you are over his sexual presence on this earth, of course with various trinkets and the obligatory signature signed with His own blood.\n\nGhosts 19 I stole because it TOTALLY sounded like superior Skinny Puppy 1990. You figure the terrible ninties. GET that. HAHA. NiNties. Uh........ Ghosts 6 I come back to because it reminds me of the good ol' days with SAW Vol. 2. How it so could fit on there, perfectly, and yet it sounds as if TRez had these sound in him his whole life, which, he has, only he was forced into making texture pop with voice, (damn that voice) decrepit and decayed as his pop may be. 31 Ghosts is amazing for the wailing banshee guitar, courtesy of Adrian Belew?, and it is welcome that one of my favorite King Crimson guitarists is given more due NIN time than usual, as he appears on many tracks. Reverse that and 13 is a beautiful piano driven peace ode to death, breathing courtesy of Trent? What a great track, though, I really dig the Fragile leftover Ghosts 34: a compliment that was, because the sound is reminiscent of certain tracks that were Tony Tiger GREAT back in 1999, I even hear them using some of the same equipment I think. Ghosts 28 is tonal and tribal, a stark representation of landscape maybe, gently rolling along the hills, the sound invading every crack and crevice, raw and harsh.\n\nAnother track I truly enjoyed was Ghosts 24 from III that does what Prodigy should have been doing after Fat of the Land NO ******* kidding. Ghosts 5, to take a stark detour, is mostly Sergio Leone leftover depression.... Oh.... yeah... most people don't have this type of depression.... 21 is like a mishmash of Into the Void and every trick Trent has learned from two decades of experience in layering his music.\n\nAll the material is excellent, in my opinion, and if you are familiar with Still, than you know where this collection is going, just above and beyond the pretty and sombre lamentations found there.\n\nGhosts I-IV looks very promising, and the entire package is worth any music lover's time, and that it will for all this to sink in. Just Being a NIN fan of The Fragile and TDS in particular, this new work is complex as those and even more stunning in many other respects, just as Still was a nice complement to And All That.... Ghosts is the complementary side of Year Zero, evoking everything from Debussy's La Mer to Autechre's Confield to Aphex Twin Druqks; even the buzz saw guitars and streaming bass lines of punk and new wave era Cure come through with ZING on Ghosts 4. I honestly don't know what to say about the preceding track because it alone is worth the price of admission to download this whole album. Ghosts 3 is amazing. Very Richard like but then again it is wholly the creation of Trent. I love the sickly tangy guitar instrument at 2:00, with the overlaying distortions, voices, synths, etc. and of course the bassline! Can't forget that NIN bass line, morphing into guitar, swooning around beats and loops and Lalalalalal yeah the point is that many of the tracks are evocative mind trips that serve headphones, amps, and darkness well.\n\nTDS is almost universally admired if not for songwriting then production and arrangement. The Fragile was a masterpiece in its own space and mind, forging ahead the new digital era with samples and tracks galore, incisors bared solemnly with nary a hint of hope to be redeemed; Left disc ended on The Great Below, one of the most poignant and interesting odes to love and death that NIN has ever written. THAT was followed by something we previously hadn't heard from NIN. The Right disc was amazing and fresh, including a rap, a shoutout, and complex instrumentals that further divided NIN from the LAME industrial landscape. The gigantic transducer eating beats surely convinced the bassheads of the blatant talent, too.\n\nI began to get the feeling that The Fragile was something special, broken and marred, but put together and soothing in the way that suffering, knowing suffering, leads eventually to change, slow as it might happen.\n\nSo after that whole experience in my late teens, five years later With Teeth was slightly disappointing, and a bit weak in the lyrical department. I kept wanting to hear the vicious instrumentals from before, or even unsubtle rage of Somewhat Damaged; instead, it was all chorus and pomp, and the raw emotion was definitely missing, though, some songs were inevitably quite provoking. Year Zero was definitely the Rockstar side revived, I enjoyed it because of the abrasive beats and the creativity of the song lyrics; the choruses seemed more appropriate and less in your face and that helps when you tire of a songs pop structure with repeated listening.\n\nBut this, this record I do not hold, Ghosts I-IV, is the Miles Davis spectre of an unconventional time working through world wide conflicts that affect individuals, as we may reflect in our art as the Jazz Master did with his bands for decades: the poets, painters, directors, etc. all do this is different ways. We who love to learn and share want something better than what currently is, and we are working on all levels to adjust our realities to what is happening, the tragedies that we know should not be taking place in our human world, the idea that things changed on an invisible level lead to change beyond, and if that thin line of inspiration comes from these little pieces of plastic and paper then YAY, the world is getting better right?\n\nAre you full of BULLSH**, crank? Are all artists full of this stuff you call Bullsh**?\n\nWell, I don't know, but the record is supremely satisfying; an aura exudes from this album that is the perfect representation of NIN's instrumental vision. They are pioneering not quite radical but comprehensive postmodern sound. Good things can only come from this, along with other artist's to follow, even novelist's and poet's should take notice, the internet is the Argus, you are a part of us, taking this music industry beyond what it is now, taking the entertainment industry and edging one notch for the artist alone, as  a man or woman, only 400 more blows till we kill the uncouth blubbery PIG that never wanted to share its profits.\n\nI, Disciple 16, rarely buy in stores anymore; actually I don't at all, though, BMG online has enabled me to collect dozens of double sets, remasters that I could not get any other way. I don't think, if you look hard enough, the industry is dead, it was just waiting for the intro to a new AGE. As a consumer, you had to be wary, and if you weren't, BubblePop METAL would and will be sold to you with dumptrucks, peddled on the radio because you haven't the time to choose.\n\nOh well whatever nevermind crank get on with it OKAY this isn't going to change everything, but at this stage corporate rock has killed the radio and we all know it. Radio aversely affects what is popular and 'they' want to sell us everything we don't need to hear, nothing daring, all angst and facades, veils of illusion. This distribution model shows us that ART carried off with great taste can survive by the consumer alone. The late 60's period this is not. We have to start choosing what we want, and now we have a line that has been crossed, successfully.\n\nSo beyond the advertisement for this album, Ghosts exists in the senses that imply change, reflection, and the will to follow through these harsh times. I can recall instrumentals like Just Like You Imagined, Complication, and A Warm Place that changed my mind on who Trent was becoming. Indeed, like the reformation of classical music in the 1900's, but fully modernized with an even larger palette, this album tries to do what pioneering artists like Schoenberg, Cage, and Eno were doing then, not aversely changing everything, but doing things in slightly esoteric ways. After the press reviews and eventual release, people will start changing their minds about NIN again. And that is because all great artists are dynamic, and those who pigeon hole people like Trent deserve to get that slap in the face, though, they can still hate and fill their life with super indie SH**, this is the record that set the benchmark. I feel that the music is alive in the artist here, and very well recorded, mixed, and mastered. There is no way a site like Pitchfork should be giving this anything below a 9, and we shall see about that soon......... and we have a 5.0!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYes! the reviewer is obviously a syntactical genius who obviously knows NIN by heart, just read the review folkie, there need be NO CONvincing.\n\nI fully award this work five stars for the 1 free side alone. Terrific setup and expert presentation for all the various packages laid out perfectly on NIN's website. A great surprise. A better foundation.\n\nP.S. I will now actually go listen to the album. Trent, Trent, can I leave now? (weeping)","classification":5}

{"text":"Talk about a surprise of promo single styling! Rihanna 'goes against the grain' on her promo single \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Diamonds\/dp\/B009L5EOCU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Diamonds<\/a>\" stepping 'back' as opposed to keeping in sync with her recent modern-pop vein. Rather than making the focus the production, \"Diamonds\" focuses on Rihanna's voice moreso than the underpinnings, something that might not have been said about \"We Found Love\" (2011's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Talk-That-Talk\/dp\/B005TZFZJC\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Talk That Talk<\/a>)  Rihanna has released songs similar to \"Diamonds\" as singles that have been quite effective including \"You Da One\" (Talk That Talk), \"Russian Roulette\" (Rated R) and going back even further \"Unfaithful\" (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/A-Girl-Like-Me\/dp\/B000EQ4G5K\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">A Girl Like Me<\/a>).\n\nUpon first hearing \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Diamonds\/dp\/B009L5EOCU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Diamonds<\/a>,\" I found it to be an easy number to write off.  The reason being is that it seemed quite 'reserved' for an artists who exudes a huge artistic persona.  Successive listens have unveiled more of the subtle charm of \"Diamonds,\" making Rihanna's more restrained move possibly smarter than initially anticipated.  Vocally Rihanna does hold her own including enough gimmickry so that the listener can latch onto the listening adventure (\"Shine bright like a diamond...\" is constantly iterated and reiterated).  Verdict: Rihanna probably has another hit on her hands.  The Question: Can  \"Diamonds\" reach no. 1 on the pop charts? It's already done so on the R&B\/Hip-hop Songs.  Time will tell. It gets my blessing.","classification":4}

{"text":"Well after all the buzz, I expected something new, fresh, different and exciting.  But what I experienced was a instant replay of the Motown sound and on the first tune of what sounded like Dancing in the streets for the musical support for the song Rehab.  As I continued to listen, I encountered much of the same sounds and lyrics that emulate the sounds and bite off of the song title \"Me & Mrs. Jones, Billy Paul from back in the day.  Later in the CD, I could have sworn I heard the music from 60's Supreme Diva's \"Baby Love\".  Now wait just one minute, I thought what is this? and before I knew it the CD had ended, just as fast as it began.  Like getting to the creshindo and letting the song drop.  But now as I look at the reviews I think the fasination is the fact that this British, artist is mimicing the Black Motown era experience to some level of their expectations, of course I grimaced.  You see some people just don't get it but if you really want to hear a current artist who has truly created the essence of an old school generation you should listen to Chrisette Michelle, who really bring the best of lessons taught by Ella, Billie, Aretha, and Natalie.  And most importantly she brings her own unique style and music along the way.  I didn't see any mention or credits given to any of those artist that Amy mimics which it a bigger DISGRACE.  To add insult to injury she named this \"Back to Black\".  Rehab is what your Daddy should advise. Lastly the reference some reviewer made to Erykah Badu,LISTEN UP.... THERE IS NO COMPARISON.

{"text":"There comes a time when musical humor grows tiresome. After 30 years of making humorous albums TMBG just seem to spin their wheels now. Don't get me wrong, I like them, have all of their albums, but it's just not the same anymore. They're not fresh anymore. I hardly pay attention now, and that's something I used to do with \"Lincoln\", \"Flood\" and \"Apollo 18\". Heck, even \"Mink Car\". And, sure, \"Nanobots\" was pretty good, a strong turn around, but overall, since 2001's \"Mink Car\", the guys have felt stale. They need something new. You know, Franz Ferdinand collaborated with Sparks last year to great effect. It was completely unexpected, and strangely, it worked very well. Perhaps that's what TMBG need. To collaborate with an unusual artist that we fans would never suspect. You know it would be interesting. More interesting than \"Phone Power\".\n\n\"Phone Power\" is yet another collection of oddballs, this time from dial-a-song, but it just falls flat. It's just okay, nothing more. I used to get excited about TMBG. I used to want to memorize their quirky lyrics, but now, not so much. They need a kick in the pants. Stop doing children's music, you've diluted your effectiveness. Collaborate. Yes, collaboration is now called for. You've exhausted everything else.\n\nHere's how \"Phone Power\" compares to previous TMBG works:\n\n1986 They Might Be Giants: Four Stars\n1988 Lincoln: Four and a Half Stars\n1990 Flood: Five Stars\n1992 Apollo 18: Four Stars\n1994 John Henry: Two and a Half Stars\n1996 Factory Showroom: Three and a Half Stars\n1999 Long Tall Weekend: Three and a Half Stars\n2001 Mink Car: Four Stars\n2002 No!: Four Stars\n2004 The Spine: Three Stars\n2005 Here Comes The ABC's: Four Stars\n2007 The Else: Three and a Half Stars\n2008 Here Comes The 123's: Three Stars\n2009 Here Comes Science: Four Stars\n2011 Join Us: Three Stars\n2013 Nanobots: Four Stars\n2015 Glean: Three Stars\n2015 Why?: Three Stars\n2016 Phone Power: Three Stars","classification":3}

I was actually mad when I heard that some critics claimed that his debut, 2010's Doo - Wops & Hooligans was all over the place and he didn't have a consistent sound. I think that's a strength! Why can't they just appreciate that it was eclectic and great? I mean all of the songs worked and had that Bruno flair. \"Locked Out Of Heaven\" could have fit on the album nicely. Like I said it kinda has a pop feel with occasional dance touches but it definitely has classic rock attributes too in the simple guitar work. I really do care a lot about this track and think it's pretty damn good. I truly look forward to his second effort as it will probably be his first work that I get. I plan to get his debut too because that was just quality music. Shine on, Bruno!\n\n4.4 stars.","classification":4}

{"text":"Whether he's fronting Gov't Mule, playing with the Allman Brothers or the Dead, or sitting in with the innumerable bands he has collaborated live with over the last twenty plus years, Warren Haynes has shown time and time again that he has ability to enter almost any musical situation and create something wonderful. His recording career has focused almost solely on the electric side of his playing, but as he has shown at many festivals and on his Live at Bonaroo album, Haynes is no slouch with the acoustic guitar. The batch of songs he put together for his latest recording, Ashes and Dust, are more in the \"singer\/songwriter\" vein than the \"crank up the Les Paul\" vein, and Haynes finds himself right at home telling stories accompanied by an acoustic guitar. One of the complaints I always had with Haynes' solo acoustic work was that, even though it was well done, it sounded as though there was something missing. That \"something\" it turns out was a group of equally talented musicians to accompany him. For the job of accompanying Haynes on Ashes and Dust, he chose Railroad Earth and the results are second to none. Railroad Earth are every bit as talented on their respective instruments as Haynes is on the guitar, and the results of the collaboration are as warm and inviting as anything that has come before. The songs are beautiful, the playing is top notch, and I have no doubt Ashes and Dust will bring Haynes and Co. numerous accolades. Highly recommended.","classification":5}

{"text":"Lest we forget, Andy Williams was a major force in American popular music for nearly two decades. From 1956 through 1974, he placed over 40 singles on Billboard's Hot 100 Singles chart. Eight of these tunes made their way into the Billboard Top Ten. During those same years, Williams was a dominent force on the Album charts as well. He placed nearly 30 albums in the Top 100 and many of these albums remained on the charts for a year or more! Andy Williams was also the host of his own highly rated variety show on NBC for nearly a decade. You might be surprised to learn that \"Moon River\" was never released as a single. Rather it appeared on Williams' phenomenally successful 1962 album \"Moon River and Other Great Movie Themes\" which remained on the Billboard Album charts for an amazing 176 weeks. \"Moon River\" would become Andy William's signature tune. He sang the first few bars of the song each week to open his TV show and decades later would name his theater in Branson, MO after it. Here's to one of the greatest and most popular \"easy listening\" recordings of all-time!","classification":5}

{"text":"Hard to believe it, that singers of today have been more like jokes than the soul from the heart of the inside. But honestly, there are some singers from years ago that really have not been able to be ageless, and their songs have shown that they are never sounding tired or annoying as products, but soulful people. Sting is one of those singers that has shown to be completely ageless. When he was a part of The Police, he had some great songs with the group. But since he started his solo career on his own in the 80's, he has still shown brilliant growth in his songwriting. I think that is why his songs have never gotten out of date, they have instead been better with age like a fine glass of wine. One of my favorite songs of his from Nothing Like The Sun is fragile. The song is so intimate from the soul and sincerely cathartic at the guitar chords. It is one of those songs that has not been beautiful, but sincerely deep at the heart. I love how simple and beautiful the song is, and all this time never gotten old. This song is worth downloading from start to finish, from a fragile and beautiful soul.\n\nSong: A","classification":5}

{"text":"I've never been a fan of Disturbed. From the first time I heard David Draiman say muahahah in the radio hit song \"Down With the Sickness,\" I have not found a Disturbed track that didn't sound cheesy, for lack of a better word. That is why I was so surprised to find out that Draiman is the voice behind Device. I listened to the clips of the songs on Amazon before I read the reviews, so I was already interested in the music before the relation to Disturbed could turn me off. Speaking of the music, it is very heavy. Some reviewers have commented on the industrial aspects of the album, but any similarities between true industrial and Device end at the processed drums and guitars and a few synth noises. If you told a fan of KMFDM that Device was industrial, they would probably laugh at you. Of course, I don't care for KMFDM or true industrial, so Device's industrial-lite metal is okay with me. I was initially drawn to the album by the album's heaviness and Draiman's voice. Without knowing who was singing, I thought the singer was topnotch. Now that I own the album and know that the singer is David Draiman of Disturbed, I am going to go back and give Disturbed's catalog another listen. I do have one issue with what I consider an otherwise great album. Sadly, Device is seriously lacking in guitar leads. In place of leads, Draiman has inserted a number of melodic bridges into the songs. I'm not sure why he chose not to include leads in his songs; they would only have added to the music, but perhaps, being a singer, he saw the parts of the songs where leads would normally be as an opportunity to highlight his vocal abilities. All in all, the album is an enjoyable listen. I would recommend it to fans of all kinds of heavy music from Sevendust and Drowning Pool to Soilwork and Scar Symmetry.","classification":4}

{"text":"Adventures in the land of vinyl: you are always headed for some kind of surprise. First this is a DBL Lp (not a single LP as stated by amazon) and it's really nice to hear Browne's great songs 2-3 of them per side, but the bigger surprise is that the cover opens to the right side and not the left (actually like if it was an LP of an Israeli singer and the cover written in Hebrew). Is this a mistake? A gimmick? who knows....\n\nAs for the music I agree that this is the best effort by Browne since the early 80's and the production is very classy. The songs are well constructed, but that's something Browne always do well, he is the master of the genre. And talking of masters I felt that this album sounded a lot like one of his brilliant alumnis: John Gorka. So it's a full circle now, Browne has learned from the one he teached.\n\nI am sure he could write a song about it.\n\nEnjoy, there is a lot to enjoy here.","classification":4}

{"text":"I will try to keep this simple since there are a lot of long reviews here and I want to approach the review a little differently.\n\nI generally write long detailed reviews of albums and try to embed a historical or relatable FYI around the prognosis, usually because as I rebuild my classic rock collection from vinyl to CD, a project which is quite daunting itself, I find myself taking a long second look at music that was key in my early years.  College kids in the early to mid 70's were (and still are today, I believe) very experimental and willing to subscribe to investigating and investing in their music.  The era and genre we now call progressive rock was full to brim with every fusion you could think of.  Miles Davis was gone electric and psychedelic and funk, other jazz stalwarts were taking their instruments not only into prog-rock fusion, but exploring Indian musical notation, and even dissonant cacophonies that required rapt attention.\n\nIn the midst of all this, Yes, ELP, and Renaissance (initially) were fusing classical styles to their folk and\/or rock experiments.  Many other acts would tumble out of this particular Yahtzee cup.  Actually, precursors to this movement were The Moody Blues and Electric Light Orchestra, as well as King Crimson, The Nice, and others who produced the superstars of Prog Rock.  Oh yeah, and enough of other reviewers like to lump Genesis into this stew as well, though I don't quite see Genesis as fusing classical music into the mix as much as Old English folk and drama.  Yes actually drew from multiple wells: Classical, Folk, Jazz, and a few other spices.\n\nLike most fans, I came to Yes with FRAGILE strictly through the dormitory hallways of early 1972.  By the fall of the same year CLOSE TO THE EDGE had everyone with intellectual curiosity going Ga Ga and it was decided this was some sort of masterpiece.  Well, several decades later I have to admit that it was and still is.  There is really nothing like at all.  Except for maybe... TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS.  After initial exposure, more than a few of us back tracked to THE YES ALBUM and TIME & A WORD and maybe even YES.  You could track the natural progression of a group that was steadily moving from a post-psychedelic brandishing towards a sophisticated philosophical introspection and even science fiction story boarding.  Those first three albums are, well...surprisingly good.  But with the personnel changes that resulted in the FRAGILE\/CTTE crew, they very nearly achieved a godhead in musical talent that was at once cohesive and individual.  I honestly do not believe Wakeman would have had the success he did with Six Wives Of Henry VIII and Journey To The Center Of The Earth if it had not been for his name recognition in association with Yes.\n\nCLOSE TO THE EDGE was vast, incredibly epic in a tapestry of sonic perfection which cannot be put adequately into human words.  As thoughtful as the poetic lyricism and musical explosiveness is, it evades description other than to call it a work of art.  So between 1972 and 1974 Yes travelled the world on the crest of a wave doing concerts on a rotating stage with Roger Dean landscapes and pastel laser lightshows, captured effectively on the three LP monster live album YESSONGS.\n\nIn the meantime, Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, and Steve Howe, and whole lotta college kids like myself were reading The Autobiography Of A Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda (Santana, McLaughlin, and a host of others were getting into Self Realization which of course motivated fans).  The same Shastric Scriptures of Hinduism which perked up our curiousity were capturing the artistic leanings of Anderson.  The project then became monumental:  shruti, smriti, purana, and tantra.  The shrutis are the revealed scriptures, the Vedas (The Revealing Science Of God).  The smritis or remembered lore was written down in a remote past as the world's longest epic poems, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana (The Remembering).  Puranas are ancient allegories (The Ancient); tantras rites or rituals we use to remember and to teach.  This then became the ambition of Yes.  Unfortunately Bill Bruford had had enough of this kind of religiosity in the music and turned his drum set over to Alan White.  Bad timing since percussion solos were in the offing here, and Alan, capable enough, could not match what Bruford would have done with it.  Wakeman thankfully held on through this effort until the end and we have some incredible textures painted by him.\n\nTALES requires a dedicated Yes fan, a musicologist philosopher, or an attentive youth with a bent towards free form art who can appreciate what has been created here.  This is CLOSE TO THE EDGE taken to the precipice of The Edge.  Your choice to drop or just look.  It is a beautiful work.  It has moments of sheer profundity both musically and lyrically.  It also grows on you with time.  I did not like it as much in 1974 as I do now.  CTTE was instant.  TALES took some time.  I now consider them near equals in ambition and scope.  These two albums are the pinnacle of what Yes would ever achieve.  I do like later albums, some more than others, even some of the new things, but FRAGILE, CTTE, & TALES are a triumvirate of progressive rock perfection.\n\nA final thought.  One of the landmarks of classic Yes is the stream-of-consciousness philological writing style which Anderson employed in lyrics from Fragile through Relayer.  His poetry requires study to get every meaning and intent out of it.  This then was a sign of the uniqueness of Yes that combined with the classical and avant garde fusion jazz weavings of their music.  To be true, they were \"progressive\" before this, and certainly after this, but what most people call \"classic\" Yes is the pinnacle of their art found here on three albums that are indeed pinnacles of the entire movement.  They deserve to be held in the same regard with Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, ELP's Pictures At An Exhibition and Trilogy, and in my mind the Pangea\/Panthalassa releases of Miles.  This is high art for both student and audiophile.  If you are looking for easy pop tunes, it is far and away from here.\n\nSome notes on what follows (if you are interested):\n\nRELAYER followed 11 months later.  RELAYER and I never got along very well, it had it's moments but it seemed like Mahavishnu Orchestra on steroids and other than To Be Over, the twinkle seemed to have gone out (for a moment) of Yes.  Patrick Moraz was an \"adequate\" replacement for Wakeman and did his job okay, but I think that Anderson and Howe made an epic war film here and it didn't fit into the mold of what I wanted from Yes.\n\nOLIAS OF SUNHILLOW, a solo project by Anderson released a year after RELAYER was more of a return to the classic Yes sound, beautiful, epic in scope, with a sonic brilliance which belonged in the Yes catalogue.\n\nGOING FOR THE ONE a year after that ('77) returned Wakeman to the fold and other than the title track (simply awful) the album has shining moments and some great songs, including Parallels by Chris Squire, a bassists dream of songwriting perfection.\n\nAfter this, Yes begins to mutate into something which eventually becomes a composite of Yes and The Buggles which produces an actually terrific pop album called 90125 after a debacle called DRAMA.  The next best stop to make is ANDERSON BRUFORD WAKEMAN HOWE a non-Yes Yes project which for all purposes is Yes during some legal wrestling with Buggles aligned Yes mates or rather the execs at the label.  REUNION is also a solid late entry that combines literally all of the Yes factions into somewhat a cohesive whole.  The \"adult oriented pop\" of the recent HEAVEN & EARTH with a Jon Anderson sound-alike sent tremors through me.  It took great will and a fans heart to try it out and find that it was all that bad.  Just NOT YES as far from Yes as one could imagine.","classification":5}

{"text":"Being a massive fan of The Bangles' music since the early '80s, \"Doll Revolution\" was a long time coming for me, especially after the \"Behind the Music\" episode on them. I have been waiting for this cd for two years, let alone the past decade for new music from them in general. Now that I have the cd in my hands, it was so well worth the money and wait for the cd to arrive in my mailbox. \"Doll Revolution\" did not fail to disappoint me. There really isn't an artist or band that harmonizes as well as The Bangles do. \"Doll Revolution\" is a great reminder how well Susanna, Vicky, Debbi, and Michael's vocals sounds together. \"Mixed Messages\" is a great example the band's abilities to harmonize. On the VH1's \"Behind the Music\" episode on The Bangles, at the end the viewer was introduced to a sampling of \"Ride the Ride\" and \"Lost At Sea\" which are found on the cd, much to my delight. Overall, \"Doll Revolution\" is a mixture of \"All Over the Place\" and \"Everything\", the raw production of \"All Over the Place\" with the sweet melodies of \"Everything\". The best of both worlds if anything. Susanna, Vicky, Debbi, and Michael all sound as if the band never broke up in the late '80s. I loved every single song on the album.

{"text":"Powerful, Pensive, Suspenseful, and Heroic.  Tyler Bates has done a great job with this music, and it evokes many different feelings as you listen to it.  The opening track is full of that suspenseful feeling, like a knight searching for the Holy Grail.  Obviously, I have not see the film yet, but I love to listen to the music before I go see the movie which lets your imagination run wild.  Track 2 starts out with that pensive feeling, like a detective trying to crack a case, searching for clues; it then starts to build with a pulsing beat, and then the heroic theme gets its first introduction.  I love his use of percussion, drums, horns, vocals and the anvil.  Track 2 ends in a fanfare-like way with trumpets blaring.  Track 3 could be used for the opening of a western gunfight, where the hero is searching for the bad guy.  Track 4 has the anvil back in accenting fashion, and it makes me think of a space battle with ships firing on each other and then escaping.  I love the change of moods in Track 5 with the violins, the vocals, and the main theme being played on the piano.  It is a tender, heartfelt piece that feels meditative, somewhat sad, but it builds with a determination that the quest will go on.  Music can touch the heart in so many ways, bypassing words, and hitting the heart.  I will not try to review all the tracks, but each one is unique, evoking different feelings and moods that bring different picture to your mind.  I like to ask the question, \"what other movie, or other characters in a movie, could this music be used for?  Track 13 brings to my mind an epic Star Wars Jedi fight scene, with different Jedi and Sith battling it out first on a strange planet, but then they reach their fighters, and take the battle into space.  Track 19 could be retitled, \"The Game Is Afoot,\" since is starts out with that pensive, suspenseful feel.  Sherlock is chasing the criminal through the streets of London, and half-way through the track when it changes to that driving beat, the criminal has jumped on a train and they begin to battle on the train.  Track 20 is hard to describe, but I love it.  It starts out slow and the expands, it makes you feel like you are floating on the pulsing beat.  It is called, Sacrifice, and it has a sacred feel to it, like one of them will have to sacrifice themselves to save the others.  Track 29 also has that sacred quality about it, as if the knights have found the Holy Grail and the heavens are opening up, bringing God's blessings to Arthur and his land once more.  Lastly, the last Track make you feel everything is right with the world.  Written in that major key, everything turns out okay and is resolved, at least musically.  He then has some fun playing the theme to plucky strings, letting you know friendships have been made and sealed for life, and the Galaxy is safe, for now.  Enjoy.","classification":5}

In fact, mostly all of the covers that the cast of Glee had done were terrible. For Lea Michele, she has a lot to prove to get past the sense of what Glee has shown musically in lackluster covers. Yet, she also has had a lot to prove in herself too, not just that she can sing, but getting past dealing with the death of Cory Montiff who passed away last year from his personal vices. Cannonball, Lea's debut single from her upcoming album Louder isn't a bad song. She shows a really strong voice and soul, but there could've been more to shine from the song itself.

While people have finally discovered her more than just a singer with being one of the new judges for American Idol this year, she sadly hasn't been able to deliver strongly with her music. Her latest single On The Floor, isn't really a driven dance song. It actually felt less than stellar compared to her On The 6 days when she became a songstress whom had crossed beyond the boundaries. Following her dissapointing singles Louboutons & Fresh Out The Oven from her cancelled Love record which was suppose to be released last year but fell through the cracks with being dropped with Sony, she really has lost her shine in great music. I think Jennifer needs to try a different rout with her voice. Hopefully, she can come back with a better single to call her own the next time around. Anyway, Jenny form the block, good luck with American Idol. You're gonna need it!\n\nSong: D","classification":2}

{"text":"Here is yet another great set from Bach Guild. I'm now about halfway through it, and the highlight so far is a fabulous performance of Gluck's \"Orfeo e Euridice.\" Maureen Forrester, the greatest contralto of her generation, is downright awesome as Orfeo. I don't think she ever sang any better than this. Teresa Stich-Randall is fine, as ever, as Euridice, and the young Charles Mackerras wields a supportive and sensitive baton as he conducts Bach Guild's standby Vienna State Opera Orchestra. This performance alone is more than worth your 99 cents. Check out the reviews of the earlier CD release here, where it's selling from 3rd parties for $39.99:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Gluck-Orfeo-Euridice\/dp\/B0000023D4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gluck: Orfeo & Euridice<\/a>. Now admittedly, Gluck's Orfeo is not a baroque choral work, but I'm not complaining!\nAnother favorite is the Pergolesi Stabat Mater--I started with this because I like the soprano, Stich-Randall, and mezzo Elizabeth Hngen. The recording also features Anton Heiller on organ and Mario Rossi conducting the VSOO. It's gorgeous!\nI've also enjoyed the Vivaldi Dixit Dominus (Vivaldi could really write for voices as well as he could write for fiddles) and John Blow's impassioned \"Ode on the Death of Henry Purcell\". Blow had been Purcell's teacher and sponsor and so this work is especially personal. Also lovely is Charpentier's Magnificat--a graceful and melodius setting.\nI haven't hit a bad performance yet, and I'm looking forward to exploring further.\nUnless I've missed something, there are no duplicates with previous Bach Guild releases, which is a bit of a feat in itself, given how much music Bach Guild has given us in the past few years.","classification":5}

{"text":"If you have been sitting on pins and needles for 4 months or longer, ever since word broke that a new Pink Floyd was forthcoming in November, then you have probably preordered this album as I did, and this review will be moot to you.  For everyone else, you may have read much about this album already from various music news sources.  To say that a new Pink Floyd album was astounding news in 2014, a full 20 years after their last studio album!  For all anyone knew, there would never be another, so consequently, it looks like hell has frozen over again.  And for anyone who doesn't know but thought to ask the question, no there is no Roger Waters on this album.  Essentially, this is more of a tribute to Richard Wright, whose keyboard compositions, some 20 hours of unused recordings, from that time long ago (and even some from further back) have formed the backbone of this album, THE ENDLESS RIVER.  Wright passed in 2008, and left a body of unused Pink Floyd works dating back as far as 1969, and according to Polly Samson, David Gilmour's wife and lyrics contributor, this album is Richard's \"swansong\".  12 of these tracks are credited to him as writer or co-writer.\n\nThe music bemoans the best sounds from The Division Bell and Wish You Were Here.  I choose those two as analogous due to the overarching \"feeling\" and mood which is present on much of the work.  The classic Gilmour guitar, an ever present and distinctive wail of bluesy rock, has been and is the signature of almost all Pink Floyd albums, and here it sings, along with Richard's keys, again.  THE ENDLESS RIVER is another spectacle in the PF catalogue, and though there are those who decry the group's separation from Waters, the overall majority of fans still love that sound.  This most likely will be the last we hear from Floyd, though it would be nice if there is another planetary visitation in our near future.\n\nI think the best way to approach this album is by pleasant surprise, with no spoilers, so I will not even attempt to describe or perform \"analysis\" review of the album tracks.  Let the music take you away, down the endless river for which it is named.  You know what to expect from Pink Floyd and you will not be disappointed at all by this album.  In fact, I think any real Floyd Fan will be instantly and deeply enamored with it.  After I listen a few more times than just once through, I may update this review, but the bottom line is this:  THE ENDLESS RIVER is nothing short of what one would expect from the premier flagship of progressive space rock that has sailed through our lives with us.  It is beautiful, it is engaging, it is a perfect ending for the group if this is indeed the ending of studio recordings.  If you wish to revisit the Pink Floyd sound which was definitive before THE WALL, then this album will act as an elegy to Pink Floyd for the feverish fan.  There is much to be desired here, musically, if you are engrossed by the Pink Floyd \"sound\" across the decades from SAUCER through DIVISION BELL, especially drawing from a sonic landscape of MEDDLE, DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, WISH YOU WERE HERE, and melded ever so delicately with DIVISION BELL instrumentals.  It is the perfect union of a classic Pink Floyd exploration and their final voyage.\n\n[Last lines sung on a Pink Floyd studio album prior to this:  \"the endless river...forever and ever...\"]  In keeping with the \"high hopes\" of that line, THE ENDLESS RIVER augments the positive notes of Pink Floyd's final legacy.  Pink Floyd were not known for shiny lustrous positivity in their music (\"as a matter of fact it is ALL dark!\") so for their last rites, at least with Gilmour at the reins, Pink Floyd first encouraged us to \"keep talking\" and move the capacity for humanity on down the line in time, and have now set forth a musical beauty of rapturous creativity within the bounds of the endless river.\n\nThe Worm Ouroboros is a serpent which eats its own tail, thus forming and endless infinite circle.  THE ENDLESS RIVER is both an organic extension of THE DIVISION BELL where the concept left off with High Hopes and an organic return to the sonic SAUCERFUL OF SECRETS where Gilmour began with Pink Floyd and where Richard Wright began to write more complex material.  Thus, THE ENDLESS RIVER is Ouroboros, forming an infinite loop of Pink Floyd music across 45 years.  At least, that is the way I see it.  Now see what YOU think!\n\nI can't help myself, one small wonderful tidbit:  Talkin' Hawkin' once again gives us another terrific track featuring Stephen Hawking computerized vocals (as if you hadn't already figured that out simply from the track title).\n\nSound engineering and mastering:  pristine as always with every Pink Floyd album.  Surround Sound Bluray: utterly and inescapably fantastic, play this on your PS3 through your stereo system and be prepared to journey into the netherworld.  It is way too bad that no one has done this with DARK SIDE OF THE MOON or WISH YOU WERE HERE yet.  Maybe someday, before the original masters fade away, they will figure out how to simulate this kind of separation from those tapes.\n\nOn first listen this a Perfect 10.  For Amazon Reviews, 5 Stars plus a Crazy Diamond!\n\nUPDATE 11\/17\/2014\nAfter almost a full week of listening to this album, for the prospective buyer very familiar with the Pink Floyd catalogue:\nThis album revisits the past and integrates that past into the modern Pink Floyd sound so well that it truly IS an endless river.  If you have noted the number of tracks and even the record album related layout of those tracks in their identity, first and foremost, this is a whole piece epic and not a \"song oriented\" album, not that Pink Floyd ever were, but like Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells albums, or Tangerine Dream albums, THE ENDLESS RIVER is one huge piece that must be listened to from start to finish to be fully appreciated.  You will hear friendly and familiar integrations of near- or alternative- pieces of Astronomy Domine, A Saucerful Of Secrets, and if you listen carefully you might even catch some of the sounds from Mason's The Grand Vizier's Garden Party mashed in there, all from '69 era UMMAGUMMA works.  There is even some ambient and synthesizer pieces that are obvious from ANIMALS tracks in progress.  Track 2 on this album imbues some alternative but obvious workings from Shine On You Crazy Diamond and near the end of the album, again if you listen very carefully, you can catch drum work and down-blast guitar allusions to the opening of Time.  Even Wright's jazzy keyboard improvisations and nod to his Summer '68 composition are evident.  Gilmour's own guitar work runs the cycles as well from the astounding space effects of UMMAGUMMA to the atmospheric sliding of DIVISION BELL take us on a grand tour.  Some Floyd \"fans\" are doubtless not going to like this album, will consider it either rehash, unoriginal, or will continue the hate on Roger Waters' missing in action.  But for the fan who has followed this trail from '68 (Gilmour aboard and Barrett bowing out) to '95 (PULSE)with love and dedication, then this album is a must have.  The music is beautiful, exploratory, and reminiscing.  'Nuff said.","classification":5}
{"text":"This is indeed a beautiful album.  It opens with the traditional \"In the Bleak Midwinter\" and then goes directly into the classic \"Christmas Time Is Here\" from \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\".  Another traditional but seldom heard number is \"Rocking\", and then there's the haunting lullaby, \"All Through The Night\".  \"Silent Night\" is the one absolute Christmas standard here.  And \"Close Your Eyes\", Brahms Lullaby, is heard from time to time on Christmas CDs, though it isn't truly a Christmas song.  However, with Shawn's voice, all of these are good.\nRegretfully, I can't put this album into the same category that I have put CDs by other female vocalists such as Judy Collins, Natalie Cole, Anne Murray, or Julie Andrews.

It may well be the pinnacle of his calypso songs.  Last Mango In Paris is often forgotten, but essential Jimmy Buffett album.","classification":5}

{"text":"Has an intro ever sounded so autumnally heavy as the opening 0:30 on Ten Years Gone? It has that 'getting darker earlier' feel to it - leaves blanket the ground, the sunlight slants create strange hues, and there's a chill in the air.\n\nRobert Plant tells of a woman he was in love with ten years ago (so 1965-ish?), a few years before Led Zeppelin formed. She gave him an ultimatum: her or the music. Jimmy Page patched the musical ideas together. The song goes through a number of variations. After the first 0:30, a second part comes in with a descending chord sequence, like A-G-D-Dm. The intro sequence then comes back in at 1:01 and Robert waxes nostalgic starting at 1:16:\n\nThen as it was, then again it will be\nAnd though the course may change sometimes\nRivers always reach the sea\n\nJohn Bonham thunders in at 1:34...building on to the repeated second part of the intro, and we continue along into the next verse.\n\nAt 2:30 we head into the middle section. Jimmy's guitar rises up out of the mist and it's like the sun has come out and everything sparkles and shines. Robert gains strength from this and expresses his bitter feelings of regret:\n\nDid you ever really need somebody\nAnd really need 'em bad\n\nAt 3:47 Jimmy leads us across a field and we head back in among the trees at 4:10. Now, though, the sun filters down through the branches and Robert remarks that even though much time has passed\n\nWe are eagles of one nest\nThe nest is in our soul\n\nThere will always be a special bond that they shared. At 5:03, Robert turns reflective again; the face of his lost love still appears in his dreams. He cries out at the end that the memories are still there. He still cherishes them, holdin' on, ten years gone. The music surrounds and comforts him like protective spirits.","classification":5}

{"text":"This is not the cacophonous circus that two big bands playing together (for the first time, without rehearsal, and in one 12-hour session) might have become.  Think of it as one large ensemble (like Kenton's 40+ piece mellophone orchestra) commanded by a first captain (Ellington) and two assistant directors (Basie and Strayhorn).  Basie, the spokesperson for understatement, and Ellington, the supreme creator of small ensembles within larger ensembles: the result is sensible, swinging, and frequently exhilarating music--with enough spontaneity to satisfy even a Charles Mingus.\n\nIn fact, Mingus was the only musician the ultra permissive Ellington ever fired from his band--at the insistence of Juan Tizol, after the volatile bassman had come at the trombonist with a fire ax.  On the occasion of this recording, Tizol again insisted that Ellington fire someone--trumpeter Cat Anderson, who had nearly sliced off his head with a spiraling Sam Woodyard cymbal. \" It's him or me,\" said Juan.  Ellington may have been agreeable, but the Maestro was not about to submit to an ultimatum issued in public by his trombonist.  So \"First Time\" was the last time for Juan Tizol.\n\nMusical highlights include some heated exchanges between the two bands' top soloists, especially Thad Jones vs. Cat Anderson, and Frank Foster + Frank Wess vs. Paul Gonsalves (who could hold his own in any company).  Also, Wess' flute (an instrument that didn't interest Ellington) and Jimmy Hamilton's clarinet do a memorable \"pas de deux.\"  At the same time, not bringing together the lead altoists--Johnny Hodges and Marshall Royal--is a wasted opportunity.  On the whole, the affair favors Basie over Ellington, whose subtle, nuanced palette and sophisticated compositional genius are less apparent than usual.  The Freddie Green rhythm guitar would all but clinch it as a primarily Basie date were it not for the rich percussive colors and personal back-beat (as opposed to Sonny Payne's broader stroke) of Sam Woodyard.\n\nA minor disappointment is the audio on this 2008 edition.  There's some breaking up of the sound during the climactic ensemble passages of the main burner, \"Battle Royal.\"  Perhaps mine is a defective copy, because after the perfect sound of the digitalized and reissued \"Ellington at Newport 1956,\" a buyer would have the right to expect as much of a 1962 date.  Otherwise, the reissue presents complete tracks for the first time and adds 11 tracks to the 8 on the original album.  The notes are copious, informative, and frequently absorbing.\n\nLike the Ellington\/Coltrane meeting, this is not an Ellington essential, but then again it's one no fan of either member of the royal pair would want to be without.","classification":4}

{"text":"The Who's bass guitarist,John Entwistle, wrote this song and it is said to be his first song. Entwistle is said to have written it after an evening of drinking with Bill Wyman who was the bass player for the Rolling Stones. It is a comical story about a spider walking across a room who then ends up with an unfortunate fate. I won't spoil it here. Not surprisingly for a bass player composition, it has fine Bass notes and the guitar stays in the basement note-wise (Yeah, yeah, I know that bass player Paul McCartney is quite diverse in his writing). Entwistle's gravelly bass vocals greatly add to the impact of the song. Because this song is both fun and unusual, it should be included in any comprehensive Rock N' Roll collection.","classification":5}

{"text":"I backed into Justified through Elmore Leonard. Id read his original stories about U.S. Deputy Marshall Raylan Givens --the novel Riding the Rap and the short story Fire in the Hole --and then I received for review his late novel Raylan, which became virtually the boilerplate for one or two episodes on the television show.  When we started watching the show the first season while the fourth season was airingwe fell in love with it.\n\nOne of the reasons we loved it was the soundtrack, which is a mixture of country and western music, Appalachian blues, and modern day hip hop and rap. So I bought this album. Im glad I did, because its good.\n\nThe song everyone knows is the main title theme, Long Hard Times to Come, written and performed by Gangstagrass, who combine bluegrass, country blues and hip hop, and feature a changing cast of rappers (T.O.N.E.-Z on the title tune, R-Son on Gunslinging Rambler, which closes the album). Long Hard Times kicks the series episodes into action and sets mood and tone before the action ever comes.  Its not as good as Alabama 3s Woke Up This Morning for The Sopranos, but its not far behind in quality and the difference may be partly just that The Sopranos came first.\n\nTheres a lot of good music on the album. Beverley Stauntons cover of Stand By Your Man is as close as you can get to Tammy Wynettes original take on it. Lynda Kays two songs (Dream My Darling, Jack and Coke), Jesse Dayton and Brennen Leighs duet (We Lost It) fit comfortably in the same straight C&W groove. Bill Champlin and Steve Porcaro (Porcaro is music director for the show) perform a bluesish Devil at the Wheel.  The Cumberland River Bands Justified is updated bluegrass. (The lyrics to Justified are trite but the music is good.) Old-style country blues is represented by Robert Walsh (Southfield Blues) and the Homemade Jamz Blues Band (Hobo Man). The one cut I did not like is Ryan Kicklands In Trouble, but thats just my personal taste, and not to be taken as a judgment on it.\n\nThe best cuts on the album are two by rocker turned crossover performer Dave Alvin (think The Blasters, 1979): a slow sizzling blues, Harlan County Line, with Alvin talk-singing the lyrics over a driving bass-drum-guitar background, and Beautiful City Across the River, which is just something else. An added bonus: Alvins lyrics are the best in the album. Both of his songs are about restless men who drift from woman to woman but never find rest. Alvins presence on the album raises it from good (3, maybe 3-1\/2, stars out of 5) to exceptional (4 out of 5). So  little that is new on the album but two first rate cuts (Alvins) and many other good ones  over all, an enjoyable listening experience.","classification":4}

Ringo has never sounded better than with his take on a Buck Owens classic. George was starting to find his magic with clever tunes like, You Like me Too Much and I Need You. John was at the top of his game with self-deprecating lyrics and great vocal arrangements, and boy he sure sounds like Bob Dylan in the track, You've Got to Hide Your Love Away. And how could I forget about the Fab 4's biggest song, the poigant and bone-chilling ballad, Yesterday. Paul's vocals get right under your skin, what a genius he was.

The songs respectively are  \"Angel,\" \"Risingson,\" \"Teardrop,\" and \"Inertia Creeps\". \"Angel\" has a stark production featuring pointed beats and a distorted bassline that frames the vocal and a two-minute flame-out with raging guitars. \"Risingson\" is a dense, dark sounding song with a ton of dub throughout. \"Teardrop\" is an awesome song where they collabored with Elizabeth Fraser from Cocteau Twins. \"Inertia Creeps\" is a highlight with an atmospheric sound, fuzz-tone guitars, and a wealth of effects, the song could well be the best production from the best team of producers the electronic world had ever seen.

{"text":"Jordan Smith has a voice that is clear and powerful.  He has the ability to make well known songs his own with his voice.  He sings \"Over The Rainbow\" with a few words in the beginning that I have never heard of before.  He makes my heart feel at peace on this song.  Jordan delivers the most soulful cover of \"Amazing Grace\" I have ever heard.  There is a wisdom in Jordan's voice beyond his years.  This is evident on the song \"And So It Goes\". He makes me forget that Billy Joel originally did this song. \"Settle\" is a song that makes me feel empowered.  This song makes me believe that I deserve the best in life, and that I should not accept second best in  a relationship..\"Aint Got To Far To Go\" is a very uplifting song.  Jordan sounds like he has a choir backing him on this song. \"What Now\" is a song that makes me feel hopeful that my all aspects of my life will improve.  \"Beautiful Things\" and \"Stand In The Light\" are two songs that resonate me lyrically.  These two songs are a reminder for me to embrace everything and everyone in my life.  This is an entertaining debut album by Jordan Smith.","classification":5}

{"text":"I'll admit I didn't really jump on board when this album was released last year.  It's definitely a contender for Rapzilla.com's Album of the Year for 2013.  After my first listen I was amazed. He didn't copy the similar formula that many hip-hop artists have used since his emergence.  Talented Xth brings a unique articulation of content which is severely needed in the genre.  He doesn't pull any punches or mince his words, as described in the song Jim Crow.  Sho definitely brought his A-game his flow and wordplay is first rate.  I'm glad he didn't use auto-tune and 808 heavy tracks.  Stated plainly songs like Jim Crow sadly won't make the Top 5, or BET countdown but should.  It's content isn't as deplorable as some have suggested.  Personally, I would equate it, with watching the Roots saga.  You are going to have your feathers ruffled but, for good reason.  Addressing racism, and hypocrisy even in the industry circle with which he had close ties with  without name dropping is a tall order.  But, Sho pulls its off. I believe that once you listen with the intention of gaining insight and not dismissing it as a \"diss record\"  you will be pleasantly surprised.  I like how this album flows like a story book as opposed to a regular full length album with intros and outros.  Tracks like Michael, Exodus, Denzel,  Get Happy interlude, Me!, King,  Cliff and Claire display Sho and his featured guests creative flow and spiritual maturation. Ali is the motivational single that really lifts your spirit.  Hopefully, High Society and Hello Revolution will release another dope album.  Because the Lord has given Sho Baraka a gift that needs to be shared with the rest of the world.  I'm glad that he has taken the road less traveled even if it does get him ostracized.  Listen and listen well, go and be doers of the Word and not just hearers only.  Talented 10th gets the job accomplished.  Keep fighting and moving forward Sho!","classification":5}

{"text":"This has got to be one of the best classical deals around on Amazon's MP3 site. These excellent recordings of all Jean Sibelius' symphonies from the BIS label -- plus a generous selection of Sibelius' other orchestral greats -- all on sale for $7.99. If you compare this to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/the-CD-version-of-these-same-recordings\/dp\/B00005Q450\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">the CD version of these same recordings<\/a>, currently at over $50, or even to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/the-other-MP3-version-of-these-same-recordings\/dp\/B002WMK46E\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">the other MP3 version of these same recordings<\/a>&nbsp;released by BIS for $18, this is a tremendous bargain.\n\nBut wait -- there's more. The releases linked to above only contain symphonies 1-7 and \"Tapiola\" -- total run time 4:47. This release has all that plus the Overture in E Major, Finlandia, the Lemminkainen Suite, Valse Triste, the Violin Concerto, En Saga, the Karelia Suite and Snfrid. Total run time 7:27. Both sets even include two versions of Symphony No. 5 -- the original 1915 version, and the suped-up final version from 1919.\n\nMake no mistake, however -- this isn't just about bargain prices for a ton of music. Finland's Lahti Symphony Orchestra may not be a household name internationally, but they are justifiably renowned for their Sibelius. These are masterful performances by Sibelius specialists under their long-time conductor Osmo Vanska (now at the Minnesota Orchestra), who transformed this relatively small Finnish orchestra into a real Sibelius powerhouse.\n\nJust a note on the business side of things -- I was happy to see that the fantastic BIS label released this MP3 set itself. A lot of its recordings lately have been packaged by content provider X5 of Sweden, and it's a good feeling to hope that BIS might be getting just a bit larger share of the sales of these recordings in its own release.\n\nThe total download size is 683 MB. Bitrates are variable, averaging 204-237 kbps.\n\nJump on this one before they change their minds. Great Sibelius at a great price. Enthusiastically recommended.","classification":5}

{"text":"Someone may look at this and wonder why I'd be giving this cd 5 stars.  Well if you grew up with the Partridge Family music as I did then you know the happy memories and just pure fun the music provides.  I was in my early teens at the time of the Partridge Family, owned all the albums then and have them all on cd now.  But it is the holiday season when taking out this cd just makes all the great memories rush back and luckily I have those with me who love to share it and together we can make new memories.\n\nGranted it was only Shirley Jones and David Cassidy who really sang.  The rest were studio musicians and singers.  But call it bubble gum or pop, the chemistry worked.  This Christmas cd is pure hearfelt performances that bring the pleasures the holidays should.  From the original peppy opening MY CHRISTMAS CARD TO YOU and other feel good tracks like SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN, JINGLE BELLS, ROCKIN ROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE and SLEIGH RIDE to the slower WHITE CHRISTMAS, BLUE CHRISTMAS and HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS we get the perfect blend of David Cassidy's always great and reliable vocals mixed with the great Partridge sound.  There is no sound in music like the backup voices on a Partridge song and it is great fun.  And of course Shirley Jones get her solo turn on THE CHRISTMAS SONG.\n\nIf you grew up with the Partridges and their music you owe it to yourself to add this cd to your music collection.  It will bring such fun and joy to these special holidays.","classification":5}

{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW:\nThis review is similar to one I will write for a number of new albums and is essentially a statement.\n\nIt seems that more and more record labels are choosing NOT to include digital downloads with vinyl purchases which I think is absolutely unacceptable given that the cost of the album on vinyl is usually more than *double* that of a CD or straight digital download, and because recording a vinyl to digital format is a bit of a pain when compared to ripping a CD. I was happy years ago when more and more labels began offering digital downloads with the purchase of a record, but that seems to have changed with the popularity of vinyl again increasing steadily. When you factor in that the cost of vinyl has been increasing right along with that popularity with no added benefits other than the label receiving more money then I get angry. Of the past 4 albums I've purchased, 3 have not included a digital tracks from lables Shanachie Entertainment, Not Now Music, and even freaking RCA.\n\nMy apologies for the 2-star review, but this needs to change. Not Now Music should offer a digital download and I\"ll revise my review to reflect the album rather than what I did not receive. I'm just tired of this and will simply resort to streaming or pirating album releases that don't provide what has become expected and standard in the past decade, simple as that. If hosting and bandwidth resources are at the crux of these cutbacks then just include a simple paper-sleeved CD instead as some labels have done for quite a while. And, if that is still too much cost, forgo the \"fashionable\" heavy weight, double LP release for a simple, more cost-effective single LP release. Double LP, 120g albums are almost always unnecessary anyway and take up too much space on my shelf let alone having to flip the record twice as often.\n\nHere ends my rant. I'm not going to buy albums at these prices any longer if this is the direction we're heading. At double or TRIPLE the price of a CD, digital tracks are nothing but a courtesy. Period.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nNear Perfection - One of my favorite collections in any genre, from any artist. The 3 LP vinyl is gorgeous and masterfully done. Whoever rated this one star for not being a 'live' album should be banned from Amazon.","classification":2}

Featuring cousin Cherelle and former New Edition member Johnny Gill, the title Track to Pebble's sophomore album is a mix between a soft-rock love song and an R&B slow jam. I don't know if it's the stellar writing, the catchy melody, the angelic quality of the keyboard production, or a combination of everything, but the repetition of the words towards the end NEVER grow tired. That's a feat in itself. It's a far cry from Mercedes Boy and anything on her first album and a million times better than anything on her mid 90s album (what was that all about, anyway?).

This Nirvana EP by Sam Smith has him masterfully spilling out his heart on how he would proceed in certain romantic affarins. For instance, Safe With Me expressed his sentiment that he does not care about the romantic partners past and only cares about their time together.  It also appears to be a song where he is expressing that he only plans to keep the affair between the two of them.  Nirvana by Sam Smith seems to be a satisfying tune about how the casual hookup with a certain person gives him feelings of bliss and that he plans to enjoy their company even if it does not last for a lifetime.

{"text":"Millions of people adore Mumford & Sons, finding their sound to be much more than pleasant folksy tunes but rather something like a revelatory, deeply meaningful expression of passion.\n\nWhen I first heard M&S, I, too, found them revelatory. It was intensely refreshing to hear popular music that has soul--so much soul that they couldn't help but to project it at the tops of their lungs. It was a desperately needed reply to the current \"I don't care \/ we do what we want\" irreverent dance-pop glitz ethos.\n\nMany listens later, I see M&S differently. The music reliably invokes excitement but, in doing so, it finds no space for subtlety or understatement. Their roots are in Back Country bluegrass and folk -- genres that are all about stories -- but in M&S's music there are no stories. Rather, this album is a lot like U2's City of Blinding Light: Biblical imagery expressed in generic terms. A flailing attempt to capture spirituality. Or maybe just to prevent boredom. Instead of stories intended to shake and inspire, we get posturing and shouting intended to excite. After a while, all the excitement becomes exhausting and empty, not unlike the dance-pop glitz they oppose.\n\nI believe people are starved for deeper rewards than Maroon 5 and their dance-pop contemporaries offer, and I believe that's why M&S are the top-selling musicians in the country (and by a wide margin), because they give the instant impression of heartfelt folky soulfulness. But the truth, revealed after enough listens, is that they are closer to stadium rock. To find deeper rewards, you have to look to the folk \/ bluegrass \/ celtic roots that have inspired them: Bob Dylan or Van Morrison, or even more recent acts like Ray LaMontagne or Amos Lee. Their music may not be as instantly pleasurable or exciting as M&S's, but if you give it your patience and attention, you just might find rewards that are far more precious than excitement.","classification":2}

{"text":"We Five released an excellent folk rock debut album with their \"You Were On My Mind.\" This was released and still available here on record album; it's also available as part of a two-fer CD You Were On My Mind \/ Make Someone Happy. Specifically, We Five consisted of Michael Stewart; Peter Fullerton; Beverly Bivens; Bob Jones and Jerry Burgan. Together these talented artists really made heads turn whenever their music was played or they performed in concert; and that's special. In addition, if you still have a turntable like I do, you can consider this on vinyl record album instead of CD--the sound is actually quite good!\n\n\"Love Me Not Tomorrow\" begins with Beverly Bivens singing wonderfully and the musical arrangement makes good use of the guitars and percussion--and those key changes between major and minor enhance the ballad, too! We Five performs \"Somewhere Beyond the Sea,\" a classic number, with panache and the faster tempo than I'm used to hearing for this tune actually work wonders for the song. \"My Favorite Things\" from \"The Sound of Music\" starts with a brief guitar musical intro and when they start singing this number really takes flight! They perform \"My Favorite Things\" very passionately. \"If I Were Alone\" is most memorable and We Five turns out a fine interpretation of \"Tonight\" from \"West Side Story.\" \"Cast Your Fate to the Winds\" is easy on the ear, too; I really like the way they perform this!\n\nOn side two of the album comes the title track, \"You Were On My Mind\" by Sylvia Tyson; this is a huge highlight of the record and they couldn't have done this any better! I love the way this sounds; what a great tune this is! We Five does a beautiful rendition of \"Can't Help Falling in Love;\" it's very, very sweet and \"Small World\" is brief but totally charming. Their rock and roll version of \"I Got Plenty O' Nuttin'\" really sounds great; as always this showcases their talent nicely. \"Softly As I Leave You\" charms me with its beauty and as always they never let go of a superfluous note and I'm very impressed. \"I Can Never Go Home Again\" ends the album with another poignant folk tune that I won't forget anytime soon.\n\nWe Five didn't stay together forever but what they shared with us is nothing short of wonderful. I highly recommend their music especially for people who appreciate 1960s folk rock and the work of the individual artists after the group disbanded.","classification":5}

{"text":"There is something about Adele. Something that grabs you, pulls you in hard and makes you feel. You live out every word. Every note. Every feeling as if they are your own. Like somehow she knew about the person that infected your soul and wouldn't let go. Or the one that got away. The one that broke your heart. The one whose heart you broke. It doesn't feel like I'm listening to her story, it's like she is telling mine.\n\nIt is rare that an artist can transcend genres and appeal to so many people. I know genre specific people, only listening to country, or rock, or metal, etc. They all adore Adele. A lot can be said about the greats of the past and how their music is untouchable. Adele is such an artist. She is timeless and is, hands down, one of the best artists to ever sing a note or write a lyric. Grand compliments sure but are they unfounded? Not with the power she has over people they aren't. I can't wait to play 25 in rotation for months on end just like I did 21. Welcome back, Adele!","classification":5}

Hard to believe it has been 20 years since the legendary Whitney Houston appeared in Waiting To Exhale, and the film honestly still sends shivers up my spine on the Terry McMillan adapted film. Whitney's music from the film after all these years still ignites beautifully from the heart with each and every note recorded. Her signature song, Exhale (Shoop Shoop) remains as one of my favorite songs that she did from a film soundtrack. The simplicity of her own voice and beloved heart still ignites a intimate fire that hasn't seemed to go out after all this time. It is one of my favorite movie songs, and truthfully one of Whitney Houston's best. If you have never heard the music from Waiting To Exhale, than I sincerely suggest you download Exhale (Shoop Shoop.)\n\nSong: B+","classification":4}

{"text":"You have to give Carly Simon her just dues...after what was arguably one of her most prolific decades to date, you would think she just might kick back and relax for a bit. I mean, over the last ten years we've had a batch of eclectic, albeit brilliant, originals (2008's THIS KIND OF LOVE), 2007's soothing INTO WHITE, a reunion with Richard Perry in 2005 (for the lush standards collection MOONLIGHT SERENADE) and 2000's extremely personal THE BEDROOM TAPES. A break should definitely be in order, right?!? No way!\n Instead, Simon chose to wrap up the decade with NEVER BEEN GONE, a stripped down reimagining of many of her famous hits. Raw and unadorned, NEVER BEEN GONE is an important record for a number of reasons. First, it shows just how strong a songwriter Carly Simon really is...these songs are as powerful now they were thirty to forty years ago. It also shows what a true artist is...unafraid, vulnerable, honest. There are moments here when Simon's voice doesn't come across nearly as strong as on the original version, but, hey, that's cool...very few artists can say they do! At 64, Simon has earned he scars...and her accolades!\n Opening the disc with a relaxed version of \"The Right Thing To Do\", Simon sets the mood from the get go. Switching things from a piano based arrangement to an acoustic guitar one allows for a more easy-going vibe, which is only enhanced by ethereal backing vocals. Simon's lead vocal is slightly ragged, but that just adds to the overall effect, resulting in a comfortable groove.\n \"It Happens Every Day\" is one of the songs that benefits most from it's reworking. Originally a more subdued, sad reflection on and of loss, there's almost a lilt to the new version. Yes, it's still about the pain caused by the end of a relationship, but there's more wisdom present now, the knowledge that life DOES go on. This is all captured in a gorgeous lead vocal by Simon. One of my two favorite tracks off of NEVER BEEN GONE.\n The disc's title track experiences one of the more...unique...reworkings. Originally a hushed, almost religious, effort, the new take has a swaying, waltz-like feel to it. As Simon sings \"The wind is coming up strong and fast\/And the moon is smiling on me\", the listener is totally transported to another time and place. Absolutely lovely!\n \"Boys In The Trees\" is, without a doubt, my favorite cut on the album. There's a hypnotic urgency to the track, what with it's captivating arrangement, gorgeously layered lead vocal and haunting harmonies, courtesy of John Forte and daughter Sally Taylor (Why, oh, why has she stopped recording?!?!?). Everything about this version is sheer perfection....love, love, LOVE it!!\n I've never been a huge fan of \"Let The River Run\" ~ I've always thought \"Coming Around Again\" was much more deserving of the Oscar ~ but this version kind of grows on you. Starting out slow and acoustic-y, it builds in intensity, but never goes over the top the way the original does. In fact, this version is much more...spiritual. Nice!\n Simon's reworking of \"You're So Vain\", along with Matthew Sweet's and Susanna Hoffs' cover earlier this year (without a doubt the best thing about their UNDER THE COVERS VOL. 2), proves the song is, as stated by Rolling Stone, one of rock's Top 100 Greatest Songs. More primal and a lot more vicious, the energy just spits out of the speakers. Simon's lead vocal is equal parts gritty, growling, cryptic and crisp, while the arrangement is clever, but never cluttered. I guess you CAN go home again...and enjoy the trip!\n \"You Belong To Me\" is almost a miss for me...it's way too \"lounge-y\" for my tastes, lacking the sly, sexual heat of the original. However, Teese Gohl's stunning piano fills and some gutsy backing vocals lift it out of the \"loser\" column and put it smack dab in the \"O.K.\" one (I would have really liked to have seen this one tirned on it's head, be it thru a Country, dance or rock take).\n \"No Freedom\", the first of two new tracks, is a fun little ditty, and a direction I'd like to see Simon move in on future recordings...quirky, edgy, spirited. However, she almost gets lost on her own album...this is just as much a Ben Taylor cut with Mom on backing vocals as it is a Carly Simon track with son Ben guesting. Cheers for believing in your offspring, Carly...but this is your record!\n \"That's The Way I've Always Heard It Should Be\" is the only cut on NEVER BEEN GONE that doesn't work at all. While most of the songs benefit from added age and experience, \"That's The Way....\" is all about youth and starting out and the accompanying doubts. The arrangement pales compared to the original, while the lead vocal is shaky. I know she had to include the song, but I would have much rather had a percussion-driven version of \"Jesse\" in it's place.\n \"Coming Around Again\" gets off to a rocky start, with a lead vocal that's pinched and nasaly. In fact, it's almost comical. However, the arrangement is delicate and fresh, and how can it NOT tug on your heart when Simon sings the words \"I believe in love...What else can I do?\" Simon's vocal rights itself by song's end, particularly on the powerful outro....\"If I can just breathe\"....wise words.\n \"Anticipation\" is as touching as ever, but it's overall vibe is kind of flipped...while the original is all giddy and hopeful, this new take hints at inner doubts and uncertainties. And, yet, it still works. And Simon's lead vocal? WOW! From growl to purr, it's up front, forceful and focused. Definitely one of the disc's high points!\n Rounding things out is \"Songbird\", a song Simon first started back in 1970. Coming across it 39 years later, she polished it up and finished it off. A pretty piano ballad storysong, Simon's 1970's vocal nicely segues into her 2009 one, showing where Simon has been, where she's at, and, hopefully, where she can still go.\n And that's the true magic of NEVER BEEN GONE...Carly Simon is a classic artist who's still incredibly relevant. Here's hoping she won't be GONE for years to come! (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for not only including the lyrics, but also commenting on why she chose each song, and how the reworkings came about. Kudos also for the cover artwork;VERY un-Simon, it's clever and fun!).","classification":4}

It has a good flow that matches her voice nicely and definitely much better than the cheap theatrics someone like Beyonce' or Rihanna have cheapened for their voices and songs. While it isn't as strong as her songs All The Way Home and Love & War delivered, it still is a pretty good song. Hopefully, radio will pick up on the song, and show that Tamar isn't just labeled as a one-album wonder. That is something you should let her know.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4}

{"text":"I'm starting to sound like a broken record on these.  Again, this is one of 7 \"Rise of the Masters\" collections I purchased as part of a sensory integration therapy program for our son, who has a deeply entrenched dislike of headphones.  Actually, that's an oversimplification.  It would be more accurate to say that they feel radically different on his head then they would to you or I and he  still can't tolerate that sensation well most of the time, and there's probably a sensitivity to sound component in there as well.  Usually the best we can get is for him to allow them around his neck for a short period of time while one of his favorite movies plays on my kindle.  Music generally is too unmotivating to even get him to try and deal with the headphones from his perspective.  Since the type of Auditory Integration Therapy used by my son's OT clinic uses headphones, we've been kind of dying on that hill, but some of the studies into the efficacy of this method for treating sensory issues have indicated that traditional, unmodulated classical music can produce similar benefits.  So we purchased these a while back as a work around it, trying to still get the job done kind of solution and have been quite satisfied with them.  The price point is awesome, which given that we pour money like crazy on therapeutic supports for our son, I am a big, big fan of.","classification":5}

{"text":"\"Red\" is pianist\/composer Isadar's genre-defying tenth solo piano album and seventeenth independent release from the past twenty years. It is also the third installment in a trilogy of solo piano albums released in the past year - \"Reconstructed,\" a Will Ackerman-produced anthology of some of Isadar's best piano pieces; \"O Christmas,\" Isadar's second piano Christmas album; and now \"Red,\" a bittersweet love-themed album that took seven years to produce and that consists of the first new original solo piano material Isadar has released in more than ten years. I have been reviewing and thoroughly enjoying Isadar's releases since his second piano album, 1999's \"Active Imagination,\" which still stands as one of my favorite recordings. Even though I have been a big fan for many years, I was still blown away by Isadar's live performance in my house concert series in July 2010. The man has magic fingers and an extraordinary piano touch that are perfectly suited to express his imaginative, distinctive, and emotionally powerful music. Isadar is also a singer\/songwriter and an electronic musician who creates the music videos for much of his music, dramatizing the stories that inspired the songs. I will always be partial to Isadar's piano albums because his voice and vision are unique, incorporating jazz, new age, pop, and classical stylings into a musical language all his own.\n\n\"Red\" opens with \"Broken Valentine,\" a free-flowing expression of heartbreak and the broad range of emotions that go with it, alternating between grief and confusion then shifting to perhaps anger and resignation - a great beginning. The title track conveys the freedom of an improvisation while weaving together a variety of upbeat themes. \"The Man Who Broke My Heart\" is energetic and in constant swirling motion - also very free and from deep within. \"The Stairwell\" is darker and much more mysterious, overflowing with Isadar's intriguing accented rhythms and picturesque compositional style. My favorite track is the almost nine-minute \"Letting Go,\" a piece that intertwines a series of musical vignettes into a powerful, colorful musical collage. I love the way Isadar seamlessly goes from flowing and smooth to a bouncy jazz style to high drama without missing a beat. Great stuff! \"En Face Du Miroir (Facing the Mirror)\" is much lighter, with fingers dancing nimbly around the piano keyboard. The album closes with \"Blood ... Thicker Than Water,\" again a combination of changing themes that could well be a musical family portrait - different personalities working separately and as a unit, bound together by the unseen ties that keep families together through thick and thin.\n\nIsadar has created another piano masterpiece that should be more widely heard than his previous releases due to the success of \"Reconstructed.\" I hope so, anyway! Very highly recommended!","classification":5}

{"text":"In 1971 I repaired to the new Madison Square Garden in New York accompanied by my buddy Steve on a tough date night. I was twenty years old and as my raging angst and hormones rebelled within my adolescent system, I wanted to calm down by going to a concert offered by a devastatingly handsome and tall hippy like singer song writer named James Taylor, subsequently to be monikered JT. Insiders in the music business were well aware of this young man's gift for guitar and song writing and distinctive vocal style. He had spent some time in Greenwich Village with his group James Taylor and The Flying Machine achieving some following. Interestingly enough in maybe 1968 James did some session work with the Beatles at Apple Records. You really have to be good to do session work. Glen Campbell and Nicolette Larson were two of my favorites background musicians or vocalists the latter was an outstanding vocalist, both of them emerged from the background afterwards. Anyway, we get into the Garden and immediately notice that the place was half full. James was sitting on a stool and there was actually debris on the stage. He sang Fire and Rain and I was stunned at how I connected with the song. After that the kids, all of us emotionally wound by the era and the god awful one that proceeded it went on to as fans to help to create a mega star in James Taylor. Incidently I understand that he will soon appear with his old friend and collaborator Carol\nKing, probably up there in the top five singer song writers of our generation. This is what I have desired for the music industry beginning five years ago when I started out as a critic and it is beginning to happen with the Who chosen to perform at the Super bowl and Paul McCartney performing on television. Getting back to James Taylor, he exemplifies verifiable genetic talent, we really need that today anywhere we can get it.\nJay Adler","classification":5}

{"text":"In April of 1973, The Beatles had already released THE BEATLES 1962-1966. But in April of 1973, the same month & year, The Beatles released their 21st album entitled, THE BEATLES 1967-1970, the follow-up to THE BEATLES 1962-1966. This album features more of The Beatles greatest hits, only this time, the hits from 1967-1970 are featured. Nothing but the best of The Beatles.\n\nDisc One: 1967-1968\n\nSTRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER\n\n  From the album MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (1967). A great song that I have enjoyed for years. This is amongst their greatest hits.\n\nPENNY LAN\n\n  From the album MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (1967). Great song.\n\nSGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND\n\n  From the album SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND (1967). Definitely another greatest hit. That opening line, \"...It was 20 years ago today when Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play...\" is just the best.\n\nWITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS\n\n  From the album SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND (1967). Another great song led by Ringo.\n\nLUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS\n\n  From the album SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND (1967). Great song. Very 60s-cycodelic.\n\nA DAY IN THE LIFE\n\n  From the album SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND (1967). Seems as though that the SGT. PEPPER album was very popular, indeed. A great song.\n\nALL YOU NEED IS LOVE\n\n  From the album MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (1967). Awesome.\n\nI AM THE WALRUS\n\n  From the album MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (1967). One of my favorite songs off of the MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR album.\n\nHELLO, GOODBYE\n\n  From the album MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (1967). Awesome.\n\nTHE FOOL ON THE HILL\n\n  From the album MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (1967). Great.\n\nMAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR\n\n  From the album MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (1967). The title track, at last. Great tune.\n\nLADY MADONNA\n\n  From the single release LADY MADONNA (1968). Awesome.\n\nHEY JUDE\n\n  From the single release HEY JUDE (1968). This stood out as the biggest selling Beatles single out of them all. This one of their absolute best songs ever recorded. I know that on September 23rd of this year when I see Paul McCartney in concert for the very first time, he will do this song. I can't wait to hear him do it. Now this song was released as only a single back in 1968. But in 1970, just a few months before the release of LET IT BE, The Beatles put together another compilation album entitled HEY JUDE (THE BEATLES AGAIN). Some new songs were put on the album, along with \"Hey Jude\", which is where the got the name for the 1970 compilation album.\n\nREVOLUTION\n\n  Original version from the album THE BEATLES (1968). Single version from the single release REVOLUTION (1968). While the album version was very good, I really enjoyed this version much more.\n\nDisc Two: 1968-1970\n\nBACK IN THE U.S.S.R.\n\n  From the album THE BEATLES (1968). My all-time favorite Beatles song, with \"Hey Jude\", standing right behind it.\n\nWHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS\n\n  From the album THE BEATLES (1968). For a long time, I never favored this song. But after awhile, I began to like this song.\n\nOB-LA-DI, OB-LA-DA\n\n  From the album THE BEATLES (1968). Okay, I'll pronounce one last time because I am Mr. Nice Guy. Here it goes: OH BLA DEE, OH BLA DA. I love this song. It's just a very fun song, a song for a everybody, who has a sense of humor.\n\nGET BACK\n\n  From the album LET IT BE (1970). I love this song.\n\nDON'T LET ME DOWN\n\n  From the album HEY JUDE (THE BEATLES AGAIN) (1970). Great.\n\nTHE BALLAD OF JOHN AND YOKO\n\n  From the album HEY JUDE (THE BEATLES AGAIN) (1970). Blah! I hate Yoko Ono.\n\nOLD BROWN SHOE\n\n  From the album HEY JUDE (THE BEATLES AGAIN) (1970). Great.\n\nHERE COMES THE SUN\n\n  From the album ABBEY ROAD (1969). Great.\n\nCOME TOGETHER\n\n  From the album ABBEY ROAD (1969). This was another one of those many songs that I did not like, but years later, I began to like it.\n\nSOMETHING\n\n  From the album ABBEY ROAD (1969). Great.\n\nOCTOPUS'S GARDEN\n\n  From the album ABBEY ROAD (1969). This song is another fun-filled song led by Ringo. It would be Ringo's last written contribution, as well as his last lead vocal performance as a Beatle.\n\nLET IT BE\n\n  From the album LET IT BE (1970). Just a beautiful ballad.\n\nACROSS THE UNIVERSE\n\n  From the album LET IT BE (1970). Great.\n\nTHE LONG AND WINDING ROAD\n\n  From the album LET IT BE (1970). This is one of my all-time favorite songs from the LET IT BE album. Beautiful ballad.\n\n  This compilation is even better than the first, since it features more of your favorite Beatles songs from '67 to '70. THE BEATLES 1967-1970 is yours if you buy a copy now.","classification":5}

It was a rock orchestra with all the elements of a classical symphony, containing a great song structure that creates a great atmosphere. It starts off slow, then slowly starts into the marching beats of war, then launches into the all-out assault of battle. And best of all, it isn't classical music, it's rock. Pure rockin' blazin' guitars that leave you satisfied to the utmost.\n\nA Christmas classic, and a true masterpiece from the Trans-Siberian Orchestra.

It really was just absolutely awful. I think Ke$ha should really try and take her time for finding better material to call upon her own, than wasting her time to find another Tik Tok in her words.

{"text":"What a joy to see this old LP recording from the late 1950s re-mastered by Sony to take the best of the Columbia recording and make it better.  Few can make Brahms ring so true as Bruno Walter could and this recording, made in Los Angeles with the 'Coumbia Symphony Orchestra' shows off the maestro to great advantage. Bruno Walter (September 15, 1876 - February 17, 1962) was in the autumn years of his life when he made this recording and that aura of time and countless performances of these works gratefully remains captured here.\n\nWalter was so immersed in his music that his soul was evident in every phrase.  This is a Brahms first of great majesty. His tempi are a bit on the slow end of the spectrum , but that serve only to make his climaxes more thrilling.  The 'Haydn Variations' are so well conceived that they sound completely thought through, as though in conversation with Brahms, and the 'Academic Festival Overture' has both the joy and the pomp of the 'Gaudeamus Igitur' the work holds.  Of very special note, there is in Los Angeles a 'happening' over the nest weeks.  Gustavo Dudamel has programmed a survey called 'Brahms Unbound' and opened the first concert in this in depth look at the works of Brahms with both the Academic Festival Overture and the Symphony No. 1.  Critics and audiences somehow always expect performances of Brahms to be safest in the hands of elder conductors, by Dudamel unveiled a propinquity for Brahms that bodes very well indeed for the fat that here may be our next great Brahms conductor.  Returning to this CD of Bruno Walter and having just heard Dudamel on the podium with the Los Angeles Philharmonic provides a great resurgence in the appreciation of the genius of Johannes Brahms.

{"text":"The First Minute of a New Day is where Gil Scott-Heron and multi-instrumentalist Brian Jackson truly hit their stride. Unlike Winter In America, which was a very introspective album, this release stirs up the pot musically. Scott-Heron's vocals, which could be choppy on his earlier albums, are in fine form throughout and his spoken word observations are more focused without losing any of their conviction. It's also here where the music truly matches the power of Scott-Heron's message. The album's opening track, \"Offering\", is very solemn and is carried by an emotional flute line by Jackson and great harmonies from both Scott-Heron and vocalist Victor Brown. Tracks like the cool R&B of \"Must Be Something\", the jazzy \"Western Sunrise\", and the funky \"No Such Thing As Superman\" are top notch and feature great sax playing from Bilal Sunni Ali. Heron's lyrics remain as poignant as ever on the mid-tempo turned shuffle of \"Guerilla\" and the aforementioned \"Must Be Something.\" The track \"Alluswe\" is an elegant ballad similar to those on Winter In America and feature smooth vocals from Scott-Heron and beautiful piano from Jackson. While the spoken word pieces \"Pardon Our Analysis\" and \"A Talk...\" may sound dated today, they're both clever and intelligent as he correctly observes the social inequalities that were present in the mid-1970's. Although everything here is first rate, there are two tracks that take the album to another level. \"The Liberation Song (Red, Black, and Green)\" is the most exciting track that Gil Scott-Heron has ever performed. Driven by an intense performance from the Midnight Band, the music matches their plea for equal rights perfectly. Finally, \"Winter In America\" is a haunting ballad with some of his most thoughtful lyrics. The solo version included at the album's conclusion featuring just Gil and his piano is just as powerful. All told, The First Minute of a New Day is the strongest studio release from Gil Scott-Heron, Brian Jackson, and the Midnight Band. Highly recommended.","classification":5}

{"text":"\"The future ain't what it used to be\"\n - from \"Tennessee Song\"\n\nVery frank, personal and committed songwriting (Margo Price co-wrote nine of the ten tracks here) and vocal interpretation, reminiscent of prime Loretta Lynn (the album's title is a tip of the cap to the coal miner's daughter) and Dolly Parton, with modern sensibilities and diverse musical arrangements.  And there is also a doff of the chapeau (\"Hurtin' [On the Bottle]\") given to the late, great Merle Haggard, as this is uncompromising, somewhat out-of-the-mainstream stuff, unafraid to be on the outside and occasionally go \"outlaw.\"  It's all incredibly entertaining.\n\n\"Four Years of Chances\" is one of the coolest songs of the year - an intensity-building, rhythmic country-soul rocker that would seem to be in a future-classic league with Etta James' \"Seven Day Fool.\"\n\nThe opener \"Hands of Time\" plumbs the depths of disillusionment while still holding out great hope for the future within the confines of the same beautifully arranged country ballad.  \"About to Find Out\" reminds one of Loretta at her feistiest and most determined (think \"Fist City,\" among others).\n\n\"This Town Gets Around\" goes after Nashville's sexism and sleazy ethics; and in the pedal-steel-drenched honky-tonker \"Since You Put Me Down,\" the singer admits to being \"an outcast and a stray.\"  \"Weekender\" has her \"backslidin' again\" and landing in the county jail.\n\nThe one Margo Price did not co-author, \"How the Mighty Have Fallen,\" is a tuneful and touching ballad with a huge hook that one could imagine Roy Orbison having sung.\n\nEasily one of the finest efforts of the year.","classification":5}

{"text":"Overall this is a good album, not superb or great, but very good. INTUITION the single is excellent, and the remix CD Single is also recommended. Being at the top of the dance chart means the majority think the same way.\nThe other cuts such as \"Stand\" and \"America\" are also very good.\nFor those that think (or don't think at all), that this is a \"sudden\" change obviously have not heard 'Serve The Ego' or its remixes from about a year ago. Another dance chart topper, this album CONTINUES the trend that was already beginning on her last album. Check out the \"Serve The Ego\" mixes, those are excellent.\nI love to hear people say \"she sold out\", \"she has changed\" and other assorted basic critical comments. Does that sound familiar? Remember the Bob Dylan as he went electric? The Beatles going Sgt Pepper? Sheena Easton doing \"Strut\". Are we saying Madonna did not change???Toni Braxton? The list goes on and on. Even Nsync changed! Those who refuse to change or cannot accept change are living in the past.\nI can accept opinions of those who just don't like the music, that is fine, ok, and thats an example of how people have differing tastes, but just to say 'Sell out sell out\" to me  means  \"Grow...change..that is life\". The only acts and artists that sound the same always are at oldie shows. I applaud her willingness to try to stretch her considerable range and talent. Its still there and shows on this CD,\nThe album is good, has a few outstanding songs, 1 great song in \"Intuition\", and is a 3 to 4 star CD.  Its is not \"Hands\" or \"Pieces of You\" but is not supposed to be. I think its worth a listen, and the opinion of how good it is is yours. Do not be steered by people who do not like change. Treat it as a \"new\" sound and listen. Its your money, and the choice is yours. Like art, there is no \"absolute\" just opinions. Good Listening!","classification":4}

{"text":"Mary J. Blige - Growing Pains (Geffen, 2007)\n\nWhenever you release a big album (be it classic, certified platinum or both), expectations are always gonna be high for your follow-up. How do you exactly follow an album like Mary J. Blige's 2005 hit,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Breakthrough\/dp\/B000BNTM32\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Breakthrough<\/a>? Well, she must not have worried about it, as Growing Pains is another great album.\n\nAlthough her first single, \"Just Fine\", wasn't exactly the smash that \"Be Without You\" was, it showed her on a more fun and upbeat track than usual. But for everyone who says that she sounds best on tracks about drama, \"Hurt Again\" and \"Talk to Me\" are right up your alley. The only problem is that after 16 years of albums, some of these topics can start to sound redundant. That's why that tracks like the NE-YO\/StarGate-produced \"Fade Away\" and \"Come to Me (Peace)\" are a nice change of pace. Even the duet with Usher, \"Shake Down\", while only a fair song, adds a little bit of love into the mix.\n\nYou can still rely on Mary J. Blige to deliver that great R&B in a time where R&B is losing the battle with hip-hop and country music as the leading genres. The only question is how Mary will follow up this album. -EJR","classification":4}

{"text":"I like pretty much everything Kid Rock has ever done, he's an artist that always evolves and here on \"Rebel Soul\" he continues to slide from genre to genre with great success.  Kid Rock on \"Rebel Soul\" is less rapper and more Bob Seger, an influence that is hard to miss on Kid's latest works.  Overall the songwriting is good here and moves from a bit of country twang to some hard hitting horns for some Detroit soul.\n\nWhile there is still some use of the auto-tune showing up here, Kid is more and more showing off his vocal chops here as a singer.  He may not have the best range, but he makes great use of what he has.  I really did find myself picking up bits of Seger and James Brown throughout the disc.\n\nThe second song on the disc is \"Let's Ride,\" a song that is heavily in support of the brave men and women of the armed services.  Kid does them proud here with a song that rocks hard and carries a heavy meaning.  This song alone is worth the price of the album.\n\nI also have to admit that it's nice getting an album like this from a guy that is on the conservative side of the aisle willing to talk about how the government is trying to bring us to a \"one world nation.\"  If the kids would only listen to Kid before it's too late!\n\nOverall, this is a fun album with Kid Rock showing off his songwriting and genre melding music.  Highly recommended!","classification":5}

{"text":"This album was released in the UK and Canada in late 2001, and in the US in early 2002. The main difference is the US version has a track called \"When You Walk Away\", and the UK\/Canadian printings have a great song called \"You Take It All\" instead of \"When You Walk Away\", and vice versa for the US. LIVING PROOF is a great album that builds on the strength of BELIEVE, however this album never really lived to its potential, it didn't catch on as much as BELIEVE did to listeners. \"Song For The Lonely\" was a song that really resonated with a lot of people, with it's universal theme. In fact, a lot of the songs were like the ones on BELIEVE, with a message of strength and survival through life's difficult stages. As a whole, this album is better than BELIEVE. The only tracks I could have done without is the R&B tinged \"Rain Rain\" and the Diane Warren latin infused \"Body To Body, Heart To Heart\". The rest of the album is just great. I actually like Cher's version of Amber's \"Love One Another\", more than Amber's version. \"Love Is A Lonely Place Without You\" is like an epic ballad dance song, should have been a single. \"Real Love\" is a really funky Daft Punk sounding song, very european. \"Alive Again\" and \"A Different Kind Of Love Song\" are other highlights, with great positive messages. Other highlights include \"You Take It All\" (one of the best on the album) and \"When The Money's Gone\". Overall a really strong album from Cher!

{"text":"Muskrat Love is one of those humorous songs that somehow unintentionally morphed into some kind of deep commentary on shallow love.  Initially composed as a whimsical tune about anthropomorphic muskrats under the name Muskrat Candlelight, it was a minor hit for America before The Captain and Tenille turned it into a huge hit in the 1970's.\n\nNow, decades later, this song is a nostalgic reminder of a more innocent time.  The MP3 version is far clearer than any 45 record or LP album cut from the 1970's, so it's far more enjoyable, especially The Captain's electronic sounds of muskrats kissing and mating.\n\nFor a modern 21st century audience, this song probably won't catch their ear or have the same meaning. It'll come across as though it's a song from a cartoon.  But for anyone who heard this song in the 1970's and just wants a reminder of a different time in life, it's worth the download for the gentle smile and memories it will evoke.","classification":5}

Whether it is \"you give love a bad name\" , \"Ballad of youth\", \"dry county\", \"hard times comes easy\", \"Every road leads home to you\", and the list can go on, the songs have always had a great impact on me. Now coming to this album, I was wondering how Richie would approach, which route will he go. After hearing the opening track \"burn the candle down\" which is a great way to start a rock album, to the last song \"world\" which is just a great track to close the record, i was very happy to see the new album is on the right path of R&R.  My fav track on this album is \"seven years gone, every road leads home to you, Learning how to fly, Burn the candle down, Weathering the storm, taking a chance on the wind & now days\". The other track are good too, but the earlier mentioned track are personally my favorite. For me this is a really great album, would recommend it any one who likes good rock & roll album. Richie stands out very well on his own, the previous two and now this album show's that not only is he a awesome guitarist but a a great singer and song writer. So far my fav album of this year and my fav Richie Sambora album. Looking fwd to seeing him in concert.","classification":5}

{"text":"UK Trip Hop Act Massive Attack have shed not a few members along the way. Presently a duo comprising 3D & Daddy G, they return with \"Heligoland\", their 5th album and first in 7 years. Named after a German archipelago, it features vocals from a plethora of highly placed friends; Tunde Adebimpe of TV On The Radio on the opening brooding \"Pray for Rain\" (with drum rolls and deep bass), Martina Topley-Bird on the bouncy \"Babel\" (with reverb effects & fractured drums) and \"Psyche\" (with cyclic sounding guitars), Grant Marshall, Horace Andy and Robert Del Naja on the dark \"Splitting the Atom\" (with lyrics touching on bank bail-outs), Horace Andy on the droning \"Girl I Love You\", Guy Garvey of Elbow on the bleep\/hum-filled \"Flat of the Blade\", and the delicate acoustic \"Saturday Come Slow\" with Damon Albarn turning in a soft performance.\n\nGloomy theatrical strings, hushed vocals, and dense beats still abound, and while the sound is not as dark as 2003's \"100th Window\", it still takes a while for it all to sink in. \"Rush Minute\" (with chiming\/chugging guitars) and the ominous \"Atlas Air\" feature Robert Del Naja (3D), while \"Paradise Circus\" features Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval's airy vocals with sprinklings of piano and hand claps set to a choppy dubby bassline.\n\nEverything on this CD is simply outstanding, like a trip to some fantasy island. Along with Tricky (a Massive Attack alumnus) and Portishead (whose Adrian Utley helps out musically here), Massive Attack were at the forefront of the nineties Trip Hop movement. Great to have them back.","classification":5}

{"text":"I have honestly been intrigued by what Meghan Trainor had done musically, ever since she had released her song from The Peanuts Movie, Better When I'm Dancin'. But honestly, with all the hype that she had brought out into her second album, Thank You. After having good songs like Dear Future Husband, and All About That Bass from her first album, she has had a lot of pressure following up her debut. Well, the set of songs so far she had put out for her second album, Thank You, really aren't that strong as her first record. No and Watch Me Do were really farther departures from her original sound, which showed she could sing. I Love Me, the third track released on the upcoming album, Thank You really is a small improvement, but not really a song to cry for on her album. Her collaboration with newcomer LunchMoney Lewis, lets him do more of the work in vocals, were Meghan herself steps back and doesn't bring out enough of her own game in the song. Perhaps, Meghan should take herself into a better direction that stepping backwards.\n\nSong: C 1\/2-","classification":3}

{"text":"The Rolling Stones' work over the last 50 years has been divided into two periods - their Decca\/London work of the '60s, owned by the late Allen Klein's ABKCO Records, and their post-1971 material released on the band's own imprint (distributed over the years by Atlantic, WEA, EMI, and CBS (Sony)).  When the group signed with  Virgin Records in 1992, Rolling Stones Records folded; the group's post-1971 catalog is now distributed by Universal Music Group, which, ironically, manufactures and distributes ABKCO.  For legal reasons, all Stones compilations until 2002 were split between the two periods.  \"Brown Sugar\" and \"Wild Horses\" - recorded at the end of the Decca period, but initially released on Rolling Stones Records both as singles and on the STICKY FINGERS album, are jointly owned by ABKCO and the band, and appear on both ABKCO and Rolling Stones Records\/Virgin\/Universal compilations.\n\nThe first career-spanning Stones compilation was the 2002 collection&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Forty-Licks\/dp\/B00006IR69\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Forty Licks<\/a>.  For the group's 50th anniversary, ABKCO and Universal have compiled GRRR!, the most comprehensive overview of The Stones' career to date, with tracks ranging from the band's first 1963 single, Chuck Berry's \"Come On,\" to two brand-new 2012 tracks, \"Doom and Gloom\" and \"One More Shot.\"\n\nI don't own all of The Stones' hits packages, but here is how GRRR! compares to the ones that I do own:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Hot-Rocks-1964-1971\/dp\/B00006EXDM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hot Rocks 1964-1971<\/a>:  All of the songs from this compilation are on GRRR!, but there are two differences:  HOT ROCKS has the full-length version of \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Let-It-Bleed-Remastered\/dp\/B00006AW2G\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Let It Bleed (Remastered)<\/a>, whereas GRRR! uses the stereo single edit (previously issued only in mono). Also, GRRR! uses the LET IT BLEED version of \"Midnight Rambler,\" while HOT ROCKS uses the live recording from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Get-Yer-Ya-Ya-s-Out-Remastered\/dp\/B00006AW2K\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! (Remastered)<\/a>.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/More-Hot-Rocks-Big-Hits-Fazed-Cookies\/dp\/B00006EXDO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">More Hot Rocks: Big Hits & Fazed Cookies<\/a>:  Five tracks from the main portion of this collection - \"Tell Me,\" \"Good Times, Bad Times,\" \"Sittin' On A Fence,\" \"No Exceptations,\" and \"Let It Bleed\" are not included on GRRR! Only one track from the \"rarities\" section (Side 4 of the original album, and the last 11 tracks on the remastered CD) is included on GRRR! - \"Come On.\"\n\nFORTY LICKS:  All of the tracks on Disc 1 (the ABKCO disc) are on GRRR!, aside from a few mono\/stereo differences on songs like \"Paint It, Black,\" \"Ruby Tuesday,\" and \"Let's Spend the Night Together,\" plus the different versions of \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" mentioned earlier.  Seventeen of the twenty tracks on Disc 2 (the Rolling Stones Records\/Virgin\/Universal disc) also appear on GRRR!, but only one of the four 2002 songs is included - \"Don't Stop.\"\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Rolling-Stones-Singles-Collection-The-London-Years\/dp\/B00006EXED\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Rolling Stones Singles Collection: The London Years<\/a>&nbsp;and the three CD box sets of individual singles (THE SINGLES 1963-1965, THE SINGLES 1965-1967, and THE SINGLES 1968-1971) contain a lot of B-sides and (in the case of THE SINGLES 1963-1965) EP tracks that are not included on GRRR!\n\nThe packaging on the Super Deluxe Version of GRRR! is impressive, but bulky.  The box contains a poster from a 1963 tour, a slotted cardboard insert containing a black envelope with five art prints from the band's various tours over the years, and a 7\" vinyl EP with four early songs from a BBC radio show, recorded in experimental stereo. The EP's back cover has liner notes in the same size and font as the group's original 1963 EP, THE ROLLING STONES. CONSUMER ALERT: The EP plays at LP speed (33 1\/3 RPM), not 45 RPM, as most vinyl EPs do, so set your turntable speed accordingly.  Of the EP's four songs, one, a Bo Diddley number called \"Cops and Robbers,\" was never recorded by The Stones elsewhere. Bobby Troup's \"Route 66\" was issued in 1964 on the band's first album, and a live version surfaced on the 1965 GOT LIVE IF YOU WANT IT! EP (not on the 1966 U.S. album of the same name), and was issued in America in 1965 on London Records' DECEMBER'S CHILDREN (AND EVERYBODY'S).  Arthur Alexander's \"You Better Move On\" appeared on The Stones' self-titled British EP, and in America on DECEMBER'S CHILDREN as well.  The blues number \"Mona\" appeared on the group's 1964 UK Decca debut album, THE ROLLING STONES, but was replaced with the single \"Not Fade Away\" on the American London version, ENGLAND'S NEWEST HIT MAKERS.  \"Mona\" appeared in the U.S. in 1965 on the third London album, THE ROLLING STONES, NOW!  Then there is the 96-page book, containing a bonus CD of five mono IBC demos from 1963 (\"Diddley Daddy,\" \"Road Runner,\" \"Bright Lights, Big City,\" \"Honey What's Wrong,\" and \"I Want To Be Loved.\")  The first four tracks were never recorded elsewhere; \"I Want To Be Loved\" was later re-recorded and released as the B-side to \"Come On.\"\n\nThe bonus CD is stored in the inside front cover of the book, while the four main CDs are stored in the inside back cover.  The book contains an essay by Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine (yes, partially named after the group), some nice black-and-white photos of The Stones, plus some very nice memorabilia, but I would have preferred an illustrated discography, and the lyrics to the songs as well. Also, the track listings, which show a performance copyright of 2004 for the ABKCO material and 2010 for the Rolling Stones Records\/Virgin\/Universal material, except for the two new 2012 songs, could have been more detailed, showing when each track was recorded, the original release date, and what LP that the track(s) originally were issued on.\n\nDisc 1 - all tracks mono, except \"It's All Over Now,\" \"Heart of Stone,\"  \"Time Is On My Side\" (unfortunately, the remake, not the original), \"Paint It, Black,\" \"She's a Rainbow,\" \"Under My Thumb,\" and \"Out of Time.\"\n\nDisc 2 - all tracks stereo, except for \"Mother's Little Helper,\" which is the mono single version, not the stereo version from AFTERMATH UK.\n\nDiscs 3 and 4 - all tracks stereo.\n\nIf you are a newcomer to The Rolling Stones and want just one definitive collection,  GRRR! is the one for you.  The Super Deluxe Edition is expensive, but there are also two-CD and three-CD versions of GRRR! available.  Choose the one that fits your budget and your needs.  I purchased the Super Deluxe Edition because it contained 34 tracks that I did not own elsewhere (three on ABKCO; 22 on Rolling Stones Records\/Virgin\/Universal, including the two new 2012 songs, plus the nine bonus tracks on the two EPs).  In addition, all of the songs on the 2-CD set (available at Target and certain other select retailers) are on the 3-CD Deluxe Edition, and all of the material on the 3-CD set is on the Super Deluxe Edition, so it's not necessary to buy multiple editions of GRRR! to obtain \"missing\" tracks.\n\nOn the other hand, if you already own the bulk of the material, and don't care about the new 2012 songs, the BBC recordings, or the IBC demos, skip it.  Of course, you could always download the material that you don't own.","classification":4}

His band (The Sensational Space Shifters) featuring guitarists Justin Adams and Liam `Skin' Tyson and long-time associate John Baggot on keyboards are also very adaptable and manage to meld all these different styles together into a pleasing mix that makes sense and sounds good. They are joined by Billy Fuller on bass and Dave Smith on drums, as well as the Gambian multi-instrumentalist Juldeh Camara to add a bit of third world authenticity.\n\n\"Little Maggie\" and \"Rainbow\" from the Glastonbury set and both released as singles get us off to a great start, \"Little Maggie\" mixing country, blues and African music and \"Rainbow\" sounding like Bo Diddley meets U2. I really liked the reworking of the old Leadbelly song \"Poor Howard\", which sounds like it could have been a Zeppelin acoustic workout. It's not just recycled roots though, there is lots of originality and variety here from the beautiful haunting piano-based ballad \"A stolen kiss\" (which contains the album's title in its lyrics), to the more folky \"Embrace Another Fall\" where he shares the vocals with Julie Murphy and the quite poppy, much lighter \"House of love\" and \"Somebody there\", the latter with its great sounding guitars.\n\nAlthough Robert's distinctive voice is at the centre of all the songs the band also play their part in making this an outstanding record, both their individual contributions and their wonderful ensemble playing. You've got to admire how Robert continues to juggle all his musical interests - rock, soul, blues, folk, country, ballads, electronica, African, Middle Eastern - and, rather than concentrating on just one, manages to combine them all and still take his music forward rather than wallowing in his past.","classification":5}

But for his latest album Tuskegee, it has worked very well with his fans and new Country music fans all over. His latest single Stuck On You, teaming up with Darius Rucker from Hootie & The Blowfish fame, and solo Country music fame works very well. The song is just as down to Earth as when Lionel originally made it nearly 30 years ago. I like the intimate style of the song, and Darius lends his vocals well on the classic. I have honestly recommended Tuskegee very well, and this is a great download to your music library.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","classification":4}

I am amazed, jealous and very thankful that today people have such vast collections of the world's finest music available at dirt cheap prices.

{"text":"Nina Simone has always been difficult to classify although this album is pretty close to a straight ahead R&B \/ Soul outin with some vocal pop thrown in.  The only nod to jazz is the Porgy & Bess number \"My Man's Gone Now\".  Although Ms. Simone can tend to be self indulgent at times, she reins in that tendency here with a selection of songs (4 are self penned) that really fit the Blues theme which is very fitting to her style and persona.  The arrangements are also excellent with a tight band that supports but does not overwhelm the songs - no strings, no brass.\nMy favorite thing here is a rollicking barrelhouse version of \"House of the Rising Sun\", completely unlike the version made famous by The Animals.  While not everything works as well as that, there is never any doubt about NS's commitment to the material.","classification":4}

{"text":"It is sincerely sad whenever someone young and talented dies before your heart. Natalie Cole knew that dear feeling, not just with the death of her beloved father, the great Nat King Cole, but also in herself, with her saddened passing New Year's Eve in 2015. She had showcased a brilliant and beautiful bravado of songs that really have with stood the test of time, on her own and healing through the soul of jazz and R&B soul overall. When I have thought of Natalie Cole, I think of her deepest songs that really showed all sides from pop and R&B like Snowfall In The Sahara, Live For Your Love and the dearest ballad of them all, Unforgettable. The song which Nat King Cole recorded on his own was one thing, but when Natalie did it in 1991, it really became timeless beyond what words could ever expect. It is just one of those duets that really drives you at the heartstrings so deep, you'll forget what cheap music of today really is. This is a must download for any die hard fan of Nat's, Natalie's or for anyone that really never heard of what great songs were like.\n\nSong: A","classification":5}

Most of the LPs from which these songs have been culled are long out of print, but they are treasures, every one. Most folks will be familiar with the songs he wrote that became hits by other artists (\"Crazy\", Patsy Cline; \"Night Life\", Ray Price, etc.), and he has re-recorded many of these since on other albums. But these are all the originals, remastered in outstanding sound quality!\n\nThis double CD package has 50 songs in all and is a MUST HAVE for not only Willie fans, but also those who love the old-style country songs.

{"text":"\"[as] far as poetry, I'm Nas, Biggie, Jay, Mos Def \/ Rakim, Kool G. Rap, Kane, KRS \/ Pac, Common, and Kanye would say I'm blessed\" (AZ - Still Alive)\n\nAZ, perhaps, one of the most underrated lyricists to grace hip hop, returns back to the scene by dropping his new album entitled, A.W.O.L., on his new independent Quiet Money Records label.  AZ is probably best known for his now legendary guest appearance on Life's a Bitch from Nas's classic Illmatic album.  AZ has always released quality material, but he was never been able to really blow up in the music scene.  Was it industry politics?  Bad timing?  Whatever the case is, AZ has never allowed for his lack of notoriety to effect his ability in creating quality music.\n\nWith A.W.O.L., rather than following the watered-down movement that's plagued rap for the last few years, AZ stays consistent and refuses to change up his formula.  He still has that smooth flawless delivery that's been blessing listeners since the early to mid 90's.  He's still that wise street poet who somehow is able to construct verses in a nearly flawless manner.  Plus, to further compliment the lyrics, the production on this album is top notch including beats by DJ Premier, Buckwild, and others...  The only weak spot on this album may be Envious featuring Bounty Killer, but that's only due to a clash of styles.\n\nTop tracks include:  The Come Up, Never Change, Still Alive, City Of Gods, and Magic Hour.\n\nGuest appearances include Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Half-A-Mill (recently deceased), Begetz, Bounty Killer, and CL Smooth...","classification":5}

{"text":"It's no secret that the hip-hop world is quite hostile towards the LGBT community.  Slurs demeaning one's sexual orientation get dropped with a frequency surpassed only by artists saying \"Yo!\".  There have been some tiny moves forward recently.  Frank Ocean, a respected hip-hop artist, has recently come out of the closet and produced well-received music.  Of course, others challenge his credibility as artist in a subtle attempt to undermine him and his message.\n\n  The next step is with Seattle-based rapper, Macklemore, taking shots at stereotypes and preconceived notions.  He doesn't have space in his world for the intolerance that leads to the discrimination of LGBT people.  So, this sweet ballad reaches out and tries to help people see the light of tolerance.  It may actually be a more constructive approach than an angry protest song.  I applaud Macklemore, and I hope that others will follow his lead.","classification":4}

{"text":"Even for the most ardent and knowledgeable fan of the Bach Guild\/Vanguard catalog, this collection might be a bit of a surprise. Certainly this collection shows the trademarks of the early 1950s era Bach Guild catalog, as the repertoire leans toward the baroque and classical masters. But this collection is more a tribute to the machinery that kept a small classical label alive. And the depth of the repertoire for brass and winds came as a small surprise  although it started as a tribute to a forgotten corner of the catalog.\n\nSome history  the post World War II time frame for The Bach Guild chronicles a richly fertile artistic period, where technology met art and both formed a marketplace. The scholarly rage that followed the end of the war, where students could at last find access to papers that had been off limits for over twenty years, unearthed a vein of musicology that revealed to the world undiscovered works by great composers, and new scholarship about the works once thought well known. The Solomon brothers were among the first to find Vienna at the center of this scholarship and the difficult post-war conditions gave them inexpensive access to musicians in one of the great music cities in the world. So, with the Solomon family money providing the technology, and local scholars eager to test their new discoveries and a city of starving musicians, The Bach Guild produced a vault of recordings of considerable artistic breadth.\n\nAnd with a city of fine musicians all looking for work, performing this repertoire was not difficult, as any combination of instruments could be matched easily and inexpensively. The Solomons were approached in the mid 1950s by the Austrian government and asked to create Austro-Vanguard, and investors were even brought into the equation, with the concept that Vanguard would establish a studio in Vienna and make a guaranteed number of recordings. From existing letters, neither brother was very excited by the idea, as they didn't want the issues that came with running a studio thousands of miles away (they didn't want own their own studio in the US either), and they figured they could work something out to get just what they wanted instead of a flood of recordings that they could barely control and that might send costs upward. So they continued to record three months a year, and the Viennese recording team was free to make recordings at their own, and Vanguard would have rights of refusal. Thus were made many Vienna State Opera Orchestra recordings, as well as the early recordings of the Concentus Musicus Wien.\nThat defines a large number of recordings in the Vanguard catalog. In order to exploit this wide array, the Solomons hit on the idea of the Virtuoso series, and they collected new recordings and released them according to instrument. So the Vanguard catalog has a series of Virtuoso recordings: Trumpet (3 volumes), Oboe (4 volumes and an orphan); Flute (3 recordings); Guitar (2 recordings and a few duplications); Harp (1); Clarinet (1); Harpsichord (2); recorder (1) and even a piano recording but that wasn't part of the original series. The recordings were made in Vienna and Prague.\n\nWeve combined recordings from trumpet, oboe, clarinet and recorder, as well as some other recordings featuring the horn and the bassoon from other corners of the catalog. Flute, you ask? There is none  there is so much of it, that we released all of that repertoire in the Big Flute Box earlier this year.\n\nWe also normally try and make these collections as complete as we can, but in the attempt to create a box that didn't tilt too heavily in the direction of the reed instruments (yes, four oboe recordings, with almost 4 hours of oboe repertoire seems a bit much for one box), we shaved a few recordings off this list, and placed those recordings in our upcoming Big Baroque Box 3.\nOur usual rundown of unreleased goodies  theres quite a bit here that has gone unreleased. About half of the oboe concertos that we have included are making their digital debut and most of them have gone unheard for a while  Vanguard collectors will remember a bad attempt at lifestyle compilations called Music for People Who Hate Opera that included the romantic era oboe recordings as well as the Wagner clarinet work (see belowhint: theres been a bit of a change regarding that work). But all of the trumpet and recorder works are getting their digital debuts with this release. Most of the trumpet repertoire was released on CD but the recorder recordings are receiving their first hearings since their LP release.\n\nA few points  at the request of some of our Facebook friends, we have included the recording of the Haydn oboe concerto, which we left out of our Big Haydn Box. We did that because scholarship has cast some doubt on whether this piece is by Haydn. Actually, its widely believed not to be written by Papa Haydn at all, but by Ignaz Malzat. But weve included it here because it certain does feature the oboe. Also, the well-regarded Virtuoso Clarinet recording featuring Jack Brymer is included here, but the Wagner piece Adagio for Clarinet and Strings is now attributed to Heinrich Josef Baermann.\n\nAnd this leaves us with the embarrassment of riches problem  this box could have been three hours longer! As we mentioned above, the Big Baroque 3 box is expected out this year and will contain more unreleased baroque goodies from the Bach Guild vaults. Thank you Vienna! Thank you!","classification":5}

{"text":"After many delays in production, Miami native, Kat Dahlia finally releases her debut effort My Garden. After many one-off releases (Gangsta, Clocks and Firemen) over the course of two years, Dahlia seeks to impress with the likes of a stockpile of Rihanna-ish mockeries and Jill Scott knockoffs. The songs navigate through a garden of Rap, Salsa, Jazz and R&B. Unfortunately, it doesnt always make for a tasty audiophile salad. Thats not to say that My Garden is without its moments of brilliance. On the contrary, as the album opener My Garden as well as track 2 & 3 Gangsta and Crazy are worthy ear-catchers. Walk on Water is pleasing but my money is on Lava for the most memorable track on the album. Lyrically, its the most honest and passionate offering of the 11 tracks.\n\nI feel that this album had the potential to be greater than its outcome. In a day and age where being derivative seems to be a good enough formula, I would much rather hear a unique and bold statement coming from a young artist such as this. Surely, though, this album has enough legs to infiltrate many a dorm room and hair salon throughout the summer of 2015, but Im not sure Kat Dahlia will become a household name just yet. Perhaps, provided that the powers to be don't dispose of her too hastily, she can develop into a truly fine artist with her own unique flag to plant in front of us.","classification":3}

{"text":"There is so much that I have honestly loved about Joe Cocker. Musically, he was one of the underrated but beautiful vocalists I have ever enjoyed listening to on radio. There will be never another soulful giant like he was. Musically as he was going into the 1980's, Joe really was still on the mend from years of drug and alcohol addiction, and his career was derailed for years. But he still had a lot to show from the inside with his voice. The song that really gave Joe Cocker a new generation of fans in the 80's, Up Where We Belong from \"An Officer & A Gentleman,\" remains one of the gifted movie songs that had ever been composed. The song which earned a Oscar back in 1983, is definitely worth listening to each and every time. Joe and Jennifer Warnes really had a lot of chemistry together in the song, and that still clicks today, as it did back in the early to mid 80's. If you honestly had never heard a Joe Cocker song before, well this is one of those tracks that I have absolutely recommended, and I still do. Right up there with Joe in heaven, up where he belongs.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4}

{"text":"I don't know this girl. I know her name, and that she sings the song in question, 'Blah, Blah, Blah' and 'Your Love Is My Drug'.\n\nKesha (not to be mispronounced as Key-shuh) is a pop artist\/budding singing-songwriter who came onto the scenes in late 2009\/early 2010.\n\nAt first, I was highly annoyed with this song. It had no depth, the production was very in-your-face and the song itself seemed to have no good rhythm to it whatsoever.\n\nHOWEVER. After a few listens to it on the radio, I lightened up a little and found that the first thing to grow on me was the production. It's almost irresistable in the way its catchy way flows into you. It's extremely poppy with an electro hint.\n\nOne thing I  totally can't stand about Kesha though is that she talks in her songs instead of sings. It actually works for this song at hand, but for other songs, it gets annoying quickly.\n\nNot that she's the type of artist I can  take seriously yet. She has a song entitled 'Dinosaur'. Anyway, this song isn't a hit out of the park, but it's listenable. At least to me.\n\n3 stars or a 6\/10.","classification":3}

In the Club (5 stars)\n8. This Cage (5 stars)\n9. Merked (3 stars)\n10. Not Guilty (3 stars)\n11. Bout Dat (4 stars - even though I can't stand the hook)\n12. Power to Die (3 stars)\n13. Fight Music (4 stars)\n14. On It (3 stars)\n15. All I Know (5 stars)\n16. Depend On You (2 stars)\n17. Slave to You (4 stars)\n18. Blow My Mind (4 stars)\n19. Who I Be (3 stars)\n20. Murder Swag (3 stars)\n\nOverall 3.7 [Good]\n\nYou will find cameos by Lecrae (who lends a verse to clear the air), Rick Trotter, Conviction (lends some nice vocals to In the club), Brothatone, Cannon, Chris Davis and Roslyn Welch on this album. While there are a lot of tracks that were 3 stars to me they will still end up in my rotation. At the bottom but still there.\n\nWhile I like 'Clear the Air' it felt a little awkward as if there might be some strife about copying Lecrae's style. I sincerely hope this is not the case and that i'm just mistaken.\n\nI recommend redemption to any christian Gospel rap fan. Needless to say, listen to the samples. The album is Good and I'm glad I bought it.","classification":4}

{"text":"Well, she's gone.  It seemed for a time that she would make it back from the hell she was engulfed in.  How sad for everyone who appreciated this hauntingly beautiful, tortured creation.  She was just that--her own creation.  Her influence will echo though music for eternity.  As has been stated elsewhere, we have Adele, Lady Gaga, and Duffy wildly succeeding in the music business due in large part to Ms. Winehouse's influence and the impression she made on the listening public.  I think she paved the way for someone like Lady Gaga to succeed with all her idiosyncrasies and originality intact.  Amy was not one out of the cookie cutter, and she proved that an artist could succeed on the music world's stage looking otherworldly and avant garde, while singing jazz and old school r&b.  She was a true artist in the realest sense of the word.  So sad that we'll never hear her voice serenading us live on a stage again, from her heart to ours...\n\nOn to the review of this cd\/dvd package.  I picked this up at Best Buy a couple of years ago.  I was looking in her section for ANYTHING I could get my hands on--remixes, whatever, and came upon this ltd. edition.  It is a cherished favorite of mine, that I go back to--time and again--to watch the 23 minute documentary that captures many  of the highlights of her videos and onstage performances, giving her a chance to talk about her music, influences, etc, and illuminating her genius and from whence it flows.  She is as self-effacing as ever--raw, unbridled, introspective, insecure, petulant, funny, passionate, but most of all--human.  The documentary is very akin to the one hour doc that was on the dvd , \"I Told You I Was Trouble, Amy Winehouse, Live in London\", but this one appears to have some fresh footage exploring her craft a bit further.  I haven't done a side by side comparison, but watched the one on the concert dvd a couple of nights ago, and this one still seemed fresh to me this morning while viewing it.\n\nThe other portion of the dvd is devoted to 4 performances by Amy at The Orange Lounge--very spare, accompanied only by a guitarist.  They're both sitting down, and it's really interesting to hear her do an unplugged version of \"Rehab\" which really demonstrates the songs amazingly simple structure, along with stunning acoustic renditions of \"Back to Black\", \"You Know I'm No Good\", and \"Love Is a Losing Game\" as well.  These performances are very different from her usual productions with the theatrics of her backup dancers\/singers--here Amy worked her ample magic without all the bells and whistles.  The guy on guitar (sorry, but don't know his name) is obviously very in tune with her every vocal nuance, and it makes for gripping performances of her classics that are unusually scaled back and simple productions.  Her true genius as a singer and songwriter really shines here in the absence of her usual production support.  True Winehouse enthusiasts will want to pick this gem up while they can still get it--I have a feeling that rarities such as this are going to be scarce before long.  This one is truly like having a private concert with Winehouse, as there is no audience in attendance either.  She certainly carved out a niche in music that will reverberate forever.","classification":5}

{"text":"Ill keep it short n sweet, just like the cd.\n\nAll tracks are radio & streaming friendly, the main problems here are theres only 9 songs, the longest one is only 4:20 and the whole cd is just over a half hour.  You won't get bored, just wish it was longer.\n\nMars is proud to cite the influences that shaped his career and this new album:  Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, New Edition, Bobby Brown, Jodeci, Boyz II Men, Teddy Riley and Babyface.  It all comes shining through- its all about having a good time.\n\n24K: pure 80s\/90s Roger & Zapp sound.  Sets the tone for the rest of the party.\n\nChunky: all about dat booty and the women proud of having it like that!\n\nPerm: remember when B-sides were the funkiest cuts?  A true old skool vibe starting out- like James Brown & The Time were jamming together.  And I really liked that rhythm guitar.\n\nThats What I Like: beat reminds you of Bobby Browns Tenderoni.  This ones about treating his baby right with the good life, which is easy since hes already bout dat.\n\nVersace on the Floor: the first slow jam.  Romancing his baby while slow dancing.  Too much high-end synth for a slow joint, but eh- its ok.\n\nStraight Up & Down: your booty deserves a celebration\/Im gonna celebrate it all night long! Ok, my dude.\n\nCalling All My Lovelies: talk about a throwback- this is pure New Edition\/Jodeci\/After 7 sounding stuff.  I got Moesha waiting, Aiesha waiting all the eshas waiting cause I cant get a hold of (places phone call and gets voicemail of HALLE BERRY?!?)  Damn, son.  Thats rough.\n\nFinesse- the beat is real familiar, just cant put my finger on it.  Best I can come up with is Stanley Jordans Street Talk or Sheena Eastons Talk About the Lover in Me.\n\nToo Good to Say Goodbye: pining for a lost love, this one hits all the notes.  Lover, best friend and more- and now you're gone.  Wasnt so much that Babyface needed to co-write it, tho.\n\nIn every sense its over all too soon- songs are a little too short and there should be two or three more.  No trap queen noise here; its all about chilling with your people and your lady- you know, like R&B\/Funk used to be.","classification":4}

With the not so surprising breakup of her and Marc Anthony, many people have wondered if Jennifer could bounce back from this.

After the dissapointments of Brave and her prior singles set for Love?, Fresh Out The Oven & Louboutons fizzled, she has a lot of ground to renew. Her latest single from Love?, I'm Into You isn't really as rhythmic or as driven as she sincerely could've made it. I absolutely was not very impressed with the song, it just wasn't as strong enough as a dance ballad as she could've brought from her own voice.

{"text":"I actually listened to most of this cd yesterday on my way back from class. I thought it was very good, creative, and had great beats. John Legend's also got a great voice, which really shines through some of his mediocre r and b songs. I love it how everybody says he's doign the retro thing. But everybody's doing the retro thing and to me it's just r and b. I think he's one of the best new male r and b artists out there today. I actually really liked his duet with brandy. I loved the melody and I thought Brandy sang really good to be quite honest. If you buy this album you won't be disappointed. It's very good, it has great beats, and some of the songs are intersting and fun to listen it. It also has that feel to it, that it's almost like easygoing jazz in sort of a way.it is different from his previous two albums. I applaud him for trying to do a hip club type song green light.

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5}

I am virtually a newbie, knowing nothing other than Symphony of Destruction and the song accompanied by a video where Dave talks to his multiple personalities. I was blown away! I do not listen to thrash metal. I will listen to this many times. There is exotic guitar work, amazing bass work by Dave Ellefson (sp?) who has a great little showcase on \"Fatal Illusion.\" I highly recommend DYSTOPIA to anyone with good taste in music that is played by actual musicians!

A song about a guy who knows a relationship isn't working out, she's moving on, but he isn't ready to let go. He wants to stay together, closing his eyes to what's going on right behind his back, and not yet accept the inevitable. Great song with some deep meaning.","classification":5}

{"text":"When it has came down to female singers, they sincerely have stopped coming from the heart. For others who have tried hard to make their mark like Jazmine Sullivan, they have not had that full appreciation and respect for the songs they have made. While Jazmine has had some songs that have been a miss recently, like Dumb, she has had a few surprises so well into her songs and her soulful voice as well. Forever Don't Last, the second single from her third album Reality Show, works better with her heart on her sleeve, and a return to the sound that worked very well for her at the first album. The simplicity of her voice reigns on the track nicely, but honestly many feel it isn't interesting, but it is a soulful track for her. If you haven't heard Jazmine Sullivan before, hear this track from the heart.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Jackyly and Jessie James Dupree, but I don't giving 4 or 5 stars just because I like the group or artist. This album here is one of the weakest albums I have heard from Jackyl. No, I am not one of those fans who say the first album was the only good album, far from it, but this album here to me failed to produce those stand out songs that are worthy of being inducted into Jackyls live set, or best of considerations. I consider their last album, \"When moonshine and dynamite collide\" to have much better stand out tracks than this one here.\n\nTo try and prove I'm not just giving this album a low rating because i'm not much into Jackyl, than i'll include previous review ratings.\n\nJackyl (1992)  - ***** (5)\nPush Comes to Shove - ****  (4)\nCut The Crap  - ****  (4)\nRelentless  - ****  (4)\nWhen Moonshine and..- ****  (4)\nStayin' Alive  - ***  (3.5)\n\nSo, I'm not someone who gives Jackyl low scores... even some of those albums fans have rated much lower, but I enjoyed quite a few of the tracks.\nHowever this album failed to produce much at all that stood out and would be a memorable enough song to consider Jackyl adding to live shows and best of's..\n\n1. Best In Show  - Not a great song. **\n2. Encore  - I get where they're going with this, but it could have been better instead of feeling generic. **\n3. Screwdriver  - Probably the best song on the album, but not worthy of much more than 3 stars. ***\n4. Horns Up  - Are they trying anymore? **\n5. Golden Spookytooth  - Easily forgettable.\n6. Cover Of The Rolling Stone - **\n7. Walk My Mile  - **\n8. Favorite Sin  - **\n9. Better Than Chicken  - Weird, but kinda catchy, but still weird. ***\n10. Don't Lay Down On Me  - **\n11. Eleven  - **\nSome of the songs I even felt like Jessie wasn't singing in key, and it made it hard to listen to anymore of those songs.\nBonus Track\n12. It's Tricky  - They could have done a much better job of covering this than they have. **\n\nOverall score. ** (2.5) the lowest score I have given a Jackyl album so far.\nLike I said, some songs sounded like Jessie was singing out of key. A few songs sounded like they where forced out, aka Fillers, and the best of the songs was just enjoying listening to Jackly sing their signature backing vocals loudly to make even some of the weirdest lyrics sound cool. But where is the super stand out songs? This album feels like it is missing the big single, and the 2 extra awesome rocking tracks, and instead give a few left overs and a sore attempt at recreating \"Secret of the bottle\".\n\nSorry, but this album to me is the worst effort from Jackyl so far... well, worst overall album unless you discard the live versions and cover songs from \"Stayin' Alive\" then that would be the worst effort... but this one here only contained one cover song, and it didn't sound like they nailed it enough to make it their very own.\n\nBut, a swing and miss here won't make me say the band have struck out, I'm sure they will come out swinging and hit harder on the next album. So here's to the next album being more fired up than this one.","classification":2}
{"text":"Released simultaneously with the Red Album, The Blue Album spans the band's output from the 1967-70 period.  Despite the fact they only released four albums in that time period, this double album merely touches the tip of the iceberg.  They produced the most influential music in history during that time and songs like \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", \"Penny Lane\", \"Hey Jude\", \"Let It Be\", \"With A Little Help From My Friends\" and \"Something\" aptly show their diversity and brilliance.","classification":5}

{"text":"Leonard Cohen's prior release, 1992's \"The Future\", is one of my favorite albums, so I had extremely high expectations for this. I was not disappointed. The lyrics resonate with new simplicity and clarity. It is as if Cohen stripped away everything hindering communication between him and us. The music, too, has turned inward. Long-time collaborator Sharon Robinson's arrangements are sparse, leaving plenty of room for the words to breathe. The synth-drenched songs give an extreme intimacy, as they are rarely more than undercurrents for voice. Some are reminiscent of spoken word poetry with light baroque music in the background. This fits the songs in its way, but I will be the first to say that a lot of the electronic percussion is rather annoying at times. There are occasional beats and things that simply do not belong on a Cohen album, but it works well for the most part. It's certainly different than before but in a way gives the words even more prominence than they have always had. It can be a bit of surprise at first, as the album starts with electronic ambiance and percussion, Robinson's voice, and, finally, the grave, grave voice of Cohen himself, deeper than ever. This is Cohen's most solipsistic album. As always with him, all tracks are beyond worthwhile, and there are some truly great ones. The opening \"In My Secret Life\" is an instant classic; \"A Thousand Kisses Deep\" is a profound tonal poem; \"Alexandra Leaving\" is perhaps the standout, a brooding masterpiece on which Robinson's voice works wonders along with Cohen's; and closing track \"The Land of Plenty\" is near-spiritual, a truly immaculate song. Fans will truly appreciate this album. It is another great work, another incredible addition to his ouvere, which might indeed be called The Land of Plenty.","classification":5}

{"text":"Apparently Britain knows something us Americans don't... This song is the best thing to come out of dance since 'Canned Heat.' Written by the legendary Elton John, Scissor Sisters single handily bring back the dance scene, if only for a few gay, happy, short minutes. But really folks, you can't get through this song without at least tapping your toes. In fact, Larry Craig probably did his scandalous foot things to this song.\n\nThis song is incredibly catchy, and impossible not to love once you get into it. And the dance factor is cranked up to max here. Whether it be in a closet, or an empty room, or a bar, or a club, rest assured, you'll dance at some point. The vocals, the beats, and the music completely fit the song. And in fact, the structure is perfect for creating all those classic dance vibes.\n\nOverall, a pleasurable experience that really brings back the true dance movement. Not those thumping, trance remixes they put out today, but the quality stuff. So check out this song, you probably haven't heard it here, but it was a huge hit in Britain, so see what you're missing, cause this song is just plain fun.","classification":5}
{"text":"This is actually more like a 4.5, and here's why:\nOf the two widely recognized Isley Brothers slow jam compilations out - this one and 1994's \"Beautiful Ballads\" - both albums have monumental oversights.  One record (this one) is missing \"Choosey Lover\" and \"Don't Say Goodnight\"; the other record (\"Ballads\") is missing their best slow jam and one of the best slow jams ever, \"Sensuality\", as well as \"Groove With You\" and \"For the Love of You\", while replacing it with stuff like \"Caravan of Love\".  And NEITHER album has \"Let Me Down Easy\", but since that's more of a break-up song, you can sort of forgive the oversight.\nSomewhere between these two albums is the best slow jam tape ever made.\nNot that this one doesn't deserve 4.5 or even 5 stars despite this.  The other CD was lacking, in that it had items on it that weren't exactly ballad-like to compensate(!) for the above omissions.  This one is still a solid, 100% CD in and of itself that you never have to hit the \"Next Track\" button on.  it doesn't break mood, doesn't insert a jumpy dance groove in the middle of the rotation...it's exactly what it says it is and is exactly the way you want it to be.  It's practically been laid out with the ebb and flow of a night with your lover in mind.\nOf the two albums, this one is superior, despite its own grievous ommissions.","classification":5}

She used to just sit in tub watching TV, and I would sing while washing her. Now, I play this and have to have duck ready to squeeze along with song, and it was fascinating to watch her make the connection between words & sounds in song, and her tubby and duck!

{"text":"Amy has a very strong and distinctive voice, which is refreshing to hear since most of the female artists who are out today sound the same to me. However, her voice sounded the same in most of the songs, not a lot of variation. The songs on \"Black To Back\" are a combination of jazz, soul, raggae, and Mowntown- genres that I like. Yes, it's \"different\" than what's already out there *today*, yet it sounds the same as the music that came out during the 60s. Not that that's a bad thing, the CD is good, but I wasn't blown away by it. Amy should develop her own signature style to incorporate into the genres she likes. If she had her own style, people wouldn't compare her to Lauryn Hill and Billie Holiday. In conclusion, good CD, different than the norm, better than Xtina's album, but nothing NEW either. But I have to keep it real, if a black female artist had come out with this album, she wouldn't be heavily promoted and no one would be making a fuss about how \"amazing\" she is, unless she decided to go mainstream and sing half nude.

{"text":"This is less of a final goodbye from Pink Floyd and more of an Epilogue. The package is extensive with Blu-ray DVD, 5.1 surround (an absolute must for any Pink Floyd Fan), a 24-page booklet and 3 large postcards.\n\nBut it's the music that makes the point here. Culminated from over 20 hours of 'lost' or unused material from, \"The Division Bell\", it winds its way over eighteen songs, 6 video tracks and 3 audio tracks. It progresses with a tepid, but never boring pace. Throughout, you will hear what might be considered 'outtakes' from \"The Division Bell\" and other albums. In fact, there are obvious 'bridges' and 'transitions' sections that seem to have re-emerged from nearly all the Pink Floyd albums since the seventies.\n\nSometimes the sound is ethereal, moody and dream-like. At other times, it seems to start to rise into what might be a powerful culmination of musical excess, but it never quite seems to. That maybe the entire point of the album. It's a collection of reworked and re-imagined musical artwork that finally made it to the public's ears.\n\nRoger Waters influence seems to truly be lost here, but with the help in 2014 of David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright, the magic is re-released. Gilmour's guitar takes hold whenever heard, but gives way to the famous ethereal and rocking keyboard work of albums past. Whether rock, jazz or standard fare, the drumming continues to be a staple of the work - sometimes there and sometimes sneaking in and out, much like many of the instruments on this collection. There's something about hearing the old saxophone that really brings out the old Pink Floyd ambience along with a gently grinding organ\/keyboard. Whatever seems to be lacking here is more than made up in other ways.\n\nBeing almost an entirely instrumental of piece of work, Pink Floyd ends it with a magnificent song, the only one with lyrics, written by Polly Samson. The album begs several listens, as the layered work is typical of any former Pink Floyd album, but this one seems to call back from the past some amazing sounds, acoustics, feelings and that lost stoned teenager in all of us.  Pink Floyd's muisc will always be around - endless.","classification":5}

There is a joyous and deepness from when you hear the song from John so brilliantly that really stands strong today, from the piano and soulfulness of the serene words.

{"text":"It's surprising how many classic Christmas LPs have never been re-mastered for conversion to CD, none more so than Christmas Carols by Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra which first came out in 1958 as mono Dot 3148 containing: White Christmas; It Came Upon A Midnight Clear; O Holy Night; Deck The Halls; The First Noel; Joy To The World; Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful); Silent Night; God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen; O Tannenbaum (O Christmas Tree); Hark! The Herald Angels Sing; Faith Of Our Fathers; Jingle Bells; O Little Town Of Bethlehem.\n\nOver the years with subsequent reissues there were 3 different covers with the original having a mostly yellow cover and a stylized drawing of a sleigh inside a large red oval (which made it a bit odd in that Sleigh Ride itself was not among the tracks). In 1959 the same album came out in stereo (Dot 3148\/25148), with a glossy front cover, \"Billy Vaughn\" in white on a green background and gold-embossed \"Christmas Carols\" on red, with a gold embossed border. When re-issued again a few years later the cover was a flat red, the \"Dot\" logo in its usual 3 colors situated in a green circle, \"Billy Vaughn\" in white and \"Christmas Carols\" in yellow. Charting-wise it made it to # 145 on Billboard's Christmas charts in 1962 and # 101 in 1967.\n\nSome of the tracks have appeared on these CDs: Christmas With Billy Vaughn & His Yuletide Orchestra - 9 of the same tracks in a 10-track 2006 release that includes Auld Lang Syne; Christmas Classics, a 1996 release from Chicago Music Company that contains the same 10 sides; and Christmas Song, a 2012 release from Essential Media Group containing the same line-up. None of these include God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen or White Christmas, nor can I say with any certainty that they are all the same original 1958 renditions.\n\nWhy that has never been re-mastered for CD is a puzzle since Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra wasn't just some run-of-the-mill band back then. After being part of the highly-successful Dot vocal quartet known as The Hilltoppers, who had 15 hit singles for the label from 1952 to 1954, he left to form the in-house Dot orchestra in 1954 that would go on to back the vast majority of Dot artists on so many hit singles and albums (e.g. Pat Boone, Gail Storm, The Fontane Sisters, Tab Hunter, Nick Todd (Pat Boone's brother), and many more for years to come.\n\nIn the midst of all that, he and his orchestra would rack up some 31 hit singles of their own from their first, Melody Of Love in late 1954\/early 1955, to their last in 1967, I Love You (And You Love Me), while selling albums in the millions, 4 of which went Gold: The Golden Instrumentals (1956); Sail Along Silv'ry Moon (1958); Blue Hawaii (1959); and Theme From A Summer Place (1960).\n\nA great deal of his music is available on CD, so why are they dragging their heels with his premier Christmas album?","classification":5}

But sadly, the problem with Beyonce' Knowles is that she has been more of a product, trying to severely overexpose her music, and not give better in her own work overall, by putting patience and time to find better. When I had heard she was going to pull out a \"surprise record\" back in 2013, I was honestly not interested in stunts without listening to the voice at heart. Sadly, she really did not push herself better into her own work for her self-titled Beyonce' record in 2013, she just instead overdid herself and fell apart at the seems. most of the tracks have really been poorly prepared, and shown no growth in her soul. XO is honestly one of those songs that doesn't flow as a ballad. I really found it to be weaker than her past works like Flaws In All and Listen from Dreamgirls back in 2006. I really found this song to be a bust at soul overall.

{"text":"It had been some years by this point since Stanley Clarke had done a studio album under his own name. Looking to embrace the flavors of both his fusion years and modern smooth jazz Stanley,for the most finds a good balance between the two. After a lot of smooth jazz does need a stronger musical element to keep it from sounding muzaky. Interesting enough there is a concentration here,both literally and figuratively on Stanley's soundtrack work as the excellent slow jazz-funk groove of \"Justice's Groove\" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Poetic-Justice\/dp\/0767821955\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Poetic Justice<\/a>&nbsp;and the mellow \"Theme From Boyz N The Hood\". It's Stanley's bass by the way that keeps the song from becomming boring after a time. \"Fantasy Love\" tries to do a Howard Hewett duet-type song again in the spirit of \"Heaven Sent You\" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Time-Exposure\/dp\/B0000025V9\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Time Exposure<\/a>&nbsp;a decade earlier but,in my opinion doesn't suceed quite as well because there's little to no groove to the song really and it does tend to be somewhat over produced. Much better are \"Zabadoobeede? (Yabadoobeeda!)\" and \"I'm Home Africa\" which create a potent,dancable mix of jazz-funk and the percussive sounds of the motherland;holding true to an afrocentric element that,while well explored during Stanley's musical peak he had somehow neglected to fully embrace at that time. Well better late than never and it all works very well. The title cut is a good song with a decent groove to it but it brings to mind another unfortunate element of this album,one that is present on the movie themes as well. The sax solos by George Howard and Gerald Albright are very weak,even for smooth jazz quality and that is the reason I deduct one star from this otherwise really fine quality album. \"Christmas In Rio\" is actually really nice and breezy considering how much deep bass playing there is on it with a nice \"heavy on easy\" quality. \"What If I Forget The Champagne\" and \"Never Lose Your Heart\/There Lies The Passion\" are instrumentals that focus and as with \"Christmas In Rio\" there is some fine solos from guests Andy Summers,Jean Luck Ponty and Kenny Kirkland. There is a Sting element to these songs and,considering his recent work with Stewart Copeland in Animal Logic that was actually very appropriate. On \"Illegal\" and \"Lord Of The Low Frequencies\" Stanley gets a chance to focus on what he does best-bass playing and delivers some of his finest work in that arena on these stripped down,somewhat afro-funk type jams. George Duke shows up for the foot stomping flat out funk closer \"Funk Is It's Own Reward\";for the 70's funk fan this will likely be one of the more appealing. With the exception of the afformentioned weak sax playing on a couple of the tracks this album was actually one of Stanley's better comeback recordings and comes highly recommended.","classification":4}

{"text":"This is the long awaited follow up to \"life is killing me\", and it was well worth it.  This is on their new lable SPV, who did a masterful packageing deal with their lyrics being layed out in a cross fold out booklet.  Enough about the exterior, this album dredges up sounds reminiscnet of Slow Deep and Hard and Bloody Kisses Smashed together and angrier than ever. The album has 10 tracks and clocks in at a dredging 77 minutes of Highs and Lows.  Personal favorite tracks are \"Tripping A Blind Man\", \"Some Stupid Tomorrow\", and the best track for me \"Ode To Locksmiths\"  a fast and swinging ditty that even dredges memories of Carnivore.  There are two tracks that move in at 10 plus minutes (Profit of Doom, and These Three Things).  These tracks have about 3-4 tempo changes each and would make for great live tracks.  Halloween in Heaven, Dead Again, and Some Stupid Tomorrow will likely be good candidates for singles to push radio play of the group, being the shorter tracks on the album.  Finally, the track September Sun is a close second for my favorite track, a slow burner that is ballad like in only a haunting type o negative way.  The album is mixed brilliantly, just a great venture for these guys.  Buy this album, good intro to the band, and a must for fans.\n\nFYI: for those of you curious about the 5 live tracks available at a large retail store, The CD clocks in at around 44 minutes, and has the tracks Everything Dies\/ My Girlfriends Girlfriend, Are you Afraid\/Gravitational Constant, Christian Women, Love you to Death, and Black Number One.

The relatively strong sound of the musical arrangement stands in sharp contrast to a cry for help with life's problems. The band harmonizes to perfection; and I love those drums and guitars! Awesome--great key changes, too!\n\n\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\" gives us a ballad that features John Lennon singing of his pain after a breakup with his girlfriend. He knows people don't want to be around him if he's miserable; but he also knows his pain is just too great for him to pretend that he's happy. The guitars and percussion work wonders for the arrangement; and they mark the beat rather well, too. \"You're Gonna Lose That Girl\" again features the band harmonizing beautifully about the importance of a man treating his girlfriend well to keep their love alive; and \"Ticket To Ride\" rocks awesomely as the band sings of their pain because a woman they love is leaving them. The melody gets strength from solid guitar playing, percussion and drums. Impressive tempo changes, too!\n\n\"I've Just Seen A Face\" sports an excellent guitar arrangement and the tempo changes enhance this number. Paul sings \"I've Just Seen A Face\" flawlessly; and when John comes in the number only gets better! The band jams really well on this number. \"Yesterday\" is another highlight of this album; Paul sings this with sensitivity, heart and soul. The strings are beautiful and the guitars help, too. \"Yesterday,\" a classic, tender and mournful love ballad covered by countless other artists over the years, remains one of the greatest hits for The Beatles ever.\n\nThe CD closes with a strong number called \"Dizzy Miss Lizzie.\" The band jams really hard and you can tell by a cry or two (or three) that they're having fun with this number. John sings this without a superfluous note; he wants Lizzie to be his girlfriend. Listen for some strong electric guitars on \"Dizzy Miss Lizzie.\"\n\nThe liner notes include black and white photos of the band members; and we also get the song credits. I like the cover artwork as well.\n\nThe Beatles were unlike any other rock band--ever. Help! is just one of many albums that proves their remarkable creativity and genius; and with any luck people will continue to enjoy their music for ages to come.\n\nThanks forever, guys!!!","classification":5}

{"text":"This one takes a few listens. For me, it was the Tibetan percussion, the subtle influences that whispered a piety of thinking that have won me over for this record, and in that regard, this one reminds me very much of his early work. In his self-deprecating liner notes, Cockburn states he had in mind a noisy project, an index of Canadian metals perhaps, and came up with this. Some index, eh? The instrumentals all play to his strengths and his influences and remind you also just what an amazing luthier Linda Manzer is. If you can not abide 5 instrumentals, more's the pity. Justin Bieber may be just your ticket. The guitar sounds great on this record. His sense of humour on Called Me Back, his genuine compassion and sorrow on Each One Lost, and his sense of the impermanence, even of love, on The Iris Of The World ring with heart breaking authority. They cut to the chase with humour, sadness and intimacy with a genuine urgency, a sese that time is short, call now.\nThis disc is a departure from records like You've Never Seen Everything, Call Now, even the Slice o Life and Speechless releases. There is a feel to it that reminds me more of the period from Sun Wheel Dance through Circles In The Stream and would fit right in, but for a few historical references, with that trajectory. In a sense then, while he isn't going back, he is returning to something from a different stream than he's waded through in a while. His collaborators in this project are all terrific, notably Colin Linden and Jenny Scheinman. It would be great were he to tour with a band with these folks on board.\n\nNote to Bruce: Songs about Richard Nixon are too late in 2011. And it's off the mark anyway. I used to bump into Richard, walking around Daylesford on a visit to his daughter. Inspite of the continued SS presence, I found him approachable, forthcoming about his own character flaws that brought him down, in short, maybe more Shakespearean than Shakespeare could have imagined. He certainly had a sense that he'd re-written Lear and RIII. Not exactly the clueless power monger in Rose. I think Neil got it right, \"even RN has got it - soul.\" Now, Reagan on the other hand... there karma kicked in. Decades of being the vehicle that destroyed lives came back to him in a final ten years curled in a self-decaying ball. There's a song there somewhere.","classification":4}

{"text":"The backstory of this set has happened over and over again as people really do find boxes of tapes of vintage Grateful Dead shows in storage and for some strange reasons they are delivered to the band's doorstep in Marin County. When Dave got his hands on this box of tapes of complete shows from late 1969 and early 1970 he had found lost treasure and he was wise enough to share his booty with other misfits that live for this sorta adventure.\n\nAn interesting thing is presented over the course of 4 CD's as many tunes are found here that are played in each night of live music performed and now we are able to compare just what happens from night to night with the same song. There are two different versions of: \"Hard To Handle\" \"New Speedway Boogie\" \"Lovelight\" \"Black Peter\" \"China>Rider\" \"Good Lovin\" \"Cumberland Blues\" \"St. Stephen\" & \"Dark Star.\" A new song (that was only played a handful of times) is featured on this set three times and that one is entitled: \"Mason's Children.\"\n\nDISC ONE: This St. Louis set of 2\/2\/70 is an amazing find as Jerry Garcia has the turbos going in full force and is playing like he was glued to his guitar. Somehow, I know if a \"Dark Star\" is gonna be a favorite of mine right from the opening notes and with this one it happened again. This: \"Dark Star\" is a very pretty one and there are some delicate lines played with Phil and Bobby countering perfectly every note Jerry plays. \"Dark Star\" isn't the only reason that Dave picked this show but it's a stunning center piece in St. Louis in 1970. The only crowd noise I detected early on here was a cheer that goes up with the opening notes of: \"St. Stephen\" and I found this fan favorite to be slightly off and I had my answer why it was different when it suddenly blasted perfectly smack into: \"Mason's Children\" before it had arrived at it's normal ending. We got lucky with this treasure being found as this is a classic night from 43 years past.\n\nDISC TWO: The ending of the St. Louis show and we are back in San Francisco for a Fillmore West show from 12\/20\/69. Pigpen tells you to: \"Get yer' hands outta yer' pockets\" in fine fashion and a touch of gospel sends the happy hippies of the Midwest home to dream about all of this and then it's back to the city by the bay. \"Dark Star\" is good this time up but St. Louis got the better one. \"St. Stephen>The Eleven\" is a monster and again it's Jerry playing every note in the book with the power of a forest fire and it's great to hear huge lightning bolts of energy from these youngsters.\n\nDISC THREE: Pure Pigpen for your pleasure! The huge (35 minute) \"Lovelight\" is Pigpen's spotlight and this will soon be regarded by all that witness it as one of Pigpen's finest moments. \"China Cat>Rider\" is fine but what I would like to see is the look of some of the hippies faces when the band played \"High Time\" and \"Me And My Uncle\" as there is no way that they could have expected these romps through the rodeo while trippin' on Orange Sunshine.\n\nBONUS DISC: Some folks didn't get one of these and they missed out as it's my favorite of the 4 CD's found here. \"Smokestack>New Speedway Boogie\" is a wonderful pairing done proper as the band is turning on a dime making big things...Well...BIGGER! A sweet: \"Dire Wolf\" is one of the best I have heard and if there is such a thing as \"Acid-Folk\" it would sound like this in your head. \"Black Peter\" is again so fine to my ears it is very welcome to hear two fantastic Peter's played so close together from these special times. The meat of the Bonus Disc is this version of: \"The Other One\" that goes right in Dark Star territories like a pyscho-safari looking for the biggest game.\n\nThe Packaging: The cover of the Bonus Disc sure does look like a tee-shirt to me and I hope to see it over at the band's official website real soon. The essays from Tom Constanten and Dave are excellent and the story of the tapes is included in great detail. The newspaper clippings added to the flavor of the times in right good fashion.\n\nThis set sold out faster than anything that came before and it's contents are golden.\nFIVE STARS!!!","classification":5}

{"text":"The music harmonizes this world\nAnd give us taste of life\n\nStarting to describe Cadence Spalding's debut album it is difficult to avoid the comparison of her manner with the singing with Enya. Flaring polyphony vocals, strong celtic flavor - all these are present in the project \"Save the World\". But no doubt Cadence Spalding has her unique style which stirs the soul while listening to this truly outstanding work. But what features make the album \"Save the World\" so particular?\n\nThe first reason is that great love is splashed out with Cadence Spalding's delicate singing. You just float in the aerial harmonies of her enchanting vocals. She is very close to you, so it seems you can simply stretch your hand and gently touch her. And your heart begins to pulse in unison with this divine music.\n\nSecondly I want to point out the perfect sound of the album \"Save the World\". And this is not accidental because this CD\/DVD was produced by Mars Lasar whose firm handwriting is impossible to confuse with anything. The images on the DVD are delightful.\n\nThe album \"Save the World\" should be listened to as a single whole. But my particular choice are the compositions in which Cadence Spalding's voice are fully intertwined with refined, very smooth and at the same time slightly jazzy Mars Lasar's sound. I'd like to mention the songs \"I Do\" and \"Share Your Life\" in this connection. In addition to that Mars Lasar masterfully interweaves ethnic motives and adds strong rhythmic pattern to his music.\n\nOne wants to say many praising words about the album \"Save the World\". This is music for future people who won't be divided by any borders and barriers. This is the voice of a united world.\n\nWhat more can be said? \"Save the World\" is a bright debut and it must be continued.\n\nSerge Kozlovsky\n[...]","classification":5}

If you like his style already you'll love this album.  If you need good beautiful powerful music that will bring back memories of musicals such as Willy Wonka or even Sweeney Todd then this is a great addition to your music collection.  I never thought I'd find myself listening to Josh Groban, but here I am and proud of it.  Other men who claim false masculinity against this type of music are fake men.

{"text":"1-6: OP, p; MJ, vib; Ray Brown, b; Ed Thigpen, dr.\n7-8. Same minus MJ.\n9: MJ, vib; Joe Newman, tpt; Jimmy Cleveland, tbn; Julian Cannonball Adderley, alto sx; Frank Foster, ten sx; Sahib Shihab, bari sx; Horace Silver, p; Percy Heath, b; Art Blakey, dr; Quincy Jones, arr.\n\nWith the exception of cuts 7-8, two takes of the Oscar Peterson Trio captured live playing On Green Dolphin Street, these are cuts from two of my favorite vinyl recordings of the late fifties (cut 9) and very early sixties (cuts 1-6).\n\nOn the Very Tall cuts, Peterson and Jackson play together with the rock firm rhythm section of bassist Brown and drummer Thigpen, and they all play in the same direction. That wasn't a certainty with the Peterson of that day, who (in my opinion) tended to over-embellish when he played, using too many notes and churning up aa funky, bluesy feeling that felt ersatz, not real at times. Here probably because he was playing with the real thing in Jacksonhe swings more directly. His solos are clean, not cluttered. Jackson is as always sheer pleasure: the guy did ballads as well as he did bop lines and blues, an all-purpose musical master. These four guys sound like they were having fun. Of the six songs from the original album, two are blues or bluesy (the second is John Browns Body, a funky remake of The Battle Hymn of the Republic), a third is an up-tempo rendition of Dolphin, the fourth a ballad Heartstrings, fifth Nat Adderleys funkmeister Work Song, and last and least successful, a -time rendition of A Wonderful Guy. Then come the true trio cuts of Dolphin. And then a mid-sized band version of Heartstrings again, from Jacksons most successful album of the 50s, Plenty, Plenty Soul. It features an absolutely stunning presentation of the theme by Jackson, followed by a lovely solo ditto, and then another gem of a solo by Cannonball Adderley on alto.\n\nIt might have been nice to have more variety in songs played three versions of Dolphin, two of Heartstringsbut when the music being played is of this high a quality, who cares? This isn't an essential album but its a very good one, which shows what old pros can do when they convene just to groove together.","classification":4}

With the shocking news of the passing of Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, it is just another tragic reminder of Rock & Roll excess from drugs, alcohol and depression. It is just a tragic reminder of how very fragile someone's life can really be from beginning to end. Soundgarden really was more of a underrated band in the realm's of grunge music's legacy. Where as the case with Pearl Jam & Nirvana being looked upon as music legends. But Chris Cornell did show a sincere voice with a very fragile heart at the soul. That is the case with some of Soundgarden's masterpieces, and Black Hole Sun has remained the Soundgarden opus that many fans will continue to come back to. The song has been a very deep hard rock delight at despair, sorrow and prayer at the soul of the rifts by the guitar. If you have honestly never heard a Soundgarden song before, this should be the first and the last one that you should go back to each time.\n\nSong: B\n\nChris Cornell: 1964-2017","classification":4}

{"text":"Another bumper album at bargain price from Amazon, the second in a week! Amazon seem to be listening to the comments of reviewers who prefer full versions of pieces rather than \"greatest hits\" movements that leave you frustrated. I think I have all of these pieces in one version or another (sometimes several versions) and thought twice about downloading more onto my rapidly filling hard drive, the price, however, made  up my mind - what is there to lose? 99c at todays price? I knew some of the artists from other downloads and some (the Gabrieli Quartet in particular from a favourite recording of the Brahms Clarinet Quintet with a different  clarinetist, Keith Puddy - not David Smith.\nNow for the music - a  wide selection of  favourite and not so well-known pieces, often pairs (of symphonies, concertos,divertimentos, quartets\/quintets, piano sonaatas) that provide good balances of performers and genres and make the package very listenable on \"play all the way through\" basis.\n\nLet me start by saying how much I enjoyed Carmen Piazzini's Turkish March Sonata - interestingly played with lots of variation and playfulness. Her performance of the C majot concerto is also very pleasing, she plays with dexterity and grace - avoiding the temptation to play the \"Elvira Madigan\" slow movement as if it were Rachmaninov! The piano is well recorded and the orchestra set in a nice natural acoustic - just enough reverberation to sound like a real concert hall (which indeed it might have been).\n\nShame on Amazon for duplicating the second \"Haydn\" quartet - which was included in last weeks \"Autumn\" collection. It's good though that they included a second quartet, the 6th of the \"Haydn\" quartets, known as the \"Dissonance\" from the way the piece begins - wandering around before settling into a more traditional tonality. This is nicely recorded, the instruments well placed across the aural stage. Both of these are tasters for the Salzberg Mozarteum's recording of all 6 quartets&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mozart-The-Haydn-Quartets\/dp\/B0030MLIGK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mozart: The Haydn Quartets<\/a>. Shame too on the duplication of the D minor piano concerto, also included in last week's autumn collection - although nicely played by Roberte Mamou with the Berlin Symphony Orchestra under Gerard Oskamp.\n\nLike the piano concertos we are also treated to two violin concertos, again using different performers. Emmy Verhey plays the 3rd concerto with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra under Eduardo Marturet (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mozart-Violin-Concertos-and-Symphonies\/dp\/B00534LH9G\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mozart: Violin Concertos and Symphonies<\/a>and Michail Gantvarg plays No. 5 with and directs the St. Petersburg Soloists. (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mozart-The-Complete-Violin-Concertos\/dp\/B001U1MK60\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mozart: The Complete Violin Concertos<\/a>. I must say that prefer the latter - smaller forces and a lighter and tighter approach to the music.\n\nAs befitting such a prolific symphonist we are treated to four of Mozart's symphonies, three (38, 40 and 41) well known and one, (no. 25) less well known. These are all played by the same band - the Sud West Rundfunk symphony Orchestra, led by Ernest Bour. These are workmanlike and competent performances that are not stand-out must-have recordings but which can hold their head up in this bargain-price context. I liked the no. 25 best, probably because I knew it least well, but there are parts of the others that also stood out - like the slow movement of no. 40.\n\nAnother stand-out performance in this package is the \"Gran Partita\" a wall-of-sound wind serenade that is beautifully played by the wind sections of the Slovak Philharmonic Orchestra under Zdenek Kosler. The band play with excellent ensemble - very important in the fast final movement and the recording is not too close, so we don't get too much key clattering, which can be a curse in these massed wind pieces.\n\nWind instruments are well represented in the concertos (for horn, flute (plus harp) and clarinet) and in the flute quartet and clarinet quintet. I especially enjoyed the latter - the clrinet has been recorded as prt of the emsemble rather than a stand alone solo instrument - which suits the piece and allows the solo passages from the strings to be heard in a democratic context.\n\nArife Glsen Tatu's performance of the 1st flute concerto was even more of a delight, especially his cadenza at the end of the first movement. this is a fine recording, not just in the flute playing but also in the way the engineers have managed to get a broad range of tone across the orchestra, with some lovely bass notes that contrast well with the soaring flute and the shimmering strings. The Salzburg Soloists are a real band with an impressive track record of performance and recording since their inception in 1991; including, for a while, the artistic direction of Boris Belkin. I realise that this  recording is a duplicate from the \"99 Spring Essentials\" album, but I'm not complaining as I somehow didn't listen to it properly when that came out.\n\nMichail Gantvag steps aside from his violinist solo duties with the St. Petersburg soloists to direct (from the first fiddle position?)the Clarinet concerto with Igor Prashchuk - playing with great fluidity, rich tone and a lightness of touch that matches the orchestra's attention to small details. This is not Brymer\/Beecham but a satisfying recording.\n\nPeter Jancovic and Renata Modron join the SWR Symphony Orchestra and Ernest Bour to play the flute and harp concerto. This is a performance that will not dissappoint those who know the piece and will convert those who don't. Mozart didn't particularly like the flute it seems - it was a very different instrument in his day, demanding more skill to play in tune, yet he wrote concertos and chamber pieces that enchant, and  - in the case of this concerto - provides a template for musical combinations of flute and harp that have proved very popular, especially in French music. Jancociv is the flautist and plays skilfully if not with a great range of emotional expression. The recording places him too much at the front so that there is a dominance over the harp that spoils the balance at times when the harp needs more exposure.\n\nJoze Falout, Camerata Labacensis and Kurt Redel play the 3rd Horn Concerto. Camerata Labacensis is apparently a chamber orchestra consisting primarily of soloists from the RTV Slovenia Symphony Orchestra. Falout has a warm accurate tone and is set appropropriately in the recording - not too close - not too far. I liked his short cadenza at the end of the first movement and the spritely third movement.\n\nI have loved Mozart's requiem since singing it at school, way way back. So I come to recordings with strong views as to how I like it to sound - light rather than dramatic alto part and rich bass soloist, not turgid. This recording gets off to a good start with it's measured onward flow of orchestra and choir. It's recorded in a fairly lively acoustic, fitting for a church piece, but not the kind of reverberation that reminds one more of the bathroom than the cathedral! The choir sounds large but has cohesion and washes over you in waves of tight ensemble and nicely varied emotional expression. There is direction and energy to the Dies Irae that befits it dramatic reference to the Day of Judgement, even though we are being taken there at great pace, mitigated by the entry of the horn and bass in \"tuba mirem\" followed by each soloist in turn - reminiscent of the great quartets in Beethoven's Fidelio and Mozart's Marriage of Figaro. This is nicely sung, with top marks going to the soprano (Magdalena Hajossyova?) for simply beautiful unaffected singing.\nThe sublime entry of the orchestra in the recordare takes us to another quartet, showing some of the weaknesses in the tenor's tone and the (imho) rather dramatic tone of the alto. The recording doesn't allow the soloists to hide and I would give them high marks for ensemble, accuracy and expression.\nI shan't go through all the other movements except to say how much I appreciated the conductors sense of steady movement and pulse, the rises and falls of drama and emotion.\nThis is the complete Naxos recording, without the Exultate Jubilate filler. (which you can download for 89c from [[ASIN:B005IHEUB0 01 Exsultate-Jubilate] - the naxos complete would cost $7.99!\n\nThis is a fine selection and certainly worth the bargain price of 99c being sought as today's disc of the day. It will probably rise to 6.99 in a few days - so get in quick!","classification":5}

{"text":"Before I get into the critical aspects of this album, let me say this: this is NOT country music.  This is rock music.  There is NOTHING on this CD that is in any way connected to country music.  Calling this country music shows a lack of both knowledge of and respect for country music and its rich history.\n\nLike a lot of music that is put out and marketed as \"country\" (I'm looking at you Taylor Swift), this is what I like to call turkey bacon.  I'm sure everyone's had turkey bacon.  It's turkey flavored, cut, and cooked like bacon.  And turkey is great! I love turkey.  But cutting it and cooking it differently doesn't change the fact that it is turkey, not bacon.  Bacon is pork.\n\nAnd this album is rock...not country.  The marketers and industry executives have tried to tell people differently, but there are those of us who love and respect country music enough not to fall for it.\n\nNone of this is to say rock is a bad thing.  Just like turkey, I like rock music.  Country is my favorite, but there's a lot of good rock music out there.  But FGL isn't even good rock music.  By all accounts, it's just terrible music altogether.  It's boring, unoriginal, unimaginative.\n\nHonestly, take a good hard listen to the lyrics of \"Cruise.\" And \"Get Your Shine On\"?  Honestly?  This is the best this group has to offer.  It's things like this that have basically made listening to country radio unbearable.  While these two are busy making hits by singing about nothing, a duo that actually makes quality music (Halfway to Hazard) falls by the wayside.  I bet most FGL fans have never even heard of Jason Isbell.\n\nThis album is just more mass-produced garbage.  And the public eats it up and turns it into hits, guaranteeing that these two guys aren't going away anytime soon.\n\nGeorge Jones must be rolling over in his grave.","classification":1}

{"text":"George Benson \"(born March 22, 1943) is a ten time Grammy Award winning American musician whose production career began at the age of twenty-one as a jazz guitarist. Benson first came to prominence in the 1960s playing soul jazz with the likes of Jack McDuff. Benson then launched a successful solo career, alternating between jazz, pop, R&B singing, and scat singing. This one-time child prodigy topped the Billboard 200 in 1976 with the triple-platinum album, `Breezin.' He was also a major live attraction in the UK during the 1980s and continues to attract a large following today.\"\n\nThese five tracks display George Benson's great talent; this music is really good! \"On Broadway\" has a terrific beat and George sings this with lots of genuine passion. There's also the hauntingly beautiful \"This Masquerade;\" I could never tire of hearing George perform this song and no one could ever do it better than George does! \"Turn Your Love Around\" picks up the tempo a bit and this catchy tune still gets lots of airplay today. \"Turn Your Love Around\" is an excellent song. \"Breezin'\" is very well done and the track set ends with George Benson performing \"Give Me the Night.\" Give Me the Night\" just plain sounds good and I always like to hear this number.\n\nGeorge Benson is a brilliant artist and hopefully he will perform for many years to come. Diehard fans will likely have these songs so this music is best suited for the casual fan or relative newcomers just discovering George Benson. I highly recommend his music.","classification":5}

{"text":"I remember the first time I heard Casting Crowns on the radio several years ago. It wasn't Mark Hall's voice, the band's music, or even the harmonies sung that drew me in. It was the lyrics. I was going through a situation that \"Voice of Truth\" so eloquently and accurately addressed. I honestly felt the Lord meant for me to hear that song at that particular time. I decided to go ahead and buy that album and found every song spoke volumes to me. Now here we are 3 albums later and once again, Mark and his amazing ensemble of musicians have done it again. They have put together an album that speaks volumes to my heart.\n\nI really like the way that Casting Crowns' albums generally have a theme. This album is no exception. I find the theme throughout this album is about staying in our comfort zone also known as the middle ground- the safety zone. But he also addresses the middle as in the 'gray area' which we all have to deal with on a daily basis no doubt. Mark sings about how we all have good intentions but when it comes to stepping out of our comfort zone for God we say...'no way!'. We give God a list that says I'll do this and this but there is no way I can or will do that or that. Fear is usually the biggest reason most of us don't step out of our comfort zone. I am in no way pointing a finger because I find I am probably the guiltiest of all at doing this. That said, this album truly helps me to understand why I do what I do and how to remedy it. It inspires me to seek out the Lord in His Word and in prayer and meditation.\n\nThe first song on the album: \"What This World Needs\" is a great way to start off the album. It has a rocky edge that draws you in to its chorus and before you know it you are singing along. I actually had to listen to this song several times before I could fully appreciate what Mark was trying to say.\n\nSong #2: Every Man- This song references the fact that no matter who we are or what we've done there is Hope for us. Hope comes in the form of Jesus Who knows how we feel and can understand what we are going through.\n\n#3: Slow Fade- This is an amazing song that helps us realize that no one goes from being on fire for the Lord to dabbling with sin in one day. No, instead it is a slow fade. Satan knows the best attack is a gradual attack which makes black and white fade into gray.\n\n#4: East to West- One of my favorites on this album. This is one of the songs on this album that speaks to me personally. It is with songs like this that I wonder if maybe God isn't giving Mark a look into my heart. (As if I'm the only one struggling with issues like this. ;-) )\n\n#5: The Word Is Alive- As the title indicates, this song is about the Bible and how It brings forth hope to the hopeless and frail.\n\n#6: The Altar and the Door- One of my favorites also. \"The Altar and the Door\" musically has a lot to offer. It is very upbeat and easy to sing along with. This song is one of the many that teaches about how we get caught in the middle and lose our follow through between the altar and the door. I believe we all are guilty of this at some point in our walk with the Lord.\n\n#7: Somewhere in the Middle- This is my absolute favorite song on the album for several reasons. One of which is that this song is easy to sing along with and secondly, because it is such a deep song that carries a great amount of meaning. I really think it should be my \"anthem\". I admire Mark's clever word play- \"Fearless warriors on a picket fence, Reckless abandon wrapped in common sense, deep-water faith in the shallow end, We are caught in the middle with eyes wide open to the differences, The God we want and the God who is...\" What Mark illustrates here is how contrary and fickle we as the body of Christ can be. We know right from wrong and we know how to discern truth from fiction, but yet we stay in the middle ground where it is safe and easy instead of standing up for what is right...which reminds me of the great story of the three young men thrown into the fiery furnace.\n\n#8: I Know You're There: This song is great! One of the ladies from Casting Crowns sings this. She does a terrific job and is able to carry her own without any problem. This song is about knowing that God is always there for us.\n\n#9: Prayer for a Friend: This song, which sounds close to a ballad, is about those we are closest to getting caught up in the world and we want nothing more than to bring them back to the Lord.\n\n#10: All Because of Jesus: This is a praise and worship song that I think will one day be sung in churches all over the world.\n\n#11: White Dove: This song is completely different from anything Casting Crowns has ever done. I am not a big fan of it though I have to applaud them for trying something different.\n\nI highly recommend this album to anyone who worships with music. I also recommend it to anyone who is feeling lost in this big world. Casting Crowns does a great job of helping its listener connect (or re-connect) with God.\n\nOne more note: This album is GREAT to work out with!!! I do my strength training and cardio workouts with this album. I also like jogging to this album.","classification":5}

His first new song in 4 years, and I was surprised at how good the song actually is. It follows well with his classic delights that he has made distinctively like The Remedy and Lucky with Colbie Calliat. I am very eager to see and hear what he comes up with for his next album. Hopefully, it will be just as good as I Won't Give Up had showed. It is a simple song, but very true to Jason's songwriting. I am very eager to hear what is coming up soon from him.\n\nSong: B","classification":4}

While they just haven't had the definitive sales that have shown with their albums in awhile, they have made a good impact back into the light with Hey, Soul Sister from their new record Save Me, San Francisco. But, their classic songs still remain as distinctive as you could imagine like Drops Of Jupiter, their 2001 smash which is still as strong to listen to today, as it was when they Pat Monahan and company made it nearly a decade ago.

{"text":"In a recording career that has spanned 14 years and includes 9 best selling albums and 2 Italian compilations, Ann Sweeten has managed to achieve a level of success that many musicians only dream of. In addition to her music consistently placing high on the charts, receiving extensive radio airplay, and winning numerous awards, she holds the prestigious title of an official \"Steinway Artist\/ Composer,\" placing her in the company of some of the most distinguished pianists in the world.\n\nHer latest release, \"In The Wake,\" is a showcase for the skills that have elevated her to such lofty musical heights. The album is co-produced by Windham Hill Records founder and Grammy award winning producer Will Ackerman, who also plays guitar on two tracks. Additional instrumentation includes flute, English horn, oboe, violin, violoa, and cello, all of which are used sparingly to lightly season and subtly enhance the flavor of her rich piano compositions. Among her inspirations she lists one of my all-time favorite pianists, Suzanne Ciani, as well as composers Stephen Sondheim, Erik Satie, Tchaikovsky, and Debussy, revealing her classical background and new age influences.\n\nAs I put on the CD to listen, the heartfelt warmth of the opening notes, inspired me to draw in a deep breath and settle back to luxuriate in the elegant music that was unfolding. Delicate acoustic guitar by Will Ackerman shadowed Ann's playing with graceful understatement on the first song, Mid-way through, an airy flute soars above the rising and falling melody like a sea bird gliding just above the waves. On the solo piano composition, \"Metamorphosis,\" I appreciated the contrast between spaciousness and Ann's tinkling harp-like glissandos that adorned the arrangement. On the wistful \"Love Remembered\" violin and viola add a poignant touch to the ambience. The last song on the recording, \"Now, and Again,\" makes a fitting finale as oboe and cello intertwine with Ann's exquisite piano artistry in a piece that would make an enchanting film soundtrack. Her music is both contemplative and emotionally evocative, providing a world-class listening experience.","classification":5}

I had a fianc in college who was totally cold to me, once she had me where she wanted me, and this became my anthem. She would sing it, too, singing \"I'm as cold as ice, oh yes I know.\" We were too young, I suppose, and we ended up ok going different directions. Later, I gained a mother in law who was even colder than ice. All of that emotion is wrapped up in here ... given a voice.","classification":5}

{"text":"You can tell when an artist put strong effort into an album because you'll be able to feel it straight through. Case in point with Foxy's Broken Silence. Her first album, Ill Na Na I enjoyed. Chyna Doll not so much but this album was a huge improvement. For starters we all know that she was going through a lot of stress before she started working on this album. On here she adresses how she tried to commit suicide by trying to overdose on medication and she talks about her relationships as well as her beefs. She does most of her revealing on the track The Letter featuring Ronald Isley. The track is was already great but Ronald Isley on the chorus was the icing on the cake. B.K Anthem should have been the anthem for Brooklyn seeing that it is one of the best anthems to a city ever made. Foxy keeps it true to her reggae roots and Tables Will Turn, Na Na Be Like and Run Them(both Tables Will Turn and Run Dem are featuring Baby Cham). In the most unexpected matchup I've ever heard at the time, Mystikal and Foxy Brown on Bout My Paper was magic plus that laidback beat was crazy. Another song that was crazy is the Capone and Nore assisted Run Yo S***. 730 by itself goes in the classic file as Foxy throws some sharp barbs at Natina of Blaque and Lil Kim. Hood Scriptures is another crazy track with Foxy spitting over an exotic beat. Oh Yeah with Spragga Benz was a pretty good single and the end track Broken Silence is beautiful(do you notice how every song that sampled Broken Wings sound better than Broken Wings?). Bottom Line: Foxy Brown poured her heart and soul into Broken Silence and the end results is a beautiful classic. She was so into it so much that you can tell that she was crying on certain tracks(Broken Silence and The Letter). All in all it was a excellent effort and is her most slept-on album(check the record sales if you think Im kidding). Standout tracks: FALLIN, OH YEAH, B.K ANTHEM, THE LETTER, 730, TABLES WILL TURN, HOOD SCRIPTURES, BOUT MY PAPER, RUN YO S***, SADDEST DAY and BROKEN SILENCE.","classification":5}

{"text":"Backtracks is the long awaited release of the songs AC\/DC had mostly had only released as B-sides to singles, but never found there way onto an actual album.\n\nMostly every AC\/DC collector already has all of these songs. Either from bootlegs, internet downloads, or from the AC\/DC website itself where a lot of these tracks where available to hear when you connected to the site using the Sony digi-packs they released a couple of years ago.\n\nStick Around & Love Song where recorded in 1974 for there first album HighVoltage which was released and still available only in Australia. Most of the original Highvoltage album and there next album in Australian, T.N.T where combined to make the world wide release of High Voltage. Only two of the tracks from the original High Voltage where on that album, and all but two of the rest where released later on 74' Jailbreak. These two tracks here should have been added to 74' Jailbreak, but what can you do about it now?\n\nFling Thing, Carry Me Home & Cold Hearted Man where recorded at the same time in 1976 or so, (along with Love At First Feel) and only got released as B-sides to a few singles. Though \"Cold Hearted Man\" was issued on some pressing of Powerage in Australia and Europe, however, those LP's are considered rare collectors items now.\n\nR.I.P. (Rock In Peace) was released on the 1976 Australian Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap album. The album was not released to the rest of the world due to complications with Atlantic (I think it was) not allowing them to release it as they thought it was sending out the wrong message. After Bon Scott died in 1980, DDDDC was released in 1983 to the rest of the world and instead R.I.P, Love At First Feel took it's place.\n\nCrabsody In Blue is from the Australian Let There Be Rock album released in 1977. It is considered to be the sequel to The Jack and is about as close as you can ever get to AC\/DC almost doing a country number, but don't mistake it for one, it's pure blues driven rock.\n\nSnake Eye, Borrowed Time, Down On The Borderline are 3 songs recorded during the 1988 Blow Up My Video sessions. they each surfaced on B-sides to that albums singles and The Money Talks single from the next album. Each one of these songs could have easily been put onto that album with enough room for more, but like I said, what can you do?\n\nBig Gun was recorded in 1993 for the movie Last Action Hero. It was also to see how producer Rick Ruban was at recording AC\/DC, and he did a well enough job he got the gig for the next album Ballbreaker.\n\nCyberspace was recorded in 2000 for the Stiff Upper Lip album, but was only released on certain special 2 disc tour editions in various parts of the world.\n\nCD 2\n\nCD 2 features tracks that mostly all where also released as B-sides to various singles over the years. However they have been cleaned up and sound even better then before.\n\nDVD\nSpeaks for itself doesn't it?\n\nIt's a good little package, and it's about time AC\/DC released these tracks. However, where there is good, comes the disappointment. It's good to have all these songs remastered and sounding better then ever, but I can still not give it 5 stars. Because as a collector, I already have all this material. What we really wanted, was not just the stuff thats on here that we already had, but the songs we know exist, but are locked away in a vault somewhere. Plus the other songs that we do have that aren't included here.\n\"Shes My Babe\" has surfaced in recent years as the warm up recording to Ballbreaker, but that isn't on here. Then there is the ones no one has heard, but know of, such as \"Tight Rope\", \"Out Of Bounds\", \"The Cck Crows\", \"Rave On\" and a few more.\n\nThen there is the live material, such as Johnny B.Goode, Lucille with Phil Carson, Brians Shake, Messin With The Kid.\n\nBrian has quoted before they can never satisfy what the fans want, well, haha, yas did it again ;) Lets hope for Backtracks 2!","classification":4}

{"text":"Sadly I never realized how great a Guitarist Prince was until after he passed away - I saw the movie years ago and I thought someone else was playing guitar, i.e. Lip Sync, Guitar Sync, Blah, Blah, Blah. A few months after he was gone, I ran across a tribute to The Beatles and the song While My Guitar Gently Weeps where Prince, with Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, and others was playing this live - I was a little taken aback when Prince stepped up and played the main guitar solo and holy crap, it was amazing to say the least - The Guy Shredded it and did so with such raw and pure emotion that it literally brought tears to my eyes - Needless to say after that I started doing searches for Prince doing other amzing guitar works and, I mean I am really ashamed to some extent that I never gave this guy a listen too many years ago - I mean here's Jimi Hendrix's passion, Michael Jackson's musical craetivity, Jimmy Page's Studio Prowess all tied into one - I respect this man, I adore this man, and I am deeply regretful I never saw him Live. Prince IMO rightfully deserves to be considered one of The Greatest Guitarists of our time and in all the History of Rock.","classification":5}

{"text":"This CD contains the song, \"Cherish\".\n\nOver two years after Robin Gibb passed away, his last solo album is released with some songs nearly ten years old. These were written between the years of 2004-2008 with the hope of using some as part of a Bee Gees reunion with Barry. That was not to be.\n\nThe listener does get treated to an array of some of Robin Gibb's best music to date. It's much more upbeat in style and verse than previous Gibb compositions and the result is wonderful. Relying mostly on electronic equipment, it's tough to tell that most of the instruments are electronic. Robin's voice is more reedy than usual with a higher pitch, but that only tends to pulls the listener in closer. This is Robin Gibb at his most vulnerable and intimate self.\n\nWith a hefty dose of seventeen songs, Robin Gibb concentrates on layered songs backed with a strong beats. In fact, only two songs, 'Solid' and 'All We Have Is Now' are the only slower ballads and they stand up to any previous Gibb tearjerker. One of the standout cuts that are worthy of single treatment are 'Alan Freeman Days' with its excitable exclamatory proclamations. 'I Am The World' is a remix of the 1966 B-Side vocal and it's a layered composition that stands up to modern tastes and styles. 'Broken Wings' contains a danceable beat that begs for an extended version, if not a single release. The instrumental sections and backing vocals are synthesized genius. 'Avalanche', a title taken from a 1970 song is an anthemic upbeat journey of a song with powerful backing vocals.\n\n'Mother Of Love' is presented in its original form and is a nice respite from the bevy of strong songs, but what it lacks in structure, it makes up in pure emotion. 'Don't Cry Alone' is a wonderful reminder of Robin and RJ Gibb's classical hybrid, Titanic Requiem'. The closing cut, 'Sydney' is one of the saddest songs I think I've heard any Gibb brother sing. Reportedly recorded on an iPad with sparse working, the lyrics and the yearning vocal tug at your heart when you realize what Robin is singing about - a loss of innocence and younger times. It's the perfect finish for this album.\n\nWith a nice cardboard sleeve and notes from his wife Dwina, this makes for a fan special. Note that the Isle Of Man Post Office is releasing a limited edition of this album (1,000 copies) with an accompanying DVD. Robin Gibb deserves this and more. Thank you Robin.","classification":5}

{"text":"I just got into Sturgill Simpson today after reading his rant against the Academy of Country Music over them stamping Merle Haggard's name over some award that has nothing to do with his legacy. First off, total agreement. Well said, Sturgill. The Hag would hat roughly 99% of all new country music because it's generic teeny bopper garbage.\n\nSturgill Simpson doesn't have that problem. This guy can flat out sing like a real county musician. His band has it's own sound and doesn't conform to any preset molds. It's not all steel guitars and such. He uses the sound of a small orchestration behind him to give his music a very unique property. His voice though is all country. I mean real country. Like George Straight \/ Waylon Jennings country. He's got twang in his tone without overdoing it to play into a role.\n\nThe first song on this album, Welcome To Earth, made me cry. I'm not a crier. I don't drop tears at every semi emotional moment in life. But I am a parent. And this song is all about welcoming your first child into the world and being overwhelmed with love so pure and so strong its like having your soul taken over. (If you're a parent, you understand) Simpson captures those emotions perfectly.\n\nWhen you get to Keep It Between The Lines you hear VERY traditional country rock vocals set to a sort of 1970's soul band sound. It's a really cool mix that's working on every level!\n\nIf you want a true old school very traditional country sounding song both vocally and instrumentally, check out In Bloom. It's got what you need. Later in the album All Around You will take you where you need to go as well.\n\nI had honestly never heard of Sturgill Simpson before today because I largely abandoned new country music over a decade ago due to it mostly...you know...sucking. As such I have just been out of sync with most new country acts. I can see why Nashville doesn't promote this guy heavily, because he's good. They seem to hate that lately. I'm not saying ALL modern country stinks. But the good artists these days are few and far between. And none of them are as good as the older generation of county singers. Sturgill Simpson belongs with that older crowd.","classification":5}

It has some nice flourishes such as great sax solos, judicial use of cow bell, and one of the nicest drum solos recorded, with ample timbale which lends an exotic flavor. There is great synthesizer throughout with strong performances by all backup musician. The drum solo on this version is a little longer than the radio version (I like this slightly longer version better).\n\nThis is a great classic that deserves to be in both pop and progressive catalogs.","classification":5}

Their harmonies will make you sing along with them and if you love music like I do you'll be singing their tunes in your head too.\n\nMy whole family loves this group and one of its members brothers gave my sister a kiss on the cheek when she got her album autographed.  They were very nice and continue to this day to make fabulous music.  I miss them creating new sounds although some of them still perform like El Debarg one of the brothers.

You buy the cd supposedly with all the hits from your favorite artist but whomever compiled the cd put a different version of one of the jams on the cd. OR, there is an impressive list of hits on the cd but one or a few of the hits are missing?\nMaybe the answer is that all of the GREATEST HITS will not be on\nthe disc unless the cd says ANTHOLOGY or THE COMPLETE... Still,\nwhat indicates that a version of the love song that YOU grew up\nwith ain't on the disc?","classification":5}

I enjoyed every single song on all 3 CD's and truly enjoy the way the mix great rock songs with a few religious lyrics songs mixed into the batch.  To give you a few examples I want to Live, Lions when it says \"We walk by Faith not by sight\", Saviors of the World, and The Resistance.  Then you have songs like Stars and Watching for Comets that make me think of my future wife and the lyrics are so touching and shows great emotions.  Then you have the hard rock songs like Feel Invincible, Back From The Dead, Undefeated, Famous, Out of Hell, and Burn it Down.  So in closing Skillet gives there fans another amazing music CD with a true mixture of songs for every fan of there's between religious songs that make you want to sing along to or even the hard rock songs bang head to, or even the strong relationship lyrics that make you think of your love ones.","classification":5}

The orchestra incorporates the Bond motif beautifully, especially the horns.  Adele's in great voice, still so much like a latter-day Randy Crawford, but hearing her constant intakes of air detracts from the experience.\n\nLyrically... it's not so good.  It starts out in classic Bond fashion- a simple measure having almost nothing to do with the movie for the sole purpose of working 'Skyfall' into the refrain.  Then it switches into sort of an angsty love song or something, again just to work in 'Skyfall'.  Overall- I love the music, like Adele's singing but the lyrics are lacking.  But I guess that's what most Bond themes have been like, haven't they?  lol","classification":4}

{"text":"For the music of 1994, the scene changed immediately, from Grunge to Hip Hop. In the case for Boyz II Men, they became even more popular then the boys from Philadelphia. At that time, they became bigger than most of the manufactured music out there. Although they started big, the ballads they were making were explosive.\nThe 1994 album, II became the most successful R&B album of the decade, selling almost 14 million albums, and launching 4 smash hit songs including Water Runs Dry, I'll Make Love To You, On Bended Knee, and Thank You. At that time, they really proved that the music spoke for itself, not an image among all boundaries. The style blended beautifully with similar artists like The Temptations, The Four Tops, and even The Jackson 5. Nevertheless, they actually were at the very beginning of the Corporate Pop era that lead to Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys. Luckily, the music wasn't locked into Teen Idol stardom, which made Boyz II Men one of the most popular groups of the 90's.\nIt is kind of sad that a lot of teen acts that are out there aren't mature enough like Boyz II Men. It is just incredible to know that some acts constantly can't capture that era. Hopefully, the next true Soul group, can recapture the legacy Boyz II Men set.","classification":3}

I was going to compare Nickelback's songs to \"Bah Bah Black Sheep\" but I think that would be a misrepresentation -- \"Bah Bah Black Sleep\" is far more musically sophisticated. Actually, if you give a caveman an electric guitar, he will probably write better songs than the Nickelback guy because he is not chained to the modern Zeitgeist of three-chord gorilla-rock, three-note vocal melodies, and pathetic drummers that barely navigate an eighth-note rock beat (and even then with zero variation). It's not even a matter of the music being pathetically basic (it's a contingent relationship rather than a necessary one) -- the music is just flat-out crappy. The lyrics approach new standards of verbal diarrhea, and yet with the way certain lines are emphasized you just KNOW they *think* they write really clever lyrics. There is probably a praxeological axiom that states Nickelback is the worst band in the world.","classification":1}

Lorde's cover of the classic Tears For Fears song Everybody Wants To Rule The World is absolutely terrible. I found the song to be a disgrace from the mood of the classic that is more distinctive from the 80's. I do not recommend this, even if you are a fan of The Hunger Games.

{"text":"If you're reading this chances are you already own the original 2 CD set compiled from these 1973 gigs.  So any lengthy review isn't needed for this new additional set of music.  If you like the tunes found on the original set (which are different from the versions on this new set) you'll find even more to like across these three discs and the DVD.\n\nSuffice to say these performances (with a few songs appearing more than once) are superb--Morrison and his hot band are on cracking form.  Morrison knew how to sing a lyric--his tone, his inflection, the small spaces he leaves between words or phrases--all accent his emotional range over these songs.  And listen to the bass\/drums foundation that seamlessly propel this  music.  The strings rounding off some of the sharper edges.  The horns when they get pumping.  And that piano!  Like many of you I also ordered Vol. 1 because the sound (using the original tapes) has been improved for that 'you are there'  feel.  The DVD is an equal visual treasure of Morrison on stage during this period.  And speaking of Vol. 1--the new set is a tri-fold cardboard package with a pocket for each disc.  There's a few color  photos of Morrison (mostly) and the band on stage.  And again there's no booklet.\n\nIn a nutshell--this may be the best (and best recorded) example of live Van Morrison and his Caledonia Soul Orchestra with few (if any) less impressive moments.  When people talk about Morrison as  a performer this set (and Vol. 1) is all the proof needed.  And if for some reason this era of Morrison's music is new to you--buy with complete confidence.  The packaging is a five panel fold-out  cardboard style for the discs, with snap-in trays (with photos underneath)  for each disc, with a  panel with a  pocket for the 10 page booklet that has a two paragraph explanation of the music, track list for each disc, a list of band members, and a few photographs.  Personally I was hoping for a more in-depth look at the music with an essay putting these gigs (and Morrison) into some kind of perspective.  But at least we have this great music which is the most important thing.","classification":5}

If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button (triangle).\n\nOr, if you just want to build up your music collection the starving-college-student way, Amazon offers a ton of FREE music downloads.

CTA is the REAL deal, and the new songs fit well and show this group has fantastic potential. With all the hubbub about the latest release of Chicago's \"lost\" Stone of Sisyphus, I think I'm going to puke.  The reviews for SOS all sound like old fans trying to convince themselves that SOS is the best since the Terry Kath days and that they should be excited and happy.  It might be best, but it is still a gigantic cry from that early magic. Chicago since Terry Kath's passing and even the \"transitional\" Alive Again album is a completely different band and should have changed their name.  All the blues and grit from the early days has continued to be replaced with slick production, synthesizers, and seriously stripped down guitar.  California Transit Authority DOES have that early magic, and I hope and pray they can continue to create and perform.  The WORD must get out. And before you get the idea these guys are just an old Chicago cover band, forget it!  They add their own spice and the new songs show they are every bit as inovative and appealing.  Be prepared to be blown away.\n\nIt is truly tragic that Pankow, Loughnane, Parazaider, and Lamm are not a part of Danny's new adventure. The songs are polished, the sound is GREAT, and, if they are honest with themselves, as musicians (with any personality conflicts set aside), I would imagine they would be crying inside not having been part of this wonderful project.\n\nWhen I first heard that the brass sound on the tracks was done on keyboard, I thought it would sound nothing but cheesy.  NO WAY.  No way at all.  In fact, when I listen to the tracks, I cannot tell the difference except on 25 or 6 to 4 which, I believe, was done live.  I can easily imagine that Pankow, Loughnane, and Parazaider made the studio sessions in secret, but due to contractual obligations, they are not credited. Wouldn't that be a gas?!  Anyway, time will tell if the band can pull off some new tunes that equal or surpass Pankow's inovative big brass sound.\n\nThe new musicans really, really cook!!!  Marc Bonilla is fantastic find.  Though no one can replace Kath, Bonilla has his own magic and the playing is phenomenal. He definitely HAS the down and dirty blues.  Larry Braggs from Tower of Power is a perfect fit for the group. All the other musicans are just great, and they play tight.\n\nOne more comment.  I already knew that Danny was a rock drum genius, but this album makes it painfully clear he was an extremely essential ingredient to the early Chicago sound.\n\nIf you like the Terry Kath Chicago, this is an absolute must buy.  RIGHT NOW!","classification":5}

{"text":"9 years is a lifetime in the pop landscape. In the space between Gwen Stefani's last offering, and this, her 3rd solo album, enormous changes have taken place, the most important of which were her giving birth to 3 children, and of course her tumultuous divorce, that provided inspiration for this new record. Since most musicians are known to thrive off heartbreak, it comes as no surprise that on this new set Gwen sounds creatively reinvigorated. The greatest surprise is how she channeled her heartbreak into the new album, as she recently admitted that her divorce nearly killed her. The 18 tracks\/pieces of her \"Truth\", are evidently more direct than those of her previous records, offering some telling moments (which only make the rumour of another - completed but scrapped eventually - record, even more intruiguing). The thematology is, naturally, heartbreak, and the atmosphere reflective. But this is a Gwen album, the world's most glamorous and cool eternal teenager. What shines the most, is the way she wears her girlishness on these songs, sounding truer and stronger than she has since her No Doubt days, while the songs retain much of the appeal of her earlier work. The extraordinary variety of tempos works great, too. Which altogether make this 46-year-old popstress' \"Truth\" even more impressive. In a youth-dominated field, where there is an unspoken pressure for women to \"act their age\", Gwen single-handedly disregards that false ideal, and makes a fun grown-up pop album, almost just as enjoyable as her first.\n\nNote: Deluxe edition contains 4 extra tracks. On the 20-page (16 on the standard) booklet, where Gwen poses looking uncanningly similar to Marilyn Monroe, there are hand-drawn lyrics and liner notes, a nice creative touch that adds to the album's personal feel. Various editions further include 2 brilliant songs: \"Loveable\" (UK\/international), and \"War paint\" (Japanese).","classification":4}

{"text":"Sufjan Stevens is a mastermind when it comes to making music. Every time Sufjan makes a song you can tell it's him. His critically acclaimed album Illinois was known for the orchestral arrangement of melodies and adding layers of strings and trumpets, and all sorts of interments in it, while also having great poetic lyrics about history, culture and aliens.\n It would take Sufjan five years to come out with The Age of Adz album.\n He once said in an interview with pitchfork, \"I'm getting tired of my voice. I'm getting tired of ...the banjo. I'm getting tired of...the trumpet.\" He wanted something new, and he felt like he wasn't going anywhere creatively.\n\n He got inspired to make a new album when he helped his friend film a documentary on a Louisiana artist names Royal Robertson. Sufjan became inspired and found that he began writing lyrics based on the artist's visions and paintings, and Royal Robertson's personal life, and thoughts and views of the world.\n Around this time Sufjan became very ill. After helping his friend, Sufjan found himself being almost bed ridden and unable to make music. During this time, Sufjan really focused on life and death and living, and also remembered Royal Robertson's views on the world; consequently, you can hear on this album in his voice has some urgency he uses his voice in layers and gives himself a ghost-like feel, and you here in his lyrics the views of death ; for example, he writes a song about himself and uses his own name in the song called \"Vesuvius.\"\n\nSufjan would later end up using Royal Robertson's artwork in the Age of Adz cover and inner sleeves. At first listen, you will find the opening track \"Futile Devices\" will have Sufjan with beautiful arrangements of acoustic guitar and piano playing that is soothing and a typical Sufjan Stevens sound while still having trumpets, horns, harps and a choir in the background, giving an opera feel to it which the rest of the album will consist of.\n Sufjan manages to give you layers and layers of sound and many tones in a track; as a result, you find yourself replaying the album, and trying to name what instruments and what sound you just heard.\nOn the album title track `'The Age of Adz,\" you will hear instruments, but also you will hear what sounds like a car alarms and chants and find yourself in a circus type feel and have mixed melodies. Listen and you will find that he gives you imagery in his sound and organization of song form and lyrics. I found myself wondering what he is meaning, and the more I listened I started piecing it all together.\nThen I found out that Royal Robertson suffered from depression and went crazy after his wife left him and all he did after was make signs and write his thoughts of the future. It all starts to make sense that Sufjan used his life and mixes Royal Robertson's life and combines them and writes lyrics that will fit him and Royal Robertson, and bring the listener into this world which makes you as a listener feel like you are let into ones person's life, and you go through this roller coaster of a story with him.\n\nI will admit at first listen I wasn't sure what to think of this album. I found myself at a record store, and I Loved the album art of the Vinyl LP and bought it because I knew of Sufjan's previous work, and I liked a couple of tracks from his last album Illinois.\nIt came with an mp3 download card which allowed me to download the entire album. I put it on my mp3 player, and I began to listen to to. At first listen, I wasn't too impressed. It wasn't until I put the vinyl LP on my turntable that I realized how amazing this album is. The instruments' sounds have room to breathe on vinyl, letting you hear how detailed and beautiful this album is.\nSufjan Stevens goes for a big dynamic sound which you will hear in The Age of Adz. You will find his writing style is more of love and loss and more about Sufjan himself, which is a first for him, but also he has this end of the world theme coming from Royal Robertson's thoughts about the future and of dooms day artwork he always painted. The last and final track of Sufjan Stevens' Age of Adz is a twenty five minute track called \"Impossible Soul.\"\nThis is my favorite on this record. It tells a whole story in itself and keeps you engaged until the end. It leads you into a story about a man and his mind set after a girl leaves him, then switched to a different point of view, then goes back to the man's mind, then goes to the woman's' mind, then you are left with something beautiful.\nIf you are a fan of music and like to listen to albums as a whole, I think that you will find much depth in this album that you might not get it on the first listen. But when you give it a little more listening to, you will find something that is truly a masterpiece.","classification":5}

{"text":"Lucy is a high-concept sci-fi action movie directed by Luc Besson and starring Scarlet Johansson in the eponymous role as a young woman who is tricked into being a mule for a Korean crime syndicate, carrying a highly valuable synthetic super-drug called CPH4 that can increase the users brain function capacity, and which has been sewn into a pouch in her abdomen. When the pouch begins to leak and the drug begins to enter Lucys bloodstream, she begins to manifest increasingly developed levels of consciousness and physical prowess: absorbing information instantaneously, telekinesis, mental time travel, and imperviousness to pain. So begins a race against time as Lucy tries to understand and control her new abilities, while simultaneously avoiding the drug lords private army, who have been charged with capturing Lucy and returning the drug to its intended recipient. The film also stars Morgan Freeman, Amr Waked and Choi-Min Sik, and has an original score by French composer ric Serra.\n\nric Serra and Luc Besson have been working together for over 30 years, having collaborated on such memorable projects as Subway (1985), The Big Blue (1988), La Femme Nikita (1990), Lon (1994), The Fifth Element (1997) and The Messenger (1999). Originally a guitarist and songwriter, Serra has always been something of a progressive composer, making use of synthesizers and electronic sound effects well before it was cool to do so, and taking the road less traveled when he could: he was the man who brought a decidedly avant-garde sound to the James Bond series in GoldenEye, after all.\n\nTo illustrate the high-technology, futuristic world the film inhabits, Serras score for Lucy is similarly futuristic, a synthetic-orchestral hybrid that occasionally veers off into some of the harshest, most aggressive pure electronica that I have heard in a mainstream movie for quite some time. This isn't the type of acoustic-electronic combo score that the Remote Control boys have been writing of late, though, and its not even in the sonic world of the John Powell Bourne scores either; Lucy seems much edgier, much more authentic, much more uncompromising than those scores, and as such it is likely to be significantly more difficult for some listeners to connect with it on an emotional level.\n\nWhen the orchestra is present, the score comes up with some decent sounds and textures, especially during the engaging, more traditionally symphonic finale. After a few early snippets  the second half of Inner Fireworks, the introspective I Feel Everything, the violin solo in Disintegration  cues like the soaring Flicking Through Time, the powerful brass-heavy pair Moonbirth and Origin of the World have a real epic quality to them, while the solo female vocalist which is introduced into the score in Melt into Matter marks it as the emotional high point of the score.\n\nIn addition, some of the orchestrations and instrumental touches Serra employs are unusual and creative  the didgeridoo in Mr. Wangs Bloody Suite and Inner Fireworks, the out-of-left-field saxophone Euro-jazz of All We Have Done With It, and the acoustic guitars of Choose to Reproduce among them.\n\nHowever, these cues are the exception rather than the rule, and much of the rest of the score combines rhythmic electronic patterns with some gritty industrial sound design, as well as some elements of the in-vogue EDM. The first and last cues, First Cells and I Am Everywhere, both feature the same steady metronomic core, the same heartbeat pulse, and the same sparse orchestration, while later cues such as Pleasant Drive in Paris and Sixty Percent Mess, despite being short in length, are brutal and bold, and pull no punches in presenting the harshest electronic rhythms and textures they can. Some of the cues also feature unusual electronic looping effects, sort of similar to the work Olivier Derivire did on the video game score Remember Me last year, albeit without the same level of ingenuity and panache: its especially noticeable in pieces like Crossing the Goon Sea .\n\nUnfortunately, the one thing Lucy is not is especially memorable. The orchestral parts are appropriate, but never really stand out from the myriad of other appropriate orchestral parts in other, similar scores. The electronic elements, despite being abrasively authentic, have been done better elsewhere, and don't break any new ground. Theres no real recurring thematic content beyond the ticking of the first and last cues, and theres no identity for Lucy herself, which is the most curious thing of all: Luc Besson is so enamored with strong female characters, from Anne Parillauds La Femme Nikita to Natalie Portmans Mathilda in Lon and Milla Jovovichs Leeloo in The Fifth Element, that one would expect the conceptual centerpiece of his story to be accompanied by the musical centerpiece of the films score, but this is not the case. Instead, Lucy is a score which skirts around the edges, presenting some clever textures and orchestral flourishes, but little else. Im not saying that ric Serra only used 10% of his musical talent on this score, in the way that this film clams most of the worlds population only uses 10% of their brains, but you can perhaps see a parallel.","classification":3}

Listening to his CD is like an extended set of the \"Oasis After Dark\". He released this CD on his own a year ago and after sellin 10,000 copies he managed to get the attention of Motown. Listening to this CD is difficult because while the tone is great and his vocals are good there seems to be something missing. I often found myself asleep before the CD was finished. Kinda like listening to one of those \"Sounds of The Earth\" CD's ... or something to help you go to sleep. 10 distinct songs about love and life. He goes from an Al Jarreau sound on Track 7 \"Brotha Man\" till a Simply Redd feel on Track 3 \"Say\", my favorite track on the CD by the way. Soothing is the best thing I guess you can say about this CD. A nice CD to go to sleep to. Now whether that's a compliment or not I'm not sure. This is definitely not for everyone, but the Jazz Enthusiast will probably be more likely to find use for this CD. \"Is it like Floetry\"? No. They are more hip than this CD. \"Is It like SADE\"? No. She invokes more soul in her music. \"Al Jarreau?\" No. Jarreau is more livelier than this cat. This one still kind puzzles me. My favorite cuts are 3,4,5,and 6.

Led by singer-songwriter David Gates, Bread would amass an impressive total of nine Top 20 records during the years 1970 thru 1973.  Formed in Los Angeles in 1968, David Gates and Bread would quickly establish themselves as a force to be reckoned with on the Billboard Hot 100.  Their debut single \"Dismal Day\" failed to make the charts in 1969.  However, the group's second record \"Make It With You\" went all the way to the top of the charts in the summer of 1970. And the hits just kept on comin'.  In late March of 1971 Elektra records released the beautiful love song \"If\".  The song was an immediate hit peaking at #4 in May of that year.  As far as I'm concerned this is the best song they ever recorded.","classification":5}

{"text":"I was recently in search of the best L'Elisir d'amore that I could find.  Because Pavarotti was admired as the Donizetti tenor par excellence, his two recordings, early and late, were obvious contenders. The Decca version has always been preferred, thanks to the freshness and charisma of Pavarotti's singing - he owned Una furtiva lagrima for decades - but as much as Sutherland is beloved, her Adina is girlish or light; she tries hard to bring the right comic tone, and even her notorious pronunciation is improved - but a second drawback for me is Bonynge's conducting, although he too tries hard to bring rhythmic life to his ordinarily slack style. Of course, the testimony of countless fans sees beyond these limitations - so be it.\n\nThe later DG L'elisir corrects the weak points in the earlier with alert, expert conducting by Levine and Battle's utterly charming Adina, her voice and characterization a delight. But Pavarotti! This recording dates from a series of live Met performances that began in 1989 (there's a met release in MP3 at various download sites), and the great tenor's voice had grown creaky  and threadbare - to me, it's painful to hear.  When the lead singer is unacceptable, so is the entire performance. Apparently this isn't the case for the enthusiastic reviewers here, but newcomers should be warned. I bought the set sight unseen and threw it away.","classification":2}

{"text":"David Bowie, is the only artist (while he was alive) that I did not hesitate to buy one of his compilations. It has always has seemed to me, that each compilation released, has been thoughtful in its sequencing,to eventually create a unique listening experience. And more importantly , that the artist was present.  The same could be said for Nothing Has Changed. The reversed chronology of the album, and the different versions , plus the bonus or unreleased material , makes this required  Bowie listening for the die hard and the novice. This is not a schlock-y, hastily put together, jukebox-y collection of single edits for mass appeal. It's a thoughtful walk with Bowie through his entire career, and the many moods, and aural experiments we we were privileged to hear.","classification":5}

{"text":"Few would have guessed that Type O Negative would still be developing and improving after all these years. Sure, this album may not contain any obvious classics, and some longtime fans may complain that distinctness and variety are missing from the band's most recent work. But at the level of an entire album, Dead Again is the most consistent and accomplished release of Type O Negative's career. The band's wild-and-wooly past achievements, not to mention Peter Steele's darkly odd sense of humor, are still represented here in \"Dead Again,\" \"Halloween in Heaven,\" and \"Some Stupid Tomorrow.\" But otherwise, many of the songs on this album show great strides in the Type O game plan, and as an overall statement this album is a punishing display of sonic architecture and mood manipulation. The playing is better than ever before, with guitarist Kenny Hickey and drummer Johnny Kelly toughening up their attacks considerably. Kenny's throat-shredder vocals are also utilized with great success, offering effective counterpoints to Peter's always grave-rattling lower baritone. There is some intrigue in the songwriting department as well, including the dramatic quasi-ballad \"September Sun,\" which includes a surprisingly romantic piano intro from Josh Silver.\n\nMeanwhile, Type O's songs are getting longer and longer overall, and here the lengthy compositions offer the band room for true musical exploration, rather than just repetition. This album's pinnacle is surely the sinister epic \"The Profit of Doom,\" while the 14-minute apocalypse \"These Three Things\" actually manages to stay musically fascinating throughout its entire length (though it tends toward Tool-ness in places). One source of static here may be the lyrics, as Peter's eccentric manic-depressive humor has been largely replaced by esoteric neo-Catholic theology, particularly in \"An Ode to Locksmiths\" and the aforementioned \"These Three Things.\" Also, many reviewers seem to be picking out one song that doesn't quite work, and I would nominate the sluggish \"She Burned Me Down,\" which isn't quite the epic slow-burner that it thinks it is. But overall, Type O Negative have nearly two decades of crushing and subversive goth-metal under their belts, and this album shows that they're not even close to slowing down yet.

{"text":"It looks like I'm in the minority, judging from so many glowing reviews on here, but for me this new album by the Wallflowers was a disappointment. A frustrating mix of great songs and mediocre ones. My least favorite song on here is the opening track, \"Hospital for Sinners.\" Interesting lyrics, but the musical composition is just boring and repetitive. The two cuts with Mick Jones (from the Clash and Big Audio Dynamite) are better, but they sound out of place within the context of the other songs on this album. But then on track 6 --- finally --- the Wallflowers deliver a truly great song with \"Love is a Country\" and you wonder why the rest of the songs couldn't be this potent and wonderful. Really, that song towers over everything else on this album. They hit the mark again with \"Constellation Blues,\" another track that ranks with one of their best, but for me those two outstanding songs don't redeem the dullness of many of the other tracks on here. Okay, maybe that's too harsh; the rest of the tracks aren't all dull, but compared to some of the truly impressive songs that the Wallflowers have recorded over the years, many of these new songs just don't reach the same lofty heights. And I was hoping for more of that old magic on this new album.","classification":3}

Neyo lends brilliant vocals to the song and conveys a message of following personal dreams.  \"Champagne Life\" by Neyo is great for those who enjoy cheerful songs to add to a happy playlist and\/or musical tracks that imbue a celebration vibe (to play at a party and\/or another event to mark a positive occasion).","classification":5}

{"text":"So I got this on vinyl instead of cd, based on all of the bad things I was hearing about the sound quality. I am so glad I did, because the white vinyl sounds amazing, blows the cd away and by far! It also breaks in and sounds even better after a few plays, and remember transparent color and clear vinyl will normally always sound better than black (unless virgin or high end pressed), more virgin in nature. Now on to the music, holy crap, this is hands down my favorite release by this wonderful band! To make sure after my first two listens, I went back and listened to Gimme Fiction and GA GA GA GA GA, and where those are both great albums, they do not even come close to having the production quality of They Want My Soul! Bringing Alex Fischel in to the mix and using David Fridmann to do the mix (and having Britt Daniel at the top of his game), well that delivered some of the most wonderful layered\/textured rock music I have heard in a long time. Can't name a favorite right now as they all sound amazing to me! This is one amazing album and for Rolling Stone to only give this four stars, well maybe they should let Bob Dylan to do a harp solo on the next one...ha!","classification":5}

{"text":"I am not certain what this is but it isn't a band.... I liked the songs I heard which preceded the album... I still do, but my problem with this is that the \"band\" barely wrote any of the songs. It's actually ridiculous. I am just struggling with what this is being sold as... it isn't a \"supergroup\" it's a project - which btw feels calculated to emulate the Whitesnake 87 sound and\/or Blue Murder which came after it. I knew this was off when I heard that horribly clich balad \"Never Say Goodbye\" ...a song that no grown man could sit thru. There are some good songs, some decent ones and some which are not that good but this is producer Alessandro Del Vechio's project. As he wrote the majority of the songs, plays keyboards and songs background I really don't understand why he isn't a member of the band...at least that would have lent some credibility to this thing but as it stands - at least to me - is that you have Whitesnake wannabe and not even close to being on par with that. I wanted to like this but it just isn't sitting right with me. It's hard to explain. All of that being said I like Goldy's playing (probably because I like John Sykes and I can hear that influence here). Chas West, I actually wanted him to get the Red Dragon Cartel gig as I think out of all the replacement guys they had in there he did the best job.... his voice is a little warbly in places but overall I think he did a nice job. Rhythm section is solid (especially considering that none of these guys recorded in the same studio)...it's a bit keyboard heavy for 2016 IMO but it's a nice throwback sound - if only this were a band not some sort of manufactured product I could probably get behind this.... Oh, and the cover, what an awesome cover for a metal album... but this isn't a metal album? ...this is AOR hard rock.... the only reason I can think of for this cover would be to dupe Dio fans into thinking this was Goldy playing metal - which it's decidedly not.... I am probably being too conspiratorial but I am a big supporter of the singer\/songwriter model.... I had hoped that the Desmond Child style era of hard rock ghost writing was over. What really gets me is that the song that Goldy and West wrote together is actually one of the better songs on the album... why they didn't write the whole thing this way is beyond me... I think that decision was Frontiers","classification":3}

Sadly, they had stopped delivering in real quality than listen to their own voices. Taylor Swift has been a singer that really has grown with her sound nicely, and had made some very catchy songs. So far to what she has done with her album 1989, is honestly made some really good songs that has shown she has grown with her work with time and age. Shake It Off and Blank Space have actually been really good songs from bottom to top, and Style, the third single from her 1989 record is actually a really good song. She really has definitely grown in her work nicely, and the song does follow with a mammoth set of songs that really have grown with her in time. It is a better song than We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, and truthfully a great download for die hard Taylor Swift fans.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","classification":4}

{"text":"Why do I always hear supposed die hard fans saying over and over how prince isn't releasing albums as good as purple rain anymore? U can not expect an artist to simply dwell in the past. Someone as talented as Prince has tons of stuff in his vaults that we'll probably never hear not to mention the fact, thatt his \"worst\" is far better than anything you hear on radio today. There are so many artists now trying to be the new \"prince\" listen to most r&b artists out there and u will see what i mean. Why do people always go back to the 80's? and why do people always want him to do another \"purple rain\" or \"kiss\". if u ever notice no one but prince could have pulled off the song \"kiss\" No one in today's geration even comes close to meeting him on his level. His guitar playing is off the charts, and his live performances are eviable of even the best people out there today. Did anyone see him on the Rock N' Roll hall of fame? where  he is on stage with great players, great musicians and talented singers? somehow without uttering a word and simply by playing \"while my guitar gently weeps\" he totally blue everyone away, Tom Petty even seemed to be staring in disbelief at his showmanship. My point is the two prince cds that are included here, are not gonna change the world but they are great songs. Something u can listen to. The ballads are beautiful and takes u back to when a man actually loved his woman and didn't consider his girl to be a bitch that he had to smack up. I have not listened to the bria valente cd yet, well not with my full attention. But this is more or less a prince project, so we'll just talk about his part in it. The songs are great. I don't see Prince being too innovative or even provacative anymore, simply because if there was something innovative to be done, he's already done it already. I never understood why everyone hated \"new power soul\" it was a great cd as well, but just because it wasn't groundbreaking everyone gave it bad reviews. He was simply singing songs with his band and having fun. Someone like him does not have to reinvent the wheel everytime he releases a cd. He's basically been there and done everything. That's not to say he's crusing either. There are great songs. Lotusflow3r is filled with great guitar driven songs, while MPLSOUND pretty much has that old school prince flavor while still sounding new. I would definitely reccomend this 3cd set to anyone who is either a prince fan (die hard or moderate) to those who just want to hear great music. to see how it should be done. I think everyone holds prince to an unobtainable standard. he's never gonna sound like 1984 Prince, because it's not 1984. I remember when around the world in a day came out and parade, no one seemed to like them either or \"get it\" but those were the first two albums that totally got me hooked on his music, before then I only listened to the top40 he was one of the first artists to make me see that the best songs never quite make it to radio. The album tracks were the stroger one. and history usually judges prince cds better than say most critics. Entertainment weekly only favors him anyway when it's a Warner Brothers Release as they are owned by Time Warner. So do not listen to critics or supposed die hard prince fans, as any realy prince fan knows anyone who says Purple Rain was his best isn't really a serious fan of his work. I'm glad i can listen to 2cds and not hear what everyone calls \"consistancy\" they want all the songs to have a singular purpose or sound. Prince can't be tied down, the styles\/genres are simply more tools at his disposal everything he does is devoted to great music. so if one song doesn't sound like it really belongs on the same album with the rest, I don't care, as long as they are good songs. Concept albums are great, but 99 percent of all albums are not concept albums. So enjoy the variety, it is so refreshing after hearing today's hits, to hear someone who can take any genre and bend it to their own personal liking. Even without the bargain price of this set, i'd reccomend it to anyone who loves good music. It's all just good ol' fashioned purple rock n' roll. so enjoy.","classification":5}

This album compels you to move!  The strongest songs on the album are: U & Me = Love (strange title, but excellent), America, Becoming, Yes U Can, Sweet Temptation, Haunted and Intuition.  It seems she really wanted to \"cook\" on the last half of the album because those songs have the best musical content, lyrically and musically, in my opinion.\nThis is a definite buy!  Much, much better than her last album, but not quite the caliber of Spirit.","classification":4}

A new sound for a new decade, Nirvana and other grunge groups put an end to the popularity of the 80s pop\/metal movement. While, Nirvana is an alright band, but I don't consider Kurt Cobain the musical genious that many people claim he his. Kurt wrote some really good songs, but Nevermind isn't really a masterpiece by any means. Smells Like Teen Spirit, and Come as You Are are very good songs, and Nevermind is an enjoyable listen every once in awhile, many of the songs don't leave a lasting impression. If you're a teenager you'll probably want Nevermind, but since they have a greatest hits album I'd recommend that as a starting point to new fans.","classification":2}

{"text":"\"Healing Hearts\" is the fourth solo piano release from Louis Landon in less than two years, an indication that his 2013 move to Sedona, AZ sparked an amazing creative streak for him. Since his move, Landon has established Healing Piano of Sedona which offers a unique sound healing experience to create mental, physical and emotional well-being. Landon is a Steinway Artist who has toured internationally and has released seventeen albums, eleven of which are solo piano (one is a best of). He has been using the techniques of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky for spiritual development since 1980. Healing Piano of Sedona was created to help people live life joyously, passionately, stress- and disease-free.\n\nThe thirteen tracks on \"Healing Hearts\" were created spontaneously to assist individuals in their emotional and spiritual well-being. I have to admit that in the past, I have had a strong preference for Landons more composed music, but he is improvising and performing so much now that his spontaneous music is incredibly cohesive and complete and the emotional content is rich and sincere. Landon has performed house concerts in my series every year for the past seven years and while his music has always been exceptionally good, now its often breathtaking in its beauty and honesty. Nothing is held back, coming from the purest source of creativity. Im blown away by the music on \"Healing Hearts\" and am certain that it will be the second of Landons albums on my Favorites list for 2014.\n\nMost of the tracks overflow with peace and serenity. In fact, Louis calls his home studio The Peace Palace and I can see why! A couple of pieces are a bit livelier, but the entire album is perfect for a warm and soothing background. However, be sure to treat your mind and soul to a blissful hour of calming music that can effortlessly heal the spirit and wash away the cares of the moment, the day, or life in general - at least for a while.\n\nAll of the tracks are exceptional, but Ill mention a few favorites. Amys Song is a breath of fresh air - graceful, tender and very warm. Gorgeous! Desert Peace is somewhat more ambient and so peaceful. I love the title track, which is more minor and a bit darker, but so poignant and compelling. Now or Never seems to be offering support and encouragement to move forward - gently but firmly. Sacred is almost hymn-like. The Great Unknown is dedicated to a young family member who passed away recently. Dark and sometimes painfully sad, there is hope as the healing process takes place - an amazing piece of music! The Painter expresses the passionate spirit that can flow from one artist to another. Unstoppable begins quietly and simply, gradually building energy, strength and power. Unstoppable, indeed! A great, upbeat ending to a fantastic album!\n\n\"Healing Hearts\" is a must-hear! Very highly recommended!","classification":5}

{"text":"Jan Hammer muses that the first seven days of creation may have in fact spanned a century of our time. If that's true then\n\nthe music on this album makes perfect sense. Basically this is\n\na record of instrumental keyboard interpretations of the first\n\ncycles of life on Earth,all the way to \"The Seventh Day\",a warm\n\npiano driven tune. One thing that must be considered though is that these songs have no bottom-everything lies on top and each\n\ncomposition takes time to develope,but once numbers like\n\n\"Darkness\/Earth in Search Of A Sun\" and \"Light\/Sun\" really get\n\ngoing Jan's minimoog kicks in and things get REALLY busy as they did on later Jan Hammer Group albums like 'Oh Yeah?'.\n\n  \"The Animals\" actually has a very tropical funk sound and is the closest thing the record ever has to a tempo.\n\nBut from beginning to end 'The First Seven Days' never remotely\n\napproches being a funky record,or poppy at all! Jazz plays a part in it but so do elements of world and modern electronic\n\nmusic. Jan Hammer mentions in the liner notes the expansive\n\nnature of music during the mid 1970's and this does seem to be\n\nmade with the intention to form a whole new type of music,just as bands like Blood,Sweat & Tears tried to do eight years earlier. Even if that seems like padding this has to be one of\n\nthe most challanging and rewarding fusion recordings ever made\n\nand because of it's relentless minimalism it's aged alot better then much of it's genre!","classification":5}

I don't like every song that he has churned out, but this song is one of his best.\n\nI heard \"Positively 4th Street\" during my teen years, meaning that the music and lyrics hit me at a time when I was vulnerable, my mind was often in turmoil, and I was forming crucial adolescent friendships.\n\nThe piping sound of the organ, the supporting guitars, the punctuating percusssion, and Dylan's sarcastic tongue hit me where I lived. The lyrics caused me to examine my own relationships, especially with people who didn't seem to care a lot for me! In other words, I loved this song as a teenager, and still go back to it when someone disappoints me!","classification":5}

{"text":"It may sound odd, but, the main reason I purchased the entire album and not individual songs, as I usually do, is that the production quality on this album is AMAZING.  Every song is a pleasure to listen to through headphones - the instruments are all beautifully arranged in the mix and the sound just fills your ears in the most natural, gorgeous way.  A big reason for this, I believe, is the fact that acoustic instruments are used over synthesized and it makes all the difference.  The lyrics are outstanding & I love the somewhat dark & brooding nature of most of the songs.  The drums are out of this world good and every beat is crystal clear without overwhelming the mix - kudos to the producers & engineers who did such an excellent job.  I wish production value were as good on more artist's albums, but sadly, most of it today just stinks.","classification":5}
{"text":"This is the song that everybody's heard 100 times before however most people seem to think that it's a religious type of song but it's only religious in that they say the word hallelujah.

(I was asked to use this for a funeral but once I explained to them what the lyrics said and what the song is about.

It features Beegie Adair and some friends, and each of these tracks is a pure musical gem. This sampler offers us the following tracks:\n\n1. Joy to the World, featuring New Age musician David Arkenstone\n2. God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen, with the jazz piano of Beegie Adair\n3. Good King Wenceslas, with the mellow trumpet of Leif Shires\n4. I Heard the Bells On Christmas Day \/ Carol of the Bells (Medley), from pianist Stan Whitmire\n5. Jingle Bells \/ Jolly Old St. Nicholas (Medley) [feat. Beegie Adair], with vocals by Jaimee Paul\n6. Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy, from David Arkenstone\n7. O Tannenbaum, from Nashville's Lori Mechem Quartet\n8. O Come, All Ye Faithful, by keyboardist Michael Omartian\n9. Deck the Halls, featuring the piano of Jack Jezzro\n10. Missing You This Christmas, with vocals by Kathy Troccoli\n11. Up On the Housetop (feat. Sam Levine), with Jack Jezzro\n12. Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming \/ What Child Is This? (Medley), featuring Beegie Adair on piano\n\nThe twelve tracks here are truly top notch, with some excellent and well seasoned jazz performers, and it was a stroke of production genius to build this Christmas album around Beegie Adair. For those unfamiliar with her work, this is a good place to start. Beegie Adair is a jazz pianist. She studied piano at Western Kentucky University and moved to Nashville, where she did graduate work at Peabody College. She later went on to form the Beegie Adair Trio, and that's where we find most of her best works.\n\nBut this is also a good introduction to each of the jazz artists on this sampler, and it's a really keeper, that for this listener will be listened to for many hours during this Holiday season. Thank you to both Green Hill and Amazon for an excellent sampler, one of the smoothest and best free jazz\/Christmas compilations that I've found here.\n\n'Tis the season... to enjoy!\n\n11\/21\/2012","classification":5}

Maybe it's a testament merely to my overtly melancholic & hermetic ways, but all I find on this album is memorable synth beats.  Unlike a lot of (some?) people, I don't think the sheer ability of a song to stick around in your brain makes a song good.  Songs are about feelings.  I don't feel anything when listening to this album.  There's a couple songs toward the middle and end that brought up the experience a little.  \"Clearest Blue\" - the 3rd single also - was OK, and \"Empty Threat\" was probably the best song on the album, even though it kinda drags on as it goes...","classification":2}

Whether you believe it or not, the evidence does seem to point in that direction because not only did he form&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Box-Car-Racer\/dp\/B000066F6U\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Box Car Racer<\/a>&nbsp;while blink was still around, he formed his new band, Angels & Airwaves, only months after blink broke up. I didn't hear A&A's first album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/We-Don-t-Need-to-Whisper\/dp\/B000FG5Q0S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">We Don't Need to Whisper<\/a>, but I still decided to listen to I-Empire.\n\nI also wonder if Tom's heart is really in this material considering it was released only a year after their first album. Anyway, maybe a better title would be I am Stuck in My OLD Empire because although I know Tom is too old to still be singing emo, he has the kind of voice that just isn't suitable for anything BUT that. Remember how on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/blink-s-untitled-album\/dp\/B0000DZDTG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">blink's untitled album<\/a>, Mark was singing lower? Well, Tom's register didn't change at all. There's nothing wrong with that per se, but, well, serious songs and that kind of voice just don't gel like they should. This is especially evidenced when the band shoots for romantic tunes like \"Love Like Rockets\" and \"Breathe\" (\"True Love\" works out pretty well, though).\n\nWhile none of the songs are bad, the songs that stand out the most are the final two tracks: \"Rite of Spring\" and \"Heaven\". The opening track \"Call to Arms\" is pretty good too, as are the instrumentals \"Jumping Rooftops\" and \"Star of Bethlehem\". I-Empire is still satisfying enough for rock fans, but there's really nothing extraordinary here either. B.I.F.\n\nAnthony Rupert","classification":3}

{"text":"The first time you heard \"While You See a Chance\" in the early 80's you hear these luscious arranged keyboard sounds, and it welcomes the 80's decade with a up tempo keyboard solo, then you hear the voice and you say to yourself \"Isn't that Steve Winwood? The same guy who played organ in the Spencer Davis Group?\"  You automatically get a road map of Winwood's new 80's direction.  It's a direction of synthesizers dominating his sounds, and soloing with unique keyboard phrases that defines this era of his career.  Arc Of A Diver is the beginning of  Winwood where he redefines himself.  The album's mix is below par.  The instrumentations that are put together also fail to adhered some kinda of unity, but this is excused because Steve Winwood played all the instruments.  Winwood also engineered and mixed the whole album.  In my opinion when it comes to artists that play all their instruments on their albums I put Arc Of A Diver in the top 5.  Their are some good uptempo danceable songs like \"Second Hand Women\", and \"Night Train.\"  \"Slowdown Sundown\" is more classic Winwood ballad.  You can hear the organ, but their is also a beautiful multimoog solo.  Their are only seven tracks on this album, and a important album in Steve Winwoods career.  The album is only 40 minutes long, but enjoyable!","classification":4}

But besides the single, a lot of the songs just came and went.\n\nGood thing I didn't sell this or give it away because deep inside the lyrics, the melodies and the piano arrangements, is a pleasant gift from Gavin to you. He's very, very smart and in tune with how he feels which is great to hear these days.\n\nNot that other men don't do this, because it's rampantly-common these days. But Gavin just has a way of doing it so, so, so well! So give this CD a chance! I know it took me a while to love it!\n\nI already rated the normal album with the second Stripped version and now I'm gonna do this. So you'll obviously notice that I like the songs much more now.\n\nFollow Through - 4.5 stars. I love this song. It's so innocent.\n\nChariot - 4.5 stars. We've all heard this one a million times. Inspirational and features great piano and a nice arrangement.\n\nJust Friends - 5.25 stars. What I thought about this song initially has changed. It's a great, honest tale of a lying cheat. Gavin's still willing to forgive if they just put the thought in the past and they admit that they really do love each other.\nI'm with him, but hopefully will only be stepped on once and then they're off!\n\n(Nice to Meet You) Anyway - 5 stars. xoxoxox\n\nChemical Party - 4.3 stars. This is a good song. It speaks about a girl who has fun at a party and enjoys everyone but Gavin. He's drunk and she is high...too high to realize him. \"I think I like you but you like this whole room. You sexy machine!\"\n\nBelief - 6 stars. This song is kind of weird, lyrically, at first. But give it time.\n\"When you came to my defense with a knife in the shape of your mouth in the form of your body\" didn't make too much sense to me then. But I've always liked the ending, continue to like it, and I totally understand what he means and is talking about now; love, trust, understanding, affection and sex. My favorite by him so far. Can't wait till the next album comes next month.\nMariah Carey is actually my favorite singer ever, and I'm looking forward to this release more so than her next!!\n\nCrush - 5 stars. Thank you, Gavin. You delivered another strong track. I love the composition of this song. Once again, good job!\n\nI Don't Want to Be - 4.75 stars. Gavin's first single. It's a great one at that. Gives off a good message. Tells the world that Gavin isn't afraid to be his own self. In fact when people expect him to be different, he totally blows it off and finds the power inside to stand out as him and no one else.\n\nMeaning - 5.5 stars. This song didn't really do much for me before...but now it's so not skip-able! In fact it's my second favorite song here. I just love the lyrics. And the falsetto notes he hits a few times. You will LOVE this one. It's a favorite.\n\nMore Than Anyone -  4.25 stars. Cute, but even though it's better than what it was the first listen through, it's just not a standout.\n\nOver-rated - 4.3 stars. I really like the lyrics here.\n\n53.35  11 = 4.85 stars.\n\nEnd note: As you saw, none of these songs gets lower than a 4-star rating this time around. I really am in love with this CD. And I must say, although I've said great things about many CDs, this is definitely in my favorite 20 CDs I've ever heard. For real, for real!\n\nBig ups to Gavin Degraw for this MASTERPIECE. It's pop music without being overly poppy. It's catchy without being too catchy and it might not be raw but it's real. Believe that.","classification":5}

{"text":"\"See You in September\" is an excellent song by Sid Wayne and Sherman Edwards. It was first recorded by The Tempos in 1959 but I think this rendition by The Happenings is superior. The Happenings perform this with much more energy than The Tempos ever did and just one listen tells you their hearts were truly in it! Indeed, \"See You in September\" was a major number 1 breakout hit for The Happenings in 1966, so much so that their version even reached R.I.A.A. gold disc status!\n\nThe original members of The Happenings performing here include Bob Miranda, David Libert, Tom Giuliano and Ralph DiVito; and they do a superb job on \"See You in September.\" These guys never miss a note and they make this a most passionate ballad. The music fits in perfectly with the vocals and the band makes this catchy and memorable at once. It brings back good memories, too.\n\nI highly recommend \"See You in September\" by The Happenings. This is The Happenings at their very best!","classification":5}

{"text":"\"American VI: Ain't no grave\" is the final in the Rick Rubin produced \"American\" series of CDs by Johnny Cash. Like its predecessors, it comprises pared-back covers, as well as (in this case), an original (and purpotedly final) composition by Cash.\n\n\"I Corinthians 15:55\" is the lone original with lyrics looking at his mortality and the hope of seeing his Redeemer. Mortality, love, redemption, and spirituality colour the 10 songs on this beautiful CD, and I must say, for what supposedly comprises his last recordings, he sounds a lot stronger than he did on songs like \"If you could read my mind\" (from \"American V\"), or \"Bridge over troubled water\" (\"American IV), where he was slightly reedy.\n\n\"Redemption day\" (a Sheryl Crow composition) is a beautiful acoustic ballad that wouldn't sound out of place in a Western movie, with Cash singing about the \"train that's heading straight to heaven's gate\", while \"For the good times\" (a Kris Kristofferson composition) is a heartbreaking farewell to his lover as they part and he reminisces the good times they shared.\n\n\"Can't help but wonder where I'm bound\" touches on his journey on earth and his curiousity over his final destination. The solemn \"Last night I had the strangest dream\" finds him dreaming of a world with no more war, against a richer musical backdrop than the other songs.\n\nHighlight, in my opinion\" is \"Ain't no grave\", his fearless and defiant proclamation that no grave can hold his body down when he hears the trumpet sound, and his looking forward to meeting Jesus, his mother and father. Chiming bell sounds, Soft guitars and banjo set to shuffling shackled-footstep sounds which provide the gentle beat to this stirring song.\n\nAs with the previous discs in the series, Cash inhabits and makes each song his own. It is obvious he knew his sojourn here was done and the songs reflect his strong belief of a life well lived and being reunited with loved ones on the other side of eternity. A masterpiece!","classification":5}

{"text":"Eight long years after Celtic Frost initially disbanded (in 1992), the band briefly reformed to write new material for a long overdue comeback album. Then, two years after that (in 2002), C.F. began recording this new material. And flash forward another four years to 2006, and voila, we have a new album from the Swiss black metal legends. So, the long and short of it is, fourteen whole years after what was supposed to be their initial swansong came out (\"Parched With Thirst Am I And Dying\" was released in the early Nineties), Celtic Frost finally blasted back onto the scene with \"Monotheist\" in 2006.\n\nThis is primarily a blackened doom metal album, and it is one that is only occasionally peppered with the brutal death and thrash metal elements that highlighted the band's early works. (For all of those who have been living under a rock for the past two decades, C.F. began their enormously influential career in the mid-Eighties under the moniker Hellhammer, as a primitive blackened death\/thrash metal band.) But \"Monotheist\" favors gloom and doom over death and thrash, ambiance and mood over velocity and volume. So even though it might lack the sheer sonic brutality of the \"Morbid Tales\" days, this new stuff is ultimately ten times heavier.\n\nAnd boy, oh boy, is it epic and expansive one, too. Vocalist Tom Warrior (a.k.a. Tom Gabriel Fischer) and bassist Martin Eric Ain (alongside new drummer Franco Sesa) worked long and hard to create the best possible work that they could. And all of their hard work really, really paid off.  This masterpiece manages to be plenty brutal while, at the same time, exploring plenty of new-sounding elements and experimental musical adventures and innovations. (So, in the end, think Celtic Frost meets Venom meets Candlemass meets My Dying Bride by way of Neurosis and Opeth, and you'll get the general idea.) And, perhaps most importantly, it never comes across as sounding forced or overly labored-over (even after fourteen years in the making!).\n\nThese eleven songs are mainly centered around commanding vocals, powerful lyrics, and absolutely awesome choruses that get seared into the listener's memory bank after just one listen. But don't be lead to believe that \"Monotheist\" is all \"Warrior\"'s show; because it ain't. Still armed with huge instrumental chops, the rest of the band employ the perfect amount of propulsive drumming (including just the right number of blasts and thrash beats), and augment it with memorably heavy, darkly sludgy\/doomy riffs, musclebound rhythms, and a handful of emphatic guitar solos, to boot. Plus, there is a superbly menacing bass tone present throughout. And, of course, one must not forget to mention the several guest musicians on tap, here, too. Lisa Middelhauve (of Xandria fame), 1349 throat Ravn, Simone Vollenwelder, Satyr (Satyricon), and Hypocrisy's famed frontman Peter Tagtgren (who also produced the album), all provide guest backing vocals at one point or another.\n\nThe set begins with \"Progeny,\" which blasts out of the starting gate with thundering, churning power chords anchored by double-kick drumming and iced by really memorable vocals any lyrics. \"Ground\" brings back that eminently memorable lyricism (in the form of an anthemic chorus, where Fischer belts out \"Oh God, why have you forsaken me?!\"), and compliments it perfectly with an ominously grumbling bass line. \"A Dying God Coming Into Human Flesh\" begins with a melodic guitar and bass intro before taking a turn for the heavy side by filtering in some huge, booming riffage. \"Drown In Ashes\" offsets good cop and bad cop vocals, alternating the above-mentioned Lisa's soaring, angelic-sounding clean vocals with terrifically creepy and evil spoken word vocals. The end result is a piece of bona-fide, straight-up, trance-inducing doom metal.\n\nThe curiously-named \"Os Abysmi Vei Daath,\" with its crunchy, churning power chords and punching rhythms, and the succeeding \"Temple Of Depression,\" which boasts some ultra-chunky riffage, both work similarly. Then, following a bouncy little introductory drum solo, the seven-minute-long epic, aptly-entitled \"Obscured\" adopts a heavy doom metal vibe, and one with another truly unforgettable performance from \"Warrior.\" (See \"Drown In Ashes\" for this song's vocal patterns.) But then come the record's two biggest curveballs: Tracks eight and nine, \"Domain Of Decay\" and \"Ain Alohim.\" Both of which are surprisingly up-tempo, brutal, and thrashy numbers, and in the case of the latter, is backed by blistering thrash riffs and deft, thudding blast beats.\n\nFollowing that, though, things then take a turn for the moody side of the line with the closing-three part epic, \"Triptych.\" The first part of it, \"Totengott,\" is a positively bone-chilling piece that evokes vintage Sunn O))) (and, subsequently, Black Sabbath); and is sure to get the tiny little hairs on the back of your neck to stand up. Then comes \"Synagoga Satanae,\" a fourteen-and-a-half-minute long whopper of an epic that successfully balances slow, plodding doom metal tempos (complete with meaty, Sabbath-y doom riffs and soaring, choral-sounding backing vocals) and more up-tempo, speed-metal-lite sections. And rounding out this three part epic (and the album), is \"Triptych: Winter (Requiem, Chapter Three: Finale).\" It is another superbly dark, ominous, ambient, and evil-sounding closing soundscape with a strong doomy, gloomy and symphonic-sounding vibe.\n\nIn the end, \"Monotheist\" is a wildly successful magnum opus that ranks right up there with Celtic Frost's best works. It is easily the best comeback of 2006, and also one of the best black metal releases of that year. And while still nobody is capable of topping The Haunted's \"The Dead Eye,\" this is one of the best all-around metal albums of Ought-six, too. Positively breathtaking, indeed!","classification":5}

And this \"insert rapper here\" was also pulled by Maroon 5 in \"Payphone\", but it seems a bit more tolerable there. Not great. Tolerable.\nBut back to \"Dark Horse\".... The rapping just didn't seem to fit. Like you accidentally hit the seeker button and got another radio station in the middle of the song: jarring and, well, just kills the aura.\nI've learned the counts: listen, skip forward to this count, listen...but one day I hope she releases a version with the rapping just cut out, so I could close my eyes while enjoying it from beginning to end without waiting to cut the song off before the mood shifts grindingly to an (IMHO) incompatible musical genre.","classification":4}

{"text":"How is it that, after four brilliant studio albums and one live one recorded in England in late 2008 (BUCKINGHAM SOLO), Tift Merritt is still not a star of the first magnitude?\n\nWhile pop radio is still obsessed with overproduced divas, and country radio is over-infatuated with the bland, inoffensive hits of Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, Tift has quietly made a name for herself during the last eight years as a singer\/songwriter of intelligence and heart that was a mandatory thing back in the 1970s.  That trend continues with SEE YOU ON THE MOON, a gorgeous bit of rootsy, often folk-influenced, country and rock recorded with producer Tucker Martine in Tift's home state of North Carolina with longtime backing musician friends Zeke Hutchins and Jay Brown, along with pedal steel master Greg Leisz (now one of the most wanted session guys of the last twenty years).  Save for \"Live Till You Die\" (written by Emmit Rhodes of the 1960s pop group Merry-Go-Round) and \"Danny's Song\" (an acoustic folk\/country take on the Kenny Loggins composition that was a Top 10 country\/pop hit for Anne Murray in the spring of 1973), the songs on this album are all from Tift's pen, all of them rendered in her own quiet, breezy, but highly incisive fashion.  And as usual, Tift's musical eclecticism covers social commentary (\"After Today\"), R&B (\"Mixtape\"; \"Papercut\"), modern folk (\"The Things That Everybody Does\"; the title cut) and Linda Ronstadt\/Emmylou Harris-influenced country-rock (\"Six More Days Of Rain\"; \"All The Reasons We Don't Have To Fight\").\n\nWith all this, on top of this album's predecessors, Tift should be up there on that exalted plain occupied by her spiritual mentors Linda and Emmylou, or at least alongside Sheryl Crow (to whom she has also been compared in the past).  And in a perfect world, or if this were still the 1970s, that is exactly where Tift would be.  It's a pity that the powers-that-be that determine who gets radio airplay don't see her music as a legitimate asset, or that a lot more people don't know about her; because over these first ten years-plus of the 21st century, Tift has, for me, been the best female singer to come down the road.  SEE YOU ON THE MOON validates this for me for the fifth time in a row--an intelligent combination of modern songwriting and old school, rootsy musical values.  If you are tired of the same overblown divas and bland Music Row assembly line mentality that so dominate corporate radio, please don't hesitate to check out SEE YOU ON THE MOON--or for that matter, everything else that Tift has done.  You definitely will not be sorry.","classification":5}

And you can see all your life in perspective.\n\nThe piano music of Timothy Crane full of dramatic effect as it is a soundtrack to exciting movie. Exquisite orchestrations are beautifully added to the inspiring music of the artist.\n\nAll these features of Timothy Crane's music are important. But maybe the most significant feature of his music is the composer is always in the moment, he creates in the present time and he is completely immersed in his music.\n\nI can compare the music of \"Pianoforte\" with a colorful butterfly which flutters from one beautiful flower to another.\n\nWhen the music ends one wants to exclaim: \"Why this happened so fast!\" because \"Pianoforte\" belongs to that sort of music which you undoubtedly want to listen to time and again.\n\nThe music of the newest album of Timothy Crane dies down but its charm remains with you.","classification":5}

{"text":"Kesha is a pop artist that you either (1) love or (2) love to hate given her shocking crudeness and overt, unapologetic approach. Sure it is for shock value and sales, but it is a divisive as Kesha's huge personality. 2010 debut&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Animal\/dp\/B002XNEII2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Animal<\/a>&nbsp;was lifted by no. 1 hit \"Tik Tok,\" characterized by it's memorable line \"Wake up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy.\" The album itself was average,  drug down by too much of the same vein of techno-infused dance-pop.  Those who partook of her&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Cannibal\/dp\/B0046M14RG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cannibal<\/a>&nbsp;EP saw more 'range' of abilities of Kesha and ultimately better songs the likes of \"We R Who We R,\" \"Blow\" and personal trashy favorite, \"Sleazy.\" 2012's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Warrior\/dp\/B00A9933OW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Warrior<\/a>&nbsp;balances Kesha essentially, allowing her to rein in herself as well as be herself.  Sometimes she chooses to be more traditional while at others she just lets it 'all hang out.'  Warrior ends up being a solid pop album, surprisingly.  There are no outright misses and the bright spots shine, well brightly.  And more impressive, there are times where Kesha shows she can transcend gimmicky vocal processing (\"Wonderland\")... shocker right?\n\n\"Warrior\" opens the album featuring solid production work from Dr. Luke & Cirkut.  As expected, Kesha balances rapping and singing, doing both satisfactorily.  \"Warrior\" isn't too shabby - albeit gimmicky and somewhat clunky, though it does ultimately feels as if it is missing something. The chorus keeps things together: \"We were born to break the doors down, fighting till the end\/it's something that's inside of us, it's how we've always been\/warrior, warrior...\"\n\n\"Die Young\" easily waves off skepticism, giving Kesha a solid pop moment that eschews her profaner nature for the most part. Half-rapped and half-sung verses are intact, crowned by a jubilant chorus: \"I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums, oh what a shame that you came here with someone...\" Analogous to \"Tik Tok\" in breadth, \"Die Young\" is unsurprisingly a smash.  \"C'mon\"  is arguably better, keeping a similar pop-rap format and hitting hard on a gargantuan chorus. Catchy and feisty (\"I don't wanna go to sleep, I wanna stay up all night...\"), Kesha's youthful rebelliousness bodes well on \"C'mon.\"\n\n\"Thinking Of You\" is solid, if archetypical - particularly Dr. Luke\/Benny Blanco\/Cirkut's harmonic scheme.  Regardless, the groove is addictive. On \"Crazy Kids,\" Kesha talks more overt, profane trash.  While this is how the pop star has come to be characterized, it may be her less vulgar moments that bode best on Warrior.  \"Wherever You Are\" atones for any improprieties, sporting an 80s sensibility reminiscent of new wave. The songwriting structure is solid, sporting verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus format.  Pleasant and commercial, Kesha shines sans profanity.\n\nBut Kesha is a balancing act herself, so a little grime with the help of Iggy Pop on \"Dirty Love\" doesn't hurt.  The tempo is quick and Kesha is at her most manic (\"Oh whoa, I just want your dirty love...all I need is to get in between your sheets...\").  Iggy Pop gets in on the action on the second verse, fitting right in \"Cockroaches do it in garbage cans, rug merchants do it in Afghanistan...\" Risqu, \"Dirty Love\" is a fascinating listen.\n\n\"Wonderland\" contrasts \"Dirty Love\" by slowing down the tempo and giving Kesha a mid-tempo cut. Kesha sounds incredibly smooth, an adjective you wouldn't normally associate with the 'rough-and-tumble' pop star.  She deviates from it on another solid cut, the quick-paced \"Only Wanna Dance With You,\" showing some punk-pop sensibility on the whiny chorus.  The trio of \"Dirty Love,\" \"Wonderland,\" and \"Only Wanna Dance WIth You\" contrasts and shows different facets of Kesha.\n\n\"Supernatural\" seems more standard Kesha fare, not unlike 10's Animal.  Dr. Luke\/Cirkut pound the drums and electronic sounds while Kesha is on 'autopilot': \"Baby when we're touching in the dark can you feel it? I can hear the pounding of my heart can you feel it?\" On penultimate cut \"All That Matters (The Beautiful Life),\" Kesha is supported by the dark, driving synths cultivated by Max Martin and Shellback.  Catchy, archetypical, and solid, \"All That Matters\" does find Kesha issuing pointless cussing that seems more 'shock value' than notable. Closing cut \"Love Into The Light\" finds Greg Kurstin producing and Kesha again opting for the more serious.  The results are half-serious ultimately, as it is hard to take the oft nonchalant pop star seriously: \"I know I'm not perfect, I know I got issues\/I know that I've got a sorted past\/and yes some bad tattoos.\"\n\nOverall, as shocking as it is,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Warrior\/dp\/B00A9933OW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Warrior<\/a>&nbsp;gets the job done for Kesha. It's not the year's best pop album necessarily (Pink and Fun. certainly delivered triumphs), but it delivers plenty of solid and catchy pop. \"Die Young\" is one of the brightest moments, but it is not the sole triumph by any means. Kesha will never be for everybody, but she easily appeals to a pop audience who enjoy their 'pop rap,' however much the lyrics are utterly ludicrous. 3  Stars.","classification":4}

However, I was surprised at how good Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings are.  She, being the lead singer, has a pleasant voice, very melodic with an bit of poetic spin in it.  The song to me was sort of something between jazz and R&B, but resulting in the best of both worlds, since R&B originated from jazz in the first place.\n\nAfter this song, I'm going to try out the other songs on the Album (after I take care of my holiday shopping), and if I like them, I'll try out anything else Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings has done since they were formed.","classification":5}

{"text":"I love these songs. I have varying levels of insomnia (depending on the day and my anxiety level) and struggle to get to sleep as well as stay asleep, to make things worse, medication only seems to work for me for about a week before my body grows accustomed to it and the medication stops working. My therapist introduced me to meditation and, after I commented on how well it worked during our sessions, suggested that I try it before bed to help clear my mind. These work great for this. I especially like the ones with the birds and\/or wind sounds, it's so peaceful and not obnoxious like some of the others I've heard with excess sounds. They help me visualize that I'm in a field or something in the middle of nowhere. One thing to keep in mind; this is a compilation and I found that I already have some of the songs on the full album, so I would suggest going through the samples and checking that you don't already have some of the songs.","classification":5}

{"text":"Other reviews have gone into detail on the music, so I won't go there. I will say that, overall, this is a wonderful set of performances, featuring--to me--the well-known (the symphonies and string quartets), the not-as-well-known (the vocal works) and the unknown (the charming divertmenti and guitar quartet, which I had never heard). All are very much worth listening to, though of course some are better than others.\n\nFor me, the big surprise was the sound quality. I was expecting just so-so, so I was very pleasantly surprised when it mostly turned out to be much better than that. In fact, some of the late symphonies sounded so good that I used dBpoweramp to convert them to very high quality AIF files, with spectacular results when played on my OPPO 105.\n\nThis set would be a must-have even if the price were ten times what it currently is. At 99 cents for more than 14 hours of quality music, this might be the biggest no-brainer purchasing decision in the history of consumerism. I strongly suggest you grab it before the price goes up.","classification":5}

{"text":"A member of one of the most famous families from Bohemia, Franz Benda (1709-1789) entered into the service of Frederick the Great in 1732. As a violin master, he played some 50,000 performances over a forty year period. He also wrote a lot of violin music, 110 solo capriccios, at least 150 sonatas, 31 duets and some 28 concertos, including this one in D Major.\n\nWith a crisply articulated intro, the Allegro ma non molto features a harpsichord continuo and string dominated orchestral support. As a transitional work from the Baroque, it contains more interplay between the single violin and the symphonic tutti than was the norm for the prevalent Italian style. Smoothly flowing, Bendas writing for the solo string is virtuosic without being showy, letting the melodic lines develop naturally. In the minor keyed Largo, the sweep of the orchestral accompaniment lends a somber weight to the throbbing vibrato of Gabriela Demeterova. With a dramatic pathos in the uppermost register, she brings a sorrowful sweetness in her tone that must be similar to the reported quality that set apart Bendas adagio playing. Horns appear for the brisk finale, a bright Allegro with bravura fiddling as the single violin drifts high on the E string.\n\nA generation or two later, Bohemian born Vaclav Pichl (1741-1805) studied philosophy and theology in Prague before accepting a musical directorship in Milan. After 21 years, he returned to Vienna and died while playing a violin concerto at the Lobkowitz Palace.\nHis D Major Concerto Op. 3, No. 1 opens with a marching Allegro sostenuto, clipped and precise. While still employing the harpsichord as continuo, the writing finds even greater collaboration between the soloist and orchestra, engaging in extensive rhythmic interactions and trading melodic ideas, including one haunting echo in minor. A higher degree of technical proficiency of the single violin is also required.\n\nA minor keyed charmer, the following Adagio finds striking support in the lower strings with a lovely countermelody while the ethereal vibrato of the solo sounds so much like the beating of angel wings. Ending the 2nd movement on an open cadence sets up a smooth transition as the resolution occurs in the sweetly pure tones from the violin, the very first notes of the concluding Rondo. Interrupting the relentless drive in the lower strings, a brief passage in minor offers a dark interlude in an otherwise cheery finale.\n\nBy another Bohemian, the final concerto represents the culmination of the Viennese High Classical style. Renowned as a teacher and violin virtuoso, Antonin Vranicky (1761-1820) composed some outstanding chamber music and challenging concertos, one of which is the C Major included on this recording.\n\nUsing tympani and winds to create a broader palette of orchestral colors, the work begins with a bold Allegro giusto. Amid a longer, more extensive development section, the soloist shines in the fiendishly difficult passage work while in the reverential Adagio that follows, the writing stretches the upper reaches of the instruments register. After a chorale like start, the weeping violin carries the movement until gentle horns lead to a serene close. Marked Alla Pollacca- Allegretto, the finale is a frisky Polish folk dance. With an appealing stutter step in the rhythm, this 3rd movement features a brief mournful interlude, dazzling flourishes from the violin and a rousing finish.\n\nThe original recording from 1995 from Supraphon is fine, placing the solo violin close enough for the intimate slower sections to be sharp and clear. Under the able artistic direction of Milan Lajcik, the Prague Chamber Orchestra brings an accomplished reading to their fellow countrymens concertos. But the spotlight rightfully belongs to the exquisite work of Gabriela Demeterova. This fine traversal of the development of the Viennese violin concerto is testimony to her artistry.\n\nPlease note that the 2008 edition includes a video bonus track of the bold Allegro giusto from Vranickys concerto in C Major.","classification":5}

{"text":"I am a huge fan of Reach Records, and I loved KB's debut album and previous mixtape. I like this release, the more Reach music out there the better! However, being an EP, its difficult to get a 5 from me because there is less content to \"grade.\" I'm personally not a huge fan of EPs because I tear through them so quickly, and my chances of landing that big hit song that comes with a good album is dramatically decreased.\n\nI consider myself lucky. Generally, these songs top the best from KB's debut album, Weight & Glory, but some CAN for sure compete with them. 100 and Kamikaze are terrific songs, featuring great guest spots from Andy Mineo and Priscilla, respectively. Undefeated with Derek Minor is a good one as well. The remaining 3 tracks are all decent, and better than most of the stuff we still get from the CCR world, unfortunately. They're good songs, but they represent the low end of the release. Thats why its such a good EP.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is a very good release, but its not exactly a full album or mixtape, fully crammed with music and ideas. So hence the 4. Of course, I still strongly encourage anyone to purchase this, because you can never get too much of KB's music, and technically, if you can score 50% of the songs on a purchase as good as this time, its definitely worth it. So maybe this is a 4.5 EP and a 4 overall release.\n\nBreakdown\nGive My All: 3\n100: 4.5\nUndefeated: 4\nKamikaze: 4.5\nDoubts: 3\nCrazy: 3","classification":4}

{"text":"Lupe Fiasco is one of my favourite rappers, juxtaposing deep socially conscious lyrics against interesting music arrangements.\n\nHis new album is no different. \" Around The Way (Freedom Ain't Free)\" features a horn sample reminiscent of Fela Kuti, but is actually a Pete Rick & CL Smooth sample.  \"Audubon Ballroom\" features cutting strings, the minimal \"B**** Bad\" sets booming bass to skittery beats, while the string-swathed, horn-sprinkled \"Form Follows Function\" has a breezy almost Jazzy feel.\n\n\"Called the President a terrorist, corporate sponsors like 'How the f*** you gonna embarrass us?' Ain't my fault, I was just repeating this Professor Emeritus from Anerica, but my tone was like an Afghani kid without a home\" he rhymes on \"ITAL (Roses)\".\n\nThe retro Soul \"Heart Donor\" features Poo Bear who appears again on the martial-sounding \"Brave Heart\". Bilal appears on the horn\/piano-sprinkled groovy \"How Dare You\". \"Battle Scars\" features a killer chorus by Australian Pop\/Soul singer Guy Sebastian with lyrics about scars left from painful relationships.\n\nThe haunting \"Cold War\" features Jane $$$ and some electric guitar, while the lovely \"Unforgivable Youth\" features Jason Evigan and a light Rock\/Pop feel.\n\nMusic for all the senses.","classification":5}

{"text":"I've been a fan of the Bee Gees since the 80's.  At that time, they were a 'singles' band, the 'baby Beatles' because of their influence.  After the success of the album 1st, which was more of a compilation of singles, their albums were hit and miss.  So when this album came out, in all it's velvet splendor-it sported a velvet cover, but no single to back it up.  After 45 years, I finally downloaded and listened to it, and there were some songs that could have been singles, although they departed from the 'formula' because they went in a slightly 'country' direction, an idea from one of the non brother members of the band.  Country and symphony, who knew?  The 5 piece band was disintegrating with Robin leaving the group after this release\/  They would come back stronger in the 70's, but they kept on recording up until the death of the twins.  The only song that may be familiar is First of May, but the music and lyrics are top notch.  The boys were finding their own voices and style.  But when you consider all the good music coming out in '69-Abbey Road, The who, the San Francisco sound was coining to flourish on the charts, this one, probably also because of it's cost' was ignored.  Maybe that's why it's so endearing now, considering that the guys were Justine Beiber and Miley Cyrus's age when they produced this.  It's an inexpensive download for the original album, and money well spent.","classification":4}

{"text":"Leonard Cohen was a modern-day master poet\/singer\/songwriter. A true musical hero now gone. This song was written by Cohen quite a few years ago, but it fits into our political climate like it was written yesterday. He writes songs from the heart and I consider this Canadian-born poet a better songwriter and singer than Bob Dylan, who he is compared with often, but Cohen sounds nothing like Dylan. He sounds like no one else. Perfect song to start out with if you never heard of Cohen. And it is not religious if that is what you were thinking by the title. You have to listen to the lyrics and if you aren't teared-up by the end, you aren't human.","classification":5}

M.C.A. would lose his life at the end of the day to throat cancer. I was absolutely shocked about hearing of his passing. The Beastie Boys made great rock and rap anthems that stood the test of time. No other example could be set as deeper than their first hit song Fight For Your Right (To Party,) from their debut record License To Ill. The song was just as infectious and driven then, as much as it sadly has been 25 years later. It is so hard to think about because The Beastie Boys made great music at the end of the day, and clean rap that was just amazing. It definitely was one their best songs, and so hard to think about knowing one of the best rap acts losing a deep part of their lives at the end of the day.\n\nR.I.P. Adam a.k.a.

{"text":"Bob Dylan lyrics, left in a drawer, create a breeding ground. Every musician involved composes new music in which the destiny of these words is at last fulfilled. The music is enduring and diverse. The biggest name here is Elvis Costello and he shines on the humorous rocker \"Married to My Hack\" and on the gospel-flavored \"Six Months in Kansas City (Liberty Street)\". But the names that are more sub rosa in the music field engage themselves fully in the music. They switch instruments from song to song. Taylor Goldsmith is at home in the folk taletelling of \"Florida Key\". Jim James, from My Morning Jacket, musically connects the dots no better than on \"Quick Like a Flash\", which can only be found on the Deluxe Edition. The same can be said for Marcus Mumford (Mumford & Sons) on the countryish \"The Whistle is Blowing\", also only found the the Deluxe Edition. But the singer who tops them all is Rhiannon Giddens from the Carolina Chocolate Drops and she plays a fine fiddle and banjo too. Imagine that burst of excitement you feel when you first make contact with her singing on the poetic \"Spanish Mary\" and on \"Hidee Hidee Ho #16\" with her voice and Joey Bellorose's shoe-box drum sound. And her haunting delivery on \"Lost on the River #20\", backed by the stone great acoustic guitars of Goldsmith and Mumford, is something of beauty and transcendence. It gets to the root of American folklore.\n\nUnlike Dylan's \"Basement Tapes\", this doesn't have that album's informal surroundings and it even sounds slick in parts. But I like this music for what it achieves and that's reaccessing that old \"Basement Tapes\" spirit. They're having a great time making music together. There's no sense of entitlement, just grateful acknowledgement from musicians and producer.","classification":4}

{"text":"A real delight that this set from the storied Vanguard classical label is being offered for such a rock-bottom price -- according to Amazon, because it's Bach's birthday on March 21.\n\nDo not let the bargain-basement price fool you, however -- these are excellent performances. The set starts out with a full Mass in B Minor featuring New York's lauded Baroque and Classical choral group Amor Artis under its conductor and founder, Johannes Somary, with the English Chamber Orchestra. (The CD of this performance can be found&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/here\/dp\/B003HDIVTO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">here<\/a>.) A really fine performance in period spirit (though I'm not sure if the instruments were period or not). The sound is gorgeous, well worth hearing at any price.\n\nThen we have Partita No. 2 from Hungarian violinist&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Joseph-Szigeti-s-complete-set-of-Sonatas-Partitas-for-solo-violin\/dp\/B0000CABBG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Joseph Szigeti's complete set of Sonatas & Partitas for solo violin<\/a>. Szigeti was one of the greats in the early\/mid-20th century, and my only regret is that we have just one of his six Bach solo violin performances here. The sound is not perfect by today's standards, but it will be just fine for all but the persnickety. Szigeti's brilliant musicianship shines through just fine.\n\nThe set then heads into harpsichord territory, which I must admit is not my own preferred terrain.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/This-full-album-of-harpsichord-concertos\/dp\/B001VJVSKU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">This full album of harpsichord concertos<\/a>&nbsp;is featured -- including fugue-drenched concertos for two, three and even four harpsichords. This is followed by two sonatas for flute and harpsichord taken from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/this-album\/dp\/B0001CCX84\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">this album<\/a>.\n\nAnother outstanding performer makes an appearance then -- Hungarian piano virtuoso Andras Schiff, one of the finest pianists to come out of central Europe in the latter half of the 20th century. The Italian Concerto and French Suite (both from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/this-Vanguard-CD\/dp\/B000EQ46JG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">this Vanguard CD<\/a>) are both pretty wonderful.\n\nWe then move to a complete set of all four Orchestral Suites played by the Vienna State Opera Orchestra under its erstwhile postwar leader, Felix Prohaska. A big, sweet sound, I believe from the 1950s.\n\nFinally we end close to where we started -- with the English Chamber Orchestra under Johannes Somary for a complete set of the Brandenburg Concertos, taken from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/this-2-CD-set\/dp\/B000FAAK2S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">this 2-CD set<\/a>, which is now selling for 90 dollars (!?). Fine, intimate-sounding chamber recordings, well worth hearing.\n\nFull download size for almost exactly nine hours of fine Bach is 891 MB. Bitrates are variable, and range from an average of 141 kbps (on the Szigeti) to 267 kbps.\n\nWarmly recommended! Snap it up at the bargain price if you can, but worth considering any time.","classification":5}

Musically the 80's have been very strong to them with Kick, and their opus, Never Tear Us Apart is still remained as a classic. While the song is short and simple, the grip from Michael's voice into the song still ignites. I honestly found this song to be one of their best, and it still is just as haunting today, as it was when it came out in the late 80's. While INXS has tried to come back with another singer, J.D. Fortune and with Switch, that didn't work very well. If you really are nee to INXS, and have never heard one single song from the rock group from \"Down Under\", than this song would be a fantastic song to to get.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4}

The song tries to being in a vibe similar to what Prince may have with his music, taking a step away from his influence, Michael Jackson. Sadly, the song for Usher is definitely not one of his high points in music, instead falls a bit from his grace. Hopefully, there will be better music from Usher down the road, because he needs better in his hearts right now. He has a lot going as a judge on The Voice, and for his tribute to Michael Jackson for his posthumous song Love Never Felt So Good, but either way he needs better for his voice, because this was the pits.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2}

{"text":"Prime Cuts:  The Power of a Prayer, Hello My Name Is, Forgiveness\n\nQuipped with memorable lines, stocked with engaging stories, and imbued with life transforming Biblical truths, these are ingredients that make these 12 new cuts from West's new CD so alluring.  After dabbling his toes last year in the festive waters with the release of his first ever Christmas release last year, \"Into the Light\" is West's newest effort following the hugely successful \"The Story of Your Life.\"  Save for the title cut \"Into the Light\" being co-written by West and his producer Pete Kipley (Shane and Shane, Kutless and Mark Schultz), the entire album was written by West singlehandedly.  This shouldn't come as a surprise as West is one of the most sought after writers in Nashville, having written cuts for Rascal Flatts, Mandisa, Point of Grace, Billy Ray Cyrus, Natalie Grant and 33Miles.  And the sui genesis of this new studio album came out of the overflow of \"The Story of Your Life.\"  Shortly after the release of \"Story,\" West collected over 10,000 personal stories from his fans and their struggles with God and the Christian faith.  Such narratives became the muses for his songs here.  West needs to be applauded for sermonising these testimonies for us in interweaving the penetrating pain, frustrations and disappointments of these protagonists with heart wrenching Scriptural truths and profoundly thought out faith statements.\n\nStylistically, West has not deviated from his serviceable pop grooves that made him (in many ways) Contemporary Christian music's equivalent to Jason Mraz or Gavin DeGraw.  Again this album is choke full songs of songs with soaring hooks including the lilting title cut \"Into the Light.\"  With the repetitive chant \"Come on! Come On!\" inviting us to leave our sinful lives to follow after Christ's light, this is the Gospel call made irresistibly indelible.  Nestled in the soft stirring of strings, \"Forgiveness\" is a Godly response towards a lady by the name of Renee who lost her 20-year-old daughter when she was hit by a drunken driver.  Remember to keep some Kleenex at the side when West warmly nudges, \"So let it (the hurt) go and be amazed\/By what you see through the eyes of grace\/The prisoner that it really frees is you.\"  Ultimately our pains can only be put down via the power of prayer, and this is the thesis for the piano based ballad \"The Power of a Prayer.\"  Somehow one would wish West would somehow include more piano ballads as he truly does them with utmost beauty.\n\nWest is not afraid to be creative in his story telling.  Somehow reminding us of the Biblical story of Job where Job would quiz God about his sufferings, \"Moved by Mercy\" finds West and Caitlin Evanson treading lines in an imagery question and response between God and a fellow sufferer.  While the perennial struggle of listening to voices of regret and defeat over anchoring our identity in Christ is the theme of the invigorating \"Hello My Name Is.\"  The crisp guitars, the assertive piano chops and the gutsy lyrics certainly make this one of West's ever cuts.  \"Do Something\" is a Godly kick in the face of any couch potato complainer who is frustrated that God has done enough for humanity when we ourselves would not \"do something\" for His Kingdom.  Despite the rollicking fun in this track, it never should crib us from the theological truth that we are God's change agents.\n\nWith his high energy performance and the propulsive nature of these pop songs, by the middle of the album one would wish for a quieter (or at least a different) change of pace.  Though there's diversity in the stories and lyrics, some of the melodies tend to sound similar and tiresome especially towards the latter half of the disc.  Maybe some variation in production or one or two outside songs might easily simply elevate this problem.  Other than this quibble, \"Into the Light\" is one of West's best records to date.  West never hides away from the brokenness of sin.  But it's in the valley of our hurts, West brings us via these songs to appreciate how beautiful and high the mountains of God's love are.","classification":4}

{"text":"War Report rappers from Queens, NY, Capone-N-Noreaga, or CNN, a period model of East Coast gangsta rap from the 90s and later, have returned to the game this year with Lessons, their fifth studio album and a familiar rollout of their famed street brand. Besides being almost painfully traditional for the duo, Lessons includes all new verse-material and original beats, which are conventional and come from an assortment of credible producers (Ayatollah, Hazardis Soundz, Beatz N Da Hood, etc). Their Queens homie and long time collaborator, Tragedy Khadafi (formerly Intelligent Hoodlum), plays a major and perhaps excessive guest-part and is joined by fellow features Royal Flush, The LOX, Anna Shay and Raekwon. Overall, these are loaded spots but uninteresting in their predictability. Capone and Noreaga do convey some different feelings in addition to hardcore street angst (the madness of ghetto crime in many instances of course, homie-love in \"U.M.A.R\" and lady-love in \"Chinese Girl\" for example) but they're in virtually the same format as all their previous releases. With low relevance, so-so rapping and outdated gangsterism and style, Lessons is a dwindling project from the emcees, whose peak is most likely behind them at this point.","classification":1}

(For the purpose of full disclosure, this was a free mp3 download for me so that only made choosing it sweeter.)","classification":5}
{"text":"Don Henley still sounds great at 68 years of age. The songs on this album all have a personal message for me.  My favorite song is \"That Old Flame\". This is an up tempo duet with Martina McBride. This song reminds me that it can be dangerous to rekindle things with an ex girlfriend.  I never thought I would hear Mick Jagger and Don Henley sing a song together.  They collaborate on a lovely song entitled \"Bramble Rose\", and it sounds beautiful.  The mandolin playing on this song gives this song a romantic sounding quality that I love.  I really like the duet that Don Henley sings with Merle Haggard. This song is entitled \"Cost of Living\". This song reminds me to embrace getting older and to always live in the present.  Merle Haggard and Don Henley possess a wisdom in their vocals on this song. It is definitely a highlight on this album.\"When I Stop Dreaming\" is a beautiful love duet with Dolly Parton. The steel pedal guitar playing makes this sound like a classic country tune. I can relate to the lyrics of a song like \"Waiting Tables\".This song is about a woman waiting tables for a living, and just waiting for something better to come along.  I have worked menial jobs before so these lyrics really resonate with me. \"Brand New Tennessee Waltz\" is a beautiful song.  I can visualize myself learning how to dance the waltz to this song.  This song has lovely violin playing on it. \"Take A Picture Of This\" is a song about how being overly sentimental about the past can be a negative thing. I like the message of this song very much \"Praying For Rain\" is a simple song about the hope for and power of rain.  I never heard of rain being sung in this context before.  I really enjoy Henley's creative lyrics on this tune. \"Where I'm At Now\" is another tempo song that celebrates getting older. This song has a superb rock sound to it.  I really enjoy everything about the album \"Cass County\".","classification":5}

{"text":"The evolution was already in progress and the music of The Grateful Dead had come a long, long way from from 1967 when the band released their very first record: \"Grateful Dead\" to this highwater mark of San Francisco rock exploration entitled: \"From The Mars Hotel\". First released way back in 1974, this little gem was as close as this fantastic band would come to big-time mainstream success until the big bust through of: \"In The Dark\" in 1987.\n\nWith only eight songs on the original release, this re-issue has an additional seven tracks added on to really increase it's value. For the original eight, six of that bunch are considered 'Classic' Dead songs. For most of us the two diamonds from the pen of Phil Lesh are the stars of this show: \"Unbroken Chain\" & \"Pride Of Cucamonga\". But Jerry weighs-in heavy as well on \"Mars Hotel\" with three stunners of his own: \"U.S. Blues\", Ship Of Fools\" & \"Scarlet Begonias\" which would be staples of the live shows...{Well, they STILL are included in the live shows}. And then there is: \"China Doll\", that is about the most beatiful ballad this band ever performed in the 30 Years they existed.\n\nSome of the Grateful Dead's most majestic playing can be found on this record. The arrangements are well thought out, and every note played here is on-the-mark. The piano of Keith Godchaux makes every tune better because of what he plays. Bill Kreutmann, the drummer often sounds like three guys, he really gets to leave his stamp on these great recordings. And Jerry? Some of his finest Solos found on an studio GD record are to be found on this one! He snakes around and dances brightly with this. The melodies are real fine, and with Jerry's help and explorations things head for other star systems often. Jerry reaches and pulls things from spots other players don't know of. But, as space is chanced upon here more than once, he  never loses his path or focus, This is controlled fun. Mister Garcia, is sharp and bright in his tones and with the colors he paints here. Jerry, is just plain awesome throughout.\n\nI thought the Dead would have a hit single or two from this record and plunder some booty on the ol' AM Radio...But, alas that was not to be. Still, this is a winner on all other counts. \"Mars Hotel\" is favorite GD recording from the 1970's. This a grand space exploration not to be missed!\n\nThe bonus material does not detract from the glory of the original record. And I'm pleased to see a version of: \"Wave That Flag\", The early rendition of: \"U.S. Blues\", included here. Also of note is a Dead version of: \"Let It Rock\", normally this Chuck Berry gem is featured in Jerry's band at his live shows, but here is, a stompin' live Dead version. The real treat is saved until the end of this CD, with the inclusion of Phil's, acoustic demos of: \"Unbroken Chain\" & \"Pride Of Cucamonga\" that show the master bassman at the peak of his powers of creative cool.\n\nA Five Star CD!!! It would be equaled over and over again BUT never bested. The goods are right here on this fantastic CD.","classification":5}

{"text":"I'll admit that like most, I discovered this band from their their mega hit single \"Sweater Weather\".  It was such a winter-esque pop delight in the best way.  One of the best songs of 2012.  I also began to wonder whether the band would continue on the upward spiral or become a one hit wonder.  When I listened to their debut album \"I Love You\" I can honestly say I wasn't a fan.  (Don't discount my review just yet).  I agree that their debut album had some good catchy songs, but in all honesty it was just forgettable.  It wasn't a surprise that their next singles didn't have even half of the impact as Sweater Weather.  The album didn't sell well and other than \"Afraid\" no other singles really went anywhere for the band.  So in 2015 when I heard of the band releasing a new album I was on the fence.  The lead single \"R.I.P. 2 My Youth\" didn't impress me on my first few listens.  I'll get back to that song later in the review.  The song didn't hype up the albums release really.  In reality most people had no clue the album was even dropping on its release day.  I actually didn't even plan on listening to the album until a good friend of mine brought it up the night it came out and told me it was good.  I trust his opinion most of the time so I checked it out online and liked it enough on my first listen to buy it the next day.  If the first part of my review seemed negative I want you to know it gets better and better now that I've listened to this album a few more times.  I liked this album, a lot.  Here is my track by track review of what I think is one of the most surprisingly great albums destined to be underrated this year.\n\n1.  A Moment Of Silence: This is my only beef with the album.  I'm sure there is a deep meaning to this, but I lost interest in it quick.  Honestly just a waste of a track of silence.  Call me disrespectful to the bands intentions, I think this track added nothing to the album.  (no rating)\n2.  Prey: This is where the music really begins.  And boy does it kick off perfectly.  I love the aching vibe in the vocals.  There is already obviously a lot more soul in this albums singing compared to their first.  The chorus tops things off to make this hopefully another big single for the band and possibly a career saver(more on that in a bit).  A great beachy beginning to the album.  10\/10\n3.  Cry Baby: This might be their most pop infested song so far.  It grooves by.  The vocals are in the vein of MJ stylistically and I love it.  The instrumentation is spot on.  There is even a hauntingly beautiful guitar solo.  It's almost like the bands take on \"I Can't Go For That\" by Hall and Oates.  The vibes of the two songs come from the same musical universe.  I am rooting for this song to be a single.  In fact I think this would've been the better choice for the lead single.  Maybe my favorite song from the band so far.  11\/10\n4.  Wiped Out!: The epic title track.  Not as catchy as the first two songs but still wonderfully crafted.  There is even a bridge section similar to that of Sweater Weather.  There are some vocal effects that might turn off some listeners but I think they are used masterfully and add a lot to the emotional effect of the song.  Halfway through the song their is a second bridge that picks up the paste of the song into sonic speed almost as it leads to the final act of the track.  The songs ends sounding like a completely different song it began as and its just great.  Some uptight listeners might call the antics of this song 'pretentious', but I call it great musicianship and art pop I can listen to on repeat.  10\/10\n5.  The Beach: Honestly, this should've been the title track.  The album being titled The Beach would work so perfectly with the artwork.  But the vibe of this song is just unheard of.  Another single worthy song to save the band.  The notes the vocals reach during the chorus are achingly beautiful.  This is similar in sound to a recent genre called PBR&B, but I'd personally describe this as Gothic R&B Alternative Rock.  10\/10\n6.  Daddy Issues: The title isn't appealing, but gosh the music is.  This is a perfect low key dance song.  The lyrics are sweet and great to listen to with a lover.  It's ominous in a positive way.  Not as great as the others, but still really really good.  9\/10\n7.  Baby Came Home 2\/ Valentines: Another soothing epic.  The layers upon layers of musical bliss in this song is very cinematic and emotional.  The vocals even contain some nice falsetto.  The different musical cues throughout the song are clever too.  But there is an unneeded section in the middle of silence that really added nothing to the song.  The last 2 minutes were interesting upon my first few listens but I started skipping to the next song before the end soon.  But the rest of the song is still amazing.  9.5\/10\n8.  Greetings From California: There is a somewhat apocalyptic sadness present in this song in my opinion.  I'd compare it's style to the band Glass Animals which is a compliment.  Very tropical jungle-esque.  Nice musicianship as with the rest.  9.5\/10\n9.  Ferrari: The title made me think this was going to be a mindless party song that would kill the vibe of the rest of the album.  I was wrong.  There is a slight industrial vibe throughout the song as if Trent Reznor tried to do some indie alternative music.  Its a groovy industrial dance pop song.  Very somber surprisingly.  9.5\/10\n10.  Single: This song sits next to Cry Baby as one of their most pop infested songs.  The lyrics are sad but the music is mostly positive which makes it even more beautiful.  It starts off soft before blowing up into a feast for the musical heartbeat in the middle before ending the way it began.  I love this song.  It has more of that slight R&B influence too.  Nice.  10\/10\n11.  R.I.P. 2 My Youth: The lead single.  Now I somewhat disapproved of this song when it first came out leading to the albums release.  But dare I say this song has grown onto me so much it's almost scary.  I just can't get it out of my head.  This is the true definition of a song that gets better and better.  I didn't really like it at first but now I can't get enough of it.  But that doesn't change the fact that leading to this albums release this single went nowhere.  Maybe it'll become a huge hit.  Maybe not.  If the other songs released as singles don't do anything for the band then this could be the single that killed their career.  Again, I love it to death now.  I personally hope this turns into a sleeper hit like Sweater Weather or at least enough of a hit that it leaves room for other singles to burst onto the scene bigger.  We'll just have to wait and see.  (Maybe future readers will wonder what I was talking about because it became a huge hit)  Still a great closer to the album.  Some critics have criticized the move of putting this at the end.  I think it ended the album perfectly.  10\/10\n\nSo this album was a vast improvement on their mediocre debut album.  I know many of you really loved that first album, but I can confidently say this one is much better and more respectable.  It's also surprisingly very mature.  The style of the album is very different than what was heard from the band before.  But before anyone starts complaining too soon with remarks like \"They changed their sound too much!  This isn't The Neighbourhood\", how can anyone be so sure of what this bands sound really is so early in their career.  Honestly I'd love for them to abandon most of the style heard on their first album.  They didn't just experiment on this album.  They changed for the better.  This isn't a rock album.  It's not even an alternative rock album fully.  I would compare the style of this album to the R&B influenced 'AM' by Arctic Monkeys.  The American version of that albums vibe if you will.  I'll say its Gothic R&B Alternative Art Pop.  Critics have been kinder to this album than their first, but not kind enough in my opinion.  A lot of the critic reviews for this that I've read seemed lazy and as if they didn't really listen to this masterpiece of modern music.  Yes, this is a masterpiece.  As I've stated before, if the singles don't pick up momentum then this will be labeled as a commercial sophomore slump and it might be impossible for the band to recover, which would be a shame since this album is pure musical art and pleasure.  I want more people to hear this album.  It's the perfect combination of a winter\/summer album.  Of course many people who are going through bad break ups or other losses will find solace in this album but this album is great for music lovers regardless.  It has been on repeat for the past few days and I cant get enough of it.  We could have The Neighbourhoods 'Pinkerton' on our hands.  And no I'm not comparing them because they sound nothing alike.  I'm saying this could be a album that was received poorly upon its initial release before becoming regarded as a classic in the future.  But its already a classic to me.  I don't know what else to say.  This is a step in the right direction for the band and I loved it.  It's in my all time top 10 favorite albums already and I don't say that lightly.  Worth more than a purchase.  I'd love to see this album played live.  Okay I think this is the longest review I've typed on here.  Let me get back to enjoying the vibrations.  R.I.P. 2 My fingers.","classification":5}

{"text":"So much controversy has been generated regarding the creative merrit of this album that I truly believe it's many enjoyable qualities have been forgotton. Not only that but their are many excellent creative elements to this music as well that are even still ignored to this day for the same reason. So instead of concentrating on this album for what it isn't I'll focus this review on what it is. Throughout his career it's important to understand that George Benson was always on the cutting edge of vocal soul-pop\/jazz. Even his earliest albums such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-George-Benson-Cookbook\/dp\/B0012GMW5W\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The George Benson Cookbook<\/a>&nbsp;featured Benson singing pop songs of the day so I am not going to criticize him on this album for doing what he'd always done. The main thing that makes the difference here is that George Benson is modernizing his poppy funk-jazz here for the mid 70's and in terms of music,song selections and just his renowned playing and singing this album certainly takes the cake there. It's not very long in it's entirety but the fairly long cuts that are here are all excellent each in different ways and aside from two one vocal number the instrumentals that dominate this recording give enough time for everyone,especially Benson to strech out instrumentally. No matter how many times I've heard the title song of this album,as far as I know one of only a select few instrumentals associated with Bobby Womack and aside from the rather pretty melody these days I actually really enjoy the bluesy sort of licks gets on the final verses of the song. After having heard the original of \"This Masquerade\" on Leon Russell's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Carney\/dp\/B000002U04\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Carney<\/a>&nbsp;it gives new meaning to this one. Leon's had a deep bayou flavor to it wheras George Bensosn presents the song as something of an American pop standard with the darkness of the melody baught up to the surface even more along with George's guitar-scating signiture almost making the song into a Benson original as opposed to an interpretation. In fact the only Benson original here is the instrumetal \"So This Is Love?\" which,much like \"Lady\" and the Jose Feliciano cover \"Affirmation\" all get a great balance between soul-jazz,funk and R&B with a tempo and rhythm that variates enough to keep it really interesting and involving. \"Six To Four\" is a great pop\/funk that's a bit more uptempo and upbeat than the rest of the album and provides a nice change of pace. This album,all and all is not altogether as pop oriented as you might expect despite Claus Ogerman's flowery string arrangements and the upfront melodies and it actually serves it's purpose very well in that regard. There are plenty of very musical licks from George,Phil Upchurch and everyone else involved in the making of this album so it's not just a commercial triumph for Benson but he didn't totally compromise himself artistically either.","classification":5}

{"text":"I wonder, is there such a thing as TOO tight...as far as music goes?  Man,\nI don't think I've ever heard such a mechanical sounding background to an otherwise decent song and excellent vocals.  Jordin has such a beautiful voice, and she sings this song so well, it's too bad that every other aspect of this song has no human element whatsoever.\n\nThe parts that have that electronic kick drum sound firing off in rapid succession really take the cake (and drive me up a wall).  Every part of the music is so 'perfect', I mean there's not one note even slightly out of place.\n\nIn her future recordings, I hope she strays away from these types of songs, even if they happen to be the 'in' thing right now, because she has too good of a voice to waste it on any thing other than beautiful, emotional, human music.","classification":3}
{"text":"This song is great for the small group study. Songs which praise God are the highest achievement humanity can attain to.

Although they never have received the recognition they deserve, they if any band should definitely be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They along with other bands like Spirit and Quicksilver Messenger and Ambrosia contributed music forty years ago that sounds as good today as it did then.

I love this CD, so much in fact that I actually went to go see him in concert and it was amazing. Here is the song by song review:\n1. Grenade: 5\/5 This is hands down one of the best on the CD, though it's incredibly overplayed.\n2. Just The Way You Are: 4\/5 Its good, but its so girly, and again very overplayed.\n3. Our First Time: 2\/5 The only wrong thing with this album. Its so sexed up and nasty, I don't like it very much.\n4. Runaway Baby: 5\/5 Absolutely incredible, this is the most upbeat song on the album and its also one of my favorites.\n5. The Lazy Song: 5\/5 This song is really funny, and a fun, easy listen.\n6. Marry You: 5\/5 Yet another great song on the album, and nice upbeat tune with some mildly amusing lyrics. Just a nice song for the album.\n7. Talking to the Moon: 5\/5 I didn't realize how awesome this song was until he performed it at the concert. The thing I love most about this song it the great hook to it.\n8. Liquor Store Blues: 4\/5 It's alright, but not great. One of the weaker songs on the album. I\n9. Count on Me: 5\/5 This is just a fun little happy song, the performance at the concert was great. I just like how happy it is.\n10. The Other Side: 5\/5 This is hands down my favorite on the album, I don't care how awesome Grenade or Talking to the Moon were, but this song takes the cake. I absolutely love this song and its a perfect way to end the album.\n\nFinal Score: 9.0\/10","classification":5}

{"text":"The stars are for Isaac Hayes - this needless reissue gets NONE! Nothing here that has not been available many times before - the Japanese SHM-CD re-release earlier this year had better sound than this (although it was released as a facsimile of the UK Stax release not the US Enterprise original for some reason) and the re-mix of the title song was totally unnecessary - unless of course you - like Concord - are desperately trying to exploit the Stax catalog.\nThere is nothing remotely of interest on this CD - but if you are a diehard Black Moses fan - seek out the Shaft Anthology on FSM (Vol 11 #8) for the actual MGM soundtrack that was recorded ahead of the Enterprise hit version. And for a remaster that is spine tingling - totally comparable to the Beatles Remasters program- go to Barry White's \"Unlimited\" box set on Hip O - well worth the investment!!\nWhen Concord acquired Fantasy and the Stax catalog a few years back they made a lot of noise how they were going to respect and promote the Memphis Sound and honor its legacy. The Stax website folded a year or so ago and the stuff that Concord has released has been less than notable - \"Stax does Motown\", \"Stax does the Beatles\" - hey how about \"Stax does TARP?\" Two lackluster \"new\" CDs from Eddie Floyd and Steve Cropper just about sum it up. When one looks back fondly  to the Atlantic Box set, the two Fantasy box sets and the numerous Ace UK Stax re-releases - one can only conclude that no-one at Concord - not even Bill Belmont  if he is stlll there- cares for anything but the money and they won't earn it with thoughtless re-issues like this.","classification":3}

Oh, my-oh-my indeed. Here's the straight poop from the band's site......\n\nThe last of a three-night run at a mysterious little club called \"Thelma\" found the GRATEFUL DEAD restoring glory to the Sunset Strip for what was once just a fleeting moment, now preserved for eternity with this here Dave's Picks Volume 10. Hot off the release of the highly-acclaimed Live\/Dead and setting the stage for 'Workingman's Dead', 12\/12\/69 stands to represent the crux of the band's musical past, present, and future. Witness the first signs of country, folk, and Americana infiltrating an otherwise wildly experimental and anarchic period, evidenced by Pigpen-driven classics like \"I'm A King Bee,\" \"Hard To Handle,\" \"Good Lovin'\" and a whopping 30 minute+ version of \"Turn On Your Lovelight,\" as well as over a half dozen then-new compositions which show the Garcia\/Hunter songwriting duo elevating the Dead to higher ground. Thelma turns the heat up indeed!\n\nThe only complaint I have is regarding the mix. Although I've never been a big fan of Tom Constanten's keyboard contributions, I have to admit he really shines here, unfortunately he's way down in the mix. Constanten isn't a great improviser like the underrated Keith Godchaux, and almost sinks some of the 'LIVE\/DEAD' recordings, but by the time of this show he'd been with the band over a year and sounds very organically integrated. Most of the DEAD's pre-Brent Myland concert recordings give short-shrift to the keyboards in the mix, on those where they're on an equal footing with the guitars greatly improves the group's dynamics. Constanten's tenure with the band was only to last another seven weeks, quitting after the infamous New Orleans bust.* Pigpen more than picked up the slack however, his contributions on organ throughout the Europe '72 shows are a revelation but sadly also the last testament to the band founder, and arguably it's soul and inspiration. I'm sure many will disagree, but the less said about Brent Myland, the better......\n\nMastered in HDCD from the original soundboard recordings produced by Owsley Stanley, featuring the once lost, now found first reel, this is one full show you won't want to miss.

We get the best of the GRATEFUL DEAD on a cusp, great tracks and features from 'Anthem Of The Sun' and 'Aoxomoxoa' AND seven out of eight tracks from the then unreleased 'Workingman's Dead,' which wouldn't be recorded until Feb. 1970 or released until June 1970. It's ironic that the only track from 'Workingman's Dead' not performed is \"New Speedway Boogie,\" written by Garcia\/Hunter about the disastrous concert at Altamont Speedway Free Festival, which ironically took place only four days before their residency at THELMA. Jerry and Robert probably either hadn't written it yet or were in the process. Surprisingly, this factoid isn't mentioned ONCE in the accompanying booklet, even though it mentions the previous riots on Sunset Strip that occurred in the vicinity of THELMA. Also, in less than two months keyboardist Tom Constanten would leave the band after their notorious New Orleans bust, enshrined for all time in \"Truckin'\"......\n\nIf you're an all-around Deadhead you'll love this set, if it's the \"Pigpen Era\" that makes you wanna \"load up your shotgun, an' while away the time,\" it's manna......\n\n* there's a great eight disc \"grey area\" set on the Why\/Arts label titled \"Opening Of The Warehouse\" documenting their three day stand from January 30 to February 1, 1970 at the new New Orleans venue during which the famous \"set up like a bowling pin\" bust occurred after the first night, which also resulted in the resignation of keyboardist Tom Constanten (who with Pigpen were the only two not involved). The set includes their great acoustic second set from January 31st and partial recordings of sets by opening acts THE FLOCK and FLEETWOOD MAC (with Peter Green and Danny Kirwan). Highly recommended.......\n\nUPDATE (6\/20\/14): The GRATEFUL DEAD are about to let one of the two filmed EUROPE '72 shows out of the vault!

There are also many great officially unreleased pre-1972 DEAD performances, on the rare Wicker's World and Hippie Temptation TV shows, a great live two song set (\"Mountains Of The Moon\" and \"St. Stephen\") on the syndicated TV show Playboy's Penthouse, the rest of their Woodstock set (MUCH better than the released \"Lovelight\"), the complete 2\/4\/70 Family Dog and 2\/14\/70 Filmore shows (around in bootleg quality), performances left off the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Festival-Express\/dp\/B00H9GJRSY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Festival Express<\/a>&nbsp;DVD, The \"Celebration\" performances on KQED, and footage filmed for French TV.  The band is running out of time to release these classic video performances before the audience is no longer around to buy them. The pre-1972 footage, if remastered and documented by those involved still alive would make a dynamite 2-3 hour film which would be devoured by Deadhead's. If the band's worried about production costs why not crowd-source-fund it? Oh well, it's 2014, and Corporate DEAD is better than no DEAD (unless YOU'RE dead!)......","classification":5}

{"text":"\"Whistle\" is a song by American rapper Flo Rida from his fourth album Wild Ones (2012). It was released on April 24, 2012 as the third single from the album. \"Whistle\" was written by Flo Rida, David Glass, Marcus Killian, Justin Franks, Breyan Isaac and Antonio Mobley while production was handled by DJ Frank E and Glass. It is a song about oral sex.\n\"Whistle\" is a pop-rap song characterized by a whistling melody. Upon its release, the song received mostly mixed reviews from music critics. They generally praised its pop sound, noting that it had the potential of becoming another hit with its \"catchy\" hook. However, several critics gave a negative review for the lyrics, interpreted as a thinly veiled euphemism for oral sex, calling it \"the least subtle song ever\". The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Flo Rida's third number one hit and his first since 2009's \"Right Round\".[2] \"Whistle\" was a commercial success, topping the charts in some countries, including Australia, Israel and Sweden, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in others, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom.\nAn accompanying music video for the song, directed by Marc Klasfeld, was released on May 24, 2012. It was filmed in Acapulco, Mexico and makes use of split screen at various points. It mostly shows shots of Flo Rida and several girls on a beach. Upon its release, it received positive to mixed reviews from critics, who noted that it was a perfect accompaniment for the song. Flo Rida also promoted the song by performing it during the finale of the talent show, The Voice. This song is the second track on Now 44. The cover image of the single also drew praise for its subtlety and originality.","classification":5}

{"text":"Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\"; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson. We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic. Whether we are asleep with this beautiful song 'secreting' itself into our memory or 'relaxing' in our romantic, nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning, enrichment, and themes so present in this joyous, uplifting recording. \"Just send for me, oh baby.\"\n\n\"Remember the day I set you free\nI told you you could always count on me\nFrom that day on, I made a vow,\nI'll be there when you want me,\nSome way, some how.\n\n'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,\nAin't no valley low enough,\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you babe.\n\nMy love is alive\nWay down in my heart\nAlthough we are miles apart\nIf you ever need a helping hand,\nI'll be there on the double\nAs fast as I can.\nDon't you know that there\n\nAin't no mountain high enough,\nAin't no valley low enough,\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you babe.\"","classification":5}

{"text":"Well go buy or listen to those albums.  Because this album is NOT meant to be a continuation of those albums. I had to get that myself after the 1st listen. This album threw me way off initially because naturally I had The Chronics in my mind and I have been waiting 16 yrs for a new Dre album. So this album was set up for failure before I even played it. But after multiple spins now, I really like this album. I can't stop wanting to play it. Its Dre for 2015, simple as that. Props to him for updating his sound without selling out to sound too young. This album is not about super lyricism or just having a good time. Its about being a elder in the game and reminding us, while showing a new gen, why Dre is considered the best producer ever in the game. I can't say I was blown away by any of the new talent. So if I have to find something to knock, that would be it. But they played their roles very well on this album. I like how he has older school, mid-school, and newer school artists all involved in this project here and there. All in all, as of now, I feel this is a good addition to his legacy. And a nice way to go out.\n\nLyrics- C+\nProduction- A-\nEntertainment- B+","classification":4}

{"text":"What an awesome album ! It's a new favorite. I really enjoy the amazing energy of the Robert Randolph Family Band like most listeners, but this album has a lot of dimension and depth beyond just hot licks. Another Robert Randolph Family fan states the case well in their review, \"remember, it's a studio album\". Robert explains the group's approach to this album in the liner notes, the music created out of collective study of music the producer T. Bone Burnett brought to the musician's attention as seed for new creative directions.\n  The American heritage of music is so unbelievably rich, adventurous listeners often find new musical styles and inspiration. With so much of our musical heritage the creative genius of black Americans and based in the Afro-American experience, a group as talented as these folks just need a little nudge to set their creativity on fire. I think that the more varied moods and tones of this cd really emphasize the incredible talent and power of Robert's steel playing.\n  When these guys get it cranked-up no one can resist the infectious energy, but I think this group has much more to offer than tune after tune with the throttle to the floor. Some of the more mellow moments on the cd are particularly enchanting, showcasing outstanding vocals, and soaring Robert solos. I don't seek out Christian themed music, but anyone who loves roots music knows that spirituals and gospel have played a huge part in our musical past in both black and white communities. The presentation of Christian themes in some of their tunes comes across more as generic songs of hope in our shared human condition, whatever religion we may ascribe to. Give this baby a whirl, they're doing something special here.","classification":5}

{"text":"It is listed that American Woman by The Guess Who is not a patriotic song, but a controversial anti-war song.  However, I admit that I enjoy this song because of the catchy song and the well placed instruments.  As per the songfacts website, apparently this song was so popular when it first came out that the Guess Who group performed in the White House Lawn in 1970 (because Richard Nixons daughter Tricia was listed to be a fan of the group).Additionally even with me liking this song,  Im actually a very proud patriotic American woman  who is pro-military and has deep roots\/ties to American culture (both my adoptive parents were born as U.S. citizens and both my late maternal grandmother and late biological mother were registered members of the Menominee Indian tribe in Wisconsin). I also credit first hearing Lenny Kravitzs American Woman (which is also a good version to listen to) during my high school years as to contributing to why I can also easily enjoy American Woman by The Guess Who.","classification":5}

{"text":"Has anyone REALLY listened to the lyrics? Better yet, has any thought gone into the nuanced meaning of the album's title, Drones? The artwork alone speaks volumes. After looking at the track list of the album it is clear the subject that Muse is attempting to tackle.\n\nPsycho, the first release, is offensive and makes the listener uncomfortable. And it should. Not because of a few obscenities sprinkled in to represent a military leader trying to break a recruit but because of what the song represents. We are in a culture now where if you disagree with the masses and have unique, independent, questioning thoughts about anything, you may as well accept being subjected to ridicule, judgment and sideways glances. \"You're not on *insert drone site here*? Why? What's wrong with you?\" Muse is not afraid to go after anyone or anything, which is why they are my favorite group by a long mile. By the way, this is hardly the first song of theirs that has an obscenity in it.\n\nPsycho clearly represents turning someone impressionable, wandering through the world, like a drone, into a cold-blooded killer through the power of words, suggestion and calculated phrases. This is heard in the exchange between an assumed military leader and a recruit. This song is about controlling the controllable because, well because they can. There is a line in the song, \"I could use someone like you. Someone who'll kill on my command and ask no questions.\" I don't think this requires explanation, does it?\n\nThis song is hardly a sell-out, if anything it's one of the more controversial songs they have released. The 2nd Law's Animals about the 1% comes close, as does MK Ultra, about the governments mind-control program, from The Resistance. Muse knows exactly what they are doing and I applaud them for having the chutzpah. Political correctness is horse crap. Self-censoring so no one's feelings are hurt is horse crap. Life is too short to worry about what someone says about you on the \"drone\" sites. Live, love and relax, we'll all be dead before we know it...just don't die a drone.","classification":5}

{"text":"There is so much you can absolutely say about Weird Al Yankovic. Not only does he make funny songs, and mend excellent pop parody. But mostly all of the time, he delivers a song that can be much more funny and laughable than the original hit. That showed for years in so many songs like Fat and Smells Like Nirvana. His latest set of parodies are absolutely divine and still just one of a kind in great music. His latest single, Word Crimes, which is a great knock-off of Robin Thicke's hit Blurred Lines. While I didn't like Blurred Lines, this song is absolutely great. It is a excellent and funny song, and it still shows when the right song comes up, there will continues to be hilarious parody that will be sometimes even better than the original song, and this song is a great add-on for your music library that shows this is no word crime, just a great barrel of laughs.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4}

{"text":"This is still the lushest of all the Bee Gees' albums, unless you count the late, great CUCUMBER CASTLE.  That alone makes it worth hearing a few hundred times but my, oh my- -those songs.  I don't know what the rift was over the band's direction that temporarily broke them up (a family affair, you see), but whatever it was the Brothers rose above the occasion and created one of the finest records of the glorious, inglorious Sixties.  It was their last of that decade, and everything they'd done previous to it, great as it may have been, was merely prelude.  In England ODESSA was released as a red-velvet two-LP box set; in the States as a red-velvet double LP with a remarkably green disaster-at-sea insert.  You could put the thing on your coffee table (or floor, or kitchen counter) and let it speak for itself, or you could lie back and immerse yourself in its velvety sonic ocean.  Or both, with or without headphones.  Okay, that may be overstating it, but ODESSA contains some of the Brothers' finest compositions, ranging from the story-telling prog-rock of the title track (the cello solo is an ingenious touch) to the lighter-than-air, lovely 'Melody Fair' to the oboe-chugged, acoustic 'Suddenly' (Maurice was always the underappreciated contributor) to the desperately haunted 'Sound Of Love'.  Heck, they even included an international anthem that actually sounds like one, the prescient globalists!!  And two other orchestral instrumentals to boot!  And- -'Lamplight'!! You want goofy instead?  Okay, 'Give Your Best', and 'Never Say Never Again'! There! These guys are awesome!  Now, stop me before I start raving about how incredible CUCUMBER CASTLE is!!","classification":5}

The use of the \"Cups\" on tables in the method on the video I see at parties all the time, (difficult to do, but everyone gets a kick out of it).

The only difference is that Marilyn Mansons version is a grittier\/darker remake.  Im guessing-from reading online meanings of the song-that the basic summary behind Marilyn Mansons version is the controversial notion of a person witnessing both people being abused and those that are the abusers themselves (which Im guessing can apply to either personal or professional\/career settings).  I myself am lucky to have a loving husband so fortunately this song is not life imitates art for me.

If you aren't a counter tenor fan already these tracks won't change your opinion (I don't mind counter tenor sound as long as it's crystal clear in vocal quality and these performances aren't). Most of the popular choral carols get a nice cover. German Bass solos are a nice surprise!

{"text":"It took me awhile to formulate a solid opinion on \"Tokyo Dome in Concert,\" Van Halen's latest live release (and the basis for their current tour). I was initially put off from it almost instantly by David Lee Roth's vocals, which are problematic to say the least; he's off-key, out of breath and his phrasing and timing are way out of synch. Roth was never the strongest live singer and has always had limited range, but he really sounds torn to shreds on some songs here. However, his charisma is alive and well, and you got to admire how willing he is to go out there in the face of such criticism.\n\nSo what makes \"Tokyo Dome\" such a worthwhile listen? Well, Eddie for one. It seems with each recent tour, Eddie gets better as Dave gets worse: the 2007 tour had Dave in excellent voice and Eddie's playing was solid but still a bit rough around the edges (but several universes removed from the train wreck he was on the 2004 tour, his undisputed low point as a musician and human). Fast forward to 2012-13, and Eddie is now playing excellent, as evidenced on this record: Eddie's playing is fast, clean and furious, and recent videos have showcased that he has only improved on the current tour, while Dave's voice is just gone. Alex still rocks the skins, and while Michael Anthony is sorely missed, there's no denying that Wolfgang is more than competent.\n\nEven if Dave struggles often, he still rises from the ashes on occasion, and there are some all around solid performances on this disc: the opening shot of \"Unchained\" and \"Runnin' with the Devil\" is just fantastic, the new songs from \"A Different Kind of Truth\" all come off well, and \"And the Cradle Will Rock\" is just a monster here; Roth is on vocally and Eddie is just a monster here. The encore is a lot of fun, even if Roth is REALLY pushing the limits here.\n\nThe sound is good, a nice live sound, and the packaging is pretty cool. This is not definitive live VH by any means, but a solid release overall.","classification":4}

Written by the legendary Elton John, Scissor Sisters single handily bring back the dance scene, if only for a few gay, happy, short minutes. But really folks, you can't get through this song without at least tapping your toes. In fact, Larry Craig probably did his scandalous foot things to this song.\n\nThis song is incredibly catchy, and impossible not to love once you get into it. And the dance factor is cranked up to max here. Whether it be in a closet, or an empty room, or a bar, or a club, rest assured, you'll dance at some point. The vocals, the beats, and the music completely fit the song. And in fact, the structure is perfect for creating all those classic dance vibes.\n\nOverall, a pleasurable experience that really brings back the true dance movement. Not those thumping, trance remixes they put out today, but the quality stuff. So check out this song, you probably haven't heard it here, but it was a huge hit in Britain, so see what you're missing, cause this song is just plain fun.","classification":5}

Instead of sounding tired and worn out, the song is actually a great listen.  Barber has a warm voice, and it carries the song through its mostly bare instrumentation.  The song works up into a crescendo involving strings, male harmonies, and piano.  The best thing about \"Never Quit Loving You\" is that it's an extraordinarily simple melody, but the song is packed with so much nuance that repeated listens are rewarded with finding new touches.\n\nFans of Norah Jones will probably enjoy this song as well.

The booklet included with the CDs adds depth to the sung story, not to mention Greg Hildebrandt's wonderful art deserves admiration.\n\nI think this quotation is what I will take away: Do not dwell on the monstrous injustices done by humanity to humanity, since the dawn of mankind, more than you study how these wrongs and injustices were corrected. The study of the individuals and civilizations that overcame these evils is the key to mankind moving forward.\n\nIf you enjoy the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, I think you will like this. Do go ahead and get the physical album.","classification":5}

{"text":"This album by Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard is superb.  My favorite song is \"It's Only Money\".  This song changes my attitude about making money.  I should not be so driven to make money because it is spent so quickly.  I can relate to the lyrics.  I like the upbeat tempo with the saxophone playing on It's Only Money\".  I really like the song  \"Alice In Hulaland\". The steel pedal guitar gives this song a laid back Hawaiian music tone that I enjoy.  \"Django and Jimmie\" is a tribute song to two early 20th century musicians.  Django was a guitarist who inspired Willie Nelson. Jimmie Rodgers was an expert yodeler who inspired Merle Haggard to sing.  It is great to hear the about the musical influences of these legends in a song. \"Good Ol Johnny Cash\" is another tribute song to a music legend.  I don't mind tribute songs if they are either touching or humorous.  This song about Johnny Cash is.  I love the piano playing on the song  \"Family Bible.\" I love the lyrics, even though I haven't read the Bible that much in my life.  I like the sentiment of a family sitting down to listen to a father read from the Bible. The coziness of a bar is captured in the song \"Swinging Doors\".  This is a great country song.  \"Live This Long\" is a song that reflects on the amazing lives these two men have led.  I hope to live long enough to sing a song like this. This is an entertaining album.","classification":5}

And Song For Guy is soothing to the soul. The piano touches are quite special.\n\nElton explores many styles on this recording as opposed to sticking with a constant arrangment as he has done on previous recordings such as Caribou and Madman Accross The Water.  This is a good thing.  Howeve, the last few songs are pretty unmemorable in the hook department.  Others midway through the record have pleasant arrangments but lack a strong melody.\n\nTherefore, this is a good recording but not on the same level as Elton's prime time era or even The One or Too Low For Zero.","classification":3}

{"text":"I've been lookin at the reviews tearing this album apart and I don't get it. It's been like 20 years since \"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\" and \"36 Chambers\" and people are still expecting to hear that same sound from Rae and the rest of the Wu. Rae in particular has always made his own direction and had an independent way of doing things. Anyway, Raekwon is in top lyrical flow and form here. There's no doubt that the beats, the production, the background music, and even the guests, are a mix of old school and modern. The mistake that alot of people are making is thinking that's a bad thing. The modern guests will never outshine Rae but that's a really good thing. At the same time, they actually compliment the songs they're on. Snoop is on his A-game (ferocious) and so is Ghost. The whole sound of \"Fly International Luxuruious Art\" combines the old and the new to make a unique special sound. This is more thought out than \"Lex Diamonds\", has better backing beats and music than \"Immobilarity\", and as good as \"Shaolin Vs. Wu-Tang\" was, this is more original and feels fresher than that. Raekwon fans buy this, Wu-Tang fans who like their later work get this, and anyone who likes rap should check this.

{"text":"Since the USA Armed Forces withdrew their radio stations from Europe\nwe lost the possibility to listen to Country Music. That's why we\nalso lost track on many artists we knew then. One example is Ed Bruce\na rockabilly singer who was popular in the late 50's and a SUN artist\ntogether with all the great legends like Elvis, Jerry Lee, Roy Orbison,\nJohnny Cash, Carl Perkins etc. He was nicknamed \"Jerry Lee Lewis' brother\"\nHe then suddenly \"disappeared\" until I saw him on a DVD Country Family\nShow from Nasville; an old grey man with a grey mustache was announced\nby Bill Anderson, the host, as Ed Bruce. I couln't believe it! After 43\nyears this rockabilly star from the heydays of Rock & Roll sat there\nand sang a wonderful country song called \"My first taste of Texas\".\nI immediately consulted all Billboard books and found out that he\nturned to country in 1967 and had built up quite a carreer until 1987.\nThe next step was to look at Amazon's music chapter and there were\nseveral CD's available being this one the chosen one because of the\nprevious mentioned \"My first taste of Texas\".

{"text":"Most of the time when I buy a CD, I listen to it a few times and then put it back on the shelf for weeks or months at a time before I give it another listen. There are occasions, however, when I buy a CD and it really grabs a hold of me. On these rare occasions, I become engrossed, almost addicted to the album. Martha Wainwright's self-titled debut has been one of these occasions.\n\nBecause of who her family is, it would be easy to immediately dismiss her as \"the sister of Rufas,\" or \"the daughter of Louden and Kate McGarrigle.\" This would be a mistake, because Martha Wainwright's music is distinctly unique and she is a huge talent in her own right.\n\nHer voice is gorgeous, but not in a traditional sense. Her voice has a soulful, high-pitched, eerie beauty, like nothing I've ever heard before. In her delivery, there is a real sense of emotion and feeling that really connects with the listener. With most albums, when you are done listening, you are done. When you are finished with Martha Wainwright's album, you feel as though you had just been visited by a presence, and that feeling stays with you, long after the CD has ended.\n\nFrom the opening \"Far Away\", the listener is immediately swept into the CD. This song is subtle, building up ever so slightly, and is slightly underwhelming, which gives the song the perfect effect. The hauntingly beautiful background vocals add a nice touch. The more upbeat \"G.P.T.\" has an infectious, singsong verse before going into its' soulful chorus. The bluesy morose \"Factory\" shows a more vulnerable side to Martha Wainwright. \"These Flowers\" has a kind-of a dream-like lullaby atmosphere. \"Ball and Chain,\" (not a cover of the classic Janis Joplin song) sounds somewhat Janis-Joplin like. It is here that Wainwright lets down all restraints and finally lets all that had been building up inside her explode. \"Why does this always happen?\" she yells, demanding an answer, yet knowing none will come. The album comes back to earth with the beautiful \"Don't forget\" a song about lost love. These types of songs are so clich,' but Wainwright sounds so sincere, and this song feels so lived in, that it's impossible not to be moved. The tongue-in-cheek \"This Life,\" tries to answer the question of whether the monotony of life in general is worth living. The light percussion over the subtle strumming of the acoustic strings creates the perfect backdrop for the song. Although it is asked whether or not suicide is the answer, this seemingly heavy-handed topic does not emotionally drain the listener the way an Alice In Chains song might. It's as though these suicidal ideas are just passing thoughts, not to be taken seriously. The catchy mid-paced \"When the day is Short,\" keeps the momentum going. The brutally honest \"Bloody Mother F***ing A** Hole\" is one of the album's centerpieces. You'd expect a song with a title like that to sound like Hole or Babes In Toyland, but that's not the case at all. This acoustic song starts out very subtle, building up angst as it rolls along, as though the hurt and resentment inside had been building up a long time and now is being vented out. But when Wainwright delivers the main lines \"you bloody mother f***ing A** hole,\" she sounds more hurt than angry. \"I will not pretend, I will not put on a smile, I will not say I'm alight for you, for you, whoever you are.\" In other words, she is taking a stand, against anyone who would try to supress her, or not let her be herself. The explicit content sounds especially powerful because it comes out of left field. It's really unexpected. It's not like an Eminem album where every-other word is f*** this and f*** that. The bluesy easy-going \"TV Show\" has an engrossing stream-like lyrical flow. There's an array of strings in the background that are effective, yet subtle. The singsong \"Maker\" is enchanting, especially when the lush array of background vocals in the chorus kick in. The somber stripped-down acoustic \"Who was I kidding\" is heavyhearted, yet not overdone. The elegant piano balled \"Whiter I Must Wander\" is the perfect way to close out the album, ending on a whisper.\n\nMartha Wainwright's debut is a truly wonderful listen, through and through. It's brutally honest, yet not melodramatic, confident, yet never cocky. Martha Wainwright is an amazing and very promising talent. One of the best CDs of 2005.","classification":5}

{"text":"Amy Winehouse is big in the UK and it comes as a surprise to many that this album is not her first, indeed her 2003 \"Frank\" album foreshadows the success of her second album, which was 3 years in the making.\n\n\"Back to Black\" (11 tracks, 36 min.) starts off with the song that has given Amy her breakthrough in the US, the quirky \"Rehab\", which is actually not nearly the best song on this set. Much better are for example the stomping \"You Know I'm No Good\", and the title track (with biting lines like \"We said goodbye with words\/I died a hundred times\/You go back to her\/And I go back to black\", wow). Also interesting is \"Tears Dry On Their Own\", which reflects Amy's strong influence by the Motown sound--this song hums along perfectly along with \"Ain't No Montains High Enough\". The album closes with a second version of \"You Know I'm No Good\", with a guest-rapper (I think it badly misfires).\n\nI happen to catch Amy live at the Coachella festival a few months ago, and there is no denying her stage presence, and her house band was stellar. That said, I don't know if at this point her mainstream success in the US (the album is a mainstay in the Top 10 of the Billboard 200) is due to the music, or the phenomenon that she seems to have become. Only the future will tell whether \"Back to Black\" was a one-time, quirky smash, or whether Amy can continue to build from there. For another album in the same vein, check out Lily Allen's debut album \"Alright, Still\".","classification":4}

{"text":"Were all familiar with Rachmaninoffs major orchestral works now, with this collection, youll hear some of his less familiar work less familiar, maybe, but no less important in their mental intensity.  The earliest composer in my personal history is Rachmaninoff.  His music filled our home even before I walked.  If you are considering this collection, well then, you probably had a similar childhood.  Low cost mp3's have opened the doors to important music.  I sit at my keyboard and Pro-Tools and impress my friends, but real composers think it out in their heads. The entire orchestra lives in their brain. They may, on their piano, experiment with novel juxtapositioning of new note groupings; but the final voicing takes place in their brain, and then, only then, do they take it to paper. This is how the biggies did and still do it... Beethoven, Brahma, Schoenberg, Handel, Vivaldi, Boulez, Debussy, Clementi, Leonhardt... and many, many more. This is a quality missing from most current composition, certainly missing in my method.  All cuts are of excellent technical and artistic quality, quality you expect from a VOX recording.","classification":5}

{"text":"I saw there was this new Cyndi Lauper album and as a child of the 80's, I was powerless to try and not listen. Right from the start you can hear this is not pandering to the Girls Just Wanna Have Fun style that made her famous. This has an entirely different sound that you're used to hearing from Lauper. And it's good. It's deffinately got a more bluegrassy country sound with some other genres tossed in sporadically.\n\nThis is a cover album with Lauper doing what I assume are some of her personal favorite song from various artists. She does a great job.\n\n Funnel Of Love - (Cover of the Wanda Jackson song) This has an awesome sound. It's like techno southwestern blues (apparently that's a thing). The lyrics are so-so but Lauper's voice has aged very well. She sounds amazing on vocals.\n\n Detour - (Cover of the classic Willie Nelson \/ Leon Russell song) It's got Emmy Lou Harris signing with her so it's got to be good. Personally I'm a huge fan of women covering songs made famous by men or men coving songs made famous by women. The dramatic change in the vocal sounds when that's done makes it a whole new song that you've already loved for years. Lauper and Harris do this classic justice.\n\n Misty Blue - (Cover of a classic written by Bob Montgomery that has been recorded by numerous artists in several genres over the years) Remember when Lauper followed up Girls Just Wanna Have Fun with Time After Time to show she had dynamic range as an artist? Same thing here. This is an easy slow ballad and a beautiful song. Lauper can really sing.\n\n Walkin' After Midnight - (Cover of the super classic Patsy Cline song) - If you mess with Patsy Cline songs, you better do it right because I have no tolerance for screwing up her music. Lauper does this cover right. Patsy Cline still sounds better because....Patsy Cline...hello! But Cyndi Lauper does it very well.\n\n Heartaches By The Number  (Cover of a song originally written by Harlan Howard, but has been redone a bazillion times by every country singer since 1959)  Its hard to cover a song thats already been covered to death and not have it be totally generic. Lauper brings back her 1980s voice set to a country beat to make this one stand out. By that mean I she does her things where she trails off the end of words by going really high pitched for a note. It sounds great.\n\n The End Of The World - (Cover of the Skeeter Davis version, not the REM version) This is a classic oldies slow song, not a country or bluegrass song like the rest of the album. Its okay. Lauper does it justice.\n\nNight Life  (Duet with Willie Nelson signing a classic Willie Nelson song) I don't think its technically a cover when the original artist is dueting the song with you. Laupers voice somehow doesnt come through well on this song. And Willie Nelson sounds rough. That physically pains me to say that. But Nelson is not at his best here.\n\n Begging To You  (Cover of a Marty Robbins song) Im not familiar with the original so I cant say how this version compares. But as a stand alone its okay. Its not the best song on the album but its okay.\n\n Youre The Reason Our Kids Are Ugly  (Cover of the Loretta Lynn \/ Conway Twitty song) Vince Gill joins Cyndi Lauper on this one. Hes great with up beat country songs so hes perfect to duet with on this one. The two of them make this one awesome. Its such a fun song and they do it right.\n\n I Fall To Pieces  (Cover of one of THE Patsy Cline songs. Not just any song. But one of Clines all time best) Wow. Cyndi Lauper owns this! The music is nearly identical to the original. Lauper isn't doing a rendition of the original here so much as shes signing exactly like Patsy Cline did. You kind of have to do that with this song because its such an all time classic you just cant change it. And Lauper does a great job. This one is fantastic.\n\n I Want To Be A Cowboys Sweetheart  (Cover of a song originally done by Rubye Blevins way back in 1935 that has been covered a few times since) Lauper reached way back on this one and brings Jewel along for the ride. Its got a very old sound because its an 81 year old song. It features yodeling as a primary vocal elementwhich I believe is Jewel contributingthough I must say that is not something I ever expected to hear from Jewel. And it features the accordion as a prominent instrument. Againnothing something I ever expected from Cyndi Lauper. But you know what? It sounds really cool!\n\n Hard Candy Christmas  (Cover of the Dolly Parton song) Allison Krauss, of Allison Krauss and Union Station fame, duets with Lauper here. This is not a Christmas song if you're not familiar. It just has Christmas in the lyrics. Its a Dolly Parton classic. These two do a great job.","classification":5}

{"text":"There is honestly a lack from female singers of today. They sincerely have not made songs that drove from the soul of the heart, and instead have had a lot of songs that really have been more cheesy than a strike from the soul within. Honestly, there can be more patience to make a song strike well. Demi Lovato has had only a few songs that worked very nicely from that place, like Skyscraper and some other ones. But honestly, she has tried to be more in your face in the way other artists like Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna have been, and sadly she has lagged from a strong inner soul. Her latest song, Confident, the second track and title track from third album is definitely a song that I didn't feel was a strong presence. Instead the song has been more of a waste than Cool For The Summer was. I really found this song to be one of her weakest songs overall. I hope the next single can bring out more confidence from the lack on the soul that this one showed.\n\nSong: D","classification":2}

{"text":"Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\"; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson. We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic. Whether we are asleep with this beautiful song 'secreting' itself into our memory or 'relaxing' in our romantic, nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning, enrichment, and themes so present in this joyous, uplifting recording. \"Just send for me, oh baby.\"\n\n\"Remember the day I set you free\nI told you you could always count on me\nFrom that day on, I made a vow,\nI'll be there when you want me,\nSome way, some how.\n\n'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,\nAin't no valley low enough,\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you babe.\n\nMy love is alive\nWay down in my heart\nAlthough we are miles apart\nIf you ever need a helping hand,\nI'll be there on the double\nAs fast as I can.\nDon't you know that there\n\nAin't no mountain high enough,\nAin't no valley low enough,\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you babe.\"","classification":5}

{"text":"There are sometimes so few songs that are just so timeless that they have never gone out of style. Especially when it has came down to love ballads from the 80's. Atlantic Starr though has been one of those groups that has made some excellent R&B songs, but they have honestly been written off as a group that has been more syrupy than a group known for substance. That has been because of numerous lineup changes, but also lagging sales and credibility. Still they have had great ballads like All In The Name Of Love, Masterpiece and Touch A Four Leaf Clover. But out of all the ballads they have cranked out as a whole, the one song that has really stood simply out of the horizon, Always has been one of those timeless songs that has really spoke from the heart. The intimacy of the ballad still is one of those love songs that I never get tired of. If you really want to hear a timeless love song, this is one I sincerely recommend downloading to your music library.\n\nSong: A-","classification":5}

{"text":"My best buddy from senior high school told me about this band recently.  I picked up the set after he raved about \"Hall of Fame.\"  It's a very strong set.  My favorite track on the set is \"Glowing\" with its pumping beat and a lyric that sounds like a plot outline from a Julia Roberts movie, \"I woke up this morning to a kiss just like a whisper, an empty suitcase, and I knew that you were gone.\"  \"No Words\" also has me reach for the repeat button with its airy background vocals, great keyboard wall of sound, and the lyric that traces the search for romance in a less-than-romantic world, \"I could talk all day long about dreams, sewing up your heart so you never see a seam.\"  The CD concludes with another great track, \"Millionaires,\" that is catchy and sticks in your ear.  While #3 is my intro to this band, it certainly warrants further exploration of this excellent band.  Enjoy!","classification":4}

{"text":"Numb by Abica was a hard album for me to review. The band sent me a promo CD and I've listened to it a number of times trying to figure out how a feel about it. It isn't a style I normally listen to, so I want to be as objective as possible. The music doesn't want you to be objective though. It wants you to feel and get deep down into it.\n\nIf forced to classify it, rap-rock with and industrial influence is as close as I can come. I think Tac and Hash are really trying to something unique here. In some instances they succeed wonderfully while in others they fall back in to cliche. Their rap interplay works well yet their singing voices leave a little to be desired. The big strength of Numb is its the lyrics. Very well thought out, you really get into their heads. These songs are brimming with emotion, though I'd say the predominant one is angst. The F-bomb gets dropped frequently, but it only serves to emphasize the more meaningful lyrics.\n\nMusically I really dig most of Abica's songs. There are some very cool things going on in the songs and repeat listens are needed to pick out some of the more subtle stuff. I'd compare them to Trent Reznor, but their studio wizardry isn't quite to that level. Yet. It is well on it's way and very listenable. I'd just like to hear a bit more dynamic range and a slightly less \"processed\" sound. While Abica covers a wide range of topics and a few different styles, in the end it one song comes out sounding a bit like the next. But if you want strong beats, emotionally driven lyrics and catchy hooks, then maybe that isn't such a bad thing. It has grown on me and I am willing to bet that album #2 takes things to the next level.\n\nStandouts for me:\n\nWhat You See\nNumb\nMy Song\nBlurry\nThe Things You Think I Say\nTake This Away\nNever That Far Away\nNothing Here\nBeautiful\nGave Em A Reason","classification":4}

{"text":"Mudcrutch is Tom Petty's original band from Gainesville (yes, from before the Heartbreakers), so it was quite the event when Mudcrutch finally released its debut album in 2008. Frankly, I was a bit disappointed, as it all sounded a bit disjoined and hap-hazard. Now, almost a decade later, comes the band's second album.\n\n\"2\" (11 tracks; 43 min.) opens with several solid Petty songs: the opener \"Trailer\", and \"Dreams of Flying\", the latter being a classic Petty tune. \"Beautiful Blue\" is a country-leaning ballad, with a lush sound. Then comes the first non-Petty song, Randall Marsh's '70s-sounding \"Beautiful World\". So as it turns out, Petty wrote 7 of the 11 songs on here, and the other 4 members of Mudcrutch each write\/sing\/take one song under their belt. Of the 4 non-Petty songs, my least favorite is Tom Leadon's \"The Other Side of the Mountain\", just too country for me (and this is obviously a very subjective take on it, I'm sure others may indeed like this tune a lot). My favorite non-Petty tune is Mike Campbell's \"Victim of Circumstance\", a romping and (too) short (2 1\/2 min.)  rocker of a tune. (The 4th non-Petty tune is Benmont Tench's \"Welcome to Hell\", which is quite good too.) One more Petty highlight for me is the Wilburys-reminding \"Save the Water\", But overall, I am quite surprised how cohesive it all sounds, in particular as compared to the first album. \"2\" is a solid listen, and a quick one too, which is perfect. Every album should be 43 min.\n\nMudcrutch has a bunch of concert dates lined up starting next week, including, I'm very happy to say, at the Bunbury music festival here in Cincinnati the first weekend of June, where they are one of the top names of the three day fest. I can't wait for that! So looking forward to hearing how these new songs will resonate in a live setting. Meanwhile \"2' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n*UPDATE* I saw Mudcrutch this past weekend at the Bunbury fest here in Cincinnati, and Tom Petty & Co. put on a crisp and entirely charming 60 min. set, mixing songs from both albums, just delightful. Truly one of the highlights of the festival.","classification":4}

{"text":"Weezer's infamous self-titled debut (otherwise known as \"The Blue Album\") is one of the few pieces of music from it's time that still holds up just as well today. When they made their mark in 1994, Kurt Cobain was dead and the music world had already been oversaturated by mumbling, uninspiring grunge clones. Although Weezer never quite changed the musical climate, they did, however, create a quite perfect debut, one that transcends all genres and inspires new bands even today. Few groups that materialized at this time are still around today, but Weezer remain vital, and each song on this ten track debut remains an alternative rock staple. You can't throw a cat in a crowded room without hitting someone who, whether they realize it or not, knows a good Weezer tune. So, it only makes sense that on the tenth anniversary of the release, a Deluxe Edition made it's way with all new artwork and a bonus disc full of b-sides, outtakes, demos, live songs etc. The question is, is it worth buying again?\n\nThe answer? A resounding yes. For starters, I'm sure most owners of this album have put plenty of wear and tear on it, what better time to get yourself another copy. And even if it's still in perfect condition, the bonus material is worth it alone, for the Weezer fanatic. I don't have to tell you how good the original album is. You've heard it, you know. It's perfect, front to back. The material on the second disc, while admittedly not as good as the album itself, is still worthy. Take, for example, Rivers' catchy ode to the presidents of the Weezer fanclub, \"Mykel and Carli\" (who passed away in a tragic car accident), with it's chorus that, in typical Weezer fashion, sticks in your head for the rest of your life. \"Suzanne\" and \"Jamie\" are probably the most well-known b-sides among Weezer fans, while a trio of demos -- referred to as \"The Kitchen Tapes\" -- digs a bit deeper into Weezer history. There are also live songs (\"My Name Is Jonas\" & \"Surf Wax America\") and acoustic versions (\"Jamie\" and \"No One Else\"), and to top it all off, for the diehard fans, the original mix of \"Say It Ain't So\" (which was released only in the early pressings of the Blue Album). Also included is a rather elaborate booklet which includes lyrics (finally) and liner notes that chronicle the early history of Weezer. The package is very well done, and surely outshines the bare-bones nature of the original release.\n\nOverall, a good album just got even better. Despite it's price tag, the average Weezer fan just should not be without this. It might make you love the band even more. You definitely get your money's worth. And as I said before, the original album itself is just classic. Say what you will about Weezer's newer material, but this stuff just can't be beat. They definitely deserve their popularity and their place in modern rock royalty. I really think anyone and everyone can appreciate the Blue Album, an accomplishment a lot of musicians cannot acheive.","classification":5}

{"text":"To get a better glimpse into the artfulness of Jarrod Lawson, please, please, PLEASE!, visit his website by simply typing his name for his web address, ending with dot com. Now, let's get the rather obvious out of the way first: for the brothers, our first thought is, \"This is a white dude getting down like this?!\" The question is nowhere near negative; it is simply astonishing & surprising, superficially at first glance. The 30 second snippets played here on Amazon provide just enough to get you to appreciate while your appetite begins to salivate. My initial thoughts upon hearing these samples were that Jarrod Lawson feels like a combination of the sleekness & pure melodic sweetness of Pete Belasco, with the mellowness & soulfulness of Will Downing with an accent of Take 6; kicked up and licked up to another level so high that it requires you to climb as you can only see the bottom of the journey he is preparing for the juvenescent flight your ears, your mind, your emotions, your sighs, are about to embark upon. This was so very intriguing, so once I learned that his earliest and strongest influences are the late, great Donny Hathaway and the virtuoso that is Stevie Wonder, it made perfect sense why his sound is as such and Jarrod Lawson is such an outstanding compliment to these masters of their craft. I am not writing my opinion: his story explains this; he gives props where props are due. However, it would be a failure and such a biased, incomplete and uniformed statement to say the sum of the matter are only from these two gigantors of music. As the tutelage of his father and emulation of the aforementioned predecessors would naturally provide the backdrop and mindset for excellence, they are not the only materials woven into his enriched fabric that gives & presents to us what we are enjoying right now. His form has taken shape also from the likes of Chopin, jazz artists Chick Corea and Errol Garner, jazz and bass player Pastorius and the \"masterful orchestration\" of French composer Ravel.  But as we all learn while we grow from so many facets in life, the purpose of realizing our own identity ultimately takes hold and a desire for a clear distinction from others; whether it be from family, friends, or the celebrities that perhaps garner our attention, a line in the sand finally takes center stage.  And while this may be an introduction for the majority of us, this is far from being his debut, no doubt about this. And while the cover denotes with questions of the how and the why that J is Law, the very first note begins a 12 track response that ignites and infernos the only answer for us in the end in our \"Oooh\"s & \"Aaahhh\"s of music: \"yeah, J Law, that sounds right to me.\" \"We all have our hills to climb; who's to say if yours is steeper than mine?\" He has consciousness that expresses a mission in the message that is vehicular by music. We all thank you, Jarrod Lawson, for the climb that has brought you to our experience of an auditory exclamation. ~K.I.S.S.E.S.S~ don't lie~","classification":5}

It's everything our parents warned us NOT to do (or fall for).\nIf taken on its surface, it is absolutely objectifying to women, and I can see why some anti-violence activists are crucifying it.  But, if you look at the outrageous actions by both the men AND models in the video, it becomes a lampoon of sexuality and objectification in our society.  Unfortunately, too many in our society ONLY see sexuality and objectification, and this is what creates the dangers of the \"subliminal messages\" in the song which are causing so many to call it a \"rape anthem\".\nListen to it, and decide for yourself if it's an attempt at seduction or just a fun play at it.","classification":5}

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5}

{"text":"This collection of B-Sides is truly necessary to get a completist mindset of the talents and versatility of Amy Winehouse.  Tha album BACK TO BLACK was definitely a concept album about love and relationships and these cuts didn't blend in well or truly fit the concept of what did make the album.  But it in no way means these songs aren't superb and worthy.  Most importantly we have VALERIE which was a huge hit in the UK.  Producer Mark Ronson asked Amy to collaborate with him on it and it appears on his cd but no other Winehouse cd.  A true find.  CUPID is a great soulful version of a classic song.  With MONKEY MAN and HEY LITTLE RICH GIRL Amy has great fun with her band and backup singers to great results.  They are fun, uptempo tracks.  The Cuban styled YOU'RE WONDERING NOW shows yet another side of the versatility Amy possessed.\n\nThe true standouts are the final 2 tracks.  Her rendering of TO KNOW HIM IS TO LOVE HIM will break your heart with its honesty.  And the final demo acoustic version of LOVE IS A LOSING GAME shows Amy's raw and strong talent without the production of a studio.  Instead you get her vocal talent, emotive ability and are left with a strong message of the true talent she possessed.  All these songs are in no way tracks left off for being sub-par but rather songs that just didn't quite fit.  Any Amy Winehouse fan will find them a definite necessity.  Highly recommend.","classification":5}

{"text":"Elva Ruby Connes Miller was truly one of the most amazing voices of the twentieth century. That isn't to say that she has a great voice, or even a good voice, for that matter. What she has is an amazing penchant for an off-key vibrato intensive warbling that makes her second only to Florence Foster Jenkins for most hilarious soprano of the last century. Miller was a fixture in local community theater and amateur productions, and at one point even took her talent to Vietnam to entertain the troops. I am sure they were very entertained. Truly this woman had a heart of gold, even if she had a tongue of lead.\n\nThis compilation is stunning in its breadth. The treatment she gives to these songs cannot even be imagined until heard for oneself. She covers a variety of styles, with a heavy concentration of 1960s sugar-pop like \"Monday, Monday\", \"Let's Hang On\", and \"Yellow Submarine\". (Yes, it's true that Ringo sings substantially better than Mrs. Miller.) Particularly entertaining is the truly dreadful altered lyric masterpiece \"Queen of the House.\" I can't imagine having been a supporting musician or recording technician that had to sit through multiple takes of these masterworks.\n\nListening to this CD is delightfully awful, and I recommend the experience highly to any audiophile who thinks they have heard it all.\n\nRock on, Mrs. Miller!","classification":5}

He lived a full life;but not only that,he lived in one lifetime,more than what five lifetimes would fill. June was alrady gone,sooner than expected,and it must have become a sad part of his life;but he was a man of great Faith,and though nobody ever wants to die and leave all his friends,Johnny was prepared to go to his final reward with his Lord and Master.\n There has already been just about everything possible written about this collection of songs and about all I can think of is how this album affected me. I got a special feeling ,from the first song ,all the way through to the last. The days of \"I Walk The Line\",\"Folsom Prison Blues\",\"Hey Porter\",\"Cry,Cry,Cry\",\"A Boy Named Sue\",\"Jackson\",\"Ballad Of A Teenage Queen\",and the hundreds of other songs we loved Johnny for;were all in the past now.\n It seemed,that for this collection, Johnny simply got out his guitar and sat back and was entertaining himself,after the decades of entertaining us. He sang the songs that meant something to himself,songs that expressed his love of life and living,but more important ,songs expressing his great faith in his God and what awaited him in Heaven.\n This is not an album that Johnny ,or anyone else could have given us years ago;but songs that told of a lifetime of living.\n Thanks,Johnny,for this farewell,and for all the rest of your music and life you shared with us so openly over the yeats;you'll never know how much it has meant to so many people.\n Now ,its time for you and June to Rest In Peace and enjoy your life in Heaven.","classification":5}

I really didn't enjoy the song at all.

{"text":"Alright, Daughtry is definitely not as good as I thought he was. In fact, he might be the most unoriginal guy in modern rock to come around in quite awhile, and that's saying something. However, this time he doesn't sound like another artist, he sounds like his bad self, or more specifically, \"Over You\" which was his previous single. Anybody else see something wrong with this picture? And yet, he rules rock radio.\n\nThe verses are mediocre at best, and the chorus on its short run on radio is already annoying the heck out of me. It just doesn't seem real, like it's a half-hearted effort or something; something to please the record labels. Chris's vocals are stellar as always, but contrary to popular belief, the song itself makes for most of its success, and this one is made, but it's in pieces taped together in a quick effort to please a record executive.\n\nSo overall, on if, if not Daughtry's worse in a rather short career so far. Hopefully he'll come out his sophomore album rather soon, so the rest of the musical skeletons in his compact disc closet will stay where they belong: hidden.","classification":2}

Sadly, her voice really stopped showing on her 4 record on almost all the songs. Her lead-off song from that album Run The World (Girls) doesn't actually ignite a fire, but leaves a flame to be doused over with water. I honestly found the song to be much of a weak anthem. Sadly, I really didn't find the song to actually strike the match in her song. She really was starting to let herself go. It isn't a song that ignites, but feels to be overdrawn and tiring, just as is the case with Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It.) I definitely think she needs to take more time and find a better voice that runs the world that she claims to own.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2}

{"text":"Odessa was the Bee Gees' fourth internationally released album, and their first double album. It was by far their most ambitious release and was had a red-flocked cover and included a poster and sticker. At a certain point the title \"Masterpeace\" was considered.\n\nThe band was still a 5-piece band at the beginning of the recordings, but before the release of the album in 1969, guitarist Vince Melouney had left the group.\n\nThough not a direct concept album there are themes about the ship Odessa that runs though the songs. Apart from some long, mostly instrumental orchestral pieces, the music is not really that different from the group's previous releases.\n\nTo be regarded as a real classic I find the album too uneven, with too many average songs. There are of course a lot songs, too, that ranks with the very best of their early works.  I have always liked their music best without the big arrangements that often burdened good songs too much.\n\nSimple songs with great melodies like, \"Sudddenly\", \"You'll Never See My Face Again\" and \"I Laugh in Your Face\" are still my favourites. I also used to like \"Marley Purt Drive\", but it seems the songs hasn't aged that well.\n\nAmong the classic ballads \"Lamplight\" is outstanding, and \"Melody Fair\" and \"First of May\" are both great songs.\n\nThis 3 CD version contains both mono and stereo versions of the original album, and the third CD contains some very interesting alternate versions along with some previously unreleased songs. Many of these are almost as good as the well-known versions, and a few maybe even better; I especially like the alternate mix of \"You'll Never See My Face Again\". The song \"Barbara Came to Stay\", is the same tune as \"Edison\", with different lyrics, and also one of the great additions. For fans of the group, this deluxe edition of one of their highly praised albums, of course is must.\n\nGreat reproduction of the original cover and a fine informative booklet too.","classification":5}

Think she listened for over an hour, and now it is part of her nighttime ritual, and when I take her brush out and brush her fur while it's playing, she is so content and knows the brushing of her fur means its the final time she will hear it for that day!

I dunno what this band looks like but going out on a limb,  chances are there was a member w a scruffy beard on at one time. For me, music reviews are alittle more flexible. It has time to grow on you, unlike, say, fitting into a pair of pants. It eitheir works or it doesn't. Back to music, it's calming & charming throughout. Pleased w purchase.

{"text":"What do Mice Elf look like? This is a stone groove from Sly and the funky basstastic 'thumpin and pluckin' Larry Graham. Did you know that he is the uncle of rapper Drake? I did not know that. Some classic rhythm guitar from Freddie Stone. Horns and drums, also quite funky and cool. And it goes on and on...\n\nThe lyrics are sung by four band members simultaneously. They sound awesome on the chorus, and in little extraneous moments: 3:03, chen trench strokes, etc? at 3:08, 4:16.\n\nI think this is the song that finally turned Sly Stone away from songs about racial harmony. He didn't think people were getting the message, plus stardom had gotten out of control. He turned further inward and away from the mainstream, took more drugs, and began to write more about more controversial subjects like racism and violence. He name checks his earlier tunes, as if to say 'what was that all about?' He felt like he had sold out and lost the good vibes.","classification":5}

{"text":"There is no question that Michael Jackson was a one-of-a-kind entertainer. While he was extraordinarily popular, he died with a very dear broken heart, and with nothing to show for it, with sever debt and problems where he was plagued with accusations of being a pedophile. While he was found not guilty, he was dearly damaged overall. When he released his final album when he was alive, 2001's Invincible. It not just sold poorly, he accused Sony of racism and poor management, where his album definitely suffered and so did he as a entertainer. His final top 10 song, You Rock My World remains a upbeat and soulful dance hit that has been dearly underrated and overlooked among Jackson's biggest dance songs like Beat It and Dirty Diana. The song brought in a more R&B groove that is driven, with a good sample of Sybil's Don't Make My Over, and showed one final time that Michael was still trying to stand, even though he was looked as a mixed bag. Still, it is a upbeat song worth listening to for die hard fans of the late King Of Pop, and new Michael Jackson fans alike, only whom discovered him because his Michael's death.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","classification":4}

{"text":"I will cut straight to the chase with this review. This album while better than Chicken N Beer is still suspect. The problem with it is that Ludacris is trying too hard to pander to the ladies instead of being that gifted MC we all know he's capable of being. This album sounds like the wack albums that LL Cool J has been recording after The G.O.A.T. Before I get to what makes this album bad I will talk about the good.\n\nHey Ho feat Lil Kim and Lil Fate is not bad. B.O.T.S. Radio feat I.20 and Shawnna is cool too. The Intro fools you because it causes you to believe that this album is going to be hot which you will hear later on is not. My Chick Bad feat the extremely overrated Nicki Minaj and the remix feat Eve, Diamond and Trina might get some rotation. Tell Me A Secret with Ne-Yo gets a pass too. That is where it stops.\n\nThe Bad: How Low is perhaps the most boring club record in recent memory. I don't care how many times the radio tries to beat that song into your subconscious, the track sucks! Equally boring tracks would follow in the form Cant Live With You feat Monica(which is a waste of her talent and your time), Party No Mo feat Gucci Mane and Everybody Drunk feat Lil Scrappy. I Know You Got A Man must be the most painfully bad song for the ladies that I've heard next to Ja Rule's Mesmerized feat Ashanti. I hope I'm not the only one that thinks that Sexting is corny as hell and should have never made it to disc and listen to this cheesy hook while you're at it  \"So I'm just sitting in this rehab class\/ trying to get myself unhooked on a**\/ so then my teacher asked me a question\/ Like Ludacris are you over there sexting\/ Ha ha OMG\/ Lol KIT\/ Smiling faces \/ X and O\/ LMFAO\"(??????!!!!???).\n\nIn short this album is a mess. I know people love Ludacris and thinks he is a tight lyricist but don't use that as an excuse to see past this album's glaring flaws. I love Ludacris and think he's a tight MC too. I thought Theater Of The Mind was an excellent album but Battle Of The Sexes SUCKS! This album sounds like something LL Cool J would make(thats why I gave my review that title). You don't believe me? Listen to Cant Live With You, Sex Room, I Do It All Night, I Know You Got A Man, Feelin So Sexy and Tell Me A Secret and imagine LL Cool J's rhymes about women over those tracks. Now you see what Im talking about.\nthumbs down.\n\nStandouts: B.O.T.S. RADIO, HEY HO, TELL ME A SECRET, MY CHICK BAD(original and remix).","classification":2}

The tunes range in variety from gentle and tranquil to epic and grandiose, and Spaeth's mastery of the keyboard enables him to command different styles and techniques to elicit those diverse moods.\n\nThe album also features Tina Guo on cello and Christopher Luther on violin.\n\nThis is a fine and worthy entry in the solo piano genre.","classification":5}

{"text":"Although I'm a big fan of Chopin's piano music, I hesitated over buying this collection at $5.99 for months before finally deciding to go for it. The reason for the hesitation is that, while I like many of the fine pianists who contributed their performances to this edition, I already own a pretty comprehensive Chopin's collection--usually in multiple versions by the likes of big names such as Rubinstein, Horowitz, Argerich, Ashkenazy, Arrau, Richter, etc. So why buy more versions by very good but somewhat lesser names?\nHowever, I finally decided to go for it and just as I was pressing the \"buy\" button I realized that the price had dropped from $5.99 to 99 cents. As you can imagine, I pressed that button all harder so that the price wouldn't disappear before my eyes.\nAnd I'm glad I did. These are very fine accounts of Chopin's core repetoire. Everything you'd expect to find is here except for the complete Mazurkas--of them we get only a handful. I've now listened to most of the set and everything is very good, with Abbey Simon playing the bulk of the collection. OK, he's not quite at the Rubinstein level (especially in the Nocturnes)--but who is?--and his accounts are very graceful and enjoyable. Of Simon's work, so far I most like the Etudes--played with delicacy and poetry rather than fiery virtuosity. I also like Simon's first Concerto (I haven't yet heard the second, which is next on my list). Klein's preludes are very good. I also particularly like Johanessen's Polonaises, played with lyricism and authority. He's a pianist I had not heard before, and I'm very glad to make his acquaintance.\nSo there's a lot for the veteran Chopinist to appreciate, and it's nice to have his major body of work in a single collection.\nMoreover, if you're new to classical music or you don't yet have a comprehensive Chopin collection, this is truly a must-buy, particularly at the present low, low price.","classification":5}

{"text":"Lorne Balfe had quite a task ahead of him when he was brought on late to score Paramounts attempt of breathing life into one of the most iconic action franchises in film. It seems the Terminator franchise hasn't been able to match the level of Camerons T2: Judgement Day. Also despite Marco Beltramis and Danny Elfmans best efforts, those scores never felt part of the legacy that Brad Fiedel left. Balfe was a perfect fit here because his style and sound fit so seamlessly. With Hans Zimmer serving as Executive Music Producer and doing some synth programming, we get that old school synth sound from the 90s that Fiedel made iconic with his T1 and T2 scores. Balfes score embraces what came before it by keeping 1 leg in the past and 1 leg in the future, therefore creating a score that successfully bridges a gap all the while being supremely entertaining.\n\nGenisys sort of acts as a direct sequel to T2 and does a great job of making the whole time-traveling narrative work. The score from Balfe is bold and shimmery while being rhythmically driven, which gives us some awesome builds. The shimmering synth makes it feel like part of the Terminator sound, while Balfes writing style bursts through to make it feel new and uniquely his own. The Fate and Hope 3-note motif becomes the central heart of the score that speaks to the character triangle of Sarah, Kyle and the T-800 affectionately called Pops by Sarah in the film. This 3-note theme works surprisingly very well, especially to create the emotional bond between the T-800 and Sarah Connor. Similar to how John Connor bonded with the T-800 in T2. The action is fueled by a percussive march that Lorne uses to create some wonderful builds and add intensity. Balfe does a great job of referencing the Fiedel themes just the right amount, while saving the full reprise for the end credits. While the film itself suffers from a generic PG-13 studio glaze, it still ends up being a pretty solid entertainer due to Balfes fantastic soundscape.\n\nBalfes Terminator: Genisys is wonderfully structured, has that vintage synth sound that calls back to T2, is uniquely Balfe in its writing and surprises us with pockets of emotion. Genisys is a real entertainer, from a solid 3-note central motif to anchor it and a percussive march that propels the narrative forward and gives rigid structure to the action. In the end you can stand back and admire Lornes range from a huge action tentpole like this down to his more intimate documentary scores. The film definitely is a more engaging ride because of the music here, and the score stands very well on its own as well.","classification":4}

Instead, so many artists like Fifth Harmony and One Direction, have really missed the mark on talent, and let the music dearly slide as a result. For newcomers whom came out a few years ago like Meghan Trainor, I haven't been too fond of the songs that came out either. Meghan has had a few songs that have been more mixed like Dear Future Husband to name as a example. However, when I heard her latest song, I honestly was surprised because it honestly is a joyous diddy overall. Better When I'm Dancin', Meghan's single from The Peanuts Movie, is actually a song that I can sincerely enjoy overall. It is a delightful song that feel delightful and something that is honestly better than most of the jokes on radio today.

{"text":"Ambrosia \"is an American rock band formed in southern California in 1970. Ambrosia had five Top Forty hit singles between 1975 and 1980. The \"founding members included guitarist\/vocalist David Pack, bassist\/vocalist Joe Puerta, keyboardist Christopher North, and drummer Burleigh Drummond, fused symphonic art rock with a slickly produced pop sound. The group was discovered in 1971 by Los Angeles Philharmonic conductor Zubin Mehta, who featured Ambrosia as part of a so-called All-American Dream Concert. However, it took them four more years to get a record contract; Ambrosia was released in 1975 and spawned the chart singles `Holdin' on to Yesterday' and `Nice, Nice, Very Nice.'\"\n\nThese five tracks by Ambrosia give us just some of their best; this is great for casual fans and people just discovering their beautiful music. \"Biggest Part of Me\" was a big hit and it still gets airplay in our times; Ambrosia performs this with a lot of genuine passion and the music fits in perfectly with their vocals--great! \"How Much I Feel\" was another hit for the group and just one listen tells you why; this is a charming tune. \"Holdin' on to Yesterday\" is yet another awesome song by this band and it all holds its own very well. \"Nice, Nice, Very Nice\" is easy on the ear and the track set ends with Ambrosia performing their fine \"You're The Only Woman (You & I).\" Now THIS is great music!\n\nAmbrosia fans should download any tracks here that they don't have already; but as I wrote above this is best geared toward casual fans and newcomers to their artistry. I highly recommend the singularly beautiful music of Ambrosia.","classification":5}

{"text":"Monica is one of my personal favorite R&B singers (hard choice whether \"The First Night\" or \"For You I Will\" is my favorite!); vocally, her voice is pure and has a nice timbre (sound) to it.  For me, it was disappointing to see that 2006's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Makings-of-Me\/dp\/B000HA4WES\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Makings of Me<\/a>&nbsp;failed to captivate the charts, debuting at #8 with under 100,000 copies.  The album went on to flop by Monica standards, failing to go gold (2003's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/After-the-Storm\/dp\/B00006BSW3\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">After the Storm<\/a>&nbsp;went platinum and bowed at #1.  2010's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Still-Standing\/dp\/B002LVGU78\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Still Standing<\/a>&nbsp;arrives much more anticipated than THE MAKINGS OF ME and is lifted by exceptional lead single \"Everything To Me.\"  Sure, \"Everytime Tha Beat Drop\" was a solid club cut from Mo's last album, but it wasn't truly distinctive enough to build sufficient buzz.  And by the time the best cut \"A Dozen Roses (You Remind Me)\" was released as a single, there wasn't enough commercial support to save The Makings of  Me.  Perhaps that's the reason Still Standing seems a bit more conservative and mature in conception than other Monica albums.  It is not necessarily better than any other Monica album, but the more adult-contemporary approach seems to flow better than Monica attempting to \"take it to the clubs.\"  The result is a solid, if somewhat safe album, though most important, Monica's voice is as pure if not more purer than ever.\n\nThe album opens with my favorite cut, the understated, yet overt \"Still Standing\" featuring Ludacris.  Ludacris's verse is fine here, though Monica holds down the track very well with or without the Dirty South MC.  The production is contemporary, though it even appeals to more \"grown\" listeners, which is one thing I personally think is clever about this album.  Unfortunate that \"Still Standing\" couldn't have been a great hit single as I personally think it is stronger than just being a \"buzz single\" or the theme from Monica's BET show. With some great lyrics (\"I'm letting go, I'm letting God... etc.), it is a dynamite opening cut.  \"One In A Lifetime\" isn't quite as prolific as \"Still Standing\" but it is catchy enough and most definitely another solid cut from this affair.  As always, Monica sings her face off in her own cool, connected and conservative vein.  \"Stay or Go,\" the third track is simply beautiful.  Stripped down, rather conservative production in a time of \"overt production\" in urban music (save for rhythmic drums) makes this track truly noteworthy.  Most importantly, \"Stay Or Go\" showcases the most beautiful, nuanced portions of Monica's voice.  She never over-sings, and while some may criticize she is not flashy enough, I believe that her reserved vocal performances at times make her more appealing vocally.\n\n\"Everything To Me\" is a clear valedictory cut.  Most brilliant might have been choosing this #1 R&B hit as the first notable single from the album.  The reason this song has been a success in my mind is because it hearkens back to the golden age of R&B.  The problem with a lot of urban music today is that we've become too caught up in electronics and programming.  The reason why a song like \"Everything To Me\" performs so well and stands out is because it is not inline with contemporary R&B, but rather more traditional R&B.  Take \"Pretty Wings\" by Maxwell or even \"Un-Thinkable (I'm Ready)\" by Alicia Keys - they resonate because they are a break from everything else on urban radio.  \"Everything to Me\" is nearly the perfect cut on any album in my mind.\n\n\"If You Were My Man\" finds Monica teaming up with Missy Elliott (where is Missy by the way) in an \"80's\" inspired dance-cut.  Smartly, \"If You Were My Man\" doesn't settle for a hip-hop driven production but draws from past inspiration and seeks for a more adult contemporary touch.  Not my favorite cut, but it works.  \"Mirror\" finds Monica conceding to some hip-hop ideals, but who faults for one track?  The production might be just the slightest bit too overt\/too loud as during the verse it slightly covers up Mo's vocals.  Despite this, the songwriting is well done and Monica provides yet another captivating performance.  This cut would've been perfect on Toni Braxton's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Pulse\/dp\/B002VZC9I8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pulse<\/a>, maybe stripped down a little more.  It sort of reminds me of \"Yesterday\" from that album in concept.  The end vocals by Monica are quite dynamic by all means.\n\n\"Here I Am\"  is another standout. Dusty, but big drums help provide a nice supportive canvas for Monica to paint her alto-ish vocals.  More soulful production has boded best for Monica for years (\"The First Night\", \"So Gone\", \"A Dozen Roses {You Remind Me]\").  This instance is no exception.  \"Superman\" sounds like 1990's, early 00's R&B before the southern rap invasion. It is by no means a pathway that hasn't already been treaded, but isn't it nice to hear organs, horns, and soulful guitar? I think so.\n\nPenultimate track \"Love All Over Me\" continues the more adult-contemporary vein of R&B, which best suits Mo. It allows her voice to shine, particularly with well mixed background vocals that never overshadow Monica's lead vocals.  Maybe it is a little melodramatic, but I definitely feel Mo's passion and connect with her delivery. Closing track \"Believing in Me\" is a fine inspiration closure to the album.\n\nNo, Still Standing is by no means \"the second coming,\" but it is a solid comeback album for Monica and one of 2010's best\/most solid R&B albums. It is never overproduced like so many contemporary R&B albums and Monica sings just the right amount of notes when ad libbing for my fancy.  I hope that the Recording Academy remembers this album when it come times for nominating Best Contemporary R&B album and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance.  4 stars.","classification":4}

{"text":"Scene: Brought to mind by one of the snapshot photos that grace each CD in this series. Doc's Drugstore and Soda Foundation (not shown), located in the heart of the North Adamsville shopping streets, and most importantly, just a few minutes walk from North Adamsville High School. The soda fountain counter area is complete with a dozen single stools, a speckled faux-marble formica countertop with assorted pastry trays, candy boxes, pie cabinets and various condiment combinations for Doc's `greasy spoon\" hamburgers and hot dogs. Said single stools are strictly for losers, girl friend-less guys (or once in a great while a girl just trying catch a quick soda on the way home) or old people waiting for Doc to fill their ancient medicines prescriptions. They are no factor, no factor at all in this teen-worthy world. No, less than no factor. Every once in a while, however, one of Fritz Cullen's corner boys takes his foot off the wall in front of Doc's and enters to get a take out Cherry Coke, the de riguer drink of Fritz's boyos.\n\nBut the fountain is strictly for food and drink, food and drink that is also strictly secondary to why Doc's is a teen-worthy heaven. The real draw is the quiet booths that line both corner walls and are only for after school boy-girl couples, four-some girls looking for guys to dance with, and at night, mainly school year weekend and summer every nights, Fritz's Cullen's corner boys when they tire of holding up Doc's wall out front (or more realistically when the hour is late and the girl prospects have dimmed). But the booths mean nothing by themselves except as \"resting\" areas after some fast dance coming from Doc's super-charged juke box, complete with the very latest records straight from Pete' Platters Record Shop so you know the are hot.\n\nRight now, just this very teen ear minute, one can hear the sassy sound of The Drifters This Magic Moment in the background as we fix on a boy and girl taking a break from deep conversation (deep conversation related in teen world to either sex, setting up dates, analyzing the state of their eternal relationship, or some combination of all three) and taking a straw sip from their shared Cherry Coke. The Cherry Coke automatically means that rank and file Doc's corner boy Harry \"Red\" Radley is present on one of the straws. On the other Donna Blanchard, one of the hottest sixteen year old sophomore girls at North Adamsville High, with a nice shape, a sweet smile, and a \"come hither\" look that has had more than one boy moony-eyed for her affections. But no dice, no dice at all. In this autumn of the year of our lord nineteen hundred and sixty Miss Donna Blanchard only has eyes, and whatever else she has to give, for one Red Radley. Let's listen in as the eminently forgettable Booby Vee is droning on in the background about some lost love (and rightfully so, if the truth be known) on Take Good Care Of My Baby.\n*********\n\n\"What the matter, honey, don't you want me like that, \" murmered Donna Blanchard after being told for the fifth or sixth time by our corner boy Red Radley that, if you can believe this, no he was not ready for heavy sex (meaning of course, in the language of the young, some variety of \"going all the way\"). It seems that last Saturday night down at Adamsville Beach, the local \"parking\" heaven where one and all went to see the \"submarine races\" in the local teen code parlance Donna, making no bones that she was ready, more than ready, to go all the way with Red got turned down. Turned down flat. Fortunately for Red Donna, embarrassed by such a fool for a boy friend, had \"neglected\" to mention this hard fact of life when the obligatory Monday morning Girls' \"Lav\" talk got around to the subject of the weekend scorecard. In short, who did, and didn't do it. Right now Red and Donna are trying to sort things out as a strangely ironic song by Cathy Jean and the Roommates, Please Love Me Forever, spins on the juke box.\n\nWhat? A member in good standing of Fritz Cullen's corner boys, corner boys who have, publicly anyway, notched up (went all they way with) more North Adamsville girls than maybe there were girls in North Adamsville turned down a chance at paradise. And turned down a certified fox like Donna Blanchard. No way. Moreover, Red, displaying he not uncommon teen male bravado had lied to his fellow corner boys and said that he had had already \"gone all the way\" with Donna. Jesus. Did our Red have a medical problem? No. Did he have some religious scruples about pre-martial sex? Hell, no. Our Red, as it turns out was a virgin and was terrified when Donna, a virgin herself but ready for the time of her time, came on so strong. Especially when she went wild on Saturday night when the local 24\/7 rock and roll station, WMEX, played a medley of Elvis tunes including his latest, Surrender.\n\nSome times things end right in the teen universe, sometimes they don't. This time they didn't. Well, at least for Red. After their little conversation at Doc's Red and Donna agreed, but mostly Donna agreed, that they should see other people. That's teen code, and maybe universal code, for \"breaking up.\" So now one sees the fetching Donna Blanchard riding around in Jimmy Jakes '59 cherry Chevy, and sitting very close indeed. Moreover she has that look, that certain look like she now knows a thing or two about ways of the world. Well, after all it was the time of her time, wasn't it? As for Red, well, Red is seen more and more occupying one of those single stools at Doc's counter sipping a Cherry Coke and endlessly throwing nickels, dimes and quarters in the juke box playing Elvis' It's Now or Never. Enough said.","classification":4}

While that effort shows promise, its slight disarray is sometimes jarring.\n\nNow forward to 2006, the golden boy of music returns with first single Sexyback off FutureSex\/LoveSounds. The single is an incredible piece of sweet funk, combining the sensuality of yesteryear's Prince and the deft execution of pre-scandal Michael jackson. With a hot salacious video to boot, the song is sure pop ecstasy.\n\nAt the helm of things is once again hip master Timbaland whose collaborations always bear edible fruits. Remixes of the song range from mediocre to superb, beginning with the lackadaisical Pokerface Club Mix which sounds like a piece of early 90's recycled house mix.  The slightly more varied Linus Loves Remix ups the ante with a more danceable electro beat. The best mix has to be the cool Tom Novy Ibiza Mix that cleverly uses a verse of Timberlake's sung vocals wrapped around some hypnotic and lackbaid grooves.","classification":4}

{"text":"It's obvious I don't have to say that Nirvana literally changed rock music in the 90's, because EVERYONE knows that did. GO ahead and dislike them if you like, but these three men created a fresh, bold new sound back in 1991. Nevermind and In Utero are the albums that put alternative rock into the mainsteam (thus we now have Grunge, Alternative Metal, Post-Grunge, etc.). Sure, I like Korn and Staind and such, but I always know that Nirvana is the one that gave them a bit of influence, at least.\n\nHere in Nevermind, it's all so engaging. Everyone knows \"Smells like Teen Spirit\" and that it's an excellent (but maybe overrated) song, so I'm not going into detail here. \"Lithium\" and \"In Bloom\" are two of my favorites: both have that energetic and lyrical feel that's found in many later singles in the 90's. \"Come as You Are\" is as haunting as \"Heart Shaped Box\" in In Utero. \"Polly\" is an acoustic song that dwelves away from the hard-rocking energy that's constant throughout the album. \"Territorial Pissings\" is so intense that I worry that my neighbors would complain when I play it in a loud volume. Finally, \"Something in the Way\" is a stunning conclusion to the album: soft, eerie, melodic, and beautiful at the same time.\n\nPersonally, my favorite song from Nirvana is \"Heart Shaped Box\" from \"In Utero\", but the songs here will always be memorable not only to me, but to a vast majority of the human race.\n\nGrade: A","classification":5}

{"text":"Glad by Traffic is may be the best rock instrumental ever. It is my most favorite track among their many great songs. It also stands up to the passage of time very well.. This remix sounds a bit brighter that I recall but that may be some electronic wizardry reducing or eliminating the hiss, hum and noise inherent in the analog audio technology of that time. It retains the original feel for me and I think this remix is a success (and not all are!).\n\nComing of age and playing guitar in a local rock band in the late 60's through early 70's made Traffic's music an important part of my soundtrack for those days. No question I'm predisposed to love this music and it  brings back memories and feelings from some of the best times of my life.\n\nBecause it's such a great song with a successful remastering, brings back good feelings from my youth and it holds up so well over decades I'm giving Glad a solid 5 stars. I think is one of several great intros to Traffic for someone unfamiliar with the band.","classification":5}

{"text":"...and the quality of Queensryche's music has done just that.\nPromised Land is a strange album for Queensryche to release, mostly because they had just enjoyed mainstream success with the likes of Empire. In contrast, Promised Land is much darker, more brooding and certainly less mainstream (arguably the least mainstream album the band have ever released). And that's a good thing right? Well, not necessarily.\nThe fact that this is boring. Just because it is dark does not make it really intelligent. I respect the fact that they did what they wanted rather than lap up the commercial success like Metallica did at the same time. But that doesn't mean that everything they do is automatically brilliant because of it.\nThe fact is that this has hardly any decent songs to mention. It lacks the energy of Warning and Queensryche EP, the accessiblity of Empire and the brilliance of Operation Mindcrime. It does have the wierdness of Rage For Order but in a bad way since it is resorts to uninspired sluggishness rather than the sinister almost industrial feel of Rage For Order.\nFor an album that took 2 years to write and record, Queensryche don't have a lot to show for it. It seems like they were going out of their way to be different rather than just letting the music flow.","classification":3}

I forgot how much warmth and wisdom Billy Joels voice contains.  Barbra sounds great singing with the piano man.  Barbra harmonizes so well with John Legend on the song What Kind of Fool.  I absolutely love the original with Barry Gibb, but John gives this song a new soulful quality.  The piano and acoustic guitar playing are so pretty on the song Evergreen.  Babyface sounds so smooth and soulful on this classic song.\n\nId Want It to Be You is a beautiful duet with Blake Shelton.  This song makes me believe that Blake and Barbra could be the best of friends  I have never heard of this song before, and it is a pleasant surprise.  I love Barbras duet with Stevie Wonder entitled People. I love Stevies harmonica playing on this track.  His vocals are superb too.  It is great to hear him sing anything after such a long absence.  Only Streisand could get all my favorite singers to perform on her album.  Come Rain or Come Shine features John Mayer playing a bluesy electric guitar.  This song sounds so cool because of John Mayers talents.  The biggest surprise may be Barbras duet with her son Jason Gould on the song How Deep is the Ocean.  This is a very touching and beautiful song.  I cant stop listening to this CD.  It is one of the best of the year.","classification":5}

{"text":"Perhaps four stars, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.\n1976 was a getting-back-on-the-bus year for the Dead, what with having been on a little hiatus, and one can hear that they haven't quite reached that '77 sound and some concerts, in retrospect, seem like a warm-up for the year ahead (though they still stamped another unique year of style to their history, and for some Heads I know, '76 is their fave.) They still played some great shows, of course, but not many are represented on official releases, although, Dick's Picks 33 is a very strong couple of shows from that year.\nAs a Grateful Dead fan will appreciate, you often have to accept the juxtaposition of the sloppy with the sublime in some concert instances, and there are definitely some rusty clunks here, but plenty of great moments, including a unique and groovy St. Stephen jam; one of the best versions of Crazy Fingers that I've heard and a general shine throughout that makes this worth the purchase for it's unique sound and because there aren't heaps of official '76 recordings available.\nOh, and a rare 'Mission in the Rain' on the filler part of disc three.","classification":5}

Re-release these as singles, and  they will be hits in the folk-music circles, and could hold their own on  some more popular stations (like Chicago's WXRT).\n\nFor me, I loved Studs  Terkel reading \"Blessed Be the Nation,\" Jackson Browne\/Bonnie  Raitt singing, \"Kisses Sweeter than Wine,\" and the deeply  haunting \"My Father's Mansion\" as sung by Billy Bragg and Eliza  Carthy in a celtic flavor.\n\nHearing Donovan's version of \"My Rainbow  Race\" was refreshing, and Dick Gaughan's dramatic rendering of  \"Waist Deep in the Big Muddy\" knocked my socks off. Surprising me  was Tim Robbins' \"All My Children of the Sun.\" So he can sing,  too? Amazing.\n\nListen to Greg Brown singing \"Sailing Down My Golden  River.\" He has a Johnny Cash thing going on when he sings it, don't  you think? Check it out. Very cool.\n\nThere are others, some 39 songs in  all, and each I honestly liked.

{"text":"This is a soft and beautiful country song, with a great perspective on aging gracefully.\n\nHaving said that, I believe that Ashley Monroe is musically gifted.  However, after listening to this song, I felt like something was just missing.  So I listened to it a few more times, just to be sure my impression didn't change.  In my opinion, what is missing from the song is the emotional impact it could (should?) have had.\n\nHer vocals have a bit of a nasal quality, which is not automatically a negative.  However, I think the song would have been more pleasant, and she could have conveyed more emotion, if she had more fully used her diaphragm to support her voice.  This would have allowed her to match the timbre of the music to the wisdom of the lyrics.  In other words, the song sounded like she was singing AT the microphone, rather than singing from a place deep within the core of herself.  And great artistic creations, as well as emotions, come from deep within a person.\n\nIt's nice to have the opportunity to listen to new artists through these promotions, and I'm glad I picked this one up while it is free, because I wouldn't have listened to her otherwise.  Ms. Monroe has potential, and it will be interesting to watch her voice and career develop.","classification":4}

{"text":"I have a story about the first time I heard Roundabout. I was seven years old, and I was at church camp in the summer of 1974. I slept on a top bunk in a green cabin. Previous occupants had written weird stuff on the ceiling. Anyhow, I didn't like being at camp too much, but there were these hippie junior ministers who played acoustic guitars and had us sing hippie religious songs, like I am the resurrection, and tunes from Godspell. They were pretty cool. They also had a Chevy van with these big speakers that weren't locked down to anything. So, one night we were going somewhere and I got to ride in the van. I got in it and someone put one of the speakers in my lap and said I had to hold onto it. They turned on the stereo and I soon felt an amazing vibration surge through my hands and into my brain and I had no idea what was going on...but it was like some kind of epiphany. I didn't know it was Roundabout at the time. But I recognized it when I eventually heard it again, and I knew it was Chris Squire's Rickenbacker bass that had affected me so much.\n\nThat bass comes in at 0:45. It has this woody, round texture, almost like a thick cord of elastic rope, this is what it feels like to me. Rick Wakeman's keyboard riff at 1:53 is pretty dramatic as well. We had a pipe organ at my church, so I probably thought this was another hippie religious song.\n\nMountains come out of the sky and they stand there...they just stand there, doing what mountains do.","classification":5}

{"text":"I absoulutly love this cd. Here is a rundown of the songs.\nCAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME-BEST OPENER EVER.Not just by Iron Maiden. This song is truly great. IT is never mentioned as Maiden's best song, but I do believe it should be mentioned up there with \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" and \"Hallowed be thy name\". Those two songs,this song,\"The Prisoner\", and a song to come up later on this cd are my 5 favorite Maiden songs as of now.\nWASTED YEARS-Cool opening riff, that is also in other parts of the song. The lyrics in this song are pretty inspirational. The song itself is pretty good and inspirational too.\nSEA OF MADNESS-This is probably Maiden's loudest track ever. It is a heck of a song also. The lyrics are good and the instruments are all working well in this song.\nHEAVEN CAN WAIT-ONE OF MY FAVORITE MAIDEN SONGS!It is tied with \"Caught somewhere in Time\" for my favorite song on this disc. IT has the best lyrics on the cd. It is like an awesome 7-minute musical rollercoaster ride. AMAZING!\nTHE LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE RUNNER-Wow,long title for this song. Despite the not so good lyrics in this song it is still excellent.\nSTRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND-This is a good track. Great lyrics and great everything in another one of my favorites.\nDEJA-VU-This is the song that I don't listen to alot on this cd. It\n isn't bad, it just isn't as good as the other songs on the disc.\nALEXANDER THE GREAT-This is a pretty good epic to end the cd. Some people say they were going for another \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\".I think that they were trying for something different. It is a GREAT song.","classification":5}

Confound it, get this song immediately!!","classification":5}

{"text":"A number of great rock talents emerged during late 80s and early 90s but almost all of them were short-lived. Some still went ahead but with little commercial support. Steelheart is one of such bands that were swayed by rise and fall of US metal market during 90s. The case of Steelheart was much more tragic; the vocalist Mike Matijevic got seriously injured during the tour in 1992 and the history of the band ended with the accident. Four years later Mike relaunched the band with totally different line-up and the third Steelheart album \"Wait\" was released in 1996. The band reunited again in 2006 and is still active.\n\nThe second album released in 1992 is on the whole heavier and tighter than the debut. They might never have liked the way the band had been remembered; the band which was known by ballad hits such as SHE'S GONE, and I'LL NEVER LET YOU GO. True that this album also has excellent ballads such as ALL YOUR LOVE, and MAMA DON'T YOU CRY but what caught attention of Japanese metal fans most was its eighth track STEELHEART, excellent speed metal track showcasing Mike's wild vocal appeal. \"Steelheart\" got extensive air play in Japan. I also like party anthem tracks such as LATE FOR THE PARTY and LOVE'EM AND I'M COME. I still prefer their debut album for its overall song quality but I love their second one a lot.\n\nVerdict: Another home run that didn't get appreciation they deserve.\nRating: 90 out of 100\nRecommended for: Heavy metal fans who also love GN'R, Motley Crue, Van Halen, TNT, and Scorpions. Essential for Steelheart fans.","classification":5}

{"text":"To me, this is one of the greatest songs of all times.  Just the thought of meeting Jesus in Heaven and wondering what I would do is such an uplifting tenant for a song.  Plus there is something about the quality  of the voice of the lead singer that is so sincere, it leaves no doubt that one day, many will be meeting Jesus and wondering, \"Should I dance for You, Jesus, or in Awe of You, Be Still?\"\n\nThe song is so tender and gentle and at the same time, so powerful, that I recommend listening to it as a wonderful contemplation of the reality of being with Jesus some day.  I know it will affect you greatly in a most positive and touching way. It brings hope, joy, and tears.","classification":5}

The Greatest Hits CD is a nifty sampler, but for a  few bucks more you get great liner notes and a deeper song selection.  Mott's place in the music history books is not always recognized.  Critics  loved them, so you can't call them underrated.  So,  I call them the most  overlooked band of the 70's.  This 2 CD set is a chance for you to catch  up.

{"text":"The title song from the soundtrack, written and recorded by the star of the film. It doesn't get more Jimmy Cliff than this. A watershed moment in Jamaican film and reggae music, the film is a cult classic and so is the album. The music is fairly straightforward, it bops along to Jimmy's manifesto to himself: life is short and he is going to go out there and get what he wants, no matter what. He sings that he would 'rather be a free man in my grave than living as a puppet or a slave.' I seem to recall a discussion among friends about this universal concept; as long as one has hope, then one must continue to survive, even as a slave. But everyone has a breaking point, when you can't take it anymore and you are willing to die in order to be free. What do you think?","classification":5}

{"text":"Now, before you press that \"not helpful\" button simply because I gave this album two stars, hear me out. I am a lifelong Yes fan, and they are my all-time favorite band (Dylan is my all-time favorite artist, Yes is my favorite band). I love these guys, and I have all of their albums. I saw this incarnation of Yes at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia last year (with Oliver Wakeman) and hung out with all of them backstage for quite awhile. I've always loved these guys, and I loved every album this band has released (including 1980's 'Drama,' 1987's 'Big Generator,' 1991's 'Union' and 1997's 'Open Your Eyes').\n\nUntil this one.\n\nLook, I'm going to come out and say it, 'Fly from Here' blows. Yes, the Roger Dean cover art is great, and the funky Yes logo design is quite nice, but the music just isn't what it once was. The playing is alright, but it is not what it should be for musicians on this level. Benoit David is an okay singer, but I've come to the conclusion that he simply does impersonations on stage. He sounded alright the night I saw him, but he's either impersonating Jon Anderson or he's impersonating Trevor Horn (as he does here). Don't get me wrong, he's talented, and he's a nice guy too, but he just doesn't have much personality as a vocalist. That, for me, is a problem.\n\nAnd then there is the production. Trevor Horn, in my opinion, is one of the best producers of the modern era. His work on '90125,' ABC's 'The Lexicon of Love,' and the Art of Noise records are just phenomenal. The guy is simply a genius as a producer. But on 'Fly from Here,' the production sounds very stale and quite amateurish, like he is using a GarageBand like computer program instead of proper production techniques. Considering all of the wonderfully produced records being made in this day in age (like Radiohead's 'The King of Limbs'), there is absolutely no excuse for a band like Yes to have an album this poorly produced, ESPECIALLY coming from a first-rate producer like Trevor Horn.\n\nThe songs are also somewhat of a disappointment. A previous reviewer described this really as a Buggles album, with Benoit David singing and Steve, Chris, and Alan playing along and occasionally throwing something in. To some extent, that is true. Steve Howe does get a solo piece here which is quite nice (I personally prefer 'Masquerade' from 1991's 'Union,' but that's just me), but the rest of it just doesn't seem to fit Yes very well. 'We Can Fly from Here' is a track that has been floating around since 1980, and it was even performed on the 'Drama' tour (a live version of it recorded at Madison Square Garden in New York in September of that year was released on the 2005 'The Word is Live' box set). Really, extending the track into a 22-minute suite just wasn't smart. The track worked brilliantly as a 6-minute tune, and if it were recorded on this album as it was performed on the 'Drama' tour, perhaps I wouldn't object to it. But trying to stretch it out into a lengthy epic suite like 'The Gates of Delirium' and 'Ritual' (and shortening it's title to 'Fly from Here') is just ridiculous. 'Life on a Film Set' could easily have appeared on the Buggles' 1979 album 'The Age of Plastic,' and 'The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be' is somewhat sappy, surprising coming from Squire. His voice doesn't sound bad, but the lyrics just aren't good.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I do like the Buggles. But if I buy a Yes record, I want to hear Yes. I don't want to hear the Buggles. That why I bought 'The Age of Plastic.'\n\nThe final complaint I have is that Geoff Downes just doesn't click with Yes anymore. He is an ideal fit in Asia, with Wetton, Howe and Palmer, but in the 2011-present version of Yes, he just doesn't blend. He was right for Yes in the early '80s, but for some reason, he just doesn't seem to be on the same page as the rest of the band nowadays. He is a stellar keyboardist (one of the best), but he just seems out of place in the new Yes.\n\nLook, I'm all for Yes trying new things, but this album just doesn't work. It isn't well produced, it's not well written, and in 20 years, when one is making a list of what they would consider classic Yes songs, let's be honest, NONE of these songs would even be contenders. This album is the first time I have ever felt disappointment from my favorite band, and I hope it is the only time. If this were some other band, maybe this record wouldn't bother me. But I was expecting so much better from musicians like Yes.\n\nI recommend the album 'The Living Tree,' by Jon Anderson & Rick Wakeman, which is also new for 2011. While that record is far more stripped down, it is well produced, it is far more intimate, and it is also better performed. That is the record Yes fans should be buying. 'Fly from Here' isn't. Buy 'The Living Tree' before 'Fly from Here.'\n\nOverall, this record was such a letdown to me. Like I have said, it is the only Yes album that has left a sour taste in my mouth. I hate to jump on the bandwagon (especially because I am such a fan of the 'Drama' album), but this group needs Jon Anderson back desperately. Peter Frampton also played the night I saw Yes, and he definitely outperformed them that night. But that's irrelevant. The new record just isn't what it should be. I had such high expectations for this band's first album in 10 years. This album was well below my expectations.\n\nI know I'm going to get a lot of unhelpful votes for this, but honestly, stick with the Yes albums you already have. If you don't own 'Fly from Here,' take my word for it: you aren't missing much.","classification":2}

{"text":"These are soaring, inspiring, and sometimes stunning performances by 12 year old classical crossover artist Jackie Evancho, who possesses a mature, crystal clear, angelic voice that once again is captured within ideal musical frameworks played by full orchestra with strings. Possessing a voice that can go from a whisper to solid upper register notes surfing above the crest of a huge orchestra reaching its crescendo, Ms Evancho's upper altissimo notes may literally make your hair stand on end. Following her successes on \"America's Got Talent\", national tours, a record-setting PBS appearance, and 3 critically-acclaimed and platinum-selling recordings featuring songs from classical, folk, movie soundtrack, religious, and popular music genres, she collaborates here with Grammy-winning producer\/engineer Humberto Gatica and renowned musical director\/arranger Bill Ross. She performs 12 wonderful recordings from movies such as Moulin Rouge, South Pacific, Mulan, Tangled, The Lion King, The Phantom of the Opera, and Titanic. Guest artists are Joshua Bell, Chris Botti, The Canadian Tenors, 2Cellos, and her older brother Jacob Evancho. Each selection is excellent but the 'best of the best' includes a fabulous version of \"The Music of The Night\" that is as good as I have heard. \"Can You Feel The Love\" is marvelous and her version of \"Reflection\" from Mulan is possibly the definitive performance. The heightened drama of \"The Summer Knows\" is accentuated perfectly by Botti's trumpet. There are stirring versions of \"Se\" featuring the group 2Cellos, \"My Heart Will Go On\" with violin star Joshua Bell, and ascendant version of \"Come What May\" with the Canadian Tenors, and a rapturous, heavenly version of \"When I Fall In Love\" that may bring on goosebumps at the end. Young Ms Evancho's career is advancing at a measured pace, revealing more musical wonders as it goes forward and this recording is quite an achievement. My Highest Recommendation. Five BRILLIANT Stars! (12 tracks, Time-60 minutes:17 seconds","classification":5}
{"text":"It seems easy for people to critisize jewel for making such a big step when she seems to be on the right track with emotional ballads and sweet acoustic songs. Then why change? In my opinion a tallented musician should be able to combine different types of musical sounds, and be able to make a change in direction and still be in best form. To me jewel has done just that with this sassy peice of kwirky sophisticated pop. Each song on the album is a highlight with many different sounds. Intuition was the lead single with its accordian mixed with gentle pop\/r&b beats, there are signs of soft rock material with \"2 become 1\" and \"America\". Each song has its own identity, a very meaningful, simple song called \"fragile heart\" has the butterflies going with its gentle vocals and basic drum beat. This album is most definately in my top 5 albums of all time. The lyrics are very clever and much thought went into writing them, i would recommend anyone to read the lyrics whilst listenning for the first time. Well done to Jewel for creating uplifting songs in pop style with no sign of cheese but perfectly wrote upmarket, styled music!","classification":5}
{"text":"When this box set finally arrived the other day I was instantly struck with the beautiful packaging this box set has. The colours and 10\" box set look great as is the superb colour booklet that contains many pictures of the band. As well as very comprehensive info on the tracks on the CDs.\nThe first CD I played was the bonus 5 song EP. This is a superb disc in its own right. The medley track is a revelation as is the instrumental bonus song Dust To Dust.\nThe track selection on the 4 main CDs is going to disappoint some purists and fans of Sly Stone, but I have enjoyed the many songs that are not that familiar to me, especially the many sessions from 1967 included in this box set. 1967 was a very prolific time for Sly and the band.\nThe Mono Singles included are interesting with a different sound and feel to the stereo versions. What impressed me is the sound quality of these tracks, they sound fresh and with more dynamics.\nI am also impressed with how good Sly's later music is. He continued to produce good music up to the mid 1970s despite his issues with drugs.\nSadly he has not produced anything like the music Sly made from the tracks on this box set. We are lucky to have a box set of some great music that has a happy vibe and great melodies that I am enjoying immensly.","classification":5}

I thought her voice was so unique and powerful, and I just loved her sound overall. With that being said, I was waiting for this album release for quite some time.\nI've had \"My Garden\" for a few months now, and I do like the album overall. However, it's definitely not a collection of her best work.\nI would have to say the best tracks on the album are:\n\nGangsta, Crazy, Saturday Sunday, I think I'm In Love, Tumbao, Mirror, and Clocks.\n\n\"I think I'm In Love\" and \"Mirror\" are probably my favorite tracks off the album (although I've already been listening to Mirror for years now).\nThe track \"My Garden\" is very boring to me...I'm very confused as to why she made a video for it (which is also boring). However I did recently find out she's referring to her vagina when she says my \"garden\"...so that does make things a bit more interesting I guess.\n\nHowever, if you liked this album, be sure to check out her EP called \"Seeds\". There are quite a few tracks on there that I think should have been added to this album...or one track should have at least been used to replace the track \"Lava\", which I find to be the worst song off My Garden.\n\nOverall, the album is far from bad. At the end of the day I love Kat Dahlia, but I think she could have made a better debut album.","classification":4}

{"text":"People, if you haven't bought this album yet, go buy it today.  There is a reason that people love this woman.  Yes, she is unapologetically blunt (when it comes to sex, drugs and everything in between), yes, she dabbles with drugs in real life, and yes, her sound is authentic and DAMN good.  I think I'm in love with that voice.  I'll tell you why.....\n\nAmy's voice is at once sexy, sensuous, expressive and seductive, and her band is seamless (great horn and percussive section!).  What's more, her lyrics are fantastic and unabashedly honest (at times lewd, yes, and allude to her addiction to blow AKA cocaine).  She is probably best known for \"ReHab,\" \"You Know I'm No Good\" and \"Back to Black.\"  I feel like I am back in  1960, listening to soul, and then the expletives come pouring out....but, smooth as silk.  You can't blame the girl for being angry.  I don't know if Amy has just had some tough luck with men, or whether they just take delight in treating her like trash.  At any rate, this woman totally channels the rush of emotions that comes with broken relationships, as well as the rush of drug addiction.  If you want to hear a good example of the broken-ness, I reccomend \"Me & Mr. Jones.\"  (or most of the other tracks!)\n\nThis woman is amazing.  I just hope (and I say this with sincerity), that she doesn't overdose before her remarkable career truly fluorishes worldwide.  Note:  As I said before, this album is explicit and has references to sex and drugs (quite graphic sex, at times).  Still, this is one of the best soul albums I have heard.

She's like, 'fine, keep crushing my heart if it makes you feel better', but she still can't bring herself to leave him. It's like an anti-torch song, or more like a flame thrower song.

This is a very solemn song about how money does not matter when someone dies.  Learning How To Live is a song about learning how to move on after breaking up with someone.  The lyrics in the song are very meaningful to me.  Lucinda gets help with some talented musicians on this CD.  Come On is a track about feeling frustrated in a relationship.  Doug Pettibone gives this song a nice edge playing the electric guitar here.  Jim Keltner provides a sexy deep drum beat on the track Wrap My Head Around That.  I liked all the tracks on this album very much.","classification":5}
{"text":"It's all about going into space for Kid Cudi on Satellite Flight, or so it would seem. Actually it is more likely a metaphor for taking us listeners into new, unexplored dimensions of thought, not new territory for the expansionist thinker Kid Cudi. The album is enveloped in Cudi's deep, uninterrupted singing voice with one rapping verse inserted in the thick of the album. It is quite the experimental pop\/rnb affair, hardly a hip hop album to be correct. Cudi is in typical form lamenting, crowing, and going on in that jazzy, stylistic way of his about his mental separation from society. When he is not singing and besides the one rapping verse on the album, large swaths of intergalactic instrumentals mellow out the proceedings. Satellite Flight: The Journey To Mother Moon definitely has Kid Cudi's patented musical vibe even if it cannot be classified or critiqued as a rap album. Within the genre that Cudi has invented for himself, whatever the name, the album is a respectable one.","classification":2}

I enjoy very much being able to listen to these works in the background while reading. The performances are very satisfactory.

But much better from this album, and apparently they know it too since it was Track 7, is Master And Servant.  Both of these songs have meaning.  Both songs have a great sound.\n\nDepeche Mode is really, quite honestly, a group a guy like me -- and I'm far from what they would think would have been their fan base at nearly 60 years old -- likes.","classification":5}

{"text":"Remember back in 1996 when everyone came back to New Edition for their reunion album? Then Bobby Brown said he could make more money by himself, and everyone said he was coming off too cocky. Well, Johnny Gill released a new solo album at the same time New Edition's Home Again came out, so wasn't he being a little cocky himself? Yeah, everyone knows Johnny can do his thing solo, but to be honest, this wasn't his best album.\nTake the Babyface-penned title track, for example. The song sounds fine until you get to the chorus: \"Let's get the mood right\/Turn on your heart light.\" Turn on your heart light? That's too cheesy, even for Babyface. And \"Love In An Elevator\" is full of corny lyrics like \"They say there's no luck on the thirteenth floor\/But I found love and so much more\" and \"Like The Staples, I wanna take you there.\" \"Simply Say I Love You\" is okay, but the album said Stevie Wonder is featured in this song. Maybe it's just me, but I don't remember hearing Stevie in that song.\nThe only songs that really stand out are \"Maybe\" and \"It's Your Body\". The latter features Roger Troutman, and we all know that slow Roger Troutman songs are irresistible. The thing that really brings the other slow songs down is that they all talk about the same thing: sex, sex, and more sex. The sleepy production doesn't make things better, either.\nAnother problem on this album are the corny uptempo songs, especially the very last track, \"So Gentle\". It features a rap from Ron DeVoe, so you know what the main problem is. But the thing is that the preceding song \"I Know You Want Me\" features uninspired rapping from some other guy, and his rapping is actually worse than Ron's.\nI still like Johnny Gill, but this album seems like it was rushed. And the strong adlibs he's known for usually adds feeling to the songs, but here it seems like they're trying to hide the questionable material. You're better off getting the solo albums he made before this.","classification":3}

{"text":"It was only a couple of years since the 'Camelot' days had passed and only a year before a decade of troubles that this clarion-voiced trio sang one of their most iconic songs.  'Puff\" is, of course, not a children's song, but a song for adults about childhood.  When we first heard it in 1964, we went nuts over it.  Now years later when I heard it again, I had trouble suppressing my emotions.  Where are the song writers and singer like them today?  I only bought the single, but I might go back and buy the album.","classification":5}
{"text":"\"The Girl Is Mine\" was the first single off the Thriller album and was a duet with Paul McCartney. It was released in October 1982, a month and half before the album itself.  The song is a light, fluffy piece of pop music that didn't really set a good tone of what to expect from the album, but it is an infectious piece of ear candy.  Mr. Jackson has said that the song's recording was one his favorite moments in the studio and you can hear the good times reflected in the song.

WHAT a voice!! It reminded me of the time years ago when I first heard Jim Neighbors (\"Gomer Pyle, USMC\") sing - I was literally blown away by that voice! Who'd of thought that Gomer Pyle, of all people, had a voice like that!! Well, Israel Kamakawiwo'ole has that wonderful voice!! Well worth the buck paid - I'm gonna look into his other stuff as well.

It touches the soul very strongly and you cannot tear yourself away from these inspirational tunes.\n\nThe album opens with a composition Afternoon Reverie which penetrates to the depth of your heart and easily evokes memories of the brightest moments of your life. The second composition Returning Home continues this mood and you can remember when you were a child and your parents were with you and the future seemed so happy and full of hopes for the better...\n\nThere is an important feature present in the music of Jeff Bjorck. It brings you a sense of security and confidence that everything will be fine. Besides, it undoubtedly arouses a strong therapeutic effect and may be perfectly used in the various restoring practices.\n\nI can compare the tunes of Jeff Bjorck with a pure stream of refreshing water. When you drink it, you feel a sense of vivacity. And one wants to live and to create.\n\nThe music of Jeff Bjorck has one more important feature. It helps to open your eyes and to see how surrounded world is beautiful. You can see all its incredible colors and inhale its heady scents profoundly.\n\nThis music wakes up the imagination and it is very sensual also. Without a doubt you will want to listen to the album Keepsakes in the Attic time and again.\n\nWhat more can be said about this striking release? Classical training is felt in the tunes of Keepsakes in the Attic. Especially I sense it in the composition Midnight in Moscow.\n\nJeff Bjorck is a brilliant pianist. The sound of his newest album is refined and it is beyond praise. All nuances of this release are played with a big finesse. Besides, Id like to pick out the composition Playing Catch with Dad. It is filled with deepest emotional experiences and provokes sweet tears of childhood memories.\n\nOne wants to believe in yourself with the music of Jeff Bjorck and live life to the fullest","classification":5}

{"text":"It is honestly and absolutely sad when someone young and talented has thrown their voice away. Unfortunately Rihanna has been one of those singers that has been more of a product, than a real singer. The past few years have shown a lag in better music from her, after the wasted time prepping for her Anti album. The set of songs that she had came out the past few years like B&&&& Better Have My Money and American Oxygen, were overall not included on the final product which became Anti, and for her lead single from Anti, Work with Drake, Rihanna had sounded more like she was high on drugs, than made a solid song because she really felt more tired and choppy in her work. Now for her second single, Kiss It Better, she is trying to be more of a sex symbol in her song, and sadly she doesn't pull it off. I really wasn't impressed at all. After she tried to make a better song, where she sounded weak, and now she is trying to be a sex symbol, and she doesn't pull it off. I think Rihanna needs to find much better in her work, and take a long break from singing, to find herself all over, because she hasn't yet kissed it better.\n\nSong: D","classification":2}

I have never heard this song with a banjo accompaniment.  The banjo playing by Country Winston Marshall makes this song special for me. \"I Will Wait\" is a track where all four musicians perform in perfect unison. Ted Dvane plays the upright bass. Ben Lovett brings his energy on the keyboards on this song. This is an upbeat love song. \"Holland Road\" is a track that features the mandolin.  This instrument makes a goregous sound.  It gives this song a romantic tone that I love. \"Not With Haste\" is a song that I originally heard on the the soundtrack for the animated movie Brave.  It is listed under the song title \"Learn Me Right\". This song fills my heart with a sense of hope. I don't care what title this song is listed as.  It is simply superb. \"Hopeless Wanderer\" is a song that starts off slow, but it picks up in the middle.  I really love the musical arrangement on this track.  \"For Those Below\" is a pretty song with fiddle playing.  This song has a spiritual theme in the lyrics that I love.

{"text":"It is absolutely so sad whenever someone young and talented dies early & before their time. With the shocking news of the passing of Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, it is just another tragic reminder of Rock & Roll excess from drugs, alcohol and depression. It is just a tragic reminder of how very fragile someone's life can really be from beginning to end. Soundgarden really was more of a underrated band in the realm's of grunge music's legacy. Where as the case with Pearl Jam & Nirvana being looked upon as music legends. But Chris Cornell did show a sincere voice with a very fragile heart at the soul. That is the case with some of Soundgarden's masterpieces, and Black Hole Sun has remained the Soundgarden opus that many fans will continue to come back to. The song has been a very deep hard rock delight at despair, sorrow and prayer at the soul of the rifts by the guitar.

{"text":"There is no question that this year marks Elton John's 45th Anniversary since he & Bernie Taupin met and became one of the most definitive songwriting teams in the world. There have been so many classics that have been so strong for both of them. But of all of them from the 80's, the one that stands out intimately the most is Sacrifice from his 1989 album Sleeping With The Past. It is a very classic piano ballad that sits well, where in a era of songs that were tacky and not as strong from Elton, because of his abuse and marriage ended, it still stands absolutely tall from Elton in voice and harmony. If you're new to Elton John, this is a nice download as well as for die hard Elton John fans, and that is a sacrifice worth taking.\n\nSong: A-","classification":5}

{"text":"Type O Negative's most recent album, \"Dead Again\" gets re-released and repackaged with a bonus DVD.  For those who have already picked up \"Dead Again\", this new edition is only worth picking up for die hard fans of the band.  The bonus DVD includes the live Wacken performances of fan favorites \"Kill You Tonight\", \"Love You to Death\", \"Anesthesia\", and \"Christian Woman\", along with the videos for \"The Profits of Doom\" and \"September Sun\".  An interview with the band is included as well, but it's nothing special, even though it concludes with Josh Silver touring Coney Island, which is actually pretty funny.  As for the album itself, you can check my old review for a more detailed take on it, but other than the DVD and new red colored cover, this is the same \"Dead Again\" that you picked up last year.  That's not a bad thing for more casual or new fans to the band who haven't picked up \"Dead Again\" yet, of which by all means this is the edition to pick up.  Other than that though, unless you are a die hard fan who needs to own everything Type O Negative, or you don't own \"Dead Again\" at all, this re-release isn't all that worth picking up.","classification":4}

{"text":"Pet Shop Boys' last album, Yes, was rather lackluster.  It had some good moments, but overall it seemed a bit flat.  Before that, Fundamental was pretty good yet still failed to live up to the truly great albums like Very, Behaviour, or even Release.  So it was with a cautious ear that I listened to their latest offering, Elysium.  I am pleased to report that this album redeems all past mistakes.  PSB has crafted a truly blissful offering filled with intelligent and mature electropop.\n\nThe most striking aspect of Elysium that most people will notice is that the album isn't a four-on-the-floor dance record.  It's not Nightlife.  In fact, it's closer to a combination of Behaviour and Release.  It's got pop ballads and mid-tempo gems, but nothing for clubs.  This isn't a bad thing...as PSB seems to really nail it when they go this route.  I read some of the other reviews and it seems many were disappointed because they were expecting something more upbeat.  But if one listens without expectations, they will be pleasantly surprised.  There isn't a single track on this album that I want to skip, which is nice as the last album was so sketchy.\n\nThe best tracks on here are definitely \"Leaving\", which has some really chic arrangement, \"Invisible\" is melodic and heartfelt, \"Breathing Space\" is like a more accessible version of Release's \"Birthday Boy\", \"Ego Music\" is erratic and experimental, reminiscent of something you'd hear from the French duo Air, but still works wonderfully here.  In fact, starting with \"Ego Music\" the album delves into full concept album mode.  Mixing broadway-style numbers like \"Hold On\" with the gloriously dark and abstract \"Everything Means Something\".  Truly mesmerizing stuff!\n\nThis is truly the Pet Shop Boys' most beautiful and lush album to date.  I truly hope the people giving it negative reviews will click to this album.  It truly cannot be missed.","classification":5}

Young Mc even refers to himself as a one-hit-wonder, but it's impossible not to also love \"Principal's Office\", \"Non Stop\", \"Know How\", and many others.

{"text":"I was impressed with this album even though it was claimed to have \"Tibetan\" significance apparently for marketing appeal.  Ringing bowls are not unique to the small fringe group of Buddhist that reside in Tibet.  In this rendition of \"singing bowls\" they pass for bowl sounds but at higher volume one can detect the a difference in the actual character of the bowls and recognize the telltale sign of the synthesizer.  Hopefully you will get an opportunity to actually hear an ensemble of Buddhist using the authentic bowls for meditation purposes and not for entertainment.  A significant difference in sound is that the striking of the bowl is minimized and the emphasis of in the tone produced by \"stirring\" the striker around the rim actually produces the harmonics that can continue indefinitely.  At higher volume the harsh abrupt intense tone sounds much more appropriate for a bell.  Bells are also used to variable degrees in Buddhism and Hinduism and many other religions.  The \"singing bowl\" established a significant hold in the USA with the Flower Children and the New Age religious movement.  The actual bowls are limited in number as they were all handmade and harmonically tuned by highly skilled master craftsman utterly devoted to their task.  Enjoy this album for what it is, an attempt to simulate instruments that were designed and constructed exclusively for sacred mediation and use them to play music that will entertain us.  It actually is entertaining.","classification":4}

{"text":"The great William Bell is back with Stax where he first arrived 55 years ago, and the result is is one of the finest traditional soul albums of the century, rivaled only by the late Otis Clay, Johnny Rawls and Bettye LaVette.  This is superlative Memphis-style southern soul, no matter if it was recorded in NYC and produced by a man (John Leventhal) more associated with alternative country, particularly the magnificent albums of his wife Rosanne Cash.  As a matter of fact, Leventhal and Cash wrote one of the many new masterpieces contained here, the warmly and deeply soulful and wise \"Walking on a Tightrope.\"  I wouldn't be surprised if they also had the idea for William Bell to cover the ultra-poignant and and wise (wisdom about growing old with a lifetime of experience) \"All Your Stories,\" the stunning acoustic-ballad closer from Jesse Winchester's 1972 landmark alternative country LP \"Third Down, 110 to Go.\"\n\nWilliam Bell co-wrote everything else here, including his 1960s masterpiece (one of several) \"Born Under a Bad Sign,\" immortalized as an all-time Memphis Stax blues classic in 1967 by the incomparable Albert King.  For this revival of the song, Bell and Leventhal wisely make it more of a steadily-building acoustic-led blues, rather than trying to compete with Albert King's electric guitar pyrotechnics.\n\nThe rest are all newly written songs by Bell and Leventhal, some with Marc \"Walking in Memphis\" Cohn.  \"Mississippi-Arkansas Bridge\" mixes Memphis with a Tony Joe White-like mlange of bayou blues, rock and soul.  So many others are hauntingly poignant, pensive and personal (\"More Rooms,\" \"The Three of Me,\" \"The House Always Wins,\" \"All the Things I Can't Remember\").  \"Poison in the Well\" is a pulsating grabber about a woman so tempting she can precipitate a man's fall from grace; while \"I Will Take Care of You\" is a purely devotional slow southern ballad.\n\nThe title song (\"This Is Where I Live\") is autobiographical and extols Memphis as his home.  \"People Want to Go Home\" is the moving closer all about returning home, and it features a superbly soulful chorus behind him.\n\nThis beautifully produced and performed album is of 39 minutes duration, but it feels as though I just read an autobiography of the man and artist, William Bell, that delves deep into his emotions and his soul.  The world's greatest author on the subject of soul music, Peter Guralnick, contributed three pages of brilliant liner notes to this project.  I agree so much with his statement that \"[the] combination of introspection and universality is what has always given William's music its unique feel...\"  Never more so than now,\n\nThis is phenomenal, and we can only hope there will be more like it.","classification":5}

{"text":"Jason Mraz is back with new material - finally.\n\n\"I Won't Give Up\" is one of his brightest successes, having crashed into the Top 10 of the Hot 100 on the exclusive strength of paid downloads. This indicates the loyalty of Mraz's fan base, which he has steadily accumulated through over a decade of perfecting his art in front of live audiences.\n\nStill, \"I Won't Give Up\" is a questionable choice as a radio single, especially the lead single from his forthcoming album, due out in May.\n\nGranted, its subject matter - an altruistic search for intimacy, belonging and camaraderie, all starting with one person - is typical for Mraz (perhaps too typical), and it also happens to be a strong song. His delivery is confident, considered and certainly compelling.\n\nIt differs from Mraz's Grammy-winning \"Make It Mine\" (which was, amazingly, not a hit) or \"I'm Yours\" (which certainly was) in that its melody is not straightforward and its tempo is not consistent. It has a rather scattered feel and arrangement, veering between Mraz singing both high and loud and soft and mellow. It is also four minutes in length and takes 90 seconds to reach its chorus - in the minds of radio station programmers, a long time.\n\nIt is lyrically satisfying, and a couple of verses are reminiscent of past tunes such as \"Please Don't Tell Her\" and \"If It Kills Me.\" It certainly communicates Mraz's persona and philosophy clearly and effectively.\n\nIt is hard not to initially wish for something a bit more well-rounded, direct and soulful when considering prior singles such as \"Make It Mine\" or \"You and I Both,\" or even albums cuts like \"Clockwatching\" which could have easily been hits. He must be commended, though, for a change of pace.\n\n\"I'm Yours\" hardly sounded like the rest of what was on the airwaves in 2008 and it shattered records and continues to receive massive airplay; lack of conventionality has paid off for Mraz in the past. Still, \"I Won't Give Up,\" while strong, is a risky choice for a single. It has surely already been labeled by many station programmers as too winding and complex for heavy radio rotation.","classification":4}

Rachel Patten has been one of those artists that has really came out of nowhere with her breakout song Fight Song this past year, that has really worked for her. But trying to follow it up, is more than met the eye overall. Rachel's song, Stand By You, the second single from her debut album Wildfire, isn't actually one of her better songs. I really didn't find the song to have the longevity that could've been shown beyond the words of the soul. I personally wasn't moved with this track at the spirit.

For a 60-year old British soul singer to appear on the current American pop charts with a jazz standard is just awe-inspiring, and cause for celebration.\n\nAnnie recently performed \"I Put A Spell on You\" on February 8, 2015 at the Grammy Awards, as a duet with Hozier, along with his Grammy song-of the-year nominated \"Take Me To Church.\"  Annie's red-hot rendition of \"I Put A Spell On You\" left the seasoned music Grammy audience spellbound and electrified.\n\nThe studio recorded track appears on both Annie's recent album \"Nostalgia\" as well as the soundtrack to \"Fifty Shades of Grey.\"  On the studio recording, Annie makes these classic lyrics her own.  With trademark blue eyed soul, Annie travels the journey from pleading to her lover, plaintiff yearnings, to controlled, authoritative declarations of unending devotion.  The orchestral and piano soundscape perfectly support the steely strength of her remarkable vocals.\n\nI have listened to this track several times and continue to appreciate Annie's artistry and dedication to sharing her talent on worthwhile and significant contributions to her growing catalog of work.  I highly recommend adding Annie Lennox's \"I Put A Spell On You\" to your music library.\n\nRob.","classification":5}

I swear i'll never understand why people feel the need to trash on something simply becuase they don't like it.\n\nDespite what you'll hear from these retards below me, TSL's \"say it like you mean it\" is legendary, marking one of the last good DTR releases, before they went downhill. Each one of the record's 13 songs are amazing, and no two sound similar in the least. High production value and good mixing only add to this records greatness, and you'll probably have it in your cd for more than a couple weeks before moving on to something else.\n\nStandouts would have to include the infectious \"up and go\", the first single \"best of me\", the punk rocker \"hello houston\" and the somber acoustic ballad \"the drama summer\". Other noteworthy tracks include: \"the leaving song\" and \"left coast envy\". Pretty much any fan of pop-rock in general can find something to appreciate on \"say it\", and because replay value is so high, you find that the songs that just didn't stick before get better and better with time\n\nTSL has since released a load of crap called \"based on a true story\". This record is nothing like \"say it\", and if you're only going to buy one TSL record, make it \"say it like you mean it\". I seriously hope these guys can come out of their slump and put out an amazing third release.","classification":5}

{"text":"It would be fair to say that by 2010 Jorn Lande is a well established presence in the rock\/metal genres both as a band member and solo artist. Throughout his solo career his admiration for classic hard rock led him to covering songs of `Deep Purple', `Black Sabbath', `Thin lizzy' and `Whitesnake' amongst others both on record and on stage.\n\n`Dio' is Jorn's tribute to the legend and his music featuring the original brand new track `Song for Ronnie James' plus twelve cover versions of the giant's songs. It really comes as no surprise that Jorn performs the songs impeccably to the letter; what perhaps is unexpected is the performance of his band which is somewhat superior to their previous studio performances, as they are indeed on fire. To his credit `Jorn' does not concentrate on the legend's hits but actually builds a compilation of his own favorite `Dio' songs; therefore you get trademarks such as `Stand up and shout', `Don't talk to strangers' and `Sacred heart' but you also find more obscure material such as `Night people', `Lord of the last day' and `Push'.\n\nEven though I do not want to, I have to address theories of `Cashing in'; But for anyone who is willing to see the bigger picture, would realize that this choice is actually a bold move of Jorn definite to bring him a fair share of negative heat while financial rewards are very uncertain. (One could claim that it is rather nave to speak of cashing in from CD sales at this day and age.)\n\nBeyond this there is not much left to analyze regarding this album; simply it's one man's tribute to one of the greatest musical personalities of our time. It is not to say goodbye, it is to keep him alive.","classification":5}

The end of her relationship with her fiancee Future had ended with him cheating on her, and also her music has not really been anything extraordinary. The latest set of songs she had come out with have been poor, than anything that really comes from the impassioned heart. The setup for her last couple of albums Ciara and Fantasy Ride have been much more lackluster than strong. I really did not find the songs like Body Party and Love, Sex & Magic to be anything impressive. Dance Like We're Making Love, the latest song from her upcoming album Jackie isn't anything that ignites at all. She tries to be seductive, but honestly Ciara instead feels more like a whimper alone. The song feels weak and her tone into the song sincerely is not anything that is special. If Ciara really is going to keep making poor songs, I think it is honestly time for her to considering retiring from a music career. Her next album should have better than this song really did.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2}

{"text":"So anytime a band sets off to deliver a 2 or 3 part concept album over the course of multiple years its easy to question how consistent and cohesive the project will be by the time of its completion  assuming it actually even reaches completion. So its a daunting task to say the least even for the greatest of bands. Even the mighty Dream Theater have never accomplished this feat (Metropolis the closest theyve come to attempting) Well congratulations to Vanden Plas  a band quite accomplished in the realm of epic concept albums  for not only completing the task within a year but also for keeping the story, the sound quality and the production all consistent. For those not familiar with the first half of the project please refer to my review posted below. For those who have been eagerly awaiting the sequel to Path 1, you won't be disappointed. As good as the opening act was, Path 2 is fierce, dark and delivers a much heavier collection of songs. One of my reservations with Path 1 was the somewhat more subdued nature of the songs  almost like the band was holding something back. Here, the tempo has been lifted throughout. And while there are still balladic moments throughout, I just think this disc is a much more intense listening experience. And while Vanden Plas has never been a shred band, these songs are crushing at times, yet remain melodic and passionate, which is the Vanden Plas way.\n\nAndy Kuntzs ageless vocals still carry the band but everyone else has stepped up the performance factor as well  Wernos  synth contributions  coming to the forefront of the mix. His piano has always been integral to the Vanden Plas sound, but I love the diversity of keyboard sounds he brings forth on this disc. Andreas Lills drumming plays a greater role compared to Path 1 where he seemed to keep things fairly straight-forward  much more complexity, more double bass thumping and quite a bit more tempo all around. And the guitars of his brother Stephen Lill just shred  plenty of soloing leads this time around. I love the opening track In My Universe and the epic Blood of Eden  a perfect song in 3 parts  the middle section with this insane speaking in tongues vocal part where Kuntz showcases his talent for seamlessly shifting back and forth between multiple languages. For me this song is the highlight of the entire 2 disc project. Its dynamic, heavy, symphonic, melodic and beautiful all at the same time. The slightly commercial Monster is another hit where the main character realizes what he has become. Where Have the Children Gone is a dynamic power ballad which echoes back to Path 1 and then the tandem of The Last Fight and Circle of the Devil serve as the grand finale to the story.\n\nWith Path 2 not only has Vanden Plas effectively closed the circle on this series (in a timely fashion no less), but they have delivered yet another musical masterpiece  one which may just have topped all of their concept stories to date. Even if you are not a fan of the lyrical content (Im neutral not having read the books), the music alone will mesmerize. And for those who felt Path 1 was a bit more of a symphonic rock affair (and a bit subdued), I can assure you that Path 2 delivers a much more satisfyingly heavy progressive metal opera experience.\n\nFor those that care about this kind of thing: the trifold digipak packaging is consistent from Path 1 to Path 2 yet the band pictures and graphics varied enough to give each Path its own distinctive \"look.\"\n\nPath 1 - Germanys Vanden Plas, who started their career in the 90s with a melodic metal style (Colour Temple) and then joined the commercial progressive metal genre ala Dream Theater with 1997s The God Thing  and 1999s Far Off Grace, have evolved into a progressive metal opera band over the course of the past decade. This new release follows in the same concept metal opera vein as 2006s Christ O and 2010s The Seraphic Clockwork.\n\nThe band line-up remains basically intact with Stephen Lill (guitars), Gunter Werno (keys), Andreas Lill (drums) and Andy Kuntz (vocals) The new release is based on a series by the same name created by renowned German fantasy\/sci-fi author Wolfgang Hohlbein who has been a fan of the band for some time and agreed to collaborate with them on this project. This is the first installment in the series. Without going in to much detail, the story chronicles the struggles of an immortal man to choose his destiny based on visions he is receiving from a satanic shape-shifter trying to trick him into giving up his humanity in exchange for the power to become a god.\n\nMusically, this follows closely with what has gone before, but I think the songs are better than on the last release. Kuntz sounds great  like his voice hasn't aged in the past 15 years  and Lills guitars anchor the Vanden Plas sound amidst the cacophony of choral arrangements, piano interludes and powerful drumming. Its basically a formula that has worked very well for this band for years and they remain consistent and engaging on all levels. Multi CD releases are tough to complete over long periods of time so I suspect we won't have to wait another 4 or 5 years for the sequel. I don't really think there is anyone else out there right now doing the rock opera thing as well.","classification":5}

Since I'm a writer, songs having this effect is a good thing for me. On the one hand, this song tells a very specific story that you can picture being played out, but it also conveys an emotion that I think is so easy to connect to other things.

{"text":"I am a fan of the White Stripes.  In general their music is sparsely produced.  There are performers that when they release an album or song, each and every sound is engineered, buffered, truncated, and modified to be exactly what they want.  In some cases the works contain notes and sounds that real people cannot produce in real time.  That is not Jack and Meg White.  By refraining from over producing a song more of the emotion, the drive remains.  Musically this is a song on the raw side.  Vocally it is emotion driven and that is an honor that can be laid at the feet of the likes of Eric Burdon of the Animals, Jerry Lee Lewis, Howling Wolf,James Brown and many of the delta bluesmen.  Ozzy Osborn has the edge on good days.  They have the ability to drive the feelings they have with their lyrics and the voice.  The white stripes do this and this is one of their better songs.  The lyrics are allegorical but not inaccessible and that bears repeating.  He and Med are telling a story.  There is always a tiny bit of doubt that you may not be hearing the story they are singing and that is just great.  Rock should not always make you comfortable.  For my taste one of their more powerful songs is their cover of Jolene.  Jack White takes a maudlin, sweet song of worry and rips the facade away to show the fear, pain and the teetering injustice of a possible unbearable betrayal.  Listen to Dolly Parton's Jolene then play Jolene by the White Stripes.","classification":4}

{"text":"Earth Wind & Fire: Greatest Hits has many hits that I remember from when I was a kid in school; it brings back a lot of memories for me. This is a strong single CD compilation although as others have noted it doesn't give you every last one of their hits. However, what we do get is very high quality control music from Earth Wind & Fire; and that's great. The quality of the sound is excellent and I like that artwork, too.\n\n\"Shining Star\" rocks! This came out and hit the airwaves big time! Earth Wind & Fire simply never sounded better. They really handle this well; they never skip a beat nor do they ever let go of a superfluous note. The tempo and key changes make the number strong; and they sing this very well. \"That's The Way Of The World\" quickly shifts gears for a much more mellow sounding tune; this features the group squarely in the spotlight--right where they belonged and still belong! \"That's The Way Of The World\" was always one of my very favorite Earth Wind & Fire tunes; and I think just one listen will tell you why--this is all THAT good.\n\n\"September\" has an awesome beat that would even get the dead tapping their feet to the rhythm; \"September\" was yet another huge hit that got a lot of airplay when it was originally released. I still hear it sometimes on an \"oldies\" radio station in my area; and that's grand. \"Got To Get You Into My Life\" is one heck of a snazzy tune; they make this a masterpiece and they deliver this with a lot of feeling. In addition, \"Sing A Song\" has them harmonizing to perfection--and beyond! \"Sing A Song\" is another major hit on this CD.\n\n\"Serpentine Fire\" uses the percussion to great advantage; and of course another big hit for this group is \"Fantasy.\" \"Fantasy\" charms me with its beauty and it's truly a stand-out on this album--how could they ever get better than this? I'm amazed. \"Mighty Mighty\" has quite a beat that gets you up and dancing nearly wherever you are; and listen for \"Reasons.\" \"Reasons\" has a mellow, pensive flavor to it that is absolutely stunning--and the backup singers harmonize well.\n\n\"Let's Groove\" is another tune that still sounds good all these years later; and I really like \"Boogie Wonderland\" which Earth Wind & Fire performs with The Emotions. \"Boogie Wonderland\" was a huge success for these artists and I still love to hear it today. \"After The Love Has Gone\" again showcases Earth Wind & Fire at their mellow best; and the album ends strong with Earth Wind & Fire performing \"Getaway.\" \"Getaway\" has a strong beat that makes me want to dance; and it also leaves me wanting so much more!\n\nThis is a great album for fans of Earth Wind & Fire, but if truth be told they would need other CDs to have all of the hits from this fantastic group. This album is particularly good for the casual fan who wants most of their hits on one single CD; and it makes an excellent starter CD for people just discovering the fine talents of Earth Wind & Fire.","classification":5}

It didn't have the same kind of electronic charm as Daft Punk's usual work, far more pop-based and with Willams overtaking their signature robotic vocals.  Much like another reviewer of this song, however, the more I listened to it, the more hooked I became.  It's a catchy song, upbeat and almost impossible not to dance along to.  I would have liked a bit more of Daft Punk's presence in this song than Williams', but that's just my personal preference.\n\nAlso, this song is VERY repetitive, and so it might drive some listeners nuts.  It doesn't bother me too much, however.  And while it might not be my favorite song by the band (I still enjoy \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" and \"One More Time\" more), it's still a good listen, a nice fusion of pop and electronica.","classification":4}

Since their sophomore release this trio from Ireland has grown on me and with '#3', they have become a regular in my listening cycle. Their blend of harmonies and rap along with their one of a kind lyrical capabilities makes '#3'one of the most unique albums of 2012. As a person who was not the biggest fan of their debut, I am now tempted to give it another listen. No two songs on this album sound the same. The meaning of each song is different. Each one puts you in a different mood. Some are sing-a-longs and some are just great listens. One thing is for sure, The Script is now going to be one of those bands that will stand the test of time.

{"text":"I'm not a professional song writer, but I've been a song writer since I was in college. This song has a good beat, and an excellent message, but it's redundant. It's the way that many songs are being written these days. One verse and one chorus is repeated twice and that's the song.\nNow, it is not my intent to denounce artistic creativity, and all that rot. I know what is artistic creativity, and lack of substance in a song is but mere laziness.","classification":4}

{"text":"For more than a decade Johnny Rivers was a consistent hit maker and record producer. His music was a staple of Top 40 radio during a good portion of the 1960's. Most of Johnny's early hits were covers of other artists hits including \"Memphis\", \"Mountain of Love\" and \"Seventh Son\". Then In September 1966 Imperial records released a song co-written by Johnny and Lou Adler that would become the biggest hit of his career. The moving ballad \"Poor Side of Town\" would climb to the top of the charts for one week in the fall of 1966. This recording marked a dramatic change in musical styles for Johnny and was one of the most important records of his career. Many would agree that this was the best song he ever recorded.\nThis is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio","classification":5}

{"text":"Jeepers this was mastered hot, as my poor bleeding eardrums can attest. Terrible overdrive distortion on the percussion (if it's deliberate rather than the result of inattention at the recording desk the engineers need to stop doing it because it's RUINING THE MUSIC) and percussive bass.\n\nOnce the volume is turned down ridiculously (this is possibly the hottest CD master I own) the music is great. The songwriting is superb.\n\nPerhaps the engineers expected this only to be played on a car music system where it doesn't really matter how badly the music is mangled because the stupidly high subwoofer pounding will prevent anyone detecting it anyway, but the music is trying to be wonderful and it's being dragged from awesome to awful because of stupid technical issues we had figured out back in the days of analog mag tape masters.\n\nIt's like no-one knows how to safely \"bend the needles\" these days.\n\nCloser to the live feel than \"Boys and Girls\" as portrayed in their Austin City Limits set, caught on PBS and what fired my desire to listen in the first place, but still missing the key song that made me go \"Who ARE these guys?\"","classification":3}

{"text":"January 1, 2010 (first review of the New Year! 2010, woo hoo!!)\n\nBut at the same time, even with the cool snaps and the extremely powerful high note at the end, this song is missing lyrics. Probably a verse and a couple of choruses. And this is due to the fact that these days you need to have the song fit into a 3 minute length quota which is stupid. Some of the best R&B songs are longer, more subdued tracks.\n\nBut anyway, this remake isn't bad like some say it is but it's not as stunning as the original. It does however, have enough originality and Mariah imprint on it to be likeable.\n\nAll in all, a decent remake but she's done better.\n\nMy biggest qualm is that it was too short. Somehow, if she could have made it a 4 minute affair then this song would probably have scored higher for me.\n\n3.5 stars.\n\nend note: Get Mariah's latest album if you don't already have it. If you are a Mariah fan, and you liked her E=MC2, Emancipation of Mimi and Rainbow albums, then I think this album will be right up your alley. Let it grow on you.","classification":3}

Keith Urban and Miranda Lambert's \"We Were Us\" escapes all the tired tropes of the genre, instead evoking an alive melody that's as fun to sing-along as to listen.\n\nSquarely between the classic love song and breakup tune, We Were Us sits alone as a song about a couple who have already broken up but still pine for each other.  It's not 100% clear from the song whether they want to get back together or just remember their time together as amazing - it lets the listener project how they want that to go.","classification":4}
{"text":"Javier - Javier (Capitol, 2003)\nWhen Javier first released \"Crazy\" last year, I wasn't too, uh, crazy about it because lyrically, he wasn't saying anything new. If you're looking for more original songwriting on this album, you won't find it but you will find some wonderfully sung tracks like \"Song for Your Tears\" and \"Hey Little Sister\". Javier also does a good rendition of the jazz standard, \"October Sky\". Vocally, he is a cross between Eric Benet and Slim from 112. He has a good chance of staying long in the business if he is promoted right. Actually, this album came out last August, I only saw one video from him (\"Crazy\"), and I'm sure this album isn't platinum yet, so the future doesn't look too good.

In particular, Jennifer Nettle's phony, exaggerated twang gets pretty irritating after about four or five songs...

{"text":"AZ (Anthony Cruz) continues to deliver the heat with his latest album \"A.W.O.L.\" (2005). The first real standout for me is \"Never Change\" a cut where AZ reflects about a friend who died, delivering some memorable lyrics and a premium chorus. Wu-Tang's Raekwon and Ghostface then drop in for a solid collaboration repping their city \"New York\". Backed by a crazy beat, AZ rhymes with hunger on \"Still Alive\". My current favorite is \"City Of Gods\", AZ shines rhyming well and laces this one with another impressive chorus. One of the things I have always liked about AZ is he remains genuine. Half-A-Mil was murdered a few years ago, AZ brings him back for the sad and heartfelt \"Street Life\" feat. Begetz. AZ then tells a short \"Bedtime Story\" remembering past years. It's nice to see AZ getting the production he deserves, Premo hooked AZ up for \"The Come Up\" and AZ shines again. Not a Bounty Killer fan, so not feeling \"Envious\", while the title track is solid. The bonus material is decent, good to that CL Smooth is still around feeling \"Magic Hour\". I recently heard another new excellent AZ track called \"Game of Life\", wish that one had been included on this release. For years people have slept on AZ's music, I don't know if that will continue, I do highly recommend checking out \"A.W.O.L.\".","classification":4}

{"text":"I had heard of Matthew West but never given his music much of a chance before I won this CD in a raffle.  As we used to say, \"My bad.\"  If this CD is any indication of what his other releases are like, I've found a new artist to enthusiastically follow.\n\nThe disc starts off with a nice instrumental intro that leads directly into the upbeat, pop sounds of the title track.  It's a fun reminder that God calls us all to share His love as only we can.\n\nBut the one song that seems to be tearing up the charts right now is \"The Motions.\"  And I can see why.  It's a slower ballad that cries out to God to make a change instead of just living a life without feeling or striving to live for Him.  It's a powerful song that leaves me crying out to God myself by the time it is over.\n\nThe disc really does switch between the more serious and the fun.  On the fun side, we've got \"Safe and Sound\" a quiet upbeat song for a new born baby.  But far more serious is \"Life Inside You\" about people struggling to deal with the pains of life.  The song also bounces from the upbeat of \"A Friend in This World\" to the slower \"Save a Place for Me.\"  That last song is perfect as it eloquently expresses the longing to be reunited with a lost loved one in Heaven.\n\nIt's actually pretty hard to pick out one or two favorites.  Every track is just that good.\n\nBut I do have to highlight the disc closer, \"Stop the World.\"  It's a plea for God to speak to us in the silence in our lives.  The guitar ballad is just the perfect note of seriousness to close the disc.  There is a hidden component to this track that has Matthew clowning around with his daughter in the studio.  Fortunately, it is quite skippable.\n\nI definitely need to track down Matthew's other releases.  I can't believe I missed him for so long.  If you've heard any of his songs on the radio and wondered if he was worth buying, the answer is an enthusiastic yes.","classification":5}

{"text":"This was one of Grand Funk's real anthems and one of their most played songs before their big hit period began with We're An American Band in the fall of '73. Grand Funk was never very popular with the critics, largely, I think, because their music was fairly simple and they were real crowd-pleasers, and showed no greater ambitions than that. But these qualities made them vastly popular with the general public who gave them six million-selling albums at a time when AM radio wouldn't play their songs. This song would be heard at rock concerts all over, especially the outdoor concerts. If it was a big concert Grand Funk themselves might be playing it as they toured a lot. But many outdoor summer concerts had good regional or local bands and all of them played this song too. It really captures the feeling of a rock concert circa 1970-71.","classification":5}

{"text":"It's been about five years since Monica last bought us any new music with her previous album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Makings-Of-Me\/dp\/B000HA4WES\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Makings Of Me<\/a>&nbsp;and no matter how you cut it the period about five years before that proved the turn of the millenium just wasn't her decade personally. Well she found a new love in her life and has taken some time off to raise her now two children so here we officially have the birth of Monica:the grown woman. The interesting part of this is,and the reason I will deduct a star from this album is that Monica has versatile vocal style that is more than a little suited to broader,funkier music. On the uptempo songs on this album,including the title song and songs such as \"Mirror\" Monica is producing herself with a very very generic commercial hip-hop sound that interesting enough forces her to sing at a pace a lot faster than normal to accomodate the brittle beats and because of the emphasis on beat rather than rhythm Monica's instrument is smothered by the need to speed up her singing and her special vocal qualities aren't as evident as they should be. Particularly difficult to listen to are the abrasive and by-the-numbers posturing rap on the title song which,even for someone like myself whose open minded to hip-hop kind of emphasizes a lot of the negative modern clishe's of the genre and isn't very welcoming musically. The rest of the album,however is a different story. Her interpretation of Evelyn King's somewhat unheralded \"If You Were My Man\" from the mid 80's get's an appropriate musical backup as Monica more fully explores her range. It's fitting that she chose a song by another former teen soul singer who not only helped pave the way for people like her but who managed to keep up with the times successfully even if her commercial fortunes often abandoned her. Even on the uptempo songs that lack in rhythmic intricacy the lyrics on this album are always arresting and compelling. On the midtempo ballad material such as the wonderful \"Once In A Lifetime\",\"Superman\",\"Love All Over Me\" and the closer \"Believing In Me\" the music takes on a slicker flavor that favors Monica's style a lot better than the overproduction on some of the faster tunes. On the concluding song her lyrics actually take on the topical stance of the modern 30 something and the general rebirth of the \"me\" generation wherein,for better or worse the selflessness involved in romantic relationships has again given way to a  \"me first\" attitude. Even though Monica means what she's saying,the reservation in her vocally delivery on the song isn't lost on me anyway. This is probably the best kind of album Monica could release at this particular time as contemporary R&B,stuck in a strong holding patter for the last decade or so is starting to adapt different elements into itself in order to keep itself fresh. If she expands the slicker elements of her music continually on her next album or two rather than keeps maintaining links to overly bomastic modern hip-hop productions she will definately be onto something.","classification":4}

{"text":"After 'Intimacy' in 2008 it looked like maybe Bloc Party was going to throw in the towel, so just to have them back in 2012 is good enough for this fan! But they've returned with a great album. 'Four' is a definite return to a more 'Silent Alarm' sound. I have loved all of Bloc Party's records, so I liked the 'techno' Bloc Party as well as the more indie rock stuff. 'Four' is strictly a ROCK record, their are no electronic elements on this one. Yes, it is most comparable to 'Silent Alarm' with the angular post-punk guitar sounds, Kele's fantastic voice and melodies and the great bass and drum interplay. But it has a few surprises, mostly notably 2 or 3 songs that are HEAVY. Kele's interviews before the album came out referenced the Deftones, and it's a good comparison, with a handful of tracks (still getting to know the names!) have that heavier guitar crunch like the Deftones, but combined with, again, a 'Silent Alarm' era sound. So overall this is another excellent Bloc Party cd, they sound like a reinvigorated band who felt like they had something to prove, and they did! I can't imagine a Bloc Party fan not liking this!","classification":4}

{"text":"There is no question that when it has came down to Toni Braxton, musically she has shwon no boundaries for all. Her songs from her days with LaFace have been the strike of her career. Un-Brak My Heart, which originally was featured from her 1996 record, Secrets is her strongest opus musically and soulfully. The Diane Warren ballad still remains as strong as stirring as it did when it was released over 15 years ago. While Toni hasn't been able to top what she did with that song, it still is a classic today that hasn't been replicated. There have been others that have done Un-Break My Heart, but no one has done it like Toni Braxton.\n\nSong: A","classification":5}

Before deciding to form his own group in 1966 Sylvester Sly Stone Stewart (lead singer, keyboards) had been producing records for other people including Bobby Freeman and the Beau Brummels. During the late 60s and early 70s the group would have 5 Top Ten hits three of which went all the way to #1. But my personal favorite was the breezy 1969 hit Hot Fun In The Summertime.

{"text":"Listening to A Fine Frenzy's newest album, PINES, I was somewhat bewildered.  I frequently checked the MP3 player to ensure that I was indeed listening to Alison Sudol.  While I absolutely love this album, I'm not sure how most of her fans will receive it.\n\nONE CELL IN THE SEA was a pretty straight-forward pop record.  Sudol's voice and piano were frequently dominating the mix, but at the core of it, the album was a solid work from a great songwriter.  Her second full-length album, BOMB IN A BIRDCAGE, was a bit different.  It didn't feel exactly like a pop record -- Sudol's willingness to try new things made the album different from its predecessor and (at least for me) a great success.  Alison Sudol's third album really comes from left field.  Because BOMB IN A BIRDCAGE dabbled in atmostpherics and electronics, I was expecting something similar, but PINES a stripped down, minimalist affair.\n\nFrom the very first track, it's obvious that this album is going to be different than anything A Fine Frenzy has ever done before.  The introductory track, \"Pinesong\" is slow to begin, and it leads with a wonderful acoustic guitar riff.  The only thing recognizable here is Alison Sudol's wonderful voice -- these songs do have hints of her songwriting, but for the most part, it feels dramatically different.  I honestly don't know if I have seen such a leap in songwriting: PINES is mature, confident, and vulnerable.  \"Riversong\" feels like a reverent prayer to nature, and \"Dream in the Dark\" barely contains more than just Sudol's vocals.  This song sets the pace for most of the songs to come, and mostly, the spare, lonely atmospheres that are created here having a huge beating heart at the core of them.  The tone is so consistent that when \"It's Alive\" comes in with its electronics and percussion, it's a bit jarring, even though his song sounds like something we would have expected from A Fine Frenzy.\n\nWhile I have to say that this is my favorite A Fine Frenzy record to date, it's not without its few problems.  The album isn't always consistent: \"It's Alive,\" and \"Now is the Start\" sound like songs that would have been prepared for BOMB IN A BIRDCAGE.  The melodies aren't as strong here either: there's no \"Almost Lover\" or \"Electric Twist\" that are immediately accessible.  I don't know if I would blindly recommend this to other A Fine Frenzy -- I would strongly recommend fans to sample this album before diving in.  Fans of Sara Bareilles and Norah Jones should find a good bit here to love.  The minimal instrumentation might not be everyone's cup of tea.  Essential tracks to sample\/download: \"Pinesong,\" \"Winds of Wander,\" and \"It's Alive.\"","classification":4}

The concept, which has her playing an android character named Cindi Mayweather, is silly and seemingly pointless. The radio bits, led by the voice of an annoying DJ, are especially distractive. Not that the songs themselves are without fault.\n\nThey are technically engaging. The songstress has a knack for crafting original music that recaptures the vibes of 1970s and 1960s soul. It's Code sounds like a lost Jackson Five ballad while Look Into My Eyes channels Lena Horne. But they don't have the memorable melodies to match. This Electric Lady, even with guest vocalists like Erykah Badu and Prince at her helm, thrives on style over substance.\n\nmarcellee.com","classification":3}

{"text":"On June 21st, 2013, Eddie Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, Wolfgang Van Halen and David Lee Roth played in front of 44,000 fans at the Tokyo Dome in Japan. The performance was recorded, as is, and released, unaltered--with no overdubs, as Van Halen's second official live album, 'Tokyo Dome: In Concert' (2015). The album marks the first live album that Van Halen released with original frontman David Lee Roth, and new bassist Wolfgang Van Halen, who replaced original bassist (and fan favorite) Michael Anthony.\n\n 'Tokyo Dome' offers a generous selection of Van Halen classics. All six albums from the original Roth-era ('78-'84) are represented, as well as Van Halen's excellent comeback album with Dave, 2012's 'A Different Kind of Truth.' You can nitpick about the track selection (I would have liked \"Little Guitars\" to have been included), but the set-list is pretty killer, including many of their major hits and radio staples. Van Halen's new songs from 'A Different Kind of Truth,' \"Tattoo,\" \"Chinatown\" and \"She's the Woman\" blend in seamlessly with such classics as \"Unchained,\" \"I'm the One\" and \"Hear about it Later.\" Eddie, Alex and Wolfgang are one killer powerhouse and sound awesome.  Dave and the band sound polished and well rehearsed, and make a few cool improvisations, like the extended drum\/guitar solo in \"Everybody Wants Some.\" The entire performance is electric and through the 2+ hour show, they never seem to lose momentum or run out of stream. Alex's Vegas-esque, Latin-tinged drum solo and of course, Eddie's solo are also highlights.  Michael Anthony's background vocals are missed, but Ed and Wolf sound pretty good here.\n\nOne complaint about the album is Dave's voice. Fans have commented that Dave's singing sounds strained, weak, etc. Far, far too much has been made of this, in my opinion. Does Dave sound as good as he did in 1980? No, of course not, but he still sounds pretty good; very good considering he was in his late 50's when this album was recorded. I'll admit that I thought Diamond Dave sounded a little off when I heard some of the individual tracks on the radio or online, comparing his current live singing unfavorably with how he sounded on record, 30+ years ago, but when I listened to the new live album, front-to-back, and got into the groove of the show, his singing sounded just fine. And that's what's so great about this album, it's authenticity. Like the great Dean Martin used to say during his performances, \"If you want to hear it straight, buy the album.\" Personally, I would much rather listen to an authentic, organic, live album than some phony, faux one, filled with overdubs and re-recordings, i.e., Van Halen's last live album \"Live: Right Here, Right Now\" (1993). And having seen Van Halen a few times on their last few tours, I can attest that Dave is still a master showman, a true original and consummate entertainer. It's a lot of fun listening to Dave speak in Japanese to the audience during this performance, and he sounds like he is having a lot of fun, once again fronting the Mighty Van Halen.\n\nIf you're like me and have heard every single classic Van Halen song a million times and want a fresh interpretation of the classics, check out Van Halen's 'Tokyo Dome' album. It may not rank up there with Jame's Brown's 'Live at the Apollo,' or KISS 'Alive,' but it's a hell of a lot of fun and an enjoyable listen.","classification":4}

{"text":"I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play \"Amarillo By Morning,\" and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to \"Amarillo by Morning.\"\n\nSo, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy\/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered.","classification":5}

{"text":"Big log was released on Robert Plant's second solo album which was released in 1983. The song features the classic line \"My love is in league with the freeway\" which would be enough to justify its existence alone. The music is laid back, guitar biased and compelling. Theguitar line draws you into the song and Plant's voice works well and conveys the sense of longing for a lost love which is at the heart of the lyrics. The title seemingly has very little to do with the song. This isn't a great treadmill song. It's a late night last beer\/last cigarette song which is lyrical and longing.","classification":4}

{"text":"In typical fashion, we all built Debby Boone up in 1977 ...just to tear her apart not soon after.  Never mind the fact that her self titled 3rd LP \"Debby Boone\" is, in my opinion, a pop vocal classic (\"I'd Rather Be Alone\" is a classic in and of itself, but her version of \"Choosey Beggar\" is an alltime favorite of mine!) or that her country remakes showed a talent bigger than her one-hit-wonder status, Debby was the squeaky-clean religious daughter of Pat Boone and nothing was going to change that.  How sad she records so little and how sad we miss out on hearing more of those amazing vocals on a variety of genres.  We turned our backs, basically stating that nobody wanted to hear from her again.  Oh, how wrong we were.\n\nBut, lucky for us who have been paying attention, as Debby recorded music last year which is both fun, flashy and yeah, pretty darn fantastic.\n\nUptempo tunes show Debby's fun side, which (I think) few people think she has.  The most fun for me is \"Get Me To The Church On Time\", \"Sway\" and a jazzy\/swinging version of \"These Boots Are Made For Walking\".  But once again it's Debby's voice on ballads such as \"Cry Me A River\" and \"More Than You Know\" that sets my heart a-flutter.  She's sounds as crystal clear and darn near perfect on these songs as she did 37 years ago, showing true talent endures through the ages.  Simply put: BEAUTIFUL!!\n\n(The only slight hic-cup for me is a version of \"Mack The Knife\", which in my opinion truly suits a males voice a bit better than a females.  So, it's more of a song choice than an issue with the vocal.  This song, however, no way effects the CD as a whole or it's well deserved 5 star rating.)\n\nNow, however, comes the painful task of waiting years upon years for another wonderful masterpiece from this talented singer.

{"text":"This is only Metallica's 2nd album, but already they were turning into a great, \"thinking man's\" heavy metal.  Sometimes I like to think this is Metallica's debut, because this is really the first album where they became Metallica.  Many early fans bemoan Metallica's later albums, wanting them to return to the days of thrash metal with Kill 'Em All (their weakest album in my opinion).  They say they sold out by using slower tempos and multi instrumentation (like pedal steel guitars and hurdy-gurdy).  The reality is that Metallica has always been ambitious, and here on their 2nd album, they prove in conclusively.  This is a fantastic album, one that has really stood the test of time (it was made over 20 years ago, and still sounds fresh today).  It is loaded with classic Metallica tracks.  The thrash opener Fight Fire with Fire, the fantastic title track, the brilliant For Whom the Bell Tolls, the magisterial, signature track Fade to Black, another majestic, signature track in Creeping Death (one of my all time favorites), and the brilliant, prog influenced instrumental that closes the album, The Call of Ktulu.  It is also interesting to note that Kirk Hammett has a much larger role on this album.  He co-wrote many of the songs, and his lead guitar doesn't seem thrown in like it did on Kill 'Em All.  This is one of my favorite Metallica albums.  It's the 2nd step in a discography that just keeps getting better.","classification":5}

{"text":"There is honestly so much that can be said about traditional R&B. There really has been a huge lag on real music today, especially the heart of real R&B. Unfortunately, with the severe overexposure of Beyonce' Knowles, Rihanna, and Katy Perry, there has honestly been a huge lack of real talent from the heart of the matter with real music. Last year, with the massive success of Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars delivering on Uptown Funk, there really has been a great success with a good song. But trying to follow-up with what Mark had done with Bruno, honestly is not a very easy task at the heart of the matter. Feel Right, teaming up with Mystikal is one of those songs that tries to sound more like the rhythm that James Brown showcased back in the 60's and 70's. But honestly, the song doesn't actually ignite at the soul of the matter. The feeling of Mystikal doesn't actually impress from start to finish. I think that there could be better from Mark Ronson down the road. Hopefully, something more to feel right more.\n\nSong: C","classification":3}

{"text":"Just about everything bad and good has been said about this album. 50 Cent's major debut was a decent album in 2003 that was highly blown out of proportion on how good it was (sort of like Nelly's \"Country Grammar\") but there are some good parts to it and some bad parts to it. 50 Cent's gangsta attitude would be shown all over the album, mostly about guns, sex, drugs, and money. The 2003 rap song of the year \"In Da Club\" was overrated to me, but it was a decent track at best. The second single \"21 ?'s\" I hated because of it's pop style and lack luster beat that it carries. The third single \"Many Men\" was one of my favorite tracks that was dedicated to more violence. The fourth single \"P.I.M.P.\" was a medicore song about pimping on the origonal version, although the remix that features Snoop Dogg and G-Unit that doesn't appear on here is better. The rest of the tracks range from decent to good that will make your head nod, some I enjoyed and some that I hated. \"Patiently Waiting\" featuring Eminem is possibly one of the best songs on the album, as both of them have above average verses. The track \"If I Can't\" has a fast paced piano beat, that makes the song gangsta and listenable. \"What Up Gangsta\" will have little kids thinking they're hardcore repeating that song, because of it's catchy hook. 50 Cent's slurred vocals could get a liitle annoying at some parts of the CD, because he was shot in the jaw when he took those nine bullets.\n\nProduction is done by Dr. Dre, Eminem, and more.\nIt sold about 9 million copies, so I'm pretty sure that most rap and alternative listener has at least taken a listen.\n\nLyrics: C+\nProduction: B\nGuest Appearances: B-\nMusical Vibes: C+\nOverall: C+\n\nFavorite Tracks: Patiently Waiting, Many Men, If I Can't, Life's On The Line, Wanksta","classification":3}

Of course, that showed examples from a few years ago from acts like Adele and Amy Winehouse to name a few female songstresses. For Lorde, whom is trying to escape the shadows of being underwhelmed and breakout nicely, She showed that brilliantly with her debut single from her album Pure Heroine. Her song Royals worked extremely well that matched heart and soul well for her style. Her second single, Team from her debut record Pure Heroine, isn't actually as strong or driven as was the case with Royals. It is a fairly good song, but not anything that drives like what Royals did before. Hopefully, Lorde can really drive more from her voice with her next single.

{"text":"Recovered from the research notes of Doctor Nathan Farber following his suicide on June 1, 1943.\n\nMarch 6, 1943\nThe first market tests of Bamtantrax are beginning today. As head researcher, I'm to oversee all the tests of the United States division and ensure the product is working successfully and causes no ill effects. In reality, however, I'm just sitting in my office waiting for respondents to the advertisement we put out. I hope we get some suitable subjects to test this on. We really need a success, and not just for financial reasons.\n\nMarch 7, 1943\nI'm impressed. We've already had about 300 applicants in New York alone, and the number is increasing every day. Anyway, we gave them some tubs of Bamtantrax, and asked them to apply the cream daily and report in weekly so we could see the results. They performed their initial application under our supervision. It absorbed into their skin just like tests indicated. Hopefully, full absorption will occur, fixing skin flaws and disfigurements. If that can happen, I have no doubt this'll be the smash hit we're looking for.\n\nMarch 14, 1943\nThe first check-in was today, and it would appear we've got a winner on our hands this time. Everyone who tried the product out loved it. They claim it increased both their attractiveness and their love life, and one woman even claimed it healed a cut she got slicing onions. I don't know about that, but our check-up showed integration with tissue as planned. I think we just need to do this for a few more weeks, then release it to our markets. I'm relaying that opinion to the main branch immediately.\n\nMarch 21, 1943\nWell, it's set. The release date is ready, we're just waiting for the shipments to arrive from the main branch. Everyone in the trial swears by this stuff, and most have referred it to their friends. We're almost out of our test samples, though, and the war has tied up our shipment. We won't get it for a few more weeks. Once they run out, they'll have to do without for a few weeks. The main office still wants us to check up on them weekly, though I have no idea why. The cream works!\n\nMarch 29, 1943\nAnother check-up day. The last subject ran out of Bamtantrax a few days ago, so we'll get to see any negative reactions. Shipment still hasn't arrived yet; my last check-up indicated it was still stuck in a British port. The subjects without the cream for the longest are reporting minor irritation and skin flaking, probably just a side effect from having used the cream so long. Other than that, they report feeling fine, so it's probably nothing.\n\nApril 5, 1943\nI'm beginning to get worried. The rashes are increasing in size and severity, and are turning an ugly purple color. I'd call it a coincidence, but all of the rashes are on the areas of application. Could this be an unknown side effect? I'll send off a message to the main office immediately. If this is a side effect, we need to halt our rollout of it.\n\nApril 12, 1943\nThe rashes are getting worse. Not only in the test subjects, but in the other researchers and staff! They apparently were using some of the stuff as well, and had even hoarded some of it. Disgusting. I'm lodging yet another complain with headquarters, since they still haven't replied to my last one, and recommending they be disciplined posthaste. In the meantime, that shipment needs to get here NOW. I think I can figure out a way to prevent these side effects, but I need more supplies to determine just what it is doing and why these effects are happening.\n\nApril 19, 1943\nMy god\n\nWhat have we done?\n\nThe subjects are dying. Their skin is liquifying, and there's nothing we can do.\n\nThe worst part? It was designed to be that way. I finally got my reply from the main office. It said, and I quote, \"That is what it was designed for. We wanted to guarantee that once they started using Bamtantrax, they wouldn't switch to any other cosmetics. And it's working, too. Ask any one of the test subjects! They want more. And that's what we intend to give them. And to that end, we are pushing up our big rollout to May! We would be delighted to grant your request for a transfer, but the product will be launched as planned.\"\n\nCan you believe it? Our product is killing people, liquifying their skin and they want to roll it out sooner?\n\nI don't know what to do. I've got to do something, but what?\n\nApril 26, 1943\nOh god oh god oh god oh god OH GOD OH GOD\n\nThey're falling apart!\n\nThe secretaries, the test patients, ALL OF THEM!\n\nThey're slowly falling apart and it was because of something I did oh god how could I have thought it was a good idea WHAT HAVE I DONE\n\nThey're justfalling apart. I saw them in the hospital with my very own eyes. I did this. I helped cause this. And they're rolling out! May 1! This causes people's skin to FALL APART and we're selling it! How could we have done it. How could I have done it.\n\nWhat have I done?","classification":5}

{"text":"This is not a Pink Floyd album in the traditional sense. Rather, it is a beautiful collection of instrumental pieces that gives a deep and personal insight into the final recording sessions of the band that came to be known as one of the greatest in the history of music.\n\nThe album is filled with gorgeous and haunting instrumentals that hearken back to other times. There are moments that feel fresh from classic Floyd albums, with Gilmour's stunning guitars calling to mind Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Run Like Hell, Another Brick in the Wall, and many other Floyd classics. Other shining moments remind the listener of Us and Them, Welcome to the Machine, One of these Days, and the list goes on. Yet none of it sounds derivative. This isn't an album of the boys trying to sound like old Pink Floyd. It's a collection of songs that shows the journey from the first days to the final days. It's an epic journey indeed.\n\nThis isn't always a cohesive listen, and it certainly won't fall into the same canon of music as Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall, or Wish You Were Here. But it does have its place on every Floyd fan's shelf.\n\nSure, they could have released this as a bonus disc with a reissue of Division Bell. But then it would've been a lost piece of music rather than the final step in a long and storied journey.\n\nThe album certainly has flaws. Having multiple songs that seem like demos of \"Keep Talking\" is a bit excessive. Of course, the biggest misstep of all is the final track, the only one with vocals. \"Louder than Words\" feels like a Division Bell b-side (the kind you are glad didn't make it onto Division Bell). It's completely unnecessary and serves as a final reminder that this isn't the real Pink Floyd.\n\nBut the rest of the album contains a lot of that old Pink Floyd magic, unleashed for a final time before we all sail off to somewhere better.","classification":4}

{"text":"For such a \"much anticipated\" return to the recording studio by this legendary superband which dominated the radio in the 70's and 80's, this effort falls short of expectations.  While there are a number of highlight moments on this CD, including an energetic \"90 Degrees and Freezing\", a Motown-inspired, horn driven \"Come to Me Do\" and a catchy and powerful pop gem \"Feel\" (all penned by all-time great songwriter Robert Lamm), the record suffers from an over-abundance of ballads and sorry, over-blown production. I'm not a producer, but I know what sounds good to my ears.\nI have nothing against some ballads on a Chicago album, but the ones on this Chicago album, the first recording of all-original material in 15 years, are simply not good, whether from a songwriting or performance standpoint. I won't go down the list, but will cite \"King of Might Have Been\" as an example of bassist Jason Scheff's mostly able tenor painfully straining to hit notes out of his range.\nI don't know what producer Jay DeMarcus was thinking in putting this together as a Chicago CD, but the end result is a lot of tracks sounding like his own band, Rascal Flatts. No more to say as this speaks for itself.  As confirmed by the band, DeMarcus was also responsible for choosing the material for the recording, and pushed aside many songs written by the band members in favor of the mostly trite fare that shows up on \"XXX\". Considering that Robert Lamm and Bill Champlin have proven they can still pen solid pop\/rock\/R&B songs as found on their string of solo recordings, a CD of Chicago-only songs would, undoubtably been more listenable and a more worthy end product than what we hear on \"XXX\".\nFinally, DeMarcus uses an army of studio musicians in place of the actual band members, thereby destroying any integrity this album would have had at least as a document of a Chicago band performance.\n\"Chicago XXX\" \"could have been a contender\" with a different approach to the CD's production.  We'll just have to wait for \"Chicago XXXI\".","classification":2}

{"text":"They redid this song into a smash hit.","classification":5}
{"text":"Let me first make it clear that Jennifer Hudson's first album, JENNIFER HUDSON isn't perfect - it is flawed.  However, despite its flaws, I still think it is an enjoyable enough affair and Hudson shows her vocal skills and prowess, even when the material falls short.  The biggest issues with JENNIFER HUDSON as a whole is that it is at times \"over the top\", much like Hudson was originally on American Idol, Season 3.  Before \"The Circle of Life\" performance that made her the \"highest vote getter\" of the night, many of Hudson's performance were \"manic\" as Simon would say.  Here is the same deal, but not so much because of Hudson's vocals.  Hudson is a powerhouse, and that is well represented on JENNIFER HUDSON.  Sure, she may do one too many runs or overextend her range one too many times, but it is more the material than Hudson this time around.  For example, while the T-Pain duet \"What's Wrong (Go Away)\"  is enjoyable, T-Pain's use of the infamous \"auto-tune\" effect is overused; had T-Pain sang without it, the duet would've been much better.  Again, I have to give Hudson high marks here, for vocals alone.  There is nothing just horrible here as some would say, even when things fall the slightest bit short of great.\n\nThe album opens with my second-favorite song of Jennifer's self-titled debut, \"Spotlight\", which is a fine opener.  I'll admit, sometimes I've grown weary of Stargate's production, but they hit yet another high mark on this exceptional single.  Sure, it may not end up being a mega pop hit, but it is doing relatively well at radio.  Again, Shaffer \"Ne-Yo\" Smith writes another strong song and Hudson sounds like a true R&B diva here.  \"If This Isn't Love\" doesn't compare as highly, though it is solid by all means and Hudson still sounds refined in my eyes.  On the Timbaland produced \"Pocketbook\", I'm on the fence.  Overall, I think it is incredibly corny and stupid, yet still, I'll even admit I've spinned it more than once.  I will say this, \"Timbo\" has done better and maybe this shows some of his influential production-work slackening a bit or even waning slightly.  Ludacris is fine, though I don't think anybody will rate any rapper's verse in such a corny song where Hudson sings coyly \"don't let me have to hit you with my pocketbook\" as high or \"the second coming\".  The Robin Thicke penned and produced \"Giving Myself\" returns Jennifer to what she pulls off the best, adult-contemporary R&B that works well with grown-folks and those who yearn for \"old-school\" powerhouse R&B as opposed to hip-hop influenced soul.  It is exceptional in my mind.\n\nFollow-up track, T-Pain featured\/produced \"What's Wrong (Go Away)\" is good I think, yet I'll be the first to criticize the overproduction via that damn \"auto-tune\" that T-Pain rarely seems to retire.  Hudson sounds good and shows her range, though I think her vocals are the slightest bit \"manic\" here.  Still, it is very enjoyable and I constantly put this record on repeat.  \"My Heart\" (I think produced by Polow Da Don) is average, while Diane Warren penned \"You Pulled Me Through\" is much more sound.  My favorite track is none other than the Fantasia featured,  Missy Elliott\/Jazmine Sullivan penned \"I'm His Only Woman\".  The chemistry of the vocals between these two standout divas is perfect.  In my opinion, Fantasia enhances any song that she's on.  \"I'm His Only Woman\" is a Grammy deserving moment on JENNIFER HUDSON.  \"We Gon' Fight\" not bad, though not a favorite. \"Invisible\" is average, while  \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\" is of course an appreciated reprise appearance on JH.  Closing track \"Jesus Promise Me...\" won't appeal to some, but I thought it was very well sung, if the slightest bit \"draggy\".\n\nOverall, JENNIFER HUDSON serves its purpose to showcase the \"Dreamgirl's\" pipes.  At times, there are slight misses, though nothing that will ruin Hudson's promising career or star status.  I think her second album will be even better than her first.  3.5 stars.","classification":4}

{"text":"At the end of the 70's, Led Zeppelin had their own private jet, multi-platinum albums, several huge world tours, and fame and fortune beyond their wildest dreams. The fans loved them, the critics hated them and just 'didn't GET it, man.'  Sex, drugs, car accidents and rumors of underage girls and black magic, too. The endless tours and life on the road was slowly taking it's toll on the band. So, Page and Plant handed over the reins to John Paul Jones and the result was \"In Through The Out Door\". Soaked in keyboards and vodka, this was to be their final studio album with the legendary John Bonham. It sounds like none of their previous efforts and stands alone as a true classic. 'In the Evening' is majestic in it's sound. So many great tracks from this album! Its often overlooked but time has pressed it into a milestone for the band. A milestone that very few rock n roll acts have yet to even come close to. And to keep the critics at bay, Page released this one in '79 with a simple Brown paper wrapper!","classification":4}

{"text":"With none of the arrangements on Fallen Angels being true to the originals, it would be easy to say that this was just Bob Dylan being Bob Dylan, and putting his personal mark on these songs ... though almost to the point where they are unrecognizable.  I have to wonder whats going on with this his second album of covers, and I have my thoughts, having seen and heard this concept done time and time again by other aging artists.\n\nThere are some muted jazz arrangements here that should stand with more strength and life, yet Dylan, a huge jazz fan, has chosen to nearly hide what he appreciates most.  That Old Black Magic has been turned into a rockabilly shuffle, It Had To Be You barely holds together, as he seems to be nearly reading these songs rather than singing them.  In all honesty, this album sounds like another dreamy look back at his own youth [in much the same manner as Sinatra did] trying to figure out where he fits in during this, the first half of the 21st century, or if it even matters that he does.\n\nCall this gathering of songs whimsical if you will, but please, do not call them great or inspirational, as they come off rather lightweight, shadows of shadows, delivered by a man who may or may not be in the moment as these tracks were recorded.  In a strange way though, the songs all do hang together, but mostly in a manner where Dylan is trying to prove that these vintage ballads are still valid, and thus, if they are, then so is Dylan.\n\nOf course there are those who are gonna tell you that its all brilliant, but its not, and its a real shame that for all his greatness, Bob Dylan cant take his time and present his vision of his later life, or the worlds hes lived through, rather than stepping back into some long lost comfort zone where he no longer needs to gaze out of his window.\n\nBut ... you may find it all touching and romantic, so by all means celebrate with Mr. Dylan, for his times, they certainly have changed.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","classification":2}

{"text":"Drake has certainly been hyped and over-hyped as hip-hop\/rap's 'second coming'. While the accolades grow too high, Drake does have talent.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/So-Far-Gone\/dp\/B002LVAZO2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">So Far Gone<\/a>, his debut EP, showcases his talent. While not perfect, there is nothing truly bad on this EP. The biggest flaw one wonders is why couldn't the MC just have recorded a few more songs and penned this his debut album? At 33 minutes, would 40 or 45 minutes have been that much harder? Perhaps fear of more filler than substance pervaded the MC's mind and he opted for the EP.  Unfortunately for Yung Berg, who released an EP prior to his full length, his album bombed after his rushed EP&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Almost-Famous-EP\/dp\/B000R7I3S2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Almost Famous EP<\/a>&nbsp;was released (and also bombed).  While Drake's showing is much better (73,000 in its first week) and with the advantage of being more consistent that Yung Berg could've ever hoped, Drakes album should still be anticipated - possibly more so after the showing of SO FAR GONE.\n\nThe album deceptively opens up with the slightly awkward, \"Houstonlantavegas\", a song that finds the MC singing.  While it isn't a bad listen, it is a bit awkward, and definitely doesn't ring as a 'hit'.  It isn't a miss per say, but it doesn't necessary bode nearly as well as singles, following tracks \"Successful\" (feat. Trey Songz & Lil Wayne) or the more ubiquitous \"Best I Ever Had\".  Following those fine tracks, \"Uptown\" features an energized Drake accompanied by rap veteran Bun B, who has a strong verse here.  \"I'm Going In\" proves to be the 'promotional' track for Drake's forthcoming full-length effort, showing Drake 'harder' as an MC than his previous singles. Lil Wayne's appearance at the front of the track showcases that \"I'm Going In\" is no \"Best I Ever Had\" repeat;  Young Jeezy later affirms this with his verse.\n\nBoth \"The Calm\" and \"Fear\" are solid with the \"Fear\" sounding like it could have easily appeared on a Common album as opposed to Drake's debut.  Essentially, the seven-song set is very strong, save for \"Houstonlantavegas\", which isn't bad. It does build anticipation for the full length, but again, the question is asked why wasn't his made into the full-length debut? 4 stars, nonetheless.","classification":4}

{"text":"This release is from a show recorded on Friday December 12, 1969 at a place that was briefly called the Thelma which little is known about. It was located on the Sunset Strip near the Whiskey. I knew someone up until about 8 months ago who caught the band quite a few times between 1966 and 1972 in the area and he couldn't remember the place (hey Gary H. if you read this). This was the third show in a three night stand with Steve Stills showing up at the first show on the 10th. Various parts of these shows have shown up in trading circles for decades. Even odder is that while some of the songs on the audience versions match the soundboard versions, others do not.\n\nAs for this show itself, the first 45 minutes were missing from the vault for many years although a passable version turned up in trader's circles a few years back. The show opens with a grooving Cold, Rain and Snow and a rocking Me And My Uncle. Both Easy Wind and Next Time You See Me are taken at a slow pace with Pig and Jerry singing harmony on Next Time. There are great early versions of newer songs like Black Peter, Dire Wolf, High Time, Casey Jones and the newish combo of China Cat Sunflower>I Know You Rider mixed in with older songs like He Was A Friend Of Mine. The show is brought to a screeching finale with a massive jam of Alligator>Caution>Feedback>We Bid You Goodnight. If you were fortunate enough to get the bonus disc subscription, then you have massive versions of Dark Star>Saint Stephen>The Eleven>Cumberland Blues and That's It For The Other One>Cosmic Charlie. If you missed that, head over to a torrent site and download the circulating copy of that show!","classification":5}
{"text":"This is Cher's latest offering, first released in the UK and Canada in late 2001, and in the US in early 2002. UK and Canada had \"The Music's No Good Without You\" as a first single, whereas the US had \"A Song For The Lonely\" as the first single. LIVING PROOF continues the trend started by BELIEVE, her comeback album. \"A Song For The Lonely\" has a very upbeat message in it, many have used it to cope with the tragedies of 9-11, it's a universal song of acceptance that we've come to expect from Cher. There are other songs in this vein as well, \"Alive Again\" sort of mirrors the message of \"Believe\", just a song about survival and the desire to feel alive again. I really like \"Real Love\" which has a almost retro sound to it. The second single in the US is \"A Different Kind of Love Song\", which is also similar to \"A Song For The Lonely\", just a song of acceptance. She continues the trend with electronica. \"You Take It All\" is another highlight here. Other highlights include \"Rain, Rain\", and \"Love Is Lonely Place Without You\". The only songs I didn't care for were the Diane Warren penned \"Body to Body, Heart To Heart\" and the song \"When The Money's Gone\". Overall another strong album, nothing different but it should satisfy most fans.","classification":4}
{"text":"This is coming from an object reviewer and not a one direction super fan who thinks that every single song by them is amazing.\n\nFor me, this song was a complete miss. One Direction definitely has more potential than this song shows. The lyrics are unexciting and uninspiring. I feel like I have heard them a million times. It all just felt so unoriginal. I also did not like the general rhythm and sound of the song. I really do not think that this song should have been released as a single.","classification":2}

{"text":"What is better than listening to Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt or Emmylou Harris sing? Hearing them all blend their glorious voices together. And they do it royally on this the third installment of their trio albums: Twenty cuts are included on this third CD, along with numbers 1 (1987) and 2 (1999). Several selections are alternate takes of the two previous recordings, but at least half of them have not been released before. The final harvest is a rich one: Waltz Across Texas Tonight, Softly and Tenderly, Farther Along, Mr. Sandman, Wildflowers, My Dear Companion, Making Plans, Grey Funnel Line, etc.. Then there is that jewel written by Doyle Lawson, Charlie Waller  and Robert Yates Calling My Children Home. That song alone is worth the price of this reasonably priced three CD pack. This remains one of my favorite bluegrass songs ever. I have Emmy singing it solo, Garrison Keillor and the Hopeful Gospel Quartets version and the Country Gentlemans (that was once Lawson and Wallers group) rendition. My vote for best arrangement will always be the one by the San Francisco group Chanticleer. This a cappella group of twelve men do something magic with this song for almost seven ethereal minutes. The trios version (a cappella of course) certainly is a close second.\n\nThe pack has a lot of photos of the three women together and single, both as adults and from their childhoods. Also included are comments on the music by Dolly, Emmylou and Linda along with others. I never tire of listening to these women perfectly blend their heavenly voices. They are a perfect example that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.","classification":5}

{"text":"Jessica Simpson has released a fine album of holiday music; she is in great shape throughout, singing very well as she never misses a beat! She is in top form here, with sophisticated phrasing, excellent timing and diction--and her vocals are front and center as they should be! The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is very nicely done.\n\n\"My Only Wish\" starts the track set off with a tune that has lots of energy and Jessica sings this as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing--but of course we know it really isn't all that easy; Jessica's talent carries her through! The medley entitled \"Here Comes Santa Claus \/ Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\" is relentlessly upbeat and the somewhat country flavor of the musical arrangement enhances the medley even more--excellent! \"O Come O Come Emmanuel\" has Jessica delivering this with great sensitivity; and that's grand. She sings this straight from her heart and the piano arrangement adds to the song to make it really special.\n\n\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" has Jessica doing some nice work with John Britt; and that percussion makes the number fine along with her excellent singing; Jessica Simpson delivers a fine interpretation of this classic ballad. \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" has Jessica playing with the tempo ever so slightly to put her own stamp on this song. In addition, \"Mary Did You Know\" stuns me with its beauty.\n\n\"Merry Christmas Baby\" has Jessica doing fine work with Willie Nelson; and it all holds its own very well. They sound terrific together and it's a highlight of the album to be sure! \"Kiss Me for Christmas\" is very well done; and \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" is smooth and beautiful in Jessica's capable hands. \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" also sports a somewhat jazzy flavor to it and that works very well to make it strong! The album then has Jessica performing \"Carol of the Bells\" flawlessly before going into two excellent, bonus hidden tracks, \"Jingle Bell Rock\" with some mighty fine percussion, piano and guitar work and \"Silent Night\" which uses the strings to great advantage.\n\nIf you're looking for a high quality control album of holiday music, then this is a fine album for you! In addition, Jessica Simpson fans would do well to add this to their collections.","classification":5}
{"text":"I like having a variety of music available to me, so I was very happy to find this very economical collection of 30 patriotic and other songs that relate to the holiday.\n\nThe best thing you can do is to decide for yourself.

(If you are a prime member, you can listen to some of them for free in their totality, but not with the numbers on the left.)\n\nI highly recommend this album of great music to you.\n\nJohn","classification":5}

{"text":"I like this 3 disc CD\/DVD set more than when I saw them on this 2011 tour, and much more than their '08 tour recording&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Returns\/dp\/B001GSV3DS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Returns<\/a>. The song selection is great as is the interplay between the band. Perhaps it's having Ponty on board that makes it so special (adding so much more than a guitar or keyboard could), but the fusion of the band as a whole, and the times when they step out individually, is a real treat - Corea is wonderful as a leader, able to sustain the music without dominating it, White is like this too, providing a solid foundation on drums without apparently a lot of ego (and did a great job as overall producer), Gambale is very fine on guitars (I was especially impressed seeing him live, nimble and versatile), and last but surely not least, Clarke is a real force of nature on his basses.\n\nFor me the whole production flows smoothly and easily with a few highlights being the longer \"The Shadow of Lo\/Sorceress\" and \"The Romantic Warrior\". Like a fine old Bordeaux, which has just gotten finer with age, this is consummate music made by consummate musicians. The bonus documentary is exactly that a real bonus - including an hour plus high quality documentary of the tour, almost 40 minutes of additional live concert footage, and a condensed movie trailer. It all makes for a highly recommended set for fans of the band and genre.","classification":5}
{"text":"G1C's fourth album displays a lot of change with the group. The departure of Pablo has caused a mellowing of the hip-hop that dominated verses of previous G1C's past albums and has given Blanca a chance to step up and become more of a central part of the duo's sound. Manwell holds down the fort with his hip-hop rhymes and the beats are as fresh and fun as always. I also think this album is a step-up lyrically and reflects the enduring spirit the Lord has given these two during this transitional time. I like Fearless a lot and think that G1C is coming into their own and finding their unique identity. Highly recommended for exercising, parties, and just cruising in the car.","classification":5}

{"text":"4th studio album from band out of Glasgow, Scotland--grand, epic, powerhouse stadium rock\n  that packs a gripping reach-for-the-sky ethos.  The songs have a distinct sense of size:  these\n  are BIG-scope tunes with a building, driving force that uses taut emotional spaciousness to\n  inspire and compel.  Listening gives you a sense of power and fulfillment, as though something\n  important just happened and you were part of it.  The instruments are sweeping, soaring,\n  engulfing; and although the sound can be a bit formulaic at times, it is never boring.\n  Occasionally, the simplicity of updated Celtic folk music creeps into the expansive mix.  For all of\n  its grandiose intention and massive (but not overblown) production, the album never sacrifices\n  the integrity of intimacy, largely due to Scott Hutchison's rivetingly personal, potent Scottish\n  brogue vocals.  Reminiscent of the Twilight Sad, Airborne Toxic Event, the John Knox Sex Club,\n  U2, Arcade Fire.  If you like your sound served with unapologetically majestic muscle and\n  dramatic, far-reaching style in huge portions, this will satisfy your hunger.  My plate is empty,\n  and I'm smiling.","classification":5}

{"text":"It's not surprising that, what with her previous BELIEVE being such a monster, that eternal pop icon Cher would follow-up that set with another disc of like-minded material. What may be surprising is that she's managed to pick out an album's worth--well,almost--of songs that hold the listeners interest,something she failed to achieve with the mostly half-baked BELIEVE(the obvious exceptions being the title track and 'All Or Nothing'). Which is a shame,because,like her magnificently underappreciated IT'S A MAN'S WORLD, LIVING PROOF looks to be losing what little momentum it managed to garner from BELIEVE's success, going the way of WORLD with little to no fanfare. It's even more disheartening considering that the song and vocal quality is literally light years ahead of her previous set, thanks to such first-rate tracks as 'Song For The Lonely','Alive Again','A Different Kind Of Love Song', and 'Love Is A Lonely Place Without You'. The only real snoozer here is 'Body to Body,Heart to Heart'(Memo to artist--cross Diane Warren off your \"go to\" list--she hasn't written anything remotely interesting in ages). The only other quibble is the over-use of that annoying vocoder--it was cool on 'Believe'(the first half a million times),but it's used far too much for it's own good here. Otherwise,LIVING PROOF stands as one of the artist's most consistent collections.","classification":4}

{"text":"14th studio album from this legendary Australian musician, one of the few true artists of our time.\n  Much like Leonard Cohen, if Cave is an artist you have discovered, he will always be close to\n  your soul (though sometimes on the dark side), because he has something to say and he knows\n  how to say it so that it matters.  \"Push the Sky Away\" is not his best album or his worst.  It rings\n  true with the power of the band's artistic integrity and, as usual, that is enough to satisfy, enough\n  to make most other releases pale in comparison.  The songs lean toward the mellow, gentler\n  gospel\/folk side; but Cave's crooning, intensely personal & dramatic vocal delivery crawls\n  through his dark, poetic lyrical imagery with vehement, loving passion and a riveting interpretive\n  flair.  The Bad Seeds are veteran players who believe in and understand his ability, and their\n  instrumental contribution is both essential and subtly spectacular.  His albums always grow on\n  you, and this is no exception.  Members have played in Grinderman, Dirty Three, the Triffids,\n  Magazine, Buzzcocks, Visage, etc.  Expect to fall slowly, irreversibly in love with the depth and\n  purity that lies waiting here.","classification":4}

{"text":"Right along with NKOTB and Debbie Giobson, Tiffany dominated the late 80's with pleasent teen pop tunes. Although her fame only lasted about 2 years, she still managed a lot in that time period. Tiffany's debut album went 4x platinum *quite an accomplishment back then* and yielded two #1 singles. \"I Think We're Alone Now\" *the remake of the 60's pop tune* was just about perfect and Tiffany sounded great on it. \"Could've Been\" was the other #1 and I rank it as one of the best ballads of the 80's. Tiffany pulls it off wonderfully. She also pulled off another top 10 hit from her debut \"I Saw Him Standing There\" which is also represented on here along with a minor hit \"Feelings of Forever.\" Then in 1988, Tiffany released her sophomore album \"Hold An Old Friend's Hand.\" The album wasn't as successful as her debut, but it was by no means a flop. It went platinum and gave Tiffany the top 10 hit \"All This Time\" which is right up there with \"Could've Been.\" \"Radio Romance\" was also a hit cracking the top 40.\nIt may not be right calling this a \"Greatest Hits\" seeing as how many of the songs were never hits, but even the non-hits are fairly good. \"Danny\" is a nice piece of ear candy and so is \"Hold An Old Friend's Hand.\" They both fit in well with the distinguished singles. Although Tiffany didn't have the hits like other teen pop acts such as Debbie Gibson or the Backstreet Boys or even NKOTB, but she still had an incredible voice and this collection shows that she really was talented for her age.","classification":4}

{"text":"Honestly, I should have done this review a while ago, but then again, considering the fact that I now have over 800 CDs worth of music (and counting), combined with how busy I am between work, home life and friends, I have had time for only so many reviews - that is, relatively. Anyways, having been a fan of heavy metal music, both great classic metal like this from the `80s and modern underground metal of today, I think I should have owned this album much sooner. I received my first ever true metal album, Metallica's Kill `Em All, when I was about 15 years old, and was completely blown away. Given that, I find it almost stupid that I did not own this album by the mighty and legendary Iron Maiden until I was 24!\n\nAlthough this album has been criticized for its use of guitar synthesizers on some of the songs, I really do not have any issue with it whatsoever. I find every song on this album to be mind-blowingly epic in every sense of the word on every imaginable level. With almost every song exceeding five minutes in length, it demonstrates the sheer passion, emotion, complexity and technicality for which true classic metal such as this is known. After all, there is a reason Iron Maiden are considered one of the most important contributors to the development of what some people call \"metal as we know it\" and I could not agree more. Bruce Dickinson's high-flying voice, Adrian Smith's mighty guitar solos, Nicko McBrian's insane drumming, plus so much more... honestly, what more can any Maiden fan want?\n\nMy personal favorites on this album (even though I do love every song on the album from beginning to end):\n\n\"Caught Somewhere In Time\"\n\"Wasted Years\"\n\"Heaven Can Wait\"\n\"Alexander the Great\"\n\nThis album, for obvious reasons, is one of my all-time favorite metal albums from the `80s, hands down. It has turned out to be one of my favorite albums to work out to at my local gym, especially whenever I go for extended runs on the elliptical machines or treadmills; is really helps one to get their legs moving and ticking that calorie counter up higher and higher! Honestly, and needless to say, it is the definition of classic `80s metal, no questions asked.\n\nWhat I also want to point out is that if not for Iron Maiden, NONE of the following bands would exist:\n\nMetallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Overkill, Annihilator, Testament, Blind Guardian, Gamma Ray, Helloween, Stratovarius, Firewind, Hammerfall, Kamelot, Primal Fear, Rhapsody of Fire, Sonata Arctica, Theocracy, Thunderstone, Dream Theater, Symphony X, Mindwarp Chamber, Royal Hunt, Seventh Wonder, Voyager, Nightwish, Xandria... honestly, there are WAY too many to list!\n\nOverall, if you consider yourself a true metalhead, then it makes absolutely NO SENSE for you not to own this album. It has what every metalhead could ask for. Most importantly, as I have said this on a number of my other reviews on a variety of other musicians\/bands\/artists, epic music like this never gets old. NEVER. It is not old, it is timeless. Anyone who thinks otherwise, and who would say things like \"Get with the times!\" really could use a good psychological examination. Do not ever listen to troll reviewers like Jonas Brothers #1 Fan or Cincinnati Bengals Lover. They are a waste of time and space, and clearly do not know anything about anything. Iron Maiden easily crush the living daylights out of Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Fall Out Boy, or anyone else those trolls say is good.\n\nALL HAIL THE MIGHTY IRON MAIDEN!!! FOR NOW AND FOR ALL OF ENTERNITY!!! UP THE IRONS!!! \\M\/\\M\/","classification":5}

{"text":"No REALLY, I'm serious. My wife doesn't get it. My friends don't get it. My family doesn't get it. But I think some other people who listened to and love this CD get it. This is not just another album. Taylor Swift, somewhere along the line, went from just another Country Music Generic Girl to a song-writing GENIUS. Maybe she grew up. Maybe she got her 10 years\/10,000 hours ala Mozart. I don't know. But all I know is something CHANGED in that woman. Her music was good before. Not mostly my cup of tea (except a few songs from Fearless), but good. Then I heard snippets from some of the songs in Red in various commercials for Cola and Stores. I got curious. I decided to check out at the album at my local library...\n\nOMG\n\nYeah, yeah. Young kids love Taylor Swift. My hipster friends like to make fun of her. I'm a 36-year-old male. Not my demographic. Blah, blah, blah. I mostly listen to video game music, film scores, and orchestral recording. When I DO listen to music with lyrics I like to listen to every kind of music under the sun (country, pop, easy-listening, classic rock, 80's, 90's, metal, joke albums, folk music, etc). So when I say that music is genius, I'm saying this after a lifetime of love of every kind of music from classical to broadway to radio. And this album is undoubtedly genius.\n\nEvery song...EVERY SONG\n\nLet's be honest. Most albums released have one or two great songs that deserve to be hits, and the rest are kinda forgettable. Rare is the album that you want to put in your cd player or record player and listen to beginning to end (which is why retro records are such a huge deal these days IMO; people like the old albums that told a great story over the course of an album). But boy is this ever an album to listen to all-the-way through. The beat, rhythm, pacing, lyrics, vocals, instrumentation, is just...perfect is not the word. These songs are written, performed, and perfected by a GENIUS. Yeah, yeah. Auto-tune is a thing. Voices can be adjusted in the studio to improve them. So....what? The end product is what matters on an album, and the end product here is extraordinary.\n\nYou see all the influences here. Some of the songs are reminiscent of U2, Mandy Moore, Michelle Branch, Cher, and all your favorite Pop music. But there's a quickness, a flexibility, and vivacious enthusiasm and genuine emotion that is Taylor Swift, and it is straining to escape in every track, like she's got something she desperately needs to tell you and can barely hold it in. Perhaps that's why I love this album so much. I have Aspergers. I can't feel empathy from people around me in the real world. So I love \"anvil-dropping\" emotion. I love to know clearly and obviously how someone feels (in a video game, a TV show, a movie, a book, and especially in music). And in this album Taylor wears her emotions on her sleeve and the melodrama is glorious. And the lyrics are brilliant.\n\nI don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22\n\nI cannot for the life of me understand why my wife and her friends do not love the song \"22\" to death, except perhaps as Taylor is very much aware, it's \"cool\" to hate her, and hipster music \"is so much cooler than me\". To that, all I can say is...it's not easy to be number 1. It's not easy to be at the top of the world (only place to do is down). As Dale Carnegie pointed out in his books, all the other kids want to \"kick the king\" (true story). And in my mind's eye I can imagine Taylor Swift walking off stage at a massive concert full of screaming fans and having a sobbing breakdown like the gold medalist from the film \"Chariots of Fire\" when another competitor says \"what's wrong with him?\" and a man replies \"It's a terrible thing to win. Hope you never have to experience it.\"\n\nYes, Taylor is well-aware that she's loved and hated. And uses it to add fuel to her creative fire. And with \"22\" she used it to create the anthem of a generation. That's not the only case of brilliant lyrics, but it is perhaps the most obvious. Her lyrics are like poems. And they are GOOD.\n\nIs this Taylor Swift's Greatest Album? I don't know. Maybe. It fuses country\/pop\/and R&B rhythms better than any of her other albums, which went more in the pop\/rap\/ballad direction. But it is definitely worth owning, on a number of levels. It's a milestone in terms of country\/pop fusion. It's one of Taylor Swift's best albums, and it marks in my mind the turning point where her music went from good to BRILLIANT. Buy it. Ya know, unless Taylor Swift's annoying voice and \"uncoolness\" is too much for you. Whatever.","classification":5}

{"text":"Controlled chaos.\n\nThat might be the best way to describe the Arcade Fire and their new release, the Suburbs.\n\nMost, if not all, the Montreal based septet are multi-instrumentalists and take some part in the writing of each song, though Win Butler does most of the writing\/heavy lifting. But Arcade Fire is creative in ways of arrangements and mixing instruments like no other band.\n\nThe Suburbs is longer than their first two disks - over an hour of music. It is seemingly more of a combination of their debut Funeral and its follow-up Neon Bible than it is a departure. The jury is still out (with me) as if it is better than Neon Bible, let alone what I would consider the best disk of 2010.\n\nThough not billed as a \"concept album\", one might take it that way if so chosen.\n\nI can't help thinking that some of the disk is out of sequence if this were a concept disk. The excellent \"Wasted Hours\" would be right at the front of the playlist (\"first they built the roads; then they built the town\"). Then the disk could have kicked into \"Ready to Start\" - and it does kick.\n\nWith \"Ready to Start\", sometimes it seems this is the song with most energy, passion and sincerity. (\"if I was yours, but I'm not\" or \"I would rather be alone; than pretend I feel alright\", but then conversely Butler sings: \"but to bow down to them anyway; is better than to be alone\".) Yes, life is the suburbs is no picnic.\n\nThat song really is the killer track on this disk. I have played it dozens of times and am really into it. But I think AF does a great job on \"Rocco\", \"Modern Man\", \"City with No Children\", \"Suburban War\" and \"We Used to Wait\". The latter song takes a while to kind of get going. Hell, the first half of it is two piano keys, but I'm really digging it.\n\nI also like both \"Sprawl I (Flatlands)\" and \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\". Ditto with \"Half Light\" I and II.\n\nI'll be honest, I was not much of a fan of Rgine Chassagne. But for her work on this disk, I'm at least enjoying: \"Sprawl II\" works, as does \"Empty Room\" \"Half Light\" Maybe on the latter tracks (I and II), she does more singing with Butler. Her songs here are somewhat reminiscent of \"In the Backseat\" from Funeral. I didn't like anything she did on Neon Bible.\n\nI want to like the title tracks more. I like the lyrics and the melody enough, but the Joplin-esque piano drives me to distraction. The reprise is somewhat throwaway, yet necessary almost to end the disk.\n\n\"Month of May\" starts out incredibly strong, until vocals are put into the mix. I was so excited when it started, but it is hard to sit through for me. But for all their mania, there are a number of slower songs, which while they existed on other disks, they did not seem as sparse.\n\nYes, there is a lot going on with the Suburbs, but the same can be said for all their disks. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. I saw their live-stream Madison Square Garden set and much of this works better live than on album.\n\nMy current conclusion (always subject to change with further listenings), is that it's a very good disk, but right now, not great. Neon Bible struck me more from the first listen and three years later has held me there. We'll see if the Suburbs does the same thing.","classification":4}

Ghost drops in on the first track and that's the best one on the album (4 In Da Morning). I think the direction for this album is needed. Its not raw and gritty like his previous work so I think this may appeal to more newcomers and tap into a new market. Good production, short album and a decent body of work.

He once commented; \"I seem to have more fans young enough to be my grandchildren lately than I do ones my own age.\" So why is he getting stuck in a duets rut, one that Sinatra knew enough to see as a novelty thing with an end point after his two albums? Consider this review to be an \"amen\" to several customers here. It ain't about the material. It aint about the choice of partners or the job they did. But when you're in a position of regaining some form of stardom when everybody else your age is either six feet under or an anachronism, stunts that make potential fans say \"BFD\" seems a way of \"steppin' out\" all the way out. And you wind up doing gigs on cruise ships while your classics end up on $4.99 Wal Mart budget CDs.","classification":3}

{"text":"Emmy Lou Harris' latest CD, along with Rodney Crowell, is a great one to listen to after you've seen the movie \"Quartet,\" as they both speak to  those of us who may well be past the Septembers of our lives. No teenage angst here. First of all, the photographs of this duo by David  McClister are in a word wonderful. Harris gets more beautiful each year and should make every middle-aged woman want to go grey. And the producers included the words to the twelve songs  on the CD, something that seems to happen less and less these days.\n\nMr. Crowell wrote several of the selections, as did Hank DeVito. \"Invitation to the Blues\" by Roger Miller is included as is Kris Kristofferson's \"Chase the Feeling.\" Many of the songs are about  love, loss, yesterdays, looking back at life-- in short songs for contemplative adults. There is a lot of great music here, but I particularly like Crowell's  \"Open Season  On My Heart\" and \"Here We Are.\" The song that crowds all the others out, however, and that I listen to over and over-- it's worth the price of the CD-- is \"Back When We Were Beautiful\" by Matraca Berg-- an anthem to a young and perfect love. Here is the song in its entirety.\n\nI guess you had to be there, she said, you had to be\nShe handed me a yellowed  photograph\nAnd then said, see\nThis was my greatest love, my one and only love\nAnd this is me\nBack when we were beautiful see\n\nI don't feel very different, she said, I know it's strange\nI guess I've gotten used to these little aches and pains\nBut I still love to dance, you know we used to dance\nThe night away\nBack when we were beautiful, beautiful, yes\n\nI hate it when they say\nI'm aging gracefully\nI fight it every day\nI guess they never see\nI don't like this at all\nWhat's happening to me\n\nBut I really love my grandkids, she said, they've sweet to hold\nThey would have loved their grandpa\nThose awful jokes he told\nYou know sometimes for a laugh, the two of us would act\nLike we were old\nBack when we were beautiful, beautiful\nBeautiful, beautiful, yes\n\nBut I guess you had to be there. . .\n\n\"Old Yellow Moon\" is Mr. Harris' best CD in a long time-- I don't know enough about Mr. Crowell's music to have an opinion about him-- I just know that this one is going to get played a lot by me.\n\nHighly recommended.","classification":5}

My favorite being \"Autumn Leaves.\" Bob's no Frank, but I like the effort.","classification":4}
{"text":"Clint Black arrived on the country charts in 1989, the same year Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson, and Travis Tritt released debut albums.  Black's Killin' Time initially established him as the biggest of the new stars, with hits like \"A Better Man,\" \"Nobody's Home,\" and the title track.\n These songs showcased Black's clever wordplay amid fairly traditional honky tonk arrangements and a Haggardesque vocal style. While it wasn't long before Black was surpassed commercially by Brooks and Jackson, his music maintained a high standard during his RCA tenure that was highlighted by 29 top ten hits.\n Black's two Greatest Hits volumes were both frustrating affairs whose new material - aside from the haunting chart-topper \"Like The Rain\" - was subpar.  This chronologically arranged, 20-track collection concentrates on his biggest chart hits, including the lush \"Loving Blind\" and the heartbreaking \"Where Are You Now\" (number ones inexplicably left off those other sets).\n The only non-single found here is the jazzy Bruce Hornsby duet \"Dixie Lullaby.\"  As it sounds a lot like the enclosed Steve Wariner pairing \"Been There\" (which it precedes), its selection is suspect.  Had the compilers included \"When I Said I Do\" - Black's award winning, # 1 collaboration with wife Lisa Hartman - instead, this retrospective might have merited its Ultimate title.","classification":5}

{"text":"This is still the lushest of all the Bee Gees' albums, unless you count the late, great CUCUMBER CASTLE.  That alone makes it worth hearing a few hundred times but my, oh my- -those songs.  I don't know what the rift was over the band's direction that temporarily broke them up (a family affair, you see), but whatever it was the Brothers rose above the occasion and created one of the finest records of the glorious, inglorious Sixties.  It was their last of that decade, and everything they'd done previous to it, great as it may have been, was merely prelude.  In England ODESSA was released as a red-velvet two-LP box set; in the States as a red-velvet double LP with a remarkably green disaster-at-sea insert.  You could put the thing on your coffee table (or floor, or kitchen counter) and let it speak for itself, or you could lie back and immerse yourself in its velvety sonic ocean.  Or both, with or without headphones.  Okay, that may be overstating it, but ODESSA contains some of the Brothers' finest compositions, ranging from the story-telling prog-rock of the title track (the cello solo is an ingenious touch) to the lighter-than-air, lovely 'Melody Fair' to the oboe-chugged, acoustic 'Suddenly' (Maurice was always the underappreciated contributor) to the desperately haunted 'Sound Of Love'.  Heck, they even included an international anthem that actually sounds like one, the prescient globalists!!  And two other orchestral instrumentals to boot!  And- -'Lamplight'!! You want goofy instead?  Okay, 'Give Your Best', and 'Never Say Never Again'! There! These guys are awesome!

{"text":"Consider the opening 0:51 of War Pigs. It explodes like a bomb hitting the ground in one of those WWII aerial films - simultaneous heavy guitar, bass and cymbal crash. While the chord sustains, a few more bombs are seen falling beneath us, through a grey sky towards a black and white city below. Listen to the guitar at 0:07, this kind of hammered-on note an octave above the root. It is like the sudden moment of impact, with the waves of destruction rippling outward. Away to the west, tanks crawl slowly across farm fields, prepared to blow away anything in their way. At 0:31 a warning siren in a nearby town calls for everyone to evacuate.\n\nAt 0:52 the pace quickens with sharp stabbing chords and pulse-quickening hi-hat. Ozzy Osbourne begins to sing at 1:03:\n\nGenerals gathered in their masses\nJust like witches at black masses (or my preference, 'smell each other's stinky asses')\n\nI like the double meaning of 'mass'. Similar to 'please please me' by The Beatles. The rest of Geezer Butler's lyrics are good, and it's a great anti-war song but, you know what? I've never liked Ozzy's voice all that much. That's all I'm going to say about it.\n\nTony Iommi plays fantastic guitar throughout: those triplets at 1:29, the trill at 1:34, the descending chords at 1:48, the little bend at 1:50, the chug and slash part from 2:08-2:17 and the riffs that accompany Politicians hide themselves away. Beginning at 3:30 he plays several solos that overlap until around 4:20. I love those pitch bends from 4:13-4:18. A very clever guitarist.\n\nBill Ward plays excellent drum fills everywhere, particularly at 1:38, 1:52, 1:57, 2:02 and on and on, through Iommi's solo, and 5:28-5:30. Geezer Butler holds it all down with his mighty bass playing.\n\nThe final 2:12 is a section called 'Luke's Wall'. It's a pretty cool way to end the song. Some great drums in this part, too. And bonus for me: no Ozzy.","classification":5}

{"text":"I tend to avoid mainstream pop music, especially the stuff aimed at tweenagers (Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, etc).  But when I make an exception, it's for a very special song -- and one such song is Rebecca Black's \"Friday.\"\n\nFew songs in my life have touched me as deeply and powerfully as this one song. This stirring, symphonic melody rises with a chorus of \"yeah-ah-ahs!\", over a stretch of gritty synth and wild beats. Black's angelic, shimmering voice lulls you with her expansive vocal range until you barely notice the subtlety and brilliance of the lyrics.\n\nOh, the lyrics. In what other pop song could you hear dazzling symbolism like \"I'm drivin', cruisin'\/fast lanes, switching lanes\"?  In what other could you hear evocative poetry like \"Yesterday was Thursday\/Today is Friday\"? In what other could you hear such a searing, scathing glimpse into the psyche of American's youth, such as \"Gotta make my mind up\/which seat can I take?\"\n\nIndeed, young genius -- which seat should you take? Clearly she is debating whether to embrace the predictable safety of suburban life (back seat) or the wild unfettered life of a true artist (front seat). IN NO OTHER SONG will you find such unabashed genius. I get woozy just thinking about it.\n\n...\n\nOkay, time to turn the sarcasm off. This song is every bit as bad as most people say it is -- a massive sonic hairball of ear-curling vocals, flaccid pop tunes and devastatingly vapid lyrics. Most tween pop is vapid, but this waves a banner with shining V-A-P-I-D letter emblazoned on it.\n\nHonestly, Black's vocals are horrible -- flat and autotuned into a droning whine, until you just want to punch your speakers to make the yowls of \"Fryyyyydaaaaayyy\" stop coming out of them. And you cannot even be distracted by the music because we just get a thin glittery blanket of tepid techno  that doesn't really even have a tune.\n\nAnd oh.... the lyrics. If you wanted to sing a song about partying on the weekend, don't bore us with descriptions of driving, eating cereal and being passed by schoolbuses. To make matters worse, Black bores us with descriptions of how Friday comes after Thursday and before Saturday, and how Saturday is right before Sunday. Is this song aimed at the Sesame Street crowd?\n\nRebecca Black's \"Friday\" is one of those transcendently horrible songs that achieves novelty status because it is JUST THAT BAD. Do not listen after eating.","classification":1}

{"text":"This is an uninspired effort by guitar luminary Warren Haynes, backed by Railroad Earth, the popular so-called \"newgrass\" band from New Jersey.  Warren Haynes is a perennial winner of Guitar Player magazine's guitarist of the year and has backed such greats as The Allman Brothers Band, The Grateful Dead, and jazz guitarist John Scofield.  He is also co-founder and frontman of the blues rock quartet, Gov't Mule.  Haynes produced this album and wrote most of the songs.  He has never particularly shone in these roles nor as a vocalist, however, and is most noted for his guitar work.\n\nThis outcome of this album is, thus, not surprising (although one might have hoped for more synergy between Haynes and Railroad Earth).  There is more acoustic instrumentation and much more of a folk-rock feel to this than his work with Gov't Mule.  Perhaps this is why he chose to be backed by Railroad Earth.  At any rate, Railroad Earth, while competent musicians, are hardly virtuosos and it feels as though Haynes is dragging them along.\n\nThe album overall has a leaden feel to it.  \"Gold Dust Woman\", the rock classic by Stevie Nicks and sung on this album by Grace Potter, utterly fails to capture the dynamism and tension of the Fleetwood Mac original.  Haynes musters some energy, however, for country classic \"Coal Tattoo\", by Billy Edd Wheeler, and his own composition, \"Beat Down the Dust\", both of which also have appealing working class political themes.","classification":2}

Though this time with added theatrical flair and the return of guitarist Dick Wagner. Cooper continued to assume new identities, such as the famed swordsman of \"Zorro's Ascent\" and the put-upon son of \"Make That Money (Scrooge's Song).\" Some of the performances seem labored, and Wagner's distinctive guitar riffs feel as if they were grafted onto the songs to add flash. The stagey ballad \"I Am the Future\" might have worked well as a production number, but with Cooper descending back into alcohol addiction there was no tour. What works well is Cooper's humor on \"No Baloney Homosapiens,\" \"I Like Girls\" and \"Remarkably Insincere.\" And on \"Tag, You're It\" he indulges his longtime love of cheesy cinema with a song full of slasher-film clichs. If there was no 1970s legacy with which to compare this, one might stumble upon this and think it's a long-lost power-pop album from a surprisingly talented lyricist. It's all quite listenable, and even fun as it passes by, but it's not nearly as memorable as his earlier (and some of his later) works.

{"text":"It was a controversial song that dramatically changed the fortunes of both the man who wrote it and the young female singer who recorded it. Before he wrote \"Harper Valley P.T.A\" Tom T. Hall had been a travelling DJ and an aspiring songwriter trying to make ends meet on about $50.00 a week. Meanwhile, Jeannie C. Riley had dreamed of being a country music star since she was a little girl. After marrying her high school sweetheart Jeannie C. pulled up her Texas stakes and headed for Nashville. Believing he had a monster hit on his hands producer Shelby Singleton Jr. bided his time waiting for just the right voice to sing this tune about small-town hypocrisy. Singleton flipped when he heard the demo recorded by Jeannie C. Riley. Riley recorded the song in just one take and Singleton pushed the song into radio stations and record stores as quickly as possible. It was an instant smash. \"Harper Valley P.T.A.\" song two million copies in just the first two weeks and wound up selling more than six million records. The single was honored by the Country Music Association as \"Single of the Year\" for 1968 while Riley won a Grammy for Country Female Vocalist of the year.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.","classification":4}

They may be wanderers, adventurers, or vagabonds.\"  Actress, Lisa Bonet from \"The Cosby Show\" and \"A Different World\" is a classic 'Bohemian.'

I said \"hi.\"  Now,  \"As I lay me down...\" is light sounding, regarding instrumentals, her voice is as soothing and soft as a flute during the song.  I was born on February 3, the Valentine's Day month.

{"text":"In my more than 30 years as a new age music journalist and reviewer, Ive seen and written about a number of albums specifically created to attune the energy centers or chakras of the body and spirit. However, God of Drum by Kari Hohne, who records under the name of Get Tribal, is certainly one of the most unique. She describes the album as a collection of percussion-based tribal music inspired by the thunder deities of world mythology. According to Kari: Each track was composed based on an archetype and shamanic drumming pattern from different parts of the world.  These reflect Native American, Celtic, Chinese, Norse, African, Mayan, and more. As can be expected, there is a broad spectrum of ethnic instruments, while her parallel interest in electronic music brings in synthesizers, samplers, and other contemporary sounds. Although meditation music is generally soft and soothing, Kari purposely sought to unlock energy.\n\nWhile there is a lot of metaphysics behind the music, and it can be helpful or interesting to know, ultimately its also fine to just press play and go with the flow. The album is a spirited multi-cultural musical experience that anyone can enjoy and groove to. But at its heart, God of Drum by Get Tribal is a powerful musical tool for unlocking energy to create harmony and balance. Her extensive research into archetypes, mythology, and shamanic studies is particularly evident in the music heard on the album. The emphasis on earthy rhythms and world music influences make this one of the most notable offerings in this particular genre. A lot of vision and creativity went into sonically designing each track, and it shows. For me, this album was a pleasant surprise, and one Id recommend in a heartbeat.","classification":5}

{"text":"A fabulous boxset. I have the 24\/96 downloads and will mostly comment on the remasterings of the albums. The CDs are downsampled from these HD versions and sound much the same.\n\nIn a word this set is: GREAT! Everything sounds more like the band overall. The mixes are still mainly what you got before, and the 70s\/80s sound on some of them is the same, but with some pretty huge differences in bass and clarity of high-frequencies. Nebraska is like a whole new album and people will be very pleased with it. DR12 to boot. The realism factor is a lot higher. The differences may be small to some but I doubt that for this specific album. An entire hazy glaze has been taken off it to reveal what might have actually been on the tapes in the first place.\n\nWhatever it was, the scan or the master tweaking, everything sounds a lot more like you would want it to sound. Realism compared to a very subdued effort on most of the old masters. The high-end finally has its due here. I see some are annoyed they are actually listening to the album as it should sound. Well, the high-end was always kind of weak on the old masters imo. The albums definitely pop out at you more from their muddled beginnings, but this is how instruments sound.\n\nAlmost all of the old CDs are just not up to par with these new masters and the technology used to produce them. The dynamic ranges are mostly the same or near to the old releases, except in extenuating instances where they were clearly trying to clean up the sound without having access to full remixes of the material. No, these don't sound as fresh as something like King Crimson's 40th remixes, but then again they do benefit oh so much from new scanning technology first and foremost imo.\n\nMany of the releases just seem like they had had an ever so slight veil lifted from them, and you can now hear the instruments as they should be heard. Born to Run is not too different from its 30th Anniversary master, but the bass is definitely bigger, and yes this record can be a little loud. It is the loudest of them all at DR8. You hear drums and basslines a lot more prominent and I am sure they were going for this stadium sound, which is true to the intent of the record. Not really a headphone record. This album was always kind of strange sounding to begin with, too.\n\nSeparation is also improved as some have noted. Those early version masters were altogether not suited for the more complex of Bruce's albums, and you can tell the old scans were not picking everything up. Ludwig and Co. did a great job here with keeping the mixes alive without harming the dynamics. Most albums are DR9-DR12 and they sound true to source to me.\n\nBorn to Run and maybe some poorer mixes go to DR7 to DR9 and sound altogether pretty great and better than I have ever heard them for sure. Usually, a mix has a lesser DR rating when they have problems getting the sound they want, at least when professional engineers like Ludwig are involved. Born in the USA is mostly DR8-9 but has a DR11 and DR10 track as well so you know they paid attention to the entire process and went with what the track needed. It could be a little hot if you are just listening in headphones.\n\nNebraska sounds like a jewel still and is DR12, as are the early albums in that range. Anyone really complaining about loudness in this boxset is fairly mistaken. They are loud but I'm not hearing anything bad per se, and most of them have plenty of range.\n\nI think that people whining about compression need to realize a few things. Even Pink Floyd, who remastered their albums with very high values from DR 10-15, used DR8 for some of their older, poorer sounding albums. Compression is NOT a one way street here people. You NEED compression for everything in small amounts. I am sure they chose to go that route with Born to Run as it has always sounded kind of bad. Some mixes need more bass and overall compression to bring out details. Of course you can go overboard but I don't really see any of that here. Many of the albums are DR9-11 like Darkness and River. Literally nothing to complain about using the best tools in the audio industry! I think more or less people may need to upgrade their sound systems for than anything.\n\nThe packaging actually is pretty good for this set if not spectacular. I have seen it in the hands of a friend and the asking price does not seem too much atm. I would not pay 100 dollars for this obviously so I guess some people may be angry about that. A nice booklet and art complement an important package in music history. Nothing super special but... for say 60 dollars it is a nice set to have.","classification":5}

{"text":"Pink Floyd are so much more than just a band.  Like the Beatles, they were an institution in world music culture, incredibly unique and bridged a musical world that drew equal influence from blues, some classical music, jazz, psychedelic and industrial to create the cherished Pink Floyd \"sound\", beautiful, alien, trippy, and psychotic.\n  After the departure of Roger Waters, Dave Gilmour became the de facto leader of the group, and being of a more sedate fellow, the last two Pink Floyd albums were much classier and lacked the paranoia of Waters' contributions.  It was after \"The Division Bell\" that Floyd more or less called it a day, with Gilmour releasing a couple solo albums, including the beautiful \"Blue\" and even dusting off his rock and roll chops with Paul McCartney and Mick Green on McCartney's \"Run Devil Run\".\n  \"The Endless River\" is the tail end of \"The Division Bell\" era, with Nick Mason and David Gilmour going back and reviewing tracks recorded with the late Rick Wright, adding some bits and pieces, and releasing a nearly all instrumental album, with only one vocal track at the very end.\n  What we get is an amalgam of what made Pink Floyd special, but much more \"adult\" and contemporary, if you will.  While there are some references to triumphs past, it's a laid back classy CD that doesn't recall \"The Wall\" at all, and shows us a rare side, the jamming that eventually became song snippets pieced together for a single whole.  It works wonderfully, Wright's ethereal keyboards always creeping around your subconsciousness, Mason's tasteful drumming and Gilmour's understated gorgeous guitar work that is all melody and no chaff.  It's the mellowest Floyd since \"Meddle\" and gives us clues where David Gilmour would go when he released \"Blue\".  Nobody ever did Pink Floyd music better than Pink Floyd, though the bands that tried are probably countless.","classification":5}

{"text":"In 2011, Joss Stone collaborated with A.R. Rahman, Mick Jagger, Dave Stewart, and Damien Marley on the ambitious supergroup SuperHeavy, after which Marley convinced her to record a reggae album. The result is \"Water For Your Soul\".\n\nThe music is calming and pleasant, with Stone rarely venturing into her belting range. The lilting \"Love Me\" opens the album and sets the tone for much of the album. \"Cut The Line\" is reggae with a retro soul groove. \"You can't complain when you're shutting me out\" she sings. \"Wake Up\" has a hip hop lilt to it. Other standouts are \"Molly Town\", the horn-peppered \"Harry's Symphony\" (with some spoken word by Linton Kwesi Johnson, and a bit nicked from Inner Circle's \"Bad Boys\"), \"Clean Water\" (with a lovely guitar intro), and the skittery \"The Answer\" which has an African feel to it.\n\nNot everything is reggae though. \"This Ain't Love\" is a bluesy groove. \"Stuck On You\" is a sultry acoustic affair. The funky \"Let Me Breathe\" is adorned with enchanting Spanish guitar. The album highlight has got to be children's chorus-adorned \"Star\", an indescribably beautiful unhurried groove. \"It don't matter what car you drive, or whatever sound you like, it don't matter if you're praying to God, or trust in Mother Nature... We are who we are...\" go the lyrics of self belief.\n\nNot everything works (the Jamaican patois on some songs, and \"Sensimilla\" anyone?), and fans of her supersonic belting will come away short changed, but I love it when an artist experiments and stretches their talent. Another classy addition to the Stone collection.","classification":4}

Fortunately for me, I never cared about race, so I made friends of every color, and was able to broadly expand my horizons on the music front. I've never really cared for R&B, and still don't.  But some Rap, and Funk, really hit the spot. Earth, Wind, and Fire, was one of those funk bands. I LOVE Funk\/Disco! Even my family hears me listen to EWF, and says \"Hey! That is really good! Who is that?!\" But, of course when I say \"EWF\" they say \"Oh, It's alright\". I KNOW THEY CAN FEEL THE FUNK!!!!!! They know it is great! EWF is probably my favorite, when it comes to funk!

{"text":"It's 21 years since Shawn's last album of covers - the wonderful 'Cover Girl' and that album's producer Steuart Smith returns to produce this record, along with Stewart Lerman. Featured are covers of songs by great song-writers such as Paul Simon, John Fogerty, Bruce Springsteen, Gerry Rafferty, Tom Waits and Stevie Wonder and the instrumentation is very stripped down - mainly acoustic guitar and excellent pedal steel (Milo Deering), with occasional additional guitar\/mandolin, restrained bass and percussion. These are obviously favourite songs for Shawn, some quite famous, like Gerry Rafferty's \"Baker Street\" others less so - I've heard her doing Crowded House songs in concert and she covers their \"Private Universe\" here.\n\nWe start off with Springsteen's \"Tougher than the Rest\" which despite the slightly macho lyrics works brilliantly, ditto Paul Simon's \"American Tune\", although I'm afraid that I wasn't so sure about \"Baker Street\" with David Crosby on background vocals and the pedal steel subbing for the iconic sax.\nI love Tom Waits' song \"Hold On\" and this version is beautiful and wistful - probably my favourite track on the album, although the Creedence track \"Lodi\" runs it close, together with The Band's \"Acadian Driftwood\" and \"Heaven Is Ten Zillion Light Years Away\" originally done by Stevie Wonder. I hadn't heard Neil Finn's \"Private Universe\" before but it's an ideal song for Shawn who really sells it, I wasn't as convinced by the cover of Brenton Wood's \"Gimme A Little Sign\" which even with vocals from Marc Cohn does't come anywhere near the original.\n\nI didn't know the other songs - Graham Nash's \"I Used To Be A King\", \"Not A Drop of Rain\" by Robert Earl Keen Jr. and Tammy Wynette's \"Till I Get it Right\" - and am still getting to grips with them, although as with the other songs all are well-played and sound great. On the first play I wasn't quite sure about this record - some songs like \"Hold On\" sounded great straight away, while others took a while to grow on me. I also wasn't sure about the restricted palette of instruments which does make the record sound a bit samey and melancholy - fine on reflective songs like \"Tougher than the Rest\" and \"Acadian Driftwood\" but for me it didn't work on \"Gimme A Little Sign\" and could have gone either way on \"Lodi\". Shawn's own guitar and vocals are excellent throughout and I'm really enjoying listening to this mix of familiar songs and songs that are new to me.","classification":4}

{"text":"SPORTS is the greatest original album by Huey Lewis & The News. It was practically inescapable on the radio during 1983-84, and even those who are tired of hearing certain songs, such as \"The Heart Of Rock & Roll\", will find much to admire in the band's streamlining of English pub-rock, West Coast country-rock, early rock & roll, Southern boogie-rock, power-pop, Heartland rock, and soul\/R&B influences, as well as Lewis' opposition to people picking on each other's differences. Some of the best songs here are among the most underrated, including \"Walking On A Thin Line\", a harrowing yet rocking tale about a Vietnam veteran so traumatized by his war experiences that he won't let his younger daughter date until his older one finds a boyfriend, and the joyous rocker \"Finally Found A Home\", which could be about finding your roots musically. Many athletes, including the San Francisco 49ers during their Super Bowl-winning streak, as well as many people who worked out regularly during this album's chart run, loved SPORTS.

The releases have been solid, but lacking in spots.\n\nThe group can definitely still write a catchy tune. Tracks like \"Me and the Devil\", \"Thief\", and \"Dogtown\" prove this. Even the country feeling \"Little by Little\" has a catchy little groove to it, but the chorus gets grating much quicker than little by little.

{"text":"Released in September 1983, and the 3rd album from Huey Lewis & The News, Sports (which shows the Mill Valley, California bar The 2 A.M. Club on both the front and back covers) took a while to reach # 1 on the Billboard Top 200 album charts, but it did so by the end of June 1984, and has since gone on to become multiple-platinum. By the end of that year it was rated the # 2 LP for 1984, back of only Michael Jackson's Thriller.\n\nThe album also produced five significant hit singles, starting with his cover of a 1981 Exile entry, Heart And Soul, which peaked at # 8 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in September\/October 1983 b\/w You Crack Me Up on Chrysalis 42726. The following January\/February, I Want A New Drug topped out at # 6 Hot 100 b\/w Finally Found A Home on Chrysalis 42766, and in May\/June 1984, The Heart Of Rock And Roll also reached # 6 Hot 100 on Chrysalis 42782 b\/w a \"live\" version of Workin' For A Livin' which was not part of the album. His third straight # 6 Hot 100 - If This Is It (as well as # 5 Adult Contemporary) then emerged in August 1984 on Chrysalis 42803. That B-side, Change Of Heart, was also not part of the album. Finally, in November 1984, Walking On A Thin Line got to # 18 Hot 100 on Chrysalis 42825, but again the B-side, The Only One, was not in the album.\n\nA bit of controversy surrounding the album was the lawsuit (eventually settled out of court) that claimed Ray Parker, Jr. had plagiarized I Want A New Drug in his 1984 hit Ghostbusters. The musicians\/vocalists involved with this production are: Huey Lewis on lead vocals and harmonica; bassist Mario Cipollina, and guitarist\/saxophonist Johnny Colla, lead guitarist Chris Hayes, drummer\/percussionist Bill Gibson, and keyboardist Sean Hopper, who all provide backing vocals as well. John McFee plays the pedal steel guitar on the great Hank Williams tune, Honky Tonk Blues.\n\nThe tracks, with writers in brackets, are:\nSide 1\n1.

{"text":"Coming from a very personal place, `Love and Its Opposite' has a lot of heart (and pain) and that makes it accessible.  I love this breed of folk\/pop music.  I've never really gotten into Everything But The Girl, and I actually hadn't heard of Tracey Thorn until I saw this album and decided to check it out.  Overall, I'm glad that I did.  Despite the obvious passion in play here, there are moments where the album fails to make the impact that I think it was shooting for.  Like I said in my review title, this album is soft as a whisper.  That's works for some tracks but also deters others from their intended effect.  That's my only complaint.\n\nOkay.\n\nFor me, the best tracks on the album are the ones with a little spunk.  That's odd coming from me since I'm usually all about the dark, subtle and ominous tracks; but there is something about the way that Tracey tackles near disco pop quality of tracks like `Why Does The Wind' that makes me do a double take.  In fact, `Why Does The Wind' is most certainly my favorite track on the album.  I also love the bouncy rhythms of `Hormones'.  The song just makes me want to move.  It has such a friendly atmosphere about it.  In fact, there is almost a `kid's song' vibe to it that is amusing.  The 90's pop balladry that caresses `Late in the Afternoon' is just fabulous.  I really love the whole feel of this song.  It has some seriously deep lyrics, which rest easily against a seemingly nostalgic musical arrangement (simple yet reflective).\n\nThere is a slight upbeat quality to `Singles Bar' (a song which is supposed to be amusing I'm sure), but it also feels a tad awkward and uneventful at the same time.\n\nSongs like `You Are a Lover' really tap into the emotional side of Thorn's album.  This simple yet powerful delivery slips off every word with precision and delicacy.  The opening track `Oh, The Divorces' is another example of Tracey's using her emotional state to her advantage.  The song just sifts through poignant feelings while drawing in the listener.  `Kentish Town' has an almost angelic feeling to it, one that also carries an almost vintage feeling (like 90's folk\/rock).\n\n`Long White Dress' has a powerful message, but the song's construction is a deterrent.  It drags along and wears out its welcome very soon.  It just doesn't sit well on Tracey.  `Come On Home To Me' is almost eerie with the duet with Jens Lekman.  It seems a bit off when placed in the midst of the album itself, but it works to a degree.  Still, it is not my favorite despite the apparent haunting quality of the piece.\n\nReviews I've read have singled out `Swimming' as a highlight, but I have to say that it just didn't do it for me.  It reminded me of k.d. Lang-lite and it lost some appeal to me because of that.  I much prefer the bonus track, `Child Star'.\n\nWith an album that runs the gamut of a relationship with tracks that evoke many emotions felt by many people, `Love and Its Opposite' is a very solid album that will only get better upon reflection.","classification":4}

{"text":"This is the best Hard Rock song by a female ever. Had she have lived she might have produced more Rock along this line. But regardless even to this day there have been few songs that attack Rock n Roll like this.","classification":5}
{"text":"Remember extended LPs, those records you'd buy which had one song you liked? Remember how you convinced yourself it was OK to buy it, even though you didn't like the rest of the album? It was OK then, and it is OK now. \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,\" the album, has five songs you never heard of, and one song you should know. This song is the one you want. Skip the album.\n\nIn the rock-and-roll canon, that great list of songs everyone generally agrees is great, you'll find a few Elvis, Stones and Beatles tunes. Zeppelin will have their share, and you'll see the Doors, Clapton, Buddy Holly and other familiar names repeated throughout that list. Then, somewhere close to #100 or 150, you'll see 'Iron Butterfly'. Who? It doesn't matter who. It matters what. The what is \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,\" a 17 minute work of rock-n-roll art.\n\nTo say Iron Butterfly was a one-hit wonder is only relating half of the story. This wasn't like \"People!\" whose cover of \"I Love You,\" hit high and then was forgotten when band members split to do other things. That's a real one-hit wonder. Iron Butterfly had one hit, but it would be like if Zeppelin only gave the world \"Stairway to Heaven.\" The one song is enough to seal them in rock-n-roll history.\n\nHas anyone covered this song? No one cares, because this is the version everyone wants. Everyone else is just giving this version an homage.\n\nLike Skynard's guitar in \"Freebird,\" the drum solo here is what everyone talks about. The physical endurance to carry it off, and the musical strength to sustain the rhythm back into the song is amazing.\n\nI fully recommend, \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,\" by Iron Butterfly.\n\nAnthony Trendl\nanthonytrendl.com","classification":5}

This is by far their greatest album which they received recognition for from the Grammy's.

One of the all time best albums I have ever heard and although much of the music of other bands and singers goes by the wayside with age, this one does not. You can't help thinking that the edginess of the band in a state of turmoil from broken relationships actually inspired them to write so many hits for one album.

{"text":"There is a lot of buzz at the moment (Mid 2012) about a singer called 'Regina Spektor' and this is her latest album 'What we saw from the cheap seats'.\n\nI believe, from what I have read, that back in 2008 or thereabouts she won an award for best female singer. However, listening to this album, I can't see what the fuss is about. Regina is hardly a great singer, her songs are generally average and her piano playing is very good.\n\nThis is generally very simple music, with vocals and piano, and some songs have a bit more built up arrangements. Spektor's vocals are sometimes too soft, sometimes too fast, and, occasionally, good, but rarely impressive. Very few of the songs are notable. The third one, 'Don't Leave Me' is a nice reggae song, the last song, 'Jessica', is a nice ditty and the best song, the one where you feel more effort and passion was put into it, is 'Ballad of a politician' a song about the dirty deals. Some of the lyrics are really silly, especially 'All the rowboats', not that that's a bad thing.\n\nThe again, this album starts off really badly; Regina sings 'Small town moon' really fast and it's hard to understand the words, and things take a turn for the worse on 'Oh Marcello', which keeps interchanging between a cover of the Animals 'Don't let me be misunderstood' and some rapping - a terrible song!\n\nAll in all, there's very hardly any memorable songs, although there  are good moments, especially when she gets emotional at the piano. This isn't bad music, just unmemorable, treads already well worn ground, and when it does try to be original the results aren't very good. 2 \/ 5","classification":2}

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band<\/a>. There was orchestral rock before this masterpiece, and most rock albums using strings and horns from 1967 or 1968 sound nothing like Sgt. Pepper.\n\nOdessa sure doesn't. Where Pepper was really, on one level, about applying any type of music to rock--making it a limitless expanse, Odessa is extremely consistent in sound.\n\nOdessa shoots for an almost Spectorian, Wagnerian sense of orchestral pop. Huge strings, huge echo on the voices. Listen and the Beegees seem to sing out of the funnel center of the bigness they crate.\n\nYou'd better get used to this  sound if planning to sit through Odessa, because it runs through what was a double album. (Young? Call mom and she'll explain.) If you like this sound, it is like being stuck in orchestral mud honey. Just surrender and drown in it for the next seventy minutes. There are deviations: some silly sixties light pop, and some country tinged experiments that really work.\n\nBut what there is not is a grinding guitar like on Pepper's \"Getting Better,\" rock and roll stomp like\"Good Morning.\" You would barley know guitars plugged into amplifiers listening to Odessa.\n\nI understand why Pepper is used as a bench mark, and in the sense that rock bands were more free to \"experiment,\" after Pepper, this is accurate. But if Odessa does not actually sound like the Fabs benchmark, that is ok. This massive red string thing sounds fine on it's own","classification":4}

When I listened for the first time, I wasn't blown away as I expected to be.  But 'sweet surprises' have a way of sneaking up on you and when they 'arrive', they plant themselves firmly in your head and in your heart.\n\nSuch is the case with \"Better Than I Know Myself\" ... this song is radio-ready and, in fact, it's already being played on major stations. DJs are calling it 'flawless radio candy'.  This is a definite 'earworm' that you won't be able to get out of your head, but you'll love the dizzying delirious effect it will have on you.\n\nThe vocals are pure Adam Lambert, layering and harmonizing his own voice to sheer perfection.  The backbeat is a pulsating drum that is the perfect accompaniment to the soaring vocals and surrounding musical arrangement including a devilish tinkling piano.\n\n\"Better Than I Know Myself\" is NOT a song you'll swoon over on first listen, but like fine wine, it gets better with age, and in this case, age advances rapidly.  Several listens will make you a believer and craving for more.\n\nAdam has a Smash Hit on his hands!  You can bet on that one!","classification":5}

{"text":"Interpol hit pretty much rock bottom with the uneven and uninspired self-titled album in 2010. As a fan from the very first hour, it pained me to see the band slowly but surely go downhill with each and every subsequent release (TOTBL: 5 stars; Antics: 4 stars; Our Love to Admire: 3 stars; Interpol: 2 stars). With on top of that the departure of Carols D. in 2010 (right after \"Interpol\" was released), I thought it was pretty much the end of Interpol, frankly, in particular as Paul Banks became active with his solo career and has done some interesting things there. Sure, the band still toured, but it all felt so... dead-end. I was quite surprised when I read that a new album was being prepped, and so now, 4 long years after \"Interpol\", comes the band latest studio album.\n\n\"El Pintor\" (10 tracks; 39 min.) kicks off with \"All the Rage Back Home\" (1st single) and it is immediately clear that the band has decided to retreat, forcefully so, to the 'classic' sound of TOTBL\/Antics. \"My Desire\" taps in that same vein, with a bit more upbeat sounds. \"Anywhere\" is better yet, and would've been a more logical choice as lead single as compared to \"Rage\". A tentative \"My Blue Supreme\" sounds out the first half of the album. Starting the second half of the album, \"Everything Is Wrong\" is another highlight, with tight sounds and clear focus. \"Ancient Ways\" gives us dueling guitars, with great interplay between Paul and Daniel. \"Tidal Wave\" is a hard stomper. \"Twice As Hard\" closes the album on somewhat of a down note, and runs about twice as long as it should have. That aside, I am very happy to say that Interpol is BACK! After what seems like years in the (musical) wilderness, \"El Pintor\" proves that there still is life in this band. Bottom line: \"El Pintor\" is their best release since \"Antics\", now already10 years ago.\n\nI've had the good fortune of seeing Interpol in concert quite a few times over the years. When I saw them most recently (in 2011 at a small venue here in Cincinnati), they looked utterly bored with themselves on stage, and I thought to myself \"these guys are so done!\". Well, looks like I might be wrong (and happy to admit it). I hope they'll find their way to\/near Cincinnati, and I'll look forward to hearing how the songs from \"El Pinto\" resonate in a live setting.","classification":4}

{"text":"Well album titles should have a purpose and this one definately does.  Evolver which means moving forward in change.  This does not mean that the classic sound and vibe is not present but just in a different light.  With songs like Take Me Away, Satisfaction, and Cross The Line there is a popular music element but still in the same classic soulful Legend sound. Everybody Knows is more like his previous classic releases lyrically and of so true.  No Other Love\/W Estelle is especially groovy with a raggae tinge.  Andre 2000 w Green Light, the uptempo, first single release leads you into a string of hits. Brandy teams up with the Legend on Quickly and does not disappoint. Kanye with \"It's Over\" collaborate on this project adding more depth and dimension.\n\nGood Morning is of so extra-special with it's best intentions , much like I Love You, Love.  \"This Time\" is so big and beautiful, Legend is singing his haart out and hittin notes all over the place. They both speak volumes to and from the heart.\n\n\"If your Out There\", Legend's speaks to the world, promoting peace, love, unity and togetherness; which is consistent with the types of songs he writes. I definately hope that this song will be a part of the inauguration because it is the song\/sound of these times.\n\nI am truly wondering what those who stated or implied \"Legend on decline\" are listening too.  I feel like you never understood the artist's work in the first place. This project is Legend at his best and culminates his style impeccably . I truly hope he does not read those reviews and take any stock.  Listen to the lyrics and the sound;  you will discover John's Legendary sound. This is an Evolutionary Classic, Don't Be Dismayed.  This is definately a collector's item.","classification":5}

I love the calmness in most songs, and the music on this album strikes me as so seamless that I almost can't see them playing it while I listen. It seems like they are robots or aliens rather than humans. Great stuff and I was looking forward to it for a long time and definitely not disappointed.\n\nVINYL: Quality is decent... There are three tracks that really bug me with some distortion at certain parts, other than that my copy sounds good. I really do wish though that the whole record was just perfect because for example, halfway through Daydreaming when the bass comes in it just distorts and crackles on every note. Not a problem with my system or speakers as I play records every day and have no problems. So that really takes away from the song... Anyways, an okay pressing.","classification":5}

{"text":"Newcomer Sunshine Anderson has a goldmine here, with her album YOUR WOMAN. Sunshine provides a type of soul which has been absent from R&B in the past few years. YOUR WOMAN features some excellent R&B songs which people will just love. The record company has a hit here, so why aren't they promoting her? Well you might wonder the same thing when you listen to this cd, its amazing and its also amazing that she isn't being promoted with this great material. Take the first single which was a hit \"Heard it all Before\" a song about hearing the same excuses and lies over and over again from a lover. Its a great song, definately one of the best on the cd. \"Lunch or Dinner\" the second single, is another great song, and a missed opportunity to be a hit. The songs here deal with real issues people, relationships, love, things real people deal with. Other highlights include \"He Said, She Said\", \"Better Off\", \"Where Have You Been\" and \"You Do You\".

{"text":"Perhaps the most surprising thing about AMERICAN VI: AIN'T NO GRAVE isn't that it was released (we love to exploit our deceased talents), but that it is such a solid album.  These are among Cash's very last recordings, and it's true, his voice wasn't what it used to be (a review I read somewhere actually said Cash's voice got better closer to his death, or words to that effect; if you're offended and rather miffed, you aren't the only one), but that really isn't an issue on GRAVE.  Sure, his voice slips here and there--but not as much as it did on AMERICAN V.  And these are, overall, a better batch of songs, perhaps made slightly better by--of course--Cash himself, as well as the sparse acoustic arrangement.\n\nThis time, Cash covers songs from Sheryl Crow, Kris Kristofferson, Hawaii, the Bible, and classic country radio; plus we get one of his final originals, \"I Corinthians 15:55.\"  Every single tune here is strong, a testament to who Cash was and the life he lived, especially at the end.  There is not one disappointing song on here, and I mean that quite literally.  From the opener (which sounds a bit too much like \"God's Gonna Cut You Down,\" but maybe that isn't a bad thing) through the closer \"Aloha Oe,\" every single one of these tunes\/performances reaches into your soul and pulls at your heartstrings.  And it's not because these were Cash's \"final\" recordings; it's because of the passion he put into them, and the passion that went into Rick Rubin's finishing them up.\n\nOverall, Cash and Rubin's \"American Recordings\" series was one of the best things to hit the music world; I'd say \"country music,\" but let's face it--compared to the current state of affairs in country music, the \"American Recordings\" belong in an entirely different category altogether.  AIN'T NO GRAVE ain't no exception, if I may say so.  It's one of the series' stronger entries, even if Cash's voice wasn't as hearty as at the beginning.  Rest assured: if you purchase this album, and if you love music, you won't be disappointed.  I'm there's more exploitation on the way; but this album comes off as genuine, as heart-felt, because it's not a compilation or some tribute: it's Cash himself, even ending on the song of his choice.  This is a great album, plain and simple, from one of music's true (and too few) original talents.","classification":5}

I am sure other Anne Murray fans have used this  upbeat and positive song for that very purpose.  Others who like her and songs that are easier on the ears will surely enjoy it as well.  This Canadian songbird has a good voice and expression of emotion when she sings.","classification":5}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this review by stating that I hadn't intended to purchase this CD but my father-in-law asked for it for his birthday and, since it came with the AutoRip MP3 versions as well, we automatically own it. I figured it couldn't hurt to give it a listen and I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoy it! I like all kinds of music but mostly listen to country and pop and have been on a country kick this summer. Most of the Zac Brown Band songs I've heard in the past have been pure country so I was a bit surprised to hear several different styles of music on this album. Now, after having listened to it every day over the past week, I understand why the album is appropriately named \"Jekyll + Hyde.\"\n\n\"Jekyll + Hyde\" features 16 songs and has a wide variety of musical genres. If you listen to a country music station, you've probably already heard songs like \"Beautiful Drug,\" \"Homegrown,\" and \"Castaway.\" These three songs are some of my favorites on the album and I find them very easy to sing along to. \"Castaway\" has more of a Caribbean feel and sounds like a Jimmy Buffet type of song. Besides country and tropical-themed music, this album also has rock (\"Junkyard\"), folk (\"Young and Wild\") and one reminiscent of Frank Sinatra (\"Mango Tree\") which features Sara Bareilles. There are plenty of uptempo, fun songs that make me want to get up and dance (I actually have!) as well as some slow songs.\n\nWhat started as a present for my father-in-law ended up being a very enjoyable gift for both of us since we are really enjoying \"Jekyll + Hyde.\" We even had a conversation about this album this past weekend and since then, I've been listening to it more and more. If you are a die-hard country fan, this album may surprise you with how many genres can be heard on it but if you like many kinds of music, I think you'll enjoy it. Considering that I probably wouldn't have bought this album if it wasn't for my father-in-law, I'm glad I gave this album a chance because I really like it. I'll probably listen to more of Zac Brown Band's music now since I enjoyed this album so much!","classification":4}

{"text":"I'll be honest, the only reason I listened to this album was because of Kevin Parker. I think Kevin Parker is a musical genius and can do no wrong, so if he's cool with Mark Ronson I suppose I am as well. As far as albums go where there's tons of different artists playing puppet to Mr. Ronson's puppet master Uptown Special isn't too bad. But if you're here for something deep, meaningful, and precious go look elsewhere.\n\nSo how does this work, anyways? Does Mark Ronson write these songs and bring in people he likes to sing on them? Does he arrange and let the singers write lyrics? I have no idea. Up until this album I thought Ronson was just some wunderkind producer. Amy Whinehouse's Back To Black was where my ears perked up to what Ronson was doing. I loved the retro sound he made. But looking back he's put out at least two other albums under his own name. Don't ask me what's on those, as I have no idea. Anyways, Uptown Special is 37 minutes of funkified pop and dance music with a couple excursions into territory that lifts the overall project into something other than radio hits.\n\nThe songs? Well apparently \"Uptown Funk\" with Bruno Mars is a hit. It sounds like a hit. Mars is a hell of a singer with the whole package; dance moves, style, and the vocal chops to back it all up. It's a catchy tune that will surely steal the retro funk crown from Pharrell's \"Happy\". In a year grandmas and great aunts will be singing \"Uptown funk you up\" at wedding receptions across these great lands. You heard it here first.\n\nElsewhere Stevie Wonder even makes an appearance. He plays his world famous harmonica and sings on \"Uptown's First Finale\" and his harp reappears for closer \"Crack in the Pearl, Pt. II\". \"Feel Right\" has rapper Mystical doing his best hip hop version of Joe Tex' \"I Gotcha\". It's a fun song that you'll have to turn down when listening to it on your work computer(I learned the hard way.) \"Crack In The Pearl\" is kinda atmospheric with some great vocals. \"In Case of Fire\" has some rock guitar going on with an almost Steely Dan smoothness to it.\n\nBut to my ears the highlights on this album are the tracks that have Tame Impala's Kevin Parker on vocal duties. \"Summer Breaking\" has a 60s vibe to it with the fuzzy guitar, then when Parker's vocals come in it becomes this 70s soft rock slow burner that shouldn't work but does. \"Daffodils\" sounds as much like a Tame Impala song as it does a Ronson joint. Wiggy synths and an almost \"Billie Jean\" rhythm, it ebbs and flows with some serious stoned indifference. It has the vibe of Lonerism B-side \"Beverly Laurel\". This song alone is worth the price of admission. \"Leaving Los Feliz\" is a fun song with a great beat and another great vocal melody courtesy of Mr. Kevin Parker. A full-on collaboration LP between Ronson and Parker would be a cool thing to see and hear.\n\nOkay, so Uptown Special isn't going to change your world or blow your mind. It is, however, a fun and funky dance album filled with top notch production and a couple great rump shakin' tunes. Plus, Kevin Parker. Can't go wrong with that.","classification":3}

{"text":"When Megadeth released their fourteenth studio album \"Super Collider\" back in 2013, it received all kinds of mixed and negative reviews from music critics. Despite all the negativity, I personally thought it was a very solid, strong, and highly enjoyable album even though it wasn't an all out, in your face thrash metal assault, nor it wasn't Megadeth's best album by any stretch of the imagination whatsoever either, but I still enjoyed it nevertheless. The album would also be the last Megadeth album to feature both guitarist Chris Broderick and drummer Shawn Drover who both departed from the band in 2014, and they would both go on to form their new band Act of Defiance (awesome band BTW).\n\nNow, let's fast forward to 2016, as Megadeth have once again returned in a big time way with their fifteenth and latest studio album \"Dystopia\", and dare I say, it is quite easily the band's best offering since their 1990 classic masterpiece \"Rust In Peace\", and is also an awesome return to form to the classic thrash\/speed metal sound that Megadeth has been so well known for. With the addition of Angra guitarist Kiko Loureiro and Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler, \"Dystopia\" delivers an all around incredible and blistering performance that is complete with amazing songwriting and musicianship, awesome lyrics, furious, lethal riffs and fierce, dazzling, and shredding solos, and tight, driving, powerful drum work, and not to also mention that the production is also top notch here as well. The guitar interplay between Dave Mustaine and Kiko Loureiro is just absolutely fantastic here as they both play off one another so flawlessly throughout with their abundance of awesomely lethal, furious, dominating riffage and amazingly technical, fierce, colorful, dazzling, shredding solos, and believe me, the solos that Dave and Kiko both dish out on this album are truly incredible, and not to also mention Dave's mean, intense, snarling, pissed off vocals of course are in absolute full force on here as well. Elsewhere, bassist David Ellefson does an awesome job at providing strong, solid bass lines throughout, and of course Chris Adler's tight, driving, and dominating drum work here works wonders with excellent beats, fills, and very fancy double bass footwork. You can truly tell that Dave really made the right choice by adding both Kiko and Chris into the fold here, and there's certainly no denying that these two really bring so much to the table on this album here, and both their contributions on here have really paid off big time.\n\nThe album finds Mustaine and co. kicking things off with \"The Threat is Real\" which really harkens back to the band's \"Rust In Peace\" days. The song begins with a really cool Middle Eastern-flavored intro before letting it rip with a pummeling, in your face, thrash assault complete with speedy, thrashy, galloping riffing, and driving, stomping double kick drumming, gruff vocals, killer verses and addicting choruses, as well as deliciously fierce, blazing, shredding soloing to top it off. Definitely one of the best songs on the album, and one of my favorites too I might add. Following that is the album's title track \"Dystopia\" is another amazingly mind blowing highlight which resembles that of the song \"Hangar 18\" (from \"Rust In Peace\") in both song structure and atmosphere. The song is powered by a very effectively astounding, moving main riff, along with some very catchy, effective, and moving drum rhythms, great vocals and awesome lyricism, and more killer doses of colorful, dazzling, melodic, shredding solos, and there's also an awesomely rapid, pounding outro that will make you want to bang your head like nuts. The third track \"Fatal Illusion\" is also another one of my favorite songs here that features numerous tempo changes throughout that in a way recalls \"Bad Omen\" (from \"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?\"), and the song is also highlighted by an awesomely killer, and tasty bass riff from Ellefson, along with more fierce, stomping, double bass poundings, and awesome, killer riffage and ripping, shredding solo flights abound. Another great, strong thrasher. Next up, we have \"Death From Within\" which is a great, catchy and gallopy mid-paced headbanger that is anchored by some fantastic driving, rattling double bass drumming from Chris accompanied by some catchy, crunching, galloping riffage, plus another amazing batch of impressively melodic, and wailing solo flights, as well as another fantastic chorus, and some very cool, climatic vocal lines near the song's end. After that, we have track five, and my favorite song on the album \"Bullet to the Brain\" which is an absolutely powerful and chunky groove oriented number that begins with a dark acoustic guitar and military-like drum intro which is a soon followed up by an abundance of heavy, meaty, chunky riff work, along with powerful and intense vocals and lyrics from Dave throughout. However, the song's main highlight without question would have to be the guitar soloing especially from 2:30 to 3:35 which includes some deliciously wailing, winding, yet melodic, face melting duel solo flights from both Dave and Kiko.\n\nThe highlights keep on coming with \"Post American World\" which has a very strong \"Symphony of Destruction\" vibe to it. This song includes by a very brutal intro riff, and is further highlighted by more meaty, chugging, headbanging worthy riffs, and energetic, upbeat drum beats that back up the guitars perfectly throughout, along with another excellent chorus that also includes some nice, strong double bass kicking, plus more fantastic soloing including another awesomely juicy, melodic, shredding Dave and Kiko trade-off solo section as well. Another one of my favorites, \"Poisonous Shadows\" is a brilliantly epic 6 minute beast of song that has really risen to be one of my favorite Megadeth songs, and also a very progressive song at that. The song begins with a wonderous acoustic guitar opening that is soon followed by a great, melodic solo, and is also highlighted by some heavy, crunchy and grinding riffing and awesome double bass fills from Chris during the verses, as well as featuring yet another amazing chorus, plus an emotionally drenched and wonderfully melodic solo section, and a beautiful piano outro that tops it off. \"Conquer or Die\" is an absolutely fantastic neoclassic instrumental piece that is highlighted by a gorgeously amazing acoustic guitar intro by Kiko, along with some more awesomely wicked, wailing, shredding duel solo flights as well, and elsewhere \"Lying in State\" is another killer thrashing tune that is powered by busy and beefy, chugging riffage that just explode right from the beginning and just never cease to stop, plus there's also lots of great, pummeling and rattling double bass drum work throughout, as well as more excellent lead work, and great vocals from Mustaine too. Going forward, \"The Emperor\" is a very fun, catchy and contagious, rock and roll sounding type of song that is filled with a catchy, fast and up beat tempo accompanied by more awesome riffing and soloing throughout, plus great vocals and lyrics, and a very addicting and fun chorus to boot, and then we have an awesomely furious cover of Fear's \"Foreign Policy\" which closes the album on a very strong note, as the song is boasted by an assault of furious, seething riffing and leads, and vicious, pounding drums, and angry, vicious, snarling vocal attacks abound. Such a brilliant cover, I love it.\n\nNow for those who own the Best Buy limited edition of this CD just like I do myself, we are treated to a couple of fantastic bonus songs in \"Look Who's Talking\" and \"Last Dying Wish\". The former track is a brilliant headbanger that features a really cool intro that sorta reminds me of the beginning of \"The Conjuring\" with Dave's vocals soon quickly coming into play, and is further highlighted by an excellent, catchy chorus with some fast, pounding beats backing it up, along with more awesome riffing and scorching, ripping duel solos as well, while the latter mentioned track is another killer, scorching ripper that anchors stomping, pounding double bass drum beats, accompanied by yet more scorching, energetic riffs and awesome lead work, and also features another great chorus too.\n\nWith \"Dystopia\", Megadeth have not only released a modern metal classic, but they also have made a bold and strong statement that they are not even ready to hang it up anytime soon whatsoever. Not only is this album a return to form, but it is also a bold declaration of pure metal defiance especially in a day and age of overrated and overcommercialized mainstream drivel as well. Overall, \"Dystopia\" is just an all around brilliant release that delivers all the goodies on every front, and there's certainly no question in my mind, it is simply the best album that Dave Mustaine and co. have to offer since the Marty Friedman\/Nick Menza era, no questions asked. Anyways, I strongly recommend this album to any fan of Megadeth and metal alike...Buy it now and enjoy!!! Five stars Jack!!! \\m\/ \\m\/\n\nJeremy","classification":5}

{"text":"They have been wowing audiences now for nearly six decades. The group was formed in Brooklyn, NY in 1957 and was originally known as The Chesters. Just a year or so later they changed their name to The Imperials and ultimately to Little Anthony and the Imperials. Led by lead singer Anthony Gourdine the group would make some of the most memorable R&B singles of the early 1960s.\n\n\"Hurt So Bad\" is a song written by Teddy Randazzo, Bobby Weinstein, and Bobby Hart. The song was written specifically for Little Anthony. Over the decades it has been recorded by dozens of artists including Linda Ronstadt, The Lettermen and Jackie DeShannon. Most would agree that the definitive version of this tune was recorded by Little Anthony and The Imperials. Released in January 1965 \"Hurt So Bad\" would become a Top Ten hit. The song was performed by the group on their first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. I think we can all relate when Little Anthony cries out Like needles and pins people say \"you've been making out okay. She's in love don't stand in her way\"  There is pain oozing from every syllable in Anthonys mesmerizing vocal performance. One of the best soul records of the 1960's.","classification":5}

{"text":"KISS is a rock n roll band. In the 1970-80s era, they embodied an aspect of rock alongside the Who, the Stones and the others. Most of their music is high testosterone, like \"Strutter,\" \"Hard Luck Woman,\" and \"I Was Made for Loving You,\" bordering on self-parody. They were and are fun.\n\nThen there's \"Beth.\" It is a quiet song, but is gritty in its message. It isn't a metal ballad, but could have just easily been performed by Bread. There is depth, passion, and love. It is poetic, melodic, and, in my opinion, has earned its spot as one of rock music's greatest songs.\n\nIf the rest of KISS' songwriting was on par with \"Beth,\" KISS could've been more than a fun band stuck its era, but had a legacy to last until the end of rock n roll.\n\nIt begins:\n\nBeth, I hear you callin'\nBut I can't come home right now\nMe and the boys are playin'\nAnd we just can't find the sound\n\nIt ends:\nBeth, I know you're lonely\nAnd I hope you'll be alright\n'Cause me and the boys will be playin'\nAll night\n\nLook, if you are reading this review, you already know the song.

{"text":"I was initially underwhelmed by this album, which made all the critics' best-of lists for 2012, but eventually I realized what everyone was raving about.  The thing is, though, THE SEER is not equally superb throughout.  The second disc is just amazing, so don't be too hasty to form your opinion after only hearing Disc One.  The opening track (Lunacy) is fairly light, and there is a clear minimalist influence.  Then Disc Two shoots us screaming into space on a dark, psychedelic voyage!\n\nMichael Gira's reformed Swans are more powerful than ever.  The more recent TO BE KIND (2014) is more consistent than THE SEER -- it's stronger throughout -- but it does not reach the same heights.\n\nThe music of Michael Gira and Swans is raw, visionary and uncompromising.  His vocals remind of both Lou Reed and Iggy Pop, but the music is sui generis.  Listening is like plugging your mind directly into the black hole at the heart of the galaxy.","classification":5}

{"text":"When Tank emerged in 2001, he was already a seasoned veteran. In the late 90's he got his start as a background singer for Ginuwine and Aaliyah. By the time the 2000's rolled around, he was a songwriter for hire- appearing on albums by Dave Hollister, Toni Estes and the final studio album from Aaliyah. From the popularity of his work, he was signed to Blackground Records to release his formal debut \"Force Of Nature\"- which featured the lone song he produced, his biggest hit \"Maybe I Deserve\". On his sophomore effort- the rush released \"One Man\"- he took more creative control as the producer, helming nearly most of the album. But then, the album tanked and he sat out recording material for nearly five years. Within that time, he started writing songs for actor\/comedian Jamie Foxx who resumed his long-dormant recording career. Tank was hesitant about making music again until Jamie insisted that he continue to stick to his craft. He followed Foxx's advice and released his best recording to date- 2007's \"Sex, Love And Pain\". A couple of years later, he recorded the follow-up \"Sex, Love And Pain II: The All Night Experience\", but then wanted out of his contract with Blackground due to poor promotion on behalf of the label. He was forced to give up the album when he accepted the offer to sign with Atlantic Records to release what became his fourth album \"Now Or Never\".\n\nIn June 2012, Tank released his fifth recording \"This Is How I Feel\". It's his second album for the Atlantic Records label, and also his second album to feature a Parental Advisory sticker. This time around, Tank keeps things real simple on this album containing ten songs (The digital version contains thirteen tracks). On this new album, Tank works with a few well known producers, such as Troy Taylor (Trey Songz, Boyz II Men, Today) on the songs \"Your One\" and the closing track \"Lost It All\" which has slight sonic traces of Prince's \"Purple Rain\". Canadian producer T-Minus (Drake, Nicki Minaj, Ludacris) helms the first single \"Compliments\" which features Tank's labelmate T.I. as well as his protege Kris Stephens. Timbaland protege Danja (Britney Spears, Keri Hilson, Justin Timberlake) handles the album's title track \"This Is How I Feel\". He collaborates with Chris Brown for the second time on the pensive song \"Lonely\" and gets sensual on \"Nowhere\" which features an uncredited guest appearance from Busta Rhymes. While Tank does get sexual for most of the album, his strongest songs are when he's dealing with heartbreak and hurt. The songs where he's at his best are the aforementioned \"Lost It All\", the first single \"Next Breath\" and the best song on the record, the piano and orchestra driven ballad \"Better Than Me\". For all intents and purposes, Tank's \"This Is How I Feel\" is a fairly strong record- despite the rather short length of the album. While Tank can write great songs, it seems like he's trying too hard to appeal to a younger audience instead of making music for adults. Still in all, it's an album worth checking out.","classification":4}

{"text":"There have been several compilations of Lorrie's music featuring various hits, but none of them are definitive, though this is the best yet. Among the hits included here are We both walk, Half enough, Good as I was to you, I guess you had to be there, Train wreck of emotion, Standing tall and Something in red.\nApart from the hits, this collection contains five new recordings. These include a live cover of Angel (a Sarah McLachlan song) and an excellent cover of Another lonely night, one of Tammy Wynette's less heralded classic songs. There is nobody better suited to singing Tammy's classics, as Lorrie has been divorced almost as often as Tammy. The other three new tracks are To get to you, If I cry and Whoop-de-do.\nLorrie, like me, has very eclectic musical tastes and it shows in her choice of material. Unfortunately, many people these days prefer singers to choose a particular style and stick to it. Because of that, Lorrie's determination to record a variety of material has limited her success. Unquestionably blessed with one of the finest voices in contemporary country music, Lorrie should be a bigger star than she actually is.\nIf you only want one collection of Lorrie's music, this is the one to choose. Many of the missing hits can be found on her CD in the RCA country legends series. I've already reviewed that and recommend it if you enjoy this and want to explore further.","classification":5}

'Metal Resistance' gives me more of a progressive tone with some very fun listens. I can personally listen to 'Karate' 50 times a day or more. The fact that Baby Metal is out of the vein of NKOTB, Backstreet Boys and N*SYNC is crazy to think because they are not pop.. However, the music has a pop element to it and that is not a bad thing because the music is very much legit.\n\nI don't know what to expect from this trio espeically as they get older. What I am hoping for is that in the end they stick around and are given more liberties towards the album making process. As a rock fan scrounging for rock and heavy metal acts in a fabricated and pointless music world here in the United States. I am hoping that Baby Metal sparks a new Rock\/Hard Rock\/Heavy Metal revolution.","classification":5}

Bloomfield never impressed me much, so he has that NY Long Island playing style that worked in the Catskills, but came off as less than convincing outside that circuit. Stills? Please. What was the first side of this record was made stronger by virtue of the fact that Stills turned in a workmanlike effort. Sure, played hard, not much to show for it. I do suspect that this effort was the nascent arrival of an insufferable ego that would only undermine him as time wore on.\nGive credit to the remastering crew, though. You can hear pristinely how overwrought every note on this disc is. The 2002 remixes are a waste on top of something as thoroughly unnecessary as anything I've ever heard.

{"text":"I think it is important to say up front that I am 42 years old and have never been a huge Rolling Stones fan.  Sure, I've liked some of their music in passing but that was about it.  I don't think I've ever purchased a Stones album before and I've never really sat down and listened to hours of Stones music in a sitting until I got a pre-release version of this set and decided to give them a try.  So, this is a review from a casual \/ new Rolling Stones fan.  I see some reviewers here are already complaining about some songs being edited and how the remasters were done, for me I don't have enough Stones chops to notice any of that.  For better or for worse, I'm basically reviewing this as a Stones virgin.\n\nWith all of that said I liked this set, more than I thought I would.  The 50 tracks take the Stones from their very beginning through today and I think the audio quality on the tracks all sound amazing.  I would have to guess that I had heard, and was pretty familiar with, about 30 of these tracks before I listened to this set, which is truly amazing from just hearing the band on radio.  These guys have truly pumped out some great music over the years and I'm wondering if feeling like I was more in the Beatles camp over the Stones had kept me from enjoying some pretty good tracks.\n\nAs someone who does now own any other Stones material I have to say that this is a perfect primer for fans like me.  I'm sure some of the older fans will complain that it is just another repackage job, and that may be a fair argument until you realize that you're probably not the people they're looking to sell this to.  Buy the two new tracks on iTunes or here on Amazon and be happy.  For me, this set really has opened my eyes and taken my respect for the Rolling Stones up a notch.  It really is amazing that the sound, and Mick's voice, have kept up so well over the years.  The latest Aerosmith record showed Steven Tyler's voice showing it's age, but here Mick seems pretty much ageless.\n\nI am not sure exactly how the track listing was picked here, but I think it pulls a good assortment of music from the Stones catalog, I'm sure it's missing some tracks people think should be here and maybe that's true.  For me, as a new convert, I'm pretty sure I'll be going back through the old catalog to find out what else I've been missing out on.  So for the longtime fans that get aggravated with constant repackaging and ask why the labels do it, the answer is two-fold.  The first, and obvious, answer is to pull as much profit as they can out of a band.  The second, and one that applies to me, is to get new people interested in the music.\n\nThe bottom line for me here is if you're like me and have just enjoyed a Rolling Stones song from time to time on the radio this is the set for you.  My only caution is, like me, you may realize you've been missing out on some great music and now be opening your wallet to start going through a back catalog that is extensive!  I just looked it up on Wikipedia and it says the Stones catalog \"consists of 29 studio albums, 17 live albums, 30 compilation albums.\"  So much music and so little time!","classification":5}

{"text":"23 songs!!!! I gotta say it's a classic.  Case and point there only three songs people might not immediately feel, but those three songs might be great to another.  One thing is that even those 3 are good it's just when you compare 20 other bangers that sometimes 3 might sound okay and not matching up.  Plainly this is lightyears above the other stuff Raekwon has done solo lately as far as albums go (I'm not talking about his collabs).  To give a review the album follows a plot and a story line of a dealer's view of the streets, his life and stories.  It keeps you in the feel of watching a movie and his songs do not stray away from this theme and the beats are not monotonous Rae's relaxed flow doesn't get boring because he changes it up a little and in his storytelling you can identify with his narration.  That's enough of me writing.  This album is a classic.  It's great.  Ghostface is good and really does not outshine Rae (as he usually does). I wish Slick Rick would have given a verse and it killed me when he didn't. Right now I'm putting this above BP3 and saying this album right here is a rare gem worth it. Salute.","classification":5}

{"text":"If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden (\"Black Hole Sun\" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS!!!!!Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement. But the music?????O-H M-Y G-O-O-D-N-E-S-S!!!!!!!Who.....made this stuff,since I could hardly call written. Sometimes I wonder what goes through rock critics (of all ages) minds when they reviewed albums and put the moniker 'classic' on it. Okay first off Kurt Cobain is a rather pittiable figure-depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where I come from-I feel sorry for him. And his band (sorry) are so ametaurish it isn't even fresh or funny. Bands like U2 or The Clash were inexperienced at first but still made great,lively and powerful music from the beginning. But all this ends up is as an aural heroin 'daze'-the guitars are cloudy,Cobain's already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here \"Something In The Way\" still has no vital spark. To me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as Cobain wasted his talented (which may in fact exist) on forcing us to endure his inaudible,drug crazed 'wailing' of rants like \"Terrestrail Pissings\".And the acoustic \"Polly\"?Sounds like the worst garage band in the world. So why is 'Nevermind' called a masterpiece?Simple-Nirvana,despite fancying themselves anti establishment were (and still are)the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted PR campaign since the days of The Beatles. But there (again despite critics) is where the comparasin between Nirvana and The Beatles ends-for one \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is NOT a modern day \"More Then A Feeling\" and nothing Grohl,Cobain or the others do is anywhere close to Beatle-esque. Not only that (even if it's not Cobains fault) his music set a new record for rock n' roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has barely recovered from-to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and ALL of these records sound like 'Nevermind'.Also Cobains cynical and sad outlook,although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply.....stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive elements of their past. So this began the 'grunge generation' in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy record?Technically very much?Should it be stripped from the market?NEVER,and that's the only reason why this should exist. Every artist has the right to express themselves however they want as long as no one is getting hurt-it's in the constitution. But also everyone has the right to their opinion so I felt compelled to get one. So if you subscribe to the grunge culture and don't have this you probably should,you'll love it. But if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble,lack of melody and nothing but minor chords then you like me should probably steer clear. But I had to hear it to have an opinion. My main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses-I know others feel as I do. If Nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesn't always have to be a picture perfect one.","classification":1}

{"text":"Detox seemed like a sure thing near the end of 2010 when, after producing every song on Relapse, one of Eminems best two albums, Dr Dre released what was supposed to be its first single; a glossy party banger entitled Kush, featuring Snoop Dogg. It was a good start. But instead of finally putting the album out, he followed with one of his worst, albeit one of his most popular, songs; I Need A Doctor; and fell back into relative obscurity. It was an odd move rarely heard of in the world of popular music. Albums are pushed back, but almost never canceled after their first singles are released. The world was used to waiting though, for an album rumored and teased so ridiculously long that it was becoming a rap legend. Will fans ever get that Chronic epilogue? Dr Dre suggested not as he spoke about it in the past tense during a recent radio interview. I didn't like it, he said, It wasn't good.\n\nThat suggests he likes this album and thinks its good. Its what Detox was originally supposed to be, a Dr Dre album with all-new songs. It sounds like all new songs, but it doesnt sound like a Dr Dre album, which, considering the sonic differences between the two Chronics, isn't necessarily a bad thing. Whats disappointing are the songs themselves. If were comparing them to what came several years before, they simply cant compare. Theres no fun to be had here. Humor is pushed aside for solemn thug poetry. The club is passed by for a Compton street corner. But where are the drugs and the hoes? Worst of all is the lack of catchy hooks to sing along with. Wheres Devin? Who are all these dudes? Where's DJ Yella? Where Ren at? Kendrick Lamar is overrated. This sounds like one of his albums. Eminem was the best rapper by far in 2001. Why cant he go back to rapping like that in every verse?\n\nThis isn't Detox. I have to keep telling myself that. But it doesnt have to be. It just has to be good. Dr Dre thinks it is. I disagree. Theres nothing for me to latch onto here. The first song sounds surprisingly like the typical trap music of today. Dre didn't used to follow. He used to innovate. Not that he made most of these beats (himself) anyway. The man is 50 years old. Perhaps I should give him a break. But why? Hes still making songs, so I can still critique them. I aint heard nothing that I can consider classic, he says of other rappers songs, but, even with a team of ghostwriters and ghostproducers on hand, Im having a hard time coming across something I can even consider good here. Even the beats, the best parts of the album, leave a lot to be desired. Im not from Compton, so maybe it just isn't meant for me. But I like both Chronic albums and never smoked marijuana. Go figure.\n\nmarcellee.com","classification":3}

{"text":"This release is from a show recorded on Friday December 12, 1969 at a place that was briefly called the Thelma which little is known about. It was located on the Sunset Strip near the Whiskey. I knew someone up until about 8 months ago who caught the band quite a few times between 1966 and 1972 in the area and he couldn't remember the place (hey Gary H. if you read this). This was the third show in a three night stand with Steve Stills showing up at the first show on the 10th. Various parts of these shows have shown up in trading circles for decades. Even odder is that while some of the songs on the audience versions match the soundboard versions, others do not.\n\nAs for this show itself, the first 45 minutes were missing from the vault for many years although a passable version turned up in trader's circles a few years back. The show opens with a grooving Cold, Rain and Snow and a rocking Me And My Uncle. Both Easy Wind and Next Time You See Me are taken at a slow pace with Pig and Jerry singing harmony on Next Time. There are great early versions of newer songs like Black Peter, Dire Wolf, High Time, Casey Jones and the newish combo of China Cat Sunflower>I Know You Rider mixed in with older songs like He Was A Friend Of Mine. The show is brought to a screeching finale with a massive jam of Alligator>Caution>Feedback>We Bid You Goodnight. If you were fortunate enough to get the bonus disc subscription, then you have massive versions of Dark Star>Saint Stephen>The Eleven>Cumberland Blues and That's It For The Other One>Cosmic Charlie. If you missed that, head over to a torrent site and download the circulating copy of that show!","classification":5}

{"text":"Alanis' 2002 album UNDER RUG SWEPT is a good album, for the most part. She only falters on the songs \"So Unsexy\", \"That Particular Time\", and \"Precious Illusions\". Otherwise its a seamless album, filled with great songs. It opens with the rockin \"21 Things I Want In A Lover\", and into the sarcastically funny \"Narcissus\". \"Hands Clean\" was the first single, a nice song reflecting on a May\/December romance. \"Flinch\" is an absolutely brilliant acoustic song, a definite highlight on the set. \"You Owe Me Nothing in Return\" is my personal favorite on the album. \"A Man\" and \"Surrendering\" are also highlights from the set, just great songs. She closes with \"Utopia\", an idealistic song about the perfect society. I think it's a good follow up to her 1998 album SUPPOSED FORMER INFATUATION JUNKIE, which was art in itself, so to follow it up is pretty hard. UNDER RUG SWEPT is a solid album for the most part though.","classification":4}

{"text":"In the mid-90's Alanis Morissette's angry alternative rock struck a chord with many, and \"Jagged Little Pill\" went on to become the biggest-selling debut album of all time by a female artist. Of course, not all of us were anxious to have a 22-year-old girl tell us just how ticked off she was about this, that, or the other. And for whatever fans \"Pill\" didn't make, its followup, \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,\" with its lone hit \"Thank U,\" didn't exactly sway the vote either. However her third offering, \"Under Rug Swept,\" seems poised to expand her fan base.\nFor starters, she's not just asserting honest emotions this time, but a distinct artistry as well. She produced the set herself, and power pop guru Glen Ballard seems nowhere to be found; Alanis instantly dispells any notion that will harm things, however, as the irresistible leadoff track \"21 Things I Want in a Lover\" proves she's ready to reclaim a spot in radio. The album's actual first single, \"Hands Clean,\" is just as sharp and catchy, and, like the equally hit-ready \"Precious Illusions,\" even though the lyrics tell of a love gone wrong, she isn't so much telling the guy off as she is expressing reactions. Through it all, the sound is still a powerful one but the edges are ever so slightly rounded off; a subtlely more feminine approach that Ballard never offered her.  Perhaps part of the reason for this is, without Ballard to produce and co-write, some of Morissette's influences are coming through stronger, such as Sarah McLachlan and The Sundays.\nBut her growth isn't found solely in production. \"A Man\" offers a slow-burning, pulsating rock groove over a compellingly spiritual lyric, while \"Utopia\" finds her singing sweetly in a Sarah McLachlan-ish register over a chorus of acoustic guitars about her ideas of how to make the world a better place. Both songs are unfortunately uncommercial but also provide irresistible listens. And \"That Particular Time,\" with its haunting piano and elegant melody, clearly shows an artist in evolution.\nBut to see how far she has truly come, one has to listen to no more than the achingly gorgeous ballad \"Flinch.\" Sounding deceptively simple, Alanis uses a beautiful acoustic melody to lament a love affair she just can't get over. In the song, some time has apparently gone by since the breakup, and she mentions her brother running into the ex, singing \"I'd be paralyzed if I ran into you\/my tongue would sieze up if we were to meet again.\" Had this been \"Jagged Little Pill,\" she probably would have asked her brother where he saw the guy so she could be sure to run into him on purpose. But now Alanis opens up her emotional accessibility so far as to let us see a vulnerable, and therefore beautiful, resigned sadness. It's bravery like this, without the need to scream it in our face as she once did, that makes the album so impressive. In the same song, Alanis sings, \"some day I'll grow up,\" but what makes \"Under Rug Swept\" such a compelling listen is the fact that her maturity has clearly already begun.","classification":4}

{"text":"With the emphasis on the Motion, Motion City Soundtrack once tried unsuccessfully to take the mantle of pop\/rock from Blink-182. The pop was pretty good, but the rock kind of suffered. As a result, they now sound like a crazed Weezer after an all-night drug-binge. Mark Hoppus acts as band-wrangler this time, and the result is a pop\/punk\/rock tour de mayhem that brings down all musical minds like its cover depicts. And while they may still spend the first half of the album still trying to find themselves, as the cussing becomes more frequent, the quality also rises.\n\nHighlights Include:\nHer Words Destroyed My Planet\nDelirium\nPulp Fiction\n@!#?@!\n\nOverall, MCS is improved in almost every way, lyrically, musically & in catchiness. And while I don't exactly see a mainstream hit here, all fans of the genre should be pretty pleased, and the band should gain a legion of fans here. It may not hit as high as in previous works, but it's still especially solid. So here's to more binges like My Dinosaur Life, I could get used to hangovers like this.\n\nReal Score: 4.5\n\nNote: Don't get the censored version of this album. MCS is a lot better at working curse words into their songs this time around, and the lyrics are certainly lost more if they're bleeped out. Especially \"@!#?@!\" which I imagine would sound like a lot of dead air. Trust me, you'd be missing out. Parts of the album get pretty dark for the kiddies anyways.","classification":5}

This is definitely an improvement over her previous album Bionic.

{"text":"Ronald Isley has one of music's most distinct voices, period. When I think about Isley's vocal gift, I cannot find a modern vocalist who comes close to emulating his sensually driven brand of soul.  At 72 years old, it is a musical blessing that Ronald Isley is still able to successfully record albums, which makes his 2013 solo effort&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/This-Song-Is-for-You\/dp\/B00BEWNAA0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">This Song Is for You<\/a>&nbsp;so special.  The problem with the album is, that it just doesn't quite stack up with the classics of The Isley Bros. or even the Isley Bros.' most recent material which featured Ron in solo capacity anyways (at least for the most part).  It has its moments, but This Song Is For You's shortcomings most often come courtesy of some blas&eacute; material.\n\n\"This Song Is For You\" and first single \"Dinner And A Movie\" both show Isley at his best.  Vocally, his pipes shine commandingly here, riding the adult contemporary R&B production like a 'boss'.  Kem enters the picture for a duet on \"My Favorite Thing\" which is solid, but could use a little extra 'spice' from the tried-and-true.  As solid as Kem sounds, Ronald Isley captivates even more, delivering the more present vocal performance.\n\n\"The Boss\" finds Isley flexing his vocals expectedly, even if the song is a 'B' cut at best.  \"Bed Time\" follows up sensually right up Mr. Biggs' alley, but comes off unmemorable ultimately.  It doesn't help that that tempo is a grinder, which makes an average cut drag on even longer.  \"Another Night\" has great inspiration behind it by sampling the Isley Bros's '80s classic \"Between The Sheets\".  The problem is, you find yourself wishing \"Another Night\" WAS indeed the classic and not a less notable newbie.  By the time the Trey Songz featuring \"Lay You Down\" arrives, it is welcome because the effort was losing some momentum. The duet that brings veteran and burgeoning R&B artist is by no means the year's most triumphant get together, but it is one of the highlights from This Song is For You.\n\n\"Reunion\" can't quite match the bar raised by \"Lay You Down\", but Mr. Biggs does pretty good for himself ultimately.  He's better rounded on \"He Won't Ever Love You\" in which a many times tread concept retains its freshness given Isley's timeless voice and musicianship.  After that, it's pretty forgettable.  \"Better or Worse\" is so-so burdened down by continual relaxed tempi. \"Let's Be Alone\" begins promising with Bryan Michael Cox and Kendrick Dean running the show production-wise, but this infusion of promise only lasts briefly as the cut still drags a bit given tempo and overall sameness.  \"Make Love To Your Soul\" also fails to incite many thrills.\n\nUltimately,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/This-Song-Is-for-You\/dp\/B00BEWNAA0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">This Song Is for You<\/a>&nbsp;is not a 'thrill seeker's' album by any means. It does its job well of showing off the skill that Ronald Isley has shared with us vocally for years and years and years.  That said, it doesn't say truly 'accentuate' his\/his brothers' legacy the way that it could have with more thoughtful, creative material.  It should please the old-school crowd dying to hear another album from Isley, but for those who want some more of the hip Isley Bros of recent times like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Eternal\/dp\/B00005N8UV\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Eternal<\/a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Body-Kiss\/dp\/B0000931OT\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Body Kiss<\/a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Baby-Makin-Music-Feat-Ronald-Isley-AKA-Mr-Biggs\/dp\/B000BY8278\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Baby Makin' Music (Feat.

{"text":"My father bought 1975's \"Fleetwood Mac\" and 1977's \"Rumours\", and as a very young child (3,4,5 years old) I heard many songs over and over again from those albums (in a strange parallel, my parents divorced in 1976) so the lyrics, even at that young age, and the melodies, they all became are part of my musical DNA. Now, I hate to tell you fans, but I prefer Lindsey Buckingham's musical approach over Stevie Nicks'. That being said, during the 1980's I really enjoyed her hits, but avoided her albums. Now, of course, I have them all.\n\nAt 14 tracks, \"24 Karat\" is over-long. In repeatedly listening to the entire thing over the past weeks, it becomes apparent that 10-12 tracks would have been just fine. In fact, I can tell which two to four tracks I would have cut to make a stronger impression: \"Blue Water\", \"Lady\", \"I Don't Care\", \"All The Beautiful Worlds\", \"Belle Fleur\" and \"If You Were My Love\" and \"She Loves Him Still\". Yep, that's half the album. Well, seeing as this album is more a compilation of old songs than a brand new current album, it makes sense that there's excess and quality control issues. Now, it's all good and fine if you are a fan and think this album is the greatest. I stand apart from you.\n\nI found there were too many ballads, too many references to secret loves and loves lost without any direct connection to the material. You know, if you're going to do a ballad, it has to mean something, like, say, \"Leather And Lace\" or \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" or even \"Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You?\" or even one of my favorites, \"Two Kinds Of Love\".\n\nI like Stevie Nicks as much as the next person, but let's be straight: Aren't you looking forward to a newly reunited Fleetwood Mac album? And, wouldn't you like the same double-disc re-mastered treatment reissue of \"Mirage\", \"Tango In The Night\" and \"Behind The Mask\"? Aren't those well over-due? Heck, how about re-mastering and reissuing \"Bella Donna\", \"The Wild Heart\", \"Rock A Little\" and \"The Other Side Of The Mirror\"? What about Lindsey Buckingham's \"Law And Order\", \"Go Insane\" and \"Out Of The Cradle\"?\n\nAnyway, it's good to see Nicks working with Dave Stewart again. I think that's a good musical match.\n\nHere's how \"24 Karat Gold--Songs From The Vault\" compares to Nicks other works:\n\n1981 Bella Donna: Three and a Half Stars\n1983 The Wild Heart: Three and a Half Stars\n1985 Rock A Little: Four Stars\n1989 The Other Side Of The Mirror: Four Stars\n1994 Street Angel: Two and a Half Stars\n2001 Trouble In Shangri-La: Three Stars\n2011 In Your Dreams: Three and a Half Stars\n2014 24 Karat Gold--Songs From The Vault: Three Stars","classification":3}

{"text":"Elegantly produced by Alan Parsons, Al Stewart's Year of the Cat is a classic of smooth 70s light rock. It's like going to bed on a warm summer night as a breeze blows lightly through the curtains. Like snuggling on a soft giant papasan chair in 1976 and having this on eight-track. Like buttah. No rough spots whatsoever; even the heavier guitar solo is balanced by strings to maintain the equilibrium.\n\nIf it were some sappy 70s love song I wouldn't like it. It's romantic, yes, but also esoteric and cool, like a Bogart movie. A tourist arrives in a town and meets a mysterious woman. He spends the night with her and in the morning realizes that he has been left behind by his tour group so he is stuck there. No big deal to him, he's carefree and open. Any way the wind blows....\n\nIt has some of my favorite lyrics of any song, especially:\n\nShe comes out of the sun in a silk dress running\nLike a watercolor in the rain\n\nGives me goosebumps sometimes when I hear that.\n\nAlso, you go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre contemplating a crime. I had no idea who Peter Lorre was for a long time, but I knew his voice from cartoons. Eventually I saw him in Casablanca. He was also incredible in M.\n\nShe comes in incense and patchouli. Nowadays, whenever I hear the word patchouli I imagine John Cusack telling Tim Robbins to get his 'patchouli stink outta my store' in High Fidelity. Great film for music geeks.\n\nThe middle instrumental passage is great as well. It flows...strings at 3:10 into light electric guitar at 3:24 into heavier electric guitar at 3:54 into Phil Kenzie's superb saxophone at 4:14...then into the final verse.\n\nFYI: the cat is the fourth animal symbol in the 12-year cycle of the Vietnamese zodiac, replacing the rabbit in the Chinese zodiac. So, if you were born in 1963, 1975, 1987, or 1999, you might be a cat.","classification":5}

{"text":"When it has honestly came down to Rihanna, she musically has been one the worst singers to have ever came out the past decade. When I heard she had went back to the man who physically abused her before the Grammy Awards, Chris Brown, I think she made herself a much easier target of abuse and unhappiness. That sadly has also had hurt her in her music as well with poor songs as well. That continues to show her weakness with Stay from her Unapologetic album. She has lost herself in her voice, and weakness in her strength. I found the song to be not as striking as her earlier songs were. I think Rihanna should take a very long break, and find herself as a woman, which she has not even grown herself in being yet.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2}

{"text":"I love Meghan Trainor. Im sure Im not her target audience but I don't care. I've got a thing for songs about strong\/independent\/capable women. Meghan Trainor fills that need. Her second album is a solid follow up to her debut. Its got a different sound in places where shes trying some new things. Some of them work. Some of them.not so much. But admire her for trying something new and not letting herself get tunnel vision on her talents.\n\nThe Beatles started off with songs like Twist and Shout. When they did Across the Universe people called them innovative. So changing your sound isn't an inherently bad thing.\n\nOverall though I loved this album. There are only a couple of duds in the mix. What I really like about Trainor is her themes, and those are strong. Her music is fun and catchy. It's just good times. People seem to HATE 'No' but I like that one. So it's all about preference. It's great party music. It's not going to reach you on a deep spiritual level and change your life.\n\n Watch Me Do - This isn't my favorite Meghan Trainor song, but it's alright. It's one of those deviations from her earlier sound, but it's still in line with what she does overall. Her rhyme schemes in this one are strong. But the overall lyrics come off as weak, mainly because she's trying to force the rhyme schemes with words that don't quite fit. These words sound cool together, but don't always make sense. (Think Dr. Suess, but with less completely made up words) I like the message though, which is that she looks good without a lot of work because she's happy with who she is. (At least that's what I'm getting out of it) That message is right in line with Meghan Trainor's overall theme. It's got a heavy drum background on the track as well, which should come as no surprise if you've listened to Bang Dem Sticks off her debut album. She's clearly got a thing for drums (and drummers). All in all this one probably makes a better dancing song than a sing a long song.\n\n Me Too - Closer to her vocal sound from her earlier work with a slightly new background sound. This track is working. It's a fun sound. The lyrics follow her standard \"I'm confident in myself and don't need you to validate me\" theme. This one is almost to the point of narcissism. If someone was speaking these lyrics to me I'd laugh at them for being that full of themselves. But it makes for a great song! It's fun to sing a long with as we all like to sing about how great we are to ourselves even if it's exaggerated.\n\n No - This song is all about telling men at bars to piss off and leave her alone. (Which is kind of odd for an artist who wowed me with her song 3AM, but hey...what she does at 3 in the morning should in no way dictate what she should do in a bar. So good for her!) The lyrics are clean. I like it. This song is getting a ton of hate, but I really like it.\n\n Better - This has a techno background sound that's very different for Trainor. This is definitely more of song you'd hear when dancing towards the end of the night when things are slowing down a bit rather than a song you'd sing along to in the car. Trainor's voice and style just don't play well with this song. She has a distinctive sound that is completely lost on this track. With that missing this track ends up being rather generic. The lyrics did nothing for me either. Yo Gotti adds nothing. He doesn't pair well with Trainor. His rhymes aren't great. Ultimately it's an okay track. It's not bad. But it's not good. It's just kind of there.\n\n Hopeless Romantic  Much softer than most of the rest of her body of work. This is a slow song with Trainor, a guitar, and some background vocals. Its very soothing. And its a beautiful song about not giving up on love and believing you deserve to be loved.\n\n I Love Me  The title is a solid clue into the content of the song. It's all about loving yourself for who you are and not giving a rat's butt what other people think. And that is definitely right in line with the woman who gave us All About That Bass. I just love Trainor's general theme of being happy with herself and who she is. It's such a positive message and her songs just make you feel good singing them. I'm not familiar with the musical stylings of LunchMoney Lewis, who's vocals appear on this track more than Trainor's. But he's good on this song. He's got a bluesy voice signing hip hop rhymes all to a jazzy beat. It's a heck of a combo. Trainor matches his style in this song. Then there's rhythmic clapping in the background. It's all very catchy.\n\n Kindly Calm Me Down  Opening up with a piano and echo vocals, this sounds cool. Its another slower song that shows Trainor can sing. It picks up half way through with more bass (Shes all about that bass, if you weren't previously aware.) Its all about the power of love to right the wrongs of the world by letting 2 people forget about the universe around them.\n\n Woman Up  Mark my words. This is going to be the next song that people go nuts for when its played at bars and clubs. Its all about looking good and having a good time. Its a party song. It sounds awesome. Like really awesome.\n\n Just a Friend To You  This makes good use of a ukulele. (Theres a phrase you don't hear everyday) You ever been in love with someone who calls you just a friend? The dreaded friend zone? Its a song about that. Its a slow song and its very well done.\n\n I Wont Let You Down  The beat picks back up. The song is all about redemption towards someone you didn't treat right. I like the idea that theres always a chance to apologize for your mistakes and then show you mean it with actions.\n\n Dance Like Yo Daddy  Its a thumpy bass beat with Trainors pop rap style telling you to dance. But not to dance well. To just get on the floor and move your body however feels right, not giving a rats butt about how goofy or stupid you might look. The refrain includes the line If you cant what they think you cant have no fun. As someone who cant dance to save his life. I am ALL about this song.\n\n Champagne Problems  You know the phrase First World Problem? its a song about that. Its funny. Its catchy. Its well done. Its about her Uber being late, her Wifi not working, her iPhone dying..you get the idea. And its about how she knows to let those things go and enjoy like anyway. Its a really good theme.\n\n Mom  Meghan Trainor loves her mom. This is a song about that. Its a GREAT song about moms. Go play it for your mom right now. Its an awesome song for mom. I think Meghan Trainor has her mom on this track too (Hence the featuring Kelli Trainor)\n\n Friends  This is a song about loving your friends and having them be all you really need. Its about your girlfriends. As a guy I don't have this kind of friend circle. But I get it. And my wife absolutely LOVES this song.\n\n Thank You  This song is VERY modern pop. And not in a good way. The title track to this album is very generic. Its not a bad song. It just sounds like every song thats been on the radio for the past 5 years. Megan Trainor can do better than this.","classification":5}

Very nice.\n\nA Framed Light in Charming Light by Jamie Woolford. Very competent, professional even slightly predicable, quality rock song.\n\nNew Bones by deadhorse. Not entirely sure which deadhorse this is, I will go with experimental, electronica, indie from myspace although The Dead Horse Band is the name in myspace. Nevertheless, solemn, extended instrumental number (ambient) with enough drama and content to listen all the way through the song. Once.\n\nWorld Noose by Girlfight. Short punk song nothing wrong with this.\n\nTidal Wave by The Story Changes. Genre, Post punk, powerpop, rock per myspace. Great hair band classic arena rock opening sound with more going on.

Bouncing along, simple instrumental sound with new noises joining in including some simple guitar action near the end. Over 7 minutes, you may love it.\n\nTrack 8. Giants Sleeping by Koji.

If you want to hear layers of keyboards, drums and guitars sweeping in and out like a turning tide this is the song. Excellent.\n\nSleepwalkers by Failsafe. Too many genres to list (from Wikipedia) I'll take Art Punk mostly because I've never heard of it. Great song, frantic band and vocals provide great harmonies between classic alt. lead vocal on quality alt.\/punk song. Love it.\n\nBad Way by PJ Bond. Cool s\/sw style number with active backing band. Some edginess to the song including F word if you are driving with the kids. Weird cuty at one minute remaining Like it.\n\nHey Ma, Pt. 2 by Mixtapes. Great frantic indie punk opening and sound. 90 seconds of sounds-excellent.\n\nLast track. An Island in the Dark by Gracer. Cool tense lead vocal opens in front of better ambient sounds. Bass throb and vocal rule the song as synthesizers build and play.

In the late '50s into the '60s the folk music scene overflowed with talent including Dylan, Beaz, Peter,Paul and Mary to name just a few. By the mid-60s as Dylan shocked the folk music scene by playing an electric guitar at Newport, folk music itself would soon follow suite. \"Turn, Turn, Turn\" would become the most well known and loved song of the folk-rock movement. Performed by The Byrds, music written by Pete Seeger and the words from the book of Ecclesiastes combines for a memorable recording.

{"text":"When it has came down to Lady Gaga, it seems as if she is trying to get the overexposure that a lot of the younger wannabe acts have had like Rihanna and Beyonce'. Unfortunately for her, that shows absolutely less-enthustiatic and poor chemistry that she and Beyonce' have shown with their collaboration, Telephone from Lady Gaga's The Fame Monster. I really wasn't very impressed that she would honestly take the same kind of page that Beyonce' had brought out last year with Video Phone from Beyonce's extended version of I Am Sasha Fierce, where she made a simple song, and turned it into a made-up collaboration with absolutely no chemistry. I think Lady Gaga really should and try to know when to hole it and fold it, because it definitely wasn't fully shown here. Maybe her next single will be better than just getting a dial tone, and nobody will answer on the other side.\n\nSong: D","classification":2}

{"text":"The Haydn String Quartet recordings by Dekany Quartet and Fine Arts Quartet were first released on Vox LP in the 1960's, in 10 volumes with 3 LP's per volume for a total of 30 LP's (I found one listing for the set of LP's on one of the online auction websites). In fact, this may have been the first stereo release of a complete collection of Haydn string quartet performances?\n\nVox later issued these on CD, for example:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/String-Quartets-1\/dp\/B000001K4H\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">String Quartets 1<\/a>. That particular CD has been available on Amazon for some time, including the .mp3 download, at normal price (the .mp3 listing in fact is fairly expensive). [I'm not able to locate other CD listings on Amazon but if I do find links then I'll update this review to include for reference (the reviews to the CD releases will be useful references for anyone who might be interested in reading what other listeners have to say about these performances). Some LP listings are also available on Amazon, or they can be found on ebay].\n\nAfter some research I was able to determine with a fair degree of accuracy how the Vox LP's were originally packaged and released. The project was initiated with the Dekany Quartet, and the Fine Arts Quartet took over as of Volume VII:\n\nVol I: Op. 1, Nos. 1-2; Op. 20, Nos. 1-6 -- Dekany Quartet. Vox SVBX 555 (3 LP). Released (?)\nVol II: Op. 33, Nos. 1-6: Op. 1, No. 3, 4, 6 -- Dekany Quartet. Vox SVBX 556 (3 LP). Released (?)\nVol III: Op. 54, Nos. 1-3; Op. 55, Nos. 1-3; Op. 42 -- Dekany Quartet. Vox SVBX 559 (3 LP). Released 1966.\nVol IV: Op. 17, Nos. 1-6; Op. 77, Nos. 1-2 -- Dekany Quartet. Vox SVBX 561 (3 LP). Released 1966.\nVol V: Op. 2, Nos. 1-4; Op. 71, Nos. 1-3 -- Dekany Quartet, Vox SVBX 562 (3 LP). Released 1966.\nVol VI: Op. 9, Nos. 1-6; Op. 51 \"The 7 Last Words of Christ\" -- Dekany Quartet. Vox LP SVBX 563 (3 LP). Released 1967.\nVol VII: Op. 50, Nos. 1-6; Op. 103 -- Fine Arts Quartet. Vox SVBX 595 (3 LP). Released 1968 (recorded 1967).\nVol VIII: Op. 76, Nos. 1-6 -- Fine Arts Quartet. Vox SVBX 596 (3 LP). Released ? (recorded 'late 1960's').\nVol IX: Op. 64, Nos. 1-6; Op. 2, Nos. 5, 6; Divertimento Op. \"0\" -- Fine Arts Quartet. Vox SVBX 597 (3 LP). Released 1971-72 (?)\nVol X: Op. 74; Op. 3 -- Fine Arts Quartet. Vox SVBX 598 (3 LP). Released 1971 (?) (perhaps recorded 1964??).\n\nThe Dekany Quartet was the predecessor to the Haydn Quartet, and consisted of Bla Dekany and Jacques Hartog, violin; Erwin Schiffer, viola; George Schiffer, cello.\n\nThe Fine Arts Quartet at the time of these recordings consisted of Leonard Sorkin and Abram Loft, violin; Bernard Zaslav, viola; George Sopkin, cello. It is still active, with a new lineup of performers.\n\nOK, so much for the history and background to these recordings. Now Vox has pulled these all together into one 'MegaBox' release, and it's quite an exceptional value. At three bucks for roughly 24 hours of music, it's comparably priced to those excellent 99 cent Bach Guild boxes that may contain anywhere between a few hours, to 9 hours or more of music each.\n\nI find myself continually struck by the remarkable availability of great music at low prices, not just these bargain download packages but the box sets that continue to be released by the major labels, oftentimes containing 50 or more CD's at just a dollar or two per disc. We are truly living in a golden age of music, with so much easily available and at such affordable prices.\n\nWhat really makes this worthwhile, though, is the quality of the performances and recorded sound. I'm just beginning to dip my toes into this collection, but the tracks that I've listened to so far are quite good. These are stereo recordings, not mono. If I do note any problems with this collection, I'll update this review accordingly (occasionally, some of these inexpensive download packages on Amazon have errors with a few tracks, duplications or omitted tracks, etc. I'll make note of those problems here, if there are any).\n\nAltogether, this comes to 323 tracks (!) and with a total time of 23 hrs and 47 minutes (according to my iTunes)! (make sure you have a good quality internet connection if you plan to download the entire collection, as I did. It's a lot!)\n\nI am also impressed by the completeness of this collection, after going through it and comparing it to my reference for these works. I find nothing omitted. I have two other sets of Haydn's string quartets (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Festetics-Quartet-on-period-instruments\/dp\/B00NB8L0E8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Festetics Quartet, on period instruments<\/a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Schneider-Quartet\/dp\/B00OHEHFLC\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Schneider Quartet<\/a>), and both of those particular sets have a few omissions and are not, strictly speaking, 'complete' (my reference is the wiki article 'List of string quartets by Joseph Haydn' which I am taking to be an accurate compilation of these works).\n\nFor reference, here is a list of all of Haydn's String Quartet compositions (using the wikipedia listing as my source), indicating which are included with this collection:\n\n- Op. 1, Nos. 1-6 -- COMPLETE (String Quartets Nos. 1-6)  (See Note 1 below)\n- Op. 2, Nos. 1-6 -- COMPLETE (String Quartets Nos. 7-10, plus two unnumbered SQ's)\n- Op. 9, Nos. 1-6 -- COMPLETE (String Quartets Nos. 11-16)\n- Op. 17, Nos 1-6 -- COMPLETE (String Quartets Nos. 17-22)\n- Op. 20, the \"Sun\" quartets, Nos. 1-6 -- COMPLETE (String Quartets Nos. 23-28)\n- Op. 33, the \"Russian\" quartets, Nos. 1-6 -- COMPLETE (String Quartets Nos. 29-34)\n- Op. 42 -- COMPLETE (String Quartet No. 35)\n- Op. 50, the \"Prussian\" quartets, Nos. 1-6 --  COMPLETE (String Quartets Nos. 36-41)  (See Note 2 below)\n- Op. 51, The Seven Last Words of Christ -- COMPLETE\n- Op. 54, the \"Tost\" quartets, set I -- COMPLETE (String Quartets Nos. 42-44)\n- Op. 55, the \"Tost\" quartets, set II -- COMPLETE (String Quartets Nos. 45-47)\n- Op. 64, the \"Tost\" quartets, set III -- COMPLETE (String Quartets Nos. 48-53)  (See Note 3 below)\n- Op. 71, the \"Apponyi\" quartets -- COMPLETE (String Quartets Nos. 54-56)\n- Op. 74, the \"Apponyi\" quartets -- COMPLETE (String Quartets Nos. 57-59)\n- Op. 76, the \"Erddy\" quartets -- COMPLETE (String Quartets Nos. 60-65)\n- Op. 77, the \"Lobkowitz\" quartets -- COMPLETE (String Quartets Nos. 66-67)\n- Op. 103 -- COMPLETE (2 movement SQ not completed by Haydn) (String Quartet No. 68)\n\n- Op. 3 -- COMPLETE (Hob. III 13 through 18) HOWEVER, PLEASE NOTE that there has been uncertainty regarding whether or not these string quartets were actually composed by Haydn, or by the composer Romanus Hoffstetter (1742-1815). They are included at the end of the collection, tracks 303-323, and the title for each track states that they are likely by Hoffstetter. See additional comments to this review below, for further discussion.\n\nNotes:\n\n1) The String Quartet in E-Flat Major, Op. 1, No. 0, Hob. II\/6, usually referred to as Quartet No. 5 (also referred to as Opus 0) is included but designated here as Divertimento in E-Flat Major (tracks 1-5). The String Quartet in E-Flat Major, Op. 1, No. 5, Hob. III\/6 (arrangement of Symphony A) is also included as tracks 290-292 and labeled here as String Quartet No. 5. This set therefore includes the complete Op. 1 works, 7 quartets (see the wiki article on 'List of string quartets by Joseph Haydn').\n\n2) There are two SQ's labeled as No. 41:\n---- tracks 151-154: Labeled as SQ No. 41, Hob. III\/44 -- in fact this is SQ No. 36\n---- tracks 171-174: Labeled as SQ No. 41, Hob. III\/49 'The Frog' -- correctly labeled\n\n3) The labeling for the Op. 64 SQ's doesn't include the number of the SQ, so for those interested in having the tracks numbered with that information:\n---- tracks 208-211: String Quartet No. 48 in C Major, Op. 64, No. 1, Hob. III\/65\n---- tracks 212-215: String Quartet No. 49 in B Minor, Op. 64, No. 2, Hob. III\/68\n---- tracks 216-219: String Quartet No. 50 in B Flat Major, Op. 64, No. 3, Hob. III\/67\n---- tracks 220-223: String Quartet No. 51 in G Major, Op. 64, No. 4, Hob. III\/66\n---- tracks 224-227: String Quartet No. 53 in D Major \"The Lark\", Op. 64, No. 5, Hob. III\/63\n---- tracks 228-231: String Quartet No. 52 in E Flat Major, Op. 64, No. 6, Hob. III\/64","classification":5}

{"text":"This was my first Toro Y Moi album, the purchase prompted after hearing two most excellent songs (one of which, \"Say That,\" is on this album) on some compilation discs (one from Mojo Magazine, and the other part of the \"Late Night Tales\" CD series). Anyway, I was so impressed by those two songs that when I found this CD at a shop in Kuala Lumpur recently I didn't hesitate to take the plunge. About two dozen listens later I'm hooked!\n\nLike many other reviewers, I'm both captivated by this guy's music (and Toro Y Moi is indeed one guy: Chas Bundick), and also unable to categorize it, at least not easily. Toro Y Moi straddles musical borders, hops across them, and integrates a variety of styles into his songs. The closest artist that he compares to, in my opinion, is Todd Rundgren. In fact, if Todd was 30 years younger, he might be making similar music as Toro Y Moi. Both artists are virtually one-man bands, able to produce, write, sing and perform their music in a seemingly effortless fashion ... and turn your head around in process. They both share an uncanny ability to write catchy pop songs with very soulful undercurrents. The biggest difference between the two, aside from the obvious gap in ages, is that some of Rundgren's song veer off into a rockier direction, while Bundick mines a funkier musical vein. But each guy qualifies as a musical wizard who knows how to optimize his use of a recording studio.\n\nAs much as I like this Tory Y Moi album, there are a few tracks that don't quite dazzle or sustain interest. But even when it doesn't all click, you have to admire the effort. I think this guy is an incredible talent and capable of delivering a true masterpiece of an album. And that may be coming very, very soon. I'll be eagerly waiting.","classification":4}

{"text":"When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, she has been a product as a singer, and not really a human singer. Sincerely, and sadly the quality of her songs have absolutely been awful. The surprise album she pulled out last year has had some really bad songs from Partition to Pretty Hurts. But her latest song is definitely one of biggest low points, trying to be a edgy hip hop artist, and instead throws it all away. Flawless, the latest single from her lackluster self-titled record is really a pathetic song. She doesn't actually deliver from each and every note. Not only is the chemistry she and Chimamanda awful, it sadly is just as poorly overplayed as her work with her husband Jay-Z on Drunk In Love. I think Beyonce' should re-consider finding her own voice again, and stop rushing records that make her weak from the heart, and more flawed in the soul.\n\nSong: D","classification":2}

This is one of the sneaky albums that the more you play it, the more the songs grow on you. Pick your favorites; some obvious highlights and a few sleepers, but when push comes to shove, it's all good. And a double album?! Really, you won't find any filler on here. I read one review that lamented the fact that Mark isn't playing wildly inventive guitar riffs like he did back in the Dire Straits days. Well, I'm one of those listeners that prefers a solid finely crafted song over hot guitar licks any day of the week. And you have to give Knopfler credit for morphing into a genuinely excellent songwriter and all around talented musician and recording artist. Hot guitar players are a dime a dozen, but people who can write songs of this quality are a rare species. Sit back and savor this one.","classification":5}

You can't help fall for her, and be driven to comfort her, yourself, or one you love, or have lost.  Some of my peers do not get this song.  I think that is actually a compliment.

{"text":"When it has came down to movie songs for Disney, lately they honestly just have not been able to thrive in the way they used to back years ago, and all the way through to the 80's and 90's, with massive success for films like Toy Story, The Lion King and Beauty & The Beast. But lately, a lot of the movie songs have been less than strong to the ability they have used to. Today, unfortunately, songs like Sia's version of Nat King Cole & Natalie Cole's Unforgettable from Finding Dory, really fell below the massive standards that Disney had been known for before. Pink is another example who has also been suffering from that lag too. She had some really good songs that fit nicely for films like Charlie's Angels 2, and when she did Lady Marmalade for Moulin Rogue with others like Christina Aguilera and Mya. Just Like Fire from the Alice In Wonderland film with Johnny Depp, doesn't actually deliver in the magic, the way that Disney had that movie & Song like Colors Of The Wind from Pocahantas. I really didn't feel she was driven in song and heart, they way she was recently in songs like True Love. This is a fair download for die hard Pink fans, but for newcomers to her music. Maybe they should go to a song like Stupid Girls or Don't Let Me Get Me instead.\n\nSong: C 1\/2-","classification":3}

{"text":"There was a time, not too long ago, when the Rhino label was ridiculed because it wasted a lot of time and effort releasing oddities that nobody needed--triple-disc box sets from one-hit wonders and the like--but, for my money, Rhino has become one of the most important labels in the industry.\nThat's because they have turned their attention to saving some forgotten classics from the dustbin. And don't kid yourself for a second, though it may never have been heard on LP-format FM radio when it was released in a more abbreviated format in 1973 (though it is one of Franklin's best selling LPs), AMAZING GRACE is one of the absolute classics of it's time, a chunky R&B treatment of Gospel by thE Queen of Soul.\nAretha Franklin ranks with Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald as one of the all-time great American singers, and this CD showcases her amazing pipes in a perfect setting: piano, organ, a bit of drums and guitar, but mostly the power of Cleveland and the Southern California Community Choir carrying things along. The mix gives Franklin room to breathe and move. The result is one of the earthiest albums you'll ever hear.\n\"How I Got Over\" is a real Southern Baptist shouter, but it's the tunes that start off in a gentle slide that most clearly demonstrate Franklin's mastery: \"You'll Never Walk Alone,\" \"What A Friend We Have In Jesus,\" and \"Amazing Grace.\"\nThere's even a great instrumental, Baptized version of George Harrison's \"My Sweet Lord.\"\nThis is a tour de force which everyone should own, and one of my all-time favorite records.","classification":5}

All the songs on this album are great and some in particular will keep you thinking long after you hear them (Fancy Funeral, What If).

But that's not to say that the songs don't actually pack a punch.  Dee Dee's soft vocals contrast the distorted hiss and surf rock of guitars and bass that are built around each track.  She even covers an early Sonny Bono classic, \"Baby Don't Go.\"\n\nThe Dum Dum Girls have gained a loyal following since their last 2 records, so you can be sure that I'll review their new album, \"Too True\", very soon!  :)","classification":4}

{"text":"You know, there's a certain type of new music chart that needs to be created, and it would be based entirely upon the count of YouTube views that a given music video generates within its first few weeks of release -- with another chart (a derivative of the above) based strictly upon the velocity of weekly change. YouTube view counts, I have noticed, are something of a precursor for singles that break quickly -- the astonishing speeds that we see today on Billboard's Hot 100 for rising monster tracks are almost always indicated in advance by insanely large numbers of views at YouTube: Nicki Minaj, for example, has 52 Million views for Super Bass in a bit under 5 weeks (Billboard has the track at #5 inside of 5 weeks, too, which is incredible... especially considering that her prior single barely cracked the Top 15); Katy Perry has 40 Million views for Last Friday Night in 3 weeks (Billboard had Katy at #4 inside of those same 3 weeks on the big chart, which is also an incredible surge)... you get the idea. Gaga, Britney, Dev\/Cataracts, Adele, Jennifer Lopez, etc... all have shown this same early power at YouTube with their biggest -- and fastest-rising -- singles.\n\nWhat's my point...?\n\nIt's this:\n\nBritney's VEVO channel has the video for I Wanna Go at 14 Million views inside of a week. That implies a very quick ride to the top, but we'll see. A chart for YouTube views is badly needed -- my sample size is far too small, of course, to pronounce this as an obvious #1 title, although it certainly looks like this one is going to be a monster of a record. Jesus, they even clocked it dead at 3:30 -- what else can you ask for...?!! It's about as radio-friendly as a unit can get.\n\nI Wanna Go is probably the single best thing that Spears has ever put together, which isn't necessarily saying much. A much stronger single than \"Hold It Against Me\" or \"'till The World Ends,\" I really do wonder if labels are now holding back stronger singles ON PURPOSE. Traditionally, that would have been viewed as a mistake within the industry, but albums that ring-up multi-platinum numbers DO need that long-ish shelf-life, and in an age when ringtones (which can be as much as half of single sales) last barely a week for the average buyer within the market, creating the opportunity for that longer shelf-life may very well now REQUIRE the holding back of stronger tracks (for use as singles) deeper into the chart-life of the album. That would be a bizarre development within the industry -- and it would make monster albums much more rare.\n\nAgain, we'll see.\n\nBack the the point here, Britney (musically) almost seems to steal the drum track entirely from New Order's Blue Monday, with the stuttering hook coming straight out of Ke$ha's COMPLETE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO POP HOOKS FOR DUMMIES. A secondary hook is also in place here; Britney drags the E's out in the bridge-y Shame on me\/To need release\/Uncontrollably... and the whistling, too, could also be considered as a 3rd motif -- I'm probably alone is HATING the whistling; I'd have much preferred a keyboard... the whistling sounds far too demo-like for dance-pop, in my view. But hell, what do I know... she's gonna sell a boatload of this one -- I bet you she sells 3 Million ringtones from this ALONE, and probably by the end of the week, at that.\n\n3 stars.\n\nIt's okay.\n\nThe whistling is an ABOMINATION.\n\nA re-mix is badly needed.\n\nI have no doubt there will be many.","classification":3}

It represents Ric Ocasek's peak songwriting capabilities and does provide an opportunity for Eliot Easton to demonstrate his guitar skills.  It has that classic Cars sound--a quirky bridge between rock and new wave\n\nTo be clear the three-star rating I give this song is a good rating.

I own five of the songs on this album:  \"Let's Go\", \"It's All I Can Do\", \"Double Life\", \"Candy-O\" and \"Dangerous Type.\"\n\nIf you are trying to gauge my review, understand that I tend to prefer the Cars more rock-oriented songs, which are sometimes, but not always their most popular.  \"It's All I Can Do\" is definitely one of their more pop-oriented songs.

{"text":"I think the biggest improvement Mary J. has made during her last 2 albums is she has remained consistant.  You can now listen to her latest cds without skipping over tracks that interrupt the flow.  Aside from \"What's the 411\" and \"My Life\", her albums were littered with junk that were just plain unlistenable.  Of course every mary J. Blige album has at least a couple of good songs on it, but \"Breakthru\" and \"Growing Pains\" are a complete journey you can play from start to finish.  I don't really like the title of the album though, \"Growing Pains\" reminds me too much of the old 80's tv show and it sounds too harsh like \"groin pains\".  I love the cover of the cd.  I love Mary's pose, it looks retro and Egyptian and she's also laying on a bunch of records which is great for me becuz I used to dj. You go with the shout out to vinyl, Mary. As for the songs on the cd, I love \"Work That\", I could listen to this song a million times, \"Just Fine\", \"Roses\", and \"Til The Mornin'\" are other standouts for me.  \"What Love Is\" and \"Fade Away\" are some of my all time faves from Mary J. \"Fade Away\" sounds a little alternative like Depeche Mode sounding, the background music is moody and deep. Towards the end of the cd, some of the songs go in that direction which is strange considering her R and B roots.  It's unique and groundbreaking, giving her music a fresh sound while remaining innovative.  The only song which doesn't do it for me is \"Grown Woman\".  It's not exactly groundbreaking material, the rap thing is so dated and played out at this point. My favourite lyric on the album where Mary really hits you with it is on \"Roses\". \"Sometimes I need a hug!\"  Who doesn't.  Thanks for breaking it down Mary.","classification":5}

{"text":"The final American album from Johnny Cash isn't his strongest, but it's one of his most memorable. It's not his strongest because he wasn't feeling his strongest. These songs were recorded just weeks and months before his passing. His whispers are haunting though, on tracks like \"Ain't No Grave,\" because he obviously understands that his life is coming to an end.\n\nI'm not familiar with a lot of these songs, and to be honest, I wish there were more songs here for Johnny to sing. I don't think his version of \"Aloha Oe\" will be remembered as one of his greatest recordings ever, so the album feels a little too light, but maybe that's the point.\n\nIf you are a fan of Johnny Cash's American recordings, I recommend listening to the album, and if you are thrilled by what you hear, then buy the album. If you are new to Johnny's music, I would start somewhere else.","classification":3}

{"text":"First, a point of reference.  When this was originally released, this was the only compilation of late '60's Beatles songs available.  Perfect for the 8-track player and listening to in the car on long trips.  Plus, this had the version of \"Let It Be\" with a different guitar solo than the LP version.  All the songs here were played on the radio extensively (OK, maybe not \"Old Brown Shoe\") and that's why this was essential back in the day.  Now?  Maybe not, with all the CD's released since 1987.  Back in the day, it was hard to find some people who did not like the Beatles.  I find it interesting to read the negative comments of Beatles and Stones CD's to see if I have been wrong all these years.  I am glad that many young people (those born 1980 or later) have embraced the Beatles for the musical legacy they left us.  For those who just don't like them, well, that's their opinion and that keeps things interesting if you truly in fact do not like the music.\nAs for reviewing this CD, all the songs are great.  Not a bad one here.  Should be familiar to all Beatles fans.  This set (along with the Red Album) is a fine introduction for someone new to rock music.  Could some extra tracks have been added?  Of course.  But look at what happened with the releases of the 87 CDs.  I guess Capitol did not want to tinker with the original product.  So, for those from back in the day, or someone looking for a set of songs to keep in the car for listening, this does the trick.  Hopefully this will encourage new listeners to further explore the works of John, Paul, George and Ringo, and bring a smile to the faces of those of us who were there back in the day.","classification":5}

{"text":"Ryan Leslie released \"Transition\", the follow-up to his self-titled debut. On his first album, he was heavily inspired by the sounds of the 80's. Now, on his new album while his songwriting has improved, other things have not. He has tried to establish a distinctive sound on his debut as well as Cassie's album, which he wrote and produced. Throughout \"Transition\", he has a tendency to get a little nerdy- excuse me, a little N.E.R.D.-y. It's almost as if The Neptunes were overseeing this project the way that it sounds. Not helping is the song \"Something That I Like\" which features Pusha T of the Clipse, who are The Neptunes' longtime collaborators. \"You're Not My Girl\", \"Zodiac\" and \"Sunday Night\" sound as if Ryan owes Chad and Pharrell some royalty checks. I chalk this album up to being a rush job since it was released nine months after his debut, and while I like the album, I thought it was uninspired for the most part.","classification":4}
{"text":"Since I grew up playing piano and love playing Bach and listening to Bach music, this is by far my favorite piece. And I was over the moon when I found this piece of music FREE in Amazon.\nFor best listening and to be able to hear the high and low notes and the overall depth in sound, I use a very high quality Bluetooth headset. This way, the music sounds more true to a live orchestra like setting in a theater. In addition, I can walk around with my wireless headset on and enjoy this magnificent music!\n\nIf you are a classical music person, let me suggest this recording. It is OUTSTANDING, and so beautiful as well as relaxing.

With that being said, the fact that I am giving Tom Sawyer five stars says something. This is a great song with a spectacular rock introduction and perfectly matched vocals. I will go so far as to say it is essential to any comprehensive Rock N' Roll collection. Rush is very much into Progressive Rock but you don't have to be into Progressive Rock to appreciate Tom Sawyer. It is carefully constructed with just the right number of minor key chords to give it an amazing sound. Good Stuff.","classification":5}
{"text":"You + Me is a great side project for P!nk & Dallas Green.  The opener, \"Capsized,\" is the strongest track with a driving beat and a memorable melody, \"We were two ships in the night, hell bent on trying to survive.\"  Many of the other tracks are lovely folk music like \"From a Closet in Norway (Oslo Blues)\" with its beautiful melody and the gorgeous harmonies.  \"Love Gone Wrong\" starts with a dazzling vocal by Dallas Green on a melody dipping slightly towards blues joined by Alecia Moore's strong vocals, \"I'm gone for good.\"  \"Break the Cycle\" has a bigger sound with a stop-start melody as the piano lingers in the air before the vocals interrupt, \"Tell me the words you long to hear & I'll sing them loud & clear; Let me heal the wounds you've held on to for all these years.\"  \"Open Door\" is stripped down with a lovely melody and Matt Kelly's pedal steel guitar.  \"Rose Ave.\" is obviously a labor of love, performed with passion, well worth your ear.

{"text":"Other than maybe a change in a line or two, this is one of my favorite singles from the early 2000's. Especially the bass and guitar fueled chorus that thunders like a concrete tsunami descending on a trailer park. The simplistic pile driven vocals each come in like 500 lb bunker busters. Its an opus to social discord, the alienated and disenfranchised, rage and retribution. I don't condone violence, but yet like the vocalist unwinding the story, there's something darkly inspiring and powerful to see one so downtrodden and beaten into non-existence finally rise up and lash out at those that drove them to where they are, and left not even a corner for them to crouch in. As already stated, I don't condone violence, but every once in a while something tragic happens, and you can't help but feel like it was honestly earned. This song encapsulates all of that for me.","classification":5}

And to Katy's credit she wrote the song on her own.\n\nThe song talks about a lover who has come to pass and how even though Katy's with some other guy, all she does is think of the better dude (her first love).\n\nThis is a ballad of sorts, and a good one at that. In the video, Katy goes from the \"summer girl\" having fun, to the lover in the room being caressed by her current flame and finally to the \"widow\" at the end, with the slick, laced up heels.\n\nHer best song so far for a mile.\n\nNow if only Katy Perry would take some serious voice lessons because her voice is too raw. That's my only complaint about this otherwise stunning song.\n\n4 stars.","classification":4}

{"text":"I'll try to keep this fairly short by starting with I'm a longtime fan of the Chemical Bros. and love albums like \"Exit Planet Dust\" Bros Gonna Work It Out Mixtape\", \"Dig YOur Own HOle\", and \"Surrender\" (an under-appreciated classic I think), and that singles collection double-disc was fantastic. There have been a few albums in recent years here and there that haven't really grabbed me the way those albums that I just listed did but those albums always had their redeeming songs. Anyways what I'm saying is this is the first Chemical Brothers album I've heard in many years since Surrender that really just blew me away. It truly is innovative and is programmed, written, and executed brilliantly here. Born In Echoes never loses their trademark sound but still stays true to trying new areas and the Beck collab is just mindblowing. Really there isn't anything bad I can say about this album. If you liked the albums I listed in this review and like the Bros. then this is highly recommended. Anyone who likes electronic music should give it a shot at least once I think.","classification":5}

But there can be times where one great artist, can sometimes have a song or two feel like it has lost its fighting spirit on the singer, and the listener. Blank Space, the second single off of Taylor Swift album 1989, actually is catchy, but not over the top with fighting on love. The song is good, but sounds similar to the tried and true sound of her song I Knew You Were Trouble and We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together from her Red album. The song also isn't as strong or catchy as was the case with Shake It Off at heart. Still, it is a song that isn't bad, but not really one of her better songs. Hopefully, there is better from Taylor down the road, that can be love than just a blank space left unfilled.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3}

{"text":"It wasn't easy for me to give in and replace my homemade Keystone box set, painstakingly assembled many moons ago--so that I could listen to these shows in their entirety--by re-sequencing the tracklist and burning onto CD-Rs the four previous releases (plus bootleg) that featured highlights of these two July 1973 Berkeley shows. But after hearing the pristine remastered sound that came out of my speakers while listening to 'Keystone Companions,' I'll now gladly set fire to my old one as an offering to the music gods, in thanks for this excellent release, even though in the back of my mind I'll secretly be thinking, \"What took so dang long?\"\n\nBut that's neither here nor there, as it's here now, and captures Jerry at (arguably) the peak of his improvisational powers. There's no stronger evidence than listening to songs like the jammy, hypnotic \"Merl's Tune,\" the straight-up blues of \"Hi-Heel Sneakers,\" and especially the band's insanely tripped-out take on the jazz standard \"My Funny Valentine,\" which contains some near-supernatural psychic interplay between Jerry, Merl, John Kahn, and Bill Vitt. Merl weaves his keyboard melodies tightly in and around Jerry's guitar leads as if the two have been playing together regularly for a decade, and the rhythm section is precise and on-point, even during the various sudden changes in tempo throughout.\n\nElsewhere we get: two Dylan covers that certainly do justice to the originals, with David Grisman's peerless mandolin playing making an appearance on \"Positively 4th Street\"; the Motown classics \"I Second That Emotion\" and \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You),\" both featuring heartfelt, soulful vocals from Jerry; the reggae bounce of Jimmy Cliff's infectious \"The Harder They Come,\" which is nearly impossible to sit through without bobbing your grinning head up and down...I could go on, but it would probably be way less boring for you to simply check it out for yourself.\n\n'Keystone Companions: The Complete 1973 Fantasy Recordings' is, imo, the most essential Dead-related archival release in quite a while, and it's been a long time coming. I'm just thankful that I no longer have to deal with my shoddy-sounding self-assembled version, and can now listen comfortably, without worrying about sudden volume increases blasting my eardrums due to the combining of differently mastered albums. But for even the more casual, less obsessive Jerry fan--or Merl fan--this is one release that I can almost guarantee will not be coming out of your rotation for a long time, and will most likely make return appearances for many years to come. The music here is timeless, with Jerry and Merl putting their stamp on some of the 20th century's most beloved classics.\n\nWhat more could you possibly ask for?\n\n{But if you need further convincing, apart from the fact that you get four hours of prime Jerry and co. with crystal clear sound, an hour of which is previously unreleased, just know that the set also includes a booklet with nice photos (and nice smell, always a plus), informative liner notes from Grateful Dead authority David Gans, a snazzy poster, a button, a coaster, and a \"scratchbook\" that replicates the promotional matchbooks for the original 1973 'Keystone' double album.}","classification":5}

I'm thinking Echo and the Bunnymen meet Woody Guthrie and Stray Cats. This is very infectious music that along with a bit of repetition in musical lines, grows on you and invites you to replay.\n\nReally enjoyable without pretense of deep themes, but nicely put together and, I think, unique.","classification":4}

{"text":"Jennifer Nettles, Kristen Hall, and Kristian Bush are \"Sugarland,\" and this debut album by the trio is a solid beginning to their career as such.  However, all three of them have had careers long before this.  Nettles fronted her own band.  Hall gained respect for her writing skills and Bush was part of Billy Pilgrim.  As of this writing, Hall has already departed from the trio.  Who knows what that will lead to in the future.\n\nAs for this disc, Sugarland knows how to craft music that is rather appealing to a mass audience.  They meld traditional country, folk rock and pop to make a sound that fits comfortably somewhere between Kenny Chesney's fluff and Allison Krause's commercial bluegrass.  The first three singles from this album, \"Baby Girl,\" \"Something More,\" and \"Just Might(Make Me Believe)\" ring true of contemporary pop country, but songs like the title track and \"Small Town Jericho\" show that this group does have a little more weight to them than most johnny-come-lately's.\n\nThe only song that I have a problem with is \"Down In Mississippi.\"  It's an attempt at a barn-burner that wants to sound like Southern rock but fails to satisfy.  Nettles' voice comes across as forced, and the song just feels out of place from the rest of the album.  If this trio has any shortcomings, it's that their sound is too tight to sound tough.\n\nGive this album a chance if you enjoy female vocalists or tight harmonies in the Diamond Rio vein.  Also, if you're a fan of commercially cranked out country like Rascal Flatts, this album has plenty of that too.","classification":4}

If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button (triangle).\n\nOr, if you just want to build up your music collection the starving-college-student way, Amazon offers a ton of FREE music downloads.

Gottschalk wasn't strictly a rag composer, in fact, he predates them by nearly half a century. But like Joplin &c, Gottschalk was a piano-centered composer who combined classical and popular styles, while encorporating flavorful regional folk elements into his music--so to my ears, he fits right in.\n\nAt the price, there's no reason not to scoop up this delicious treat, almost like a triple-dipper ice cream cone of your favorite flavors, for 99 cents.","classification":5}

{"text":"Javier's self-titled debut CD is a smoothly executed and immaculately produced old-school R&B gem that is obviously influenced by Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway with a little Brian McKnight thrown in. Although I really love this release and it has received very positive reviews here, I am writing mine to further support Javier as I just read a couple reviews from well known reviewers that not only slammed Javier for sounding like Brian McKnight lite, but also took the opportunity to slam Brian McKnight. Cheap shot on both counts.\nIn my opinion, this is one of 2003s very best releases from a confident new talent who is following his muse and not jumping on the much too crowded neo-soul bandwagon or relying on hip-hop and collaborations with rappers to sell CDs. Keep in mind that I have no issue with any of the aforementioned genres, but cant a young black man be allowed (and even commended) for sticking to his guns as he is the real thing not the creation of some producer. Some critics may not know that Javier not only did his time in a jam R & B band, is also a multi-instrument virtuoso, and served as co-writer on all the songs on his album, a rarity in the world of contemporary R&B.\nWhat about the record you ask? Some of you may have heard the first single title Crazy, which in my mind is also one of 2003s best. Its got a Stevie Wonder vibe, a chorus from heaven, and some hooks that make it. \"Song For Your Tears\" is one of my favorites combining wah-wah guitars and classical piano with Philly soul orchestration and some Stevie Ray Vaughn blues to produce a lush masterpiece. Here Javier sounds like a seasoned pro.  Hey Little Sister has a contagious Roots-crafter percussion which makes the song move and seasons Javiers infectious falsetto and song runs. Although Biggest Mistake has a boy-band ballad feel to it, its still a great song that makes it an instant classic.\nAuthentic Latin flourish spices tracks like \"Can't Have My Heart\" and \"She Spoke To Me,\" are peppered with Latin influences, which is not surprising as Javier's father owned a Spanish-language radio station  and Latin music was a constant presence in Javier's family household growing up. The former sounds a little too much like Brian McKnights Back At One, but its still great. The latter is pure Javier which to me sounds a little like a contemporary Stevie. Not a parody or an imitation, just the voice and song selection is definitively more Stevie than Nas or 50 Cent. I love the guitar work and the sexy images that the song evokes. Think of a midnight dance under a full moon in a tropical island and youll get an idea of how great She Spoke To Me is and why its another of my favorites. In Your Hands showcases Javiers voice and songwriting strength. Shell Never Know also hits the spot with his pleading beat and sense of romantic loss.\nThe most magical song on the CD is saved for last. October Sky takes an entirely new direction with a jazzy late night feel that  has Javier sounding like a troubadour from the 1930s (with a detour at Stevie Wonders house) who somehow wound up in a modern day bar. I hope that this song is a window of things to come. Dont turn off your CD after the song ends as it picks up again in an organic feel that could also be the basis for what lies ahead for Javier.\n\nAll in all this is an outstanding debut that is solidly based on old school R&B, but spiced by jazz, rock, funk, and Latin grooves. There are only a couple of songs (Beautiful U R, Slow Motion) that are not as strong as the rest and sound a little too much like other crooners who specialize in mid-tempo songs. Even those songs are head and shoulders above the rest of what passes for R & B these days. While at first listen I can see why some may see Javiers debut as a poor mans Brian McKight, if you really listen to the music, there is no doubt that Javier is his own man and easily earns the 4 stars that I am giving it. It would have been 5 stars if the aforementioned mid tempo songs had been replaced by songs in the vein of \"October Sky\"","classification":4}

{"text":"If you're a casual fan looking for more than what \"1\" gives you, this is pretty much your only other collection option. It's also basically the later part of the earlier set \"1962-1966\", and the two 2-disc collections obviously go together well. Each disc here is roughly 50 minutes, and while it could hold many more songs, you still get 28 classics here. Even without the \"62-66\" set this is more than what's on \"1\", though short their early work. This also gives numerous tracks off each album, including both \"Sgt Peppers\" and \"The Beatles (White Album)\". Plus of course the hits from \"Abbey Road\", \"Magical Mystery Tour\", \"Let It Be\", and other singles. Anybody could add more or different songs to this, but it's really hard to complain when the music is this good. Again, for the casual fan, this 1967-70 (blue set) is almost a must to get with the 62-66 (red set). Oh, and I heard their proper albums are pretty good too. Enjoy.","classification":5}

{"text":"High powered romantic revivalist Michael Ponti represents Rachmaninoff's fiendishly difficult piano music brilliantly. While listening to him, I was thinking he probably wouldn't do as well with Mozart (but I could be surprised - don't know), and indeed after looking into his discography, I can't see that he has recorded very much written before the 19th century. But his mind and fingers are programmed to zone into the great Romantic composers, and this survey of Rachmaninoff is truly some great stuff. The sonics are a bit uneven, but overall are acceptable. Highly recommended!","classification":5}

{"text":"Over the years I have written ad nauseam about how great it was to be a teen in the 1960's. Top 40 radio was at its peak in those days and I was glued to my radio for the Top 40 Countdown each and every week! For a few years during the mid-sixties a blued-eyed soul quartet from New York City ran up an impressive string of hit records. Felix Cavaliere, Dino Danelli, Eddie Brigati and Gene Cornish formed the Young Rascals back in 1964. Rock and roll afficianados might recall that all except Danelli had been members of Joey Dee's Starlighters who had several hit records in the early 1960's including the #1 smash \"Peppermint Twist\" in 1961. This talented new group was soon making lots of noise in the New York City area and several labels were interested in signing them. It was Atlantic that had the great good fortune to sign The Young Rascals in 1965 and just a few months later The Young Rascals released their very first single.\n\nI have to say that I liked just about every single The Rascals ever released. They were great pop records.  In 1967 Atlantic released How Can I Be Sure.  This was the group's highest charted record with Eddie Brigati singing lead. The song peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was something of a departure from The Rascals standard fare.  This is probably the most beautiful tune the group ever recorded.","classification":5}

{"text":"First I have to thank MIGHTY AMAZON for announcing the reissue of this splendid album on a fully remastered compact disc. I've been yearning for it for years...I purchased it the instant I was notified!.\nOverall the project is well written,arranged and produced,it's just like a zepher,a cool eveling wind. Without a doubt, this is MAJOR HARRIS greatest effort!.The songs here has truly stand the rugged test of time itself and are as new as if released yesterday!!!.\nThis soothing effort starts with the light,bouncy yet regretful \"EACH MORNING I WAKE UP\". The ultimate song here,my most favorite, is the steamy, highly erotic and most sensual \"LOVE WONT LET ME WAIT\"!!!.The yearning, the pleading, the desperation,and the reaction is as real as it can ever be. The orgasmic moans\/screams by BARBARA INGRAM is as vivid as ever!!!. She is literally writhing\/ranting in heat\/ecstasy, nothing is left to imagine. This is surely one of the greatest lovemaking songs ever recorded!!!.\nNext is the airy \"SWEET TOMORROW\" and the most sad \"SIDESHOW\",originally done by the soul group BLUE MAGIC. \"TWO WRONGS\" bouncy yet regretful. Next is the hopeful \"LOVING YOU IS MELLOW\" a favorite. \"JUST A THING I DO\" is poetry in motion, I love this work of art as well. \"AFTER LOVING YOU\" is an expression of long lost love, lively yet a tad sad. Concluding this supreme effort is his remake of the classic \"MY WAY\", with his soothing tenor voice, he makes this song his very own. I recommend this one-of-a-kind record to all fans of true soul music...A dose of life itself...You will agree as you listen...A most worthy addition to your private stock...A true treasure indeed...","classification":5}

Amazing music!","classification":5}
{"text":"I can't give this album a full 5 stars, but it's close, and certainly a classic of its type.  Not many artists could pull off a rather loose \"jam\" session and have it hold up as well as this has.  It just shows how much class and talent Al Kooper has.  Tough enough, but how about when Mike Bloomfield fails to show on the 2nd day of the sessions, and Al has to recruit Steve Stills at literally the last minute.  All things considered, it's amazing that this album even saw the light of day, much less that it is considered a sort of classic of its type.\n\nBut let's explore that.  Among jazz musicians, jam sessions are quite normal, but it's usually a bit different for rock musicians.  In this case, Al was as much of a jazz afficiando as he was blues, soul and rock, so he probably relished the idea to get Bloomfield and a good rhythm section, a couple of tunes he and Mike wanted to cover, and see what would happen.  They did exactly that (at least for one day) and the results are pretty impressive.  There are a few miscues: The phasing on \"You Don't Love Me\" is very dated and gets annoying quickly.\n\nBut still, if you can overlook the quirks and the obvious holes that are inevitably going to be there, there is a great spirit to this set.  Sometimes living dangerously brings out what playing it safe could never get you, and I think that's what happens here.  The adventure outweighs the lack of preparation, and the results are a truly unique listening experience.","classification":4}

Billy Joel on \"Wichita Lineman\" sounds very unlike he does on his solo work but is excellent. Michael McDonald is simply the consummate harmony and backing vocalist he has always been and his contribution is priceless.  Vince Gill adds icing to the cake on \"Oklahoma Nights\" with his great vocals and guitar work.  Lucinda Williams brings the mood that Webb intended when he wrote Galveston that brings chills to the listener. Jackson Browne is a great choice for PF Sloan with its political message and smooth country rock vibe. Glenn Campbell on \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" is hauntingly touching.

{"text":"While Herbert Von Karajan was known mostly as a conductor whose bent was the Austro-German repertoire, I've always thought that Karajan was as good (and sometimes better) in the French and Russian repertoire.\n\nWhile there are many outstanding renditions of Debussy's \"La Mer\" by the likes of Charles Munch, Arturo Toscanini, Pierre Boulez and others; Karajan certainly seems to hold his own, in a fine and very well polished reading that falls just a little bit short in terms of not fully capturing the essence of Debussy's dream-like quality.  Likewise, while a shiny and well-formed \"Pictures at an Exhibition\" seems to be good enough, there are other recordings of \"Pictures\" (i.e. Bernstein\/NYPO) that seem to shine brighter and probe deeper.\n\nAs for Karajan's recording of Ravel's \"Bolero\"; it is excellent; perhaps even better than Karajan himself intended it to be. Something must have been right on the day that this recording of \"Bolero\" was made where the Berlin Philharmonic happened to put together a wonderful recording that fully captures a very raw feeling of intensity despite the fact that the music is all polished and waxed in typical Karajan fashion. It is indeed an irony that while Karajan worked hard to perfect his Beethoven, Brahms and Tchaikovsky, with as many as four or five recordings of the same pieces throughout his lengthy career, that he was able to pull off an ideal \"Bolero\" in one shot.\n\nAll-in-all, four stars each for \"La Mer\" and \"Pictures\"; five for \"Bolero\".","classification":5}

{"text":"I really don't get all the hate directed at Nickelback.  I've heard that they're an obnoxious, repetitive band, that they've supposedly \"sold out\" artistically, and lead vocalist Chad Kroeger apparently gets flak for dating\/marrying Avril Lavigne (what, celebrities aren't allowed to marry each other?).  I couldn't judge myself, as I hadn't listened to their music, so when I discovered that one of my favorite songs (on a mix CD given to me by a friend) happened to be a Nickelback song, I was a little surprised.  This song was by the much-hated band?  If this was an example of their usual work, why all the hatred?\n\nI don't know if \"Hero\" is typical of all Nickelback's work or not, but it's a powerful song that gets me in the gut whenever I hear it.\n\n\"Hero\" is a rock number that first appeared on the \"Spiderman\" soundtrack, which is befitting.  It's a strong song about the difficulties of being a hero, and being strong in the face of adversity.  It's accompanied by a powerful guitar section, with my only nitpick being that the drum section can sometimes overpower the other instruments.  And it does have a soft, melancholy acoustic interlude that gives the listener a slight break from the heavier guitars.\n\nIf this is an example of all Nickelback's work, then I'm going to give the rest of the band's discography a shot.  If it's not their typical work... well, then at least there's one Nickelback song I really like.","classification":5}

{"text":"There are few music artists who reliably and consistently put out excellent albums, one after the other. In hip hop, Compton, California instrumentalist, producer, disc jockey, and rapper DJ Quik is one of those continuously exceptional artists who is legendary to his coast and hip hop as a whole. Producing and rapping since the eighties and playing instruments since a child, Quik, or David Blake, has assembled some of the most gorgeous funk and soul beats of all time and has always been an interesting emcee on the mic. He has worked with many figures in the biz from Tupac, Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube to his frequently recurring collaborators, AMG, 2nd II None, Hi-C, El DeBarge, Suga Free, and Playa Hamm, some of whom appear on Quik's ninth solo album, The Midnight Life. Quik of course infuses his signature funk and soul into the album but puts a different twist on them just for this collection of songs. Cool, original guitar, piano, and horns with strong drums and claps are layered upon each other for a rich, voluptuous audio experience from start to finish. Quik has added some talk boxing, an unusual instrument (by hip hop standards) in the second track, and a jaw dropping concept beat in \"Trapped On The Tracks.\" His lyrics are again stimulating and diverse with rhymes, and in addition to the familiar guests are some new ones, Bishop Lamont, David Blake II, and Dom Kennedy. Quik runs the gamut of speaking topics from personal philosophy to natural social phenomena, but his main aim is to have a great time in the musical process. Amongst his various talking points, he hits upon the mark he has made on the game, the beauty of living fly, his seniority in hip hop, just deserts for promiscuous women, and relationship communication. DJ Quik has such appealing, easily identifiable style and flavor that are unique enough so as to require little maintenance over time except for the necessary experimentation for freshness and modern day relevancy. He has put all those things in The Midnight Life, so the new dawn for the Compton raised, music virtuoso looks very bright.","classification":4}

You might not cut up the floor like a maniac, this musical scrawl doesnt have that type of zip or sharp angles, but youll probably still celebrate some 80s moves.  I cant say that I really like this though because its too overproduced and singer\/ songwriter Angelekos voice is too high and electronically altered or distorted throughout so it doesnt betray any emotional vulnerabilities, and yet the lyrics seem to be full of them.  I guess a better way to put it is that the music catches my ears but after a while makes me shrug my shoulders as the vocals and vocal effects, with all their sugar, end up distracting me so that I don't care about anything more than the sound.  But like I said earlier, the sound doesnt have that zip or those sharp angles so to quote My Brother Taught Me How To SwimI got lost! and began to tune out.

But in the 1980s Bobby Brown had a monstrously huge album or two that contained R&B\/Pop tunes that have so far withstood the test of time. Rock WitCha is a song with a tremendously catchy beat and melody that persists with the listener ALL DAY LONG (In my best Bobby Brown voice). The catchiness of the song distracts the listener from the somewhat disturbing implications of the song lyrics.

Some songs are more industrial and faster similar to other NIN songs. Some of them are also slower, more unique and atmospheric.

It was the group's signature song, their first #1 hit single and still remains their most popular song ever.\n\nThe Highwayman tells the story of death and rebirth in four parts, and each part is sung by a different member of the group. The first three characters (Willie, Kris, Waylon) meet their deaths and are somehow resurrected. Johnny's character has already left his former life and is in the process of being reincarnated. His character may also represent all of The Highwaymen.\n\nOr all of us...\n\nWillie:\n\nI was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride\nWith sword and pistol by my side\nMany a young maid lost her baubles to my trade\nMany a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade\nThe bas***ds hung me in the spring of '25\nBut I am still alive\n\nKris:\n\nI was a sailor. I was born upon the tide\nWith the sea I did abide\nI sailed a schooner around the Horn to Mexico\nI went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow\nAnd when the yards broke off they said that I got killed\nBut I am living still\n\nWaylon:\n\nI was a dam builder. Across the river deep and wide\nWhere steel and water did collide\nA place called Boulder on the wild Colorado\nI slipped and fell to the wet concrete below\nThey buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound\nBut I am still around...I'll always be around\n\nJohnny:\n\nI fly a starship across the Universe divide\nAnd when I reach the other side\nI'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can\nPerhaps I may become a Highwayman again\nOr I may simply be a single drop of rain\nBut I will remain\n\nAnd I'll be back again...","classification":5}

This is a breath of fresh air to rap especially with weak female albums; Lil KIm's \"Notorius Kim\", Da Brat's \"Unrestricted\", Trina's \"The Baddest\", Angie Martinez's album and especially Amil's and Queen Pen's garbage albums.  This album establishes the fact that the more a REAL MCee raps, the better the lyric becomes and when you add emotion and confidence you will become unstoppable. This is the best Cd that has ever come from her. The first single \"Bk Anthem\" jumped it off but in actuality it jumped off with that \"Bang, Bang\" flow. In which Lil kim was put in her place. Then she drops \"Oh Yeah\" with Spragga Benz which is a hype track. It just keeps flowing on and on with this album from \"730\" to \"Hood Scriptures\" (which has the most creative sound I have heard in a while) to Table will turn and so on. So all you [...] Lil kim fans you heard the answers to kim's weak flow on  notorious kim. Now realize this cd is so close to a classic that it is sick. This is one of the best of the year so far. Much success to Foxy and def Jam. She joins the list with Remi,Rah and Eve as being the best female Mcees out now, with much respect to Jean Grey and Apani B. This Cd is tight.

Yes, he mentions about wanting his sexual conquest to go down on him (with the lyrics \"to be a star you have to go down\").

This is a love song from Lady Gaga to a guy she wants to mount and thrash her, but the pun, which refers to her as a guy, makes no sense. As far as casual listeners, unaware of the conceptual specifics, are concerned, she wants to be a male. Past penis rumors suggest that might actually be the case.\n\nShe sounds like a female though. Unfortunately her voice is never laid atop any pleasurable melodies. The chorus, sang over bombastic synth sounds, is ironically weak. Despite whats promised on the starting monologue, the song doesnt offer anything particularly new or exciting, unless, of course, you happen to be Lady Gaga or the gentleman shes singing to.\n\nmarcellee.com","classification":3}

{"text":"What got me caught on this song was hearing a remake from the Webb Brothers. The remake took the best aspects of the song and gave it a updated polish. All that means is the original, while sounding dated, still holds both a unique and familiar feel to it. The song has two different parts to it. These parts are completely different from each other in just about all things. The feel, groove and even time signature are different. The first part is very much a forward moving and brooding feel to it reminiscent of the old western films. The other part switches to a 3\/4 time signature with Nancy Sinatra singing softly about nature. Both sides seem to switch back in forth in either a dance or a duo between each other. Kind of a one side masculine and one feminine.\n\nMuch has been said about the meaning of the song and lyrics. The obvious is one part is a man who was influenced by somebody named Phaedra, and the other is Phaedra herself speaking of what she is all about. Is it all about romance? Is it about evolving to a higher sense of being? Is it just about sex? I found no definitive answers out there. I like to think it's about redemption given to somebody hardened by life by one who is at one with her surroundings.\n\nIt's such a simple song yet it is filled with complexity not just in lyrics but musically as well. It's been covered many times, but I find going back to the original keeps me in touch with just how beautiful the song is in both its darker and warmer tones. If you like 60's psychedelic music they don't get much better than this.","classification":4}

{"text":"There is truly a lot to love in this set of (mostly) great Beethoven recordings. I can certainly sympathize with the previous reviewer, and to a large extent share his disgruntlement at great works of music being sliced and diced into a hodgepodge of \"greatest hits\" and \"selected movements\". However, I believe there is plenty of baby in the bathwater of this collection, and at its current ridiculously low price of a dollar there is no reason at all not to snap it up.\n\nListeners who have bought collections of Beethoven music by the X5 Music Group will find some duplication here (for more on the X5 connection, see the last paragraph of this review). But even for those people -- including myself -- there are a few real gems. I list a few highlights below -- all of them complete works. I shall ignore the stray movements that have been lifted out of various works, even though these also include some fine recordings of great music.\n\nFirst, I was won over by the sparkling performance of Brazilian pianist Christina Ortiz on Piano Concerto No. 5, which starts out the set. A former winner of the Van Cliburn competition, Ortiz puts in a really memorable performance with spirited accompaniment from the orchestra.\n\nSecond, the recording of Symphony No. 3 featured here is one of the finest ever made. Don't let the un-modern sound fool you. A lot of people, myself included, think this is the finest recording ever made of the Eroica by Wilhelm Furtwangler. In turn, a lot of people still see Furtwangler as the best Beethoven conductor of the 20th century -- even if his life is still bogged down in controversy over his decision to stay in Germany under the Nazis, rather than fleeing to the US or UK. This mono recording from a live concert by the Berlin Philharmonic on December 8, 1952 may not be up to modern technical standards, but it burns with energy and expression you'll be hard pressed to find anyone beat today. The inclusion of Furtwangler conducting the Berliners on his own arrangement of the \"Grosse Fuge\" (originally for string quartet) is a great bonus.\n\nThird is a perhaps surprisingly beautiful rendition of one of the most seldom-heard of Beethoven's great large-scale works, the Mass in C Minor, by a Slovenian TV ensemble. (I especially liked the rich tone of the bass-baritone vocal soloist.) Often overshadowed by the grander \"Missa Solemnis\", also featured here in a quite good performance by a German radio orchestra, the Mass in C Minor is an earlier work that may be closer to Mozart and the classical era in style but which packs a powerful emotional punch.\n\nFourth comes a long list of fine performances of many other complete works that, even if they will not make any \"short lists\" of the greatest recordings in history, are highly competent and enjoyable readings. For example, I love seeing youth orchestras getting exposure, and Piano Concerto No. 2 pairs up the Munich Youth Orchestra with a more seasoned pro as soloist. Besides Furtwangler's Symphony No. 3, integral and listenable performances of Symphonies No. 2, 4-5, and 7-8 are here. Seven of Beethoven's 10 violin sonatas are featured -- six of them from a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/truly-pleasant-collection-of-concert-recordings-by-Emmy-Verhey-and-Carlos-Moerdijk\/dp\/B001N9B6DM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">truly pleasant collection of concert recordings by Emmy Verhey and Carlos Moerdijk<\/a>&nbsp;and the famous \"Spring\" sonata coming through in a sunny rendition by Nora Chastain. Also some wonderful chamber music like the Wind Octet, a Trio for Clarinet, Bassoon and Piano, and a Piano Quintet.\n\nThe news is not all good, however. The compilers committed an almost unforgivable sin by mixing and matching two different performances of the Violin Concerto -- a generic, run-of-the-mill recording of the first two movements by a Dubrovnik outfit and an unnamed soloist, followed by a stellar third movement featuring soloist Christian Tetzlaff. I think it's just terrible to create this kind of a Frankenstein-like whole out of parts that were never meant to go together. They do the same mix-and-match job again with two performances of the music to Beethoven's only ballet, \"The Creatures of Prometheus\". Shame on X5\/Mungo.\n\nSimilarly, including the first two movements of the \"Appasionada\" piano sonata and leaving off the third was also just in poor taste.\n\nOn the technical side, bitrates are variable and clock in at an average of 208-278 kbps. Total download size for those foolhardy enough is 1.85 GB for 17.7 hours of music.\n\nAs promised above, now a little background for those interested in the business end, which I always find fascinating. I found out about this new series of \"111 Amazing...\" sets from an ad on Facebook from Sweden's X5 Music Group, which also brought us the \"99 Most Essential...\" and \"100 Supreme Classical Masters...\" series. X5 was originally listed as copyright holder on many of these \"111 Amazing\" collections, but now all traces of X5 involvement have disappeared (although the original listings are still visible in a Google search as of today). It seems likely that \"Mungo Records\", which has put out a whole series of these \"111\" sets, is really just a new imprint of X5. Nothing wrong with that, but strange that they seem to want to hide it so badly.\n\nOverall, if you are new to Beethoven or classical music, just get it. If you have a deep collection already, pick it up for the handful of gems -- Ortiz is well worth hearing, and if you don't have Furtwangler's December 1952 Eroica now is your chance.","classification":4}

{"text":"I always felt that Emily were the \"brains\" and Martie were the \"fire\" in the Dixie Chicks and this new project confirms it as they take more control of their careers and creativity. This album is more intimate, emotional, and powerful (yet simple) than anything the Chicks ever put out. Despite the seriousness of this album, I suspect this album was made for \"fun\". I don't think they are expecting this album to sell like the Chicks album, but this side project is allowing them to blow off steam and be honest with themselves. The songs do not have a \"beat\" and it might take several listenings to get into the album because folk-based music is not the norm days. The best songs on this album (IMO) are \"Skyline\", \"The Coast\", \"Delight (Something New Under the Sun)\", \"Ain't No Son\", \"Gracefully\" and my favorite \"See You in the Spring\" (featuring Jakob Dylan), which talks about a long distance relationship between a Northern man and a Southern woman. The song is so powerful with its wonderful use of metaphors and similes. It reminded me of a relationship I had with a New York man. The ladies, along with Jakob, pretty much told the story of our relationship.\n\nThe funny thing about this album is its labled as pop\/rock and is doing nicely in Australia, Canada, US Billboard 200, and US Rock albums charts (despite barely any promotions), but is not charting on the country charts. This is interesting because the album is more country than most of the pop music that's on the country chart today.\n\nI do have one problem with this album. I can tell Sheryl Crow is a BIG influence on Emily and Martie and you can tell in the style and structure of the songs, but I wanted more of THEM and less of Crow. Hopefully on their next project, they will reveal more of their \"sound\".\n\n4\/5","classification":4}

The entire album fits PERFECTLY with that locker-room celebration photo. Everything is fast and up beat with that college band feel, but actual band talent. It would make great background music for a party.\n\nThe lyrics range from typical lost love themes (Farewell, etc) to happy in the face of problems themes (Singing In The Rain, not a remake of the classic), so there's nothing groundbreaking from a musical standpoint. But it's good!\n\nSinging In The Rain really stood out to me as a great song. Such a positive attitude theme set to great music. Then to add Karmic balance 'PS I Hate You', while not even remotely positive, did a great job of connecting to me because it's an angry break up message to a significant other who's awful, and who can't relate to that?\n\nThe entire album was enough to pop me up and get me into a groove on a sleepy Monday morning at work.

{"text":"For those who are unaware, Rodney Crowell used to be part of Emmylou Harris' Hot Band, way back in the mid-'70s.  Crowell went onto his own success as a songwriter and artist (and Rosanne Cash's first husband).\n\nFast forward 30-odd years later and Harris and Crowell have finally put out an album together, 'Old Yellow Moon'.  While it had been in the works for a while, it was finally released recently.  I was SO looking forward to this when I heard about it almost a year ago.\n\nFor all of Crowell's songwriting skills, only four of the dozen songs are his - the rest are covers from other artists, which is actually Harris' strength.\n\nI really like both artists, so why am I not fully digging 'Old Yellow Moon'?  Was the anticipation too high?\n\nThere are some tunes are old country like, that both performed back in the day - and they can be good (\"Chase the Feeling\", \"Invitation to the Blues\", \"Bluebird Wine\", \"Bull Rider\" and \"Open Season on My Heart\"), but I would be hard pressed to say any were great.\n\nHarris has some really good leads (\"Spanish Dancer\").  Crowell does ok on a few.  Then there are some that should really work well and don't quite deliver (\"Back When We Were Beautiful\").  And then there are one or two that just kind of drag down the disk (\"Black Caffeine\" for example).\n\nHarris still has an incredible voice and I like Crowell as a solo artist and as a songwriter and producer.  I'm not sure why he didn't produce this (or write more songs for this), as it was handled by Harris' ex-husband and the man who helmed a number of her disks in the '70s and '80s (and one or two of her last disks).\n\nPerhaps the disk will grow on me, but I didn't get a great first or second impression.  It's fine - but with artists like these, you expect more than fine.","classification":3}

{"text":"Elvis Presley's final 1976 recordings at Graceland have long been unappreciated by critics. However, this historic two-CD set is worth exploring. The King's instinctive eclecticism rarely falters as he runs the gamut from country weepers to spirited rock 'n' roll. Despite ill health and emotional turmoil, Elvis gives his all with bravura versions of \"Hurt,\" \"Danny Boy\" and \"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain.\" Even toward the end, Presley remained a compelling rocker  delivering the goods on \"Way Down,\" \"Moody Blue,\" \"For the Heart\" and a memorable interpretation of Johnny Ace's \"Pledging My Love.\" Nicely remastered with a second disc of undubbed alternate takes, \"Way Down in the Jungle Room\" is a valuable work from an artist whose musical commitment still touches the soul.","classification":4}

Blink 182)like \"Fat Lip\", \"In Too Deep\", \"Rhythems\", and \"Motivation\", or embrace Satan in songs (I.E. Slayer, duh) like \"Introduction to Destruction\", if you can even call that a real song. The only problem with this CD? I only like 5 songs. \"Fat Lip\", \"Rhythems\", \"Motivation\", \"In Too Deep\", and \"Summer\". Oh, well. Despite that, this is a really good CD. Go buy it.","classification":4}

Sharon Robinson plays all the instruments except Bob Metzger's guitar on \"my secret life\". I do not agree that the heavy use of synths makes the record sterile. Instead I think the synths and Cohens magic and magnificient blend and create a sound that is filled with sollace. The book-let is really nice.

Positive, church inspired, funk music with blistering jam band talent.

{"text":"Some way, some how, four teenagers from lower middle-class families in Liverpool, England formed a rock band, called themselves The Beatles, and changed the world. Their music is love, it's rebellion, it's fun, it's sophisticated, it's thought-provoking, it's magical, it's silly, it's beautiful, it's rock n' roll, and it's GREAT. The Beatles 1962-1966 and The Beatles 1967-1970 (Red and Blue) are both 2-CD compilations of the best of their music. It's all in chronological order, and the song selection is on the mark. Get both of these collections (54 songs), listen to them often, and raise your kids on them (I do). This music will enrich your life, lift you up, make you happy, and give you hope when all hope is lost. The Beatles were, and still are, a very special gift to our world. Enjoy!","classification":5}

{"text":"I love pretty much everything Twenty One Pilots does.  Each album is different from the last.  This one has liberal doses of rap with reggae undertones here and there, punctuated by belt it out angst, life's a bitch (yet with hope resounding subtly throughout).  Great if you're in a suicidal frame of mind- I'm down but not ready to check out yet, at least not without a fight, e.g.,  \"A bullet for everybody in the room-\" but \"I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride.\"  [I say that because I think it's great to have a way to VENT angry\/destructive feelings, not because I think they're \"cool\" in some way.]  Plus, the song has the soaring Beatles-like oohs, ohs, and sighs I love.\n\nSomething about this band resonates in my heart of hearts.  Decidedly unique, like no-one else- an heady amalgam of different genres and styles- a fusion.  Not muddy- clarity of beats and melodies- PURE, infectious, rollicking- can't help but bob and weave, dance.  Every song on the album is good, ties together, weaves the story of Blurryface.  If you're not a fan yet, try this, it may insinuate itself into your very bones.  Stressed Out is a beautiful, whimsical, lyrical [in every sense of the word] rap song:\n\n\"Stressed Out\"\nI wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard,\nI wish I had a better voice that sang some better words,\nI wish I found some chords in an order that is new,\nI wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang,\n\nI was told when I get older all my fears would shrink,\nBut now I'm insecure and I care what people think.\n\nMy name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.\nMy name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.\n\nWish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.\nWish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.\n\nWe're stressed out.\n\nSometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young,\nHow come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from,\nI'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it,\nTry to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one,\n\nIt'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose,\nSame clothes homegrown a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam,\nBut it would remind us of when nothing really mattered,\nOut of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter.\n\nMy name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.\nMy name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.\n\nWish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.\nWish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.\n\nWe used to play pretend, give each other different names,\nWe would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away,\nUsed to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face,\nSaying, \"Wake up, you need to make money.\"\nYo.\n\nWe used to play pretend, give each other different names,\nWe would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away,\nUsed to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face,\nSaying, \"Wake up, you need to make money.\"\nYo.\n\nWish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.\nWish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days,\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.\n\nUsed to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny\nWe used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money\nUsed to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny\nWe used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money\nWe used to play pretend, give each other different names,\nWe would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away,\nUsed to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face,\nSaying, \"Wake up, you need to make money.\"\nYo!","classification":5}

I was curious to see what they came up with after being gone for around 6 years. Unfortunately this album has nothing interesting to offer. It's just cliched predictable radio rock with no heart or edge to it. I swear the chorus of the song \"failure\" felt like a Kelly Clarkson song. I feel like BB really could've come back with some urgency and bite to them but it's just the same stuff they've always done. They pretend to be heavy, they pretend to write interesting hooks without actually doing so. If someone wants to hear some good accessible hard rock\/alt. metal then try Chevelle, Sevendust, or Helmet. All of those bands are heavier and simply write more interesting and creative material.","classification":2}

{"text":"5 Stars if you're new to Eisley; 4 Stars for the rest of us\n\nEisley has released 2 EPs in early and late 2003, the excellent \"Laughing City\" and \"Marvelous Things\". For whatever reason, it's taken over another year for the release of their debut album. The band is in my book one of the best new bands out there, and Coldplay's Chris Martin is a big fan as well (Eisley opened for Coldplay on part of their 2003 US tour).\n\n\"Room Noises\" (12 tracks, 41 min.) is full of dreamy, yet very catchy songs, not unlike, say, Sixpense None the Richer. The best songs are in the first half of the album, including the opener \"Memories\", \"I Wasn't Prepared\", \"Memories\" (the standout track of the album), and \"Brightly Wounded\" with great intertwining vocals from the sister lead singers. Other great tracks are \"Plenty of Paper\", a great up-tempo song, and the closer \"Trolley Wood\".\n\nWhat keeps me from giving this 5 stars is that 4 of the songs are rehashed from the 2 EPs (in newly recorded versions), and that's disappointing to a degree for those of us that have followed Eisley from the beginning. We want more new songs! Finally, the Amazon listing shows a bonus track (a remixed version of \"Lost at Sea\") but the CD I bought doesn't have it, hmmmm... Regardless, Eisley is a breath of fresh air in today's music scene.  Eisley is coming to Cincinnati shortly and I can't wait to see them live! \"Room Noises\" is highly recommended!","classification":4}

{"text":"The Bear's Choice Expanded Edition focuses on the Grateful Dead live in concert. Four additional tracks are added to the original seven and the late Ron McKernan(Pig Pen) sings on six of them.\nThe opening five acoustic tracks are warm and intimate if not overly spectacular. The Pig Pen sung Katie Mae stands out a bit from the rest. The Smokestack Lightning jams are a bit excessive even though they can be a bit mesmerizing if you merely have them on in the background. However, the highlights of this disc are Pig Pen's stylish singing on Big Boss Man and Hard To Handle. Old Piggie sure knew how to sing the blues.\nAnyway, definitely like Jerry Garcia's interpretation of Sitting On Top Of The World. Again, Good Lovin' is another bonus track on this CD as it was on Europe 72. The jam is somewhat excessive although the drum solo is pretty captivating.\nAgain like Europe 72, several good moments and I like the idea of both acoustic and electric sides of the Grateful Dead. However some of the jamming certainly goes off the deep end. My only advise is know how much endless instrumental noodling that you can take.","classification":3}

While he was never a part of the MTV era, his music is still just a great escape to, and honestly still holds up better to all the crap music that has came out over the past several years.

{"text":"This is an excellent duets album by Van Morrison.  Van gives fans a beautifully reflective song like  \"Streets of Arklow\". This is a place in his native Ireland. Mick Hucknall gives a subtle but moving vocal delivery on this song. There is a great up tempo song like \"Real Real Gone\" featuring Michael Buble.  This song is a four minute party of a song. \"Carrying A Torch\" is another gem of a song.  I think Clare Teal has a lovely voice.  She makes this song beautiful.  Bobby Womack contributes his talent on the song \"Some Peace of Mind\". The sax and horn playing on this song makes it special.. Van teams up with the soulful Joss Stone on the most romantic tune on this album entitled \" Wild Honey\". Van Morrison brings out singers I have heard in years to work with him on this album.  Jazz legend George Benson lends his talents on the song \"Higher Than The World\". George sounds good vocally here.. He also  sounds superb playing the guitar on this track too. \"If I Ever Needed Someone\" is a very touching song featuring Mavis Staples.  This is a good song about a special friendship. \"How Can A Poor Boy\" has a delightful  blues  tone  features masterful  harmonica playing.  Every song sounds fresh on this album.

See, e.g., Boston, way back in the day, who put out a clone of their first album and were promptly forgotten. The first album was PERFECT. This doesn't strive to be that same album, all over again. Whereas the first one was all Otis Redding, this one has a lot more Sly & the Family Stone. They expand their sonic range. Some of that doesn't always knock it out of the park for me, but I'm glad the boys were trying, stretching their limitations. Honestly, this one is only 80-90% of the 1st in my subjective opinion, but then, I'd have given the 1st one 6 stars if I could, so this still rates a 5 star with me.","classification":5}

{"text":"Released in 1983, Duck Rock has passed the test of time with flying colors. It's pure genius, a brilliant fusion of world and roots music, scratch and sampling techniques, dance beats, pop hooks and rock riffs. The mostly instrumental Obatala opens the album on a moody mid-tempo note; based on a drumming style from the Dominican Republic, the languid track has snippets of a female vocal far in the background. Legba is similarly atmospheric but based on Cuban beats and purely instrumental whilst Buffalo Gals is an expertly arranged feast of samples, scratching, percolating rhythms and solo & massed vocals.\n\nFour songs are inspired by and employ musicians from South Africa, three from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Zulu\/dp\/B000000DXI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Zulu<\/a>&nbsp;culture and from the Shangaan (Tsonga). They are (a) the uptempo Double Dutch, one of the catchiest numbers with African melody and instruments plus distinct types of backing vocals (b) the fascinating hybrid, Punk It Up, a song about&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Sex-Pistols\/dp\/B000002KIE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Sex Pistols<\/a>&nbsp;done in Zulu style with pennywhistles and gospelly backing vocals, sung in English and Zulu (c) the melodic Jive My Baby Jive with its great interplay of male and female vocals and hypnotic beat, whilst (d) the buoyant Living on the Road in Soweto is an example of Shangaan township music, a very popular style also present on Paul Simon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Graceland\/dp\/B0002EQ7E2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Graceland<\/a>.\n\nAnother one with a pronounced African influence is Song For Chango, made up of chanting and Afro-Cuban rhythms. The fast-paced and polyrhythmic Merengue takes the listener back to the Dominican Republic, and is vaguely reminiscent of some of the styles that&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Kid-Creole-The-Coconuts\/dp\/B0000DG028\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kid Creole & The Coconuts<\/a>&nbsp;experimented with. Duck Rock concludes with Duck for the Oyster, a vibrant finale based on the Appalachian square dance with inspired fiddle playing. What makes it all the more charming and cohesive is the voice of a DJ and the callers that give it the lively feel of a radio show.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/McLaren\/dp\/B0000026U5\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">McLaren<\/a>&nbsp;proves himself to be an excellent stylist on this innovative and well-produced album.

{"text":"Thought this was Kesha when I first heard it (\"...glitter all over the room....\"), and, to tell you the truth here, once I found out that it wasn't Kesha, I branded it instantly as a Kesha ripoff. The glitter reference, the Tik-Tok vibe (and tone)... I thought, \"yeah, that a blatant steal, man. Kesha ought to go right ahead and demand the frigging royalties. ALL OF THEM.\"\n\nBut the truth is: IT IS NO SUCH THING.\n\nYou know, it's strange how pop music seems to finds a consensus-theme within the record buying public. FRIDAY is actually the fifth single from Perry's album -- she wasn't trying to copy Kesha at all (check the dates of release(s)) -- I'm just saying that to think she was writing essentially the same stuff as Kesha was at almost the same time, purely by accident, is bizarre.\n\nBut hey, there it is.\n\nFRIDAY is in the headache-to-read key of D-sharp minor (6 sharps!), which means that it was almost certainly written on keyboard... yet the strummy guitars give the track a different vibe (as they're used here) while still holding the headache \"keyboard\" key -- and the final result is damned interesting. The song seems to walk a tightrope between positive & negative vibes: the 6 sharps \"should\" give the song a buzzy, positive vibe (a \"feel\" that the intelligent use of guitar here seems to take away) while simultaneously being held in a minor key throughout \"should\" (again, in theory, here) give the song something of a down-vibe -- which the intelligent use of guitar here also takes away. In other words, it's like somebody sanded down the extreme edges on both sides of a box of chaos, and left nothing but a simple and very cool middle that manages to somehow not sound sterilized. It's interesting that the lyrics (which basically say that, hey... you know, we did all of this stupid stuff... but it's totally cool, no biggie...) strike a positive\/negative message, and the music is able to correctly fit that, all because the tambre of the strummed guitar within D-sharp minor permits it. It's some pretty sophisticated thinking, and I absolutely like the result.\n\nI consider work like this to be experimental, although I do like it when an artist does try it -- and so few do anymore. She won't be able to repeat this, though... (Stevie Wonder has already done the inverse(s)).\n\nIt's worth 5 stars: 4 for the track itself, plus an extra star for simply being so willing to throw the rulebook away and take a chaotic jigsaw puzzle of disparate musical ideas and mesh them together so perfectly.\n\nKinda cool to see somebody willing to still do this kind of thing on the big chart (aside from Stevie Wonder, that is).\n\nProps.\n\nIt's good work.","classification":5}

{"text":"Don Henley's first solo album in 15 years is being called his \"country debut\". My first thought was this was yet another classic rock artist trying to sell albums, so he's releasing a country album, the only genre that still sells in decent numbers. Turns out, this is not the case. Yes, this has some definite country elements to it, but it sounds, to me, like early Eagles. Perhaps it's the duet partners he's got, Miranda Lambert, Merle Haggard, Martina McBride and Dolly Parton. Or maybe it's the background vocalists, Vince Gill, Jimmy Johnson, Trisha Yearwood, and Alison Krause? Either way, this is just a great album.\n \"Waiting Tables\" could very easily be on an Eagles album today. As could \"Take A Picture of This\". The duet with Martina McBride, \"That Old Flame\" is a definite standout as is the Dolly duet \"When I Stop Dreaming\". There simply isn't a bad song on here.\n This isn't a case of classic rock artist switching to country to sell some records, this is a classic rock artist reaching the pointing in their career when they can do whatever they want.\n As a foot note, if you get the deluxe edition from Target you get two more songs, including yet another duet. This time with Stevie Nicks. 34 years after \"Leather And Lace\" they reunite with \"It Don't Matter To The Sun\".","classification":5}

{"text":"Being one of probably a \"handful\" (relative to the vast sky full of boomers, some of whom may have joined me back then) of Simon devotees who started collecting his music (with and without Art) beginning with Wednesday Morning 3 AM, I have a different take on his releases than most.  I've literally grown up with the man, his music playing in my ear nearly as much as the Beatles who I literally grew up with also.  Paul S and Paul M have been with me all my life.  I am crazy enough to have purchased The Paul Simon Collection simply so I could have a CD copy of Slip Sliding Away which was NOT released as a bonus track on any of the remasters.  Columbia, you tick me off.  STRANGER TO STRANGER fits my modus operandi when it comes to describing the releases of Paul Simon.  Each and every album release is better than the last and yet I do have my favorites.  But the long and short answer, musically, is that Paul Simon strives each and every time to raise the bar on himself and without fail, he succeeds each and every time.\n\nYes there are evidently a small few \"disappointed\" fans for whom this one didn't do it.  I feel differently but that does not assuage the fact that they (and you) might be disappointed.  However, critically, one has to acknowledge that this master of composition is astoundingly creative and each effort masters a new score.  Some folks felt that One Trick Pony and Hearts & Bones were slippages.  For me they were stepping stones from Still Crazy to Graceland, and both of them were steps up on the rungs of his musical genius.  ROS was another quantum leap above Graceland.  And since the turn of the millennium, the man just keeps amping up the dial on his creatometer!  Surprise and Beautiful were monumental for me.  He never loses what he accomplished before, it is all there in the notes and if you look carefully in the small corners of his compositions.  There are hints of Hearts & Bones, Graceland, Rhythm Of The Saints, You're The One, Surprise, So Beautiful, even Still Crazy and There Goes... all over these songs, and yet they are simply beautiful and new and fresh and heartfelt.\n\nPaul's tribute to Harry Partch fits in perfectly with what he himself has accomplished as a composer, and this experiment with new tonalities and sounds just becomes organic in the hands of Paul Simon.  Lyrically, there is an arc of aging which is readily apparent in the last 4 albums, songs where he sardonically and humorously self-deprecates himself as if preparing for \"the afterlife\" in a mirthful Judeo-Christian way.  STRANGER TO STRANGER continues this mother lode and the title of the album itself becomes double entendre as both a tip of the hat to Partch and a nod to himself in that his music continues to evolve into stanger and stanger embryos.  Personally I love it.  Paul Simon never sits still on top of an art form, it is in a constant state of flux and mutation.  Again, this album is organically perfect in the caravan which Paul debarked upon in 1963, his travels taking us on a mythic journey of sonic development that is full of beauty, grace, profundity, and curiousity.  I hope the majority of Simon fans will find this another treasure trove, as I have.  Sometimes you have to give his music a few more than one or two listens before it grabs hold, but once it does, your hooked.\n\nThe sounds on this album are subtly (not hugely) different, you will hear things that sound familiar but are craftily engaging and auraly honed on an almost imperceptible scale.  This was the beauty of Partch's instrumental inventions.  Like oriental and Indian music, the tones and scales are measurably different but they invoke a dreamy substance that is at once enjoyable and influential.  What you end up with is a Paul Simon album that sounds astral, current, pleasurable, and even instructive.  If he stops here, he will have donated as much as any other artist in music history if not a vast treasures worth more.  Hopefully Paul has more to give us in the future, but this album alone is worth every penny and listening effort for any fan of sonic creations.  Oh and the \"deluxe\" version is well worth the extra $ as there is no \"filler\" here, just wonderful tunes to love and enjoy, especially his performance of Duncan (from his first post-S&G solo album) on The Prairie Home Companion radio show, simply stupefying, and a great duet by two founders of Boomer Era music, Paul and Dion musing about their NYC.\n\nEnjoy the music friends!","classification":5}

{"text":"Over the years, Wilco has grown into one of the great American rock n roll bands.  The band's restless spirit, which first showed itself fully on Wilco's second album (Being There) has not abated one bit as the years have passed.  Each new album is an experience, a journey with its own unique story to reveal. As the band's primary songwriter, Jeff Tweedy has also maintained his way with a melody over the years. What makes Wilco most compelling (to me) is that even at the band's most experimental, the songs still at their core have their roots in approachable melodic rock. You could play most of them on just an acoustic guitar (Tweedy does this at times) and they'd sound pretty good.\n\nWith a band this interesting and captivating, you'd have to figure that the material they haven't released for public consumption is going to be pretty good.  As a dedicated fan I already have some of the tracks on this set (particularly the ones from the YHF era) so I had a pretty good inkling that this would be a treat.  But as always, Wilco has exceeded expectations.  This is a very generous set with everything from revealing early demos to live cuts.  You can trace the band's history and thinking through each of their phases, hearing what ideas they followed through to fruition on the albums and which they did not.  But more than just an interesting historical document, this is a very engaging listen.  Pretty much everything here is worth listening to again and again, just like the albums themselves.\n\nThis set is reasonably priced, so hopefully many Wilco fans will be able to hear it.  It's certainly worth the time and investment for those like myself who have grown up with this band's music.  It's hard to believe that it's been 20 years since Wilco formed (I was starting college back then!!) and that I've been living with some of these songs on frequent replay for more than half my lifetime.  I still get chills when I hear some of the cuts on Being There, Summerteeth, YHF, Ghost and Sky Blue Sky.  For fans like myself, this set is a must own.","classification":5}

{"text":"One thing to be said about Chante Moore is she's always had the pedigree for huge creative success. A love for jazz and a heavy gospel back round have given her a powerfully rangey vocal instrument that lends itself wonderfully to the highest form of interpretation to both original material and even the songs of others if needed. Also having been in the glamour profession as a model ala' Whitney Houston helped in the image department. However when I hear one of her songs on the radio or these days on YouTube my feelings for her are always the same: being presented with a tremendous vocal talent that is constantly pandering to every cliched hip-hop\/soul trend that comes along in terms of being a composer. I only had ever bought her debut album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Precious\/dp\/B000002OKZ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Precious<\/a>&nbsp;before this-hoping the level of musical chutzpah she showcases on her collaborations with other artists would fulfill itself more strongly when she made another of her comebacks-a term I use since her albums always come fairly few and far between. In the end,lets just say there is a direction presented here.\n\n  \"Baby Can I Touch You In The Rain\" is not a bad way to open the album at all-delivering a piano driven jazzy-soul number with strong pop craft involved. \"Talking In My Sleep\" is strong melodically as well as musically-with a vocally appropriate use of the 2-step dance\/hip-hop beat that's...yes has been more than overused and dull for several years now to me but this song uses it well. \"Alone\" is a deep,throbbing and bass heavy funk jam of the sort I've never heard from Chante' before-not to say she's never done them. Combined as it with with more strong song-craft,its impressive enough to be a personal favorite here. The sad \"Don' Make Me Laugh\" and \"Giving You Always\" are nuanced and relaxed ballad type songs instrumentally-Chante's vocals going from cooing to gospel\/soul\/jazz fire as the song builds. \"Doctor Doctor\" references the horn part of Sam Cooke's \"Shake\" for a contemporary production of a mid 60's uptempo gospel\/soul workout and is another personal favorite of mine here.\n\n  \"Mrs. Under, Stood\" uses some interesting wordplay with a very chunky mid tempo funk\/pop groove. \"On And On\",the only collaboration here with Da Brat is my least favorite song here. Its a high powered and repetitious electro dance\/pop number that adds nothing particularly new to the genre-even Chante's gospel power which,by the way is used to greater effect on the more live jazz instrumental sounding gospel workout \"Jesus I Want You\". The album concludes with her interpretation of \"Cry Me A River\"-a number that lives up to Chante's vocal talents. Overall this is an excellent album outside of one song that deducts it a start for me-which came off like an easy way to get radio airplay when pop music is still trying to resolve an extremely shallow and condescending period. As for Chante' Moore herself she delivers a consistently strong album for the most part. One could nit pick on it not being exactly transcendent. But starting out as a recording artist in the 1990's,when few popular artists had developed a well rounded musical back-round for an enduring appeal,she's proven herself more than versatile and talented to weather whatever musical storm she has been caught up in her career.","classification":4}

{"text":"When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, she has honestly the most overexposed artist of the past decade. For female artists, it has mainly been about her and everyone else, can go to the shelter. Sadly, her music has also lost its shine in voice and heart. Her last album 4 was absolutely atrocious. She really didn't ignite a fire in the way she did with her earlier music. That was shown in each and every song from that album, and sadly the ballads have weighed down in soul. Best Thing I Never Had is definitely a blah song, not anything to absolutely rave about. She really didn't ignite a fire from her voice into the song, and instead it felt watered down in song, especially compared to the ballads she had in her career before like Halo and Listen. Maybe she needs to find her voice again, and it will be the best thing she never had.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3}

{"text":"I own most of Jaheim's music and this man never releases a bad album.  When he records an LP, he obviously brings his A-game because one can hear it in his voice: He is focused when he sings and he means every word he belts out.  He is one of the best male artists of today, easily.  Why?  Foremost, because he has a beautiful tenor singing voice and knows just how to use it.  He does not over-sing and he stays on key so well!  \"The Makings of A Man\" is one of the best albums of 2007 because it is consistent and there are some great tunes on this album.  Most of the songs are mid-tempo and about women and relationships.  Also, there are twelve songs so the album is not too short and not lengthy either.\n\n Jaheim will find some way to tell you that he is a reformed thug on each and every album.  I know he is serious, but it's a little funny that he feels the need to continually remind us.  This time, his thug story is found on \"Life of A Thug.\"  He exposes some of the malicious things he did during that juncture in his life, and if you listen closely, he was a pretty bad guy.  This song is nicely produced; I particularly like the horns.  Also, the hook gives it replay value.  \"She Ain't You\" and \"Voice of R&B\" are great tracks.  Vocally, he does a splendid job.  The lyrics are meaningful, especially to Jaheim fanatics.  He informs his listeners that he is very important to the genre of music called R&B, and he is.  Keyshia Cole is my boo and she did well on \"I've Changed\", but that is one of the weakest songs on the album.  The song is average at best.  The hook isn't too good and neither are the lyrics or the production.  Jaheim has included quite a few songs about his mother on his albums.  Here, we have a song called \"Back Together Again.\"  This heartfelt number has an emotional Jaheim singing about how his parents are united in heaven.  It's a lovely moment on the album.\n\n I hope I have convinced you to pick this album up, download it from iTunes, do SOMETHING!  I enjoyed it all the way through.  Be advised, this is a laid back album.  There aren't any dance tracks, just ballads and mid-tempos, but truly worth your time.  4 shining stars.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"Just Don't Have a Clue\"\n2. \"Back Together Again\"\n3. \"Life of a Thug\"\n4. \"What You Think of That\"\n5. \"Lonely\"","classification":4}

{"text":"It has been over a year since Rod Stewart has released a record, and unfortunately he did dissapoint. After the lackluster Soulbook album last year, and his mixed 2006 Still The Same: Rock Classics cover album, he has tried to rekindle the songs that made him a crooner from this past decade. It unfortunately has felt like he did turn off a lot of his die hard Forever Young fans, while he did have a few nice wrinkles re-issued from his classics a few years ago including a re-issuing of his Storyteller boxed set, and his acclaimed Unplugged & Seated from 1993. But with all that hype, Rod has decided to back to his crooner fashion, and try to revise his songboook series. But is it worth while? Well, maybe Ol' Blue Eyes would've not been convinced.\n\nFly Me To The Moon: The Great American Songbook Volume V, is Rod Stewart's return to his songbook series, that really revised him as a strong and soulful crooner. This time around, he tackles covers from Dinah Washington, and The Chairman Of The Board Frank Sinatra, in this collection. The songs aren't bad on some of the covers including I've Got You Under My Skin, I've Got The World On A String, and What A Difference A Day Made. Rod does noblely well, but he does overdo Sinatra's standards here on the record as a back to basics here, instead of trying other standards from other acts that he could've done like Sammy Davis Jr. & Dean Martin to just name a few.\n\nWhile Fly Me To The Moon: The Great American Songbook Volume V, isn't a bad buy from Rod Stewart, it still honestly a much better covers' album than the one Santana made at the same time. But, it honestly isn't as domiant as the covers' album Phil Collins released last month with his Going Back album. That one was more lively. Still, if Rod does release another Great American Songbook volume, it should be more diverse from other kinds of standards' acts. Still if you've loved Rod's first four volumes of The Great American Songbook, you'll definitely like Volume V.\n\nAlbum Cover: B\n\nSongs: C 1\/2+\n\nPrice: C\n\nMastering: C\n\nOverall: C+","classification":3}

For Green Day, it also is a great time to re-introduce their classic to a new audience and that is the case with Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life) from their 1997 album Nimrod. The song still absolutely stands as one of their finest works of their musical career. The song is still one of their best works from their catalog.

{"text":"Among the Herman's Hermits compilations currently available (as I write this, it is still available in the UK), this is as good as any.\n\nTheir American chart history was very different from their UK chart history. Some singles were released in one country but not the other and even where a single was released in both, it often did much better in one than the other. Despite having a UK number one hit with their first single, they were much more popular in America than Britain from 1964 to 1966 but the positions were reversed thereafter.\n\nThe American top ten hit, Leaning on a lamp post, and two other American top forty hits (Don't go out in the rain, Museum) are not included here, though none of these made the UK charts - only Museum was actually released in the UK. Also missing is Hold on, the title track of a film they starred in. The only UK hit missing is Oh you pretty thing, a Peter Noone solo track recorded in the early seventies.\n\nHerman's Hermits began with I'm into something good (a cover of a song by Earl Jean of the Cookies), their only British number one hit, which also made the American top twenty. Six top ten American hits including two number ones were never released as UK singles, these being Can't you hear my heartbeat (a UK hit for Goldie and the gingerbreads), Mrs Brown you've got a lovely daughter, I'm Henry the eighth I am (an old music hall song), Listen people, Leaning on the lamp post (inexplicably omitted from this collection) and Dandy. Two UK singles - Show me girl, You won't be leaving - made the top twenty but were not released as singles in America.\n\nSome singles were released in both countries, these being Silhouettes (a cover of a fifties song by The Rays), Wonderful world (a song that has also charted for both Sam Cooke and Louis Armstrong at different times), Just a little bit better, A must to avoid, This door swings both ways, No milk today and East west.\n\nThere's a kind of hush was a top ten hit in both charts although it was a bigger hit in America. I can take or leave your loving just missed the UK top ten and just missed the American top twenty. After that, Herman's Hermits never again made the American top forty but continued to chart in Britain.\n\nTheir remaining major UK hits were Sleepy Joe, Something is happening, My sentimental friend, Years may come years may go and Lady Barbara. Here comes the star (an Australian song) and Bet your life I do (written by members of Hot Chocolate before they became famous for their own music) were lesser UK hits.\n\nDespite missing a few songs, this collection will provide enough Herman's Hermits music for most people. Some years ago, there were two CD's available in the UK titled Best of the EMI years (Volume 1 1964 - 1966, Volume 2 1967 - 1971). These are now out of print but together remain the most comprehensive collection of their music yet released on CD.","classification":5}

It is also listed at #73 of the top rock songs of all time.\n\nThis music is classified as funk-rock, a cross between disco and rock, and probably the best example of this that there is.\n\nYeah, \"Play that funky music, white boy!\"\n\n5 stars, mainly for nostalgia and staying power.","classification":5}

{"text":"Highlighted by compassionate soul that is showcased with timeless songwriting,\n  superlative production, national pride and plenty of captivating artistry to spare, the\n  band Mumford And Sons scored an award-winning masterpiece in 2012 that would\n  become a blockbuster success.  Filled with rock solid camaraderie, pulsating solos,\n  excellence and a compelling tone, Babel is a near-perfect folk-rock album featuring\n  songs about hope and self-determination- abeited by the bands folk-rock virtuosity\n  performed with crystallized harmony and powerful singing.  Starting with the official\n  title track, the embolden track set concludes with other classic songs like Whispers\n  In The Dark, I Will Wait, Holland Road, Ghosts That We Knew, Not With Haste and\n  three bonus tracks, including a take on the 1969 Simon And Garfunkle classic The\n  Boxer (with Paul Simon and Jerry Douglas sitting in) and a couple acoustic original\n  folk tracks which give it the acoustic laden touch that it fully deserve.  This is British\n  folk-rock showcased by an English inspirational background as it glisten with bright\n  drama and enthralling merriment, so thanks to Babel, Mumford And Sons had took\n  their music toward bigger heights.  A Number One album in both Great Britain and\n  the United States, the album even got lots of critical accolades, thanks in part from\n  its phenomenal success, as the band mastered the sonically impeccable virtuosity\n  and punch-to-the-gut power with their towering stroke of genius that is showcased\n  by the benefiting folks sounds bind with their unrestrained characteristics that also\n  made Babel a more subtle accomplished album.

{"text":"The Fray is one of those contemporary soft-rock groups that show that that genre's stereotype of being slow and dull need not always apply.  \"Over My Head (Cable Car)\" describes lead singer, Isaac Slade's, contentious relationship with his older brother Caleb (nicknamed `cable car').  In the music video for \"Over My Head\", Isaac plays the role of his older brother, while his real life younger brother, Micah, portrays Isaac.

I finally listened to the first single when it came out and thought it was kind of bland. I thought she needed to go more in a direction of keyshia cole with her type of voice. I think she could have def. benifitted from this. It seemed like all the beats were weak, and the album version of if it isn't love doesn't really sound that good compared to the music video on tv and on the computer. I thought spotlight two was pretty dull, and pocketbook was ok. With the if it isn't love video, I can def. see that she has talent and that she could potentially make some great music, but as far as this goes she could have done a much better job! TOO GENERIC!

{"text":"A good friend of mine pointed out this song as one that readily blessed her, and I appreciate her enough that I bought my own copy.  I'm not a huge Chris Tomlin fan, but then neither is she, so I felt it was worth checking out.  As it is, I can readily see how this song may encourage someone who may be facing some fears or anxiety.  Since I'm not (yet) doing so, the song wasn't as meaningful to me as one that would describe blessed assurance or confident faith instead of the drumming up of courage.  So much for the message of the song, as to its musical properties, I found it to be a very plodding song, like someone is forcing themselves to take another step along a path they don't want to go.  At some point in a bridge the plodding turns into a march as the tune gains confidence, but then it returns to the plodding like its reached a point in the journey that the path isn't as difficult or scary, like the summit of a mountain and they're taking in the majestic panorama.\n\nSo to sum up, the song, both lyrically and musically, is evocative and simple, but will bless someone more if it meets them where they're at in life.","classification":4}

{"text":"When it has came down to Mariah Carey and her music right now, she doesn't really deliver. Not just in her music, but her marriage to Nick Cannon has absolutely failed. Her album Me I Am Mariah: The Elusive Chanteuse has been absolutely nothing but a big failure. She honestly does not have anymore what she used to, in songs at heart, the artists that really have delivered in voice and soul, and the talent as well. Her latest album hasn't had the songs either. #Beautiful featuring Miguel is definitely not a strong duet heart and soul. Miguel seems to take all the talent away from Mariah, and you really don't have much of her voice in the song. She could've brought out much more into the song, and a better stride. If you are new to Mariah Carey's music, I would absolutely recommend passing this one up for something much better from her like her work back in the 90's. Her songs were there and her voice was stronger.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2}

{"text":"This is Cher's latest offering, first released in the UK and Canada in late 2001, and in the US in early 2002. UK and Canada had \"The Music's No Good Without You\" as a first single, whereas the US had \"A Song For The Lonely\" as the first single. LIVING PROOF continues the trend started by BELIEVE, her comeback album. \"A Song For The Lonely\" has a very upbeat message in it, many have used it to cope with the tragedies of 9-11, it's a universal song of acceptance that we've come to expect from Cher. There are other songs in this vein as well, \"Alive Again\" sort of mirrors the message of \"Believe\", just a song about survival and the desire to feel alive again. I really like \"Real Love\" which has a almost retro sound to it. The second single in the US is \"A Different Kind of Love Song\", which is also similar to \"A Song For The Lonely\", just a song of acceptance. She continues the trend with electronica. \"You Take It All\" is another highlight here. Other highlights include \"Rain, Rain\", and \"Love Is Lonely Place Without You\". The only songs I didn't care for were the Diane Warren penned \"Body to Body, Heart To Heart\" and the song \"When The Money's Gone\". Overall another strong album, nothing different but it should satisfy most fans.","classification":4}

{"text":"1972 is as well documented a year as any, in the grateful dead's long history. what, with the europe tour and the glory of the summer\/fall tour including 'sunshine daydream' these have been some of the very best shows recorded and officially distributed. if your a fan of this period you have many great shows to chose from and some of my favorite shows ever are from this year. with this in mind, i was surprised that dave released another show from 1972 now. in his intro on the dead site, dave said that dick l. had considered this show for release some time ago, so i can only speculate that this show must have been on his radar for a while. as with all of the dave's picks so far, this one has crystal clear recording and sounds great. disc 1 is a great representation of first set live dead from this era and the china cat\/ rider is the icing on the cake. the' birdsong' is very sweet as always. the whole band can be heard beautifully and as famous as the dead were for fiddling around with their stage setup\/sound system they got it right this night on all accounts. disc 2 gets us into the meat of the show and the 'casey jones', 'cumberland blues' ,'el paso' , 'he's gone' sequence is really nice.  as is common from 72, the ' truckin' jam is outstanding , into a good, 'the other one' . not the very best like d.p 4, d.p. 8, d.p. 23 and some from europe, but still good. into 'brokedown palace' which is a bit unusual. i am very happy to report that dave has filled up the back end of disc 3 with some great tunes from a couple nights earlier including  one of my favorite 'playing in the band' , 'wharf rat' and closes with  'nfa, gdtrfb, nfa' .. so, dave has hinted  that big things are coming in the soon to be future, as the band gets ready to celebrate their 50th anniversary .. the cool cover concept and the extra cuts i hope are just the beginning of whats to come as we move towards 2015.","classification":4}

{"text":"This triumphant return to the charts for Cher definitely qualifies her for the status of \"legendary pop songstress\".  She has always been unique through working with her voice and developing an unique style, dramatic and ironic.  Nowadays, she's going a slightly different path, but most fans should be well pleased.\n\"Believe\" of course is the cornerstone and the starting point for this CD.  The best of the following songs are at the forefront and while they are in the same mode as the title song, \"The Power\", \"Runaway\", \"All Or Nothing\", and \"Strong Enough\" each are great and individual cuts.  Admittedly, the energy seems to go downward with \"dove'e L'amore\" and the last four tracks, but it's still Cher and that isn't bad.\nThis album and the subsequent \"Living Proof\" present us with a gal who seems a bit happier and less sardonic and ironic with her material than in the earlier days.  Indeed, there has been a change, but we, her fans from the early days, have experienced change too and this is a very rewarding addition to one's collection.","classification":4}

{"text":"On his fourth release in his four year carrer, Ne-Yo decided to make a concept album. While concept albums, are nothing new, I can't recall an R&B artist whose actually gone all out the way Ne-Yo has with Libra Scale. The album is full of the slow jams and music designed to make you feel good. The deluxe edition comes with three long form videos for the singles Beautiful Monster, Champagne Life and  One In A Millon which all show Ne-Yo's creative side. After viewing the videos, it would have been nice to see the mini-movie that was oringally planned for the album. I can only think of one compliant with the album and that's the digipack, but other than that, Ne-Yo has produced another fine album and I can't wait for the tour.\n-- Track By Track--\n1. Champagne Life - The second single no explanation necessary. **** out of ****\n\n2. Makin' A Movie - Ne-Yo has always provided some sexy slow jams on his albums and this is no expectation. **** out of ****\n\n3. Know Your Name  - This is another  smooth slow that compliments the former track very well. I could easily see this video taking place after Champagne Life and before One In A Million. *** out of ****.\n\n4. Telekinesis - Another sexy slow jam t completes a trilogy of slow jams.  **** out of ****\n\n5. Crazy Love feat. Fabolous - As a preview reviewer said Fab, spits a nice verse in this song and considering this is the sixth track that the two have done together, I'm sure that they could make an album together that would be very nice. **** out of ****.\n\n6. One In A Million - The third single where Ne-Yo shows off his rapping skills. Much credit is given as Ne-Yo never goes into the territory of a singer trying to be a rapper. **** out of ****.\n\n7. Genuine Only - Every Ne-Yo album has a filler song and this is the song on this album. I would have loved to have the slow jam Chillin on the album instead of this one. ** out of ****.\n\n8. Cause I Said So - This is the only song other than Beautiful Monster, I don't really care of. I think it's a bit too much on the pop side. ** out of ****\n\n9. Beautiful Monster - I didn't really care for this song when I first heard it and I still don't. However the video is very creative. ** out of ****\n\n10. What Have I Done?  - The perfect way to close out the album and the storyline of Jerome & Pretti Sincliar. It's a somber ballad about heartbreak. **** out of ****","classification":4}
{"text":"This is a definite classic alternative rock\/pop love song that I first heard in the 80's, and I still enjoy to this day. I read somewhere online that this song was actually inspired by the lead singer's then fiancee, who eventually became his wife, and still is his spouse to this day. I truthfully feel that is a positive and beautiful fact considering I am a romantic at heart. Anyhow, this is a great song about how free and happy someone feels when they are alone with someone that they are passionate about. I also think that the song is intense and deep in a beautiful way when the singer remarks regardless of what he says, he is always going to love the one that he implies makes him feel alive when he is alone with that person.","classification":5}

{"text":"Unlike many people before this album dropped, I saw the potential that Franky Perez had with this band. In fact, the very thing that people were criticizing the most (getting a single vocalist to complete the entire album \/ tour) turned out to give Apocalyptica a massive upper hand here. Whereas previous releases tended to feel more scattered across the board due to an inconsistent mix of instrumentals and guest vocals, Shadowmaker plays very smoothly from front to back. Having the single vocalist really did this album a favor. But now to the music itself...\n\nExcluding the opening track (I-III-V Seed of Chaos), there are 7 songs featuring vocals and 2 lengthy instrumentals (UNLESS you purchased the Deluxe Edition.... in which case you get 8 songs with vocals and 3 lengthy instrumentals). What I think Franky Perez did absolutely right here was that throughout this album, he vocally covers every facet of music that guest vocalists have covered in the past. Plus, his voice just blends with the cellos beautifully.\n\nI want to take a moment to give some of the definite highlights of the album. If you purchased the Deluxe Edition of the album, you got the song \"Reign of Fire\", a magnificent 7 minute instrumental that shows Apocalyptica in their full, uninhibited glory. This song alone is reason to purchase the Deluxe. And then....\n\nWe have Dead Man's Eyes, the closing track. I could not have asked for a better song to wrap the album up with. It's grandiosity makes it beautiful. Franky's voice is silky smooth, as it's been the whole album, but now he's in absolute overdrive.\n\nI know this review has been a bit lengthy, but whatever. All in all, I highly suggest purchasing this album. It is truly one of Apocalyptica's best albums to date.","classification":5}

{"text":"The majestic song Dead Or Alive opens this 1981 album on which Cale is backed by Sturgis Nikides, Jim Goodwin, Peter Muny & Robert Medici. Alone worth the price of the album, this song portrays the destructive nature of the pornographic underground and is driven by the shimmering trumpet lines of John Gatchell. A live version with a significantly different feel appears on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Comes-Alive\/dp\/B001IJZ188\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Comes Alive<\/a>.\n\nFighter Pilot is another frenzied track where the Bomberettes provide frisky background vocals whilst Cale's voice & viola rule on the multi-layered Wilson Joliet. Eerie & 'gothic,' Streets of Laredo is a slow brooding piece with strange percussive sound effects that wouldn't seem out-of-place in the works of Edgar Varese. Equally downtempo, Strange Times in Casablanca has surrealistic lyrics and a psychedelic texture.\n\nThe highly experimental title track is a strange atonal affair dominated by the French chant of \"honi soit qui mal y pense,\" stabs of high-pitched backing vocals and the weird wailing of dissonant synths & guitars. Normality returns with the mournful & melodious Riverbank that reaches a crescendo before fading out on enchanting instrumentation; it recalls the gentler side of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Wrong-Way-Up\/dp\/B000002LNB\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wrong Way Up<\/a>, Cale's 1990 collaboration with Brian Eno.\n\nRussian Roulette rocks hard in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Slow-Dazzle\/dp\/B0013N47N4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Slow Dazzle<\/a>&nbsp;manner and the album concludes with Magic & Lies, a striking blend of classical and rock that expires on the last gasps of shuddering drum patterns.

{"text":"Right after The Grateful Dead, returned from Egypt in September of 1978, it was announced that the band would play five nights at Winterland, San Francisco. The desert weirdness was coming to the city by the bay!\n\nVolume 1, No. 4 of the: \"Road Trips\" series features the highlights from this last stand of The Dead at great arena before it's December 1978 closing. The shows I have heard from this year of touring have their highs & lows, but the: \"From Egypt With Love\" stand from Winterland, are one of the great moments of GD magic.\n\nMost of the music spread over these two CD's comes directly from the second sets of 10\/21\/78 & 10\/22\/78. Some first set magic is captured as well with Sugaree and Stagger Lee. A bit of the Egyptian music section is one here as Hamza El Din, and his Nubian singers and percussion army perform: \"Ollin Arageed\" as a taste of sounds found on the Nile River on any day of the week. The Dead, takes Ollin Arageed and morphs the tribal chants of the ancient river into a savage rendition of: \"Deal\" a journey from The Great Pyramids to an old west card game.\n\n\"Passenger\" takes The Dead, as close to the Punk bands of the day, as they will ever travel. \"Sugaree\" is streched out in some different directions with some fine slide guitar. \"Sugar Magnolia\" is a wild ride in a Jeep right down the middle of California's deltas between Fresno and Manteca on a warm summer afternoon.\n\nThe drumming onslaught of: \"Not Fade Away\" shows what the band had learned from the tribal chants and drum circles of Egypt. A fine: \"U.S. Blues\" raps up the music of disc one, and a excellent rendition of: \"Goin' Down the Road, Feelin' Bad\" concludes disc two.\n\nThe band sells this at their Official Web Site, for much less cash than it is offered here, and that is the place to seek it out. But, you need to purchase these sets early to receive the third bonus that is only available for a limited time before the vendors are the only ones selling this set in it's complete form.\n\nThe graphic work featured here is amazing, and makes for a very attractive package to house this music in. The music speaks loudly of just what The Grateful Dead, are all about. Musical journeys that span the globe and a thousand centuries. The live music of The Grateful Dead, as only they can produce.\nThis is great: \"Live Dead\"\n4.5 Stars !!!","classification":4}

{"text":"This is a supurb collection of Folk Music. It was released in 1998,but is really Folk Music of the 60's ,all of it written by the person who was the central figure of the Folk Music scene at the height of its popularity. It was the music that represented the thoughts,experiences,hopes,fears,dreams,heartbreaks,protests and just about everything that the music scene portrayed during the sixties. However,anyone familiar with this music is in for a big surprise and treat when they listen to this album. While everything ,all 39 recordings,are from Seeger,all but one,\"And Still I'm Searching\" are other artist's interpreting Seeger's songs. It will be a great surprise for you,as it certainly was for me, to hear these artists singing Seeger's songs. Also,you will find many songs in this collection that will probably be totally new ,or at least somewhat forgotten.\n There are songs that have become so familiar to long time Folkies as well as mainstream listeners, that when done by others will ,to use an old expression,\"knock your socks off\".\n Just to captivate your curiosity,can you imagine:\n  Jackson Browne & Bonnie Raitt singing \"Kisses Sweeter Than Wine\"\n  Bruce Cockburn singing \"Turn,Turn,Turn\"\n  Nanci Griffith and Friends singing \"If I Had A Hammer\"\n  Bruce Springsteen singing \"We Shall Overcome\"\n  Studs Terkel doing \"Blessed Be The Nation\" or \"Oh,Sacred World\"\n  And what would a Folk Music collection be without\nPeter,Paul & Mary,The Weavers and \"Wimoweh\",Odetta and \"One Grain Of Sand\"\n Then to wrap it all up,Pete tells us what his long journey in Folk Music has been all about with \"And Still I'm Searching.\n If you are a Folk Music fan, or a fan of American Music heritage;you'll treasure this collection. The inserts that are included with these two CD's are excellent and will give you a much greater insight into what was on Seeger's mind at the time and how he came about to compose these songs.","classification":5}

The sound is unique, hypnotic, beautiful, mysterious and flawless. This field of music is not the easiest to write in, if the songwriter wants to make songs that are as attention-grabbing as non-ambient songs and genres. But guess what? Nine Inch Nails creates a soundtrack for laying yourself down on your bed, staring at the ceiling, and getting those big smiles on your face every now and then when you think of some funny memory. Amazing instrumental music with a variety of different styles, while maintaining the same overall sound, and very highly recommended for those that want something both excellent and different.

{"text":"Odd that an album said to be based upon unused Division Bell recordings sounds more like stuff from Momentary Lapse of Reason , The Final Cut and Wish You Were Here than anything.  Theres even snatches of Dark Side of the Moon in here.  Billed as a tribute to the late Richard Wright, its an ambient, almost New Age instrumental soundscape ranging from upbeat to melancholy to morose.  A lot of the cues will definitely remind you of the band in all their glory while (too many) others will leave you wondering who wrote this stuff and is this really even a Pink Floyd album.  While its undeniable that Wrights keyboard, Masons drumming and Gilmours guitar are what made their signature sound its been the lack of Waters lyrics, as well as his drive and vision, that helped shape and define them.  And now, as with the previous two albums, its that lack that still hampers them.  Its also very brief; almost half the joints clock in at under two minutes.\n\nThe cd has almost all the tracks playing continuously- another classic Floyd technique- giving them all that continuous thread weve come to know and love; easy to do on an ambient cd.  The opening strains Side Ones first track, Things Left Unsaid, invokes memories of Shine On You Crazy Diamond; the synths sounding like Wright re-visited certain themes and ideas from those sessions.  It continues on into the next cut, Its What We Do; in fact, itd be hard to argue that IWWD isn't simply a revised version of Shine On- its almost a mirror image, right down to Gilmours unmistakable stylings.  Ebb and Flow is musically as good as anything theyve done, mainly because its another throwback- this time to One of These Days.  You starting to notice a pattern yet?\n\nSide Twos Skins does feature some pretty good stuff from Mason as a showcase for his drumming and its a pretty good listen, albeit a short one.  Unsung is hauntingly engaging but way, way too short.  Anisina can be best described as Terminal Frost meets The Great Gig in the Sky.\n\nSide Three kicks off with The Lost Art of Conversation\/On Noodle Street- the bassline of the latter bringing that New Age Jazz feel back again.  Night Light takes you right back to Signs of Life from the Momentary Lapse album.  The first single off the cd- Allons-Y Pt1, as well as Allons-Y Pt2, which is simply a reprise- can be summed in three words: Run Like Hell.  Listen to it and tell me Im wrong.  Talkin Hawkin is only notable for the soundbytes that physicist Stephen Hawking was asked to lend to the recording.\n\nSide Four begins with Calling, a mid-tempo piece thats nice to listen to.  Eyes to Pearls is another pretty good one in the post-Waters vein.  The lone song and finale- Louder Than Words- is Gilmours attempt to capsulize the bands turbulent history to comprise their final bow, but typically the lyrics are too formulaic and measured, forced to fit into his limited, bare bones style.\n\nThe Deluxe Edition kind of gives away how lacking this effort is.  TBS9 and TBS14, the first two, flow into a 70s vibe featuring Wrights organ music.  The truly final cut, Nervana, sends the band out with a flourish as Gilmour flexes his muscles with some impressively rousing riffs, really making you feel it right up until it starts the fade out and you realize that this truly is the end.\n\nOverall, as the coda of a legendary band, Endless River falls short of the mark.  Sorry to say that Pink Floyd has gone gently into that good night.  Roger, I wish you were there.","classification":3}

{"text":"I have adored Taylor Swift ever since she first sprung up on the country music scene a few years ago with her own rendition of Trisha Yearwood's How Do I Live?! Since then, it seems like she has taken the teeny bopper, pseudo country music world by storm and cemented her legacy as country music's version of Brooke Hogan...which is a good thing, actually.\n\nWhat I have always loved about Taylor is that she has always matured as an artist-diva, which is incredible because she's only 19, which means that she's been maturing faster than most people. I also admire how original she is, which is really h\/a\/r\/d to pull off when you're still just a child. Signs of her originality and the fact that she has a highly intelligent mind full of untapped song ideas have been evident ever since her first CD, when she sang about crushes and teen boys, her second CD, when she also sang about crushes and teen boys, her third CD, when she sang about more crushes and teen boys, and, finally, on this CD...when she still continues to sing about nothing but crushing on teen boys!\n\nAnother thing I admire about this artist-diva is the incredible genius of how she approaches a song and its structure. I mean, come on people: Taylor can easily teach some songwriting 101 courses at her local night school...easily! She can also teach these courses to struggling artists such as Mick Jagger, Phil Collins and Bruce Springsteen, duh. Her songwriting approach is uniquely masterful, which explains why she's sold so many records to undoubtedly equally intelligent and cerebral teen girl-fans.\n\nThe songs on Red are a brilliant example of this too-clever-by-half songstress princess. She starts off each song around an ultra-basic, acoustic guitar melody (probably taken straight from a Guitar Hero track), then adds to it by incorporating ultra-profound and deeply meaningful lyrics about teen boys, crushes, diaries and teardrops...on a guitar, which she probably came up with while doodling on her issue of Tiger B\/e\/a\/t or Seventeen. In any case, folks, this formula works, which is why Taylor is still my favorite of the TGPs (teen girl princesses), easily besting that Miley Cyrus t\/a\/r\/t and that Christina Ahgwilera libertine.\n\nI have been listening non-stop to songs like State of Grace, Red and Treacherous on my transistor radio (it has its own AM\/FM band, too!!!), and I continue to be just blown away by Taylor. State of Grace is clearly her ode to gospel music that smartly transitions to whining about teen boys on whom she has a crush. Red is clearly her feminista number that sounds like Lady Gaga sang it while wearing 10-inch stiletto heels and lipstick redder than Heidi Fleiss'; here, too, Taylor awesomely transitions to again singing about teen boys and having a crush on them, which I find truly imaginative and highly original. Even Treacherous is really hardcore before it also segues into being about teen boys...crushes on teen boys...and finally crying about not being s\/e\/x\/e\/d by teen boys while teardrops fall on her guitar. That is some powerful music, man; almost makes William Hung's broken English power ballads from back in the day seem merely human. Almost.\n\nWhile I clearly adore Taylor, I can't make this a totally favorable review. Thus, I have to bring in a slight critique of her, and I apologize to her tween girl fan base in advance for this. However, I think now, with her fourth CD, Taylor can do soooo much better. She should be pushing herself to new challenges and showing more growth and maturity as an artist-diva. She should be taking some lessons from Rebecca Black or at least from Double Take, especially their really sophisticated and soul-searching song called Hot Problems. Take Rebecca's Friday, for example. In that song we all love and listen to every day, Rebecca is able to masterfully take a very complicated topic (partying on the weekend) and turn it into radio gold that also inspires and teaches the entire human race an important lesson about getting your priorities in order. Even the beautiful, young ladies from Double Take (whom I am watching with greater and greater desire) can teach Taylor a thing or two about expert songwriting. Note how their song, Hot Problems, was all about staying in school, studying hard, not having premarital sex, not doing drugs and valuing one's mind instead of one's body. I feel that Taylor should mature more by espousing these wholesome values instead of the \"if it feels good, do it\" ideology that she's been singing about.\n\nNonetheless, I urge you to buy Red and help Taylor become a billionaire before she hits 25!! Her original songs full of awesomeness and intelligence warrant that. I mean, sure, she just seems to be fond of living a life of utter intemperance--going from the Jonas Bros. to Taylor Lautner to John Mayer to Jake Gyllenhaal to Conor Kennedy (my head is spinning!)--but at least she's still more honorable than Michelle Obama.","classification":5}

{"text":"This is a decent album; I personally was expecting more soul into it. What I actually got was a mixture like Geffen is trying to turn Mary J. Blige into a black Carole King. This became apparent in songs \"Smoke\" and \"Fade Away\". I did listen to the record three times consecutively on my recent trip and the first half was pretty good, what I was looking for was for Mary to hit me with something heavy like she has on all of her recent efforts (i.e. PMS, I'm Not Lookin', Changes I've Been Going Through, Not Gon' Cry) and then I heard \"Roses and personally, I'm split with the song. It's Mary but it's didn't grab me like Whoa!.\nI did appreciate \"Just Fine\" a little more than when I did initially. \"Grown Woman\" I love and \"Work that\" picked up where the hidden track from her last album left off. The beat is nice, the lyrics are little B-rate. After \"Just Fine\" things start to run together and sound a bit same, then you run into the second half of the cd where things pick up a little. Her duet with Usher \"Shake down\" is cute but a bit odd vocally. Usher is nice but I would've imagined somebody with a more grown type of voice to complement Mary's (i.e Jahiem or Brian Mcknight). This album is a hit and miss with me, where only a good 3 songs are my favorites and they aren't the best of Mary.","classification":4}

ROnald Isley  needs  to  have the right Producer to  keep the right hits and compliment his  thing the right way and  not water him  down.  the Production here bogs things way down and alot of this  album sounds like  2nd and 3rd tier  re threads of  better material, the saving grace is  Mr. Biggs voice.i hope Him and  R.kelly  set it off  again  because he deserves that challenge again  and not being stuck with some sleepy  time Productions.","classification":3}

{"text":"I'd better at once make it clear that \"No Angel\" and \"Life for Rent\" still are my favorite Dido albums. Both albums contain such a rare large number of great songs and I always gladly return to these her first two albums.\n\nYou had to wait for five years on Dido's third album \"Safe Trip Home\" from 2008. Personal events in Didos life were reflected on this album, which had a distinctly sad tone and which was significantly less commercial.\n\n\"Safe Trip Home\" contained fewer \"big\" songs than the first two albums, but it has a warm and honest feel that compensates the less distinctive songwriting. Songs like \"Look No Further\", \"Quiet Times\" and \"Northern Skies\" are individually very strong songs, which also helps to lift this album.\n\nNow five years have passed again, and Dido has just released her fourth album. One can hardly say that her music has taken a revolutionary turn, but there is generally a far more easy mood on the album, which is also to a greater extent than previously is spiced with electronic elements.\n\nI do, however, feel, like iI did with \"Safe Trip Home\", that some songs sound a little too similar, especially if you choose deleuxe version, which contains six extra tracks.\n\n\"No Freedom\" is a great pop song which has a sound close to the \"Life For Rent\" album.\n\nThe quiet and almost acoustic \"Sitting on the Roof of the World\", is for me another the album's great songs.\n\nSome songs take longer to embrace. Among the songs that have grown on me are \"Loveless Hearts\" and \"End of Night\".\n\nOn the bonus disc, which generally keeps the level of CD 1 songs like \"All I See\" and \"Lost\" are my preliminary favorites.","classification":4}

{"text":"This was another \"Rise of the Masters\" purchase I made to support some occupational therapy goals for sensory integration for our son shortly after he was diagnosed with his sensory processing disorder.  Because of the strength of his reactions to things, sometimes I find myself needing to find middle ground no matter how much I admire and respect the therapists who work with him and their recommendations.  Many OT clinics like to do The Listening Program with sensory processing disorder or Autistic kiddos, and our little man does *not* do headphones.  We've been working on it, working on it, working on it...and we have brief periods of time where he will tolerate it, and most of the time he either rips them off his head or gets agitated at the mere sight.  So in looking at the studies on The Listening Program and AIT therapy in general, some of the information indicates that listening to traditional unmodulated classical music can have similar benefits.  So I purchased a whole bunch of these because the price point was great and they were digital and I could access them from multiple devices.  This is the other collection my son will listen to for a longer period of time then the others.  He prefers the Mozart one, but he'll get through more of this one before requesting it be turned off then he will the remainder of them.","classification":5}

From songs about people travelling to make their way (Telegraph Road, Privateering), to tough characters who brag about their lives (Money For Nothing, Heavy Fuel, Hot or What). And some poor folk who are down and out - these artists are stuck in a groove with their working class poor tales. Then he throws in some dull as hell bluesy songs which does nothing for his music or the genre. He alternates with sad songs using mandolin - a good way to trick people into thinking you've written a good song these days. His conversational songs now grate on me, as uninspired as the rest.

{"text":"\"All American Nightmare\" is the 3rd studio album by US rock band \"Hinder\" released in December 2010. The line up features lead singer Austin Winkler, guitarists Joe Garvey and Mark King, bassist Mike Rodden and drummer Cody Hanson. Before moving into further details, allow me to comment on the beautiful cover artwork featuring model Jesse Lee Denning.\n\nOn the preceding album \"Take it to the limit\", \"Hinder\" took a considerably old school turn in their music by inducing elements of 80s rock, rebalancing their whole sound which one found really appealing. On that basis I was really looking forward to purchasing their new album \"All American Nightmare\".  Upon first play it becomes clear that the old school element is still very much alive on the new album, only this time have placed more emphasis on grooves\/rhythm rather than melody.  For that matter \"...Nightmare\" is built on American rock'n roll at times touching blues rock; still in terms of production, the new album is probably the thickest sounding \"Hinder\" release to date-that has everything to do with star producer Kevin Churko (\"Ozzy\") who is known for thick productions, maximizing the effect of guitars and vocals in the mix.\n\nI have to comment that the overall artistic approach on \"...Nightmare\" proves a successful attempt as it offers a fair amount of quality rockers, much like the previous albums, while reinventing a good part of their style. Favorite tracks include \"Waking up the devil\", \"All American nightmare\" and \"2Sides of me\".","classification":4}

{"text":"After a decade apart, Talib Kweli and producer Hi-Tek- collectively known as Reflection Eternal- return with a new album, the aptly titled \"Revolutions Per Minute\". This new album is a sharp left turn from its predecessor, their 2000 debut \"Train Of Thought\". On this project, it's decidedly more commercial which can be attributed to them being on the major label Warner Bros. Records. The album starts off with the rather slow \"City Playgrounds\" which would have been better suited for being in the middle of the album. \"Back Again\" features the long absent RES sounding noticeably different. Both tracks \"In This World\" and \"Long Hot Summer\" feature background vocals from Belinda Lipscomb, lead singer of the 1980's funk band Midnight Star. \"Got Work\" is a song in which fame is likened to a drug addiction, while \"Ballad Of The Black Gold\" addresses the controversy and conflict over the ever-present oil crisis. The song \"Lifting Off\" is, by all accounts, a weed song complete with an equally smoky sonic backdrop.\n\nTalib handles primarily most of the lead vocals with the exception of the song \"So Good\" which is the lone track in which Hi-Tek actually performs on. The album's best song \"Strangers (Paranoid)\" shows Talib Kweli getting upstaged by Bun B of UGK. There are a few setbacks on \"Revolutions Per Minute\". The songs \"Get Loose\" with Chester French and the Estelle assisted \"Midnight Hour\" are just plain mediocre, while \"In The Red\" suffers from rather mundane production. Overall, Reflection Eternal crafted a good album, but it's a little too radio friendly- even for them.","classification":4}

{"text":"Please excuse the flow of this review. I was taking notes as I listened to the album for the first time. These thoughts are as raw and unfiltered as they can be without being censored by the word police. :o)\n\nSide 1:\nThings Left Unsaid - As any Floydian fan would expect, the opening chords to Things Left Unsaid are hauntingly atmospheric, ambient and try maybe a bit too hard. However, you know its Pink Floyd when Things Left Unsaid melts into Its What We Do. Rick Wrights signature organs bring back 1970, lending itself nicely to a smooth transition from Meddle to 1976s Wish You Were Here and what feels like Shine On You Crazy Diamond Part X. Gilmours solos are on target, though much more melodic than they were when he was a young man. Its Shine On for a more mature audience. Its What We Do transcends a decade of music, but stays true to the era it transcends.\nEbb and Flow is an relaxing mixture of Rick Wrights last solo album and the instrumental tracks offered from Division Bell. Not bad, but not great either.\n\nSide 2:\n Sum - straight off of Ummagumma, Sum offers a very old-school Floydian sound. The pace eventually picks up and gives Nick Mason a chance to do a bit of personal showboatingsomething we haven't seen from him since Dark Side.\n Skins - The drums on Skins actually remind me of A Saucerful of Secrets, and there is some trippy interpretations not unlike its counterpart, without actually redoing or over-doing it.\n Unsung - Unsung brings back immediate memories of Echoes, but again, for a more mature audience. The sound is far more polished, and thats not necessarily what we want to hear. Its perhaps too smooth, but given the similarities to a sound created 40+ years ago, Im okay hearing a return to their roots.\n Anisina - Anisina becomes Us and Them with a bit of Division Bells simplicity mixed in. This song is the first track that I can do without.\n\nSide 3:\n The Lost Art of Conversation  A quiet Richard Wright piano piece with the soothing sounds of rain in the background.\n On Noodle Street  A lot of Wrights influence with some nicely layered strings and some fairly bland drums to keep the tune moving.\n Night Light  Another combination of Shine On and Cluster One. I haven't decided if this is an intentional bridging of two starkly different time periods.\n Allons-Y (1)  This will immediately remind you of Another Brick in the Wall. I love the original, but I can do without this track. It sounds too close to Daves instrumental work off his About Face album circa 1984.\n Autumn 68  My god, yes! This is a tribute to 1968 and Ricks dominating organs. Dave layers in some guitar work, but they take second seat to the powerful organs that pretty much own the song from start to finish.\n Allons-Y (2)  Another Brick in the Wall revisit. Kind of the same. I guess thats fitting since Another Brick in the Wall had parts I, II and III.\n Talkin Hawkin  A beautiful piece. I cant really compare it to anything the Floyd has done in the past. We are treated to more words of wisdom from the great Stephen Hawking, and this song doesnt sound like anything the band has released before. Just a powerful, gorgeous piece.\n\nSide 4:\n Calling  This is definitely trippy, much like the opening track Castellorizon from Gilmours 2006 On An Island. And interestingly enough, theres a bit of Vangelis mixed in here too. (Bonus points for those of you who know who Vangelis is.)\n Eyes to Pearls  I can definitely sense a shift in momentum. The tension is ramping up, almost as if leading to some grand finale. Nicks drums add a reverberating heartbeat, complimenting Daves chords.\n Surfacing  A return to A Great Day for Freedom from Division Bell. Not that Im complaining, but you can definitely hear the Division Bell studio sessions percolating throughout the entire album. Theyre just more prominent here. Im not crazy about the placement of this track. I think Eyes to Pearls should have been placed here as a natural lead in to what is ultimately the final track.\n Louder than Words  The same church bells that led us into High Hopes launch the albums (and the bands) final track. Ever. Unfortunately, the lyrics lack the punch weve come to expect from a Roger Waters penned poem. Fortunately, Daves voice is as strong and as beautiful as ever. High Hopes would actually be a more fitting send off for a band spanning nearly five decades. The lyrics are repetitive and not all that deep. Fortunately, it still manages to fit with the motif our boys carried through the entire 4-side record. It won't go down as one of their better tracks, but it won't be remembered as one of their worst either.\n\nOverall, The Endless River feels very much like a Pink Floyd album. It is not as erratic as some of the 'professional' reviewers would have you believe. It flows quite smoothly, and while it may not wind up the bands most popular album, it's a fitting tribute and lasting send off to a group of guys who will go down in the pages of history.","classification":5}

{"text":"This album is amazingly good considering that it's the band's first since 1997! Mike Patton of course has been a whirlwind of creative energy since then. I'm not sure what the others have been doing, but they sound tight. Clearly they have meshed again since reuniting and touring in 2009 and since. FNM continues to viciously rip into American society, feral in an elegant way (like Warren Zevon's werewolf of London -- \"his hair was perfect\"), featuring piano on several tracks.\n\n\"Sol Invictus\" (Unconquered Sun), the opening track, is quiet, and tackles religious faith, the perfect way to re-launch Faith No More. \"Superhero\" is very strong, a sequel to \"Be Aggressive\" from the band's masterpiece, ANGEL DUST (1992). The song was known as \"Leader of Men\" before it was recorded, which is the repeated line in the chorus. It's a scathing indictment of the American macho attitude. \"Rise of the Fall\" features a reggae passage, which is a great contrast, and a cryptic, fascinating lyric.\n\nI consider \"Matador\" to be the best song on the album. Patton is in full operatic voice, and it is the best melody here. It leads directly into the last song, \"From the Dead,\" which closes the album on the only upbeat note. The last two songs join the first in seeming to be self-referential, and it makes me wonder whether the whole album isn't really about the return of FNM. Unfortunately no lyrics are included with the CD, they have to be searched for online. Some of the songs seem to be just mood, but some are deeper and better knowing what is being said, including \"Black Friday,\" which is another scathing indictment, this time of mindless consumerism. BUY IT! yells Patton.\n\nI have to say that I never found Tomahawk's albums to be very compelling. Of all Patton's projects, that was the post-FNM band most like FNM. So I am relieved that SOL INVICTUS is better than any of those. It's short, but concentrated and powerful. Mike Patton's voice is center stage, yes, and it is as impressive as ever, but the entire band sounds sharp and focused.\n\nIn a world of growing inequality, looming ecological catastrophe, religious fundamentalism-fueled war, and mindless consumerism, FNM's biting critique is needed more than ever, cutting through complacency and the narcotic haze of commodities. That the music is itself commodified has always been one of the sources of self-deprecation of Patton and the band.\n\nThe Dillinger Escape Plan, with Patton-inspired lead singer Greg Puciato, is one of my favorite bands. I'm glad that Patton himself has stepped up again with this excellent new music!","classification":4}

{"text":"A recent analysis in Scientific Reports revealed that -- it's true -- all popular music these days sounds the same. You can look it up yourself; it was done by computers and scientists and everything. Lucky us, we live in the days of mass communication and internet technology, and although people who DON'T sound like everyone else aren't usually in the mainstream, they aren't that hard to find for those who know how to look. Hence, Yeasayer.\n\nWhen I first discovered Yeasayer, I wasn't sure what I was listening to. It sounded like the soundtrack to a water park that runs on fever dreams and which caters to old souls inside young, sun-baked bodies. That's no good, though. It's poetic and all, but who really knows what I'm talking about? The point, really, is that they're good, unusual, and you should check them out.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/ALL-HOUR-CYMBALS\/dp\/B003GYFNW2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ALL HOUR CYMBALS<\/a>&nbsp;-- 5 stars\nMore raw instrumentation than you find in most bands, their first album has the coarse-granola-sensibility of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Rusted-Root\/dp\/0793565553\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rusted Root<\/a>&nbsp;with the chaotic storytelling of an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Animal-Collective\/dp\/B001P1FZDK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Animal Collective<\/a>. Every song sounds like it was inspired by a bonfire, rocket launch, or church revival. There's an earthen, unwashed humanity to each tune, like the sound of a nerve being jangled and soothed at the same time. Standouts: \"2080\" (a bittersweet anthem with a bridge than never fails to give me goosebumps), \"No Need To Worry\" (another slow burning tune with an operatic and uplifting chord progression), and \"Red Cave\" (my favorite song of theirs so far; an incrementally aggressive mountain climber of a song that hits a dense joyful core at the end).\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/ODD-BLOOD\/dp\/B00367TZ46\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ODD BLOOD<\/a>&nbsp;- 5 stars\nThe first song leads listeners to expect something darker and uglier than their debut record. \"The Children\" sounds like it was recorded in a flooded factory and then slowed down to give the vocals a mock-Waits-ish sound. I didn't care for it when I first heard it, and still don't. However, it was immediately followed by seven absolutely stellar tunes, starting with the playful, skip-to-my-loo beats of \"Ambling Alp\" and moving through to the retro-echoes of \"Love Me Girl\" and then on to my favorite of the album, the weird and slinky \"Strange Reunions.\" Their sound is pulled closer to the chest in this album, and their vast collection of instruments is pared down in favor of more digitization, but the end result is no less uplifting or driven.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/FRAGRANT-WORLD\/dp\/B008U8CV6U\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">FRAGRANT WORLD<\/a>&nbsp;- 4 stars\nThe electronic contraction that began in ODD BLOOD is fully realized here, and the end result is unfortunately a less approachable set of songs. It's almost as if they were attempting to parody some They All Sound The Same pop songs by skewering them with their trademark inventiveness, the end result being a lot of songs that sound like they could be great if only they'd settle down and figure out where they were headed. The backgrounds, vocals, instrumentation, and digitization is at a full frenzy, with none of it really cohering into something you can really sink your teeth into. I like grim-pop-propulsion of \"Reagan's Skeleton,\" and \"Folk Hero Shtick\" is my favorite song off the album, with its bizarre braiding of a horror movie's mentality with a kid's show's pep tuned to an off key. There are only two songs I don't like (\"No Bones\" sounds like its insulting itself and \"Glass of the Microscope\" sounds like they slapped together remnants that they'd cut from four different songs), but the rest don't reach the same, grand heights as the group achieved in their previous two records. Still good, but no longer great. (Also, a head's up: I had serious downloading issues with this website's digital purchase for this album and had to get it via other means.)","classification":5}
{"text":"The son of a Kentucky musician whose own Nashville dreams never came true, John Michael Montgomery kept a bit of his daddy's hometown grit, even as he put together an impressive string of Nashville-produced hit albums and singles. This generous compilation offers twenty tracks, and collects nearly every significant hit single that Montgomery's had in his twelve year recording career.\n\nMontgomery's first hits, the ballads \"Life's a Dance\" and \"I Love the Way You Love Me,\" had a middle-of-the-road sweetness that hit an emotional chord with both record buyers and award givers -- the second single was the ACM song-of-the-year for 1993. The love songs continued in 1994 with, \"I Swear,\" as did the awards (ACM song-of-the-year and single-of-the-year). As with most of Montgomery's ballads, the country flavor is to be found almost entirely in his vocals. There's a hint of steel, but the drums-guitars-bass-keyboard backing could just as easily host a pop vocalist (in fact, the song was covered by the R&B group All-4-One and netted a grammy). It's the slight edge in Montgomery's voice, the phrasings, and the down-home sentimentality of the lyrics that brings his slow songs into the country arena.\n\nLater in 1994 his singles began to capitalize on Montgomery's uptempo numbers, charting with the rowdy country-rocker \"Be My Baby Tonight\" and the mid-tempo \"If You've Got Love.\" Both tracks kick up the twangy guitars and fiddle of a honky-tonk bred backing. His releases continued mix ballads and up-tempo tunes, including the lightning-quick auctioneer's cadence of \"Sold (The Grundy Country Auction Incident)\" and the contemplation of his father's death, \"I Miss You a Little.\" The latter, unfortunately, is missing from this collection.\n\nBy 1996 Montgomery was mostly charting ballads, variously edging more towards the center and bringing a bigger dose of his country sound down-tempo. \"Angel in My Eyes\" is more contemporary pop than country, but 1998's \"Cover You in Kisses\" has a superb melody anchored by a strong underline of steel and fiddle. Montgomery's last #1 single, 2000's \"The Little Girl\" features Alison Krauss and Dan Tyminski on harmony vocals.\n\nIn addition to seven #1s (seventeen top-5s!), this collection adds \"'Til Nothing Comes Between Us\" from the \"Pictures\" album, and a pair of newly recorded tracks: the waltz-time generation gap tale \"Cool,\" and the romantic \"One Less Day.\" This is a terrific overview and introduction to Montgomery's hitmaking career. Though it's missing the top-5 \"Cowboy Love\" and top-10 \"I Miss You a Little,\" it's probably the more complete pick over his 1997 \"Greatest Hits\" LP.","classification":4}

So when I had that Disturbed was going to do a rendition of one of Paul and Art's classic songs, The Sound Of Silence, I was very skeptical to hear whether or not they could deliver, and honestly I was absolutely blown away. Disturbed's version of the classic song, The Sound Of Silence, is honestly one of the nicest surprises in music for the past several years at all. The intimacy of the orchestration into the heavy metal tone was really with a shock. I thought this version was really a dime in a dozen.

{"text":"I read an article not too long ago about why debut albums can be so great. Chances are, the groups have been sitting around with those songs, perfecting them perhaps, for years before they are signed or have a chance to record them. Follow-up albums are usually newer material that don't have that kind of time to ferment.\n\nIn theory all this makes sense.\n\nPerhaps that is why the Counting Crows' debut 'August and Everything After' is so stellar and some of their subsequent albums have been a little more hit and miss. Each of those albums had some brilliant material but equal parts filler as well.\n\nBut now they're out with their first new material in six years (though they did an album of covers a year or so ago) with 'Somewhere Under Wonderland'.\n\nWhile there is a \"deluxe\" edition out there, it consists of two demos from album tracks. That's not really worth two extra bucks.\n\n'Somewhere Under Wonderland' is very good, but I won't go on to say it is great. It doesn't greatly deviate from much of their other work, but this time they're pulling from the better parts. And that's not to say they don't stretch here and there.\n\nI'm digging their eight-minute plus intro, \"Pallisades Park\". It reminds me of something Rickie Lee Jones would have done on 'Pirates'. That is a high compliment.\n\nThere are other good tunes: \"Earthquake Driver\", which is another song that isn't quite like anything else they've done. I like, and always have, Adam Duritz has a way with vocal phrasing and he does well with in on this song.  And I like his voice.\n\n\"Scarecrow\" seems to be the commercial centerpiece from this disk. I can see it's appeal for being somewhat familiar and people tend to gravitate to what they know. And it's fine, but it's nothing new.\n\nThe same can be said for almost all of the other six songs. The melodies are familiar but they're done well. They seemed to have cherry-picked their best elements from 'Recovering the Satellites' and 'Saturday Nights and Sunday Mornings'.\n\n\"Johnny Appleseed's Lament\" and \"Possibility Days\" are stand-outs.\n\nYes, \"Cover Up the Sun\" and \"God of Ocean Tides\" have country tinges to them, but some reviews to call them country songs is off the mark. Counting Crows have always had a song or two in this vein.\n\nFor $10 'Somewhere Under Wonderland' is a more than solid purchase.","classification":4}

In the case with Bon Jovi, they've tuned down the feeling on their latest record, in regards to a more somber feel, as with regards on their latest single. You Want To Make A Memory, the opening single from Lost Highway is a elequent melloncollie song that reflects on heartbreak and divorce, similar to what Richie Sambora had went through the past couple of years. the song really shines nicely as a down to Earth song that deals with empty and being lonely.

{"text":"If you need to fill holes in your Schumann collection, or you're looking to replace that lost or broken CD.  Or, if you've never bought a Schumann CD or MP3, then this is the collection for you - at $1.99 you can hardly go wrong.  You can't beat the price with a stick and you get hours and hours of quality music by one of the greatest Romantic composers of all time. This of course includes The Spring Symphony No. 1, as well as Symphonies 2, 3 & 4, Kinderzenen,  Kreisleriana, Moonlit Night and the Grand Sonata amongst others.  This is music at it's best!  Schumann was clearly a genius, and it shows on the tracks on this MP3 download.  Use it for relaxing, meditation, or as the background for your life.  It's simply beautiful!  His piano music is especially divine.\n\nFOR THE MUSIC PURISTS:  Use this to fill holes in your collection - it's so cheap, it's almost like stealing.  There's so much here that you can't go wrong, even if some aren't perfectly executed.\n\nFOR EVERYONE ELSE: Use this to build your collection.  There are at least 8 other MP3 downloads like this one which would start the basis for a lovely classical music library. If you get to the point where a piece doesn't sound right, or bothers you in any way, go out and explore alternatives.  There are tons out there.  What I like, you may not, and vice versa.  For example, the only people I like play Rachmaninoff are Rachmaninoff and Mischa Dikter.  Yet, I'm told a lot of people play him well - I just don't agree.  It's all personal taste.  Take recommendations, but figure out what you like yourself.\n\n At $1.99 each, that makes it under $18.00 to have 1800 tracks of 9 classical masters, ranging from Bach to Debussy.  You can't even buy a family of 4 fastfood for that little.  Or you could buy 18 tracks on i-tunes, not 1800.  I can tell you, I did it, and it's been the soundtrack to the greater part of my life since I did so.  It especially makes wonderful background music while reading anything from fiction to nonfiction - and of course making dinner.  You can't beat this deal - just buy this!  Buy all of them!  Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Grieg, Mozart, Schubert, Schumann, Tchaikovsky, Composer Compilation","classification":5}

{"text":"This is Weezer's first ever album, and I think it's pretty good. I think Raditude might be my first favorite. I think this is a good album for anybody who needs a nice rockin' tune to listen to, but it's not quite hard-rock enough to be like Nirvana or Smashing Pumpkins. The music is also very creative and original, much different from all the grunge that was released back in 1994. Best of all, it's timeless! Each song has at least something to say about it.\n\n\"My Name is Jonas\" might be a song about the singer's brother, since the actual singer's name is Rivers. A punk rock song with a light guitar intro. The only bad thing is that the rhythm is kind of hard to find at first.\n\nThe Amazon sample for \"No One Else\" says \"My girl's got eyeballs,\" but the whole line is \"My girl's got eyeballs in the back of her head.\" The music is fun, catchy, and a little simple.\n\n\"The World Has Turned And Left Me Here\" is so Weezer-y, you can almost immediately tell who sang it if you hear it for the first time on the radio. I would've given it a 5\/5, but it kind of got old after a while.\n\n\"Buddy Holly\" is Awesome! Does Rivers really look like Buddy Holly? Kinda, kinda not.\n\nNext comes \"Undone\", which isn't the kind of song that's meant to be played on the radio. It starts of as a pretty decent Weezer song, but it's a bit long. Rivers starts singing at 0:52 [after a conversation sound-clip with two people] and stops singing at around 3:20, then the music gets annoyingly intense at 3:52. Once it dies down, we just start hearing some microphone feedback and some ominous piano chords. I think it'd be much better off without them.\n\n\"Surf Wax America\" is a nice song that makes you want to go surfing [or take your board to work, as Rivers says]. But like the previous song, it has something that I wish it didn't have--the middle section. I know they're trying to sound cool and slowed down, but why is it so quiet?! I heard Holiday before this one, so I thought Holiday was the only song to have a middle section like that, which would make it seem more original. [Before I bought this album I had the songs Buddy Holly, Undone, Say It Ain't So, and Holiday] Other than that, I guess it's cool song.\n\nNext comes \"Say It Ain't So\". This one has everything that a Weezer fan would like; Pretty good lyrics, rockin' chorus, guitar solo, and it's really catchy. Say it IS so!\n\nSomebody said that \"In The Garage\" this one is an anthem for nerds\/ rock 'n' roll lovers, and I might have to agree. It's my favorite song on the album. I like the intro because it sounds so different from the rest of the song. [Is that a bagpipe?]\n\n\"Holiday\" is a bluesy song about setting off for adventure. Yes, it has a middle section, but much louder and better than the one SWA had.\n\n\"Only in Dreams\" is the finishing song, and it sounds EXACTLY like Undone at first, but it later starts to sound like a big mix of every other song on the album, so it makes a great last song [8 minutes]. But it had a lot of mic feedback at the end and Rivers stopped singing early again, so I'm not so sure about it. It got quiet like Surf Wax America and Holiday, but that's not exactly a middle section, since no one was singing, and because it happened towards the end. Long story short, it's a good last song, though it kind of sounds like Undone. [5\/10]\n\nNow for the bonus tracks:\n\nFor \"Mykel and Carley\", I'm not so sure who Mykel and Carley are, but the song was great! It had a guitar intro that reminded me of the intro for My Name is Jonas. Unusually it was also a bonus track for the band's newest album, Death to False Metal.\n\n\"Jamie\" is Just boring. Enough said.\n\nHowever, \"Susanne\" is Another great hit from Weezer!]\n\nFinally, we have \"PaperFace\". I have no idea what that means, but the actual song was just annoying. Rivers starts off singing quietly, until the tension in his voice builds up and enters the chorus. The chorus really annoyed me because Rivers is screaming his lungs out while the rest of the band is banging as hard as they can on their instruments. Once AGAIN, there's another middle section. Just don't really like it.","classification":4}

He came back with Toni Braxton a few years ago, and they both released Love, Marriage & Divorce, which wasn't a bad record for the two of them. But for himself, he has needed to write better for his solo work. We've Got Love, which is the lead single from his latest album, Return Of The Tender Lover, isn't a bad song for die hard Babyface buffs, but overall not a must download for new fans of his music. The song does show his style nobly but not really anything to thrive into that \"wow, I must own this song\" factor. Still, he has had great songs before, like When Can I See You Again. But overall, there can be better from Babyface down the road.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3}

{"text":"After a hiatus from music, Matchbox Twenty\/20 is back in business, at least for this half best-of\/ep, then it's back to the solo work. So, you could look at this as their comeback song, and it greatly tides over our thirst for everything MB20. First off, the lyrics are incredible just like they are with any MB20 song, with lyrics like, \"I'm waking up at the start of the end of the world\/ but it feels just like every other morning before.\" The song is catchy and well-written, and overall just well done. And even though this is a rather successful single, it doesn't really sound it. In fact, most of the best songs on their albums were singles anyhow. The bridge is also great musically, and the only thing that could get me down on this song is the chorus. While it is a great chorus for concerts, and to get you pumping, it just seems like more could have been done to it.\n\nBut overall, a great song, a great single, a great group. Here's to hoping MB20 comes back much sooner rather than later. We need new material here!","classification":5}

Overall, the album is both, powerful and beautiful. Starting with a \"21 things I want in a love\" full of force, it goes on to do some of Alanis' most beautiful works with \"Flinch,\" \"So Unsexy\" and \"You owe me nothing in return,\" all of which are bound to become great hits, I'm sure.

{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Musiq and have followed his career from its beginning and even though I didn't immediately warm up to the lead single, ANYTHING I still bought the cd because I just knew that there'd be songs for me to fall in love with.\n\nOnce I got the cd I was initially very disappointed to see that Musiq didn't work with long-time writing & production collaborators, Ivan Barias & Carvin Haggins - I just think that they are \"dialed in\" to Musiq as an artist and create magical songs together.  I do, however respect Musiq for working with new producers because it could get stale working with the same people over and over so I was curious to hear the direction of this album.  One great thing is that Musiq's hallmark of singing about love & relationships remains - he is one of few young guys who have respectful and honest lyrics about love from a man's perspective and I appreciate that.\n\nOn to the album -\n\nANYTHING w\/ Swizz Beats - I like this track moreso for the sample used, I'm not a Swizz fan but he doesn't take over the track.  Being able to see the video so many times prior to the album release really helped me warm up to the song.\n\nSINGLE - heavy synthy beats used kind of overshadow his vocals, not a fave.\n\nSAY I DO - Musiq is singing at the very height of his range which I found extremely unpleasant to listen to.  This just doesn't sound like Musiq and I strongly dislike this track.\n\nLOVE CONTRACT and SILVER & GOLD - both are reminiscent of 60's sounds, I love the instrumentation & arrangement of both which give the tracks an old school\/nu school feel.\n\nWAITING STILL - again Musiq is singing in a very high key which to me is very unpleasant to hear.  I don't like this track although the sentiment of the lyrics as with SINGLE are nice, his singing is \"no muy bueno\".\n\nBACKTOWHERE - midtempo, melodic track that has a somewhat busy production but on which Musiq's vocals shine.\n\nDOWEHAVETO - love the musical arrangement.\n\nBEFRIENDS - heartfelt lyrics about a relationship breakup from a man's perspective.\n\nYES & MEDICINE - melodic & accessible tracks on which Musiq sound great.\n\nLIKETHESUN - although the production is very busy and seems to compete with his vocals, his voice isn't truly overshadowed and I really like this track.\n\nMusiq has been in this industry for 10 years now so he has definitely created a lane for himself that has made me love his music; as I mentioned earlier I appreciate his working with other producers to shake up his sound.  I was initially disappointed that there wasn't a ballad or two that instantly spoke to my heart but overall there is enough good stuff on the album that I can recommend it to fans.","classification":4}

{"text":"The Fabulous Swing Collection is one of the better single CD compilations we have of great swing music that took the country by storm in the 1930s and 1940s. This music still sounds great today; and many people have fond memories of the times they danced to these tunes when they were often performed live in dance halls and nightclubs. The quality of the sound is really rather good and I like the artwork.\n\nBenny Goodman & His Orchestra open things up with a great rendition of \"Don't Be That Way (Take 1).\" The horn works very well for this number and Benny's band never lets us down! They do this flawlessly; and it sounds great even today. Glenn Miller & His Orchestra follow with their smash hit entitled \"In the Mood.\" \"In the Mood\" is a number people remember well; this got lots of air play and many people danced to it back in the day. Similarly, \"Opus One\" by Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra never disappoints; \"Opus One\" is a peppy little number that packs a huge, unforgettable punch and I always like hearing \"Opus One.\"\n\nGlen Gray & His Orchestra (with whom I'm less familiar) also make good with their hit, \"Casa Loma Stomp.\" \"Casa Loma Stomp\" has a great beat and they never play a superfluous note! Great! Of course, we can't have a swing CD without the great Duke Ellington and his buddies doing their wonderful \"Take the `A' Train;\" \"Take the `A' Train\" hit the clubs big time and when you hear it you'll instantly know why. A personal favorite of mine is \"Minnie the Moocher\" by the incomparable Cab Calloway & His Cotton Club Orchestra; Cab Calloway could really swing and that Cotton Club was all the better off for it!\n\nListen also for \"Back Bay Shuffle\" by Artie Shaw & His Orchestra; Artie Shaw instinctively knew how to make great music and \"Back Bay Shuffle\" showcases his talents nicely. There's even a special number from Glenn Miller again when he and his buddies play \"A String Of Pearls.\" \"A String Of Pearls\" sounds like pearls should sound--and that's quite all right by me. \"Swingin' Uptown\" by Jimmie Lunceford & His Orchestra is great; but they could have omitted \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" by Fletcher Henderson & His Orchestra. Oh, well--no CD is perfect.\n\nThe CD ends very nicely. We get two solid numbers, \"Flyin' Home\" performed by Charlie Barnet & His Orchestra and then \"Sing, Sing, Sing (With A Swing) (Parts 1 & 2)\" by Benny Goodman & His Orchestra. \"Sing, Sing, Sing (With A Swing) (Parts 1 & 2)\" is classic swing music at its very apex and I think you'll like it very much if you haven't heard this one before.\n\nThis album is a great starter CD for people just getting into swing music; and it makes an affordable single CD swing music compilation, too. If you like this you should consider other CDs of swing music available for sale on this website.","classification":5}

{"text":"Nobody can deny Ron Isley's `legend' status by any means; the man - through The Isley Bros. has more hits than many new artists will ever have.  With a beautifully, sensual sounding tenor in his possession,  Isley possesses a golden voice - one of the best of our time.  On recent outings, `Mr. Biggs' has held it all together, continuing to `reinvent' himself just as he has throughout his long career with The Isley Bros.  Some will be quick to clarify this is Isley's second solo album (After 2003's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Here-I-Am\/dp\/B0000C9ZK5\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Here I Am<\/a>), but keep in mind recent efforts focus mostly on the soul legend exclusively.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Mr-I\/dp\/B003YOMN8G\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mr I<\/a>, his fifth studio release of the new millennium (following 2001`s&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Eternal\/dp\/B00005N8UV\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Eternal<\/a>, 2003's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Body-Kiss\/dp\/B0000931OT\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Body Kiss<\/a>&nbsp;and Here I Am: Isley Meets Bacharach, and 2006's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Baby-Makin-Music-Feat-Ronald-Isley-AKA-Mr-Biggs\/dp\/B000BY8278\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Baby Makin' Music (Feat. Ronald Isley AKA Mr. Biggs)<\/a>, excluding 2007's holiday effort) falls short of an `upswing' for Isley.  While Mr. I should serve as the perfect `comeback' album after Isley's bout with cancer and imprisonment for tax evasion, it is merely an average addition to his discography.  Even the better cuts from Mr. I fail to capitalize on the momentum set by his previous three studio efforts with his brothers.  The missing link? R. Kelly, whose songwriting and production talents truly helped to make Isley sound incredibly fresh and relevant without sounding ill with modern, gimmicky R&B.\n\nThe album opens with \"Take It How You Want It,\" which is enjoyable, but not valedictory.  The cut feels a bit restrained and undercooked compared to strong opening cuts from previous efforts: \"Move Your Body\" (Eternal), \"Superstar\" (Body Kiss) or \"You're My Star (Baby Makin' Music).  A little more pizzazz may have made \"Take It How You Want It\" more captivating.  Promo single \"No More\" is better, using guitar to give the cut a nice adult R&B feel. Despite being arguably the best cut from the album, it feels surprisingly restrained as well.  A solid chorus makes it worthwhile: \"So I'm never gonna let you go\/they don't make `em like you no more... It's like an old school 64\/they don't make `em like you no more.\"\n\n\"If I Lose My Woman\" feels undercooked as well, which is unfortunate.  \"Put Your Money On Me\" features an uninspired rap performance by T.I., which fails to aid in Mr. Biggs's lot.  The track is too modern for Isley, even if it sort of works.  Vocally, Isley feels to restrained, as if he cannot let his beautiful, sensual vocals encapsulate the track because of its nature.  \"Supposed To Do\" is by no means a `savior,' but it reigns the production team in to give Isley a track that better suits him with more of an adult-contemporary R&B vibe.  Despite this, a reference to `facebook' again questions if producers are `trying too hard' to make an already relevant artist (age or not) more relevant in the music industry of today.  If that's the case, call in R. Kelly to pen another hit for Mr. Biggs.\n\n\"Dance for Me\" is the first cut in a while that works perfectly with Isley, reviving the 80s sound that Isley cultivated with hit \"Between the Sheets.\"  \"What I Miss The Most\" is a strong slow jam, though it indulges the slightest bit too much becoming draggy by the finish.  \"I Need You\" is fine, with a quicker tempo and a catchily penned chorus.  Again, it is by no means `the second coming' but it is one of the albums better cuts.\n\n\"You've Got a Friend\" pairs the soul singer with fellow soul star Aretha Franklin for a duet that is solid, though not exceptional.  The chemistry is pretty close, particularly towards the end, but it never `gels' into the `perfect' performance.  Closing cut \"You Had Me At Hello\" is solid and smartly closes the effort with a slow jam - Isley's strong point.\n\nOverall, Mr. I is a flawed effort. It is always nice to hear a soul legend, regardless of the quality, but Isley has had much better efforts in recent times than this one.  This effort proves to be only lukewarm, which is disappointing after a four-year hiatus.  That said, Mr. Biggs's still has it, if anybody was questioning that.  He'd REALLY still have it with better material, however.","classification":3}

{"text":"Honestly, and I will say this, I am not a huge fan of rap music. But when it has came down to Snoop Dogg, he has honestly the longevity that most rap artists would honestly envy to have, and that is just distinction. He has been rapping for twenty years, and has a lot of love in his craft that so many artists could even be desired in his life. Nevertheless, he has had some mixed songs, he has had the appeal of swiftness that still stands the test of time. Since he broke out with Nuttin But A G Thing with Dr. Dre years ago, it was a surprise to see him still standing. His latest song, Peaches N' Cream with Charlie Wilson is actually his catchiest in over a decade. His collaboration with Charlie Wilson is actually a surprise to my own ears, and one of his best songs. While I didn't like him switching it up as Snoop Lion awhile ago, this song is worth downloading for any die hard fan of his work, and newcomers to his swiftness and rap alike.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4}

Her earlier work, including hits \"I'm Like a Bird\" and \"Powerless\" were fun and entertaining songs (and Nelly is a very attractive, appealing artist), but they didn't excite the mass audiences.  They had more appeal to the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\n  2006 saw the debut of her song \"Promiscuous\", where she teamed with Justin Timberlake and super-producer, Timbaland, to create this raw, sexually charged song that showed that Nelly was a bona fide sex symbol, instead of just being a cool hipster.  Timbaland's beats have always been among the best in the business.  However, Nelly's clever raps and strong vocals take \"Promiscuous\" to another level, as in all the way to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. This set the tone for the remainder of her album \"Loose\", which showed her new image to be genuine instead of posed.","classification":5}

I hate London Hymn which sounds like a church song with a creepy choir.  Good songs are L'Ora and Higher Window (although lyrics sound religious - yuck) and Hidden Away is good.  Josh:  Let David Foster produce your next album!  He is an annoying egotist - but knows how to produce - especially your kind of music.  Also, many of the songs on this and your last CD have simple, cheesy lyrics set to waltz rhythms which become too sing-songy.  Get a good lyracist.  Groban should have won 10 Grammies by now.

{"text":"I have never been a fan of country music, and I suppose John Fogerty isn't considered country. No, he's more country rock--a genre that has all but died out with the 70's. Yet it is Fogerty and Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR) that hooked me into anything resembling country or country rock music along with The Eagles. Each Fogerty album is an experiment with something new. I have no expectations for history repeating when I listen to Fogerty, and there's just something about his music that's always solid.\n\n\"The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again\" introduced some new songs and artists that I otherwise would have never listened to. Now I know John Prine has been around since 1971, but I had never listened to anything from him, and I could not for the life of me name any songs from him either. \"Paradise\" is a well written song, and I like how Fogerty plays it. I also had heard the name Bonnie & Delany but never listened to them either. I can't say that I am a big fan of \"Never Ending Song Of Love\". It seemed rather one note to me. I am familiar with Rick Nelson's 1972 hit \"Garden Party\" and I think this is one of Fogerty's finest interpretations here. Superbly performed with Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmidt. I might even like it better than Rick Nelson's version! I had never heard of Buck Owens, nor had I heard \"I Don't Care (Just As Long As You Love Me)\". I can't say that I am a fan. Again, a rather one note song. I am very familiar with John Denver's \"Back Home Again\", and try as I might, I found Fogerty's version lacking. You really can't touch John Denver. He brought something very special to his music, and he was one of a kind. Fogerty does a serviceable job with it, it's just nothing special. I had never heard of Ray Price or \"I'll Be There (If You Ever Want Me)\", and I must say that I like Fogerty's choice, and it piqued my interest in Price.\n\nI don't know what to make of Fogerty doing Fogerty on a revision of \"Change In The Weather\" from his 1986 \"Eye Of The Zombie\" album. I've always liked the song to begin with, and this new version didn't really add or subtract anything from the original version. I like the original better. I know who Pat Boone is, but I never listened to his music, but \"Moody River\" is one of the highlights here. Fogerty does a great job with this song, and it's a well written piece. It's surprising to me that in 1961 this song was a hit considering the subject matter. I had never heard of The Kendalls or their 1977 song \"Heaven's Just A Sin Away\", and I thought it was pleasant, but nothing special here. Another Ray Price song, \"Falling Falling Falling\" was okay, not great. Jumpin' Gene Simmons' 1964 hit \"Haunted House\" was just okay. I know Fogerty and Springsteen singing together for the first time on The Everly Brothers 1960 hit \"When Will I Be Loved\" was supposed to be a main draw here, and I like all three artists, but this comes across overdone.\n\nSo, a three and a half star album. Above average, but not quite great. Here's how this compares to Fogerty's back catalog:\n\n1968 Creedence Clearwater Revival: Three Stars\n1969 Born On The Bayou: Three and a Half Stars\n1969 Green River: Five Stars\n1969 Willie And The Poor Boys: Five Stars\n1970 Cosmo's Factory: Four Stars\n1970 Pendulum: Three and a Half Stars\n1972 Mardi Gras: One Star\n1973 The Blue Ridge Rangers: Three and a Half Stars\n1975 John Fogerty: Out Of Print!

Sir Elton does double duty, growling out the vocals on their forceful cover of \"Oh, Well,\" which opens the album, and 2Cellos covering his \"Candle In The Wind.\" Other guests include classical pianist Lang Lang, Italian pop elder Zucchero (on an unexpected Italian-language remake of the Magnetic Fields gem, \"The Book Of Love\") and Stevie Vai, who adds electric guitar ooompf to \"Highway To Hell.\" Now, part of me thinks, \"oh, I've already heard this&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/when-Kronos-Quartet-did-Hendrix\/dp\/B000005IXL\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">when Kronos Quartet did Hendrix<\/a>\" but I was surprised by some of the sonics here, particularly how well Vai's plucked, electrified guitar gels with the bowed cellos, revealing a shared resonance between the two varieties of stringed instruments.

{"text":"I reviewed the green-version CD when it came out.  I'm saddened beyond words at the untimely loss of Peter Steele just last week.  I'm convinced he had a lot of great music ahead of him.  That said, it's my opinion that he went out absolutely on top with \"Dead Again\".  When this disc came out, I listened to it nearly continuously for two years--no lie.  I've never had such a strong reaction to any Type O Negative CD, not even \"Bloody Kisses\" and \"October Rust\", my two other favorites.  While there may be some Type O fans who might disagree with me, \"Dead Again\" is so phenomenal that it's practically beyond criticism.  The \"highs\" have never been higher, and the overall level of quality is tremendous, with the exception of \"She Burned Me Down\" which seems to go on a bit pointlessly.  Standout tracks include \"Dead Again,\" \"Tripping A Blind Man,\" \"Profits of Doom,\" \"September Sun,\" \"These Three Things,\" \"An Ode To Locksmiths,\" and \"All Hail And Farewell To Britain.\"\n\nI could be barking up the wrong tree, but I've long thought that Peter Steele has to have had significant exposure to classical music.  This isn't a new opinion for me, but his development as a songwriter suggests to me he was drawing on an awareness of symphonic masters.  Two tracks in particular bear this out.\n\n\"September Sun\" is an astonishing song that became something of an obsession.  The very first time I heard track four, I literally groaned and said to myself, \"they can't be serious!\"  \"September Sun\" starts like a \"hair band\" power ballad, with a simple nice piano intro--totally not Type O. And then it occurred to me, knowing that this is Peter Steele, this has to be a joke and it's going to get turned inside out and trashed. And actually something very different happens.  Steele does something profoundly Brucknerian with \"September Sun\"--he takes a very simple basic theme, expands upon it, puts it through a metamorphosis, and it ends up becoming something far more imposing, grander, astonishing, and even menacing, than you can have even been lead to believe it would become, by the time the song is over nearly 10 minutes later, and really takes you somewhere. \"September Sun\" has to be heard in its astonishing entirety, and for me it is an especially imposing, threatening, beautiful, and entirely unnerving piece of music. It haunts me while still blowing me away.\n\n\"These Three Things\" is also a musical standout (I usually don't pay attention to the words, and listening to Peter Steele rant against abortion is more humorous than anything else--and it was not intended as a joke).  At just under 15 minutes, it's the longest song that Type O ever recorded.  And unlike some of their lengthier songs which are really just a collection of several smaller songs strung together, \"These Three Things\" takes musical ideas and works them out over the length of the song, transforming them by the end.  Beyond the drone introduction, the initial section of the song is musically one of the most brutal things that Type O has ever done--relentless, overpowering, and raw.  And then the music takes a 180, introduces a new musical theme, and then transforms it over the remainder of the song.  I wasn't overwhelmed by \"These Three Things\" initially, but almost more than any other song on this CD, it grew on me to the point of becoming one of the very highlights.\n\nI've long had the opinion that \"Dead Again\" is Type O Negative's finest work--which is not to diminish \"Bloody Kisses\" or \"October Rust\" in any way, as great as they are.  In \"Dead Again,\" Type O pushed themselves hard, not settling to re-do what they have already done, and I think they made real breakthroughs and succeeded on every level.\n\nTo Peter Steele, let me say this:  THANK YOU, Peter, for giving us such outstanding music.  Words will never express how grateful I am.  I also feel very fortunate to have seen Type O play live numerous times.  You didn't do it by yourself, Type O clearly was a band, not a man with three backup players, but you were the creative force, the vision, and the voice.  I will be listening to your music likely for the rest of my life, and I have no doubt it will stand the test of time.  Many musicians have made a name for themselves, but few have had the capacity for such an original vision, and the talent to achieve it.  You did, and I thank you for that from the bottom of my heart.  At the end of several of a number of Type O's concerts, you would say right before leaving, while grasping your heart, \"Thank you, for without you, we are nothing,\" and it never came across as anything but heartfelt.  Hearing more about you after your passing, about your truly humble nature, I am more sure than ever that those words were your truth.  But my truth is, it was not you in our debt, but the other way around.  We are lucky to have had you sharing your gift with us.  Thank you, Peter.  If there is an \"other side\" (and I have a hard time believing there is), I hope you had a good journey and are at peace.  You deserve it.  Peace, Green Man.","classification":5}

The beauty of Coconut lies not in its complexity or talented performance but in the fact that it is a catchy tune that you just can't seem to forget. You will find yourself singing it or thinking about it because it is a song that elicits positive feelings. It is also a favorite to randomly tuck in a movie somewhere. Is it essential? Probably not but you should still have it.","classification":4}

{"text":"Papa Roach is great at making exemplary music. All of the songs on this album are different from each other, but none of them stray too far from the feel of the album. Nothing feels out of place. From Gravity to Fear Hate Love, this album is well written and fulfilling. The upbeatness of Warriors, the epiphany-like drive of War Over Me, the inspiration given in Face Everything and Rise, the emotional rollercoaster in Gravity,  the strongly presented accusation in Devil, and the longing for help in Falling Apart is, at the least, what makes this album more than just music, but a piece of life.","classification":5}

{"text":"The Dissent of Man, the latest effort from Bad Religion, may admittedly be disappointing to some fans.  Many of the songs are mid-tempo numbers, lacking some speed; however, these songs are not lacking in melody, power, and drive.  Of these mid-tempo tunes, the first single, \"The Devil in Stitches,\" is my personal favorite track on the album, with \"Cyanide\" and \"Pride and the Pallor\" close behind.  \"The Resist Stance\" opens with a Sabbath-esque guitar riff; it works well as an intro to this great song.  \"Won't Somebody,\" which first appeared as an acoustic number on the deluxe edition of \"New Maps of Hell,\" is given a band arrangement here that works well.  And, songs such as \"The Day that the Earth Stalled,\" \"Wrong Way Kids,\" and \"Meeting of the Minds\" display speed and force.  Throughout the disc, Greg Graffin's verbiage and the \"oozin' ahs\" of Brett Gurewitz and Jay Bentley are present like old friends.\n\nI find The Dissent of Man a worthy successor to New Maps of Hell.  It's too early to say where it will land in my order of favorites, but I suspect it will be high in the list.  Highly recommended.","classification":5}

{"text":"Muse certainly has a gift for the unexpected - each release different, yet familiar all in the same. Drones is no exception - the utilitarian packaging and drab colored cover artwork the first indication that this would be a departure (both in presentation and sound) from the slick and glossy nature of the The 2nd Law. And while it's still slick\/glossy at times (\"Dead Inside\") most of this is a return to good commercial rock sensibility. The great riff and catchiness of \"Psycho\" sets the tone for the rest of this dystopian concept record. And in that regard it's great to see a band with this much influence in the pop music culture make a recording that works best by actually listening from start to finish - the way many of us who grew up in the 70's with vinyl still prefer to listen to music.\n\nMuse has always reminded me of Queen in so many ways - in the way they incorporate so many musical styles and cultural trends into their music - and with this very diverse collection of songs  Muse succeeds in this regard, yet all the while maintaining their own style\/sound\/attitude. \"Reapers\" is a great example - the song sounds like Van Halen (opening lead solo) meets Aerosmith (riff in the chorus section) but then \"Muse\" kicks in during the middle section solo section with the crazy effects. Similarly, \"The Handler\" and the epic \"The Globalist\" dazzle with quite a bit of musical wizardry. \"Mercy\" is probably one of the strongest songs on the record where the music perfectly enhances lyrics. The spoken parts are a bit distracting (and at times unnecessary) but I will say that hearing JFK's speech is eerie - very prophetic - and I like the interspersed sound effects on that track. And on the track which follows, \"Defector,\" the Queen-like chorus is nicely juxtaposed to the Muse quirkiness. Of course, Bellamy's love and respect for classical music shines forth with the cleverly and ingeniously arranged version of Da Palestrina's \"Sanctus and Benedictus.\" Overall, Drones easily represents their best work since Black Holes and Revolutions and this just keeps getting better with repeated play.","classification":5}

{"text":"After Diana Ross and the Supremes, Martha Reeves & the Vandellas were Motown's biggest female stars.  But whereas the Supremes offered listeners sophistication the music of Reeves was more in the gospel tradition.  Reeves got her big break when she was a secretary at Motown and Mary Wells failed to show up for a recording session.  The song, \"I'll Have to Let Him Go,\" which is not included in this collection, was the first song credited to the suddenly created Martha & the Vandellas.  The original Vandellas were Annette Sterling and Rosalind Holmes, although the lineup changed over the years; the name came from combining a couple of Detroit favorites, Van Dyke Street and local singer Della Reese).  The group's second single \"Come and Get These Memories\" made the Top 5 of the R&B charts and the girls were on their way.  Other Top 5 hits included \"Dancing in the Street,\" \"\"Nowhere to Run,\" \"Jimmy Mack,\" \"I'm Ready for Love,\" \"(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave,\" and \"Honey Chile.\"  These danceable R&B hits made Martha & the Vandellas the chief rivals to the Supremes until 1968, when Reeves had a nervous breakdown after a bad acid trip.  The group disbanded after a farewell concert in Detroit in 1973 and after an undistinguished solo career away from Motown, Reeves was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Class of 1995.  This Millennium Collection offers up all of the group's hits, but is limited to only 11 cuts.  Consequently, while this album certainly covers the basics there is more of Martha & the Vandellas out there for you to enjoy.","classification":4}

{"text":"Krokus recorded their masterpiece of metal album,\"Headhunter\" in 1983. The third track was \"Screaming In The Night.\"\nEasily one of their best songs, but it also ranks as one of the best epic heavy metal tracks ever. It begins with the whispering sound of the North Wind and you can hear a lonely guitar fading in with the bass, drums,  and finally the amazing vocals of Marc Storace. Truly a landmark song for this Swiss metal band. Unfortunately, their albums that followed were more \"radio friendly\" and the \"pop\" curse,  which affected so many heavy metal bands prevented Krokus from gaining any more major headlining and any new fans. Still a classic track after all these years!","classification":5}

He spits a real ill verse and doesn't miss ONE BEAT!\n\nEminem does good in this song too.

{"text":"It used to be played regularly even up to the 90s and 2000s in my 2nd hometown, Baguio the mountain resort city where there was a station whose catch motto was The Gentle Wind. At the time, I kept hunting for it at music shops looking for the song of that title only to be met by sellers with a \"Huh?\" The original version was sung by Welch while he was with Fleetwood Mac but undoubtedly this solo (with background vocals) is the better version. Perhaps he felt that the version done by his group didn't do justice to his composition and I agree. I don't like the cover visual of the LP\/disc though. What's with that cigar. it reminds me of a sad White House scandal.","classification":4}
{"text":"Its been twelve years since the hip-hop men of De La Soul released their last LP (The Grind Date, 2004) so it makes sense that they would require a Kickstarter campaign to fund their new works. And The Anonymous Nobody (Aug 26\/AOI), their eighth and latest studio album as a full posse, serves all the great De La idiosyncrasies with some diversity of music and good guests for an all around solid retro-esque rap offering.\n\nThese aging De La Soul artists (Posdnuos, Dave and Maseo) are low-key in energy and volume most of the time, but their rhyme games are still respectably sharp. Its not bad that the general tone is warm. Platitudes and wise adages are sprinkled on their verses like the occasional gray hairs you might find on the authors scalps. The majority of the album is spent just kicking it it seems, as these legends casually toss their rhymes down with ease and skill. On their minds are past loves (Memory Of Us), the trappings of the fast glamorous busy life (Greyhounds), the problem with snooty people (Nosed Up) and hopes that we the people will go out into the world and do good (Exodus).\n\nThe production is right up there with the vocals in substance, befitting of the De La Soul brand. Highfalutin horns drape Royalty Capes, a variation of electro-funk brings the Pain, and Lord Intended is drawn out with firm rock guitar lines. A couple more joints (Drawn and Here In After) also feature those semi-extended swaths of instrumental music with cool controlled jazz featured in the last example and penultimate track.\n\nAbove all though, fans need to ask themselves if in this album there is the boundary-pushing and trend-setting of De Las early 1990s past. There really isnt, but they're also probably not trying to be cutting-edge also. In some parts, they're really not talking about anything out of the ordinary in particular, but they're also not causing harm with their words so it could be much worse. Its very comforting to hear the welcome sounds of De La Soul again no question. And The Anonymous Nobody is definitely not as middling or poor as a below average rating would suggest, but its also not wildly extraordinary. Overall we have a mediocre hip-hop album for the standards of these days and times, but the effort is very much appreciated.","classification":3}

{"text":"The intoxicating introduction to, Desire, with its two distinctive and pulsing instrumental voices, entices the listener into this song.  As additional members of the band join in, the state of anticipation builds, luring you into music which you simply cannot resist, like a Sirens song.  When Meg Meyers begins to sing, with her silky smooth and sensual vocals dripping with passion, you're completely drawn in.\n\nAnd then the unexpected and somewhat shocking lyrics begin.  I found myself thinking, Did she really just sing that?  Presumably, however, the lyrics are metaphorical.  For instance, one can assume that most people don't want to kill their lover.  Regardless, the rating of explicit is unquestionably correct for this song.  If you're the type of person offended by the f word (which suits this song, by the way), don't bother listening to this song.\n\nMs. Meyers is clearly in touch with the sensual side of her nature, and taps into those emotions for this song.  While songs about passion and desire are commonplace, this one manages to set itself off from the crowd through lyrics that go way beyond suggestive to explicit.  The throbbing music and the sensuous guitar solo (that seems to ache with longing) merely heighten the unexpected effects of this song.\n\nNote: I received this song a part of a free promotional download, and did not promise anything in return.","classification":5}

Every single song on this CD is a perfect 10, and every single tune is heavy as hell (except for Call of the Katula, but it does some crunching at the end) There is no way that Metallica will ever give us a release like this again. True the Master of Puppets is great to, but I don't think it quite measures up to Ride the Lightning.

{"text":"It is too bad that when SINGERS eventually cover the recent music of Lucinda Williams they will have better sounding versions than do the originals as 'sung' by Lucinda.  I have no idea why she has chosen to slur and mumble through her songs, but she has and her vocals make the songs not worthy of listening to them.  The instrumental portion of LW's music is great, but her vocals keep me from buying this crap.  Bob Dylan's voice sucks donkey dongs. So, it is not hard to understand why he sings the way he does.  On the other hand, Lucinda has (at least she used to have) a very good voice and why she would record her vocals as she does is beyond me.  I suppose it's because some worshipers still buy this drivel.","classification":2}

{"text":"Although Tank recently released the sequel to his 2007 album \"Sex, Love & Pain\", the album's origins actually date back to 2009. At that time, he was signed to Blackground Records and recorded it under the title \"Sex, Love & Pain II: The All Night Experience\". He had most of the production handled by Tim & Bob with a couple of songs produced by Bryan-Michael Cox and the rest he would handle himself. Unfortunately, Blackground was dealing with financial issues and as a result, \"Sex, Love & Pain II: The All Night Experience\" would end up being shelved as Blackground later folded. He signed to Atlantic Records in 2010 and released two decidedly marginal efforts \"Now Or Never\" and \"This Is How I Feel\". However, as Tank was approaching middle age, he wanted to do an album that was more mature and artsy - the end result would be 2014's \"Stronger\". While it was a step in the right direction, Atlantic's handling of the album - coupled with Tank's ill-advised comments on colorism on social media - sunk the project before it got off the ground. Despite being well received by many people, \"Stronger\" only managed to move 14,000 units in the first week. Tank then wrote an emotionally charged rant on Instagram where he vowed that he would never do a straight ahead R&B album again.\n\nIn early 2016, he made good on his promise with \"Sex, Love & Pain II\". Although the liner notes state that this is a clear continuation of its predecessor, one can't help but notice the blatant pandering to a younger audience - which is weird for an artist to make an appeal for a demographic that's half his age. Most of the production is handled by Tank alongside Brandon \"B.A.M.\" Alexander, who previously worked with him on TGT's \"Three Kings\" as well as Tyrese's recent albums \"Open Invitation\" and \"Black Rose\". Tank opens up the album with the title track, which leads into the first single, the Wale featured \"You Don't Know\", which works in a sample of Patti LaBelle's 1983 hit \"If Only You Knew\". He gets help from Rich Homie Quan on \"She Wit The S***\" and collaborates with Chris Brown and Sage The Gemini on \"BDay\". He brags on his sexual prowess on the ballad \"F***in' Wit Me\" and seduces a woman that he hopes to make his significant other on \"Relationship Goals\". Yo Gotti makes an appearance on \"I Luv Ya\", while Tank deals with the consequences of his behavior on \"So Cold\". He makes a case to change his ways on the ballad \"Better For You\" and gets help from Boyz II Men member Shawn Stockman on \"Already In Love\". Overall, \"Sex, Love & Pain II\" is a rather underwhelming record from Tank. One of the biggest problems he's had as an artist was wanting be like others as opposed to himself. The irony is that he mocked singer Brian McKnight for the parody record \"If You're Ready To Learn\", only to end up doing the exact kind of music that he ridiculed McKnight for. In any case, this album leaves a lot to be desired - both musically and lyrically.","classification":3}

It has the bouncy, nicely stylized \"Imagination,\" the gritty, bopping funk number \"Sticky Wicket,\" and the beautiful adult contemporary hit \"After All\" which is very stylistically similar to Mornin' and We're In This Love Together.

{"text":"When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, she has honestly been the most overconsumed artist of the past decade. Yet, when it has came down to her music, she has not really hit the strides she has shown in demand. Sadly, the quality of her voice has died in favor of quantity. Her self-titled record really has not had the peak of songs she could've made it out to be. That showed with Drunk In Love and XO. Her latest song Pretty Hurts, also follows in stride in weakness. It tries to be an anthem in regards to women about being yourself, and not trying to make yourself over in regards to attracting men over. Sadly, I didn't really find the song to be striking in her voice at all. I think the Queen B should stop and take more time to find her voice, and then she can hit the nail on the head. Pretty does hurt in voice.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3}

{"text":"\"Perfect Imperfection\" is the debut solo album by guitarist\/composer Tom Carleno, but this is hardly the beginning of his music career. Carleno has been performing with his acoustic jazz ensemble, Perpetual Motion, for more than twenty-five years and has recorded five albums with them. \"Perfect Imperfection\" is a real showcase for Carlenos varied and passionate style of acoustic guitar playing and composing. A retrospective of eleven songs composed over the past twenty-five years and recorded over a four-year period, the pieces range from the serene Meet Me in Maui to covers of Al Stewarts On the Border and John Lennons Imagine to Childs Play, a spirited duet for guitar and spoons, and Rhapsody in Blood, Carlenos homage to the horror films of the 1930s and 40s - complete with sound effects! A master of his instrument, Carleno tells stories without words and paints vivid pictures without a canvas, sharing experiences and having fun in the process.\n\nThe album begins with In Search Of, a piece that Carleno says seemed to be trying to find its own way as he was writing it, sometimes going in different directions than he expected. Easy-going and relaxed, its a great opening. Meet Me in Maui is in memory of Carlenos mother, who also loved to vacation in Maui. Very tranquil and calming, it feels like a warm breeze blowing over a peaceful ocean. Beautiful! On the Border is one of Al Stewarts classic signature pieces. Originally released in 1976, Carlenos cover version is a great tribute to the British rocker! The graceful Timberline Tree was inspired by a painting by Carlenos mother, Joan Hagen Carleno. The piece is gorgeous, and a copy of the painting graces the back of the CD cover. I love Childs Play, a  playful and lighthearted duet for guitar and spoons (performed by Carlenos wife, Josie Quick). Rhapsody in Blood is a trip! Inspired by the spooky soundtracks for early horror films, this 6 1\/2-minute tour de force includes some great sound effects, many (all???) of which were created on the guitar - creaking doors, howling wolves, bone-chilling screams, thunder, and other sounds of dark foreboding. From there, we go to the gentle simplicity of Lennons classic Imagine - an exceptionally nice arrangement! Brief Encounter was Carlenos first finger-style composition, written in 1985, and What a Difference a Day Makes is a lovely new piece composed specifically for this album.\n\n\"Perfect Imperfection\" is a wonderful album that is excellent for focused listening as well as in the background. Well, Rhapsody in Blood isn't too good as background music, but the rest of the tunes are! Great stuff!","classification":5}

Congrats, kudos, and bravo to the producer that created that, because it is simply amazing. Perfect for spy movies, and when it was used in \"Chuck,\" and it's just so darn catchy.
