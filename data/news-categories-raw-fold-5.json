And not only did the CIA mislead Congress, but its claims -- repeated this week -- about the program's effectiveness were also unsupported by the evidence. It was a small step in accounting for one of the most shameful episodes in U.S. history. But it's not enough to, as the president did, simply say we won't do it again. The larger question is: Why aren't the program's architects being prosecuted? The methods used, the president said, are \"inconsistent with our values as a nation.\" And so is placing some people above the law for political expediency. Thankfully, there is no statute of limitations on torture.","classification":"POLITICS","fold":5}

The theme was The Fourth Industrial Revolution -- the coming era of automation and smart technology -- and what business can do to help meet the big challenges ahead of us. The dominant refrain was the need for business leaders to put purpose at the center of the definition of business itself. It's a shift, already underway, with the power to not only improve the world but also boost the bottom line. As Unilever CEO Paul Polman put it, \"investing in the common good, investing in the long term, is a better investment than just your short-term self-interest.\" What came through loud and clear this year was a growing realization that companies that chase short-term profits at the expense of social responsibility won't last very long.

Perhaps if we allowed them to actually bring out tape measures they wouldn't have to establish their macho credentials through posturing promises of carpet bombing, deportation and torture. But the most extraordinary moment came at the end. After attacking Trump as a fraud and a danger to the country, when asked if they'd support him as nominee all three of the other candidates said, in effect, Yeah, sure, no problem.

Meanwhile, Jeb Bush said he disagreed with Trump, but made sure to get in on the xenophobia with the term \"anchor babies.\" It was a week that gave us two very different examples of statesmanship and what America can stand for.","classification":"POLITICS","fold":5}

{"text":"This week proved that while the arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice, it often takes a very circuitous route. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard arguments in King v. Burwell, the case challenging the Affordable Care Act. At stake is not only the future of Obamacare but also the frayed legitimacy of the Court itself. The unintentional joke of the day was offered by Justice Scalia, who, apparently without irony, suggested Congress would fix Obamacare if the court struck it down: \"You really think Congress is just going to sit there while all of these disastrous consequences ensue?\" Good one. Less funny was the Justice Department's scathing report that same day detailing egregious discrimination by the Ferguson police department and court system.  It certainly added sobering context to Saturday's marking of the 50th anniversary of Selma's \"Bloody Sunday\" march.

Before the victims' bodies were even identified, Donald Trump was trying to fear-bait and scapegoat, bragging that he'd somehow been proven right and doubling down on his plan to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. But Trump's disgusting attempt to capitalize on a national tragedy didn't work. According to a CBS poll, only 25 percent approved of his shameful response, while 51 percent disapproved, and nearly two-thirds rejected his Muslim ban. Meanwhile, several members of Congress walked out of the now-traditional post-massacre moment of silence, with Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) calling them \"an abomination\" that does not \"honor the victims\" but \"mocks them.\" Senate Democrats then took over the Senate for 15 hours demanding action on gun control. Whatever the outcome, it is heartening to know that the time of silence is finally over, and that voices for reform are being heard over racist, divisive dog-whistles.","classification":"POLITICS","fold":5}
