{"text":"This is nothing but a yelling contest.  With the exception of maybe one  or two selections, everything else sucks.  He doesn't sound like he's worked on anything, doesn't sound like he's actually singing for a musical; he just gathered some sheet music from musicals and caterwauled his way through it.  There is almost nothing of substance on this album... he's picked \"Over the Rainbow\"...big deal.  Third graders do that one.  He also chose \"Pure Imagination\" with absolutely no thought that his voice is not right for that song.  \"Pure Imagination\" is a gentle, warm song, not fit for the yelling and hollering that Groban seems to think Broadway songs are to be performed.  It's like he thinks every selection is \"Anthem\".  It's not.\nYou know, we get it.  He can sing.  He has a strong voice.  We don't need another album of vocal exercises to prove it.  He chose almost all of the wrong selections for the kind of power his voice has.  All in all, very disappointing both in Groban's attitude towards this album, his lack of thought towards the pieces he chose and his arrogance towards noise ordinances.  Save your money.  This one will be on Cheap Album of the Day soon.","classification":1,"fold":3}
{"text":"I am not surprised at the glowing reviews here. Most people who review Nicks' music loves her persona as much as, if not more than, her actual abilities. But I look at her music, not just as a fan, but try to listen more objectively. Good artists do not always put out good music.\n\nI like Nicks, though her recent work isn't what I would call stellar. She is more than a decent writer, but if she doesn't have the right producer, her material is banal. It's also not surprising that she, once again, visited old material (just as she did on her last record, and 'Shangri-La' and many on Fleetwood Mac's 'Say You Will' songs as well as their 'Extended Play).  She's been pulling stuff from 'the vaults' for at least a decade and a half  now. '24 Karat Gold' is not a new concept for her.\n\nHad she released the actual demos instead of redos, THAT would have been something worth listening to.\n\nNicks has a few things going against her with '24'. While her voice might be stronger than it was in the mid-80s, it is also very limited in range. Kids, this is what 3 packs a day will do to you (her admission, not mine). She has very few songs which are arranged with any kind of high note....and I'm not talking them being that high.\n\nThough with the right vocal arrangement, her material can work. She just doesn't have that here.\n\nThe other thing she is lacking is a balance of harmonies. She has been working with her two backing singers for 3+ decades and honestly, it worked initially, but that vocal combo is doing Nicks no favors. They are too similar to ever be considered 'harmony vocals'. Though harmony is exactly what Nicks needs to make her songs work.\n\n...and dare I say it...she needs male harmony vocals.\n\nLet's jump right to \"Twisted\". That song worked back in 1996 because of Lindsey Buckingham's production, arrangement  and yes, harmony vocals. (and let's forget that she released the demo on 'Enchanted' years back....so she's rehashing rehashed songs).\n\nI find the vocals on this record to be very monotone. It goes back to her range, or lack of one.  For the good rhythm of \"Mabel Normand\", the she rarely moves off of two or three notes, making each line sound like a run-on sentence. The new version of \"Cathouse Blues\" can't even hold a candle to a very stripped down demo.\n\nWhatever relationship\/issues Nicks has Buckingham on how he handles her music, in the long-run her artistry is better for it. '24 Karat Gold' won't be going into any kind of rotation for me. It had potential, but it seems to be squandered.","classification":1,"fold":3}

Unfortunately, Rihanna has been one of those singers who has been so severely overexposed that the quality of her own work has diminished greatly, that her work has not been worth listening too. Her latest set of songs with Kanye West and Paul McCartney on Four Fiver Seconds has been less than striking from the heart. She really has not found better for her own voice, from start to finish. Bitch Better Have My Money, or BBHMM has been one of her worst songs she has came out in a long while. I definitely found this song that not only be just annoying, it definitely ranked much lower from her work from before. I definitely think Rihanna really has let her own voice go.

{"text":"Diehards of Tropical Pop music can never get enough of a good thing.  That's why people will line up for miles to see Jimmy Buffet.  He's made a whole career out of \"Margaritaville,\" and any elaboration has brought the faithful, clad in Jamaican shorts and comfy shirts, to lean back, relax, and sit in the sun.  Everyone from Kenny Chesney ('No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem') and actor Matthew McConaughey hang out at the beach for their own benefit and for the fans who want to let it all hang loose.\n\nNow there are two ways to work this out:  One is to coast on one's laurels (which really does fits the bill) or reinvent the wheel at some point.\n\nJack Johnson, who admirably has personified Donovan's \"Mellow Yellow\" like none other in recent memory, brings perhaps his most varied and festive luau to date.  As one of the biggest selling singer-songwriters of the past decade, he's decided for the latter, adding electric guitar and piano accompaniment to refurbish his admirable penchant to strum out acoustical licks with sentiments of domestic bliss and utopian wishes without stressing out his laid-back Hawaiian surfer dude sensibilities.  While even the 'Curious George' soundtrack was to the point, endearing, and reached a destination lyrically, his former work seems sketchy in comparison to his latest C.D., 'To the Sea.'\n\nThe starter \"You and Your Heart,\" the title track, and \"From the Clouds\" bring it all back home admirably, but the acoustical \"My Little Girl,\" the intricate folk tune \"Turn Your Love,\" and the bluesy \"Red Wine, Mistakes, and Mythology\" give a more kaleidoscopic musical vision, preventing a rut for the Hawaii-in-the-hammock backdrop of his music.  For the latter, one can't help but think of the kind of accompaniment the Beatles had on \"Hey Bulldog,\" without any complaints of copyright infringement.  \"No Good with Faces\" and \"The Upsetter\" are familiar Johnson, but even these allegedly lesser tracks have a new flair with smooth harmonies (or a double-tracked voice) and smoother licks and new instruments.  (Is that a harmonica I hear on \"No Good with Faces\" and \"At or with Me\"?)\n\nPerhaps even more than 'In Between Dreams,' Jack has found the right groove and given all casual and faithful fans a reason to tune in once again.  'To the Sea' realizes these promises and shuffles the musical deck of Johnson's already rewarding music catalog.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"The heavily-promoted and massive Time-Life \"mail order only\" series of Your Hit Parade CDs of about 18-23 years ago constantly reminded you on TV that \"you can't get these in any store\" and seemed intent, at the time, to corner the market on everything from the Big Band Era to Pop, Country, R&B, Soul and R&R. In addition to some single artist releases, they also put out year by year volumes covering the best hits beginning with 1940, interspersed with theme releases such as Golden Goofers (novelty tunes of the period) and the one covered here which provides more tongue-in-cheek tunes of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nSince there was little real competition in terms of sound quality and program notes at the time, I suppose quite a few bought into the hype, although it was quite an expensive venture since they also charged considerably more for each disc than the normal going rate and, at times, repeated sides which you noticed if you happened to have an ongoing subscription arrangement. Now here we are with options like Ace\/Kent, Acrobat, Jasmine, Bear Family, Rhino, Varse-Sarabande, Razor & Tie, etc., and suddenly these Time-Life releases are popping up for sale used all over the place, and often at prices considerably less than when they were first issued.\n\nEven so, many in the series still contain the odd side that today is not easy to find in a quality CD setting and seldom (if ever) with better sound reproduction and informative liner notes.

If you must categorize maybe think of this, after Sturgill's last album all of the critics, bloggers, writers, and late night talk show hosts claimed that he was the savior of country music (wait wasn't that Jamey Johnson the year before, and now is not Chris Stapelton?). That is a huge weight to carry on ones shoulders. I love that Sturgill came out and did what he wanted to do. I love the horns, I love the guitar (he may be the best guitarist in country music, go watch some Sunday Valley videos, he will blow your mind), I love the story. This album even has a Nintendo 64 Goldeneye reference, I spent more than one night in a smoked filled room with buddies playing that game. Way to go Sturgill, keep on doing what you wanna do.

I really dig the new line up ( except Dave Ellison) with Chris Adler from Lamb Of God and the new guitar player Kiko Lourerio. Really adds a heavier and edge to the album. I wouldn't say Dave and co went for a throwback to the thrash days, but the thrash is back in the music in a big way but adding more of a modern metal sound and production to their music sort of giving the music a fresh kinda feeling that I think megadeth needed. The classic megadeth riffing is there sort of reminding me of the peace sells days mixed with some rust in peace with a more modern sound. Even at times the riffing reminds me a little of Pantera. The new guitar player really adds some new and fresh ideas to the table of certain songs like the instrumental conquer or die adding sort of a Spanish acoustic intro before exploding into a metal epic that seems sort of out of place for megadeth but a pleasant surprise. For old school fans check out thrashers like the threat is real ( the first track) and fatal illusion are some of my favorites so far. This album will differently me getting more spins on my iPod and in my car. Great comeback metal album a lot heavier than super collider if you hated collider.

{"text":"It's hard to judge this album for what it is, which is a good, solid hard rock album - as opposed to what it's not, which would be a classic Dio heavy metal album. It's pretty good... that's really the best (and worst) I could say. Andrew Freeman has a good voice and has written some decent lyrics here - nothing cringeworthy.... BUT he isn't RJD.... and to his credit he doesn't try to be. Here's the thing Vivian Campbell has said -  that band members are not just interchangeable - that no matter how good a player is that they bring a uniqueness which is integral to band chemistry... and in that respect this makes me miss RJD more than ever because if he were in the mix this would have been so much more than just good or pretty good... in all likelihood it would have been great. This isn't a \"great\" album but it's definitely good and is definitely a quality album... just not magic. All the players do a good job and this is much better than so much of the crap that's out there... but if you are hungry for heaven and looking for Holy Diver or the Last In Line (the albums) you aren't going to get that here. I think it's a tad misleading to say this would fit in with those two albums... there are singers that could have \"filled in\" for Dio (Halford, Dickinson etc.) but a virtual unknown is always going to suffer by comparison, especially when his pedigree is Lynch Mob  and the Vegas lounge act Raiding the Rock Vault. Not disparaging him  - kudos to the guy for making a living as a rock singer in 2016 but this is not someone coming out of Rainbow and Sabbath at the height of his popularity... and this is not about his voice or his range, it's simply that he doesn't have the pedigree or the gravitas that RJD had and when you pull a star like that out of a lineup it can lead to a black hole. this isn't that bad of a situation but, again, doesn't capture the magic... if you are looking for the closest thing to those first two Dio albums pick up Dio's vastly under-appreciated Killing the Dragon which was the last Dio album to feature the late, great Jimmy Bain. If you are looking for relatively kick ass hard rock you could do worse than this. Definitely give it a shot just set your expectations accordingly....I also feel that the original Dio keyboard player is missed and that while this is VCs most guitar driven project since Dio his playing and writing here doesn't quite hit the high water mark of those first two Dio albums.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Amy Winehouse appeared at the Brecon Jazz festival a few years ago and sadly although I was there that year, I missed the chance to see her live. With this new album she moves the goalposts from Jazz to Soul and what a triumph it is.\n\nIf you like Motown or 60's soul with an occasional hint of doo-wop you are going to love this. Brassy (literally - Sax, Trumpet etc) sometimes funky, with Amy's expressive vocals singing her own earthy lyrics this is a classic album and undoubtably the best I have heard this year, regardless of style. The single 'Rehab' and 'Me & Mr Jones' are the stand-out tracks for me.\n\nAs previous reviewers have noted it is short (35 mins) so I have docked it a star, but there is no filler on this album and I recommend it strongly.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Mmm, mmm, mmm. Bloc Party. I don't know. \"Four\" is different all right, but different in a good way? A great way? I don't think so. After listening to it repeatedly all week, and, of course, listening to their other three albums plus Kele's solo works, all I can say is they have an uneven album here. There are 14 tracks (plus one extra if you downloaded \"Lean\" like I did) and it just feels too long, and frankly, uninteresting. I'm not sure where the blame falls here, but this isn't a band on the rise, it is a band on the slide.\n\nI wonder whose idea it was to go full rock and roll here with the likes of \"Kettling\", \"Coliseum\" and \"We're Not Good People\"? And the ballads are slightly off here with \"Day Four\" and \"The Healing\". So that leaves some oddly dull numbers like \"So He Begins To Lie\", \"3x3\" and \"Team A\". If you agree with my assessment of all those tracks, then there's no way you can give \"Four\" five or four stars--just no way.\n\nI suppose I liked \"Octopus\", \"Real Talk\", \"V.A.L.I.S.\", \"Truth\" and the extra tracks \"Mean\" and \"Leaf Skeleton\". And to be honest, I liked \"Day Four\". So what's that? Seven tracks? Technically I should give \"Four\" two and a half stars, but because it's Bloc Party, I give it three stars. Slightly above average.\n\nYou have to admit that \"Silent Alarm\" and \"A Weekend In The City\" were much better. Even \"Intimacy\" is slightly better than \"Four\". And maybe I'm the only one who felt that Kele's solo work was really good on \"The Boxer\" and \"The Hunter EP\". In fact, and I know I will be crucified for saying this, I felt that Kele is better off without Bloc Party. His solo work showed such great adventure, and to have to come back to the confines of Bloc Party.....well, perhaps the band should call it a day because I don't see where they are going to go from here. They seem to have hit a dead end, musically, and they seem to be out of ideas here.\n\nI'm all for a band growing and changing, but it has to be interesting, and that is seriously lacking here on \"Four\".\n\nIt's sad, actually, because the band showed great promise with \"Silent Alarm\" and then they have systematically deconstructed themselves, imploding under the pressure to keep up the pace and originality first heard on \"Silent Alarm\". I believe I read somewhere where some of the band members said that \"Four\" was not going to be like their earlier work, and that they can not go back to that place now, but \"Four\" lacks any sort of cohesive musical vision. I mean, if you're going to make a change, either go entirely and fail, or don't go at all. \"Four\" is some tentative, uncertain step--like the band sound unsure of how to proceed musically.\n\nIf Bloc Party broke up at this point I guess I wouldn't be disappointed. In fact, I'd be interested to see what Kele would do next, and really, the rest of the band could go on to other projects.\n\nSo, \"Four\" gets three stars. Here's how it compares with the band's other works and Kele's solo outings:\n\n2005 Silent Alarm: Five Stars\n2007 A Weekend In The City: Five Stars\n2008 Intimacy: Four Stars\n2010 The Boxer (Kele solo): Four Stars\n2011 The Hunter EP (Kele Solo): Four Stars\n2012 Four: Three Stars","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"Usually Adele does just fine with her music.  Even if it's a song that you don't particularly gravitate towards, you can acknowledge that it is a well-crafted song.  Unfortunately, her song \"Send My Love\" is not one of those songs.  It is the prime example of all that is wrong with her latest album \"25\".  The entire album is lyrically and musically lazy.  It tries to coast on the strength of Adele's stellar voice.  It offers nothing else (certainly not the way \"19\" and \"21\" provided sharp song-writing and musical arrangements)\n\n  \"Send My Love\" has several things working against it.  First, it is part of the mediocre \"25\".  Second, it has been so badly overplayed on commercial radio (well beyond how much \"Hello\" was played) that even the song's biggest fans or totally sick of it.  Finally, it is just an irritating song.  It has been described a peppier version of Adele's 'bashing her ex' songs.  At this point (3 albums worth), Adele repeatedly bashing her ex in song has gotten quite tiresome.  Make one of those songs with a more energetic musical sound is just obnoxious.","classification":1,"fold":3}

{"text":"Like many, I was introduced to Imagine Dragons by their hit \"Radioactive,\" which proved popular enough that it was not only included on the soundtrack to the movie \"The Host,\" but was covered by Pentatonix and parodied by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic.  At first I thought it would be a case of \"I just like one song by this group,\" but when I listened to their song \"Warriors,\" I knew I would like this band.  I'm normally not a fan of modern rock, but Imagine Dragons is quickly proving to be the exception, and their album \"Night Visions\" has really grown on me.\n\nOf the songs on this album, \"Radioactive\" and \"On Top of the World\" would have to be my favorite songs.  The former is a thunderous and raw song, but strangely hopeful despite the dystopian, post-apocalyptic theme of it.  \"On Top of the World\" is quite different, a livelier and upbeat number that wouldn't be out of place in a Dreamworks movie.  Both songs have hooked me, and evoke very different but still powerful emotions every time I listen to them.\n\nOther favorites on this album include the pop-flavored \"Tip Toe,\" the powerful \"Demons,\" and the more subdued but still thoughtful and pleasant \"Amsterdam.\"  Other songs, such as \"Underdog\" and \"Bleeding Out,\" aren't necessarily bad, they just weren't my favorites of the album.  Still, overall this album has far more hits than misses for me.  Imagine Dragons has a powerful sound to it that can be raw, melancholy, upbeat, or mellow as they see fit, and they've certainly proven to be a great band with this album.\n\nIf you like bands such as Linkin Park or Dashboard Confessional, you'll probably enjoy \"Night Visions.\"  Give it a shot.  This band is going far if they keep up this sound quality.","classification":4,"fold":3}

But it is the holiday season when taking out this cd just makes all the great memories rush back and luckily I have those with me who love to share it and together we can make new memories.\n\nGranted it was only Shirley Jones and David Cassidy who really sang.  The rest were studio musicians and singers.  But call it bubble gum or pop, the chemistry worked.  This Christmas cd is pure hearfelt performances that bring the pleasures the holidays should.  From the original peppy opening MY CHRISTMAS CARD TO YOU and other feel good tracks like SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN, JINGLE BELLS, ROCKIN ROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE and SLEIGH RIDE to the slower WHITE CHRISTMAS, BLUE CHRISTMAS and HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS we get the perfect blend of David Cassidy's always great and reliable vocals mixed with the great Partridge sound.  There is no sound in music like the backup voices on a Partridge song and it is great fun.  And of course Shirley Jones get her solo turn on THE CHRISTMAS SONG.\n\nIf you grew up with the Partridges and their music you owe it to yourself to add this cd to your music collection.  It will bring such fun and joy to these special holidays.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"When most rappers emerge in the rap game, they do so with a level of urgency. That exigency is the foundation of hip-hop as well as the nature of life in the 'hood which propels this genre of music. After a couple of albums and artist success, most rappers tend to relax, which often affects their music. It's understandable that Ortiz would reach a point where he needs to catch his breath, hence the title and tone of this album. After all, he's been rapping like his life depends on it ever since he emerged in the game. Add that to the fact that he's made lifestyle changes (refraining from alcohol and cigarettes, working-out, weight loss), it's understandable that his music will reflect upon his personal growth. This release includes a few R&B tracks previously non-existent within his catalogue, not to mention some jazz influenced production. However, these tracks are a mixed bag of weak to solid. The Joell Ortiz that I dig is the cat who rips mics with supreme lyricism. Although he's lyrically sharp throughout this project, the initial missteps on the disc (\"Cold World\" \"Dream On\" \"Brothers Keeper\") are disruptive head scratchers. Unlike his previous two albums which were \"press and play\" from front to finish, this album may have many listeners hitting next from time to time. This is a good album, but not the great album that you would expect from a great artist. 3.5\/5","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"This would turn out to be an unusual review for me to do, I would really have to search my soul to feel this album around me and allow it to touch me in the same way as they events that have conspired over the years to touch musician Isadar to bring forth a real hard hitting, emotional roller coaster of the release RED.\nRed is a true bittersweet relationship tester, Broken Valentine I almost felt was not only dark but also chaotic. Isadar as a unique quality to enable him to almost read you a story through his style of playing, you are literally travelling through the heart and mind with the musician and in Broken Valentine, through the journey perhaps of a dysfunctional relationship.\nThe title track is placed at two and Red seems to once more take you through this ever changing and emotive journey of love good or bad, its a piece that I found almost representative of being able to watch your life and love back in the wonderful luxury of hindsight and smart at the bad decisions and smile at the fond memories, love is indeed red and as close to anger in emotions as indeed is the colour.\nThe man who broke my heart was written about Isadars relationship problems with his father, as a listener and reviewer I found this piece almost cried out to me at such a deep level and you could almost hear the child crying alone in a dark corner of his bedroom with that helpless feeling of dejection and let down hanging over your head, this is a deeply felt composition, but where we see the music being the healer.\nThe Stairwell I can honestly say is the track I felt the most moved by, the beginning of this track could easily be a soundtrack for a blockbusting suspense movie, it has that emotive quality about it and indeed while listening to this piece and the next one I was almost moved to tears myself.\nWho could have imagined what occurred in or on the stairwell and the caressing of the keys by Isadar on this piece almost imprints memories into the very walls of this place, from the stairwell and almost towards the end of this piece I could sense a light starting to appear from the darkness, perhaps a chink of brightness from a distant window close to the Stairwell?\nLetting Go I found a difficult track personally for me, as one who has just come out of a thirty eight year relationship it is always hard to let go, especially of those like my late wife who has passed over. Part of the healing process is to eventually let go, but not just of the physical relationship but of all the regrets and guilt. Here this track really hits the nail right on the head, it deals with the very essence of the letting go process, it reflects the turbulence of emotions that seems to echo in the hard playing within this piece, as Isadar plays forcefully you can almost hear him working through this very process and of course the end result is what we should always have freedom, this piece is the perfect musical representation of the letting go process, as Isadar says about the album, its bittersweet.\nEn Face Du Miroir (Facing The mirror) This a composition of hope and renewal, but most of all courage, here Isadars style seems to be more reflective on his journey, the feeling from the chords and structure is almost like a person has come through a great time of struggle and at this point is literally looking down into his own soul for a time of reflection, the journey seems to be endless and the style here seems to reflect that and in the moment when love and hate collide there is always our passion that will set us free.\nBlood Thicker Than Water, this is the ultimate track to end such an album with, from the journey of love and emotions, here Isadar stars with a dark reflective style, but that soon changes to a more upbeat conflict and resolution feel, we can truly sense here that some sort of reconciliation has been found and from that the melody it gives us a brilliant ending to the project, we can also truly feel that here now is a person who has really found his place in life and is now finding the support he always truly wanted.  This was actually my favourite track from the album.\nRed is a very powerful concept, its a rare album that actually does address the bittersweet emotions of love and hate as they crash together on the rocks of life, simply put if you are serious about your music and are very particular of what you play, then you really need to get a cop of RED by ISADAR.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Trent Reznor has laid the groundwork for music distribution. Trent Reznor is God. Well, maybe he had lots of help and a few Talking Heads fans to back him up, but he has done it, RIGHT! Fork over 5 dollars on the NIN site and you get 320kb download with a large free collection of above average landscape photography, PDF, and the whole thing is carried off but with hardly any pretense minus that of being a premier musician and all around artist trying to expand their box, a prison that Trent Reznor has finally busted I might add. NIN have taken things to a new level that has actually set precedent for the paradigm. And to boot, if you want bigger and better CD\/Vinyl sets he says 10 dollars to 300 dollars, depending how rabid you are over his sexual presence on this earth, of course with various trinkets and the obligatory signature signed with His own blood.\n\nGhosts 19 I stole because it TOTALLY sounded like superior Skinny Puppy 1990. You figure the terrible ninties. GET that. HAHA. NiNties. Uh........ Ghosts 6 I come back to because it reminds me of the good ol' days with SAW Vol. 2. How it so could fit on there, perfectly, and yet it sounds as if TRez had these sound in him his whole life, which, he has, only he was forced into making texture pop with voice, (damn that voice) decrepit and decayed as his pop may be. 31 Ghosts is amazing for the wailing banshee guitar, courtesy of Adrian Belew?, and it is welcome that one of my favorite King Crimson guitarists is given more due NIN time than usual, as he appears on many tracks. Reverse that and 13 is a beautiful piano driven peace ode to death, breathing courtesy of Trent? What a great track, though, I really dig the Fragile leftover Ghosts 34: a compliment that was, because the sound is reminiscent of certain tracks that were Tony Tiger GREAT back in 1999, I even hear them using some of the same equipment I think. Ghosts 28 is tonal and tribal, a stark representation of landscape maybe, gently rolling along the hills, the sound invading every crack and crevice, raw and harsh.\n\nAnother track I truly enjoyed was Ghosts 24 from III that does what Prodigy should have been doing after Fat of the Land NO ******* kidding. Ghosts 5, to take a stark detour, is mostly Sergio Leone leftover depression.... Oh.... yeah... most people don't have this type of depression.... 21 is like a mishmash of Into the Void and every trick Trent has learned from two decades of experience in layering his music.\n\nAll the material is excellent, in my opinion, and if you are familiar with Still, than you know where this collection is going, just above and beyond the pretty and sombre lamentations found there.\n\nGhosts I-IV looks very promising, and the entire package is worth any music lover's time, and that it will for all this to sink in. Just Being a NIN fan of The Fragile and TDS in particular, this new work is complex as those and even more stunning in many other respects, just as Still was a nice complement to And All That.... Ghosts is the complementary side of Year Zero, evoking everything from Debussy's La Mer to Autechre's Confield to Aphex Twin Druqks; even the buzz saw guitars and streaming bass lines of punk and new wave era Cure come through with ZING on Ghosts 4. I honestly don't know what to say about the preceding track because it alone is worth the price of admission to download this whole album. Ghosts 3 is amazing. Very Richard like but then again it is wholly the creation of Trent. I love the sickly tangy guitar instrument at 2:00, with the overlaying distortions, voices, synths, etc. and of course the bassline! Can't forget that NIN bass line, morphing into guitar, swooning around beats and loops and Lalalalalal yeah the point is that many of the tracks are evocative mind trips that serve headphones, amps, and darkness well.\n\nTDS is almost universally admired if not for songwriting then production and arrangement. The Fragile was a masterpiece in its own space and mind, forging ahead the new digital era with samples and tracks galore, incisors bared solemnly with nary a hint of hope to be redeemed; Left disc ended on The Great Below, one of the most poignant and interesting odes to love and death that NIN has ever written. THAT was followed by something we previously hadn't heard from NIN. The Right disc was amazing and fresh, including a rap, a shoutout, and complex instrumentals that further divided NIN from the LAME industrial landscape. The gigantic transducer eating beats surely convinced the bassheads of the blatant talent, too.\n\nI began to get the feeling that The Fragile was something special, broken and marred, but put together and soothing in the way that suffering, knowing suffering, leads eventually to change, slow as it might happen.\n\nSo after that whole experience in my late teens, five years later With Teeth was slightly disappointing, and a bit weak in the lyrical department. I kept wanting to hear the vicious instrumentals from before, or even unsubtle rage of Somewhat Damaged; instead, it was all chorus and pomp, and the raw emotion was definitely missing, though, some songs were inevitably quite provoking. Year Zero was definitely the Rockstar side revived, I enjoyed it because of the abrasive beats and the creativity of the song lyrics; the choruses seemed more appropriate and less in your face and that helps when you tire of a songs pop structure with repeated listening.\n\nBut this, this record I do not hold, Ghosts I-IV, is the Miles Davis spectre of an unconventional time working through world wide conflicts that affect individuals, as we may reflect in our art as the Jazz Master did with his bands for decades: the poets, painters, directors, etc. all do this is different ways. We who love to learn and share want something better than what currently is, and we are working on all levels to adjust our realities to what is happening, the tragedies that we know should not be taking place in our human world, the idea that things changed on an invisible level lead to change beyond, and if that thin line of inspiration comes from these little pieces of plastic and paper then YAY, the world is getting better right?\n\nAre you full of BULLSH**, crank? Are all artists full of this stuff you call Bullsh**?\n\nWell, I don't know, but the record is supremely satisfying; an aura exudes from this album that is the perfect representation of NIN's instrumental vision. They are pioneering not quite radical but comprehensive postmodern sound. Good things can only come from this, along with other artist's to follow, even novelist's and poet's should take notice, the internet is the Argus, you are a part of us, taking this music industry beyond what it is now, taking the entertainment industry and edging one notch for the artist alone, as  a man or woman, only 400 more blows till we kill the uncouth blubbery PIG that never wanted to share its profits.\n\nI, Disciple 16, rarely buy in stores anymore; actually I don't at all, though, BMG online has enabled me to collect dozens of double sets, remasters that I could not get any other way. I don't think, if you look hard enough, the industry is dead, it was just waiting for the intro to a new AGE. As a consumer, you had to be wary, and if you weren't, BubblePop METAL would and will be sold to you with dumptrucks, peddled on the radio because you haven't the time to choose.\n\nOh well whatever nevermind crank get on with it OKAY this isn't going to change everything, but at this stage corporate rock has killed the radio and we all know it. Radio aversely affects what is popular and 'they' want to sell us everything we don't need to hear, nothing daring, all angst and facades, veils of illusion. This distribution model shows us that ART carried off with great taste can survive by the consumer alone. The late 60's period this is not. We have to start choosing what we want, and now we have a line that has been crossed, successfully.\n\nSo beyond the advertisement for this album, Ghosts exists in the senses that imply change, reflection, and the will to follow through these harsh times. I can recall instrumentals like Just Like You Imagined, Complication, and A Warm Place that changed my mind on who Trent was becoming. Indeed, like the reformation of classical music in the 1900's, but fully modernized with an even larger palette, this album tries to do what pioneering artists like Schoenberg, Cage, and Eno were doing then, not aversely changing everything, but doing things in slightly esoteric ways. After the press reviews and eventual release, people will start changing their minds about NIN again. And that is because all great artists are dynamic, and those who pigeon hole people like Trent deserve to get that slap in the face, though, they can still hate and fill their life with super indie SH**, this is the record that set the benchmark. I feel that the music is alive in the artist here, and very well recorded, mixed, and mastered. There is no way a site like Pitchfork should be giving this anything below a 9, and we shall see about that soon......... and we have a 5.0!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYes! the reviewer is obviously a syntactical genius who obviously knows NIN by heart, just read the review folkie, there need be NO CONvincing.\n\nI fully award this work five stars for the 1 free side alone. Terrific setup and expert presentation for all the various packages laid out perfectly on NIN's website. A great surprise. A better foundation.\n\nP.S. I will now actually go listen to the album. Trent, Trent, can I leave now? (weeping)","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Recorded at a couple of pit stops in Germany, the Netherlands, Glasgow Scotland, Paris, Oslo, Stockholm, Denmark, Ireland, and six different English cities (Birmingham, Nottingham, Manchester, Newcastle, London, and Donington), the first live release from NOLA-based sludge\/doom metal supergroup Down is spread out over the course of sixteen tracks and two separate discs. It is a weighty metal feast, that is for sure, but also one extremely satisfying and enjoyable one, and one that is overflowing with the good stuff: Great riffs, solos, and frontman Phil Anselmo's household wail. And 2010's \"Diary Of A Mad Band\" is also sparked with an excellent, palpable, and inescapable live energy, though each and every one of these songs is also flawlessly performed.\n\nTracks like the opening \"Losing All\" are fat with big, beefy, grinding riffage and wailing vocals, but are also peppered with a good batch of unorthodoxly ripping guitar soloing. This number is also of note for featuring quite a bit of crowd interaction, because it is one where Phil lets the concert-goers sing its chorus. \"Lifer\" goes out to \"Dimebag Darrell,\" and very appropriately so, too, because it is an up-tempo, deeply grooving riff-fest with plenty of noteworthy, wah-tinged lead\/solo work to go along with its brutal guitar licks and cool, shrieking vocals. And later cuts like \"Rehab,\" which begins with the sound of Phil informing the crowd that he's taping the show, is very similar to \"Lifer,\" except that it has crashing cymbal rides in place of vocal shrieks.\n\nNearing the mid-section, Phil begins the next song, \"Temptations Wings\" by saying \"not to be effing generic or anything, but are you having a good time?!\" And really, it is almost impossible not to have one once you have heard this tune's serrated, grinding riffs, and the Down frontman's glorious, household wailing\/screaming. Track six, \"Ghosts Along The Mississippi,\" might begin with an unnecessarily long intro, but once it dissolves into a white-hot ball of buzzsaw riffing and ripping soloing, it becomes very clear that it is another big standout. \"Learn From This Mistake\" is a slow-burning, low-key, and very brooding doom metal dirge peppered with some wailing, and totally air-guitar-able leads and solos, thus making it another standout; and \"Hail The Leaf,\" which is stuffed to the gills with chunky, chugging guitar licks, is another. (Although the latter of these two tunes is actually mostly of note for being a song that Down had not played live in a long time, and actually not even once overseas.)\n\nMoving along, the first disc closes with one of its biggest highlights in \"New Orleans Is A Dying Ho,\" which again overflows with pounding doom riffs, whammy-bar-inflected leads, and fiery, inspiring solos. But this track is also of note for featuring quite a bit of crowd-involvement, as Phil leaves plenty of room in it for the crowd to sing part of the song's chorus.\n\nThe second disc opens on a misleading note, with \"Lies, I Don't Know What They Say, But...\" being backed by an ominous, bass-driven plod. But immediately following it, we are introduced to the big, fat, chugging riffage, grinding rhythms, pounding skins of the brutal bruiser that ensues in \"Underneath Everything.\" A noteworthy solo also comes ripping through, here, too. Then, Anselmo tells the audience that he demands to \"see this place go berserk,\" an easy task, too, when considering this up-tempo fist pumper features lots of excellent riffs and solos.\n\nOther highlights of the second disc include the really jazzy and bluesy \"Eyes Of The south\" (which \"goes out to a brother of ours: Mike Williams of Eyehategod\") that is immediately offset by an ensuing brutal, and booming riff-fest in \"Stone The Crows\"; and the set closer, \"Bury Me In Smoke.\" This one begins on a mildly comical note, as it is introduced with the joke that it is a Green Day cover. And \"Bury Me...\" is also of note because it, too, just oozes with amazing, serrated sludge\/doom metal riffing.\n\n\"Diary Of A Mad Band\" serves as a great companion release to Down's excellent 2007 release, \"Over The Under,\" and a satisfying snack for you to listen to while the band is on one of its inexplicably extensive hiatuses. So even though it cannot be said to be a mandatory purchase, it is a worthwhile one for all hardcore fans of the band.","classification":4,"fold":3}

She has really shown no such diversity in her voice to really be for all artists. Her latest single Pound The Alarm from her album Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded is really bad. She really hasn't changed her sound and flexed her vocal muscles in song. It feels like the exact same \"I have to prove that I am the best\" sound that she came out with before. I think the song is definitely one of the worst songs that has ever been released this year. Hopefully, Nicki will start growing up and then make better music.

{"text":"This is a mammoth set of the complete organ works of Johann Sebastian Bach, (or at least all that was known to have been written by Bach at the time) played by the late Walter Kraft, who tragically died in a hotel fire back in 1977. This set is really good technically, but decent in sound quality, having been recorded back in the 50's and 60's. E. Power Biggs, Friederich Walcha, Simon Preston and others have made better Bach organ music recordings, which are all out there of course. Often those are quite expensive. However, you get the whole motherlode here for only about ten dollars! So, price wise, you can't go wrong if you are a Bachaphile. Let's just say I give it 3 stars for recording quality and performance quality, and 5 stars for all of that great music at an inexpensive price. So that rounds out to 4 stars. Just like the Vox Box set of the complete keyboard works, played by Martin Galling on harpsichord, Vox tends to get all of this stuff out at a pretty good price. And they have done it here too-----------PEACE\nBTW-Be careful. This set contains over 15 hours of music, so it might overload your cloud.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"When it has came down t ballads from the 90's, there were very few and far between divas that really had the brilliance, beauty and simplicity to make songs written for them into masterpieces. Whitney Houston was the definitive example of a songstress who had dominated from start to end with great songs, and following in suite with ballads was Celine Dion. Still today, nothing has ever compared to her innocence and simplicity that still stands taller than almost all the rest in good songs. While everyone was so embodied with her song from Titanic, she had other songs that had also worked very nicely from her Let's Talk About Love album. The Bee Gees had one of them straight into her heart with Immortality. The song is a beautiful work of art that showcases to Celine, what Barbara Streisand had with Barry Gib on Guilty over a decade earlier. It is a beautiful song, and just a great song to listen t for any die hard Celine Dion fan, or for anyone hwo is new to her music for a time for when she had it all in her work.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Slow Train Coming-Bob Dylan ****\n\nWho saw it coming certainly not me. Bob Dylan a born and raised Jewish man who his entire career had songs dealing with his faith suddenly converted to Christianity. In 1978 Bob Dylan officialy converted to the Christian faith and has been devout ever since. In the process of embracing Jesus Christ as his lord and saviour he managed to write an entire album about it and a hit one at that. Slow Train coming would be the last hit Bob Dylan album for almost thirty years and it would also give him his last hit single of his career. Who knew that singing about the most contraversial subject ever could be turned into a massive success, only Dylan could make it happen.\n\nAfter Slow Train Coming Dylan would go into a finger pointing faze preeching instead of spreading the word of his lord, but doing so with the threat of hellfire and brimstone and consequently losing a lot of his fan base in the process not that he cared. Slow Train Coming was a rare album and a rare moment in the history of Bob Dylan because we never saw him this happy, voulnerable, or inspired again in his career\n\nWith the exception of 'When You Gonna Wake Up' the album is mostly happy and up beat in praise and very possitive. The song 'When You Gonna Wake Up' was a sign of things to come in a negative way, becaus earound the corner was nothing but judgement from Dylan. Really it was nothing but albums of judgement. But being as this record was recorded with legendary hardcore Jewish producer Jerry Wexler (Ray Charles, Motown), I don't think the man would have stood for finger pointing. 'Gotta Serve Somebody' became Dylans last hit single of the 1970's as well as his last hit single of his career. It's got a very loose feel and is full of Jamacan influence and lots of heavy organ, it is easy to see why this became such a big hit. Throughout the album someone other then Bob Dylans musical abilities shine, and that is of Mark Knopfler of Dire Straights, yes the legandary axe slinger plays through out the album and is an asset to the team on tracks like 'Precious Angel' and 'Slow Train.' The former is amazing and would have fit well on Dire Straights debut. The later 'Slow Train' is quite simply one of the best songs that Bob Dylan has ever recorded in his life period.\n\nDylans lyrics have always been known for beig nothing short of brilliant, but on this album they seem and feel more inspired then usuall. That may be do to his new found faith. The imagery dipicted in his words are amazing and you feel like your there whitnessing Dylan speak to his lord right in front of you. 'Man Gave Names To All The Animals' does seem like nothing more then a childhood neursery rhyme but it does at nice texture to the album and lighten the mood a little as it is a nod to Noah and his ark.\n\nSlow Train Coming is a must have for all fans of Dlyans work. It is his last essentail album for almost thirty years. After this Dylans albums were all hit or miss and even the decent ones are not essential and sound very dated. It wasn't until the late 1990's that Dylan did anything worth while. Since then he has released three albums that are among his best, Time Out Of Mind, Love And Theft, and Modern Times. Make Slow Train Coming apart of your Dylan collection.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"For their second album, OneRepublic mastermind Ryan Tedder must have woken up and decided if a lot of production was terrific, than over-production would be fabulous. As a songwriter to the stars (he counts Adele and Beyonce for resume points), he certainly knows his way around songwriting and hooks. But for a writer with so many soul and R'n'B artists on his Rolodex, when it comes to his own material, Tedder aims squarely at the rafters of the world's arenas, with a jealous eye towards the likes of Muse.\n\nTake \"All The Right Moves.\" The first song on the disc may be \"Made For You,\" but that song ends with a children's choir that sings the \"All The Right Moves\" anthemic chorus just before the bombastic percussion for the song itself bursts in. Strings swell as Tedder arcs his voice for a final soaring falsetto on the chorus' catchy hook. same with \"Secrets,\" where Tedder takes a page from his mentor Timbaland and mixes rap verses with a high flying chorus and more strings. Or the closer, \"Lullaby.\" Every bit as sedate as the title suggests, it's also twice as earnest as it probably needs to be. \"Waking Up\" contains bombast, but it's a good kind of bombast.\n\nProblem is, after awhile, you wish he'd just pull in the reins a little. The title track is such an obvious U2 clone that you wonder if Tedder stole it from an early draft of \"Spiderman: Turn Off The Dark.\" The militaristic drumming of \"Marching On\" is overkill, even if the left, left, left right left hook is unshakable. The hooks throughout \"Waking Up\" are the calling card; they show exactly why Tedder has become such a go-to guy for the stars. Even my favorite song here, \"Everybody Loves Me,\" strikes the perfect balance of snappy beats and earworm. Maroon 5 or Justin Timberlake would probably kill to get their teeth into it.\n\nUnfortunately, and why this album ultimately gets an average rating from me, I don't hear an identity on \"Waking Up.\" If Ryan Tedder wants to jump ahead of the likes of The Fray and become the equal to Maroon 5's Adam Levine (or genre champ Chris Martin of Coldplay), he's going to have to prove he's got more in him than ace writing chops. OneRepublic has the ambition, Tedder obviously knows both the writing and production craft, now it's to be determined if he can become in individual above the skill sets.","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"Ayo Technology by 50 Cent  feat. Justin Timberlake  is an electronic\/hip hop song that appears to be about a person basically saying that they want to meet their romantic interest in person rather than just electronically (just a guess from the lyrics). Timbaland makes an appearance in this song as well. Ayo Technology by 50 Cent feat. Justin Timberlake is perfect for eclectic music listeners and\/or those who are familiar with the song Carryout by Justin Timberlake and Timbaland (because Ayo Technology is in the same musical vein as Carryout).

{"text":"Ever since her win on X-Factor, Leona Lewis has had a pattern of becoming the biggest thing in Britain, before us Yanks come to our musical scenes, and say, 'Hey, this girl is pretty darn good!' So it's not surprising to me that people are only now starting to discover Leona's cover of Snow Patrol's mellow rock epic \"Run.\" Apparently after Lewis performed the cover on Radio 1's underrated Live Lounge, the people clearly loved it, with some people reporting the song bringing them to tears. And I can see why, as not only is it perfectly suited for her, but it showcases all of her talent and vocal chops.\n\nLeona uses every ounce of the song to it's ballad potential, with cliched choirs lighting up the chorus, bringing the song to an inspirational crescendo. Rest assured, if released in the 90s, it would be the best selling song in the freakin' world.\n\nHowever, some of the emotion is lost in this studio version, along with the rawness of the performance in the Live Lounge version. So, I wouldn't be surprised if it was picked up on radio, and became a big hit in the states, but given the choice of the studio and Live Lounge version, I'd scour the Internet for the original.\n\nLive Lounge Version: 5 Stars\nStudio Version: 4 Stars\nReal Score: 4.5","classification":5,"fold":3}

Gloria, Midnight hour, old Stones favorites -- these were the elements of our playlists.  The three-chord simplicity of these old tunes seemed a refreshing reshaping of the blues that gave birth to them. It's been great listening to this and the others I purchased along with it.

{"text":"Some of the finest R&B of the early-90s can be found on this outstanding debut by one of the most underrated singers of his generation. 'Kissing You' alone is worth the price of getting the whole album, but the title track, 'Are You Still In Love With Me', 'I'll Be There', and 'Closer' are standouts as well. The more uptempo tracks give Keith a bit more variety to work with and he handles 'em quite well, but the ballads are where he truly earns his keep. Too bad he wasn't kept to his strengths as a \"grown folks only\" artist after making such a powerful statement on his first solo effort and eventually left the music industry to do radio in his native hometown of Detroit. I just hope it's not a permanent career move for him because singers of this caliber are sorely missed in today's increasingly shallow and manufactured music scene.\n\nI also agree with another reviewer on here that Keith and Chante Moore should've done a complete album of duets at some point during that particular time period. They had some really good vocal chemistry together everytime they hooked up and most likely would've been the next great male\/female singing duo after Alexander O'Neal and Cherrelle if such a project had taken place back then. THAT truly was a missed opportunity on both their labels' part:::sigh:::\n\nHey Keith, stop putting your music career on extended hiatus AND GET BACK IN THE MIX FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE!!!!\n;-)","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"As a big Masta Killa fan, I was looking forward to this release, only to be disappointed by an abbreviated album lacking cohesion. The artist stated that he planned to put his \"soul\" into the project, hence the title. However, unlike symmetry and quality production on Ghostface Killah's R&B influenced \"Ghostdini: Wizard of Poetry\", this album is disjointed by a lack of consistent soul. On \"Wise Words\", Killa talks over Zapp's \"Be Alright\" which seems more like an uncreative sample of Tupac's \"Keep Your Head Up\" as opposed to a sampling of the original version. Killa actual takes production credit on this song, however, \"reproduction\" is a better term. On \"Divine Glory\" he takes a direct stab at R&B rap. Unfortunately, the song lacks any musical substance. At one point, the beat drops for about 30 seconds as Killa raps a cappella. Once the beat returns for another 45 seconds, the song is cut abruptly without wind-down. Perhaps the biggest disappointment on this album is \"Dirty Soul\" which is said to feature Ol' Dirty Bastard. Instead, we have another song with Killa speaking over the beat, paying tribute to various R&B groups. He eventually begins to honor several \"soul brothers\", including Ol' Dirty Bastard. Once this introduction is made, Killa proceeds to kick a verse imitating Dirty which is a far cry from an actual guest feature.\n\nThere are few noteworthy songs on this disc: \"Soul & Substance\", \"Things Just Not the Same\", \"Food\", and \"All Natural\", with the later song falling short of the three minutes. This is another problem with the album - all but four songs fall under four minutes. When you add this to a few unremarkable skits, along with one song (\"Wisdom\") that is basically a skit without an artist, you have what amounts to an EP. Making matters worse for hardcore Wu-Tang fans, the album is void of any appearance by a clan member. Instead, we're given \"Cali Sun\", a lifeless song featuring west coast artist Kurupt.\n\nMasta Killa may have struck a good idea when planning this project, however, the album lacks quality or punch. With six years separating his last release, this will be a disappointment for most fans. I take some satisfaction in supporting one of my favorite artists, but wonder how satisfied Masta Killa is with this album.","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"The pointblank outpouring of the feminine soul - in a state of anguish & mourning - receives its full measure in this exceptional classic \"Un-break My Heart\"; sung with truly unique voice inflections & intonations by Toni Braxton; composed & written by Diane Eve Warren. We hear our heroine pleading for and commanding her deceased or departed lover to return to her immediately to assauge her loss and hurt, \"Don't leave me in all this pain, Don't leave me out in the rain...\" The use of the imperative is so forceful and direct, it heightens the impact of the song, and renders us as wrung out with catharsis - as she is.\n\nBraxton's soft, silky utterances easily immerse the listener in the strength and power of her heavier vocal chords - when she pours it on, \"Say you'll love me again, Undo this hurt you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life; Un-cry these tears, I cried so many nights...Un-break my heart!\" The video for this song with its dramatic intensity lifts this rendition into being scene- and plot-driven, like \"Mourning Becomes Electra\" with the lights turned down.\n\nThis in turn builds plot and 'grief' motif within 'surround sound' orchestration. Braxton's intensity, her passionate request for her lover to return - becomes one of the more powerful crescendos in pop music. This would not be so - if her lips were sealed - they had to be un-sealed - her depth of expression from deep within her soul - may cause us to grieve (our catharsis, her purge of emotion). We listen to her final refrain and empathize with her loss. It is quite satisfying if not exhausting. We hope to be drenched in her emotional denouement upon re-playing this cinematic song. It is yours to enjoy when the mood is right.\n\n \"Bring back the nights when I held you beside me\n Un-break my heart\n Say you'll love me again\n Undo this hurt you caused\n When you walked out the door\n And walked out of my life\n Un-cry this tears\n I cried so many, many nights\n Un-break my\n Un-break my heart oh baby\n Come back and say you love me\n Un-break my heart\n Sweet darlin'\n Without you I just can't go on\n Can't go on....\"","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"The Script is a band that was enveloped in buzz since their first single no less than a year ago. It was probably one of the first bands since the Cranberries to make a big splash in the states from Ireland. Although, their first release made its mark in terms of song style and musicianship, the album as a whole was only good, but not great.\n\nNow, The Script are back again with 'Science & Faith' I was a little skeptical considering their first single off this album pretty much sounded like their first album, but once I gave the whole album a listen I was blown away. This band has definitely picked up the slack and perfected their work. Using incredible hooks in their guitar work and a unique mix of melody and rhyme The Script are now stronger than ever before. 'Science & Faith' is an awesome listen from start to finish every song is great, yet as always there are those that step above the others. The self titled track, 'If You Ever Come Back' & 'Long Gone' are just a few of the great songs you will hear and believe it or not 'For the First Time' is probably the weakest on the album. It's very much like the first 3EB album (meaning Semi-Charmed Life while it was a popular single was the worst song on the record) The sound of this band has changed a great deal they definitely picked a few good pieces from bands like U2, R.E.M. & others. I highly recommend this album if you just want a great listen from start to finish, because that is exactly what is. I am now officially a fan of The Script and I am very eager to see where their work will take them in the future.","classification":5,"fold":3}

Musically, she or her producer, Hal Willner, has taken a few positive strides.\n\nI do agree with others the lead-off track is one of the weakest on this disk. The repetativeness is completely distracting and not worthy of Willams' talents.  Ditto w\/\"Mama You Sweet\".\n\nThe strongest tracks are by far \"Unsuffer Me\", \"Where is My Love\", \"Rescue\", \"What If\" and \"Wrap My Head Around It\".  Especially the strings on \"Unsuffer Me\" and the guitar on \"Where is My Love\" really make the songs.  They are subtle yet make all the difference.\n\nI do like \"Fancy Funeral\", though it is a little down...even for me.  \"Come On\" starts really good, but it doesn't really go anywhere.\n\nThe good thing is, the rest of the songs are perfectly serviceable.  Nothing outstanding, but nothing making me hit the 'skip' button like I did with 'World Without Tears'.","classification":4,"fold":3}

Every song is a killer. It is a five star collection. BUT, there are many excellent Martha songs not included. Where's Livewire, In My Lonely Room, Wild One? There are others equally deserving that have been omitted. So, as good as this compilation is, it is far from perfect. You don't need to be a completist in order to regret the omissions.

{"text":"Ah, the Supreme Warbler!  She is to popular music what Florence Foster Jenkins was to classical.  Were they parody?  Or unfortunate victims of a cruel and greedy commercial machine that used them up like oil and spat them out when they were spent?  There were, after all, musical satirists like Anna Russell and much later, The Bonzo Dog Band and Monty Python, who reeked havoc with their sonic exploits, and made pots of money doing it, too.  But they knew exactly what they were doing.  What about Mrs. Miller?\n\nJonathan & Darlene Edwards came along years before Mrs. Miller, but I only discovered them many years after I fell in love with Mrs. Miller.  The former act was, in case some readers don't know it already, a gifted piano player\/bandleader Paul Weston, and a supreme vocal stylist known in popular vocalist circles as a singer's singer, Jo Stafford.  She eventually became Weston's wife.  They were best known as themselves, but forged a separate career in musical parody.  What made me convulse with laughter when I was in the mood to listen to these two cutting up vinyl was the knowledge that bad singing isn't easy, and Jo did it by singing sharp.  Try it.  It's harder than singing flat; believe me (and sounds even more horrible).  Now, you may be asking, what do Jonathan and Darlene Edwards have to do with Mrs. Miller?  For me, it's personal, but it may help me to explain the appeal of Mrs. Miller to so many people.\n\nI tried to introduce a foreign-born coworker in an office where I worked to Jonathan and Darlene.  He would have none of it.  He said, \"she's doing that deliberately; that's not funny.\"  You see I had previously turned him on to the giddy delights of Mrs. Miller.  In prying my friend for answers as to why he found Jonathan and Darlene NOT funny, and Mrs. Miller roll-on-the-floor hysterical, I got an unexpected response.  No, he said Mrs. Miller is like your grandmother singing your favorite popular songs to you, and maybe even some songs you hate.  Somehow, she's innocent, charming, and yes, very, very funny.  Whatever the true story, and you'll read of several in these Amazon reviews, what the person called Mrs. Miller left us was a small body of crystalline comedic treasures.  She may or may not have been exploited, or she may have exploited herself, but she was an otherwise nobody who became immortal.\n\nJust listen to these miracles of concise humor and comic mistiming.  How can you not laugh and love this woman all at the same time?  And face it, who's gonna take \"Sweet Pea,\" \"Catch A Falling Star\" and \"I've Got A Tiger By the Tail\" seriously, anyway?  This music was ripe for a little destructive reinterpreting.  And her \"Boots?\"  Sorry, Nancy, Mrs. Miller's is The Definitive Version.\n\nMy one, small criticism of this nearly complete compilation is the omission of \"Up, Up And Away.\"  Talk about Definitive! (If you're a Mrs. Miller fan already, and haven't heard \"Up, Up and Away,\" you owe it to yourself to hunt down this delightful rarity). But perhaps the best moment on this particular collection is when Mrs. Miller hits that high note in \"Lover's Concerto.\"  She NAILS it!  And people said she couldn't sing!\n\nI think Jonathan and Darlene Edwards had the harder task, both musically, and as comedians, but they could always have the perspective in life that they had a goof, enjoyed it, made some money, and did it with purpose; you can even hear them winking in their recordings.  I do think they are funny, but in a very different way from how Mrs. Miller is funny.  My coworker was right about one thing:  Mrs. Miller was Grandma.  And you might laugh WITH her and even AT her when her back was turned, but never would you sneer at her face to face.  No, you want to give her a hug, because somehow these crazy, one-of-a-kind creations exemplify the best that comedy has to offer.  I completely disagree with those who say that laughing at Mrs. Miller's music is cruel.  I think Mrs. Miller might have understood, had she lived to witness her digital revival, that she had created something entertaining and unique, even if it wasn't taken as she had intended.  Nothing to be ashamed of there, and if her life was in some ways tragic, its legacy is not the least bit sad.","classification":5,"fold":3}

In retrospect, if you're still playing Stones albums -- and you should be -- these three hold up among the best. The new Universal remasters are so fine it's scary. What a gorgeous job. I've got a $10,000 stereo, and, trust me, it's been dying to hear CDs that sound this good. Those of you on mp3 and music on the computer and iPod and all that, you do not know what you're missing. All others, give \"Black and Blue\" a revisit. The Stones are not emphasizing songs here, but the old line that this was the album they just tried out new guitarists after Mick Taylor split is lazy reviewing become accepted fact. The Stones are in superb, coiled form here. Yes, there are not a lot of songs, but the band was exploring jams at this point, tinged with Jamaican vibes, dance floor repetition and nuance in the shifting layers of sound and rhythm. \"Hot Stuff,\" \"Hey Negrita\" -- both are brilliant. The two ballads are classics. Crazy Mama, particularly in the remaster, is an overwhelmingly joyful rocker from the Faces school. \"Melody\" is a great lost Stones song, and the semi-duds (\"Hand of Fate,\" which some love, and \"Cherry Oh Baby\") certainly are not embarrassing.

It's a full-frontal attitude piece, reminiscent in spirit of the earlier \"Hero Takes A Fall.\" The thing that set The Bangles apart from other \"girl groups\" from the beginning was the attitude...that sideways look from Susanna in the \"Walk Like An Egyptian\" video, for starters.

{"text":"US trio Yeasayer are musical magpies, cut from the same colourful cloth as acts like MGMT  or Santogold. \"Odd Blood\" is their sophomore disc, comprising catchy jittery electronic Pop with a myriad of influences.\n\nThe woozy \"Strange Reunions\" has a Middle Eastern feel as does \"Madder Red\" (with a hummed wordless chorus), while the psychedelic clap-filled ballad \"I Remember\" is remniscent of \"Animal Collective\". At 10 tracks, no two songs are alike. Their debut CD was beautifully fractured psychedelic Folk\/Pop, and they retain their strong sense of melody despite the change in style.\n\nOther standouts are the Radiohead-style \"The Children\" (with eerie vocodered vocals and clanking beats), the tribal-sounding \"O.N.E.\", the progressively trancey \"Love Me Girl\" (my favourite), the bouncy \"Rome\"  with stabbing syths & the experimental ballad \"Grizelda\".\n\nOtherworldly and highly infectious!","classification":5,"fold":3}

It really is one of those few songs that captures beauty from voice and all. It really is an amazing and intimate ode. It honestly is too bad that the British trio of the 80's was never able to achieve that kind of status. Nevertheless, I really am glad the song is finally available as a download.

{"text":"I'm gonna complain a bit here - the live Devotion (off Gratitude, killer studio version made furtherly killer live) and Keep Your Head to the Sky are still missing. Why? Is this one of those stupid cross-label things? Because those are really annoying. And this contains Boogie Wonderland, most likely their worst hit, either that or Let's Groove. Both are disco. Not a coincidence. And they drop All About Love, as well as I'll Write a Song for You. Give me a break! Four of their greatest songs, dropped off a cliff. Splat. Why? Saturday Night's an OK song, but I don't see it as the Best of Earth Wind and Fire. But if you swap those three off, put the four I mentioned on, and keep the rest, you've got the real best of Earth, Wind and Fire. Unlike the 1978 Greatest Hits release, this DOES contain Mighty Mighty, Kalimba Story AND Serpentine Fire, three essentials. Plus it adds After the Love is Gone, a worthy addition to any self-respecting EWF hits collection (or at least any one released after 1978), and their greatest song ever maybe. I'd bet on it. Plus nine of the ten tracks on the '78 release, not coincidentially the nine classics (Got to Get You Into My Life, Fantasy, Can't Hide Love, Getaway, That's the Way of the World, Shining Star, September, Reasons, Sing a Song) - note how they dropped Love Music, which is cool by me because it's just an average song and average songs don't belong on best-ofs, even if they were huge hits (*cough cough Saturday Nite*).\n\nYes, this is a great intro, but don't stop here. Why? All in All, Spirit, Gratitude, That's the Way of the World and Open Our Eyes are all good picks, that's why. But this is the compilation the band deserved.","classification":5,"fold":3}

It isn't one I pop in often or with excitement when I want to hear the three or four songs I like.  A few of the songs could have easily been on a Foster produced CD and been fine but not all together on one CD. One particular song stands out but as the one I intensely dislike which I won't name so people can form their own opinions but I've read other reviews that didn't like it, either. It tortures me to say it but some lyrics just aren't good. Overall, some songs I like but none I can say I love. Whereas David Foster tended towards overproduction and overkill, Rick Rubin has the exact opposite problem, not enough input. This all being said, it's still Josh Groban singing and that's a far sight better than some of the stuff that's passed off as singing these days. Sorry, Josh.","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"'The Soul Purpose' was an exceptionally good release from 7L & Eso that was really unfairly hated upon.  It was a 20 track CD filled with a lot of good songs (\"Speaking Real Words\" \"Jealous Over Nothing\", accompanied by some average tracks (\"You Know The Concept\" \"Mic Mastery\"), and a few that didn't come all that well (\"Guestlist\")...  It probably was hated upon because of Eso's previous cyborg-android scientific type of material switched over to a cocky arrogant battler with simpler rhyming schemes.\nWhere ever there were mistakes on 'The Soul Purpose', 'Dangerous Connection' not only corrects them, but PERFECTS everything on the album!  Every single track is banging on this album!!  7L's mediocre production has improved exponentially and Esoteric's flow just compliments the beats even more.  Plus if you felt that there was too much battle type of material on the last album, 'Dangerous Connection' comes with a bunch of good conceptual songs...\n\"Terrorist's Cell\" - first off ANYTHING produced by Stoupe (jedi mind tricks) will have an off the wall type of beat.  Esoteric's lyrics explain the mind of a 9\/11 terrorist going through with his crusade... but after finally seeing his wrongdoing it's too late... This is not only a controversial song, but it is executed INCREDIBLY well (the re-play button will be on this for a few times)...\n\"Word Association\" - another creative track where Esoteric raps about being a psychotic patient rapping 'word association' with a doctor.  A very humorous track...\n\"Stalker\" - a hilarious tale about a guy who stalks teenage girls that he has fantasies of... this runs along the same type of humor \"Jealous over Nothing\" had...\n\"Herb\" - along with teenyboppers and Nelly fans, herbs are something else I detest.  Esoteric arrogantly defines the term herb all throughout the track ...\n\"Rest In Peace\" - a clever concept song where Eso rhymes about himself passing on and how his music ALL OF A SUDDEN is known, and how there are album profit problems among his family and friends...\nAnd the rest of the tracks are the usual Esoteric battle\/android type of material... NOTHING on this material is WEAK by any means (there are no blunders like Guestlist)...  The ONLY thing that annoyed me about this CD is that it was kinda short in comparison with Soul Purpose.  But the REALLY hot beats and rhymes make up for the length... remember its QUALITY folks not QUANTITY\nsupport underground hiphop\nI'm out... Mind power!!!","classification":5,"fold":3}

For the first time, I really heard the simplicity of her new voice. Gone were those high notes and fancy vocal gymnastics of her early days. Instead, there was a new voice of someone who had gone through an experience and was still struggling to survive it. I liked her new voice and really wish that her audience would have allowed her to explore it more instead of criticizing her for not sounding like she did in the early years. As I continued to drive, I noticed water streaming down my cheeks as I thought about the prophetic nature of the song for her life and vocal treasure we lost.

{"text":"**EDIT\/UPDATE on 2\/6\/15**\n\nMy short review: 'E*MO*TION' is the '80s-influenced album Taylor Swift wishes she had made (no hate, though!)\n\nNow, for my lengthy review: When Carly Rae Jepsen was thrown into the spotlight (outside of her native Canada, anyway) she simply became the \"Call Me Maybe\" girl.  Sure, \"CMM\" was the catchiest \/love-to-hate track of 2012, but it immediately placed Jepsen into dangerous one-hit-wonder territory.\n\nAlso didn't help Jepsen's cause when, [her mainstream debut album] 'Kiss' debuted Sept. 2012 [w\/ \"CMM\" strategically placed front\/center on said album's track listing], the song was so overplayed by that point!\n\nResult? 'Kiss' =disappointing album (not to mention follow-up singles) sales; the album as a whole failed to impact listeners, charts\/radio & top the inescapable \"CMM\".  Critics quickly wrote Jepsen off as, not only a one-hit-wonder, but a nuisance of \/pun to the music industry in general...\n\n'E*MO*TION' - however - proves Jepsen's not only a singles-selling artist, but a viable album-selling artist w\/ so much more to offer than people give this girl credit for!  And while Jepsen may not have the strongest singing voice (she still sounds quite young for someone pushing the big 3-0), she holds her own on this frothy, '80s-inspired pop album.\n\n[recalling my opening statement] While 'E*MO*TION' vs. '1989' debate continues to run wild (simply because both albums respectively hype the \"retro\" factor) - Carly, however, has the upper hand here:\n\nWhile Tay's '1989' is - by textbook definition - a very strong \/quality pop album in it's own right (no hate here; see my own prior review of TS '1989'), '1989' merely skims the surface (adding small touches \/hints of '80s synths thrown in here & there).\n\n'E*MO*TION' dives deeper into music of the past - following more in tune with the Debbies, Tiffanys, Taylors [Dane] of yesteryear.  With her second effort, Jepsen definitely pulled a 180 - managing to put out one of the strongest pop releases in a while...\n\nTrack list \/Notes:\n\n1. Run Away With Me - shares a similar beat to Mike Posner's \"Cooler Than Me\".  Perhaps not the best choice for a single, though.\n\n2. Emotion - Carly nails the pure '80s pop-influenced awesomeness all rolled into one on this track(:  One of my favorites on here.\n\nImmediately reminded me of \"Come Go With Me by Expos along w\/ [song title similarities + same key aside] Whitney Houston's \"So Emotional\".  Also recalls Madonna's \"Lucky Star\".\n\n3. I Really Like You - defiantly VERY repetitive (not to mention a questionable lead single choice) ...just trying to recapture \/cash in on the annoyingly-cutesy fluffiness that was \"Call Me Maybe\".\n\nNothing special.  It also throws off the '80s vibe on this album Carly was initially aiming for.  Oh well, I'm sure her label just threw this song on here for good measure.\n\n4. Gimmie Love - I enjoy Jepsen's cool, yet delicate vocals on this track.  Sounds a like a mix of Bruno Mars' \"Treasure\" & Selena Gomez's track, \"Hands To Myself\".\n\n5. All That - a nice slow jam that shows a different side of Carly.  Slightly sexual undertones throughout, but not to the point of making Carly sound like she's going astray.  The track's ending is a little odd, though (it just come to an abrupt - & slighly eerie - halt).\n\n6. Boy Problems - wouldn't have sounded completely out of place on 'Kiss' (not to mention Swift's '1989' album)\n\n7. Making The Most Of The Night - showstopper!  My favorite track on here!  Love the fleeting yet effective [major, minor, then return to major] key change in the chorus; makes for an interesting\/unique track.  Clever\/well written.\n\n8. Your Type - the pre-chorus here vaguely recalls Taylor Swift's \"WANEGBT\" [where Tay talk-sings, \"I hate you \/ We breakup \/ You call me \/ I love you\"].  Sounds like a track Swift could've recorded for '89.\n\n9. Let's Get Lost - Gorgeous song that's perfect for Spring\/Summer.  Beautiful melody!  Carly's pretty vocals are perfect for this song\n\n10. LA Hallucinations - interesting, especially since Carly recorded this...it's different\n\n11. Warm Blood - weakest track on the album; could've been better. *perhaps this track's included to compete [title-wise] w\/ Swift's own \"Bad Blood\" ?  Just a thought...*\n\n12. When I Needed You\n\nDeluxe Edition tracks:\n13. Black Heart - a cutesy techno track...sounds like disco Tetris(:\n\n14. I Didn't Just Come Here To Dance - another one of the stronger tracks here.\n\n15. Favourite Color - Another soft, pleasant [mid-tempo?] track that shows off Carly's delicate vocals perfectly!\n\nTarget-exclusive tracks:\n16. Never Get to Hold You - the spacey [word?], airy chorus recalls \"Alien\" by Britney Spears (no outer space pun intended).\n\n17. Love Again\n\nStandouts Tracks: 2, 7, 14-16\n\n-Chloe","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Iron Maiden's golden age started with \"Killers\" and pretty much ended with \"Somewhere in Time\". All of the songs on \"Somewhere\" are ambitious, adding new elements to Maiden's sound. The guitar synth's found on \"Somewhere\" are present, but not as overpowering as on the follow-up cd \"Seventh Son\". Everything Maiden fans enjoy about the band are present on \"Somewhere\". Steve Harris' bass lines crackle, and Dickinson's urgent vocals really carry the album along. The guitar riffs are catchy, and hook you right away. The thing that always impressed me with Iron Maiden, was that, during the 80's most metal bands like Ratt, Posion, Motley Crue etc, were busy playing and singing about rock n' roll, girls and partying. Maiden often based their music on literature; \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\", poetry: \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", history; \"Aces High\", \"The Trooper\" and \"Run to the Hills\"; religion; \"Heaven Can Wait\", \"Number of the Beast\" and mythology \"Icarus\" and \"Poweslave\". The great epic metal tunes on Iron Maiden disks defied the conventions of the time, where most bands stuck to radio-friendly, 5 minutes or less rock anthems. Iron Maiden was, and is more than just a standard metal band, and if you are a music fan, you are doing yourself a great dis-service if you don't pick up the disks from the heyday. \"Somewhere in Time\" features 8 great track, each better than the one before it. Listen to \"Alexander the Great\" and ask yourself if any other band at the height of their popularity would have been able to put that song on a cd. The guitar riff on \"Wasted Years\" will be running through your head all day, and you will be humming the chorus of \"Heaven Can Wait\" for a long time. This is a great album, from a band that always brought a little more to the table than just catchy rock anthems.","classification":5,"fold":3}

This is THAT cd that the fav alternates with each spin.  Right now, track #2 is my fav, but I'm sure that will change.

{"text":"Well, Brian Warner must have read my review for his last album, 2012's \"Born Villain\" where I opined that he trim the fat off his bloated albums and give us something to rock to--and bring his 'A' game.\n\nHere it is, \"The Pale Emperor\". Ten tracks (nice!) and a focus not heard or seen since 2003's \"The Golden Age Of Grotesque\". The lyrics draw you in. The music draws you in. Overall, a solid effort, but not the five star effort I believe he is still capable of.\n\n\"Killing Strangers\", \"Deep Six\", \"Third Day Of A Seven Day Binge\", \"The Mephistopheles Of Los Angeles\", \"Slave Only Dreams To Be King\", \"\"The Devil Beneath My Feet\", \"Birds Of Hell Awaiting\" and even \"Cupid Carries A Gun\" are all notable tracks. The only weak tracks being \"Warship My Wreck\" and \"Odds Of Even\".\n\nNow, I see some reviewers longing for the early days of Marilyn Manson, but I say those days were spent refining and honing musical chops. To met, \"Portrait Of An American Family\" and \"Antichrist Superstar\" were repetitive and in some respects, immature. Signs of a budding artist. By 1998's \"Mechanical Animals\" you could tell that Mr. Warner had a stronger, more concise vision of what he wanted to accomplish both lyrically and musically.\n\nSo, basically, all Mr. Warner has to do now is polish his music, adhering to the ten track, 45 minute limit set forth. Bring more rockers like \"Deep Six\" and keep the slow, meandering tracks off unless they're very good. The thing that really makes \"The Pale Emperor\" work is that it sounds like Marilyn Manson, but different in a good way. I think if Mr. Warner wrote a politically charged album taking aim at several artifices of American society (and kept it short and to the point, with plenty of hard rocking angst) that he might have a classic on his hands.\n\nHere's how \"The Pale Emperor\" compares to Marilyn Manson's previous works:\n\n1994 Portrait Of An American Family: Three Stars\n1996 Antichrist Superstar: Three Stars\n1998 Mechanical Animals: Four Stars\n2000 Holywood: Four Stars\n2003 The Golden Age Of Grotesque: Four Stars\n2007 Eat Me, Drink Me: Three Stars\n2009 The High End Of Low: Three Stars\n2012 Born Villain: Three Stars\n2015 The Pale Emperor: Four Stars","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"While Pinecastle Records has been around for just a little over twenty years, it has recorded such bluegrass stalwarts as Jim & Jesse and The Osborne Brothers. However, this 12-track sampler focuses more on the new and upcoming acts on its roster.\n\nAccording to the Pinecastle Records website, Mark Newton & Steve Thomas had the No. 1  song with \"Old MacDonald Sold the Farm\" on Bluegrass Today's weekly Top 20 chart last month. Tracks on this collection range from Town Mountain's old timey \"Sugar Mama,\" to Grasstowne's lightning fast picking on \"Big Big Heartaches,\" to the gospel strains of Nu-Blu's \"Martha and Mary.\"\n\nIf you're looking for an opportunity to treat your ears to some of the newer sounds in bluegrass music today, ULTIMATE BLUEGRASS is an excellent sampler. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED [Running Time - 39:00]","classification":4,"fold":3}

I'm sure the fact that this recording was made in the early 90s must have also helped but as far as this being a worthy cover of Rimsky-Korsakov's brilliant masterpiece is concerned, fear not as Yuri Temirkanov and the New York Philharmonic have done an excellent job here.  Great sound quality and wonderful performances of a brilliant work of music make this very highly recommended indeed.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Robert Johnson, blues pioneer and legend, would turn 100 next month if he were still alive.  In celebration of his centennial, his all-too-brief catalog-- 29 master takes and 13 alternates-- has been reissued.\n\nAs I'm sure a lot of you reading this already have these recordings in some form or another, I'm going to start by talking about the presentation of this material.  Put simply-- this set is a revelation of sound-- it's remarkable, both the 1990 collection (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Complete-Recordings\/dp\/B000002ADN\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Complete Recordings<\/a>) and the later reissues of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/King-of-Delta-Blues-Singers\/dp\/B00000AG6X\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">King of Delta Blues Singers<\/a>&nbsp;all have that \"pre-World War II reissue sound\".  Many of you know what I mean, scratches, pops, microphone hiss, etc.  It lends a certain charm to the music, but it can certainly change the listening experience.  This recording is remarkably free of that-- crisp, clean, clear, no artifacts of age or old media.  It's really amazing, I've never heard anything from this era that sounds like this, it has my salivating at the potential for remastering other pre-WWII music and it really brings Johnson to life-- with such clarity, both his singing and guitar playing leap off the recordings.\n\nAnd really, that brings me back to the recordings, a true treasure of their era, Robert Johnson was a powerfully talented man.  Generally recognized for his guitar playing (rumor has it he sold his soul to the Devil to attain such mastery), Johnson was also a singer of fierce power, channeling deep and powerful emotions and demonstrating excellent flexibility in his voice.  Accompanying himself on guitar, Johnson demonstrates remarkable technique, instantly recognizable as his own and never really replicated by anyone else.  I think it was best summed up by Keith Richards, who famously asked when hearing Johsnon, \"who is the other guy playing with him?\"\n\nThe songs themselves have been covered and re-covered so many times, in many ways they're instantly familiar to us.  To hear Johnson perform though is often a revelation-- he can bring forth such emotions seemingly at will, haunted fear (\"Hellhound on My Trail\"), anxiety (\"Ramblin' On My Mind\") and ecstacy (\"They're Red Hot\").  But for me, when he's at his best is when there's almost an acceptance of a dark resolution-- \"Me and the Devil Blues\" and \"Cross Road Blues\" come immediately to mind.  It's something I've never quite heard in anyone else's music, and certainly the many, many covers of the latter are simply lacking in comparison.\n\nThe bottom line is, these recordings are essential parts of music history, it's hard to overstate this, and should be investigated by virtually any serious music fan.  For those who have previous issues of these recordings, the sonic upgrade here is to my ears worth the investment.  Highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Dear Music Appreciators,\n\nWhy is this a great album that you should buy right now?  Because this is a half-female half-male band playing alternative rock with pop appeal and punk attitude, and playing it well.  Yes, they sound like the nineties sometimes and yes supposedly this is the bands first album in like ten years and maybe there has been some breakup drama in the past or whatever, but maybe none of that really matters all that much if you think about it.  All that stuff is just filler.\n\nOn GHOST NOTES youll find heavy riffs, Ann Wilson-esque wailing, and in-your-face attitude vs. gentle guitar, hushed vocals, and even some touches of vulnerability, despite the its gonna get loud, its gonna get heavy forewarning on the opening track.  Empty Bottle displays the bands full range of powers and dynamics and its good to find such a strong song anchoring the middle of the record instead of weighing down the front end.  And there are plenty more strong songs to be found on GHOST NOTES, all studded with memorable moments.  Notice how the meandering slow intro to \"Black and Blonde morphs into a heavy, room-shaking riff.  Notice the triple rhymes and rapid fire wordplay of Laughing in the Sugar Bowl, See if you can spot the subtle tribute to Simon and Garfunkels Cecelia on The Museum of Broken Relationships,  Try and find a song that isn't interesting in some way.  Maybe you can do it but I couldnt.\n\nWhen I was younger I had a roommate from Uruguay, and whenever he encountered an American food he wasn't familiar with, before trying it he would ask me is this a sweet or a salt?  If he was here to ask me that question about Veruca Salts new album, I would tell him its both.  Yes, my Uruguayan roommate, despite her name,  this Veruca is both sweet and salty, and that quality, that contrast between the soft and loud, light and heavy, pretty and pained, is just one of many reasons why GHOST NOTES is such a satisfying listen.  Now get me a Snickers bar, beeyotch\n\nSincerely,\n\nConstant Listener","classification":5,"fold":3}
{"text":"With their previous album, the self-titled one, American Progressive Metal band Queensrche had the eyes of the world on them due to the much publicized split with Geoff Tate and the existence of two competing Queensrches. There was the intrigue of a new singer, and the theyve gone back to their Metal roots tagline to get everyones attention. Luckily, It was a brilliant album, but people wouldve been paying attention anyway. In 2015, with all the dust settled, and no more special taglines, the band have to sink or swim solely on the merits of the music.\n\nLike their previous self-titled effort, Condition H&uuml;man was crowdfunded, and if like me you pledged Im sure youll already be very familiar with the first three tracks which the band let you download while you waited for the full album to be released. As it turns out, these three tracks are actually a pretty fair cross-section of the album proper and display the different moods explored on the record quite adequately. Opening with Arrow Of Time which is now firmly in the bands live setlists, the band show off their Heavy Metal roots, going for a remember, we wrote Queen Of The Ryche and The Needle Lies too you know! sort of feel. Promotional single Guardian is next which I would say is the average sound of the album overall, so go out and listen to the song and watch the video because I think it is a pretty clear indication of what you can expect from the band nowadays. Then comes the slower, darker, less conventional Hellfire which explores the progressive side of the band  never going so far as to have a 7-minute keyboard solo or songs about flowers developing split personalities in space, but certainly finds the Seattle group putting more thought into structuring, dynamics and unusual ideas than your average bread and butter Heavy Metal bands would. It wouldnt feel too out of place on Promised Land beside Damaged or even Hear In The Now Frontier beside Hit The Black at a push but theres a more modern feel too it making it feel more like a logical successor to the type of music the band were writing on Operation Mindcrime II (an underrated album in my opinion).\n\nThe band do explore more of their overall discography on this one, which feels fair to me. It was unquestionably good to go back to the EP-Empire days, but it would also be a shame to outright ignore the best parts of what came afterwards and keep an artificial boundary in place forever. This album seems to be a reconciling of the previous Todd-fronted album with the post-Empire material to excellent effect; Selfish Lies for example sounds at first like a bit the Tribe album, then goes a bit Empire-esque towards the end once the delicious album-highlight guitar solo comes in. Eye9 opens with a nice Tool-esque bassline and heavily processed vocals that reminds me of a mixture between I Am I and The Hostage from previous releases, but the song takes so many twists and turns in its duration it crosses all sorts of territory from American Soldier to Rage For Order, and when the (also album highlight) guitar solo came on for the first time it made my already high estimation of the song double or even triple (the lead guitar on this album is simply joyous!). Most surprising of all, Just Us is an acoustic-flavoured, jangly Alternative Rock song that wouldnt be out of place on either Hear In The Now Frontier or Q2K and even though the thought of that is off-putting to a lot of the fanbase, well, the rejuvenated band show us how good it can be, (and hey, when youve not got a full album of it, it works as a nice contrast) injecting an almost Houses Of The Holy feel into the proceedings and elevating it to something special.\n\nThe album lasts twelve tracks long, (with one of those just being an intro for the final song), and clocks in at 54 minutes, which is a lot more substantial than the trim and cheerful album which the Todd-lineup debuted with. Not only is it in the addition of more tracks that this extra length manifests itself, but the individual tracks themselves are all a little longerthe previous records tracks all lasted between two-and-a-half to four minutes in length and this album sees that average shift to something like between four and five, with the final track lasting almost eight. What you get for your extra invested time isn't simple repetition or wasted time or filler you get extra guitar solos, more thoughtful and sophisticated song writing and the ability to work in slower tempos alongside the fist-pumping Metal. You could make an argument that it isn't as lean and focused, but you could also make the argument that theres more depth.\n\nYes my two favourite songs are predictably Arrow Of Time and All There Was, (which just happen to be the two most traditional songs on the record and the closest that the album comes to Speed Metal because Im dreadfully predictable) but the bands experimentation here is a profound success with the records most progressive moment, the album-closing Title Track being not only one of the best songs on the album but one of the best songs the band have written in years and years, ending on an almost Voivod note and showing the guys still aren't afraid to try new things.\n\nAll the background history and discography comparisons certainly get you to adjust your expectations, to guess what type of music might be here and get you interested in talking about it but its all for nothing unfortunately, if the actual music is cack. Well, to put your mind at ease, it isn't cack. Not by a long shot stick on Hourglass and just drink in those vocals, stick on one of the aforementioned guitar solos and bathe in the whips distinctive playing, pay close attention to the drum fills and hi-hat teasing from the unique and enjoyable Scott Rockenfield (in my opinion, one of the most important things in separating Queensrche from their peers). Yes, the musicianship is out of this world, with the same renewed passion and energy as the last album but more time to show off in! On top of that, the production job is better, with a more satisfying, less harsh sound and a clearer more balanced mix.\n\nOverall; Condition H&uuml;man was a surprise to me, but a really welcome one. I love the Todd line-up and Ive loved their previous album so much that I still cant stop listening to it ahead of numerous other classic releases, so when this record abandoned the formula slightly it couldve been a bad move for this particular listener but hey, the whole point of Queensrche was that they evolve between every album, never sounding the same twice. This album is not only another evolution, but a reaffirmation of everything that worked with every era of the bands prestigious history, and its an album Ill be listening to for a long time to come.

There's a lot of experiment in style in this song - it starts at a good clip for Ciara's tongue-twisting lyrics, then slows down significantly in parts, before segueing into a quick rap portion. It's definitely worth looking into for the variety of sound on display here, although I doubt everyone will like it.\n\nLike all Amazon MP3 downloads, this MP3 is DRM-free and plays beautifully, without fuss on my MP3 player.\n\n~ Ana Mardoll","classification":3,"fold":3}

Mitropoulos had a brilliant way of conducting modern music that wasn't heard too often back then, with a conducting style that was once compared to a \"Byzantine monk furiously shaking martinis\". One of the composers he excelled in was Gustav Mahler, back when Mahler was rarely heard. This is a live performance of the \"Tragic\" sixth symphony from April 10th, 1955. It is very, very, good, if a bit flawed in a few places. For one thing, the sound quality is surprisingly good for a live recording from the mid 50's. But, there is a patch of some kind of electrical hiss or whirl in the fourth movement. Maybe it's the download or it's the original recording, but it's very annoying. Fortunately, it only lasts about 2 or 3 minutes. The audience is not too intrusive with coughing and such.\n  As for the actual performance, it's fantastic. The work moves at a nice pace and sounds like the sixth should at almost all the right spots. The second and third movements are presented as andante followed by the scherzo. You know, one way you can always tell a true Mahler fan apart is to ask them the question \"Which do you prefer, scherzo before andante, or andante before scherzo?\" A true fan will know just what you mean, and then be emphatic on their opinion of the order of those movements. I have always preferred the Scherzo before the andante, perhaps because that's the way I first heard the symphony. You know what they say about first impressions. Plus, I feel IMHO that you need that long, beautiful andante to come before the nearly 30 minute finale. The metabolism, or \"Blood Pressure\" if you will, of the work needs to slow and calm down in order to prepare both you and itself for that finale. Could you imagine Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the molto vivace scherzo coming right before the Ode to Joy finale, and not the slow movenent? The same goes for Bruckner's Symphony No. 8 or Mahler's Fourth. Now I can't damn the performance or recording because of this. It's a personal preference, and of course andante before scherzo does work for a lot of Mahlerites.\n  In the end, this recording is for die-hard Mahler fans. Or die-hard Mitropoulos fans. If you want a good first recording of the sixth, try Pierre Boulez and the VPO on DG, which is the best version I've ever heard. George Szell also does great version with the Cleveland Orchestra, now out of print I think. As for Bernstein, the second version, on DG from the 80's is also a must have.--------------PEACE","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"There are some musicians that don't have to prove to a younger generation what classic music really is. For Billy Joel, who has made great pop songs for nearly 20 years, his song still sound just as vibrant and distinctive as they did when they first came out back in the 70's, the 80's, and even the 90's. Sometimes the distinctive and classic style of a great songwriter still can deliver better than the joke artists of today. That has shown with Piano Man, New York State Of Mind and the classic We Didn't Start The Fire. The song still lights up the flame 25 years later after it originally came out and it still sounds just as driven as it did years ago. I still never get tired of the rhythm and rhyme into a great history lesson through time, as Joel pointed out into the song, and it still is better than the wasted acts of today. Maybe they should try and make a fire that still works like this song shown all this time.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":".\n\"Two times and I take a round. Will you forgive me?\" - Bad Habits refrain\n\nFive DETERMINED Stars. \"Bad Habits\" (Uncut) is an excellent track by the acclaimed Grammy-winning soul\/R&B composer and singer, Maxwell, from his 2009 album: the Grammy-winning, platinum-selling \"BLACKsummers'night\". The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart and is part of a planned trilogy which was followed by the 2016 album \"blackSUMMERsnight\". The musical group includes Frederico Pena on keyboards, Shedrick Mitchel on organ, Keyon Harrold on trumpet, Kenneth Whalum III on saxophones, and Saunders Sermons II on trombone. Maxwell executes his sensual, but cryptic PG lyrics as he describes an intense meeting with a lover that builds when trumpeter Harrold, saxophonist Whalum, and trombonist Sermons join forces in the background. There is some Marvin Gaye influence in subject matter, horn use, and mood, but with Maxwell's originality. Produced by MUSZE (Maxwell) and Hod David. Highly Recommended with sensual cautions.

{"text":"This is one of my personal favorites from Lenny. Nothing fancy here, just him finally closing the chapter on that soulful psychedelic rock sound that's been such a mainstay in his music for much of his career in proper fashion. The production is what impresses me on this one, though. I get the feeling Adam Johns (R.I.P.) was one of his biggest influences in that particular area. That thick drum snap, that deep-bottom bass, and that noticeable crunch of those guitar riffs can make even the most longtime classic rock fan smile with glee at what Lenny was able to accomplish here. Ballads are also noteworthy, with the one dedicated to his late father (Sy Kravitz) being extremely poignant. They also balance out the rockier tracks quite nicely. 4-stars is about right since I'm rating this album against the rest of his back catalog and it's one rating Lenny has definitely earned at that point in time. I almost wrote him off as washed-up after putting out that hot misguided mess known as 'Baptism' four years prior to this release, but I'm so darn relieved he did an about-face just in the nick of time. 'It's Time For A Love Revolution' in hindsight could be seen as an unofficial prelude to Lenny's third leg of his ongoing music career which has seen him peak yet again on the following albums 'Black and White America' and 'Strut' (another personal fave of mine). Most artists, especially in rock, don't usually stay relevant once they enter middle age. Count Lenny as one of the few exceptions to that rule!","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"There are definitely sometimes where a artist can get so experimental, that the quality of the songs dies as well as the heart in the mind. For Ed Sheeran, who based hip hop music to inspire his work, well, it honestly hasn't really shown to be good for his songwriting. While I was not very impressed with his last song Sing from the album X, he definitely needed to do better and sadly that is not the case with his latest song. Don't, the second single from his second album X, feels like it is more urban on the guitar, than driven into the song. Surprisingly, I found this song to be a real departure from the simplicity of the songs that made him a knockout from the beginning like The A Team and Lego House. I really found Sing to be a twist backwards, separating himself from good music, and Don't shows that following. I absolutely do not recommend the song. Listen to the music from Plus, than see if you like the music from X.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":3}

When I heard she even went back to the man who abused her before the Grammys, Chris Brown dating again, I must honestly say she has made a absolute low in her life. That has also shown in her music as well. Pour It Up, the second single from her Unapologetic album is absolutely one of the most mediocre songs she has ever made. It really didn't drive her voice, instead it just was a attempt to drive into her vice. I really found this to be worse than mostly all of the ballads she had done, with the exception of Hate That I Love You. Her rifts seemed soft, but not striking here. In fact, it made more like the purr of a cat, than a growl from a tigress. She really needs a hard look at her voice, before she makes another poor song.\n\nSong: D-","classification":2,"fold":3}

{"text":"Some of the best stuff out there is Indie. I heard this song on the radio the other day for the first time, I loved it, and so I bought it that same night. An example of a great Indie movie I've seen recently is called Another Earth, if you haven't already, you need to see that movie. Indie in general still has that artistic integrity. I hope Indie isn't brutally murdered by the conglomerate boardrooms who want to get a hold of popular stuff so that they can bend it like a pretzel until it's assembly line ready for mass consumption. However, it's true, not all Indie is good, but Gotye is so good, that I was surprised to discover that they were Indie in the first place.\n\nThis brings me to a personal annoyance. The movie industry gladly accept Indie, heck, they even through them a set of awards to nurture their talent. The music industry also has extended open arms to Indie artists with shows like American Idol, but the publishing world shuns Indie talent as self-published, which is their way of being snobbishly derogatory toward those that are not part of their inner circle of the enlightened.\n\nIt sounds pretty dumb if I call Gotye a self-published song, or Another Earth a self-published movie. No, but rather I acknowledge their hard work, low budget, and high talent level, and I commend them for such high quality artistic entertainment. In short, buy this song if you haven't, because it will play endlessly in your head until you subconsciously buy it in your sleep one night anyway.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Kem is a new Motown cat with a distinctive new sound. Well not new just different from most contemporary music today. Essentially he's a jazz singer when you break it down. Listening to his CD is like an extended set of the \"Oasis After Dark\". He released this CD on his own a year ago and after sellin 10,000 copies he managed to get the attention of Motown. Listening to this CD is difficult because while the tone is great and his vocals are good there seems to be something missing. I often found myself asleep before the CD was finished. Kinda like listening to one of those \"Sounds of The Earth\" CD's ... or something to help you go to sleep. 10 distinct songs about love and life. He goes from an Al Jarreau sound on Track 7 \"Brotha Man\" till a Simply Redd feel on Track 3 \"Say\", my favorite track on the CD by the way. Soothing is the best thing I guess you can say about this CD. A nice CD to go to sleep to. Now whether that's a compliment or not I'm not sure. This is definitely not for everyone, but the Jazz Enthusiast will probably be more likely to find use for this CD. \"Is it like Floetry\"? No. They are more hip than this CD. \"Is It like SADE\"? No. She invokes more soul in her music. \"Al Jarreau?\" No. Jarreau is more livelier than this cat. This one still kind puzzles me. My favorite cuts are 3,4,5,and 6.

I like to listen to the Ultimate Lakeside Collection CD and the Bar Kays' Night Cruising CD as well. Mark Wood Jr. is a great soul singer and had some great performances for Lakeside. Well, anyway, this song by Debby Boone still sticks in my head and everything I can remember from radio back in the day I buy :) I also like to listen to thedeependradio.com.

{"text":"This album is an absolute classic from front to back. The first time I heard Husker Du was with Warehouse, and I wasn't intrigued so I didn't listen to the CD again for quite some time. Then out of nowhere I was doing my Amazon vinyl shopping (usually while intoxicated which is never good for the wallet..) and I searched Husker Du out of nowhere and found this album at a good price. Bought it and listened to it immediately upon receiving it in the mail. I was blown away from the second I heard a noise out of my speakers. Loud, noisy, screaming guitar. Fast drums, bass beat to back the drums just enough and lyrics I couldn't understand but eventually caught them \"new day rising\" absolutely simple, yet very effective with the yelling and such. I was so hooked already. It's one of those 40+ minute albums that feels like it goes by in seconds. So I just flipped back to side A and did the repeat. The next day after listening to this I got in my truck headed to work and put in Warehouse because it was the only CD I had by them and as opposed to my first time, now I was in love with what I was hearing again. Since then I'm now a Husker Du fiend. These three guys are amazing. New Day Rising is just gorgeous though because it was the start of their more \"friendly\" and \"pop-ish\" music, but it's still so upfront and intense at the same time. Really groundbreaking stuff. This and Zen Arcade are at a tie for my favorite with Warehouse not far behind. Every album they touched though is just magical. Great group of musicians and such entertaining and fun music to listen to no matter what time. Highly recommended album and group.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Rock 'n' Roll is the seventh studio album by American rock band Buckcherry, released on August 21, 2015. If I were to give my honest and objective opinion about Rock 'n' Roll, I would say that it surely is not Buckcherrys best album; I wouldnt classify this as their worst either, but it leaves quite a bit to be desired.\n\nBuckcherry has been a favorite band of mine since their debut album dropped in 1999. I followed them intently until they disbanded after their Time Bomb album in 2001, but actually felt that they released their strongest material starting with 15 in 2005. I enjoyed most of their album up till Confessions a couple years back, and man, since then they have steadily continued to decline in my eyes. This brings me to their newest effort Rock 'n' Roll, and what I feel they did well, and maybe not so well.\n\nThe most notable thing about this record is that Buckcherry seems to make an effort  albeit a seemingly small effort- to return to their sleaze-rocking past. Songs like The Madness and Bring it Back ooze that sleazy vibe that made these guys stick out, while Sex Appeal has a classic Van Halen vibe that makes it a favorite of mine. The rest of the album is where the problems lay for me: bad songs, horrible song writing, and just too many mid-tempo filler songs. Now when I say filler, I absolutely mean songs that are there simply to take up space and time on an album. Tracks like Wood and Tight Pants seem like they could have been written by my six year old nephew, while a myriad of mellow songs reach a cheese factor that could make 80s hair bands laugh (and 80s hair metal is my favorite music).\n\nThe album is actually not all that terrible when you give it a couple listens. It most assuredly is not 15 or Black Butterfly, and thats fair, but sometimes you have to wonder if that special something that Buckcherry had at one point is now a thing of the past.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"I agree with the reviewer who says he buys every release Rick does... I am the same way, as are most diehard Rick fans.  That said, just because I am a diehard doesnt mean I will like everything Rick does (not saying all diehards blindly love everything he does, but MANY do).  Rick is one of my all time favorite songwriters... I have no reason to be lackluster in any review unless it is how I really feel...\n\nThis is not a bad release.  Unfortunately, its not a good release either.  It's a solid \"ho hum\".  It's main problem is it and its songs is generally boring.  The songs are either slow or most are lacking in emotion.  Most are also very close to the originals in arrangement but a lesser finished product... in the way you hear when some studio band cranks out the top 40 hits \"as performed by ____\" that you used to see for $1.99 at department stores.  For me, it makes me think of the originals and why I like them better.  Broken Wings and Waiting For A Girl Like You are great songs originally... but they sound very similar here and in the case of WFAGLY, it was simply BETTER, with Lou Gramm singing it.  Unfortunately, there is not one cover here that I think is an improvement upon the original... (unlike how Rick made \"I've Done Everything For You\" and a few other covers through his career so much better than their originals).  Few here even get me remotely excited.  Here, the standout covers are Human and Baker Street (which is a lighter more heartfelt version than the one put out a few years ago by Foo Fighters).  The whole album is so lacking in intensity.  I know he intentionally chose songs that are mellow, but I just don't think that was wise and it makes for a release that is easy to file in your collection and forget.  There isn't any cover song except Baker Street that makes me want to hear it again.  Rick is a master of intensity in the right places... Shock Denial Anger Acceptance seemed to reiterate that point both to Rick and to the fans.  Had he done a cover CD with some more rocking tunes mixed in, I think it might have been at least more interesting if not downright good... this one just isn't and I can only hope this hasn't kept him from working on new songs for the next real CD.\n\nThe one gem on this release is Rick's own song Cry, and that alone really makes it worth something to the diehards (in addition to the fact that diehards will buy anything he does anyway).  It is a very good song that is emotional and has some great vocals upon it.  I find it only adds to my wish that Rick would have spent this time recording his own work than doing this!  Unless you have all other Rick albums already, you are better off putting your money into them than this album.  Especially be sure you have Shock Denial Anger Acceptance, Living In Oz, or Working Class Dog before even considering this one... those are Rick at his best.\n\n(Again, this isn't a bad CD... but Rick's real work is so superior and an average release for Rick isn't indicative of his abilities.  I'd hate to see someone buy this as their introduction to Rick and come away thinking he isn't all that good.)","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"\"God of Drum\" is a collection of ten original tribal music pieces inspired by the thunder deities of world mythology. The music was composed and performed by Get Tribal, the artist name of Kari Hohne, who is also a Mayan language preserver, master diver, best-selling author, tablet app designer, dream analyst, business consultant, Tai-Chi instructor, and world traveler - whew!\n\nAncient cultures revered thunder for activating spring each year and used drums to synchronize the heart, mind and soul with the vital life force. It is believed that the pounding of the drum awakens the heart, allowing us to achieve higher states of awareness. The ten tracks on this album are designed to stimulate the seven major Chakras as well as the Dantien, the Soul Star and Spirit Chakras, and the compositions reflect world-wide cultural influences that include Native American, Gaelic, Chinese, Norse, Celtic, African, Middle Eastern, Mayan, and Indian. It's an impressive and stirring album from a world music perspective as well as from a more earthy and sensual enjoyment of the pounding rhythms.\n\n\"God of Drum\" begins with \"Call of Abundance,\" inspired by Wakinyan, the Thunder Bird of the Lakota and one of the many feathered serpents found in indigenous cultures. This piece is mostly drums and chant, with flutes and electronic effects floating a melody over the drum. I love the intensity and energy of \"Passion Rising,\" composed for Loucetious, a Gaelic deity. The powerful drums, chanting voices, and bagpipe-like sounds stimulate the sacral chakra, which can separate fear and anger from the sensation of pleasure. \"Donnar\" the Nordic thunder deity, inspired \"Awakening Power,\" which is very dark, intense and cinematic.  Powerful, hypnotic drumming meshes with wordless vocals, strings and organ to get the pulse pounding and the heart racing - another favorite. \"The Flow of Expression\" is quite different. Inspired by Xango from the Afro-Caribbean region, the piece has a Reggae beat and a chant intended to \"polish the mirror of the mind.\" \"Open to Wonder\" is a haunting and exotic nod to Adad, the storm deity of Mesopotamia. The subtle changes in rhythm are designed to be unexpected in order to make us more receptive to a sense of wonder. \"Aligning With Purpose,\" inspired by the Mayan thunder deity, Chaac, is more orchestrated and cinematic. It is intended to stimulate the Soul Star chakra, which regulates our connection to a sense of purpose and helps us assimilate the wisdom of the higher self or purveyor of dreams. \"Endless Reflection,\" inspired by Indra, the thunder deity of India, contains a mantra that is sung throughout the peace, repeating the words, \"om\" (the sound of the universe) and \"shanti,\" which means peace. The combination of traditional Indian instruments and electronics creates a fascinating juxtaposition that brings the album to a peaceful close.\n\n\"God of Drum\" is a mesmerizing musical exploration of thunder gods throughout history and from all corners of the world. Certain to stir the ears and soul as well as the chakras, Get Tribal has created a unique and inspiring work of musical art (I love the cover artwork, too!). Recommended!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"So much controversy has been generated regarding the creative merrit of this album that I truly believe it's many enjoyable qualities have been forgotton. Not only that but their are many excellent creative elements to this music as well that are even still ignored to this day for the same reason. So instead of concentrating on this album for what it isn't I'll focus this review on what it is. Throughout his career it's important to understand that George Benson was always on the cutting edge of vocal soul-pop\/jazz. Even his earliest albums such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-George-Benson-Cookbook\/dp\/B0012GMW5W\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The George Benson Cookbook<\/a>&nbsp;featured Benson singing pop songs of the day so I am not going to criticize him on this album for doing what he'd always done. The main thing that makes the difference here is that George Benson is modernizing his poppy funk-jazz here for the mid 70's and in terms of music,song selections and just his renowned playing and singing this album certainly takes the cake there. It's not very long in it's entirety but the fairly long cuts that are here are all excellent each in different ways and aside from two one vocal number the instrumentals that dominate this recording give enough time for everyone,especially Benson to strech out instrumentally. No matter how many times I've heard the title song of this album,as far as I know one of only a select few instrumentals associated with Bobby Womack and aside from the rather pretty melody these days I actually really enjoy the bluesy sort of licks gets on the final verses of the song. After having heard the original of \"This Masquerade\" on Leon Russell's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Carney\/dp\/B000002U04\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Carney<\/a>&nbsp;it gives new meaning to this one. Leon's had a deep bayou flavor to it wheras George Bensosn presents the song as something of an American pop standard with the darkness of the melody baught up to the surface even more along with George's guitar-scating signiture almost making the song into a Benson original as opposed to an interpretation. In fact the only Benson original here is the instrumetal \"So This Is Love?\" which,much like \"Lady\" and the Jose Feliciano cover \"Affirmation\" all get a great balance between soul-jazz,funk and R&B with a tempo and rhythm that variates enough to keep it really interesting and involving. \"Six To Four\" is a great pop\/funk that's a bit more uptempo and upbeat than the rest of the album and provides a nice change of pace. This album,all and all is not altogether as pop oriented as you might expect despite Claus Ogerman's flowery string arrangements and the upfront melodies and it actually serves it's purpose very well in that regard. There are plenty of very musical licks from George,Phil Upchurch and everyone else involved in the making of this album so it's not just a commercial triumph for Benson but he didn't totally compromise himself artistically either.","classification":5,"fold":3}

While his past songs like his collaboration with Dobie Gray on the classic Drift Away, the simple breakout single, Follow Me, were good staples, his latest single isn't bad, but could've been a bit different. Smile, Uncle Kracker's the first single from his latest album, Happy hour isn't a bad song to enjoy, but just simply doesn't feel like it is anything different from anything he has made before. It still is better than a lot of the other songs that have been on radio recently that've been more like pop trash. Still, I do wish Uncle Kracker could find a better sound for his next single, because the song is not really enough to smile on for a real happy hour.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"This album sounds very different than most TOP albums, so if you're used to that stickier East Bay Grease they'd develop once hitting the big WB you may have to listen with a different mindset.\nThe sound on this album *IMHO* is a big \"blacker\" a bit more late '60s\/early '70s feeling, and definitely shows their ties to COLD BLOOD, another band DEFINITELY worth checking out.  In many ways tight, but not as tight as they'd come to be, yet they compensate with soul splattering ENERGY.  - - The closest you've probably heard TOP to this \"sound\" is on their BUMP CITY album, when they went back to a dirtier and grittier sound.\nFUNKATEERS will love this album.

{"text":"GOLD is the best anthology of Cream available. It eliminates the trifling \"Wrapping Paper\", which marred THE VERY BEST OF CREAM, and gets straight to \"I Feel Free\", which is the true beginning of the band's incredible legacy. Disc One, which is devoted entirely to studio material, is consistent from soup to nuts, featuring such outstanding songs as \"N.S.U.\", \"Strange Brew\", \"Sunshine Of Your Love\", \"Tales Of Brave Ulysses\", \"White Room\", \"Politician\", and other heavy blues-rock classics which paved the way for the style that is today called heavy metal; the only lighthearted cut on this disc is the annoying \"Anyone For Tennis\", but that's made up for by the twenty other studio cuts here. Disc Two, on the other hand, which is all live material, is more of a mixed bag. Three songs here- \"Crossroads\", \"Sunshine Of Your Love\", and \"I'm So Glad\"- are incredible, but the rest do not hold up as well as the studio songs. Nevertheless, this anthology is a must-own for anyone serious about rock music.","classification":5,"fold":3}

Yet, it is so sad that it has been 35 years since John Lennon was tragically murdered, and the songs that he has recorded on his own, and with The Beatles have stood the test of time deeper than meets the eye.

One of my favorites is Woman, because of its simplicity in saying I love you in just a simple ballad. t truthfully is one of those songs that really takes me into a time where I do wish that John Lennon was still making music, before he died.

{"text":"Prime Cuts:  Whom Shall I Fear (God of Angel Armies), Crown Him (Majesty), Shepherd Boy\n\nWhat is about Chris Tomlin that has made him one of the most influential global worship artists around?  Across the world each Sunday, churches are using the songs of Tomlin such as \"Jesus Messiah,\" \"Our God,\" \"Jesus My Redeemer,\" \"How Great is Our God\" as soundtracks for lifting up the name of Jesus in worship.  Recently, as an indication of Tomlin's international worldwide influence, his hit \"Our God\" was recorded in a quadruple of languages namely Portuguese, Spanish, Russian and Mandarin.  And such a pandemic streak is not about to end any time soon with the release of \"Burning Lights.\" \"Burning Lights,\" Tomlin's eighth solo studio record, is definitely going to continue to even aggrandize this sweeping phenomena.  Central to Tomlin's success is that he is at heart a worshipper of the Almighty God.  As a result via his songs he is able to capture the grandeur of God by building up to anthemic heights of explosive praise yet embracing simple but ear catching riffs that the casual listener could sing-a-long with.  Also, his rich and even-keeled tenor with flourishes of strong emotional intensities (not unlike Matt Redman) is a surplus.  Further, unlike many singer-songwriters who are quite hesitant to share the song crafting pie, Tomlin is humble enough to write and build on the contributions of fellow writers. This time round on this new disc, we find notable writers such as Phil Wickham, Matt Maher, Ed Cash, Matt Redman and the ubiquitous SESAC Christian Songwriter of the Year Jason Ingram co-writing with him.\n\nNever one to rest on his laurels, with \"Burning Lights\" Tomlin continues to provide the church with new and future worship classics.  It is not difficult to see why Christian radio and churches are already warming up to the lead single \"Whom Shall I Fear (God of Angel Armies).\"  The instantaneous appeal of this song is found in the song's emotional transparency.  Tomlin is vulnerable enough to admit that life is tough often plagued by all kinds of fears.  Yet, in the midst of such angst, he challenges us to look towards how God surrounds us with his hordes of his angels.  Such a Godly gaze will dispel our fears that right before the song ends we would already be brimming with praise before God. This is truly what Godly worship is all about. Concurrent with Hillsong's recent single \"Cornerstone\" where a new chorus is strung onto an old hymn, \"Crown Him (Majesty)\" finds Tomlin resurrecting the timeless hymn \"Crown Him with Many Crowns\" tagging onto it a newly written chorus.  Adding to the beauty of this re-constructed hymn is the inclusion of Kari Jobe's vocals on the second verse. And listening to how she soars with Tomlin to the song's majestic climax culminated in the final verse is just heavenly.  With some crisp strumming of just the guitar over the first half of the song, Phil Wickham joins Tomblin on the folky \"Thank You for Saving Me.\"\n\nTomlin not only gives us his usual high-charged pop\/rock worship staples, he also comes with a few surprises.  Though first appeared on Delirious' former lead single Martin Smith's ep, \"God's Great Dance Floor\" gets a Brit-dance makeover.  Starting with just the synth before the brass band breaks out, \"God's Great Dance Floor\" finds Tomlin dancing with charm on this catchy Smith-Tomlin composition.  Stirring too is \"Awake My Soul\"--here Tomlin stretches his musical boundaries to include a hip hop sermonic midsection by rapper Lecrae.  Recalling how the Spirit resurrects the dry bones in Ezekiel's vision, Tomlin calls upon us to be fully alive in Christ.  And no Tomlin would ever be complete with his signature ballads.  Here the ballads are strangely delegated to the second half of the CD (\"Countless Wonder,\" \"Shepherd Boy,\" \"Jesus, Son of God\" and \"Sovereign\").  The best among the quartet is \"Shepherd Boy.\"  With a piano underpinning joined later by a choir and some gorgeous arrays of strings, \"Shepherd Boy\" is prayerful devotional to take what seems to be our insignificant lives and lay it for the Master's use.\n\nImportant to note is that not all the 12 cuts here are new.  In fact, 3 songs here have already appeared in 2012's Passion album (\"White Flag,\" \"Jesus, Son of God\" and \"Lay Me Down\").  Other than \"White Flag,\" they are the weakest inclusions here with \"Lay Me Down\" being a refurbished (and extremely busy) worship number.  Nevertheless, \"Burning Lights\" is certainly a landmark worship album not just in 2013 but in any year.  Songs on this disc are going to be heard endless in churches over numerous languages across the world.  But more importantly, just as Tomlin is a worshipper at heart, these songs will continue to transform us from being lovers of this world to be true worshippers of the Almighty God.","classification":4,"fold":3}
{"text":"There is something unusual about the lead singer's voice and the tempo of this song. Can't tell you what it is...almost as if I'm not expecting that he has the chops to make it through the song (like the range will exceed him), or that the song will just beach itself and run dry without building to anything.\n\nAnd then, before you know it, you're spiralling down through a melody that is very unusual - originally so - which is difficult to find these days. The song makes choices that are not intuitively expected, and it pays off.\n\nIt's a ballad, a love song, a song of loss and warning and experience and bitter truths. It's beautiful, but there is a lot of pain beneath the surface.\n\nAnd it hooks me every time.\n\n(I will confess that I kicked myself the day after downloading it, thinking I had made a terrible mistake.

The Memory ballad is all about the glossy vocals of Estelle. Drawn is literally a Yukimi Nagano song. Lord Intended becomes a Justin Hawkins solo before the halfway point. Its conceptually off-putting, odd even, how many bars go by with featured singers taking the place of the guys whose album this is supposed to be.\n\nIts not like the songs are good enough to get away with it. Most are so-so. The rhapsodic changes of Snoopies; its not this but another song that features Snoop Dogg; is particularly jarring, though its worth mentioning that the Trainwreck beat, while amateurish, is quirky and cute.

{"text":"I thought that \"How to Train Your Dragon\" was everything a mainstream animated film ought to be: funny, beautifully wrought, moving - and this soundtrack complements the mission admirably. I thought so at the time I saw  the film, but forgot to pick up the soundtrack until today when my son was watching the sequence where Hiccup first rides Toothless. Like my favorite soundtracks (think ET), the music and visuals are complementary and each necessary for the other to succeed. As with any soundtrack, there are fundamental themes and lesser ambient pieces. The \"big\"  orchestral sets are marvelous in scope and dynamic range: \"This is Berk\" and \"Test Drive\" for instance. The instrumentation is fascinating and diverse, with thundering percussion and horns a'blaring. Some of it is so stirring and evocative that it could make a grown man weep (Romantic Flight\"). If the music is inconsistent in its heritage, so be it - it is marvelous, joyous, occasionally bombastic, and stands on its own. But as a perfect compliment to a wonderful film, it is superlative. Should have won the Oscar in 2011 as should the movie in 2010.\n\nUpdate: I have listened to this album over and over. It has become a family favorite. My 8 year old son told me, \"I don't know why I love it -it makes me happy and I can see the movie in my head.\" What a complement to Mr. Powell.\nPieces that have grown on me particularly are \"Coming Back Around,\" which nicely pulls together many of the musical themes from the film in a presentation that is touching and rousing. \"Forbidden Friendship\" grows in intensity as the friendship it represents evolves. \"See You Tomorrow\" is a near miraculous dance piece that makes me smile each time.\nI have reservations that they have green lit HTTYD 2 AND 3. Sometimes I wish they would leave well enough alone. I appreciate that this is a series of books, but as a collaboration of music and imagery, it is hard to top this work. We shall see.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"As he showed on \"American Idol,\" David Archuleta's voice is perfectly tailored for inspirational slow song; however, he was criticized by many for singing too many treacly ballads on the show.  Fortunately, his debut single on Jive Records is a very catchy, current-sounding, and age-appropriate up-tempo song.  I enjoyed the song immediately, and it's been added to numerous high profile radio stations.  The digital single also sold well the first week, allowing David to impressively debut on the Billboard Hot 100 at #2 (besting David Cook's first single).  Billboard noted that it was one of the highest debuts by an American Idol contestant of a song that wasn't featured on the show.

{"text":"This beautiful and haunting composition transcends musical boundaries, while reminding us that we ultimately must face our greatest fear - the unkown. Matthew 14: 25 - 31 provides a lyrical backdrop: Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the [Sea of Galilee]. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. Its a ghost, they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: Take courage! It is I. Dont be afraid. Lord, if its you, Peter replied, tell me to come to you on the water.\nCome, he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, Lord, save me! Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. You of little faith, he said, why did you doubt? (NIV). It is this fear of the unkown - the deep, dark waters - that terrrified Peter, and it is this fear of the unknown that we confront as we face our own mortality. We must step out onto the water in faith, having not seen our Lord and Savior, but trusting him with our eternal souls. Hebrews 11:1 reminds us \"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen (KJV). I praise Jesus for this beautiful song that is simultaneously haunting and reassuring.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"From the opening riff of Modzilla, it's clear that Blaster is a solid rock album. Scott's vocals are strong throughout, and the music hits hard with classic rock influences and a modern twist. The band is pretty tight with some excellent guitar work. While the music doesn't quite mesh the same way as STP, this is a quality musical experience all around.\n\nIn a way, this feels like the next logical step after STP's self-titled album. On the whole though, I think this is a stronger effort. In terms of Scott's career, I'd rank this ahead of Scott's solo album Happy in Galoshes, STP self-titled, and Velvet Revolver's Contraband. It's a little weak lyrically at times (Way She Moves, Beach Pop), but there aren't any bad songs on here.\n\nIn terms of the quality of the vinyl pressing: I purchased the clear orange vinyl through the PledgeMusic campaign prior to the album release. It's a good looking record in a quality sleeve with a nice insert (and the bonus sleeve with Scott's autograph was a nice bonus). The pressing itself sounds good for the most part, but there isn't enough dead wax on Side B, so closing track \"Circles\" sounds a bit muddled.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"There's no doubt that TV on the Radio is a special and unique band. With each release they've managed to expand their sound and weave new textures into it, something that Seeds puts on display with expert precision. It's difficult to describe exactly why I love this album so much but right from my first listen I was enthralled. The sound is more direct here, as songs like \"Happy Idiot\", \"Could You\" and \"Right Now\" demonstrate. Then there are the more obtuse and varied songs that the group is known for, with \"Ride\", \"Test Pilot\" and the album's title track being some of the biggest standouts. \"Winter\" is driven by a distorted guitar and \"Trouble\" is driven by acoustic dynamics; they're both drastically different and yet they compliment each other so well. It's difficult to pinpoint any weak spots on the record and with each spin I find myself drawn in deeper.\n\nSome may be turned off by the more accessible sound but it fits the band well and you can tell it's a natural evolution for this great group. Seeds is a joyful and moving experience that covers so many emotions without ever overwhelming you. I really can't recommend it enough and it just be my favorite album of theirs to date. Simply outstanding.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"This follow-up to the sublime Powerslave is rather weak. Part of the problem is the new sound they are using. The compositions themselves are obviously in the tradition of Iron Maiden but they come off sounding very flat compared to other Maiden discs. Sounds more like prog rock than straight heavy metal.\nThe best part of this disc is the superb lead guitar work by Dave Murray and Adrian Smith. They really play with a lot of feel. The solos are fast in the tradition of good metal but also melodic.\nThe worst part of the disc is Bruce's vocals and some of the lyrics. Bruce is trying to sound operatic on some of the songs and he is just not up to the task. Sometimes he sounds like a howling old lady.\nSome of the lyrics take a stab at being deep but come across as just silly - Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner being the main culprit. Alexander the Great was an attempt at doing another Rime of the Ancient Mariner. The Rime, adapted from Samual Taylor Coleridge (sp?), is a piece of epic metal genius. Alexander the Great sounds like Bruce is reading the lyrics out of a high school text book on European History. Simply foolish.\nTo sum up, the approach here is obviously similar to Powerslave but the results do not even compare. Somewhere in Time is one of Maiden's weakest.","classification":2,"fold":3}

{"text":"Growing up in Philadelphia, with the Jersey shore just around one corner, New York City around another, and more AM radio stations than you could count, pretty much means that Ive spent my entire life with Dion.  And while his early material had a dynamic beat, and was super cool for dancing to on American Bandstand, as I grew older, there wasn't much honesty, or anything profound to be derived in those 45 record grooves.\n\nAnd then came a new century, and with it, came new Dion, a more bluesy, more rootsy Dion, one whos songs came from the heart, whos songs where part of a more real and inclusive American landscape.  It seemed that when he laid out a new version of Turn Me Loose for the Till The Night Be Gone: A Tribute To Doc Pomus that something in him was awakened, then followed King Of New York, along with New Masters, a collection or his reworked classics, the smoldering Bronx In Blue, his brilliant Son Of Skip James[which I can not praise enough], the infectious Tank Full Of Blues, and here with New York Is My Home, Dion has delivered a new collection of material that is not only first rate, but undeniably so.  All of this has caused me to dig out my dusty 45s to see if I could filter out an essence hidden there, to make the connection with what once was, and what has since been flowing from my stereo ... and with a mile wide smile sliding across my face, I discovered that I could, that the real Dion was hidden between those grooves, just waiting for the right time, and perhaps the right audience, to lay waste to the world yet again.\n\nThere are no pretenses to be found on New York Is My Home, just sensationally rendered material laced with bluesy hooks, lyrics that relay time honored stories, and visionary instrumentation that draws from the past, though creating a profound sound that exists very much in the present, and swaggers with all youd expect from perhaps the true godfather of rock n roll.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"The Secret Sisters, in real life siblings Lydia and Laura Rogers out of Alabama, seemingly came out of nowhere some 3-4 years ago with their stunning self-titled debut album, receiving much critical acclaim. It was as if the album was transposed from a different era. Now finally comes the much-anticipated follow-up album.\n\n\"Put Your Needle Down\" (12 tracks; 44 min.) continues to explore the vocal interplay between Lydia and Laura. The album opens with a nice \"Rattle My Bones\", and then shifts to \"Iuka\", a beautiful reflective tune. \"Dirty Lie\" is layered with strings. \"The Pocket Knife\" is a showcase for the sisters' dual lead vocals. The first half of the album closes with the wistful \"Black And Blue\". The nostalgia vibe continues with \"Lonely Island\", which I could've sworn is an Everly Brothers song, except that it isn't. \"I Cannot Find a Way\" is a more country-leaning song. \"Good Luck, Goodnight, Goodbye\" sounds it would be the perfect album closer (and in fact it is a terrific tune), but it is not. That honor goes to \"River Jordan\", which is a little strange. But it's a very minor quibble. As was the case with the debut album, the new album is produced by uber-producer T-Bone Burnett. By now the girls are sounding ever more confident and, as a result, \"Put Your Needle Down\" is for me a stronger album that their debut album.\n\nI haven't had the opportunity yet to see the Secret Sisters in concert. I can only hope they will take to the road in a massive way to support this album, and with a little luck I'll get to see them here in Cincinnati at some point. Meanwhile, \"Put Your Needle Down\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":3}

Mainstream promotes promiscuous sex and that leads to damaged hearts... part \"B\" is Bizzle's \"Tomorrow\" which decsribes for some of us the morning after and the associated regrets...\n\n\"Meet My Savior\" is the similar flavor to Gideonz Army's \"Come As U R\" aka hip-hop invitational music.\n\nTo be honest most of these tracks are really good, and Bizzle is a Top 6 MC for me.\n\nPS\nMuch love to Sho Baraka, I appreciate and recognize what you were doing with 10th.

{"text":"'The Soul Purpose' was an exceptionally good release from 7L & Eso that was really unfairly hated upon.  It was a 20 track CD filled with a lot of good songs (\"Speaking Real Words\" \"Jealous Over Nothing\", accompanied by some average tracks (\"You Know The Concept\" \"Mic Mastery\"), and a few that didn't come all that well (\"Guestlist\")...  It probably was hated upon because of Eso's previous cyborg-android scientific type of material switched over to a cocky arrogant battler with simpler rhyming schemes.\nWhere ever there were mistakes on 'The Soul Purpose', 'Dangerous Connection' not only corrects them, but PERFECTS everything on the album!  Every single track is banging on this album!!  7L's mediocre production has improved exponentially and Esoteric's flow just compliments the beats even more.  Plus if you felt that there was too much battle type of material on the last album, 'Dangerous Connection' comes with a bunch of good conceptual songs...\n\"Terrorist's Cell\" - first off ANYTHING produced by Stoupe (jedi mind tricks) will have an off the wall type of beat.  Esoteric's lyrics explain the mind of a 9\/11 terrorist going through with his crusade... but after finally seeing his wrongdoing it's too late... This is not only a controversial song, but it is executed INCREDIBLY well (the re-play button will be on this for a few times)...\n\"Word Association\" - another creative track where Esoteric raps about being a psychotic patient rapping 'word association' with a doctor.  A very humorous track...\n\"Stalker\" - a hilarious tale about a guy who stalks teenage girls that he has fantasies of... this runs along the same type of humor \"Jealous over Nothing\" had...\n\"Herb\" - along with teenyboppers and Nelly fans, herbs are something else I detest.  Esoteric arrogantly defines the term herb all throughout the track ...\n\"Rest In Peace\" - a clever concept song where Eso rhymes about himself passing on and how his music ALL OF A SUDDEN is known, and how there are album profit problems among his family and friends...\nAnd the rest of the tracks are the usual Esoteric battle\/android type of material... NOTHING on this material is WEAK by any means (there are no blunders like Guestlist)...  The ONLY thing that annoyed me about this CD is that it was kinda short in comparison with Soul Purpose.

The success of \"Believe\" directed this album to this music style.  To start things up the leading US single \"Song For The Lonely\" is an anthem dedicated to the people of NYC or anyone who ever felt lonely, the lyrcis on this song are really strong, but, the strong resemblence to \"Believe\" make this song sound a little bit dated.  The second single in the US \"A Different Kind Of LOve Song\" is another strong lyric song, with great definition, and more innovative beats than the first, one of the best tracks of the album.  \"Alive Again\" tranceable, cheesy lyrics, but understandable, the second single overseas, not a great result.  \"The Music's Not Good Without You\" this is the first single overseas, has an old feeling to it, dedicated secretly to Sonny, great deep lyrics, sad sounding, melancolic, great results, \"Rain Rain\", the more midtempo of the album, great feelin' put in this, \"Real Love\" the distortion of Cher's voice is overused here, not bad, but not great. \"Love So High\" filler, but it's listeneable, \"Body To Body, Heart...\" similar to Dove D LAmore, so you can tell, \"Love One Another\" cover of Amber's original song, this album do have strong message, and great beat, could easily be taken into your mind. \"When The Money's Gone\" well, last single release, great dance tune, but the message is a little anoying.

{"text":"I am typically not a fan of 'Tower Of Power', but this song struck me when it first came out in summer of 1973. I had gotten divorced earlier during that year. Then there came that mid-summer romance. When I told her that now, as I was single again, I would finally complete my patriotic chores and that I would most likely be sent to someplace in Europe, she gave me that funny look, babbling something like me quitting that good job I had and that she would never want to see me again. Oh well. I survived. This song stuck with me. I still like it a lot.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"This song starts with some very melancholy piano soon joined by a plaintive, but completely complimentary vocal. The lyrics are mysterious but appropriate for the mood of the piece. It is a very minimal tune with some flute and strings joining in at around 2 minutes. Very non-intrusive bells join in at 2 minutes 15 seconds. This is a simple but powerfully moody and evocative song that I loved the first time I heard it.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Another good but inconsistent album by Parquet Courts that leaves me a bit frustrated. There are times when this band sounds great, like a top notch outfit, but at other times, they slip into mediocrity and frustrate me.\n\nMost of the other reviews give you a good gist of what this band sounds like. You can hear plenty of Velvet Underground influence, a bit of Pavement, and I also hear a healthy dose of old Dream Syndicate in some songs. Obviously, those are some very good influences. But Parquet Courts also have this maddening tendency to talk-rap in some of the songs, as if they are just too lazy to actually sing the song. The lead singer has a decent enough voice, so I don't know why they do this so often. Other than those infrequent musical hiccups, there are some powerful, riveting songs on this latest effort. I'm just waiting for this band to really show what they are capable of and give us a truly great album. This isn't quite the one.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Written by Xtina and producer Scott Storch, Fighter is a rock track dedicated to all of the backstabbers and naysayers who ever put the diva down with vicious remarks. Rather than simply lashing out in anger, she thanks them for their failed attempts. \"After all that you put me through\/You think I'd despise you\/But in the end I wanna thank you\/Cuz you've made me that much stronger!\"\n\nA big \"thank you\" to the so called friends who \"were there by my side\/Always down for the ride\" until \"your joy ride just came down in flames\/Cuz your greed sold me out in shame.\" All of the pain led to her to realize that it \"made me learn a little bit faster\/Made my skin a little bit thicker\/Makes me that much smarter\/So thanks for making me a fighter!\n\nThe middle of the song allegedly addresses Christina's former manager Steve Kurtz: \"How could this man I thought I knew\/Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?\/Could only see the good in you\/Pretended not to know the truth\/You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself\/Through living in denial\/But in the end you'll see YOU-WONT-STOP-ME!\"\n\nThe video is gothic and artsy with Aguilera being held down in a glass box until she breaks free and drives the theme of survival home. It also debuted her spicy black hair look. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you threaten to wallow in self-pity, listen to this song and get your armor on. \"So thanks for making me a fighter!\"","classification":5,"fold":3}

The previous versions are better. This also includes Track 56, which is not pianist James Frisken but is indeed flutist Paula Robison and Kenneth Cooper on harpsichord. The same also goes for some of the Vivaldi tracks.\n\nThe Andras Schiff tracks are also chopped repeats, but at least they aren't mislabeled.","classification":5,"fold":3}

This is an amazing song for her and I fell in love with it the first day I saw her perform it on the Wendy Williams Show,months ago. It was #1 for awhile on Itunes and well deserved.

To me, this is an \"uptown\" album with backup singers who often echo what Hank has just sung.  I don't recall backup like this on his classic albums like \"Old Habits.\"  I particularly liked \"God and Guns\" and \"Those Days Are Gone.\"  The former is most relevant today with gun control and religious issues in the news (you know Hank's position) and the latter laments the relative absence of tradition like Haggard and Jones in today's \"country\" music.  I really don't like the backup singing or the lack of slower more emotional songs like \"Old Habits\" and \"Outlaw Women.\"  I guess I just prefer ol' Hank of the eighties.\n\nraditional country music","classification":4,"fold":3}

The song which is a cover of a old Gloria Jones song, still is a one of a kind joy to listen to.

{"text":"This bargain download collection from Vox is a terrific value, not just because of the price (currently 99 cents), but because the quality of the performances and recordings is very good.\n\nIn my mind, this is a great example of how these downloads bring really exceptional music value, because while these Slatkin recordings may have largely fallen off the radar screen of the music guides and reviewers, there is absolutely nothing wrong with them. I don't care in the least that my 2008 Penguin Guide omits mention of these recordings, instead favoring (mostly) more recent performances from a variety of artists. The world of classical music extends far beyond the ability of any Penguin or other guide to cover, that is something I am sure of.\n\nThese recordings were made in the late 1970's, when Leonard Slatkin was in his early to mid 30's (!) and just establishing himself as a very capable conductor. Slatkin later recorded Rachmaninoff's symphonies again with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra (available on Naxos CDs), but these earlier recordings with the St. Louis Symphony remain just as enjoyable as ever. ClassicsToday, in their review of one of those newer Slatkin\/DSO recordings did mention these earlier performances, commented that \"Leonard Slatkin's Vox Rachmaninov cycle was one of his most successful early series of recordings, and he still has the measure of this music\", and later said that \"As with this team's previous version of the Second Symphony, these performances are solid winners that will reward repeated listening.\"\n\nAnd in fact, the original ClassicsToday review of the symphonies on Vox CD, by Victor Carr Jr., said \"This set testifies to Leonard Slatkin's fabled flair for Russian symphonic music - Rachmaninov in particular. His warmly romantic approach emphasizes the music's lush textures, fluid phrasing, and vivid orchestral coloring, while pointing up the unique stylistic qualities that differentiate the three symphonies. Slatkin heightens the drama of Symphony No. 1 by adding extra percussion to the fiery first movement, while his highlighting of the woodwinds (especially the piccolo) in the finale reveals the influence of Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade on the young Rachmaninov. In No. 2 Slatkin shies away from the intense passion and free rubato of Temirkanov on EMI, but his smoothly flowing reading nevertheless takes on a grand sweep and generates great feeling in the first- and third-movement climaxes. Slatkin's light and energetic approach to No. 3 underlines the work's magical sense of new within the old while reveling in its glittering orchestration - all vividly rendered by the St. Louis Symphony, which provides finely honed and animated playing throughout the set. Vox's minimally miked, naturally balanced recordings show their age only in the slightly rolled-off top end. While similar sets by Ashkenazy (better recorded, featuring a powerfully dramatic No. 1) and Maazel (a stunningly played No. 2) are more compelling overall, Slatkin's makes for a highly recommendable budget-priced alternative.\"(date of review not known).\n\nAnd so, here is an opportunity to get a fine collection of Sergei Rachmaninoff's orchestral music - the symphonies, piano concertos, and orchestral works - complete, with the only exception that I can find being the Suite in D minor, which according to wiki was \"considered lost until the manuscript was found in 2002\", thus its omission from this collection of recordings made between 1975 and 1980.\n\nAltogether there are 42 tracks, 8 hrs of music, equivalent to 7 CD's. Excellent performances and recording sound quality. For someone new to Rachmaninoff, this is a very low risk way to experience his orchestral music. For someone familiar with Rachmaninoff, this is a very low cost supplement to a collection, and the opportunity to enjoy different interpretations of this great music.\n\nPlease note below my correction to the labeling of track 40, if downloading this music and storing it in iTunes or a similar program, so that you can correct the labeling of the track and have it identified correctly.\n\ntracks ...... music\n\n1-11: Symphonies Nos. 1-3 -- Leonard Slatkin conducting the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra.

{"text":"One of the main features I've noticed about neo soul pretty much since I first heard the term is the music's strong association with atmosphere over song craft. You'd have the soft electric pianos,the vinyl scratch effect and all of that. But primarily the rest of the music would be assembled primarily in some variation of a contemporary hip-hip fashion. And that was essentially the function of the music so it seemed: to present a retro sounding flavor inside a basically modern musical context. At first it came off as a gimmicky concept to a degree but some of the people involved in it were extremely talented individuals with a lot of creative potential. When Dwele emmerged he was coming out amid a group of other like minded artists such as Musiq Soulchild and Glenn Lewis to name just a couple others. I never did really explore heavily into what he had to offer that was different. And while I did rather enjoy his first two albums,which I also reviewed here,I still wasn't exactly wowed by Dwele's musical development and conceptualization. It wasn't until I heard this,his fifth album did I start to see a major change in his basic approach.\n\n  The hallmarks of this album is that musically Dwele uses the same type of musical techniques often used to create highly cliched hip-hop\/R&B style chants and sound effects and uses them as a production element along with the live instrumentation here to create a sleek futurist soul\/funk sound that appreciates it's roots as well. \"Going Leaving\",\"Takes22tango\",\"What You Gotta Do\" and \"What Profit\",with their rich multi tracked vocal harmonies and layered electronics are fine examples. However when it comes to the more overtly uptempo tracks \"This Love\",\"Special\" and \"Love Triangle\" that combination of sonically powerful keyboards and rhythms in and around that make for some of the most dynamic and strong sophisticated electronic soul\/funk made during this era. They definitely have a post disco funk flavor about them in every sense of the word,but the instrumental sounds are totally up to date. \"Obey\",\"Must Be\",the only song here with a guest rap along with \"Swank\" and \"Patrick Donald\" both go into suite like R.Kelly\/Isaac Hayes territory that advance a loose concept surrounding the latter part of the album. But they still utilize the same elements that make this music strong,only in a more cinematic sense.\n\n  If someone were to have asked me one of the main minus points I had with neo soul over the years was the fact that it's energy was often very artist dependent. It came off as a music that could very easily lack vitality. While the comments on my other reviews here have stated that this opinion is controversial and not shared by everyone,one need only to listen to an album by Chic followed by an album by Mint Condition,both of whom are live musician oriented and see for yourself who stacks up more in terms of the vitality of their music. It's no reflection on the talent of either band. It's the energy level. Not only on here does Dwele deliver an extremely high level of musical expression,groove and soul but does so with a dynamic level of vitality that makes everything he's trying to do work even better than maybe it was intended to in the first place. Also important is how well this stands as both a collection of separate songs and as a genuine album. Though his album oriented sound might make Dwele a bit difficult in terms of a best of compilation in his future,one of his best qualities is that he IS able to function as an album concept. At any rate this is a very creatively impressive album from Dwele and finds him in an excellent place musically in terms of his intention.","classification":5,"fold":3}

That has been the case already with the passing of their voice, Lemmy Kilmester, whom died back in late 2015 after having a sever battle with cancer. But that isn't alone just in regards to the passing of Lemmy. Sadly, the last surviving member of the original lineup of Motorhead has passed away. With the death of \"Fast\" Eddie Clark, it is a sad and heartbreaking reminder of what really great hard core rock music really was. Motorhead has had so many albums that drove in regards to Rock Music, but out of all of the songs and albums they have made in the world, Motorhead has had only one opus that really has withstood the test of time, with the release of Ace Of Spades. The song is just a fast and fierce anthem that really could rival with other 80's rock anthems like Pour Some Sugar On Me from Def Leppard & AC\/DC's opus Back In Black. In any regards, if you have loved this song because of the legacy Motorhead had with Lemmy, you'll honor it for \"Fast\" Eddie Clark As Well.\n\nFast Eddie Clark: 1950-2018\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"In the world of cookie cutter music nowadays where one group sounds a lot like another group that sounds a lot like another group that sounds like and on and on you will occasionally come across a group that seeks it own style of music. Suddenly the bland sameness of todays top 40 music is shattered by someone who defies having their music locked into a pigeon hole. They are not looking to follow the trend but create a new one that separates them from the rest. One such current group that is looking to do that is Alabama Shakes.\n\nA relatively new group, their current album \"Sound And Color\" is their second offering, Alabama Shakes are certainly shaking things up with their unique sound and color to their music. You really can't quite classify what their genre of music is. It is certainly classic style of rock but there is also some progressive rock to it as well. Then they throw into the mix some blues and country. I can even hear a tinge of jazz in the mix. Their songs on this album can go from wild and loud on one number to soft and soulful the next. They cover all the range of emotions here and cover it well. If you never heard the music of Alabama Shakes before this record will keep you on your toes. When the first song is done playing you may well say \"Ok I know what this group is about\". Then the second song will play. Then you will start re-thinking your first assessment. It will go on song after song til when it's over you won't be sure what you heard except that you liked it. From the soulful \"Don't Wanna Fight\" to the pleading cries of \"Gimme All Your Love\" to the rocking \"Shoegaze\" and all the rest on here. If you find todays cookie cutter style of music bland and boring then listen to \"Sound And Color\" instead. It will restore faith to you that there are still musicians out there who believe in being creative and different rather then playing it safe in following along with whatever the current trend in music is at that moment.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I am going to come right out and say it.  I love this CD.  In fact this is probably one of the best new blues releases I have heard in the past several years.  I first heard about Samantha when she was playing a local blues show in my home town.  I got on youtube and checked out some of her stuff.  It was impressive, but I was not compelled to go see her live or pick up the album.  After she played the show I heard nothing but rave reviews from people I know who went to the show, so I decided to give the album a try.  I am glad I did, Fish is a very talented young lady.  She is a more than competent guitarist and her voice is outstanding.  The fact that she wrote the majority of the tracks on this album is also impressive, as she has proven to be a very strong writer as well.  To my ears there is not a weak track on this disc.  The album is quite wide in scope as well.  Samantha tackles traditional blues, but also forays into rock, country (a truly incredible cover of Tom Petty's \"Louisiana Rain\"), and ending with a torch song, \"Feeling Alright\" that oozes a sticky late night lounge feel.  The Ruf label is the home of today's hottest young blues talent and Samantha Fish has come right out of the gate as one of the best on the label.  There are several songs here that if given the exposure could be radio hits in my opinion and this is a girl who has a very bright future in front of her.  For me this is one of the top blues albums of 2011, and I am looking forward to seeing what this girl does next.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"If there is honestly one thing that I do love about Adele, is that out of all the female singers out there like Rihanna or Beyonce' Knowles, Adele is one of the very few songstresses that isn't severely overexposed, and not annoying. In fact, she has shown for the past several years that when she does come out with new music, it explodes when it comes out. Not only are the songs good, like Rolling In The Deep or Hello, but they are worth listening to over and over again, because she isn't a product for her own voice, she is a real songstress at heart. Her latest single from 25, Send My Love (To Your New Lover) is actually a very upbeat song and sincerely soulful from the heart. I like the song a lot, and it really is just as rhythmic as what Lorde had a few years ago with Royals. It really is a good song that really is a departure from her earlier songs like Set Fire To The Rain, and shows her in a more upbeat rhythm, but it does not weigh Adele's voice down. In fact, it really is worth listening to. If you love Adele, than this song is worth downloading.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"I am truly devastated to hear the news that the great Natalie Cole passed away at 65 years old. He work as a amazing songstress has been delivered through the heartache, and from the soul of following in the footsteps of her beloved father, the great Nat King Cole. I am definitely crushed as a hard core fan of Natalie's. Her voice defiinitely ranged from the sassy in soul and R&B, to the sophisticated Jazz intimacy of her beloved father's legacy. While she had her demons from drug abuse, and the heartbreaks of three failed marriages, what Ms. Cole did for a lifetime, was truly beyond breathtaking at soul. Obviously her biggest hit was really with her beloved father, Unforgettable. The song really showed a beauty and closeness to what Natalie had never experienced with Nat King Coke, and his heartbreaking death. Now with Ms. Cole passing on, the song is so surreal at the soul. I am just shedding tears of sadness for her. Natalie Cole was truly unforgettable.\n\nNatalie Cole  1950-2015\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"You know, I've been a fan of Cyndi Lauper's music since I first saw \"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\" on MTV back in 1983. I have consistently bought all of her albums, even 2001's hard-to-find, Japanes only release, \"Shine\". In fact, I believe it was with that album the Cyndi sort of lost her way. That album was supposed to be released in America, but it never happened, and instead we got and EP titled \"Shine\". After that, Cyndi decided to switch it up a bit by doing a standards album in 2003, a reinterpretation of her own music in 2005, a new electronic album in 2008, and a blues album in 2010. \"Detour\" is her first album in six years, and this time she goes country.\n\nI think of all of her cover albums I like \"Detour\" the best. Classic country music from the 1940's, 1950's, and 1960's, suits her personality and vocal style very well. Not all of the covers hit home, but many of them are well done. Of course, it helps that I am not familiar with most of the originals!\n\nThe best tracks here are \"Funnel Of Love\", \"Detour\", \"Heartaches By The Number\", \"You're The Reason Our Kids Are Ugly\", \"I Want To Be A Cowboy's Sweetheart\" and \"Hard Candy Christmas\".\n\nOf course, I believe that Cyndi should have just stuck to her guns and kept making music her way, and 2008's \"Bring Ya To The Brink\" was a gift. I just wish she'd do more of that, rather than pump out cover albums. In fact, what I'd really like to see, if it's at all possible, is for Cyndi to use the same musicians and producers used for \"She's So Unusual\" for a sequel--maybe, \"She's So Normal\"? I just miss how good she was at songs like \"Time After Time\", \"All Through The Night\", \"True Colors\", \"Change Of Heart\", \"I Drove All Night\", \"Sally's Pigeon's\", \"Come On Home\", \"Shine\", etc. In fact, when was the last time Cyndi did a really good ballad? Years.\n\nAnyway, here's how \"Detour\" compares to Cyndi's other works:\n\n1980 Blue Angel: Two Stars\n1983 She's So Unusual: Five Stars\n1986 True Colors: Five Stars\n1989 A Night To Remember: Three and a Half Stars\n1993 Hat Full Of Stars: Five Stars\n1996 Sisters Of Avalon: Four Stars\n2001 Shine (full Japanese import): Three and a Half Stars\n2003 At Last: One Star\n2005 The Body Acoustic: Three Stars\n2008 Bring Ya To The Brink: Four Stars\n2010 Memphis Blues: Four Stars\n2016 Detour: Four Stars","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Robot Rock at its finest. Im not paying it a compliment, though. Pagans in Vegas, the Toronto-based synth-pop-rock quartet lead by Broken Social Scene Alumna Emily Haynes, have released their sixth full-length album this week to much hurrah and hoopla. Its always hard to review an album by one of your favorite bands where you just don't feel the excitement and good energy that they once gave you. Sadly, after giving this album a few listens, I went reaching for Fantasies (2009) and Synthetica (2012), Pagans far-superior predecessors.\nWhile hearing Pagans in Vegas, I did find the opening track Lie, Lie, Lie to be a solid intro. Haynes trademark vocals (which is the highlight of all Metric albums) come off sweet yet venomous, as do they with Fortunes. By the time we arrive at The Shade, I feel as though Im walking through a video arcade from hell. On Shade, which features tremendous songwriting and solid hooks, Im distracted by the continuous Donkey Kong-like tones throughout the track. Luckily, the acoustic bonus track was included on my copy, which makes this song much more enjoyable for me. Celebrate is standout track for me as the flow between Haynes and her band mates is undeniably fluid.\n\nWhere it begins to take a downturn for me is on Cascades. Not a bad track, but the band begins to sound slick and anodyne. I start hearing other bands in the musicbands that Metric inspired and laid the template for, not the other way around. Rather than recognizing hints of Depeche Mode and Lou Reed, I hear heavy-handed lifts of CHVRCHES and Shiny Toy Guns, as evident on songs such as The Other Side and Too Bad, So Sad (possibly the most annoying song on the album.) Its the inconsistency that bothers me the most about this album. Something about it lacks focusit just falls all over the place, whereas their previous two albums were solid with laser sharp focus. I don't think Pagans in Vegas knows what it wants to be. Especially when one listeners to the self-indulgent two-part epic closer The Face Part one and two. By the end of the album, Im left wondering did the entire band even perform their instruments on this album, or did they simply rely on synths? Im hard pressed to hear any guitars or bass with any level of significance.\n\nThe album isn't a total wash in my mind. Its just not my favorite offering from the band. While there are moments of brilliance on the album, Im disappointed that the amount of songs that grab me only add up to an e.p.s worth of material.","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"Ted Poley's work has long been under-appreciated, including his best known material with Danger Danger, as well as his work with Melodica and his two previous solo albums. On this 2016 solo effort, he teams up with some of the powerhouses of Frontier Records and produces what may be his best overall collective work. Any fan of Danger Danger and Melodica should pick this up immediately. His vocals are spot-on as usual, and the guitar work from Mario Percudani is stellar. The production from Alessandro Del Vecchio is also top-notch. What puts this album over the top, however, is the songwriting. \"Everything we Are\" and \"Stars\" are my favorites personally, but out of the 11 songs, 9 or ten are excellent. This album is just full of great AOR anthems - an absolute MUST HAVE for fans of this genre. I always buy the physical copies of albums from Frontiers and AOR Heaven, to support the artists that I enjoy so much. Ted really brings it all to the table here, and the team he has assembled is an all-star cast to boot.

And until this album the only music I'd digested from him came from the recent EP&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Freaking-Out\/dp\/B005DLBLIQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Freaking Out<\/a>,which was based heavily in 80's boogie funk. Obviously I don't know this man personally. But there's something in his entire musical approach that speaks of him having a musical history and outlook not exactly unlike my own. Of course my interest in him has no basis in narcissism either. It's always a positive experience to hear someone relatively new the music scene expand upon something that has held a high degree of appeal to the listener. And it's all the better when that particular level of expansion extends on the music the artist themselves have been doing as well.\n\n  Right away there are two songs here that leap out of this record for me. \"Say That\" and \"Never Matter\" are both built on lively and complex boogie funk\/electro style explore the melodic craft of the songs as well as the instrumentation-both of personal stand outs. \"Harm In Changing\",\"Rose Quartz\",\"Studies\" and even the somewhat more contemporary production of \"Cake\" all emphasize a number of different types of dance\/techno-disco styles hybridizing with a mix of hauntingly chorded keyboard based melodies.  \"Touch\",\"Cola\",\"High Living\",\"Grown Up Calls\" and \"How It's Wrong\" slow down the pace a bit for what are at their core more probing and harder grooving jazz-funk number.\n\n  During the past few years,different kinds of funk grooves played by different people have began to again become ascendant. And even gain a bit more respect. Such ventures are all the more potent when new directions in the music are explored. And that's what Toro Y Moi does with this: a dance\/funk album to the core. He explores rhythmic and instrumental ideas both old and new-from 70's disco and jazz\/funk fusion to late 80's house and even some 90's retro funk revival along with a combination modern electronic loops and retro synthesizers all constructed together in a very unexpected but organic manner. I appreciate what he and a number of \"nu funk\" (as I call it) artists are doing. Even if others seem to have so many other names to describe their music. In any sense this album is always in step and deep in the groove.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"This is the album that made George Benson a pop superstar. \"This Masquerade\" was a light jazz easy listening hit and \"Breezin\" was a hit too. \"This Masquerade\" had the unique distinction of hitting number one on the jazz, R&B, and pop charts; I wonder if any other tune has performed that trifecta. Jazz players will be very familiar with this tune and having the original version for library was the main reason I picked up a bargain version of the album. I did not realize, however, that the new remastered version has extra versions of some of the tracks as well as a version of \"Down Here On the Ground\" a very Donny Hathawayesque tune that I dig off of the \"Weekend In LA\" album.\n\"Breezin\" sounds like easy listening light jazz but it's a pleasing chart that I enjoy with its flute hook but it's got a nice groove to it as well and . This stuff drips with 70s production values and has a Bob James kind of sound. If you like that kind of light jazz than \"Breezin\" is an excellent album. I find it to be pleasing light jazz that doesn't wear as well as his \"Weekend In LA\" album, where the live performance brings out more fire for George Benson. This album was one of the blueprints for smooth jazz and folks that dig smooth jazz would be wise to look at Benson, with his soulful jazz chops and breathtaking Hathaway like voice before they dig into the latest thing playing on light jazz radio.\n3.5 stars","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"Upon its release in 1981, this band's debut (and with this line-up, only) album quickly found itself dwarfed by the iconic track, \"Tell That Girl to Shut Up.\" A decade later, when the song was turned into a hit by Transvision Vamp, the album from which it originally sprung (and the band that originally sprang it) receded yet another step from public renown. Things weren't helped by Virgin's reluctance to reissue the album on CD, nor the time-limited nature of this Wounded Bird's release. The hard-luck story leaves this great power-pop album once again difficult to find.\n\nAnd rest assured, this is no one-hit wonder of an LP; Holly Beth Vincent's other songs were in the same league as \"Tell That Girl,\" and veteran producer Richard Gottehrer (Blondie, Go-Gos, Richard Hell & The Voidoids) deftly mated the verve of new wave and punk with the timeless sound of guitar-driven rock 'n' roll. Vincent's music is in a league with The Waitresses, Go-Go's and Pearl Harbor & The Explosions, but without the New Wave affectations that prematurely aged the competition's work. Think of this as a sharper-edged version of Bonnie Hayes & The Wild Combo's \"Good Clean Fun.\"\n\nWounded Bird's reissue includes the original front and back covers and song lyrics for the album's original ten tracks. Four bonus cuts include the single edit of \"Miles Away\" and its B-side \"It's Only Me,\" along with two additional B-sides, the acidic \"Fanzine\" and the Ronnie Spector-styled \"Poster Boy.\" MIA from this disc are the pre-LP 7\" version of \"Tell That Girl to Shut Up\" and its B-side \"Chapel of Love,\" which were disappointingly include on the CD reissued of Holly Beth Vincent's confusingly-titled follow-up solo LP, \"Holly and the Italians.\"\n\nThis is worth searching for on the secondary market, as it's one of the best power-pop-punk albums to come out in the early '80s.

While she has had the most success from her American Idol days a decade ago, she has had a few songs that don't really show a drive in the ballad. Her latest song Dark Side, the third song from her latest album Stronger, isn't actually as driven as a the songs she had done before. The chorus of the song feels a bit oversung from Kelly, and not as driven from the voice alone. I really didn't find the song to be all of Kelly as she showed before. Maybe, when Kelly Clarkson comes out with new music soon, something will come along to a brighter side.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":3}

Lead singer Luke Reynolds has an expressive moan in his voice that communicates longing, sadness and desire.  The great weakness of the disc is that the tracks blend facelessly into each other without any jumping out as truly memorable.  Their sound is impressionistic with emphasis on atmosphere and mood, a wonderful rainy day disc.  \"Every Ship Must Sail Away\" is a good example of the aching groove in which the band revels, \"Cause years pass & people change; the bluest skies can turn to grey.\"  \"Boxcar Racer\" has a nice jazz groove and a distinguishable melody & is one of the better tracks.  \"Either Way It Goes\" also gets a bit of energy, \"I didn't mean to let you down, but sometimes even angels hit the ground.\"  Ultimately, Blue Merle show promise and have a nice sound, but now they need to hone their songwriting skills to make tracks that stick in the memory.

{"text":"I've always felt that Sibelius' music, like Mahler's, is less like music than it's like nature coming alive, with each instrument one voice joining with others to tell a story, Sibelius even more so than Mahler, though, more fundamental, more primitive. This set achieves that, in spades.\nYou know what a great orchestra performing a beautiful piece of music sounds like, yes? This set of Sibelius doesn't, to me, sound like that at all. No, it's more like sound rising up like mist from the ground and swirls around you as you walk through it. As if the music just appears and unfolds of its own volition, with no human involvement.\nLemminkainen, for example: one reviewer feels Lemminkainen in Tuolena is too slow, while another says the suite pales in comparison with the old Ormandy recording. I grew up with the Ormandy and I love it: it's an amazing, beautiful performance, a fitting valedictory to a long and illustrious career. Yet it still sounds like a performance, a wonderful orchestra playing a wonderful piece of music, whereas this Lemminkainen is like a dream unfolding. Kind of hard to explain the difference, I know.\nThe symphonies share this same organic feel.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Ride The Lightning is one of the best albums of the thrash\/speed metal genre and along with their next album Master of Puppets is Metallica's best work. While their first album Kill 'Em All relied more on speed metal, Ride The Lightning showed the band expanding their musical horizons and their songwriting abilities, which would lead to their breakthrough in America.\nEvery track here is very strong with many of them becoming metal classics. The band wrote some of their best lyrics here as many of the tracks deal with personal issues such as drugs, death, and the struggle within. There is much diversity to be found here whether it's the excellent speed metal of \"Fight Fire With Fire\" and \"Trapped Under Ice\" or the longer epics \"The Call Of Ktulu\", the title track, and the awesome \"Creeping Death.\" The menacing \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\" and \"Escape\" are also very strong tracks. Then there's \"Fade To Black\", the best track the band has ever recorded, and is to heavy metal what \"Stairway To Heaven\" is to classic rock. This is simply an incredible song, between its several different movements and its lyrics which tell of a man contemplating suicide. The guitar solo from Kirk Hammett during the song's outro is one of the best ever of the genre. Simply one of the best albums ever recorded in heavy metal. Highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":3}

My personal favorite song on Avalon is probably \"My Light\". It is the more commercial sounding song of the album but still stays in the theme of the record. \"The Departed\", \"Eyes of a Child\" and \"Cast Out\" are all great too.

{"text":"As the story goes Martha Reeves went to work at Motown as a secretary sometime around 1962 for the paltry sum of $35.00 per week. As Martha recalls \"As part of my job I had to audition other artists, schedule musicians, maintain studio logs and be 'girl-friday' to all the writers and producers. If I clapped or sang background on sessions that was an additional $5.00 each.\" Like so many other artists who came to work at Motown in the early days, Martha Reeves just wanted to get her foot in the door. You see in her spare time she was the lead singer of a local Detroit group known as the Del-Fi's. Her ultimate goal was to get an audition and get a recording contract for her group. Soon the Del-Fi's were hired to sing background on several of Marvin Gaye's early records. Berry Gordy quickly realized that these girls were something special. The group changed its name to Martha and the Vandellas and within just a few months the group was riding high on the Billboard Hot 100 with their debut single \"Come And Get These Memories\". It was the beginning of a fabulous run for this extremely talented and highly energetic group.\n\nMotown wasted little time in issuing the follow-up single. Released in early August 1963 \"(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave\" would become one of the biggest records of that summer peaking at #4. To me the pulsating sounds of Martha Reeves and the Vandellas were the personification of Motown's moniker \"The Sound of Young America\" and this is one of the finest examples. Five stars all the way baby!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Dear Music Appreciators,\n\nThis is my first experience with Gloriana and I know very little about them beyond the information that is available on Amazon.  Sometimes that can be a good thing though, coming to a new group with a clean slate, no expectations, uninfluenced by any hype...\n\nBasically, this is Lady Antebellum.  This is top forty twang pop.  I'm guessing this group will find legions of female fans.  The two male singers appear to be very attractive, with just the right mix of metrosexual country and bad-boy accents (check the tats on Blondie's right arm). And the female singer sandwiched between them is the dude fan bait.\n\nI had high hopes for this album when I heard the twangy, opening guitar lick and the harmonies on the words \"old\" and \"soul,\" but then things quickly got less interesting (lines like \"...everything I need is in your eyes,\" can seem awfully contrived in this kind of musical setting).  Then a song about making love in a parking lot, then a song about making love in a bedroom, then a song about kissing on a porch, then a pretty good little song called \"Carolina Rose\" that sounds like something Kenny Rogers might have done in his better days.  Songs about falling in love and breaking up , the obligatory small town memories song, a patriotic, support-the-troops song - it's all here, and Gloriana may look good and sound good, and this album may even have many enjoyable moments, but for me there is just something missing.\n\nThis album is like grape soda - looks good, tastes good, many people might claim its their favorite, but I won't be craving it without some caffeine.\n\nSincerely,\n\nConstant Listener","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Sounds can become layers, but Im not sure if the same sounds are their own one layer.  A musician must live in a habitat thats special and desired until theres an end, so sounds follow with his or her pursuits.  Its true that instruments play in part because of Earths weather, although Id have to consider musicians with their daily routines as well as their vacations.  Musicians rest and play so well, since goals are a matter of proclamations and livelihood, and slogans can be collections of memes like Walk Of Life that contain pressure from so many artist feelings.  While its true that a feeling can be a bad association of ideas, thinking is not everything.  Dire Straits vague perceptions are interesting and stimulate our imagination about beats in relation to cultural clues over golden oldies and turning all the night time into the day.  Im not sure if all the keys can be revolved around a single layer of music as they can several layers of music; the song itself is an interpretation of decades of music, so sounds themselves can become great memes if they're continuously passed down by musicians and listeners.  Walk Of Life is open for interpretation because the 20th century of music was lived for by millions of musicians and listeners, and thus art is more like a proclamation of life rather than its exact description.  If some Amazon reviewers give this song four stars and think that two and two make four, Id tell them that mathematics is collections of memes like songs and that cultures just have to begin somewhere.  Just Dire Straits place in history can be like time itself, and the layers of music from Walk Of Life nourish out of their creative nature to shake up the boundless definitions of music until our ears drip with the healthy, vivid tunes.  The songs layers of music are definitely not built up like a planet so much as a dream, and they're constantly serving up Dire Straits cognizance of music society when they're refining the beats to suit their individual perfection of song estimates.  A singers woo is an abstraction of typical animal roars, so memes about dedication and devotion can be special abstractions rather than just mere acceptances.  Due to this observation, poetry must be at least one abstraction.  Mark Knopfler really digs Johnny!  Its probably confusing to talk about feelings apart from descriptions for the same reason that a musician is often feeling after given descriptions.  Walk Of Life is designed with magnificent echoes, at least metaphorically, and the vague sound levels ramp up on the songs own composition as though they slightly stick to hard substances such as the loudest voices and the gluey arrangement of cultural memes.  Of course, listeners can stipulate what kind of progress lives with a song if they actually describe in their heads the emotions possible and impossible before going on to feel it.  Dire Straits is a present of golden thunder which rocks the sparks after settling down slightly with the peaceful storms, and Walk Of Life is a popular example of theories in practice from creativity.","classification":5,"fold":3}

This slow song rings of the vocal stylings and musicianship of Prince and the singers of the 80s.  She has a soft soprano voice which is rather weak but it works for the purpose of this song.

{"text":"These epic compilations, and usually for a good cause, have always managed to stumble me, often leaving me to feel that by reviewing something of this nature, that I would be less than noble by leaving people to feel that the endeavor is hardly musically worthwhile.\n\nCertainly the Grateful Dead in all of its incarnations has left us with a staggering catalog of music, and like all artists, often times hearing another musicians take on a song might spark a light, bring back some long forgotten memories, and perhaps bring some fresh vibes to the table.  Though having said all of this, there seems to be but a few artists on the outing who actually fit the nature and theme of The Grateful Dead ... in that theyve nothing in common with the late 60s and early 70s mind-bending psychedelic alternative country weirdness that spawned a movement that lives on to this very day.  Most of these artists, try as they might, merely see these songs as bits of broken mirrors that they can neither piece together, or fully understand the nature of what these songs reflect.\n\nMajor exceptions of course are Touch Of Grey by War On Drugs, Box Of Rain by Kurt Vile, Goin Down The Road Feeling Bad by Lucinda Williams.  These artists, along with the other twelve tracks that Ive kept, have managed to not only make the songs their own, but have managed to find the heart and soul of the numbers they cover.  Most of the other artists, while presenting a good rendition, just don't own what they're doing.  Most of these songs will not give you respect for The Dead, they only showcase the artist whos presenting, leaving me to feel that many of the songs by the nature of their presentation ended up not being even faithful variations of Grateful Dead music.  All and all, there is not a cohesive flow, no contextual point of reference, no emersion that guides you down the rabbit hole and out the other side a changed person.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","classification":2,"fold":3}

{"text":"It has been quite awhile since there has been any good songs that have came out from Robin Thicke. The past few years have been more sad from his personal and professional life. From the end of his marriage to Paula Patton, to him being sued and losing for using one of Marvin Gaye's songs that made Blurred Lines, from Got To Give It Up. Also, with the lackluster status of sales for his Paula record, Robin has been more on a downward spiral in regards to his work. But he has tried to truly return with better, and his latest song is a bit more of a feeling that he can bounce back from heartbreak. Morning Sun, Robin's latest single is a bit more upbeat and stronger than most of the songs he came out for quite awhile. It does work nicely from his heart and his own work. The song definitely has a lot more heart from it, and really shows a deep shadow in his own work coming up again. Hopefully, when Robin comes out with a new album soon, there can be more great songs that can work like this one showed, as big of a heart he has gotten. It is his best song since Lost Without U.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","classification":4,"fold":3}

His pianist stylists are somewhere between Bill Evans and a quiet dive bar's lonely player.

Prior release No More Hell To Pay is continued here, but with a bit of harder rock sound.  To me, NMHTP had more of a classic rock sound, while Fallen has more of a hard rock sound.  Overall, this is a easy review, great music.  Stryper is alive and well.  Michael Sweet has put out a few solo projects in-between the two newer Stryper CDs which have both been outstanding - his solo record and new joint venture with Lynch.- Only To Rise.  While the solo work is lighter, the Sweet Lynch project was a hit with solid a solid rock should.  But make no mistake about it, when Stryper reunites, Michael Sweet is at his best.  Stryper is a band that has a instant sound that makes just about every song an instant classic.  While Stryper has released many different types of rock music over the years, they are back with NMHTP and Fallen.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"England Dan & John Ford Coley \"were an American pop rock duo composed of Danny Wayland `England Dan' Seals and John Edward `John Ford' Coley. Native Texans, the duo released eleven albums and nine singles in their career and are best known for their 1976 single, `I'd Really Love to See You Tonight,' a number 2 pop hit and number 1 Adult Contemporary hit. After they disbanded, Seals began performing as Dan Seals and launched a country music career through the 1980s which produced 11 No. 1 hits.\" Another reviewer writes that England Dan & John Ford Coley's music was along the lines of \"light pop\" with \"a touch of folk;\" and I agree!\n\nThese five tracks are some of their very best music; I love the way they performed so well! England Dan & John Ford Coley could harmonize flawlessly and their melodies were easy on the ear and memorable as well. \"I'd Really Love to See You Tonight\" got lots of airplay when it was originally released and it still sounds great in our time! \"Nights Are Forever Without You\" is a little masterpiece that is timeless; it has great electric guitar work and the arrangement overall is very strong. They cover Todd Rundgren's \"Love Is the Answer\" so well that Todd would surely approve and \"It's Sad to Belong\" is very poignant. The track set ends with England Dan & John Ford Coley performing their awesome \"We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again;\" this is yet another evergreen classic that I could never tire of hearing!\n\nBig fans of England Dan & John Ford Coley will probably have most if not all of these songs already, so I think this music is best geared toward more casual fans and people just discovering their artistry. True, it's very sad that Dan Seals passed away all too young; but he does live on through his music.

Quite apart from the sheer visual and tactile whack of this thing - the big news for fans is brand new remasters from first generation tapes by TIM YOUNG in conjunction with the band at Metropolis Studios in London. We should talk about the REMASTERS because they're fabulous. Tim Young's notes in the \"Extras\" 3-disc set explain that \"Rope\" has had the first generation tapes used for the first time to his knowledge - so I immediately went to my favourite track \"Guns On The Roof\" - and WOW is the only appropriate response. It sounds just incredible with all that guitar power you always thought was buried in the mix somewhere now to the fore. \"Drug-Stabbing Time\" and \"Stay Free\" are even better - leaping out of your speakers with renewed venom.\n\n\"London Calling\" is like a different animal (\"Jimmy Jazz\", \"Death Or Glory\" and \"Train In Vain\" are unbelievably good with \"Train\" running out longer by about five seconds) - but to my ears \"Sandinista!\" feels the least improved. It's definitely clearer on the bass and rhythm section (\"The Magnificent Seven\" and \"The Call Up\" and Timon Dogg'svocal on \"Lose This Skin\") but the differences are not as stark as the first 3 LPs - they're just subtler. Despite the sprawl of \"Sandinista!\" - I've always loved it precisely because its like \"The White Album\" or \"Exile On Main St.\" or \"Physical Graffiti\" - you can dip into it and still seemingly find something new every time. The choral brass arrangements at the beginning of \"Somewhere In England\" is now gorgeous while the game-machine noises on \"Ivan Meets G.I. Joe\" are even more manic. \"Somebody Got Murdered\" and their take on Eddy Grant's \"Police On My Back\" are much improved - ballsy as they should be. Back to \"London Calling\" and I'm impressed with \"Lost In The Supermarket\" and \"Brand New Cadillac\" - comparing them against my 1999 versions - there's more going on with the high hats, drums and bass. And that Rock 'n' Roll guitar as \"Brand New Cadillac\" begins punches way above its former weight now. I also love the way each of the CDs has their original vinyl bits reproduced - the \"Armagideon Times\" for \"Sandinista!\", the inner sleeves of \"London Calling\" made into one fold-out lyric poster - the inner and poster of \"Combat Rock\" combined in the same way - and all the CDs are black like vinyl LPs. The driving backbeat behind \"Combat Rock's\" Side 2 standout \"Overpowered By Funk\" is a little improved but I can't say I hear much difference in \"Should I Stay Or Should I Go\".\n\nI own the Singles Box Set on CD so I compared the remasters and again the \"Extras\" versions are far superior - that guitar into on \"Clash City Rocker\" and distant Strummer vocal are better - and the balls of \"I Fought The Law\" is truly fantastic (a cover of an old Bobby Fuller Four hit). And my favorite B-side ever - their genius take on Willie Williams reggae tune \"Armagideon Time\" sounds like its going to do your speakers harm. That amazing bass and percussive beginning of \"The Magnificent Dance\" (the 12\" remix) has jaw-dropping sound quality as does the US 12\" B-side \"The Cool Out\" (an instrumental version of \"The Call Up\") - both with meaty rhythm sections. The early Polydor demos show a band getting there and the expert Glyn Johns produced that amateur feel out of the first album. I'm not sure I like them having loved the originals for all these years. Other disappointments include the outtakes on Disc 2 like \"The Beautiful People...\" and \"Kangaroo Court\" which are wholly dismissible and \"Sean Flynn\" has huge hiss levels on it. But I'm glad to see that Metropolis again mastered the DVD because the picture quality on the Don Letts and Clash On Broadway segments is brill (you get a sense of their danger live).\n\nTo sum up - \"The Last Gang In Town\" and \"The Only Band That Ever Mattered\" - there's been an awful lot of knob written about The Clash across the years (what about the Ramones, The Pistols or even Television) - and \"Sound System\" conveniently exorcises out the infamous and horrible end of \"Cut The Crap\" in 1985. You could also argue that you'd be better off just spending twenty quid on the simpler \"5 Studio Albums Box Set\" released in tandem with this - but I'd say if ever a band deserved this kind of over-the-top celebration - then England's heroes The Clash are the boys. And when you think of how EMI has consistently cheaped-out Stranglers fans with card sleeves and little else - thank God Sony stumped up. I love the care and attention that went into \"Sound System\". So there you have it - all those old bits spangly new again and presented to us in a fabulous setting.\n\nTim Young has described remastering The Clash's six years of output as a 'labour of love'. Well - while the future may indeed be unwritten - I suspect his brilliant work here (in conjunction with surviving members of the band) will be written about for decades to come. Well done and Career Opportunities to all involved...\n\nPS: as of December 2014 - Amazon's price has fallen from over eighty to sixty four quid - perfect gift territory for the Clash City Rocker in your life...","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"For years I have been searching for a perfect New Age album (besides Andy Summers' 1988 guitar-and-synthesizer classic Mysterious Barricades), and I believe I have finally found one in the form of Ken Elkinson's new release, Music for Commuting.\n\nMusic for Commuting is really a series of 6 CDs, most beautifully packaged as a compact and easily portable box set of 3 CDs with two albums each. To paraphrase Elkinson's description of each two-album set, Disc 1: Monday\/Tuesday is dark and edgy, Disc 2: Wednesday\/Thursday is more buoyant and based on Elkinson's love of 1980s synth pop, and Disc 3: Friday\/Beyond is spacey and futuristic.\n\nRegardless of these distinctions, the music on all six albums or three discs is really of one accord. Although there are latent guitar and percussion sounds on some tracks, the music is generated entirely with keyboards and synthesizers and sounds exactly like keyboards and synthesizers, and like Mysterious Barricades, the emphasis is on texture and sound, laced with beautiful melodies, tantalizing chord progressions, and ethereal chord washes.\n\nEven with such a single style and sound, each of the 60 tracks in the box set is original and unique, setting it apart from most other instrumental albums that need to mix up styles and genres to maintain interest. This is quite an impressive feat on Elkinson's part and speaks to his masterful compositional skills.\n\nThe music itself functions on several levels. As the title suggests, it's perfect for commuting. It's also ideal for meditation and relaxation. It's intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually satisfying. It's akin to a religious experience. It would be a great soundtrack for a science fiction or fantasy movie.\n\nListening to Music for Commuting is like swimming in an ocean of bliss. Its cascading layers of soothing sounds have the effect of mental therapy, like acupuncture for the mind. It is the epitome of pure New Age music and as a result is one of the best in the genre.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Deducting a star from Muse is not a put down.  It merely means that they haven't quite reached the level of brilliance they did with \"The Resistance\", my favorite album of theirs.  \"Drones\" finds the band retracing a little bit toward the earlier heavier days, around \"Origin of Symmetry\", with more guitar riffing and flat out rocking this time.  After the pop direction of \"2nd Law\", a fine album that was a bit more commercial, Muse apparently decided to remind fans they could still write good tunes and rock at the same time, something many bands can't do any more.\n  Matt Bellamy is a musical wizard, equally adept at gorgeous classical piano, industrial keyboards, and blistering guitar, and handling the songwriting and singing.  We get rocking songs for the most part, and as we go farther in, the album does some shifting to somewhat less bombastic territory.  The Queen influences as always are present, and nowhere more so than the closing title track, as the CD closes with A capella voices taking over to the final \"Amen\".\n  \"Drones\" is strong, but as stated before, it is up against very tough company.  But that's what makes the band great.  Why they're lumped in with alternative crap is a mystery.  They have nothing to do with the mindless soulless drivel coming from alternative music, which is actually bland mainstream safe rock for those afraid to truly rock out or know a good tune when they hear one.  Muse is a big nod back to a time when bands were truly innovative and created albums that will never be equalled.  Far from retro, they show us that music of the caliber of the best rock from the mid'60's to the early '80's is out there, and those who can never seem to break out of their musical cocoon really should check them out.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Sounds like Brian's finally snapping out of that 20-year commercial \"haze\" which very nearly swallowed whatever remained of his credibility as a legit multi-talented recording artist. 'Better' (going by the audio samples here) feels like the kind of album that really should've followed his sophomore release 'I Remember You' back in the late-90's. While that particular album focused primarily on the piano-heavy ballads, 'Better' effectively showcases a more energetic, uptempo side of Brian that he struggled to master a bit earlier on in his career. The production also stands out as well (best since 2005's solid yet largely uneven 'Gemini'), with polished LIVE musicianship and arrangements galore. I think there was only ONE track total that featured any hint of programmed instrumentation (the one with guest rapper Glasses Malone?), but it really didn't deter from the overall flow of the album which tells me that Brian definitely has learned his lesson in terms of not letting \"trendy\" guest artists (rappers ESPECIALLY) overtake his studio projects. I do like his reggae-inspired collaboration with native Hawaiian singer Kimie Miner, however. Didn't see that one coming, but it was a most welcome surprise indeed! Hopefully, this newfound sense of musical versatility will continue for Brian as he takes on further projects in the not-too-distant future. From my honest perspective, the man certainly needs to make up for lost time after giving much of his core fanbase three decades worth of watered-down compromises that served him well financially yet stagnated him artistically during that stretch.","classification":4,"fold":3}

I've Voyaged To India numerous times since I've acquired this cd and just can not get enough of this mind, body, and soul candy.\nThe songs on this cd are beautifully arranged and performed flawlessly. Alot of the lyrics are pure poetry; expressing love, exhortation, positivity, and all the things that would make us better people to humanity, ourselves, and loved ones.\nThe vocals and music showcased on this stellar project are warm and enchanting. \"The Truth\" is my absoulte favorite track with its haunting background vocals and its acoustic spanish motiff. \"Little Things\" is tight and has that \"All That I Can Say\" by Mary J. music flavor. \"The One\" is a catchy tune that will have you singin' \"Laa Laa Laa Lalalala\". \"Interested\" has a nice groove that gets the neck to moving and foot stomping. I could review every song on here, but that would take too long so do yourself a favor and comp this JEWEL.

I do remember unexpectedly discovering this disc in a used CD store sometime ago, likely as many as umpteen years back. Obviously, this live CD was to support their 'Cross Purpose' 1994 title. No dis to Ozzy, but vocalist Tony Martin doesn't ham it up like the Oz does (personally, with this gig I didn't exactly miss that). I, for one thought that the setlist couldn't be better. Loved the way that Martin handled lead vox on Sabbath classics like \"Children Of The Grave\", the awesome \"Into The Void\" (one of personal favorites), the band's namesake \"Black Sabbath\", \"Wizard\" and a few others. Plus, I enjoyed the Martin-era Black Sabbath cuts like \"Cross Of Thorns\" and the rocking \"Headless Cross\". Needless to say, this a very enjoyable live '90's Sabbath CD to thoroughly soak in.

Lots of solos, guitar fills, thundering drums, and menacing singing. The political themes are as familiar as ever, with topics ranging from western civilization's decline, America's collapse, and a prick of an Emperor who falls into the proverbial trap of wearing no clothes (hello Obama!).

Her cover of The Four Tops classic is still just as definitive today, as when it came out in the mid 90's. For her to follow up what she did with I Will Always Love You from The Bodyguard was difficult, but the song is still a classic.

The song actually was a surprise that moved me so noblely. I really don't know why she doesn't even deliver songs like this one for her own albums.

{"text":"This album really has all you need from them. Candlebox is one of those bands that defiantly jumped on the Grunge band-wagon that conquered the early 90s in Alternative Music. The only problem is that they weren't as good as the bands they were most likely influenced from. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, and Soundgarden were just so much better and created a legacy in the trail they left behind. Candlebox just sort of had a moment where people enjoyed the sound of Grunge so much they were desperate for more and they heard \"Far Behind\" and instantly called it worthy. You could arguably say Candlebox is a one hit wonder, I disagree with that statement but its understandable why others might think that. What's included on this best of is really the best of what they put out. Everything here is really all you need to hear to truly see what they had to offer to music. Its a shame things didn't really work out for the band, but it probably wouldn't of mattered because its not like they put out anything that really defined a generation.","classification":5,"fold":3}

I take this songs meaning to symbolize the singers way of truthfully admitting that we do live in a world where many people are prejudged (even outside of Hollywood)based on physical appearance\/weight.  This song actually creeped into my dreams as an adult after I reluctantly accepted that I must get a handle on my weight not just for health reasons but reasons having to do with getting a job and how my value as a woman may be perceived (whether I like it or not). I took this song being in my dream as an intuitive warning to accept that reality that I just mentioned without feeling self-pity (I prefer to avoid public sharing when I had that dream).

{"text":"When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, and today's divas, she has became the most overexposed product in music today. Sadly, the quality of her voice has died and so has she in songs. But nevertheless, when she was a part of Destiny's Child, she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart. Her solo debut song Crazy In Love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work, and the beginning of her relationship with her husband Jay-Z. They have had other collaborations for her career like the wasted Deja Vu, and the recent Drunk In Love which sounded more like a waste of time in voice and heart, and Bonnie & Clyde '03. It isn't a good song, because it has been overplayed but the very least it is her best work with her husband. Still, there needs to be better in voice and being crazy in love.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":3}

{"text":"\"You'll see perpetual change...\"\n\nIn 2008, Yes vocalist Jon Anderson found himself ill and unable to tour for quite some time. The remaining band members decided to continue onward, hiring Yes tribute singer (with some prog cred in Canadian band Mystery) Benoit David. Able to capture Anderson's high-vocaled tenor quite well in concert, things went as well as could be hoped for as Yes toured for the next few years. Rick Wakeman had also departed again during this period (for the, um, 5th time), and his son Oliver took over on keyboards.\n\nYes has always been, from the very first departure of Peter Banks in 1970, a revolving door of players. We all have our favorite albums and lineups, but what always baffled me was seeing\/hearing comments by various fans who\ncannot seem to ever accept what is right in front of them, here and now.\n\nMaybe I am just less biased, having discovered Yes as recently as 1998, and I wasn't overexposed towards one particular band member or sound. My first Yes albums that I purchased that summer covered the span from the late 60s to the 90s, so I became a pluralist early on.\n\nOne of my early favorites was Drama. I paid $ 1.99 for an old beat up cassette of it at a used record store, and I'll never forget the first time I heard \"Into The Lens\" as I played it in the car. There was so much darkness, sadness, and emotion in the song. At the time, I had no idea who was singing or playing...to me it was just amazing prog music, and I accepted it at face value.\n\nI quickly formed an emotional connection to Drama, and while I also loved 90125, Close To The Edge, Talk, and countless other albums, I never understood the absolute rancor and negativity towards it. Especially coming as it does after Tormato (which has far fewer good songs, and perhaps Wakeman's ugliest keyboard tones, and Jon Anderson's weakest singing and lyrics up to that point), I couldn't see how anyone could comparitively dislike it.\n\nEverytime I saw Yes tour, I hoped and prayed, but they never played anything from the album (aside from maybe a quick snippet of \"Tempus Fugit\" during the \"Whitefish\" solo.) I never had the chance to ask Jon Anderson about it, but whenever I would bring it up at band signings to Alan White or Chris Squire, I would get an embarassed grin and some half-mumbled comment. It was like a kid asking for a toy, and a parent saying \"someday\", which really was a subtext for \"never.\"\n\nAs luck would have it, not only would Yes start performing Drama material again on recent post-Anderson tours (\"Machine Messiah\" and \"Tempus Fugit\"), but Oliver Wakeman was unceremoniously dropped, and Geoff Downes -- my favorite keyboard player, Buggle extraordinaire, and Asia flame-keeper -- would rejoin the band for the first time in 30 years.\n\nWith Drama-era singer Trevor Horn producing (himself famously responsible for producing 90125 and Big Generator in the 80s, which kickstarted Yes into a whole new fanbase), Fly From Here suddenly sounded very exciting...\n\nRegarding the split of Anderson and Wakeman...I will always enjoy their music, and their hugely important contributions to Yes. But they alone are not Yes. And quite frankly, much of their solo work bores me. I wish them the best, and I am excited about their project with Trevor Rabin for 2012, but I am objectively critical of their supposedly god-like status in Yes.\n\nWakeman hasn't had a single tasteful keyboard patch since 1972 (his playing is unvarnished thankfully), and Anderson's singing and lyrics (despite many exceptions along the way), hasn't done much for me in almost as long.\n\nNow, onto the music...\n\n\"Fly From Here\" is the album's 20+ minute title track, broken down into smaller sections. Beginning softly (and with a piano motif that almost brings to mind \"White Car\"), we launch into \"Overture\". Perhaps the highlight of the album for me, this is Yes at their epic best, firing on all cylinders. Piano is mixed with sighing 80s-style synth, and reverbed triggered drum effects create a forward movement as Chris Squire's chunky, thumping bass keeps a steady pulse. Right away it is clear that Trevor Horn's production has treated us to the best-sounding Yes album in quite some years, as far as clarity and space between instruments and vocals.\n\nThis intro smoothly transitions into \"We Can Fly\". Written in 1980 by Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes just prior to the Drama sessions, it was demoed and played live on the subsequent tour. Heard for many years on various bootleg recordings (and finally given an official release in 2005 on the boxed set The Word Is Live), it was introduced onstage as being \"on the followup to Drama\", which was ostensibly planned for 1981. This Yes lineup dissapated, however, and interestingly enough...30 years later...things have come full circle, and you could very well describe Fly From Here as that followup album, seeing as how it has 4\/5ths of the Drama lineup, and with Trevor Horn as a primary influence in the writing and recording.\n\n\"We Can Fly\" has beautiful keyboard and piano melodies, and the harmony vocals are gorgeous. New vocalist Benoit David asserts himself wonderfully, somewhat surprisingly sounding less like Jon Anderson and a bit more like Trevor Horn (more Parallels!)\n\n\"Sad Night at the Airfield\" (previously heard as a shorter demo by The Buggles) begins with some somber acoustic guitar by Steve Howe. It explodes with melody as the line \"...Of air, that clouds in the night as we breathe.\" This is one of the most gorgeous moments on the album, as the old Drama elements resurface again (Squire's bass, and Downes' old Fairlight keyboard.) This section is the highlight of the album for me, as the next verse brings everything a step higher, Howe joins in on pedal steel, and the vocals and keyboards reach a crescendo of esquisite beauty.\n\nThis is one of those stamped and trademarked \"Yes moments\", akin to the musical peaks found in \"And You And I\", \"The Revealing Science of God\", \"Endless Dream\", or \"Awaken.\"\n\nWe return to the original piano motif as we explode into \"Madman at the Screens\", which is basically the \"Overture\" extended with more instrumentation and lyrics. The music is joyful, bouncy, and dramatic, as it moves between the dynamics of darkness and beauty. The overall structure is very pop-oriented, and the little xylophone-type keyboard tones unconciously make me recall the best moments of ABBA. Near the end of the song, some classic Hammond organ joins in. And is that a Taurus bass pedal I hear?\n\n\"Bumpy Ride\" comes next, perhaps the most \"oddball\" moment in the suite. This has a strong Howe influence in the bouncy, quirky playing and guitar tone, and subtly reminds me of something that might have been heard on his\nfirst two solo albums. A fun mostly instrumental segment, it again moves from light to shade and back again. I'm very much also reminded of a sound that could have come from the Tormato album.\n\nWith a sudden changeover (almost too unexpected and odd, IMO) \"We Can Fly - Reprise\" ends the song suite as it began. Although not the most climactic ending on a Yes epic, it gets the job done.\n\n\"The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be\" is a good mid-tempo ballad, which grows on me more with each listen. Chris Squire handles the lead on this, and his vocals have always been underrated in the Yes recipe, as far as I'm concerned. This song is reminiscent of material on his 1975 solo album Fish Out Of Water, again recalling the past...\n\n\"Life On A Film Set\" is classic symphonic prog. The beginning of the song is highly similiar to any number of acoustic ballads to be found on the early albums by Yes, King Crimson, or ELP. The production and sound gets\nmore dense as it moves forward, moving from moody balladry to bouncy and joyful moments. When I sit back and objectively pay attention to all of the song elements, it really captures the Yes that I know and love so\nwell. A bouncy, fun, beautifully-layered song as only they could do it.\n\n\"Hour of Need\" is classic Steve Howe again, featuring his Porteguese guitar, which brings back memories of \"I've Seen All Good People\", \"Wonderous Stories\", \"Sketches In The Sun\", and \"Nine Voices.\" The harmony vocals are (again) gorgeous, and the moog keyboards join in tastefully here and there. This is Classic Yes, in the wonderful tradition of Fragile and Going For The One.\n\n\"Solitaire\" is an acoustic guitar piece, this time featuring Steve by himself. Howe's solo moments are always tasteful, refined, quirky, and reflective, and this one is no exception. This is very much in the same\nouvre as \"Mood For A Day\" and \"Masquerade.\"\n\n\"Into The Storm\" features songwriting contributions from all band members, and again with the bubbly bass guitar, piano, harmonies, and keyboards, sounds like something from the 1977-80 period. An upbeat, positive ending to the album.\n\nAs far as individual contributions, I would say that Squire's bass-playing and singing is top-notch as it has been for ages, Steve Howe sounds very refined, fiery and confidant (see what health food and meditation can do for you, kids?), and Geoff Downes does a good simple job of bringing in his poppy, quirky Buggles keyboards, while still retaining the classic Yes motifs of mini-moog, Hammond, and mellotron. Only Alan White (on drums) sounds a little subdued, but he has a few interesting textural shuffles and grooves.\n\nOverall, I think it is fair to say that Fly From Here is the (overall) best Yes album since 90125, and slightly edges out ahead of The Ladder, which (especially in retrospect) was quite amazing itself. It certainly sounds like the followup to Drama (in some parallel universe 1981.) Let's call it Drama 2.0.\n\n\"One word can bring you 'round...changes.\"\n\nYes will always be different things to different people. Its overall dynamic is sort of like a diamond...there are a lot of rough edges and dark spots, but turn it around slightly and you will see joyful, crystalline moments as well. To me, it's always been about the message of positivity, relationships, love, and change. Being truly progressive; trying new things, new approaches, new styles. Mixing some Indian raga with some country music. Some techno-pop with some arena rock. Some church choirs with some classical granduer.\n\nI am just extremely tired of how the band and their legacy have carried onward through the years. The group spent so many years chasing hit singles after the success of \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", and became blinded by management, technology, and money. Relations broke down, factions formed, and no one seemed to know how to capture the original band spirit of five guys sitting in a living room or barn, and just brainstorming and writing some music together on a set of drums, piano and acoustic guitar. Yes unconciously stopped believing in themselves, and the fans followed suit. When in doubt, keep it simple. And just do it.\n\nFly From Here is a fantastic album, and a great reminder of sounds and places that remind you of a distant past, while still looking over that distant horizon. Remember...We can fly...","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"The original release was a classic metal release. I do think that too many pinheads touted this as the ONLY sound of metal that mattered. blah , blah ,blah. in fact this was a disaster for metal as the genre became less and less melodic and well played until it's now almost a nonmusic entity with little listeners. However this release which may have led to metals downfall in some regards was still a classic cd release. In other words it should have been one of many styles of metal on the radio not the only kind and it's melvins influenced style among other groups was pretty good actually.  The disaster this sparked off wasn't the cd's fault it was the programmers who suddenly denounced all other forms of metal as bad and then proclaimed this group the messiah band, thereby insuring the death of kurt cobain who just wanted to make music.  This double release sounds pretty good and has extra stuff , but it does sound sonically different as well somewhat.  The real release is a five star cd , I still say though it's not a bit better than a five srar release of other types of metal.  like lets say the scorpions 'lovedrive'  a different genre of metal , but good stuff. there was room for all kinds of metal now all we get is stuff kurt cobain even would laugh at.  endless nickelback clones?  few singers that can sing, and worse playing,  which is ok when there's a variety of metal songs andtypes of metal on the metal radio station;over half have closed in the last five years by the way.  still this was a classic and should be seen as such. But not the end all of metal.  just one of it's branches that sadly overcame the rest and helped metal ;against the wishes of nirvana , spiral into the pits of todays one note boredom.","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"Great song, cheaper than iTunes you can not go wrong with this purchase. Plus use of the Amazon Cloud and Cloud Player make this an even better buy. In the review for the song itself, allmusic.com wrote \"The lush power ballad \"The Flame\" was penned by two British songwriters, but the band made it their own with Robin Zander's sobbing vocal dramatics and the haunting tones of Rick Nielsen's mandocello chiming behind the guitar and keyboard backing. The lyrics, almost always an afterthought in romantic power ballads, often hint at the Police\/\"Every Breath You Take\"'s school of disguising unhealthy obsession as sentimentality; the singer, unable to let go of his first love, which can be taken either as a scorned lover trying to see his failed romance as somehow cosmically ordained anyway, or as a vaguely disturbing intimation of stalking. It's more likely that the latter interpretation was completely unintentional, though, since the band's straight-ahead reading plays up the heartstring-tugging bombast. It was a perfect fit for the late-'80s' power ballad\/happy pop radio, and it was much better crafted than many similar offerings from the same period (most of which were by bands who had been influenced, indirectly or otherwise, by Cheap Trick themselves). While it isn't the most inventive song the band ever recorded, \"The Flame\" is an undeniable part of their legacy, and a well-deserved, better-late-than-never, chart-topping popular success","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"This past weekend I saw \"Lucy\" in the theatre (more on that later). As I was watching the movie, I made a mental note to myself that I needed to check out the soundtrack as I really liked what I was hearing in the movie. The soundtrack is courtesy of French composer Eric Serra, who has scored almost all of Luc Besson's previous movies (not just as a director). Serra is best known, though, for his controversial soundtrack for the James Bond movie \"GoldenEye\", which decidedly sounded unlike any 007 score ever heard before (or since).\n\n\"Lucy: Soundtrack from the Motion Picture\" (29 tracks; 49 min., and no, that is not a typo) opens with a restrained \"First Cells\", only then to crash into \"Mr. Wang's Bloody Suite\" (Pt. 1-4 and 5-7), really one long 8 min. suite, where we get a nice juxtaposition between the electronic elements and the more traditional orchestral elements. As you can tell, with almost 30 tracks in less than 50 min., many of the songs are 1 min. (or even less), merely musical snippets where a particular mood is established for a particular scene, and then we move on. Check \"Choose to Reproduce\", all 38 seconds of it, quite good actually in its dream-like sequence. The electronica pieces at times remind me of the Tangerine Dream soundtracks from the 1980s, check \"Lucy Goes Out\" (Pt. 1 and 2), which immediately remind me of the \"Thief\" soundtrack from 1981. It sounds great. Things are more abstract on \"I Feel Everything\", when the Lucy character realizes what is happening to her senses. \"Pleasant Drive In Paris\" (as ironic a song title as anything on here, considering what is going on in the movie) is criminally short at 35 seconds. But it's a minor quibble, and in the end this is a very nice soundtrack of mostly electronica and mood pieces. Buyer beware: this contain ONLY the score from Eric Serra, and not the other incidental songs in the movie. Hence \"Sister Rust\", an excellent new song from Damon Albarn that plays over the movie's end titles, is missing on here. For shame!\n\nA quick couple of words as to the movie: French writer-director Luc Besson once again delivers a highly stylish action movie that charms and entertains from start to finish. Kudos to Scarlett Johansson who is seemingly having the time of her life in her role as Lucy, the butt-kicking girl who will not take no for an answer. This movie is becoming of the big surprises of this summer's box office, and it's easy to see why: good story, chockfull of great action, and a killer leading lady. What more could one ask for?\n\nBottom line\" \"Lucy\", both the movie and the soundtrack, are definitely worth checking out! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"The band's bassist came up for the idea for this song. He had read about an elderly couple having\ndisappeared after leaving on a trip to a festival in Texas. The writer of this song romanticized the\ncouple's plight by having them, essentially, walking into the sunset and achieving happiness by\nlosing touch with the world. Don't read about what really happened to the couple.\n\nThe Way was released in 1998 as a single from the group's second studio album. I think this song\nhas a pre-sixties cum Mexicali-style vibe. It has a reverbed and not so precise rhythm and lead\nguitar parts that adds to the Mexicali mood. It also seems to be including some 80's style sounds\nas well. I think this is what makes the song feel different and stands out among the usual clean\nand pristine FM fodder.\n\nThe music's progression is familiar sounding as the rock piano does a single note pounding which\npushes the song along. That Mexicali chord progression lays down the feeling and then opens up\ninto a standard driving rock 'n' roll progression for the refrain. Then its back to the Southwest\/\nMexicali chords. I am reminded of one of those Southwestern sunsets, touring down the road with\nthe radio blaring carefree and away from the world.\n\nApart from the original inspiration, the lyrics are a nice story about a couple just taking off and\nlosing themselves among the stars. A highly romantic idea about the bond between a couple and\nhow they end up exploring their lives together. The music in the song says this that is not maudlin\nbut an adventure the couple are going on \"without knowing the way\".\n\nI gave this song 5 stars because of its originality in combining genres of music with the overlay of\na standard rock back beat. It is a nicely done song.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Flamingo (Deluxe Edition) by Brandon Flowers is an album I would call a \"beautiful mess\". I had high hopes for Brandon's first solo effort. I love The Killers and I knew that this album would be very different but sometimes change is not always a good thing. Brandon's voice and melodies have always bring his strong attributes but the concept and lyrical structure fall flat and after listening to this album for 56 minutes - instead of feeling refreshed, all I feel is confused and drained. Half of Flamingo is great and the rest is just so-so. Standout tracks include: Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas, Hard Enough (featuring Jenny Lewis), Playing with Fire (this track gets better as it goes along), Magdalena, Crossfire, On the Floor, Swallow It, and The Clock was Tickin' (a surprise gem).

{"text":"Drake has put together his first front to back classic album. Drake last album made him the King of hip-hop. But this mixtape\/album leaves no doubt that the crown rests on the 6 God's head. I can't stop playing this album. It's melodic, soulful in a bluesy auto tune vibe way. The rhymes are crisp, sharp and bold but believable. I always said that Drake worried too much about his legacy as one of the greatest. On \"if your reading this it's too late\" Drake sounds like nothing but the greatest hip-hop artist in the game right now. Salute to the6 God. Classic album","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"One crucial element that sets this apart from her debut&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Acoustic-Soul\/dp\/B00005A1PR\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Acoustic Soul<\/a>&nbsp;a year earlier is that...somehow the sound is very much more fully formed in many ways. Wheras the sound of the debut generally emphasized the artists \"naturalness\" this blends India's \"acoustic soul\" sound with a array of soundscapes,many of which are as equally funky and soulful.\"Little Things\" is an excellent example. It's groove,the heavy-on-easy style and unique chord changes could only come from the guy who produced her debut:Stevie Wonder. Just about all of the music here maintains his signiture writing style as well,even though India is more fully in charge of the production here. The lyrics are typically \"power of positive thinking\" but the wonderful thing about them is that India's great attitude and the sincerity and brilliance of her poetry really forgive any possibility for a clishe. Needless the say the moments when this album really catches fire are when the tempo goes up a little such as on the excellent \"Slow Down\",\"Can I Walk With You\" and the bonus cut \"Interested\"-all rollicking soul tunes then endow her formula with a lot of rhythmic strengh. Of course that doesn't dismiss the respectful tone of \"Talk To You\",\"Complicated Melody\" and \"Headed In The Right Direction\". The only song that confuses me a little here,where I love the lush music is \"God Is Real\". I realize the connection in the black community to Christianity runs deep and is significant but for the life of me I cannot tell if this song is advertising India's obvious Christian faith or if her intention is to point out that nature in itself is godly. Not being religious myself these kinds of ambiguous lyrics are always mildly curious to me. So while this album really serves mostly to establish that her huge success with the debut wasn't some kind of post millenium fluke this was really the last time,musically anyway India. Arie would have anything to prove.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"This was my first 21P recording experience. Below is my first listening reaction.\n\nI suspect that like many I WishListed Blurryface based upon seeing 21P on SNL where they performed Stressed Out and Ride... two very different, very strong tracks with impact and appeal to burn. I was intrigued by the \"newness\" (to me) of the sound and the personality of a bass\/piano & drums duo albeit backed by an 8-ish piece string ensemble and an unseen synth lurking somewhere. Of special note was the strength of the drumming vs. past \"power duos\", e.g., White Stripes and Black Keys.\n\nWhile a couple other tracks approach the SNL two's level, none quite achieve it and others don't come all that close. The reggae influence is present in more tracks than I was expecting. Its use give a feeling of \"sameness\" to some tracks... not a bad thing... just a bit impact diminishing. A couple other tracks were simply \"pop-ish\" and seemed more out of place approaching filler material.\n\nI was very impressed with the SQ of the CD. Everything was clear, clean and well placed in the sound field. Even the most rapid rap riffs were understandable to even my old, non-rap tuned ears.\n\nBottom Line: Even with the lesser material this is still easily a 4-star listen with enough good material to keep me from having to justify the price based on two outstanding tracks. While right now Blurryface will not send me running to 21P's catalog for more purchases with repeated listenings it may well grow on me.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"It was bound to happen if he lived long enough. Strange as it may seem to a generation, the generation of 68, the AARP generation, okay, baby-boomers who came of age with the clarion call put forth musically by Bob Dylan and others to dramatically break with the music of our parents pasts, the music that got them through the Great Depression and slogging through World War II, he has put out an album featuring the work of Mr. Frank Sinatra. The music of the Broadway shows, Tin Pan Alley, Cole Porter\/Irving Berlin\/ the Gerswhins and so on. That proposition though seems less strange if you are not totally mired in the Bob Dylan protest minute of the early 1960s when he, whether he wanted that designation or not, was the voice of a generation, catching the new breeze a lot of us felt coming through the land.\n\nWhat Dylan has been about for the greater part of his career has been as an entertainer, a guy who sings his songs to the crowd and hopes they share his feelings for his songs. What Dylan had also been about had been a deep and abiding respect for the American songbook (look on YouTube to a clip from Dont Look Back  or stuff from the Basement tapes). In the old days that was looking for roots, roots music from the mountains, the desolate oceans, the slave quarters, along the rivers and Dylans hero then was Woody Guthrie. But the American songbook is a big tent operation and the Tin Pan Alley that he broke from when he became his own songwriter is an important part of overall tradition and now his hero is Frank Sinatra. I may long for the old protest songs, the roots music, the odd and unusual but Dylan has sought to entertain and there is room in his tent for the king of Tin Pan Alley  (as Billie Holiday was the queen). Having heard Dylan live and in concert over the past several years with his grating lost voice (it was always about the lyrics not the voice) I wonder though how much production was needed to get the wrinkles out of that voice to sing as smoothly as the chairman of the boards.","classification":4,"fold":3}

It doesn't sound like the Manson of the 90's or maybe even of Holywood  but it definitely has a presence that is powerful. Marilyn Manson totally reinvents his songs on this album and combines his signature style with a sound that explores all kinds of new territory. There's some heavy, some softer but bass heavy songs, and alot of this album just has a sound that I can't describe but it is very cool. There are a couple songs that he doesn't get all the parts going the right way on but all in all, I would put this right below \"The Golden Age of Grotesque\" or maybe even \"Holy Wood\" . It's definitely Manson's best work since then and is really amazing. I suggest all Manson fans give this a try and maybe even rock listeners in general might like a few songs on here.

{"text":"Dear Music Appreciators,\n\nI just realized it has been thirty years since Chris Isaak released his first studio album, SILVERTONE.  Reagan was president, Springsteen was riding high on BORN IN THE USA, and MIAMI VICE was the hottest new show on television.  How is it that a man who is this damn handsome, who sings this beautifully, and who exudes such effortless cool hasn't become more of a household name at some point over all these years?\n\nFIRST COMES THE NIGHT is yet another reliable entry in the Chris Isaak catalog and the familiar ingredients are all present.  The Elvis meets Orbison golden vocals, the songs of heartache and breakup, the buckets of reverb, the shots of slide and Spanish guitar - and through it all that feeling that each song seems made for night driving, the beach, or the block party.\n\nBut there are some less common flavors here too, and they keep Isaaks music interesting.  I don't know if he has ever started a song with the chorus like he does on Reverie - and that chorus repeats and repeats until it wears a groove in your mind.  Baby What You Want Me to Do keeps  building until its spinning around the room with mascara running down its cheeks like a bad carnival dream.  The rock and roll piano of Running Down the Road is a welcome breath of fresh air from the typical guitar dominance, and it makes a brief return a few tracks later during Keep Hanging On.\"  Every Night I Miss You More is a straight up old school country song with a huge helping of twang, immediately followed by The Girl That Broke My Heart which sounds like something John might have sung on an early Beatles record.  This is all just really good stuff.\n\nChris Isaaks last release was a critically acclaimed double covers album of Sun Studio classics and Sun Studio\/Sun Records founder Sam Phillips was oft-quoted around the release as having said;\n\nI have always listened to Chris Isaak.  Hes very talented and his music is so damn honest.  Its incredible.\n\nI agree.  Ive felt the same way ever since hearing Wicked Game in seventh grade.  Im an adult now.  And after hearing FIRST COMES THE NIGHT it feels good to know there are still some musical artists I can count on.\n\nSincerely,\n\nConstant Listener\n\nP.S.

Her songs from her work with LaFace like Un-Break My Heart have ultimately withstood the test of time, but when word came out that Toni was going to collaborate with Babyface on a new set of songs, the question was would they be good? I Wish, the second single from their album Love, Marriage & Divorce isn't a bad ballad that shows the elegance of the piano through Toni's voice. While it does feel a bit corny through some of the lyrics of the songs, but nevertheless Toni does deliver through the song well through Babyface's piano playing. Still Toni is a much better singer than the idiots female singers of today like Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna, who have not shown beauty in voice through the song alone. This isn't a bad song as a wish that could be boldly granted.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":3}

So powerful that a radio station in Germany has chosen it for their Olympic theme song.\n\"Song for the Lonely\" ~ The first Amerian single and the most meaningful song is also very powerful and unlike Believe has no vocodor (cherbot) recrdings o her voice.\n\"Different Kind of Love Song\" ~ Cher said it herself...its \"Vocoded to DEATH!\" haha...its awesome super dancy..will be big in clubs\n\"Rain Rain\" ~ Smooth Ballad...cuts the dance theme a little,but still miraculousely is dancy?!?!?! Only cher!\n\"Love so High\" ~ Excellent song...has to be heard\n\"Body to Body, Heart to Heart\" ~ Kinda like Dov'e La'`more.  Very latin and very upbeat\n\"Love is a Lonely Place Without You\" ~ Great Vocals, Cher!! Super good song.\n\"Real Love\" ~ Kinda like Believe...very vocoded...excellent\n\"Love One Another ~ Remake of Amber's dance song...very good.

There is nothing wrong with love songs but i expected more than that from her. Her praises for a man gets a little tired. Overall, this is a pleasant CD to listen to.

{"text":"It isn't hard to say that this is a good album, it fact, it is not hard to say this album is nothing short of a masterpiece.  India. Arie delivers a brilliant sophomore album entitled, \"Voyage to India\".  In fact, if this album was really a \"voyage\" to somewhere, many would probably pay top dollar to be there!\n\n This is such a positive album.  The lyrics just make any listener smile.  Anyone who knows anything about India knows she loves to play the guitar, and it is evident that she loves the guitar when listening to her album.  There is a guitar in every song on the album.  Although I think she's a bit indulgent with the guitar, she doesn't bore the listener with it.  It actually sounds right nice and adds something distinctive to her album.\n\n \"Good Man\" is definitely an album highlight.  The lyrics are meaningful and real.  The song is about a man who has children and if anything ever happens to him, he wants his children to know he loved them and that he was a good man.  Many parents can relate to this song because it's the same way they feel about their children.  \"Talk to Her\" has one of those beats you can snap your fingers and bob your head to.  Aside from the laid back beat, the song offers a very relevant message in today's world; talk to women with respect (men).  This song has simple lyrics, but they say so much.  I love it!  \"God is Real\" is another one of the many beautiful songs on \"Voyage to India\".  This song has a very noticeable guitar in the background.  India's vocals are really good on this track, they help the song to be more believable.  The song is about questioning the existence of God.  India does an excellent job of stating her claim of why she thinks or as she says \"knows\" that God is real.  \"Can I Walk With You\" and \"The One\" are just nice love songs.  India's vocals are, again, on point for these tracks.  If anyone were to ask me to pick to tracks to listen to on this album, I'd go with these.  The album contains no fillers, just brilliant work by a great artist of today.  If debating on whether or not to cop this one, GET IT NOW!  India will take you by surprise, like she did men.  I am very impressed with the talent of this woman.  She's a shining star! 5 star album!\n\nMiKeisha's Top 5\n\n1. Good Man\n\n2. The One\n\n3. Can I Walk With You?\n\n4. Talk to her\n\n5.

Well, I recall listening to the entire album once only. Thereafter I had to do my Jack-in-the-box impersonation, jumping up no less than four times during the playing of the two sides in order to skip the instrumentals. The UK \"soundtrack\" adds seven songs not found in the movie. More Beatles music and less filler - I am at a loss as to why some people actually complain about this \"deal\"!\n\nAfter the disappointing Beatles for Sale this record is a quantum move forward. The seeds of Rubber Soul are evident throughout. The lyrics and the music disclose complexities not heard before this release. Each of the seven songs from the movie is excellent. Of the others It's Only Love and I've Just Seen a Face are standouts. The last song on the record is the last cover they ever did - a less than memorable Dizzy Miss Lizzie.

{"text":"If you're only familiar with the Bangles after they hit the top 40, you're in for a treat. This collection neatly compiles almost all of their pre-major-label recordings in one fell swoop. These were the days when they were still playing the clubs, with a sound that varied from pop to psychedelic flashback, all delivered with passion. If I could only have one Bangles album in my collection, this is it.\n\nFor the longtime fans, this compilation restores the whispered opening to \"Bitchen Summer\" as it originally appeared on the \"Rodney on the ROQ, Vol. 2\" vinyl (as opposed to the edited version that made it to CD). The tracks that are only now seeing the light of day are worth the price of admission if you already have the 60% of this collection that was originally released on vinyl. The live version of \"Tell Me\" is particularly exhilarating, and it's great to finally have a recording of the Bangles' cover of Arthur Lee & Love's \"7 & 7 Is\" which they've been pounding out since those first days in the clubs. If you've acquired, say, \"Outside Chance\" through some old Napster mp3 or something, you'll be thrilled to hear how much better this sounds; just listen to the mp3 sample and you'll see what I mean.\n\nWhen the Bangles were signed to a major label, over time their sound and vision was somewhat hijacked by their producer. Material being provided from Prince and Jules Shear, excellent though it was, tended to send a message that the label didn't have faith in the Bangles' own songwriting. For anyone who had any doubts, this collection sets the record straight. Pop, garage, rock, neo-psychedelia - this is everything you ever loved about rock and roll.\n\nFootnote: the DownKiddie label on which this is issued is the Bangles' original label from 1981 when, as The Bangs, they released their first indie 45 (\"Getting Out Of Hand\" \/ \"Call On Me\"). Those were the days when the artwork for that first single was assembled on their kitchen table. It doesn't get more indie than that.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"In early 2014, Mary J. Blige recorded vocals for a remix version of \"F for you\", a song by British electronic garage-house duo Disclosure. The remix was re-recorded for release as a single and became a Top 10 hit on the UK Dance Chart. Inspired by its response, Blige moved to London where she spent a month recording in RAK studios, collaborating with a host of young British acts. These sessions resulted in a whole new album, one which is set to rejuvenate MJB's career; she is coming hard with it, totally reinventing her sound. From her urban hip-hop days next to P. Diddy to Disclosure's deep house, she has come a long way. Often accustomed to, but not worn out by personal hardship, MJB is synonymous with soul-baring honesty and a roller-coaster range of emotions. \"The London sessions\" is proof of her evolution as an artist, a great example on how music has no boundaries. Personal favourite tracks include \"Right now\", mixing her deep, heartfelt vocals with Disclosure's smooth, yet detached, production (works a treat), and \"Doubt\", a pure, raw, anthemic ballad so real, it hurts (not since her \"No more drama\" days have I heard this much emotion from her). Shaping up to be one of her best albums, she did right taking a leap of faith. \"I was never expected to do more, jump further, move the extra mile. But breaking boundaries happened for me... And I won't stop as long as I live\", she says. Much o-Blige-d, Mary!","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"How Burton Cummings managed to get a monster hit out of an angry song that seems to come from a man who is in a rage about American women is beyond me. I'm guessing that it comes from the fact that this song, lyrics aside is a masterfully crafted hit of a song that carries emotion to match the lyrics. It is a very angry song but at the same time, it is a very liberating song. Without saying it explicitly, the song appears to be by a man, not an American, who is jaded by a recent relationship with an American woman. Since Burton Cummings is Canadian this would be an appropriate vantage point from which he might write. If you've ever felt used and unjustly dumped, this would be your choice of angry songs. However, it is a great hit on its own merit and deserves a spot in your collection.","classification":5,"fold":3}

Jingle my bell, though possibly inspired by Jingle bells, is a completely different song from the famous standard. Santa looked a lot liked Daddy (a cover of a Buck Owens song) should be familiar to country music fans, because several country singers and bands have recorded it, while Buck's original is also easy to find.\n\nThis is a Christmas album filled mostly with fun songs, although there are some more sober tracks as noted earlier; they add a nice contrast to the fun tracks.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"First, let me announce that the prinicipal complaint in previous reviews has now been taken care of. The composer names are now listed for every track.\n\nThen let me add that is another terrific box set from Bach Guild. Like T. Fisher, Donn Patton, and others, I own all of the previous Bach Guild Big Boxes, which have provided me with literally hundreds of hours of great music in excellent performances for a grand total of about 25 bucks.\n\nThat means there are only four new works for me in this collection, Dvorak's New World Symphony, Mendelssohn's 4 & 5, & Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, but I'm delighted to have gotten these newbies for my grand outlay of 99 cents--because these symphonies get really terrific performances, and these are what I'll focus on in this review.\n\nI had no idea that Vladimir Goldschmann, who directs all of these new works, was such a wonderful conductor. His \"New World\" is downright superb. When I put it on yesterday afternoon, both my son & daughter found their way into my small home office and sat on the floor to listen. I'm also particularly taken with his Mendelssohn #5 \"Reformation.\" I love Mendelssohn, but I've always been a bit \"meh\" about this particular symphony. But Goldschmann projects it with with genuine fervor, propulsion, and clarity of line, so that it truly comes alive. This performance is a real winner. The Mendelssohn #4 is also very good. The sound of the Berlioz is slightly harsh to my ear, but it's stil a fine, energetic performance.\n\nBach Guild may have run out of large-scale material for their Big Composer series, but these Big Symphony Boxes suggest a whole new direction based on Genres. I can already imagine Concerto boxes, Chamber music boxes, Choral \/ Oratorio Boxes (including some missing Handel \/ Somary performances), solo piano boxes, etc. I'll be happy to accept duplication of material from the previous boxes as long as the price remains so reasonable, and there's some good new stuff in each Box. And this seems to be true for other Bach Guild completists among the present reviews.\n\nSo, keep 'em coming, Bach Guild.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"AC-DC. That is far-and-away the first thought that comes to mind when listening to Airbourne's \"No Guts, No Glory.\" What other band can be used to describe the inspiration behind this group of Aussie-based hard rock revivalists? They do, after all, utilize bone-basic riffs, exceptional, memorable solos, a dry-sounding production job, bubbling bass lines, and 4\/4 drum beats. And Airbourne also feature a vocalist, in Joel O'Keeffe, that is content to just merely scream his head off (very much in the way the Brian Johnson does) most of the time. And his vocals practically, uh, scream \"vintage AC-DC,\" too, in that they are primarily centered around party-happy themes (i.e. alcohol) the vast majority of the time.\n\n\"Born To KIll\" is a really catchy and infectiously grooving song, thus making it a strong album opener. Needless to say, it is filled with memorable choruses and terrific guitar soloing. Later songs, such as \"Blonde, Bad, And Beautiful,\" follow this same blueprint, augmenting a screaming guitar solo with another positively unforgettable chorus. But first, we are treated to lead-single \"No Way Out But The Hard Way,\" which is an even better song than either of the two described above. It might darn well be an AC-DC b-side, what with its anthemic vocals, hooky \"hey! Hey!\" chant-along refrain, crashing cymbals, and impressively steep solo flights.\n\nLater on, tracks like \"Raise The Flag\" and \"Armed And Dangerous\" are two more fist-pumping metal anthems complete with more really tasty and memorable guitar solos. But with that having been said, let it be known that the album's best guitar solos abound in \"White Line Fever\" and the toe-tappable \"Overdrive,\" two songs that are filled with fantastic, wailing, and totally air-guitar-able leads. Elsewhere, the blistering \"It Ain't Over Till Its Over\" and the nearly-danceable, rock-out-with-your-c-out set closer \"Back On The Bottle\" find Airbourne dabbling with surprisingly up-tempo pacing, as well as delving headlong into squealing, screaming, glass-shattering guitar pyrotechnics. And as a final album standout, \"Steel Town\" is another insanely catchy and infectious, if albeit very repetitive number that is well-worth rewinding and listening to again at least twice.\n\nThe bottom line here is that the level of innovation present on \"No Guts, No Glory\" is practically zero. But all fans that are only concerned with only the here and now are sure to be thrilled with this very entertaining album. After all, it might not present anything really new or original, but even if it does nothing to reinvent the hard rock genre, it does make for a thoroughly enjoyable listen nonetheless.","classification":4,"fold":3}

The only reason I watched it was because he was on the show, vowing to stop should he get voted off.  That being said, I love the way he sings this song and I believe that only he can sing this song the way it was meant to be sung.  I'm sorry, but the other version PALES in comparison.  Only a consummate talent with his vocal range could do this song justice.  He does not SCREECH, he SINGS in an extremely high register that only people who know music can understand & he does it BEAUTIFULLY on this song.

{"text":"Forces of nature are a wonder to behold on their own, but when you combine them, well, that's when things get interesting. Fire and ice, wind and rain, sea and sand...yep, that's when it gets REALLY interesting!\n  There's no denying that both Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell are true forces of nature, both on the Country charts and in pop music in general. Over the last 40 years, they have both blazed a trail for other singer\/songwriters, playing a big part in developing the sound that eventually came to be known as Americana.\n  Harris has always played well with others (her pair of TRIO albums with Linda Ronstadt and Dolly Parton, Mark Knopfler, Gram Parsons, WESTERN WALL with Ronstadt), recording enough duets on her numerous solo studio albums to be able to put out a compilation of them.\n  Crowell, on the other hand, has pretty much worked alone (A duet album with ex-wife Rosanne Cash, TWIN FLAMES, was in the early planning stages, but was ultimately scrapped upon their divorce). So how would these two pair up on their first full-length disc together?\n  Well, to be honest, guite nicely. Everything about OLD YELLOW MOON just shines (no pun intended!). In fact, even though it's still pretty early in the year, I think it's a safe bet to say the disc is definitely in the running for 2013's Album of the Year.\n  One of MOON's strongest suits is it's flawless blending of traditional and alternative. The first three tracks are a prime example of this. First up is \"Hanging Up My Heart\", a song Crowell first produced 30 years ago on Sissy Spacek's lone solo recording. With it's spirited arrangement, chipper lead vocal from Harris and pitch-perfect harmonies courtesy of Crowell, you have the perfect album opener. Very nice!\n  Just as cool is \"Invitation To The Blues.\" With it's fiddle-drenched arrangement and sterling co-lead vocals, even the some what dated lyrics sparkle. I mean, how can you NOT love lines like \"Thanks for sending me something I can't use\/I received your invitation to the blues?!?\" SO sweet!\n  From here we do a complete 180, to the haunting \"Spanish Dancer.\" The gorgeous instrumentation (particularly the mandolin, guitar and accordion), Harris' plaintive lead vocal and the stunning imagery of the lyrics (\"The red dress of temptation\/Over a long black slip of fear\") all come together in sheer pop perfection. Lovely....absolutely lovely.\n  There's a stately grace to \"Open Season On My Heart\" that is undeniable. The song just...flows. The instrumentation, Crowell's weary, but strong, lead vocal, Harris' spot-on harmonies...all of it. This is master class artistry at it's sublime, soulful best. Brilliant!\n  Up next is one of my favorites, the gritty, spirited \"Chase The Feeling.\" This seductive toe-tapper gets under your skin and stays there, thanks in large part to the smooth co-lead vocals, Chad Cromwell's blistering backbeat and Reese Wynan's rollicking piano. Insanely tuneful, this cut firmly plants itself in your head and stays there long after the disc comes to an end.\n  Equally as strong is \"Black Caffeine.\" All edgy and dark, this bluesy rock-tinged number is about as far removed from what both Harris and Crowell are usually known for as you can get, but that's why it works so well. Slipping on their black stilettos and greasy engineer boots (you guess who's wearing what!), the pair just KICKS IT! Love, love, LOVE this cut....my favorite on the album!\n  Things slow down for the lovely waltzy vibe of \"Dreaming My Dreams.\" Between Tommy Spurlock's steel guitar and the strong lead vocals (the first time Harris sings the lines \"But I'll always miss\/Dreaming my dreams with you\"...oh...my...God!), this song pulls at your heartstrings AND socks you in the gut, all at the same time! Another winner.\n  \"Bluebird Wine\" is one of the first Crowell songs Harris ever recorded, but Crowell has never recorded it himself...until now. His lead vocal just dances over the lyrics, perfectly aided and abetted by Harris' nimble harmonies. And Brian Ahren's guitars?!? Once again, Oh...my...God! Yet another show stopper!\n  Next we have the introspective beauty of \"Back When We Were Beautiful.\" The emotion in this song is just palpable, with Harris wringing every drop of it out of every single word. When she sings \"I hate it when they say\/I'm aging gracefully\/I fight it every day\"...Wow! Toss in a subtle arrangement and great harmonies and you have an instant classic.\n  There's a relaxed, easy-going groove to \"Here We Are\" that's really, really nice, but after the slap-in-the-face intensity and emotion of the previous cut, well, the track just ends up coming off as slightly wanting. Nice enough, with great harmonies, but probably OYM's weakest track.\n  Slightly better is \"Bull Rider.\" Once again, this isn't a BAD song....it's just that pretty much everything else up to this point has been so, SO good! But there's no denying that A) Crowell's lead vocal is one of his best to date, and B) Harris is unsurpassed when it comes to harmonizing. And I LOVE the line \"You know the art of hanging loose is hanging just as tight\/Well it's something like a hurricane that's dancing with a kite!\" A really fun cut.\n  Things wrap up with the disc's hushed title track. Graceful, delicate, heartfelt, \"Old Yellow Moon\" is the perfect note to close on, with both Harris and Crowell just sparkling. Breath-taking.\n  And that's what's so special about OLD YELLOW MOON. Not only do you have two of pop music's best at the top of their respective games ~ and that's saying A LOT, considering the careers Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell have had! ~ but you also have a GREAT song selection. This album is also all about what a great duet is and should be. With OLD YELLOW MOON, you get twelve of them. I, for one, sure hope this isn't a one time event! (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics).","classification":4,"fold":3}

I can't help but smile when I hear the opening chords of this song.

{"text":"There's no denying how massive Hot Fuss was and the incredible pressure that The Killers were under when recording this record. Following a popular and successful debut is a daunting task for any artist and surely The Killers knew that going in, yet they managed to do the unthinkable: they not only made an even better record than their debut but they also shifted their style to keep it from merely being a rehash. The end result is not only my favorite offering from the band but also one of my favorite albums of all time.\n\nThe title track is the perfect opener, a muscular and bombastic piece with a decidedly more American feel than anything on Hot Fuss. These tracks are meatier and heavier while still retaining that great post-punk soundscape that they perfected initially. There are heavy traces of U2 and Springsteen running through Sam's Town, from the anthemic drive of \"Bling (Confession of a King)\" to Brandon Flowers' subtle falsetto on \"Read My Mind\". \"For Reasons Unknown\" finds his double-tracked vocals adding an extra layer of foreboding and suspense as he sings about waking up one morning and suddenly feeling no love for someone you've cared about. It's dark subject matter but one that rings all too true with the human condition.\n\n\"When You Were Young\" is perhaps the most popular track on the entire record and it remains a staple of their live sets. It has a relentless energy that's infectious and invigorating. \"Bones\", complete with horns, is one of my favorite cuts and it's a tidal wave of pure fun from start to finish. The cutting riff of \"Uncle Johnny\" is extremely cool and roller coaster ride of \"This River Is Wild\" makes it my favorite song on the album. It's breathtaking in its ability to pull you in and change dynamics so effectively. The pensive nature of \"My List\" and \"Why Do I Keep Counting?\" help to give the album  bit of breathing room and balance out fast pace of the album as a whole. The bookends of \"Enterlude\" and \"Exitlude\" are nice touches as well. In short: everything works and has its place. It flows from top to bottom and makes this a complete experience that listening to the standalone tracks just won't provide. As good as they are alone, they're even better when paired together. This is also the album where Brandon really branched out lyrically and he seems to be digging deeper this time around. Everything from family to spirituality to temptation to relationships to fame is covered and it helps to give this album a depth that Hot Fuss couldn't quite muster.\n\nSam's Town takes some getting used to but slowly it reveals itself as an ambitious and slightly darker effort. It's almost as if this town lures you in with promises of fame and fortune, then robs you and leaves you with nothing but broken dreams and empty pockets by the end. Each listener will probably come away with their own narrative but that's the feeling I get from many of these tunes. If there was any doubt about how good The Killers really are then this record should leave no doubt: they're one of the best. Venture into Sam's Town and see for yourself.","classification":5,"fold":3}

For Billy Joel, who has made great pop songs for nearly 20 years, his song still sound just as vibrant and distinctive as they did when they first came out back in the 70's, the 80's, and even the 90's. Sometimes the distinctive and classic style of a great songwriter still can deliver better than the joke artists of today. That has shown with Piano Man, New York State Of Mind and the classic We Didn't Start The Fire. The song still lights up the flame 25 years later after it originally came out and it still sounds just as driven as it did years ago. I still never get tired of the rhythm and rhyme into a great history lesson through time, as Joel pointed out into the song, and it still is better than the wasted acts of today. Maybe they should try and make a fire that still works like this song shown all this time.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"In 1992 P.J. Harvey released her debut LP. The Album Dry was released on an indie label and the budget was just around 5 thousand dollars. Often proclaimed to be one of females rawest and toughest albums this album took me as a suprise it is nowhere near the desription I read. Dry may be perhaps PJ.\nLess accesible efforts along with Is This Desire however it is an aquired taste and of course what kind of music you listen to. Less heavy and hard rocking and agressive as it's follow-up Rid Of Me. Dry has 7 fantastic songs Oh Stella, Victory, Happy And Bleeding, Sheela - Na - Gig, Hair, Plants and Rass and Water but the 4 other tracks are so forgettable. And also do to poor production the album which was obviously recorded in mono does not deliver the goods that it is supposed to deliver. It is sometimes disturbing and heavy but it doesn't exactly kick your butt because it is so hidden. It also laks in great hooks and brilliant guitar riffs like her other albums.\nHowever PJ. Harvey's Dry has indeed something special about it and lyrically it is very good much better then Rid Of Me but musically it is less compelling and challenging then any of her other albums but it is her debut and if this had only included these 7 songs it would have been an artistic triumph and something that polly jean would be proud of all her life.","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"This is the album that made George Benson a pop superstar. \"This Masquerade\" was a light jazz easy listening hit and \"Breezin\" was a hit too. \"This Masquerade\" had the unique distinction of hitting number one on the jazz, R&B, and pop charts; I wonder if any other tune has performed that trifecta. Jazz players will be very familiar with this tune and having the original version for library was the main reason I picked up a bargain version of the album. I did not realize, however, that the new remastered version has extra versions of some of the tracks as well as a version of \"Down Here On the Ground\" a very Donny Hathawayesque tune that I dig off of the \"Weekend In LA\" album.\n\"Breezin\" sounds like easy listening light jazz but it's a pleasing chart that I enjoy with its flute hook but it's got a nice groove to it as well and . This stuff drips with 70s production values and has a Bob James kind of sound. If you like that kind of light jazz than \"Breezin\" is an excellent album. I find it to be pleasing light jazz that doesn't wear as well as his \"Weekend In LA\" album, where the live performance brings out more fire for George Benson. This album was one of the blueprints for smooth jazz and folks that dig smooth jazz would be wise to look at Benson, with his soulful jazz chops and breathtaking Hathaway like voice before they dig into the latest thing playing on light jazz radio.\n3.5 stars","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"The Killers depart a bit here from some of their angrier work on an earlier album and venture into more upbeat territory with \"When You Were Young.\"  Someone plays a great keyboard on this single, while lead singer Brandon Flowers sings his heart out and the other musicians collaborate to make it even stronger.  Like Foo Fighters' \"The Pretender,\" this song makes a brief detour into a softer segment around the middle, then speeds up again as it reaches the end.  Compelling and easy to remember.","classification":5,"fold":3}
{"text":"I had heard a couple of their songs from their first album on the radio.  Especially liked \"Breakeven\" and \"The Man Who Could Not be Moved\".  With this second album, I loved the song \"Nothing\" so much and also thought \"For the First Time\" was great, so I decided to buy the album and see what else they have to offer.  Wow, is it amazing! Danny's soulful singing style and great melodies and lyrics have me putting this CD on constant replay.\nIf you like the style of the songs that have gotten radio play, you will love this sophmore album!  I now love the title track, \"If You Ever Come Back\", and \"Walk Away\".  I am kicking myself that I did not figure out how great they are before they toured this summer in the states.  I am sure their popularity will continue to increase and I won't have the chance to see them in a smaller venue again.\nOh well, they are that great and they deserve all the success they have!!!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"After hearing \"Love Calls\" on the radio, I had to hear more from this gifted vocalist. At first listen, I could hear the purity and the many dimensions of that VOICE, which is soothing, smooth like 18 year old Appleton, seductive, and playful. Kem is not your ordinary run of the mill singer but an extraordinary song stylist. His voice dips and dives, rounds syllables (much like Al, Anita, & Phyllis), scats, and just downright croons.\nAfter getting ahold of Kemistry I was not dissappointed, rather joyous of the fact that I owned a solid musical experience. This is adult music at its finest. The ambience is intimate and jazzy. The instrumentation is also complimentary to Kem's vocal prowess. There are also nice percussive elements that add to the vibe of the cd. My favs are \"Love Calls, Brotha Man (lyrics are beautiful), Inside, and This Place.\"\nThere's not much else for me to say about this product other than get this cd.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Yes it's hard to believe that it has been twenty years since Megadeth released \"Countdown To Extinction\", It was a creative peak for Megadeth at this time when you take in 1990's \"Rust In Peace\" and 1994's \"Youthanasia\". All three albums also featured what is considered the classic line up of Megadeth with Dave Mustaine, Marty Friedman, Dave Ellefson and drummer Nick Menza. \"Countdown To Extinction\" has already been re-mastered in 2004 with extra bonus\/demo tracks however the overall mix left a lot to be desired so the good news is that twenty year version is taken from the original version and is not overly compressed, nor does it suffer from the dreaded loudness issue.\n\n\"Countdown To Extinction\" would give Megadeth some of their biggest hits ever, the brilliant \"Symphony Of Destruction\" leading the way. There is the brilliant \"Foreclosure Of A Dream\" with its slower pace and political theme it's a song that is a true now as it was back then. The album is packed with great songs such as \"Sweating Bullets\", \"Countdown to Extinction\" with its driving bass and album opener \"Skin o' My Teeth\". This version omits the bonus tracks that were included on the 2004 re-master.\n\nAlso included is a second disc of a 1993 performance from the Cow Palace. It includes 16 live tracks as well as an intro and shows how tight that particular line up of Megadeth was. The live performance draws heavily from \"Countdown To Extinction\" but does include classics from their previous albums. Including a great version of \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\".\n\nWith this new twenty year anniversary release Megadeth have fixed the problems of the 2004 re-master that in all honesty was mixed poorly. With this release the selling point is an excellent second disc of a live performance of the band at the peak of their powers. The two discs come in nice slip cases and there are cards of the four members as well as new liner notes. If you are a long time Megadeth fan you will want to add this to your collection.","classification":4,"fold":3}

But honestly, hard core Aerosmith fans have wanted something even more, new music. There is so much awaiting with What Could Have Been Love, the lead single from Aerosmith's Music From Another Dimension album. The song is not bad, a straight-forward and simple throwback to Aersmith's earlier ballads from the 80's and 90's in tone. It doesn't drive up to those earlier songs the bad boys from Boston have made years earlier like Cryin' and I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing. But it is better than most of the cheap and cheesy music from acts like Katy Perry and Rihanna have made for the past several years.

I didn't care for the solo album too much, but of course love the first one and Cosmic Egg even though it didn't get much critical acclaim, I like the sludgier vibe on that one.

{"text":"There is no doubt about when it has came down to male singers, Rod Stewart has had a brilliant way of reaching people young and old through his gift of songs. Even with time and age those songs still haven't even lost their luster. His classics are still just as infectious today, as they did place a groove in the heart back then. His classic Do Ya Think I'm Sexy? is one of those songs that definitely brings out the sensuality of a classic male at heart. It is just as infectious as other disco anthems that have honestly withstood the test of time like The Bee Gees anthem Stayin' Alive and The Village People's Y.M.C.A. The song still gets better with time shows just what Rod Stewart has made out in song. I honestly do not get tired of this song, and if you are new to Rod Stewart's music, I sincerely recommend you have this in your music library. Do You Think He Still Is Sexy after all this time, Rod Stewart sincerely is.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Nathan Pacheco is one of those fortunate creatures who is blessed with an inherited good voice. His cleancut good looks and his warm audience presentation alert us to a new voice to whom we should pay attention and watch. But a bit of biographical background first: `Nathan Pacheco is an American singer\/songwriter born in Virginia, and is of Brazilian descent. He was a featured vocalist during the 2009 tour for \"Yanni Voices\". Nathan graduated from the music program of Brigham Young University, and also followed his love of culture and languages by continuing his education abroad in South America and Europe. Nathan spent over two years in Brazil, being immersed in its culture and allowing its influence to contribute to his musical development. He eventually traveled throughout Brazil, performing both classical as well as some of Brazil's cultural music. He also spent time in Italy, studying the language while performing with the Opera Festival of Lucca. In all of these adventures to different countries, he was relentless in his efforts to learn the languages. The result is his ability to speak and compose in English, Portuguese, Italian and Spanish. After auditioning for producer Ric Wake, who then introduced him to Yanni, Nathan began putting lyrics and additional music to some of Yanni's most famous works, such as 'Adagio,' 'Tribute,' 'Almost a Whisper,' 'Enchantment,' 'Secret Vows' and 'In the Mirror.' Upon completion of the recordings with Yanni, Nathan then joined Yanni and his orchestra as a featured performer on a 100 concert tour throughout Latin America, Canada and the USA.'\n\nNathan Pacheco's voice is powerful and lush and he walks that line between opera and pop. Whether he decides to bolster his operatic training and move into the opera\/recital stage as has Alfie Boe and others who began their careers in this middle of the road category or follow the path set by Ramin Karimloo, Andrea Bocelli, and others and simply please an adoring public with appearances in both solo and musical theater venues is yet to be seen. `I love writing music as much as I love singing. The art of expression in general is so appealing to me. That's what I feel when I write music. I love singing opera and I love pop, but I love blending the two. I try to sing songs that reach me, and whether they lean more towards classical or pop, it doesn't matter.' Nathan Pacheco is well worth watching as he makes his decisions about the direction of his career. Perhaps he will be happy with the crossover category and perhaps he will go for classical. He has the personality and looks and voice to succeed whichever direction he chooses. Grady Harp, November 13","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"There's less commercial flash (though it's still evident at times) and more personal effort from the members of Little Big Town on this, their second album, \"The Road To Here.\"  The album starts off fine with \"Good As Gone.\"  This tune drifts solidly into their radio hit, \"Boondocks.\"  This song, while drowning in commercial pop country lyrics, stands apart from most modern country due to the nice four-part harmony of the group.  Another standout from this album is their other radio release, \"Bring It On Home.\"  In fact, this is probably the strongest song on the album.  \"Wounded\" has a nice sound as well.  Songs like \"Bones,\" \"A Little More You,\" and \"Looking For A Reason,\" are good, but they all begin to sound alike as the album rolls along.  The only glaring downfall in this album is the hokey, pop country drivel, \"Welcome To The Family.\"  It falls into the same category as other silly tunes like \"American Honky Tonk Bar Association,\" where it seems that the songwriter tries too hard to make a cheesy country tune.\n\nIf you enjoy earthy, mostly acoustic four-part harmony, you'll enjoy this album.  People who likes glitzier country groups like Rascal Flatts will probably like this, though it's quite a bit grittier than the bland Flatts sound.  Fans of bluegrass-tinged groups such as Diamond Rio and even the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band will probably enjoy this much more.\n\nOverall, a highly recommended album, though Little Big Town hasn't quite set themselves apart from the crowd.","classification":4,"fold":3}

The song tells a story about the singer meeting an old lover at a record store. The story takes place at Christmas time but otherwise has absolutely nothing to do with Christmas! This song has more to do with regrets over missed opportunities.

{"text":"This is a great collection for the casual Billy Joel fan, which I am.\n\nI was introduced to Billy Joel back in the late 1970s and I have had some of BJ's music in my collections on and off for the past 30+ years.  Of course no compilation from a catalog as large as BJ's will meet everyone's personal preferences, but this is a great cross-section and contains many of his best tracks. With that being said, any serious BJ fan will already have the majority if not all of these tracks, so this selection wasn't made for them.  It was made for people like me, casual fans who like to sing along when songs from the old days come on the radio, but who have not yet added any of his tracks to our digital collections.\n\nAs I scanned down this list of tracks I saw at least 14 tracks that I'm excited to add to my playlists, and maybe the other 5 tracks will grown on me, you never know.  Anyway, 14\/19 is outstanding for any greatest hits album.  And since I snagged this during one of Amazon's $5 album sales that's a real bargain!  Thanks Amazon!\n\nWell, whenever someone looks at a \"Hits\" album like this they say, why isn't _______ on it!?  I decided that what's on it's on it, and since it's got lots of what I like then, click, I bought it!

{"text":"You can't tell from the generic album title, but Slaughterhouse, even with weak link Joell Ortiz, can be a clever bunch. They hype themselves as the best rap group out now, and, if that's true, it just means there aren't any great rap groups out now, but there is enough lyrical skill between the four of them to make inviting songs that would otherwise turn you away. That's literally the case with some of these songs as executive producer Eminem; a rapper who, once upon a time, would've easily outshined all four MCs; basically provides them with a tame collection of run-of-the-mill pop music. Rather than serve as a showcase for hip-hop; the only right direction to go with a group like this; the album seems to be made for the 2012 Billboard charts. A seemingly talentless Skylar Grey sings to emo Alex Da Kid beats. That fact alone flies in the face of what Slaughterhouse is supposed to be about. They may have \"made it\", meaning heightened fame and fortune for four rappers who've never been far above the underground, but the Our Way claim rings false.\n\nThere is nothing essentially wrong with commercialized rap music, of course. The popular bandwagon is often a fun ride. Eminem has proven that time and time again. This Slaughter-House simply isn't a good place to be. Both D-12 albums are better, for comparison, and I don't even like the second D-12 album. That isn't much of a surprise though. Eminem has been off-track ever since he went against his own Relapse; my second-favorite album of his; and ditched the twisted artistry of his Slim Shady persona for a watered-down pop hits Recovery. Listen to his forced flow on this album's title track, which does include a witty line about his daughter, and tell me it's any better than \"eh\". Not that he never shines anymore. The Asylum song, which he provides the chorus and beat for, is good. But it's only for the \"Deluxe\" version of the album, which means it has no affect on this review. The highlights that do count, like the Coffin drums and lyrics that are great as opposed to just better than most other mainstream rappers, are few and far between.\n\nmarcellee.com","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"I've been buying Amazon music for a while now and I love how Amazon offers low cost music and even free music from new artists. I listen to radio mostly and frequently I get tired of the same stuff and definitely tired of the over-played stuff (even if it's a great beat like Lady Gaga's \"Poker Face\"). I've never heard of Franz Ferdinand and I first heard \"Take me out\" on Amazon. The more I review songs the more I'm aware of my alternative music tastes (especially alternative music reminiscent of 1990's alternative).\n\nFor me, good alt-music has a rock beat with a twist--something different, unexpected, experimental even. I think this can be subtle or obvious and very subjective definitely (in the eye of the beholder or the ear in this case). Sometimes a repetitive beat is annoying (one reason modern country music doesn't do it for me); but sometimes it's classic (like Elvis Costello's \"Pump it up,\" Chuck Berry's \"Johnny B. Goode,\" or Elvis Presley \"That's Alright Mama\" and even some old-skanky-country like Hank Williams' \"I'm so lonesome I could cry\"--old-skanky-country is a term of endearment made up entirely by me). By no means am I comparing \"Take me out\" to the classics, I'm trying to explain how I base my reviews.\n\nWhat caught my ear on \"Take me out\" was the initial repetitive rock beat (it's fast with a hint of punk) guitar and drums dominate; it's a great mix with the singer's voice (is he singing or screaming--it's hard to tell, there's an angry sound to his voice which is fitting with the punk aspect of the music). A minute into it, the beat transitions to a slower, deeper, harder rock sound (hm, interesting choice of words yes? If good music doesn't make you think sex, maybe it's not good music. Anyway, a very sexy transition IMO). There are hints of 70's disco in the cymbals in the chorus (or what I think is the chorus). There isn't much variety in the lyrics or rhythm for that matter; but sometimes that just doesn't matter. The beat keeps the song moving along. The lyrics do borderline on the monotonous but it's an easy song to sing to--maybe Franz doesn't have much to say. It's the only song I've listened to from Franz Ferdinand. I like it, a lot.\n\nWith Amazon's 20 million songs, there is so much to listen to! I rated this song 5 stars because I am very happy with my purchase. I love songs that are a change from the mainstream.","classification":5,"fold":3}
{"text":"Mary J. Blige continues to bring it on practically every album she releases these days. And Growing Pains is no different. She busts out with the highly energetic and super sassy \"Work That\" to lead off the album. Then, like a well-produced mixtape, it seamlessly segues to the equally groove-happy \"Grown Woman\" featuring a decent rap from Ludacris. We are then delighted with the first single \"Just Fine,\" a simple ditty with a happy-go-lucky Mary expressing herself like only she can. \"Feel Like A Woman\" is a slower cut that basically tells men to treat her like a lady. \"Stay Down\" is a more serious track about pushing on through the tough times and not giving up so easily. Those same sentiments are reverberated on the songs \"Talk To Me\" and \"If You Love Me.\" \"Hurt Again\" is a smooth track that discusses the inner battle between being in love and not setting yourself up for a broken heart...yet again. Usher has the album's only other cameo appearance for the straightforward \"Shake Down.\" \"Till The Morning\" has an old school bounce to it, with lyrics from Mary to match. \"Roses\" is one of Mary's most powerful songs of recent memory, essentially saying that it takes more than just the little things to make a relationship work. \"Fade Away\" speaks about losing a love and having trouble facing the world again and moving on with all the heartache consuming your spirit. \"What Love Is\" is a very deep and analytical song about the different emotions and moods that truthfully depends on your current status with love. \"Work In Progress (Growing Pains)\" is a self-explanatory track about Mary still being just as imperfect as the next person. Mary gets a little abstract with the simple yet cryptic track \"Smoke,\" leaving room for the listener to draw their own conclusions on what she's really talking about. The subdued power ballad \"Come To Me (Peace)\" closes out the album on a positive note. Growing Pains is definitely closer to her classic material even though it doesn't quite reach those heights on it's own. Nevertheless, MJB brings us another solid effort to enjoy until the next album comes out. And with a formula that is obviously working, Mary J. Blige will certainly bring it once again.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"It's time for another Big Bach Set - this is one of our rare Volume 2s (that's a LOT of music if we're getting to a Volume 2). But as we are going through the great symphonic works, it's inevitable to find ourselves with a Volume 2.\nAs the Big Symphonies Volume 1 showed the importance of the Vienna State Opera Orchestra, Big Symphonies, Volume 2 shines the spotlight on the other orchestra woven into the fabric of the Bach Guild catalog: the Utah Symphony Orchestra.\nPerhaps not as forgotten as Vladimir Golschmann, Maurice Abravanel's reputation remains more well known because of his still-strong base of support in Salt Lake City. But Seymour Solomon seemed to change his general theory of recording and producing for one man - Maurice Abravanel. Never a \"completist\" like Mendelssohn at Vox, Solomon picked works out, and rarely felt the need to record complete cycles of any composer's works. But Abravenel was different - and somehow the chemistry worked, because the only complete cycles in Vanguard's catalog feature Maurice Abravanel and the Utah Symphony Orchestra.\nWe can't brag about anything unreleased from the Utah Symphony - there are a few items unreleased, including a Rachmaninov 3rd symphony that didn't make it on here for copyright reasons - but the orchestra that Abravenel built is well represented here.\nIf you're looking for the goodies in this set, then feast your ears on the Charles Ives symphonies. Long out of print on any format, this boxed set marks the release of these works in digital format. Conducted by Harold Farberman, these fine performances - interpretation and sonically - are long overdue for a revival in attention. So while unfortunately due to the fact that Shostakovich and Prokofiev are still in copyright and therefore a little too expensive to include in a .99 cent download, we can provide you with a remarkable set of recordings from the vaults.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Although it's hard to believe, but John Mayer hasn't always gotten the respect that he deserves. Even when he released his 2001 debut \"Room For Squares\", he was instantly pegged as a Dave Matthews clone. Not helping matters was the fact that his debut was produced by John Alagia- the same guy who also worked with the Dave Matthews Band. He decided to switch things up a little with his sophomore effort \"Heavier Things\", where his music was still the same in sound and production- except that he forgoed acoustic guitars for a more electric sound. Fast foward a few years later, when John made an attempt at making a soul music record with \"Continuum\". That album was his tribute to his favorite album at the time, D'Angelo's sophomore effort \"Voodoo\". He loved that album so much, that four of the session musicians that played on \"Voodoo\" (trumpeter Roy Hargrove, bassists Charlie Hunter and Pino Palladino as well as late guitarist Chalmers \"Spanky\" Alford) all appeared on \"Continuum\". He then followed it up with the underrated \"Battle Studies\", which picked up where the last recording had left off. After a three year hiatus, John returned with his latest release, the country flavored \"Born And Raised\".\n\nJoining him for the production of \"Born And Raised\" is the producer Don Was, who is best known for his work with Bonnie Raitt, The B-52's and The Rolling Stones. He starts the album off with the mild uptempo track \"Queen Of California\" in which he namechecks his musical influences. On the Celtic influenced ballad \"Age Of Worry\", he urges to those who are concerned with making mistakes to not be afraid of taking chances. He insists to put his bad days behind him on the first single \"Shadow Days\" and searches for musical inspiration on the acoustic ballad \"Speak For Me\". On \"Something Like Olivia\", He searches to find a woman who's similar to the one who he discovers is already taken. He sings of not wanting to be alone on the title track \"Born And Raised\", and sings from the perspective of a teenaged kid on \"If I Ever Get Around To Living\". He takes a less optimistic view on relationships on the bluesy \"Love Is A Verb\" and gets help from trumpeter Chris Botti on \"Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967\". He sings of wasting his time away on alcohol on \"Whiskey Whiskey Whiskey\" and falls madly in love in such a short time on the ballad \"A Face To Call Home\". While John Mayer's \"Born And Raised\" shows him stepping out of his comfort zone, deep down it's still the same old John under a new genre. The overall theme and sound is noticeably melahcholy, but it works well with the concept of the record. In short, it's an album that's actually pretty good.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Others have reviewed this disk far more exhaustively & insightfully, so I'll not try to compete with their word counts, much less their insights. To them, I say, ditto.\nJust felt the need to add, if you are wondering how Toad would sound after all these years away, the answer is, just fine, thank you very much. This is not just a rehash of their 90s sound - but that familiar vibe does in fact imbue this disk. The boys seem to be both grounded in, yet move beyond, that signature sound. And frankly, they sound happier: beneath the upbeat melodies often lurked heartbreakingly sad lyrics, a distance, a depression. The same is true for a lot of Glen's solo works. I haven't had this disk long enough to really get to know the lyrics, but while hardly trivial, most songs seem to be much more at peace than the angst-driven lyrics that underlay even some of their most accessible tunes.\nI do agree with others that the packaging leaves something to be desired. I get that we're trying to be eco-friendly - but mine arrived in the mailbox bent. Happily it didn't affect the playability of the disk.\nThis is a quibble, though.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I have always loved Sammy's voice, and felt his singing talents were underplayed within the Rat Pack. I looked for a Sammy Davis Jr. CD for a long time and was glad to have found this one. It provides a wide range of songs; some of which were made famous by him. Best of all, it excludes the \"chatty verbage\" and jazzy arrangements often included in live performances that can make a song sound so dated. I particularly love \"As Long as She Needs Me.\"","classification":5,"fold":3}
{"text":"This album may not be for you if you're expecting the next Pretenders disc. It may not be your thing if you prefer Chrissie Hynde rough and rockin'. And you should DEFINITELY pass on it if you're not into the whole Joe Cocker\/Van Morrison\/Tom Waits\/Rod Stewart vibe!\n On the flipside, you should DEFINITELY pick it up if you like variety, a softer, more introspective Hynde (think a less Countrified version of the Pretenders' excellent 2008 disc BREAK UP THE CONCRETE), and great vocal teamwork.\n Coming out on a small indie label, this disc is probably going to disappear within months, with few people, Pretenders fans or otherwise, knowing it had ever even been released. And that's a shame, because it's one of 2010's few pleasant musical surprises. (Yes, J.P. Jones may be an acquired taste for some ~ or most! ~ but I think he balances out Hynde quite nicely. Additionally, there's no questioning the fact that he's a VERY strong writer).\n Things get rolling with the thoughtful, brutally honest \"Perfect Lover.\" Hynde delivers a smooth, shimmering lead vocal, perfectly backed by Jones' raspy harmonies. A subdued, yet crisp, arrangement brilliantly supports the pointed lyrics: \"I found my perfect lover\/But he's only half my age\/He was learning how to stand\/When I was wearing my first wedding band.\" But it's the line \"I found my perfect lover, but I'll not impede his way\/His time is tomorrow, mine was yesterday\" that really hits you like a ton of bricks. A VERY powerful way to start things off!\n Up next is the blistering \"If You Let Me\", probably the album's most rocking track. Anchored by Geoff Holroyde's thundering drums, Hynde and Jones vocally spar back and forth, making it clear that it'll all be worth it in the end if someone's just willing to take a chance (\"If you don't want me to come in\/You better lock the door\").\n \"Fairground Luck\" is one of the few cuts that just doesn't work for me....it's kind of like a bad Sonny and Cher tribute! The arrangement is uninspired and limp, while the vocals are routine and\/or iffy at best....Hynde's are phoned in, while Jones' are all over the place, bouncing from a pretty nice upper register to a generic mid-level rasp. One of FIDELITY!'s few clunkers.\n Far superior is \"Australia\", definitely one of the disc's best cuts. Equal parts breath-taking and heart-breaking, everything just comes together perfectly....a lovely arrangement, exceptional instrumentation, brilliant co-lead vocals and smart lyrics, both her's (\"I was proppin' up the bar on my own\/Mostly guys like you say good-bye to me\/And never offer me a ride home\") and his (\"Eyes as blue as your's deserve a symphony\/I ain't got the whole song but I've got melody\"). In the end, the song is all about hope....what more could you ask for? In a word....perfection!\n Just as good is \"Misty Valleys.\" No doubt about it...this cut is Hynde's vocal tour-de-force here. Slinky, soaring, sparkling, smooth....there's a lushness and sensuality that just eminates from the speakers. (However, she's ALMOST upstaged by Sam Swallow's gorgeous piano fills!). Without a doubt, one of Hynde's Top Five vocal performances to date. Simply brilliant.\n I consider \"Courage\" to be one of the disc's other weaker tracks...it's not that it's a bad song, it's just not in the same class as most of the rest of the album. It's just...O.K. The arrangement is O.K., the vocals are O.K., the lyrics are just...you guessed it, O.K.! I wouldn't go so far as to say this is filler, but it's certainly nothing more than.... well, O.K.!\n Jones' shining moment is the haunting \"Leave Me If You Must.\" Part Richard Harris, part Johnny Cash, the oddly lilting instrumentation juxtaposes the slightly cryptic vocal, which brilliantly dances around the stark, striking lyrics: \"In a different life I'd cling to you and cover you in dust.\" Another gem!\n And then there's \"Meanwhile\", another favorite of mine. Think Christine McVie, at her most atmospheric, not to mention her sultriest. Weaving in and out, up and down, and all around, both the arrangement and Hynde's lead vocal positively dance. Exquisite harmony and backing vocals cap it all off. This is a hit waiting to happen! Or..it SHOULD be!\n There's a relaxed swagger to \"Your Fairground\" that die-hard Pretenders fans will love...with it's economical arrangement, assured lead vocal and tight harmonies, this strong cut could have easily fit on any of the first three Pretenders albums. Not a classic, but just what the disc needed right at this point.\n \"Never Drink Alone\" is another vocal dynamo. Starting out slow, soft and subdued, it's soon soaring. Hynde's crystaline vocal is perfectly offset by Jones' sandpaper rasp. It's all layered over an arrangement that, while laid back and unobtrusive, is never wimpy. Yet another winner.\n Things wrap up with the alt-country-flavored title track. \"Fidelity!\" has it all...an amazing arrangement, full of acoustic guitars, piano and tamborine, silky vocals and smart, sweet lyrics (\"Cuban rum, what did I say?\") all come together perfectly, resulting in just...the...right...ending!\n So....I don't know if J.P., Chrissie and the Fairground Boys is an on-going thing or not, but FIDELITY! is, without a doubt, one of 2010's nicest surprises. That said, do yourself a favor, and spend some time strolling around the Fairgrounds! (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics).","classification":4,"fold":3}
{"text":"Awesome song! I love to hear Robin Thicke, Pharrell and T.I. do this one really well! This is irresistible music; it'll sound great a decade from now for sure. This is really catchy and the lyrics are not bad, either! The music fits perfectly with the vocals to make this one strong tune! True, as a few others noted you may want the cleaned up version if you have kids around who might hear this; but otherwise nothing but this \"everything spelled out for you\" version will do.\n\nIt's great to hear Robin and the others performing so well--they have a huge hit on their hands and I highly recommend this tune for just about anyone who loves to dance or workout to this type of music. It's even good as an excellent song to listen to after a hard day at work--it's that upbeat! They deserve a lot for credit for releasing one fine song!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"April 2006 saw the two great surprises from two great Chicago bands. One is Survivor's Reach album after 18-year break. And the other is this one. Full-length new material release from Chicago. I am not sure under what counting method could this one be their thirtieth. Probably including compilations and Christmas albums. I lost track of Chicago since Night and Day album in mid 90s(22nd release). But that one is sort of tribute. So the last album I FEEL Chicago is Twenty One in 1991. Yeah indeed listening to XXX is like meeting a LONG LOST FRIEND.\n\nFEEL the first single from this album is static at first but from the mid section it turns dynamic. Reminding me of the Chicago during \"18\" album.\n\nKING OF MIGHT HAVE BEEN is tried-and-trued style of Chicago ballad during 80s. WHY CAN'T WE tries duet but unmistakably typical of Chicago styled ballad. Most surprising one is 90 DEGREES AND FREEZING. Just like Earth Wind and Fire and groovy and I hope Maroon 5 cover this one. So thrilling and my best song of the year so far.\n\nVerdict: My favorite band returns stronger than ever.\n\nRating: 95 out of 100. One of the finest comeback efforts.\n\nRecommended for: Wide range of pop rock fans.","classification":5,"fold":3}

But for Lionel reworking on his classics for his album Tuskegee, he went back to the basics and a country twist on his classics. Lionel and Shania teaming up for Endless Love, actually feels fresh and new to a whole new era of fans. The song sounds pretty good from beginning to end, and a nice new start for Shania Twain. While Lionel showcased bits from himself, to the classic he had made with Diana Ross, there still is a lot of chemistry between the two of them in song and heart.

{"text":"..It is considered one of the greatest '90s albums for a good reason, even if it was hyped out of proportion. It didn't \"start\" alternative, it just brought it closer to the masses. For someone like me, that's just a great thing. Putting history aside, here's a few misconceptions from naysayers:\n\n\"Nirvana's music only appeals to suicidal and\/or emo kids\" --> I know plenty of people who listen to Nirvana who love their lives, myself included, and although I used to hate it, my liking of this album had nothing to do with that. \"Nevermind\" isn't even that gloomy. If I read this review, I'd think it were a review for a goth band or something. This isn't the Sisters of Mercy. There's humor on \"Nevermind\", which shows that Cobain did have some high points, whether you loved it or hated it.\n\n\"I blame them for inspiring (insert inferior band)\" --> Nice shot, but every band who makes it in the mainstream is bound to influence some people who don't have a clue or talent with their music. You may not like it for this reason but it's not that valid to why these guys \"aren't that good.\"\n\n\"The guitar playing isn't very good\"--> Well, it looks like you just need to open your mind: It's YOUR problem. Just because they aren't being complex doesn't mean anything. Listen to prog-rock bands for that; fans of it annoy me to begin with. Nirvana's inspired by PUNK, which is meant to be simple, and these songs have hooks and edge in them, which makes \"Nevermind\" so great.\n\n\"it's overproduced garbage, the other two albums are REAL Nirvana\" --> Sure, Cobain may have claimed to be ashamed of the production. But if you like albums such as \"Grace\" by Jeff Buckley which were also mixed by Andy Wallace, you suffer from HYPOCRISY. This actually brings a diversity to the band's music, where the other albums would've sounded a bit more same-y if done otherwise. I like how it's got that crystal-clear shining through, although it's probably not what Cobain wanted the album to be. It was really well recorded and that's why \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" still sounds wonderful in the context of this album.\n\n\"it isn't metal!!!\" --> Yeah, and what does it matter. Lots of Nirvana fans don't like metal anyway.\n\nI won't argue that it's highly regarded, but some of the people on this site are just being ridiculous. I also don't like how some people ignorantly judge the audience and THEN whine about how others judge them. Look at yourselves. This was influenced by the loud\/soft dynamics of the Pixies, although it's not quite as quirky and a bit more pop-based. \"Nevermind\" is an album that is worth owning, even if people have blown its praises out of proportion. Either way, I think an even better choice would be \"MTV Unplugged in New York\". \"In Utero\" is great as well and is on roughly the same level as the album. However, the songs here seem more developed and \"complete\" which is why I tend to enjoy it slightly more.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Kevin Parker is the main brain behind Australia's Tame Impala, and the band's debut album, 2010's \"Innerspeaker\", was quite the intruiging debut album. Now comes the second album.\n\n\"Lonerism\" (12 tracks; 52 min.) starts off with a nerversly drum-driven, high-energy \"Be Above It\", a fantastic track. It is followed by \"Endors Toi\", another all-out energy track. It isn't until track 3 \"Apocalypse Dreams\" that we start to get a real sense of where this album is going, less guitar-oriented than \"Innerspeaker\", even if the next track \"Mind Mischief\" actually finds guitars and drums very upfront. The album truly takes off with the next track \"Music to Walk Home By\", with synthesizers all over, a theme that would continue for most of the album. \"Why Won't They Talk To Me\" is in the same vein, and at this point I'm thinking that Tame Impala has become the (beautiful) bastard child of Film School-meets-The Secret Machines. Now we are into the heart of the album, with an outstanding lazy-feeling \"Feels Like We Only Go Backwards\", followed by an even greater \"Keep on Lying\", with a delicious 4 min. instrumental outro (with lots of sound-trickery overdubbed, and I mean that in the best of ways). It is one of my favorite tracks on here. It is followed by a guitar-heavy (and hard rock sounding) \"Elephant\" (1st single), which sounds out of place with the rest of the album, yet somehow it works great. The first 9 tracks are a prefect 5 stars. After that the album starts to falter a bit, we've had the best moments by then. The album should've closed with \"Nothing That Has Happened So Far Has Been Anything We Could Control\" but instead is followed by an unnessecary piano-based \"Sun's Coming Up\", but it's a minor quibble.\n\nIn all, this album is one of the biggest (pleasant) surprises for me this year, and clearly one of the year's very best albums, period. Sure to make my \"best of 2012\" albums list, and very high at that. I can't wait to see this band in concert at some point! \"Lonerism\" is HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n*UPDATE* New US tour dates have just been announced and these guys will be in Columbus in late March. Barring unforeseen circumstances, you can bet your last dollar that I will be there front and center.\n\n*UPDATE* (March '13) I saw these guys live this past weekend, and they put on a blazing show, simply outstanding.

I'm glad I did because it renewed my interest and reminded me how much I liked their music. \"If\" is one of several favorites on the \"best of\" album,  \"If\" spoke to my late teen romantic heart.

Just listening she can't help but let loose a tear. This makes it even more special to me and I'm certain it brings up special feelings for many.\n\nBread provided music of the 70's that was approachable to a wider audience. While many hard rock fans dismissed them, a few decades on I appreciate them more than when they were performing. I like how much their music means to friends and family just a bit older than me too.\n\nI'm glad I gave them another look.

{"text":"I just made the statement not long ago that Metal was a dying art. While that may be true, Mustaine, Ellefson, Loureiro, and Adler are proving that they a very fine artists of the genre. Dystopia was Megadeth album, not to mention the metal album, that world needed. The guitar work on this album is phenomenal, some of the best I've ever heard from the band. Adler, as always, is proving himself as one of the great American metal drummers. Speaking as a bassist, and a huge fan of Ellefson, his work on this album is absolutely killer. Every song on this album is straight thrash metal and sounds amazing. Lyrically a lot of songs are hitting close to home about politics and economics, and the content is something I think everyone can relate to in some way. When Slipknot made their comeback last year their fans said their new album would save metal, no it won't. That was not metal. Dystopia is pure, unadulterated metal. Absolutely all killer no filler, and more importantly, no BS. I think anyone would agree, this is the best work the guys have done in years. I love this album, and it has every right and every reason to not only go down as one of the bands best, but one of the best in metal period.

{"text":"There was life for Huey Lewis and Sean Hopper when their first band became a no-leaf Clover-pardon the pun.  Together with bassist Mario Cippolina, drummer Bill Gibson, and lead guitarist Chris Hayes, Huey and friends got into journalism, well, Huey Lewis and the News actually, and they created their biggest headlines with Sports, their tertiary 1983 album, which yielded four Top Ten hits, yet somehow or other, I managed to hear all songs from Sports, making this one of my all-time favourite news... I mean classics.\n\nSports takes what they improved on in Picture This, their tried mixture of soul and doo-wop harmonies, but with a lot of radio-friendly zing!  \"The Heart of Rock & Roll\" is a paean to the risqu, rowdy, and sensationalistic night life of big cities like New York, where one can do \"half a million things at a quarter to three.\"  Part of the song's chorus-\"now the old boy may hardly be breathing\" may be a reflection of the cul-de-sac rock music had gone through at the time, but leave it to Huey and the boys to give it a strong jolt in the arm-aww yeah!  The second of three singles to reach #6, and love that heartbeat-like drum that opens and closes this classic number!\n\n.\n\nThe first single from Sports was \"Heart and Soul,\" penned by Nicky Chinn and Blondie-songmeister and producer Mike Chapman, which alternates between some easygoing keyboards from Sean Hopper and some snarling grinding hard-edged guitar chops from Hayes.  This became their second Top Ten hit, peaking at #8.\n\n\"Bad Is Bad,\" a 50's blues-tinged doo-wop number, yielded a video, yet didn't crack the Top 100.  Bad is given both connotations, cool re the cousin who plays his guitar with a chainsaw buzz, and tasteless regarding a man finding a note reading \"I love you\" and \"someone else's shoes, underneath my bed.\"\n\nFor sheer energy, how can one beat \"I Want A New Drug?\"  This search of a new panacea instead of those pharmaceutical nightmares or under-the-counter pills celebrities pop, indicate a criticism of the  pharmaceutical industry but also of Hollywood itself perhaps.  Lewis later sued Ray Parker Jr. for cribbing the rhythm of this for \"Ghostbusters.\"  I do detect some similarity between the songs, but fortunately, the matter was settled out of court so there wasn't a repeat of George Harrison vs the Chiffons.\n\nThe fifth single, \"Walking on a Thin Line,\" reached #18, begins with a pulsing high-tech sounding bassline which becomes the backbone of the song, before going into a rocking song of frustration about an ex-veteran, and the scarring aftereffects of war.\n\nI remember the mid-paced doowop rock with a tinge of beach harmonies, and third #6 single, \"If This Is It,\" from the video on MTV, and both video and song paralleled, of a guy fed up of the relationship games being played.  At least the video had a happy ending, as a nice-looking blonde who had witnessed the scene between Huey and the woman in question, wordlessly invites the dejected guy to walk along the beach with her.\n\nThe boisterous \"You Crack Me Up,\" with its running synth line, harmony backups, rapid-fire delivery from Lewis, and neat Hayes guitars makes this the best non-single of this album.  I bet they could've released this as a followup to \"Walking on a Thin Line\" and made another Top Ten single.\n\nTheir cover of Hank Williams' \"Honky Tonk Blues\" is a great pub rock tune complete with John McFee on steel guitar that rounds off the album, except for the bonus tracks, which are live or demo takes of the singles.\n\nI was surprised I didn't wear out my copy of the cassette when I first bought it long ago.  Hearing this remastered version, that polished production of the News' sound, and the infectiously catchy melodies brings back fond memories when music was great.  Thanks to them, the heart of rock and roll kept on beating...for a while longer anyway.","classification":5,"fold":3}

The historic aspect is this is the first of four collaborations between Peterson and Jackson and it presages the ones to come.\n\nListen to the sound samples on this page and even those short snippets will reveal the magic of this album. I am not going to try to dissect the music or impose my personal taste on you, but if you love swinging and tight quartets with a piano and vibraphone in front you will be more than pleased with this album.\n\nWhile I promised to not dissect the music I will say that the intensity that Jackson brings to the performances match the backing trio - Peterson and bassist Ray Brown in particular were renown for intensity even on ballads, and drummer Ed Thigpen fit right into that as well. So the chemistry among the four is natural and one of the reasons why this album appeals to me.\n\nThe album was recorded for Verve in NYC over the course of two sessions (September 15 and 18, 1961.)  Sadly there were five unissued tracks from the sessions, two of which are logged as 'untitled Peterson originals' that I would have loved to have been included in a reissue. Regardless, the music that is on this album is definitely worthwhile.","classification":5,"fold":3}

I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.\n\nBut youtube exists now.  It's not like you need to base your purchase on what other people think.  You listen to the song, and if you like it enough to want it on your mp3 player (or in better quality than youtube)... (or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.\n\nI guess I'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review...

{"text":"\"Redeemed\" by Big Daddy Weave is so powerful that the song could help someone become redeemed by listening to it.  When I hear the words, \"I am redeemed, I am set free, so I cast off these heavy chains, wipe away all my shame; I'm not the man I used to be,\" how can I not be overcome with gratitude and moved to tears by the sacrifice that Jesus made for all of us to be redeemed?\n\nThis song is absolutely beautiful and a reminder when we are feeling down,oppressed, unworthy or that we can't face another day, we are redeemed and, \"yes,\" we can get up, remember we are redeemed. We can be renewed and grateful and walk on in the face of whatever trials we face.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Good album.  The first half of the album didn't generate as much interest for me as did the last half which I found to be more engaging and interesting.  A nice bit of diversity and some flourish there, from the driving rocker \"To the Wolves\" to the acoustically oriented and affective \"Down\".  Album ender \"Depraved\" is their most adventurous song, and their longest, but it pales in comparison to some of their other last tracks.\n\nThis is most definitely a \"poppier\" Anberlin.  They're moving far away from their new wave punk influences (though they are still there in tracks like \"We Owe This To Ourselves\") and toward emotionally swooning ballads (like \"Take Me As You Found Me\").  Fans of their first three albums might have a hard time with this one.  Me?  I like the catchy nuances and production found here.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Jazmine Sullivan's voice jumps out at you every time she sings a note! It is rich and very strong, even on uptempo tracks. There are not many female R&B vocalists of her era who can hold a candle to her voice. Compare her voice to someone like Jennifer Hudson. Of course, Jennifer's voice is overall stronger, but I said that in order to paint a picture for it to be understood just how strong her voice is.\n\n\"Love Me Back\" is a good album. I graded it 3.5 out of 5. The only song that sticks out in my mind after listening, though, is \"Good Enough.\" I heard this song one time and fell in love with it. That song? Now that is what I call music! The production is wonderful (Prince's \"Beautiful Ones\" is sampled), her vocals are great and the lyrics are quite profound. The message is if a man will not love you right, another man will be happy to. It's a beautiful, quality track and the standout moment of the 11 tracks. Missy Elliot can be found hollering randomly on the album. I really wish she and Jermaine Dupri would stop doing that. Enough is enough. \"Don't Make Me Wait\" has a great uptempo beat. It's another track inspired by the one and only Prince.\n\nNothing groundbreaking or especially innovative here beside her creative lyrics. I can say I really enjoy listening to the words in her songs because her lyrics have something a lot of music of today lacks and that is content. It's a cool listen.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"Don't Make Me Wait\"\n2. \"You Get On My Nerves\"\n3. \"Good Enough\"\n4. \"10 Seconds\"\n5. \"Excuse Me\"","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"\"Back to Birth\" is a strong release by Jackie Greene.  Somehow, he's got put into a niche as \"Americana,\" but his melodic songwriting shines through.  On this release, I can't find any songwriter credits, but I assume these are all Greene originals.  Coming off his great association with Joan Osborne in the band Trigger Hippy, it's nice to have some of his recent solo work.  The opener \"Silver Lining\" has a pretty midtempo melody with Jackie's vocals expressive and clear, \"Don't think that the life we're living is easy; We travel around; Our feet don't touch the ground.\"  The second track, \"Now I Can See for Miles\" may be the best on the set with its catchy hook and Reinhardt Weis's drums punching through between guitar jabs, \"Like telescopes in search of hope, I was mystified by the way she spoke.\"  \"Trust Somebody\" is also a stellar Greene classic with a touch of country swagger mixed with tangy blues and Jackie's piano building up to the addictive chorus, \"When you're out of your mind, broken & blind, look at yourself; Do you like what you see? If you want something else, you better trust somebody.\"  \"Light Up Your Window\" & \"You Can't Have Bad Luck All the Time\" are also gems.  Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I am willing to bet that 99 percent of you do not have anything like this album in your collections. I have well over a thousand albums in my collection (I haven't counted), and I didn't.  Like me, you may have classical piano, and jazz piano, and pop piano, and even easy-listening piano, but you probably don't have this. We still have piano bars, we have dueling pianos, we have tasteful and unobtrusive pianos played in museum atria, but we no longer have piano music as it's own art form. We don't have piano houses with rollicking piano music. We don't have drawing rooms where people gathering around a well-performed piano piece is the only entertainment in the home. Allen Toussaint can take you back to those times. You may not even know that you want to go, but trust me, you do. Toussaint pours his lifetime of musical accomplishment into this album, and makes it seem effortless. He plays with class and style and an unerring ear for what is musically right. His fingers tickle the ivories and your ear. There is a delightful diversity of musical styles represented on the album... some lean toward pop, some toward light classical, others are barrel house blues straight out of New Orleans. Invite Allen to come play in your home... this extraordinary and yet at the time unassuming and relaxed album belongs in the collection of every true \"music lover.\"","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"The new Katy Perry album is another great pop production but the overall mood is significantly different from her last two albums.  Prism also doesn't have too many contenders that look like they will be immediate #1 hit singles on Billboard (like Teenage Dream did).  I would say the best options for chart hits on this album are the initially released promo track \"Dark Horse\",\"Birthday\" and \"This is How We Do\" which I actually dislike due to the boring monotonous chorus but would probably be a hit on radio today.  This album has themes of redemption, strength, overcoming, inspiration and there are more than a few religious references.\n\nMy favorites tracks which all happen to have an air of feel-good anthems are:\n\n\"Double Rainbow\"\n\"It Takes Two\"\n\"Roar\"\n\"By The Grace of God\"\n\nThe feel-good accessible fun pop tracks are:\n\"Birthday\"\n\"Walking on Air\"\n\"This Is How We Do\"\n\"International Smile\"\n\"Dark Horse\"\n\nI also want to call out \"Spiritual\" - it has elements of 90's Moby, EMF's \"Unbelievable\" and U2's \"Mysterious Ways.\"  It's a pretty awesome track with really airy ethereal vocals from Katy.  \"Legendary Lovers\" also has a unique middle eastern pop rock sound so definitely worth checking out.\n\nThe remaining tracks are standard pop tracks which don't standout to me and will most likely not stay on my ipod for too long.  Im somewhat confused by how they chose which tracks were going to be on the deluxe version and also confused by why \"Unconditionally\" was chosen as second single.  It's a good song but will be surprised if it even becomes a top 10 hit for Katy much less a number 1.","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"Just last weekend I saw Toro Y Moi in concert (more on that later), and ahead of that I had been listening to this album, the 3rd album from Toro Y Moi (the studio one-man band from Chaz Bundick). I became a fan of him with the release of the previous album, 2011's \"Underneath the Pine\".\n\n\"Anything In Return\" (13 tracks; 52 min.) starts off with an immediately inviting pick-me-up \"Harm In Change\" and an equally charming \"Say That\", both of which signal a continuation towards the more dance-oriented songs found on \"Underneath the Pine\" and also the \"Freaking Out\" EP. But then things slow down and Bundick turns more melancholic and reflective on tracks like \"So Many Details\" and \"Cola\". In fact, the album stays mostly in that same mid-tempo groove, and somehow it works quite nicely. \"Never Matter\" towards the end of the album is one last song in which the dance-along factor is increased again. In all, I am enjoying this album quite a bit. Perfect for these summer days!\n\nLast weekend at the FYF in Los Angeles, Toro Y Moi (live a full band, not just Bundick) put on a fantastic 50 min. set before a wildly enthusiastic (and massive) crowd. Bundick & Co. brought a great mix of old and new songs, featuring about 4 or 5 songs from this album (including \"Say That\", \"Rose Quartz\", and \"Never Matter\"). I must say that live these songs sounded more massive than anything you hear on the album, and their set was one of the festival's highlights for me, without a doubt, I enjoyed it a ton! Meanwhile \"Anything In Return\" is highly recommended!","classification":4,"fold":3}

Wayward lead-singer, dead founding member, not to mention pretty much being inactive for the best part of two decades, you could be forgiven for thinking that things didn't bode well for this comeback. However, if you wrote a wishlist for what Ratt HAD to do to get you to listen to them again, then they definitely fulfill it on 'Infestation': Great production, crunchy riffs, can't-get-it-out-of-your-head catchiness, tasteful shredding, Pearcy's sneer - all present and correct. Thankfully, they now have a producer ( Elvis Baskette ), who is obviously a fan. He knows the limitations of the Pearcy 'voice', and makes sure it's upfront and unapologetic. You hear Pearcy, and you hear the 'Ratt Sound'. So you get the patented attitude and swagger. Stand out tracks include \"eat me up alive\", \"best of me\",\"a little too much\", and \"lost weekend\" is so utterly brilliant, that it already stands out as a Ratt classic, rubbing shoulders with such bad boys as \"round & round\", \"you're in love\", \"lay it down\" and \"nobody rides for free\".

{"text":"Simple yet profound; folksy yet churchy; slow and solemn yet fast and romantic; age-old prayerfulness and witness yet a fresh, urgent call of faith, hope, and love . . . Crowder's new solo attempt and hit single it aptly \"I Am.\"  Poetic, harmonious, beautiful, and praiseworthy.  Picture Peter fearing drowning, in worry, in sadness, in embarrassment.  Picture the men and women lamenting in exile in the Psalms and Old Testament.  \"Lord, where are you!\" so many biblical witnesses asked in prayer.  \"Lord, where are you?  Help me!\" we often say in the storms of our modern lives.  \"I am holding onto you\/In the middle of the storm, I am holding on\/I Am.\"  Creative, graceful, and a wonderful witness to faith--it deserves multiple movie spots, which it may never get.  If I were a multi-millionaire movie producer up against secular Hollywood, I'd invest more than a couple books in giving Crowder's \"I Am\" its place in this world.  On the radio, on our lips, in our ears, hearts, minds, and souls, calling us to the Lord who saves us.  \"Love like this sets our hearts on fire,\" sings Crowder.  Amen.  -Pentecost 2014","classification":5,"fold":3}

This album for me doesn't even come close to their last album, in fact, their self titled album was much better than this. I honestly thought this was generic at best, nothing like they have released before. The opener wasn't even an energetic track like ''Time of My Life, Train, Right Where I Belong, etc''\n\nThis for me is a sad wait for a band I had high hopes in coming back strong after losing Henderson and Harrell.

{"text":"It's been fourteen years - entirely too long - since songwriter Matraca Berg recorded her last commercially released album, 1997's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sunday-Morning-to-Saturday-Night\/dp\/B000005AZF\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sunday Morning to Saturday Night<\/a>. Though she's never found the chart-topping success as a singer that she's scored as a writer (having penned \"Wrong Side of Memphis\" for Trisha Yearwood, \"Wild Angels\" for Martina McBride, \"You Can Feel Bad\" for Patty Loveless and \"Strawberry Wine\" for Deana Carter, among dozens of other hit singles and album tracks), critics and fans have treasured her original performances. Unfortunately, when her former label (Rising Tide) closed shop in 1998, her last album found critical accolades that went unmatched by sales, and she returned to writing (including songs for the theatrical production&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Good-Ol-Girls\/dp\/B003W5QJEQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Good Ol' Girls<\/a>), live performance and background singing.\n\nBerg's latest set shows off her talent for writing deeply personal songs that touch intimate, individual memories in each listener. Her songwriting craft and soulful performances suggest a modern-day Carole King, but one flowering at a time when music discovery has become highly balkanized. The funnel of country radio has narrowed further in the last decade, and the channels of indie promotion have simultaneously multiplied and fragmented. Berg's songs have always been thoughtful, but her lyrics have become more allusive and her performances more subtle and introspective, necessitating longer exposure than a ten-second Pandora needle-drop or snippets woven into an NPR review. Whether her new album gets the hearing it deserves will depend in large part on word-of-mouth from her fans.\n\nWriting in mid-life, the youthful optimism and wistful nostalgia of her earlier songs have taken a backseat to more realistic endings. The album's title track is a somber elegy for her grandfather's farm, one in which the golden hues of yesterday share space with the overgrowth and rust of today. The Hollywood dreams of a small town girl in \"Silver and Glass\" reveal themselves as fading illusions as age presents its inevitable transformations in the mirror. Even Berg's beloved cherubs, which served as guardians in 1995's \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Wild-Angels\/dp\/B00136Q5J0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wild Angels<\/a>\" (a chart-topper for Martina McBride), have matured into escorts for a bittersweet final journey in \"Racing the Angels.\" Only 2002's \"Oh Cumberland\" (originally recorded with Emmylou Harris for the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Will-the-Circle-Be-Unbroken-Vol-3\/dp\/B00006I4YE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Will the Circle Be Unbroken, Vol. 3<\/a>, revels unabashedly in the warmth of memories.\n\nBerg contemplates the attraction of dangerous liaisons in \"You and Tequila\" (co-written with Deana Carter, and recently released as a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/single\/dp\/B004TBWWIO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">single<\/a>&nbsp;by Kenny Chesney and Grace Potter), but when vulnerability turns into deceit, a serial cheater's dalliances catch up to him in the foreboding \"Ode to Billy Joe\" styled \"Your Husband's Cheating on Us.\" Berg's a deft author of characters, including a battered woman taking a stand and a mother coping with the inexplicable loss of a soldier son; but her best character is often herself. She closes with the ballad \"A Cold, Rainy Morning in London in June,\" evoking her longing for home and her comfort in having a home to long for. It's a contemplative, yet passionate finish to an album woven from multiple strands of deep emotion and strong expression. [2011 hyperbolium dot com]","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Where to begin?\n\nTSO has been a vital and important part of our annual Christmas celebration since my children were small. Either playing in the background or bringing down the walls, the orchestra has become to us what Bing Crosby was to my parent's generation.\n\nIt has always been a shame that the Christmas songs of TSO did not play so well the remainder of the year.  Christmas Canon Rock somehow lost its magic in the sweltering heat of summer.\n\nThat has just changed. After five years in the making, Night castle is TSO's attempt to bring its sound and poetry to old and new fans and to do it without the usual seasonal charm.\n\nI should learn not to underestimate this group of writers and musicians. Every time that I do the result is a pleasant surprise. Night Castle is no exception.\n\nIn one word, it is brilliant. Night Castle is a throwback to the grand rock operas of the 1970s but still moves steadily onward with the trademark TSO mix of guitar driven rock and orchestral movements.\n\nThe story behind the CD's theme reads like a good book. It is impossible to put down.\n\nI'm sure that there are some who will not like Night Castle. Fans of TSO or music with blazing guitars will not be disappointed.\n\nMy only advice is to skip the mp3 download and buy the CD. It is worth it - 2CDs for $9.99. If not for any other reason, you get extra songs including one titled \"Nutrocker.\" Everybody can use a little Nutrocker in their lives.\n\nIf you must have the downloaded version, you can go on the TSO website and read the CD's full story from start to finish.

{"text":"Katy Perry is a guilty pleasure for several reasons. First, her music has a 'corporate pop' manufactured quality--you know, where it seems that producers and record execs have more creative control than the actual artist. Second, Katy Perry's rise to fame is littered with calculated steps to make it into everyone's homes. Third, the songwriting lacks depth most of the time, only occasionally hitting an emotional resonance on a song like \"By The Grace Of God\". Fourth, at age 29, who is her target audience? 13 year olds? 18 year olds? 21 year olds? It can't be much higher than that, except, maybe, for Volvo driving soccer moms?\n\nThat being said, \"Prism\" offers up Perry's most mature batch of cookies this side of Betty Crocker. If the confectionery of \"Teenage Dream\" with its 8 hit singles wasn't enough, then here's some more on \"Prism\". I have all three of Perry's albums (I wouldn't dream of buying her CCM 2001 debut). If you thought her last two albums were crude in places (\"I Kissed A Girl\", \"Ur So Gay\", \"Peacock\", \"Circling The Drain\") then you will be happy to know that's pretty much gone here on \"Prism\" with one exception being \"Birthday\" where there is an f-bomb. Yes, it does appear that Perry is at least attempting a stab at maturity this time around (it's about time you know, she is 29 after all).\n\nBut like her previous two albums, \"Prism\" has some string of duds like \"Walking On Air\", \"Unconditionally\" which are average, and \"Dark Horse\" and \"This Is How We Do\" which are nearly cringe-worthy, topped off with \"International Smile\" which is arguably average as well.\n\nBut, the album opens with \"Roar\", \"Legendary Lovers\" and \"Birthday\" which are all solid tracks lyrically and musically. Strangely, after the string of so-so tracks the end of the album picks up where it started with five more solids tracks in the form of \"Ghost\", \"Love Me\", \"This Moment\", \"Double Rainbow\" and \"By The Grace Of God\". I opted out of the three bonus tracks because 13 is enough Katy Perry for me without getting a sugar hangover.\n\nStill, if you asked me, and I know you didn't, I'd say that \"Teenage Dream\" is the best of her past three albums. \"Prism\" would be next, and \"One Of The Boys\" would be next and, well, without even listening to it, her CCM debut would be rock bottom for me.\n\nAnd that's one final thing that's amusing about Katy Perry and her 'new' music. If you read her biography she was raised in a strictly religious home without exposure to popular secular music. I can't imagine what that's like because I was listening to secular music since time out of mind. And isn't it funny, once again, that another young woman starts of squeaky clean, doing CCM, fails, comes back 'reimagined' and is lewd and crude and even obnoxious, and claims this is the 'real' me. Katy Perry Hudson is a paradox, a mental conundrum. At least she didn't become AS sexual as say Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears or Lady Gaga, or for that matter, even Madonna. She's managed to retain some semblance of chastity. So, what are we to believe? Is \"Prism\" the real Katy Perry, less lewd than the one who sang \"I Kissed A Girl\" and \"Peacock\"? \"Prism\" seems a crossroads of sorts and a possible future for more mature music to come. Perhaps this is a new beginning?\n\nHere's how \"Prism\" compares with her previous works:\n\n2001 Katy Hudson: (No thank you to CCM)\n2008 One Of The Boys: Two and a Half Stars\n2010 Teenage Dream: Three and a Half Stars\n2013 Prism: Three Stars","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"Yes it's short and yes it is over before you know it but Rob Zombie's sixth studio album \"The Electric Warlock Acid Witch Satantic Orgy\" still delivers all of Zombie's trademarks such as horror movie samples, big choruses, crunching riffs and big sounding drums. The majority of the songs all clock in at under 3 minutes which means nothing outstays its welcome.\n\nZombie is now helped by having the same line up as 2013 \"Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor\" and now makes it more of a band affair than a solo album. Some of the highlights include the Les Claypool sounding \"Everyones F****** in a UFO\", \"The Life And Times Of A Teenage Rock God\" and \"In The Age Of The Consegrated Vampire We All Get High\". There is various short intervals throughout the album and this is something Zombie has done throughout his previous albums. One again John 5's guitar playing is superb. The album closer \"Wurdlak\" is the exception that it lasts for over 5 minutes and builds up slowly and closes with an atmospheric piano sound.\n\nOne thing always guaranteed with Rob Zombie albums is quality artwork and a CD booklet that is actually worthwhile looking through especially in this day and age where there is usually a message to go to the bands official website for album info. If you liked Rob Zombie before then chances are you will like this album.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"I've been a fan of Chapman's since 1988's \"Fast Car\". I have ignored most music critics opinions of Chapman's music over the years. On \"Telling Stories\" I felt that Tracy slips a little. For some  reason the music isn't as compelling as her 1988 debut or 1989's  \"Crossroads\". It also doesn't seem to have some of the great  moments achieved on 1992's \"Matters Of The Heart\" or 1995's  \"New Beginning\". There are a few gems here like  \"Devotion\", \"The Only One\" and \"First Try\"  which finish the cd, but most of the other songs are rather unmemorable.  Gone is the energy that Chapman had in such songs as \"Talking About A  Revolution\", \"Crossroads\", \"Born To Fight\",  \"Bang, Bang, Bang\" and \"Smoke and Ashes\". I like it  when Chapman surprises by adding a few twists to her music like 1988's  \"Mountains 'O' Things\" and \"She's Got Her Ticket\",  1989's \"Crossroads\" and \"Born To Fight\", 1992's  \"Dreaming On A World\" and 1995's \"Give Me One Reason\".  Here she has \"It's OK\" containing a hip-hop drum loop which is  refreshing. However, it doesn't make up for the monotony that covers most  of the songs on this cd.

{"text":"After what felt like a long wait, I finally got my act together and bought Robyn's Body Talk, which is basically a marriage between a compilation album and an actually LP. I was afraid on my listen that Robyn wouldn't be able to top her sleeper hit dance record \"Robyn\". I am glad to report that I was wrong. \"Body Talk\" is a collect of progressive and innovative dance and electronica hits. Robyn and friends (pop music deities like Max Martin and Klaus Ahlund) continue to create great music with emotional lyrics. Ignoring Body Talk parts 1 thru etc, \"Body Talk\" captures Robyn's hard work. Gems for me include \"Dancing on my own\", \"In My Eyes\", & \"Star 4-Ever\". This is a great album to play during a workout or for that black light enchanted dance floors. My only gripe is that the album runs a little long, and there is a tendency for the songs to sound the same. There isn't enough switch in synths and bass from some track to track. Dare I say there is a point where an album can have enough techno.","classification":4,"fold":3}

Really...is there any reason NOT to buy this?).\n\nUnlike many of the other inexpensive classical downloads one finds on Amazon, the Vanguard series features artists that one may actually have heard of before. This particular download features the English Chamber Orchestra, the Yale String Quartet and others in performances that are maybe just a few clicks under what's considered top drawer these days. Indeed, many of these recordings WERE the recommended recordings back in the day where the competition was a little slimmer.\n\nMany of these recordings still hold up. I bought this download to fill my iPhone with traveling music, where I accept a lower sound quality compared to listening to CDs at home.

{"text":"Ugly Kid Joe first burst on to the scene with their breakout hit \"Everything About You\" from their 1991 EP \"As Ugly As They Wanna Be\" a song which would launch the band in to the mainstream, the iconic video of the band playing on the beach would go on to get heavy rotation on MTV(when they actually played videos) even during the height of grunge it was guaranteed that video would only be a few videos away from its next airing, the resulting album \"America's Least Wanted\" continued the bands success and would feature another successful hit in the shape of a cover of the Harry Chapin song \"Cats In The Cradle\". The band would go on to release two further albums 1995's heavier sounding \"Menace To Sobriety\" which was followed a year later by 1996's \"Motel California\". However neither album could replicate their earlier success and the band would call a halt in 1997. The band quietly reformed in 2010 without much notice from the music press who once drooled over the band, now 2 years after reforming they are back on the road touring and have released a new EP \"Stairway To Hell\"\n\nThankfully it's the 1997 line up that has reformed as it includes drummer Shannon Larkin who joined the band in 1994 and was in part responsible for their heavier sound on the later albums. The album continues the bands heavier trend as it opens with the first single from the album \"Devil's Paradise\" which has frontman Whitfield Crane delivering a sinister sounding vocal over heavy sounding guitars, the song might be heavy but it does have a nice funk edge to it as well. On the Track \"I'm Alright\" Crane summons his inner Bon Scott towards the middle of the song as the band deliver an AC\/DC-esque breakdown, it shows that Crane has always had an underappreciated vocal delivery.\n\nPossibly the highlight of the album is the track \"No One Survives\" which starts out slow and quiet before a full on rock assault begins, the song strikes a perfect balance between quiet and loud. \"Love Ain't True\" which features Fishbone vocalist Angelo Moore as well as Dirty Walt who provide to give the song a real funk sound. The final track on the EP is \"Another Beer\" which is almost a throwback to \"Busy Bee\"(from \"America's Least Wanted\") but with a country feel to it.\n\nSo while Ugly Kid Joe might never reach the heights of their earlier success it's great to have them back as they were always refreshingly a band who never took themselves too serious whilst at the same time proving that they're a lot more that than \"the guys on the beach that hate everything\".","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Just this weekend I saw the documentary \"Amy\" in the theater (more on that later). Afterwards I just had to dig up my Amy Winehouse CDs, which I hadn't listened to in forever. \"At the BBC\" is a CD\/DVD combo that was released in November, 2012 (just in time for the Christmas shopping season of course--as was the previous year's \"Lioness\").\n\nThe CD (12 tracks; 48 min.), called \"BBC Sessions\", provides a smorgasbord of various live appearances, starting with the excellent big band-reminding intro on \"Know You Now\" (from Leicester Summer Sundae 2004). Amy's voice is strong and confident throughout these carefully selected tracks. T In the Park 2004 provides 3 songs, including a very nice \"In My Bed\". The sequencing of this collection is sometimes a head-scratcher (for example, all 3 T In the Park tunes are together, but the 3 tunes from Jo Wiley Live Lounge 2007 are scattered all over for no apparent reason, etc.). It doesn't take away from the ultimate quality of the songs, though, that's how strong they are. Perhaps my favorite on there is the reggae-dripping \"Just Friends\" (from Big Band Special 2009), just delightful. The latest recording on here is \"Love Is a Losing Game\" (from Jools Holland 2009), with that chilling chorus \"And now the final frame\/Love is a losing game\", wow. Even though by then Amy was already is serious trouble health-wise, she sounds pretty darn good on this tune. In all, this is a very nice collection of live tunes, showcasing Amy at the top of her game. (As an aside, I had the good fortune of seeing Amy perform at Coachella in April, 2007. She played in one of the (smaller) tents, before a small but appreciative crowd. She looked and sounded fantastic. Unforgettable.)\n\nThe DVD (50 min.), called \"Amy Winehouse - The Day She Came To Dingle\" is an interesting item. The performance from Amy and the interview with Amy was shot in December, 2006 (just after \"Back to Black\" came out) for a BBC program called \"Other Voices\", and was recorded in Dingle, Ireland. In the interview, Amy discusses her influences (Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, Soweto Kinch, Thelonious Monk, Ray Charles, etc.) and we are treated to video footage from those performers as well. But this also includes more recent comments from various people (the head of Universal Records, etc.) that was clearly shot after Amy's passing away. As to the actual performances from Amy, there's sadly enough only 6 songs, but what a beauty they are. It's just Amy with bass (Dale Davis) and guitar (Banerjee), allowing clear focus and attention on Amy's singing, and boy, she just sounds fantastic. Very nice addition to the CD.\n\nAs to the documentary, \"Amy\" was directed by the same guy who made the outstanding documentary called \"Senna\" some 3-4 ago on the life and times of F-1 driver Ayrton Senna, and here as well, he delivers a top-notch documentary that will enrage and shock and sadden you. Given complete access to all video and audio archives by the Winehouse family (read: Amy's dad Mitch), Mitch now has disavowed this documentary (because he looks more interested in Amy's money than Amy's well-being). Family bickering aside, there is performance footage in the documentary that will make your jaw drop to the floor, the most amazing for me being when Amy is filmed while's she's recording the song \"Back to Black\", we see\/hear her mostly a-cappella while she has headphones on, with an arm casually on a chair, and after the song Amy commenting to no-one in particular \"that was a bit heavy, no?\" (it turned out to be the take that ended u on the album). \"Amy\" is a MUST-SEE!","classification":5,"fold":3}

I am 52 years old and I love this kind of music!  Although I liked it, I think it's much better than their last CD called Red Velvet Car from two years ago!  And you might want to do yourself this little favor and pick up a copy of the CD at Best Buy because they have an exclusive three bonus tracks (Beautiful Broken, Two Silver Rings and Zingara) that makes a total of thirteen songs instead of the normal ten!

{"text":"This Is Gonna Hurt is the soundtrack to compliment the book by the same name released about a month ago. First and foremost, this is an AMAZING album. The songs are well written, the lyrics deep and meaningful while also being twisted and dark, and the production is crisp and fresh. Nikki Sixx is the driving creative force behind most of the music, and he dives deep into meandering emotions through epic melodies. The result is an intriguing mix of sounds and passions. Words that come to mind when listening are raw and powerful. His music captures all of his creative qualities: his love, rage, optimism, darkness, and determinism. The title track is a great way to start off the album and features some killer bass playing. \"Lies of the Beautiful\" has catchy riffs and amazing vocals, and tackles contradictions in society with Sixx urging listeners to look beneath the skin. \"Live Forever\" delivers with a sonic boom and features an incredible guitar solo. \"Sure Feels Right\" is a stunning change to the overall sound: the guitar and bass are soothing and the vocals entwine perfectly with the music. \"Skin\" shows Nikki's deeper side and is a statement about beauty without prejudice. There is not one filler song on the album, and listening closely to the music and lyrics will definitely make you react, which is what I think Nikki had in mind.

I guess what I wanted was the RKelly who made all those classic bump & grind songs, & before some hater responds by saying I should stick with the autotune or trash r&b, which I never knew existed, crap or some other artist, one poster named Trey Songz, which I disagree with & whom I like, so you really don't have to bash other artists just to make some point.  All I am saying is this is what I have come to expect from Kelly, & this cd caught me off guard.  That's really what I want to hear from him, but i am all for artists improving their sound.  I will give this another play through & see if it grows on me.  Based on the reviews, it's clear many of the other posters love the cd, more power to ya, everyone is entitled to their opinion.","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"Like all Bach Guild 'Big Box' collections, this is a terrific value - in this case, 14 hours and 6 minutes (according to my iTunes tracklist) and 184 tracks of music, 14 of Haydn's symphonies plus a good selection of his other works - string quartets, masses, divertimento. Haydn wrote so much music that it's not reasonable to expect anything close to 'completeness' in such a collection, but what is offered here is a very good sampling and a good starting point for anyone exploring Haydn for the first time.\n\nThe point of these collections, in my opinion, is not that the absolute qualify of the music is necessarily the best. Classical collectors and serious Mahler listeners will have other performances they prefer, and nobody is claiming that this set or similar sets are the top rated performances of this music.\n\nI value these Bach Guild sets because of the value they represent, both for experienced collectors but especially for those who would like to dip their toes into classical music to see what it's all about. It is extraordinary, really, to be able to build a collection of fine music for such a reasonable price.\n\nThen, after learning the music, becoming more familiar with it, there will be the natural desire to explore other performances. For those listeners, they can go further and obtain other downloads, or really 'splurge' and buy more 'normal' priced CD collections.\n\nRegardless, this is a terrific value, and the performances are fully worth listening to. I've had this particular Bach Guild set since purchasing it in 2013, in fact, and it's about time I posted a review here to express my opinion on the worthiness of this set!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I must confess, I have never had the privilege of listening to the album.  So, I can't judge it truly.  So, I'll have to rank it based on one song!  That being said, \"Love won't let me wait\" ranks up near the top in the category of romantic R&B\/Soul ballads.  The year 1975 was a good year for romantic (black) music.  \"Love won't let me wait\" was NO exception, as it's a great song.\n\nAs this CD is an import, it's expensive ($38.99 as of 12\/01\/2006).  Third parties have cheaper (though not much).  This is going to force me to wait.  Oh well...(sigh)...Five stars...\n\n**This update as of 05\/12\/2008!  Please note that the download that you can purchase of \"Love Won't Let Me Wait\" is for the 'single' version (under 4 minutes!).  The actual full-length song is between 5 to 6 minutes!  That means you are purchasing the single version!  So, beware!!!!**","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"You know you're a book nerd when you download this song not because you were a Bruce Springsteen fan in your youth, but because the song's lyrics are a recurring theme in the Koushun Takami novel \"Battle Royale\" (a fantastic book, by the way).  That book got me curious about the song itself, and so I gave it a listen... and ended up enjoying it enough to go ahead and purchase it on Amazon.  If it takes a Japanese thriller novel to get me into an American rock icon, well, there are stranger ways to be introduced to a new favorite song, right?\n\n\"Born To Run\" is a lively and upbeat song, not afraid to pour on the sound yet still staying musical -- sometimes a band sacrifices good instrumentation in favor of noise, but this song stays on key and great to listen to.  Bruce's voice isn't what I'd call excellent, but it has a worn and gravely edge that grows on you as you listen.  And his lyrics, though occasionally grim (\"suicide machines?\"), stay hopeful and expectant, looking towards a bright future despite hard circumstances.\n\nI can appreciate why Springsteen is such a well-loved musician, and though this is the only song of his that I listen to regularly, it's fantastic and makes me want to check out the rest of his work.  Thanks, \"Battle Royale...\"","classification":5,"fold":3}

They have done an amazing job of taking their talents, in vocals and instrumentals, and combining them with synthesized tech to create something that few were used to listening. And now almost everyone knows their name. Their sound is kind of otherworldly, and though the lyrics are not the cleverest, the feeling one gets from heir songs allow them to sink into their imagination. And thats what makes this album so good.\n\nHighlights are Radioactive, Its Time, Demons, Amsterdam, Hear Me, Every Night, Bleeding Out, and Nothing Left To Say.\nThere is not a single song I dislike.\n\nBreakdown:\nRadioactive: 5\nTiptoe: 4\nIt's Time: 4.5\nDemons: 5\nOn Top Of The World: 3\nAmsterdam: 4.5\nHear Me: 4\nEvery Night: 4.5\nBleeding Out: 4.5\nUnderdog: 3\nNothing Left To Say: 4","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"The Rob Zombie classic, Living Dead Girl is actually a great song created from pieces of several different old classic horror movies. The title is named after a film made in 1982 by Jean Rollin. The first line in the song you hear speaking is a clip from a movie trailer from the film \"Lady Frankenstein\". Many other lines in the song are also taken from movies such as \"The Last House on the Left\", \"Daughters of Darkness\", \"Dr. Goldfoot\" and \"Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS\". The music video is really a sight to see, having clips from the old silent 1920's film \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\". While the song sounds dark, there's a lot of humor in the video and nods to classic films from long ago. Many people just hear it as another song, but it's really a great compilation of film quotes from classic movies.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Music for the violin is the indulged child of the Bach Guild catalog. Seymour Solomon, the originator (along with Maynard Solomon) of Vanguard\/Bach Guild played the violin and as the label grew, music of the violin appears throughout the catalog. Violin repertoire never played the role of the North Star (that would be the music of Bach), but it played the role of a sweet indulgence, like a lovely Viennese dessert.\nIf Seymour Solomon had been led by his love the violin, The Bach Guild might have been a vastly different label. But he seemed to keep his love of the instrument and his repertoire choices separate  for the most part. The devotion to the violin appears at the margins of the catalog. Certainly no catalog that boasts the performances of David Oistrakh, Mischa Elman, Alexander Schneider and Joseph Szigeti can be truly labelled a marginal catalog. But as we have seen, Seymour Solomon could become slightly unbalanced when repertoire was involved (and occasionally, artists). He always kept his obsessions controlled by a tight logic  if there was a need in the marketplace, he would indulge it. But the violinists involved with the labels fit the definition of independent label and the role such an institution should play  but just barely.\nThe margins? What does that mean? It means that in a world dictated by simple math, The Bach Guild rarely made recordings that weren't going to survive in a classical music marketplace. Except where the violin was concerned, there was some leeway, and if chamber music is included, a considerable amount of leeway. You can sense a small feeling of if Im going to do this, Im going to use this as a chance to sit down next to some of the greatest violinists in the world and make some recordings. Nowhere else is that emotion indulged in the catalog  where it could have been used to include the great pianists of the era, or singers, is isnt. But violinists? Sureheres have a cookie\/recording session.\nSeymours love of the violin and violinists is particularly defined by his recordings of Joseph Szigeti and Mischa Elman. Both violinists prospered in an era where their performances were at the mainstream of musical society. Elmans career was also punctuated with tremendous success in the area of record sales (his Meditation from Thais was one of the most popular recordings in the world until the late 1930s). Such a sales history had to be appealing, even after Elmans contract with a major label had been allowed to expire in the 1950s. Bach Guild\/Vanguard snapped up Elman and created a satisfying collection of recitals and orchestral recordings, many of which are featured here.\nIn Joseph Szigeti, Seymour Solomon may have found a musician whom he wished to emulate but since his own musical abilities were vastly outclassed by Szigeti, Seymours appreciation for Szigetis tremendous interpretive skills certainly lit the fire of Seymours inquisitive nature. Still a musician who draws strong opinions on both sides, Szigetis Vanguard recordings show a depth of understanding that certainly explains why he is a thinking mans virtuoso.\nThe David Oistrakh recordings were among the violinists first recordings released in the United States. Seymours strong stance against the HUAC and embrace of Communist artists like Pete Seeger and Paul Robeson gave him significant inroads into the mysterious world of Soviet commerce circa 1955, and Vanguard was able to debut recordings of Gilels, Mravinsky, Shafran and Oistrakh to the US and Canadian market.\nSprinkled in are some very tasty goodies long unreleased  either from the vaults or in some cases, from CDs long ago deleted and never revived. Jan Tomasow was one of the first violinists from the Vienna State Opera Orchestras and he pops up quite often in the 1950s Bach Guild recordings. While no devotee of the burgeoning early music scene in Vienna, he did make a lovely recording of baroque violin sonatas, beautifully accompanied by Anton Heiller. Later in this collection Tomasow appears again on the opposite side  performing Faures violin sonata. (His Debussy performance will soon be issued on in a Debussy box on Bach Guild.)","classification":5,"fold":3}

Many love songs but so the music is so damn moody and catchy.  There is always a bit of clever British humor to there style which I have always enjoyed. I like the first single \"Winner\" on the remix 8 mins long over the radio single, it has much more electronics and mood. \"Leaving\", the second single is sure to bring back the older fans, as well as songs \"Memory of the future\", \"A face like that\", \"your early stuff\", and \"Requiem in denim and leoparskin\", this one's a proper comeback to those that loved their late 80's, early 90's period.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"\"Soul Meets Body\" was originally released in 2005 as the first single from the band's full-length&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/PLANS\/dp\/B0011Z933S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">PLANS<\/a>.  It's easily one of the best songs on the album, but not because PLANS is mediocre; \"Soul Meets Body\" is one of Death Cab for Cutie's best.  Ben Gibbard's lyrics border on poetry here, and his voice finds a place between mellow crooning and urgent singing.  The band's instrumentation is just as interesting as the lyrics: use of slight electronics, keys, mandolins.  The final line: \"a melody softly soaring through my atmosphere\" might as well be describing the song itself.  If you are looking for one song to convince you to listen to the band, \"Soul Meets Body\" might as well be it.  Fantastic song.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Is there anything musical that Bob Dylan can't put his hand to that doesn't confound & amaze. Unlike some of the other reviewers here, I was not aware of the content of Shadows Of The Night, and so it came as a complete surprise - and what a pleasant one at that. I've been a Dylan fan for most of my life, & I've learned over the years, never to take him for granted, musically; that each new release will have its surprises & each will, in its own way, offer something different to delight. His last outing, Tempest, was a perfect example of this. But nothing could have prepared me for a collection of 50's easy listening classics that one would normally associate with artists like Sinatra, Bennett, etc. And they are performed perfectly - no rasping voice here, no jumbled pronunciations, just clear & melodic crooning that carries each number flawlessly. My favourite tracks are 'I'm A Fool To Want You', The Night We Called It A Day', & 'That Lucky Old Sun', but honestly, there's not a bad track on the album. So put your feet up, turn down the lights, close your eyes, & either with, or without headphones, allow yourself to be carried back in time. The big question now is, what'll he do next? A reggae album perhaps, or maybe Zydeco? That would be different. Or maybe another album of 50's classics, but this time rock 'n' roll classics. Frankly, after listening to Shadows In The Night, I'm ready for anything.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Rod Stewart has truly outdone himself with this incredibly beautiful set of songs that he sings with all his heart and soul. Sure, I understand that some of his fans who liked his work from days now gone by are disappointed; this is not the Rod Stewart they knew and loved as an artist who gave us some really strong, rockin' tunes like \"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy.\" On the other hand, however, this album is actually selling quite well; and I think it's selling well for two reasons: Rod's fan base has become so diverse that he can successfully release this fifth installment of his \"Great American Songbook\" series; and some fans of Rod Stewart's earlier work also enjoy this type of music. It can happen! Another thing I like about this album is that because Rod does covers on this album, we can hear and enjoy just how fine an interpreter he is of these very special standards. Indeed, there's not a weak track on the disc; Rod sings to perfection and beyond! In addition, with those musical arrangements by people like producer Richard Perry, this is an album to get and enjoy.\n\n\"That Old Black Magic\" provides an auspicious starter number for this album; and it all holds its own very well. Excellent! \"Beyond The Sea\" is equally well done; and I really like other tracks including \"I've Got You Under My Skin;\" \"What a Difference a Day Makes;\" \"I Get a Kick Out of You\" with that especially lush arrangement and Rod's sublime rendition of \"I've Got the World on a String\" with that excellent horn solo.\n\n\"Love Me or Leave Me\" sounds just great; and there are yet more gems in \"My Foolish Heart;\" \"September in the Rain,\" a tune I first heard performed by Dinah Washington; a most passionate treatment of \"Fly Me to the Moon;\" a faultless \"Sunny Side Of The Street\" and the closing track, \"Moon River\" which was one of my mother's favorite songs ever. How that brings back memories!\n\nThis is the strongest installment in Rod's \"Great American Songbook\" CD series; this music is all THAT good. I highly recommend this for any fan of classic pop vocals; and fans of Rod Stewart who enjoy this type of music as well as his previous work will not be disappointed.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I'm breaking a personal rule of mine with this review. I swore that I would never review anything before listening to it completely, with near-full attention - for at least two passes. The very existence of this disk scares such fear into me that I feel that I could never commit to two full listens without developing an intractable opinion, and I admit that my anticipation borders much more closely to fear than holiday cheer. This is Bob Dylan.... (pause required)... Old. Cranky. \"Legendary.\" Impossibly inscrutable...(another pause required)... Bob Dylan. He's been with us - ALL of us - for over forty years. The guy's a Jew, fer Crissakes....(most of the time, anyway) and in the middle of a nearly miraculous career rebirth, he offers us a Christmas album?\n The first track is \"Here Comes Santa Claus.\" I haven't even started to play the CD yet, but if you were me, what would you expect? Do you need to think about it? As I already pointed out, this is Dylan. I haven't played a single note of this disk yet, but a) I'm showing an obvious tendency toward prejudgment, and b) I feel drawn in, like a moth circling a gas lamp. I can't help but wonder how relevant it would be if I were to actually `expose' some of the lyrics. Let's try it:\n \" Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,\n  Right down Santa Claus lane...\"\n Wow. (Another pause is DEFINITELY required now...). As I type this, I'm hearing it for the first time, and I'm dumbfounded. This album's very existence is as improbable as monkeys on the moon. OK, the heck with it. I admit it, I'm suckered in. \"How would\/could Dylan possibly sing this?\", I ask myself. The answer, I'm feeling, is \"Quite well\". Maybe I'm enjoying WAY too much holiday cheer at this exact moment, but Dylan just sang \"Winter Wonderland\" and I felt like drinking egg nog. He sounds forced as he croaks\/sings, \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing,\" but as I listen, I wonder if his interpretation may have value for breaking down religious barriers. Our culture has thoroughly analyzed every syllable that Bob has ever uttered, right? Maybe non-Christians will finally be able to \"interpret\" Christmas songs and apply totally new meanings to them. Or, maybe that's crazy. This album is simply too weird for me to predict how any individual person might react.\n In terms of quantity, it's generous, with fifteen tracks. One of them is \"Little Drummer Boy\". Another is \"Must Be Santa (!!), \" but there's authentic stuff here, too, like \"Adeste Fidelis\" and \"The First Noel.\" The packaging conveys the dichotomy as well as anything possibly could. The cover shot is pure Currier and Ives, but inside is a shot that looks like vintage pin-up girl Betty Page. The music walks the same crooked path. It teases me with flashes of relevance, but then succumbs to stereotypes that border on the psychopathic. \"The Christmas Blues\" is easy to appreciate. \"O Little Town of Bethlehem,\" on the other hand, definitely is not. Once again, for the 50th time, we can't tell if Dylan is toying with us, or if he's simply following some extravagant muse. No Matter. Fifty years from now, my kids will try to capture the spirit of Christmas for their own grandkids. Doing so, they will be armed with Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, Phil Spector....and perhaps Bob Dylan. Christmas albums come and Christmas albums go. Despite everything we throw at it, I believe that the spirit of Christmas will nevertheless survive. As Bob sings, \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\" `B'...or maybe `C', or maybe even `A'. You figure it out.  Tom Ryan","classification":3,"fold":3}

While Puente was very popular in the Latin community, Santana's cover became a hit and helped introduce Puente to a wider audience. On Santana's version of the song, everything, including the guitar wails and keyboards, follow the original music.\nThe voice in the beginning says \"Sabor,\" which is Spanish for \"Flavor.\" (thanks, Jim - Oxnard, CA, for above 2)\nA \"Mulata\" is a woman (\"Mulato\" being a male) of Caucasian European and Negro African descent.

{"text":"Hendrix fans have had to wait a long time for the official release of this May 1968 performance at Gulfstream Park, Miami: 45 years to be exact (sobering to think that had Jimi lived, hed now be a grand old man of 71). At this event for the first time in his short meteoric career, Jimi was placed top-of-the-bill.\n\nSo, whats it like? Well pretty good actually, definitely not scraping the barrel recordings but a superb concert performance delivered with finely mastered sound. This is the Experience trio  i.e. Jimi, Noel and Mitch, performing their early work with gusto, and with the mojo in overdrive.\n\nHighlights: almost all of it. Standout tracks are the opener Hey Joe, Fire, Hear my Train A-Commin, Purple Haze and  especially  Red House which might be his best-ever recorded performance of this blues number. Despite the 1968 date of the concert there is no material from the Electric Ladyland project, but the rain-deluge in the afternoon which put a damper on the event reportedly inspired Jimi to write the song Rainy Day, Dream Away.\n\nYou get 8x tracks from the evening headliner performance (preceded by 2 minutes of messing about and tuning up, titled Introduction) plus additional versions of Fire and Foxey Lady from the afternoons interrupted-by-rain-deluge mini-performance. The 2-gatefold cover sleeve contains a single CD, and a classy 24-page color booklet crammed with numerous rarely-seen photos of the band, around which is wrapped the text of Bob Santellis entertaining (if prolix) essay on the Miami pop festival and background music scene in 1968.\n\nFor the Hendrix aficionado: don't hesitate, buy.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"This complete Ring cycle recorded in Czechoslovakia in 1968 by Austrian conductor Hans Swarowsky really has a lot going for it. I am giving it five stars for a few specific reasons -- especially the sound quality, a few individual performances, and my belief that you will have a hard time finding a Ring that sounds this good for the amazing price of $7.99.\n\nFirst the positives, beyond the price. It sounds absolutely fantastic for an MP3. These are no LP transfers with record needle pops and crackles, it must be direct from the source tape or a quality remastering. It is an early, rich stereo recording, and according to what I have read, it was one of the first opera recordings where each singer got his or her own microphone. The text of the opera is therefore remarkably clear. This makes this recording a fantastic \"study\" version of the Ring, if you are interested in listening to the text and following along in the libretto. There are also some really great individual performances, especially Nadezda Kniplova as Brunnhilde and Rolf Polke as Wotan.\n\nOn the negative side, some vocal performances fall short of the best recordings of the Ring, and the orchestra is good but not always great (I heard what I felt was a clunker every now and again). Overall, this is a very good recording -- but if, say, the Solti Ring is 5 stars, then this one probably merits 3.5 or 4 as a performance. But don't get me wrong. The Solti Ring is hardly a fair comparison for most other recordings anyway.\n\nOn the technical side, bitrates are variable with averages in the 216-269 kbps range. Most tracks are in the 220s and 230s. Total download size is a whopping 1.52 GB for 14 hours and 48 minutes of music.\n\nThere are apparent mistakes on the MP3 files' metadata. It says the recordings are by the \"Grosses Symphonieorchster\". But as far as I know, Swarowsky recorded the Ring only once, and it was with the Czech Philharmonic and the Orchestra of the Prague National Theater. I am, of course, open to correction if anyone knows differently!\n\nThese performances hold their own admirably as a valid interpretation of the Ring, and you'll hardly find better-sounding MP3s. The price is also a valid consideration -- remarkable and welcome. Certainly worthwhile and recommended!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"In the four year period between 1960 thru 1963 Bobby Rydell was pretty hot stuff. As a reigning teen idol Bobby's face was plastered all over the teen magazines and his records were selling like hotcakes. Then in 1964 the phenomenon known as the British Invasion caught everyone by surprise and suddenly stars like Bobby Rydell, Gene Pitney, Roy Orbison and so many others were cast aside. Times had changed and youngsters in the mid sixties were movin' and groovin' to new and different sounds. At about that same time Bobby learned that his longtime record label Cameo-Parkway had been sold and was moving its operations out of his native Philadelphia. His last big hit record for Cameo was 1963's \"Forget Him\" which peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sadly, Bobby Rydell would never have another hit record again.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"If there's one thing I can do without it's a kitschy gimmick.  I understand everybody has one of some sort or another if they want to make a living, but if the gimmick is better than the product, which is often the case, it's insulting.  Which brings us to Ghost.  On this third album, the band has delivered at least musically a great new round of tunes.  Comparatively it melds the first two together - layers of beauty despite the cliched Satanic lyrics, and some rockers with the toughest crunch they've done up to this point.\n  The music is supposedly the work of one of the \"nameless ghouls\", the lead guitarist, according to a recent interview.  This fellow, whomever he is, is a master craftsman of rock the way it ought to be:  more hooks than a fishery in Maine, excellent vocal melodies and a hundred times more listenable than most hard and metal bands out there today.  You can hear the Blue Oyster Cult in the music, who pioneered heavy with melody, and a mix of lots of other bands from bygone days who still wrote real tunes, not the watered down pop s*** or grunting two note noise that passes for metal for too many bands today.  Tobias Ridge is a smooth vocalist, yes, that's Papa Emeritus I, II, and III, who used to sing with the band Repugnant, and his youthful voice is a startling contrast to his stage getup of the skeleton\/greasepaint head and miter.\n  \"Cirice\", the first single, is not blatantly Satanic by itself, and shows what Ghost are capable of beyond the silly image they carved for themselves.  \"Mummy Dust\" is probably the heaviest rocker on the album, along with \"Devil Church\", referring back to \"Opus Eponymous\", and songs like \"Elizabeth\".  The album is a damn good one, as all Ghost albums thus far have been.\n  But fellows, and this is just my opinion from a 54 year old dude who may be out of the league anymore image wise but still know good tunes when I hear them, you have the chops and the intelligence.  You have injected into rock and roll a return to real songwriting, not the bland alternative rock that's lame and devoid of hooks, mall music or just about anything else.  You deserve recognition and I strongly suggest you drop the anonymity and Satanic schtick.  It will wear thin, I guarantee you, and you'll be relegated to a has been status playing casinos in the Plains states someday as a nostalgia act if you don't expand.\n  I would hate to see you become a caricature of yourselves, like Aerosmith, KISS, and other formerly mighty bands of the era you obviously adore.  The Satan angle worked to get attention.  You have it.  Now, get out there as yourselves and possibly enjoy a much longer successful career.  Remember:  a gimmick works only so long.","classification":5,"fold":3}

I think Sinatra might have told him, \"If you even DREAM of singing my songs, you better apologize when you wake up.\"\n\nThis album is akin to an artist taking a crap on a blank canvas and his followers marvel over its 'texture'.  Hey!!!  The emperor has NO CLOTHES!!  Wake up, you fools!!\n\nThis album is as if Richard Simmons did a video called \"The Mike Tyson Workout\".  It is so egotistical of Dylan to, given his LOUSY singing voice, tackle songs done by Frank Sinatra.  But, line up and buy this pathetic album all of you Bobby Zimmerman worshipers.  As Arlo Guthries said many years ago, \"If you want to see Bob Dylan in concert, you've got to come see me.\"\nOh, I did like his older music and saw him with The Band (they opened for him) in 1974.  I liked his acoustic songs and was falling asleep during the electric portion of his set.  IMO, Bob Dylan has become a parody of himself.  Can't wait for his next Victoria Secret's ad.\nIf heaven and hell exist, this could be Bobby Z's ticket to the latter.\n\nOh, the songs, as sung by Dylan, suck.  Nuff said.","classification":1,"fold":3}

{"text":"The only regret you have listening to Otis Redding is how abruptly and tragically his work was abbreviated. As important as his work is,  to not only American soul but all music, he was really  was just getting started when he died in a 1967 plane crash.\n\nThis album, obviouly released after, shows Otis making great soul music and doing what he always had--progressing by leaps and bounds and taking the entire art with him on his mammouth shoulders.  The music here is getting harder, funkier, the riffs more sharply cut, such as on \"No Body's Fault But Mine,\" which Led Zepplin mutated for Presense.\n\nNot only soul--although it is its definition--these are also the gritty ingrediants of funk, which people like George Clinton would brew with Hendrix to make the psychadelic funk of the counterculture.\n\nIf Redding would have partaken in this, you really, really have to wonder, but in and of itself, his work is both everything, and not nearly enough.","classification":5,"fold":3}
{"text":"I really have zero competence to review classical music--being a big band type of guy.\nI purchased the music to use on very low volume as a sleep aid and have found it very useful for this purpose.\nListening to several of the tracks at normal volume the tracks do seem to have excellent clarity.\nJust trying to be honest and somewhat helpful.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I've had METRIC'S PAGANS IN VEGAS since its' release, so this review comes after some time.  I suppose I held off writing a review because I vacillate on how I feel.  I still don't feel it's in the same league as \"Synthetica\" (reviewed separately) & \"Fantasies\", which you know you love on first listen!  Other reviewers have noted PAGANS is more eletro\/synth. than others, so perhaps that has something to do with it.  When I do go electronic, I still enjoy hearing guitar(s) too, especially a strong bass line and strong drums.\n\nPAGAN'S opening track, \"Lie, Lie, Lie\" is a terrific one! which would be quite at home on either of the aforementioned METRIC CD\/LP's.  Track #3 \"The Shade\" has that ethereal, haunting beauty and is quite good, as well as Track #7 \"Too Bad, So Sad\" which almost reaches a \"Youth Without Youth\" tone, while Track #5 \"Cascades\", another favorite, veers into an almost Depeche Mode\/New Order sound.  Track #4 \"Celebrate\" isn't as likable, for me, having an EDM (electronic dance music) quality.  While I enjoy some EDM, I just feel METRIC defies genres, mixing & blending expertly to form their unique sound.\n\nI agree that PAGANS IN VEGAS is definitely more of an electronic release.  Aside from some odd zappy eletro-synth. sounds on some tracks,  PAGANS IN VEGAS, while different from earlier releases, is a strong grower!!!  P.S. Upon some research, I've learned METRIC'S newest release is scheduled for late September!!!  Upon hearing first single \"Dark Saturday\" (fantastic!), if that's representative of the whole I'll be captivated with what may possibly be METRIC'S Finest!!  In the meantime, there's plenty of dazzling METRIC music to keep listeners ears happy!!","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"After buying Eric Clapton's 1988 CROSSROADS box set, I was no longer buying every album the guitarist released. In fact, since that time I've probably purchased no more than a half dozen or so of his albums. That's what makes this 3-CD edition of FOREVER MAN so enjoyable. It provides all the hits since CROSSROADS--there were only four--some side project material, and then cherry-picks songs from the studio albums. The 51 songs are distributed fairly evenly over three categories:  in the studio, live and the blues.\n\nDisc-1 STUDIO (77:37)\n\nHere are the hits:  \"I've Got a Rock N' Roll Heart,\" \"Forever Man\" and the million-seller \"Tears in Heaven.\" (The fourth hit--the live \"Layla\"--is on disc-2.) Other highlights include a couple of J.J. Cale songs: \"Call Me the Breeze\" and \"Anyway the Wind Blows,\" the latter from 2006's THE ROAD TO ESCONDIDO, a collaborative effort with Cale himself.\n\nDisc-2 LIVE (78:57)\n\nClapton's guitar playing shines in a live setting and fans will not be disappointed with the fourteen selections here. Tracks 1-5 are from 1991's 24 NIGHTS and includes a powerful nine-minute performance of the Cream classic \"Sunshine of Your Love.\" Another J.J. Cale song, \"Cocaine,\" is from 1991 and was previously only available as a promotional single. Tracks 7-9 are from 1992's UNPLUGGED, including the acoustic hit version of \"Layla.\" Tracks 10-11 are from 2009's LIVE FROM MADISON SQUARE GARDEN (with Steve Winwood). The final three tracks are from 2002's ONE MORE CAR, ONE MORE RIDER. \"Over the Rainbow\" may seem like an odd choice, but Clapton provides a passionate reading of this chestnut.\n\nDisc-3 THE BLUES (72:25)\n\nThis, of course, is what the Clapton faithful want from the man who is one of the best guitarists of the rock 'n' roll era. There is not a weak cut on this disc and there are no fewer than seven Robert Johnson covers.\n\nIf there is a downside to this anthology, it is the packaging. There are two jewel cases housed in a cardboard digipak. Discs 1 and 2 are in one jewel case, disc 3 is in the other.  The booklets are rather skimpy as well. Discs 1 and 2 have a 8-page booklet with a 3-page essay from rock journalist Malcom Dome, two pages of song info (basically, who wrote and produced the songs and what album it came from--no musician information) and a couple of photos. The blues booklet is even skimpier at four pages. I always enjoy a track-by-track commentary from the artist, but the only comment from Clapton himself is in the essay from a 2008 magazine interview.\n\nHowever, if like me, you've only been keeping up with your Clapton catalog sporadically, this collection does a superb job of covering many of the highlights of the last three decades. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I love Iron Maiden obviously and Steve Harris has been the driving force of that band since its inception, more than anyone else Maiden is Steve's baby. Steve Harris IS Iron Maiden let's get that out of the way. When Harris announced a solo project I thought it was great for him, it was an opportunity to flex his musical muscle outside of the beast that is Iron Maiden and that he could do whatever else he wanted with this one record. In fact I was kind of surprised that he hadn't done this sooner like Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith had, but at the same time Maiden was his reason to live all along. It took long for him to decide to do a solo album and in 2012 we have Steve Harris' first solo album, British Lion. Actually it's more of a side project than a solo record really. The origins of British Lion for further than we'd think. Harris mentored the band of the same name in the early 1990's and nothing happened, stayed in touch with some of the musicians and years later they worked out some music and release this.\n\nAt first I thought the title was a little bland, but I didn't care much it's about the music. Then it hit me that music is very much like the title, bland. It's generic and doesn't really go anywhere, yet doesn't exactly play it safe either and it ends up being quite honestly boring and blank at times. One thing that Maiden brought in the music was power, here there is no power at all it seems to be the exact opposite. It sounds more like a mainstream and commercial rock album than anything else, and I think outside of hardcore Iron Maiden fans supporting Harris there isn't much of a market at all for it.\n\n\"This Is My God\" opens the album and from the start you get a sense that it's going to be different than Steve Harris' usual work and it indicates much of the sound of the album and the direction they were going with. I just find this first song inconclusive, it doesn't do a great job at putting the listener in any mood and it's not effective and a little disappointing to start British Lion with. \"Lost Words\" is much better and paints a nice imagery and feature strong lyrics it picks up the pace a little. \"Karma Killer\" isn't bad and it's almost catchy and I say almost because the vocals just don't go to that next level to bring out the catchiness of the song although it has a nice chorus and feel. \"Us Again The World\" is one of the songs that works, it's one that I could almost picture Bruce singing and Iron Maiden performing, but again the vocals aren't there to take it places, they don't soar, they don't do anything and aren't pleasant, remarkable or passionate.. etc and the list goes on. It's a big problem on the album and it fails to excite the listener. \"The Chosen Ones\" and \"A World Without Heaven\" are to me the best tracks on British Lion and they're side by side incidentally. Those are the songs that got me thinking \"well this is interesting, maybe it's not so bad...\" and after listening back found myself thinking that the rest of the album should have sounded a little more like that. Musically they go farther than the rest of album (except perhaps the closing piece \"The Lesson\" which could fit just below that category) and they're catchy and got me rocking and kept my hopes up for the rest of the album.  \"Judas\" is one of the better songs here it has a two minute slow breakdown piece and shows traces of prog and is overall a good song and one that I found myself listening to more often. \"Eyes of the Young\" is boring generic radio rock and doesn't go anywhere really, it's just a very plain song with no feel musically or otherwise I nominate that one the worst track on BL. \"These Are The Hands\" doesn't do it for me, it lacks in the chorus and as a result never arrives or get started.  \"The Lesson\" is not a ballad, but it's definitely a soft song and it features strings and piano and while I actually find myself enjoying it, it just seems out of place on this album as a closing piece especially (but then again it doesn't really fit between any two songs so where else to put it?).\n\nI'm obviously a fan of Steve Harris for his bass playing and Iron Maiden, but I won't bow down to everything that he releases with or without Maiden. I don't think British Lion is close to be an outstanding album that's all. I think most of the problem is the vocals aren't quite up to par. They're not strong but they're not weak yet they hardly do anything even if they don't sound bad, which I realize may be an odd description but it's exactly what they sound like to me. There's very little energy in the songs too, as I said it sounds very blank at times music is playing but it's just... empty. Is it utterly unlistenable? No. There are even some good tracks like \"The Chosen Ones\" but the album and ultimately this whole project falls flat unfortunately and we're left with an album where not much stands out unfortunately. Again not dissing on anyone, they tried but it just doesn't seem to work. I wonder what Dickinson could have brought to some of those songs because some of the lyrics and themes that they had here had more potential than the final product shows.\n\nTo me British Lion was Harris doing a side project and not a solo album it was great for him that for the first time he did something besides Iron Maiden. It was a way for him to do stuff more akin to that of bands he idolized in the 1970's like Thin Lizzy and although it doesn't sound much like his influences it sounds more like 70's and particularly 80's rock than Heavy Metal (even the songs are considerably shorter than some of what Maiden has being doing with their last four albums. I don't hate British Lion, but I don't love it. The album could have benefited greatly from better production too. To me it's not totally a throwaway and it's not gold either but I'm definitely on the fence about this one and I will remember it as more of a novelty, an experiment, something outside of Maiden for Harris than a good, rock album. The main problem is the vocals aren't strong enough nor do they stand out to bring out the music and make it stand, in fact it's the opposite it brings it down. I'm sorry but I tried it's just not an album that's for me I'm afraid 2 1\/2*.","classification":2,"fold":3}

{"text":"In late 2003, the pop rockers Lifehouse, returned to the music scene with their second album STANLEY CLIMBFALL. Their new product was by far some of the rock band's best work. Vocals were incredibly melodic, the rhythm section wasn't over powering, and the entire album just had amazing musical traits. STANLEY CLIMBFALL opens with a good rock dance tune, and soon becomes a collection of powerful rock ballads. The progressions to the songs are not much more than the standard I-IV-V, but there is a reason why that progression is so popular and it works perfectly with the pieces of this album. The band is built from the drums keeping perfect time and the bass as the melodic foundation so the guitars and vocalist can lay out their amazing performance. Everything played by these instruments are so independent from each other but the counterpoint is crafted so well, that the pieces are just outstanding. Dynmaics are a major key to these songs as they should be for any piece, but Lifehouse performs this musical aspect perfectly. STANLEY CLIMBFALL is a great piece of work and one to add to any music collection.\n\nStand out tracks include:\n\n\"Spin\"\n\n\"Wash\"\n\n\"Sky Is Falling\"\n\n\"Stanley Climbfall\"\n\n\"Take Me Away\"","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Kashmir is an undisputed classic. The band members themselves have acknowledged that this song best expressed their vision.\n\nIt opens with a crash of cymbal with a waltzing 3\/4 string\/guitar progression accompanied by a 4\/4 drum pattern. It's what makes the song so interesting, this confluence of different time streams. Keeps things slightly tipsy. Personally, I cannot hear the opening of Kashmir without also being aware of the ending of Trampled Underfoot, the song that precedes it on the album. It is a fleeting moment, but it's there in my brain.\n\nMy favorite part of the song is the minimalist section that lasts from 2:18-3:14; there is so much breathing room in it, Bonham's drums combined with the bass and the descending string slides. Very seductive.\n\nKashmir has a circular theme that rotates around its axis with precision, sections linking up with each other like clockwork. Nice flanging and phasing here and there, mostly on the drum flurries; e.g., 7:50.\n\nMost fans probably know the scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High when Ratner is instructed by Damone to play side one of Led Zeppelin IV, but he 'messes up' by playing Physical Graffiti instead. We all know that any Zeppelin album would make a good choice. Well, maybe not side two of In Through the Out Door. So much has been written about this song, you can find many online treatises that analyze its brilliance. I prefer to let it all wash over me like an oasis in the desert.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Given the recent Flint, Michigan water crisis in which lead and other contaminants from the Flint River were poisoning public water works, it's either a big coincidence that Detroit emcee and former Slum Villager Elzhi also named his eight-years-in-the-making sophomore LP Lead Poison or he knew what he was doing. Granted, Flint and Detroit are a trek away from each other, but word travels fast these days and so will word of Lead Poison, a classic hip-hop album (released far ahead of schedule yesterday March 25 via Glow365). Elzhi released his debut album, Preface, in 2008, and in 2011, he dropped what I'll call a remixtape, the kind dedication-album Elmatic, built with Nas's Illmatic as a major inspiration and guide for it.\n\nIn a work that is as much science as art, Elzhi has took his time crafting this amazing masterwork. With absolutely no dull moments, it has the man unwinding fine creative rhymes with tons of meaning about down feelings, relationship negatives, ghetto poverty, loneliness, and the struggle to maintain and prosper. The expert, emotive music score comes from a pretty big handful of producers. Nick Speed, Bombay, 14KT, Quelle Chris of Mello Music Group, Karriem Riggins, Soledad Brother, Oh No of Gangrene, Joself and Agor are right there for Elzhi, with the appropriate samples and instrument supplements, whether his mood is sad, motivated, energetic or reflective.\n\nThe first four-song block in Lead Poison is quite depressive, but Elzhi uses his music and writing as therapy, not to mention his flawless delivery practices. He goes into the hard knock life in the formal intro, the correspondingly titled second track \"Introverted.\" His great lyricism and wordplay are on display right away in the uninterrupted streams of smart philosophy of \"Medicine Man\" and continue without break thereafter. El's problems with pot and his sadness from longing and loss are very well showcased on \"Weedipedia\" and \"February\" made all the more affective with beautiful soul samples of horns, guitar and piano in at least two of these tracks.\n\nIn \"Egocentric,\" El spits some ridiculously nice rhymes in crazy good rapping that would be insurmountable in battle. Tragedy hits home in \"Two 16's\" as El describes the despair and severe misfortune of two 16 year olds from the ghetto. \"Hello!!!!!\" celebrates communication, or more specifically the joy, magic and technique of reaching out using the device of hip-hop and song as tools, and \"Friendzone\" expresses righteous vitriol to girls that go for low quality dudes, chicks who choose terrible guys.\n\nOver twinkling vibes, Elzhi raps wisdom in nimble and neat rhymes and speaks on avoiding trouble once again with more stories in \"Cloud.\" The \"Alienated\" mega-piece is El's ode to not fitting in and closing oneself off from the world by force and\/or by choice. It may not feel lonely, and in fact, there is something joyful in the split here, yet again, there is no escaping the overcast darkness looming over the loner Elzhi. What probably started as the depiction of a particularly sad abysmal time in El's life, this brilliantly affective song will be commonly felt by most if not all in years to come. This third block ends with \"She Sucks\" featuring Chris Dave, a conceptual\/metaphorical story with links and relevance to one real-world phenomenon in particular.\n\nThe last section ends positively. Elzhi works hard and spreads thoughts of wanting to be self-made in \"Cosign\" featuring Skonie, and in \"Misright,\" he is looking for a good \"down\" girl, fighting to stay afloat in a sea of constant discouragement in this matter. Thabisile Griffin has her wonderful way with words in \"The Turing Point\" interlude-slash-poem, and in the finale, Elzhi chucks some accurate agreeable braggadocio as well as some powerful last words of weight, meaning and lasting value, as he tapers off via a cappella recitation, \"Keep Dreaming\" y'all.\n\nElzhi has really delivered well with Lead Poison. We get to experience his prodigious pencil work of fury here (\"lead\"), and we're warned of some of the natural pitfalls of life too (\"lead poison\"). We also get just incredible hip-hop raps straight to the gut, no chaser, paired with music productions made in that old style of taking the old and making it new again, fresh. Instead of pimping, hoes, goods, gangsters, guns and green (well, except for maybe a little weed), Elzhi and his team of producers impressively convey real human emotions and feelings. They demonstrates how the ordinary can be made extraordinary with vast mic skills accompanied by equally vast music pieces, brought together in touching concoctions. May he be slept on no more. Elzhi is exquisite to the extreme in Lead Poison.","classification":5,"fold":3}

These for me are the best of the best, the whole album is very strong. This is one of those albums, that you will find yourself starting all over again once it ends. I played it three times back to back the other day!! Little Big Town is one the best country groups out there right now, and this album is \"The Reason Why\"!! (bad pun I know, but it works!)","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"While presenting nothing here that is truly new or visionary, it IS interesting to watch Ke$ha grow, here -- the speak-sing style seems to be exactly where she intends to stay. Still using auto-tune liberally, Ke$ha is now layering her vocal tracks with voice-doubles that are not effected, giving this particular song a much more natural feel. At 120 beat-per-minute and held within C-minor throughout, \"R\" was unquestionably written on keyboard. You can almost see her in your mind's-eye, writing this thing on a cheap old Casio keyboard sitting in Mom's basement. This is a song that could have been written in a half-hour at one of my sisters slumber parties -- Ke$ha is not pretending to be anything other than what she is, and that's very cool.\n\nKe$ha's strongest suit is that her vocals are pure FUN; her vibe is always in good humor -- and she makes no pretense that she is doing anything other than simply that: HAVING FUN. She does, however, do it FEARLESSLY (even if awkwardly); she's pure fun presented with an absolute frankness -- almost daring critics to tear into her. I like that, and I like Ke$ha. Cannibal is a fine between-album effort; strong enough to maintain interest and generate a Top 10 single (or two) while she works on prepping her sophomore album. (\"R\" has managed to ring-up 2 million downloads, by the way... including a pair of weeks with 300,000+ downs each and one incredible week with with 400,000+ downs -- no question that \"R\" (and Cannibal) was exactly correct for the current marketplace between albums.)\n\nI'm actually pretty impressed with Ke$ha.\n\nGiven her vocal limits (does she ever leave the octave...?!!), we might see this girl end-up with a monster of a career.\n\nPersonally, I hope she turns-in a blazing follow-up; a strong next album could enable Ke$ha to see herself with a 50+ million album career, and I'd like to see that.\n\nA solid effort, here.\n\n4 stars.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"There's gonna be some mighty fierce debating going on about this album! The most important thing is to keep an open mind. Indeed, Jewel has traded in her acoustic guitar for a new dance floor sound. Indeed, she looks like an 80's Cyndi Lauper on the cd cover. Yet, the biggest thing Jewel has NOT done is sell out. She may look and sound different, but Jewel has remained true to her heart. She has proven that one doesn't need an acoustic guitar to make meaningful music. At the same time, she proves that rhythmic music can be very meaningful as well. Anyone who has listened to the lyrics of 'Intuition' carefully has already figured this out. Jewel is mocking commercialism and materialism! Or, making political and societal statements (if you will). Is this really so different from what she has done in the past? The 'Intuition' video is the biggest mockery of all! The video displays Jewel: The Actress. The songs 'U & Me = Love' and '2 Become 1' follow, lyrically, in the tradition of Jewel's 1996 mega hit 'You were meant for me.' 'America' is yet another song where Jewel discusses the many aspects of American society and makes poilitcal statements. Gosh, this sounds like the same girl to me! Although, despite keeping her lyrics true to heart, the dance beats heard throughout make this cd Jewel's most fun project to date. Heck, it's dance music! Meaningful lyrics or not, it's still fun to listen to! Be sure to listen to the lyrics of each song carefully. You'll discover that Jewel has not, in any way, created fluffy, mindless pop (which some people are accussing her of doing). It's rare to find dance music with a purpose beyond just making people feel energized and relaxed. This album proves that the very essence of Jewel will never change (even though the music has).","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\"; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson. We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic. Whether we are asleep with this beautiful song 'secreting' itself into our memory or 'relaxing' in our romantic, nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning, enrichment, and themes so present in this joyous, uplifting recording. \"Just send for me, oh baby.\"\n\n\"Remember the day I set you free\nI told you you could always count on me\nFrom that day on, I made a vow,\nI'll be there when you want me,\nSome way, some how.\n\n'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,\nAin't no valley low enough,\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you babe.\n\nMy love is alive\nWay down in my heart\nAlthough we are miles apart\nIf you ever need a helping hand,\nI'll be there on the double\nAs fast as I can.\nDon't you know that there\n\nAin't no mountain high enough,\nAin't no valley low enough,\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you babe.\"","classification":5,"fold":3}

I play it perhaps twice a year.  I've always wondered why the title song, a bit more sentimental than the follow-up, \"You Don't Have to Be a Star\" wasn't a bigger hit.  Apparently it did leave the public hungry for more since \"You Don't Have to Be a Star\" gets regular play on oldies stations.  At a reasonable price, those two songs would make this a good buy and the rest would be gravy.  If money means nothing to you, by all means, lay your money down and enjoy.

{"text":"Gordon Lightfoot (born Gordon Meredith Lightfoot, Jr. on November 17, 1938) \"is a Canadian singer-songwriter who achieved international success in folk, folk-rock, and country music, and has been credited for helping define the folk-pop sound of the 1960s and 1970s. He has been referred to as Canada's greatest songwriter and internationally as a folk-rock legend...Gordon Lightfoot's music career has spanned more than 5 decades, producing more than 200 recordings. He helped define the folk-pop sound of the 1960s and 1970s, with his songs recorded by artists such as Bob Dylan, Gene Clark, Dan Fogelberg, Jimmy Buffett, and Jim Croce.\"\n\nThe five songs we get here truly are among the very best from Gordon Lightfoot; and this is excellent music that stands the test of time. \"Sundown\" is brilliantly done; Gordon does this so well and I really like \"Sundown.\" As another reviewer notes, \"Sundown\" really sticks in your mind after you've listened to it! There's also \"If You Could Read My Mind;\" I could never tire of hearing this ballad. Gordon sings this with true passion, heart and soul; it's a little masterpiece. \"Beautiful\" is very well done; and \"Carefree Highway\" is yet another classic Lightfoot tune. The track set ends with Gordon Lightfoot's \"Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.\" \"Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" just like the other songs here, got a lot of airplay when it was first released and it will never sound stale.\n\nGordon Lightfoot fans can download these songs to enjoy them again and again.

{"text":"Its been 18 years since weve had new music from Faith No More. Finally, Mike Patton and the boys are back (and its the first time the band has kept the same lineup on two consecutive albums since The Real Thing and Angel Dust). From the very first moments of Sol Invictus, we know it was worth the wait.\n\nThe album immediately explodes to life with a jazzy track that has Mike Patton channeling his inner folk hero. We know right away that this is still Faith No More, but its not a band just trying to recapture what they were. Over the course of the 10 tracks on the album, the band creates a confident and compelling record that demonstrates a group of musicians coming together for the purpose of music rather than reunion.\n\nThe two lead singles, Superhero and Motherfu**er are two of the strongest tracks here, both showing that Faith No More is still capable of creating that innovative and driving music that pushes the boundaries of what songwriting can do. FNM was not about to settle on this album, and they prove that on every track.\n\nFrom the Dead is the perfect closer to this album, perhaps a symbolic nod to Faith No Mores comeback after all these years. Other songs, like Separation Anxiety, also allude to their time apart, but not in a way that makes this some cheesy concept album. No, Sol Invictus remains a strong and diverse rock album that expresses everything great about this band.\n\nYes, its been 18 years in the making, but this is no nostalgic trip. This is a triumph in every sense of the word. The band has grown and matured but still manages to deliver a unique sound that plenty can try to imitate but no one can match. This is an album that will thrill old fans and create new fans.\n\nFaith No More is alive and unconquered. Please don't make us wait 18 more years!\n\nSidenote: Im a little bummed that I have to wait until July or August for the vinyl release, but other than that, this is pretty much a perfect return for one of the most innovative bands in rock history.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Originally on the minor label release \"Cold Spring Harbor\", this is to my taste Billy Joel at his very finest, maybe the best love song he wrote. Unfortunately, Billy had to escape from the lousy deal and inept management\/production of the contract with his first label and literally hid out in a piano bar for a couple of years. The two best thing that came from his experience with that first record company were this song, which miraculously is one of his best despite the conditions it was originally recorded under, and \"Piano Man\" which arose directly out of that piano bar. There is another version recorded live in front of a small audience by Columbia Records and released on \"Songs from the Attic\" in 1981. That version reached number 23 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart and number 4 on the Adult Contemporary chart. It is the one on most compilations. The original is on one of several versions of \"Greatest Hits Volumes One and Two\" and the live version is on others. The best way to get the original is to download the version from \"Cold Spring Harbor\" The version I downloaded at this link was the live version. They are enough different to make it worth having both! Both versions are great, with the original version being more tender. The live version benefits from the energy of a small intimate crowd and is the familiar version.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"For a musician who has taken 6 years and 5 years between albums in the past, Trent Reznor sure is active lately, and we can probably thank the rising technical possibilities for working outside of record company strictures. But it's important to remember that Ghosts I-IV is NOT the next proper NiN release, and it should be viewed more accurately as a side project. Here Trent eschews lyrics and vocal melodies (his traditional Achilles heels) for 36 instrumental tracks that mostly provide atmospheres for not-so-easy-listening mood music, while highlighting Trent's sequencing and programming skills. It takes many, many listens for all of the tracks to differentiate themselves in your consciousness, but your patience will mostly be rewarded. Ghosts I-IV occasionally recalls the classic albums, delivering mood manipulation a la The Fragile (tracks #3, 11, 17, 28, 33); and surprisingly for this rather quiet collection, harsh Downward Spiral-like angst (#4, 8, 19, 23, 31). There are also a few experimental surprises that have not been heard from NiN before, such as weird bluegrass guitar (#14 - courtesy of Adrian Belew), pummeling rave (#16), old-school gangsta-hop (#24), bass-driven heavy funk-rock (#26, 27), and even vaguely Asian world music (#30).\n\nBut even with those occasional throwbacks and advances, many of the tracks on this release still have trouble rising above the pack. Primarily, almost all of the songs are just too short for their ideas to develop beyond basic introductions. In fact, just two tracks (#20, 34) feature more than one basic beat pattern or chord progression. And there are just too many weak tracks that turn moodiness into boredom - ranging from thin beat programming exercises (#9, 18), simple piano melodies propped up unsuccessfully with random noise (#10, 13, 22), and basic sequencer patterns that repeat to the point of absurdity (#6, 34). Of course, fans should feel as mellow and moody listening to Ghosts I-IV as Trent probably did while creating it. But at times there are just too many under-developed ideas vying for the listener's and the creator's attention. [~doomsdayer520~]","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Satellite Flight has always kind of been a little bit of a mystery since it was announced. Cudi announced the EP turned album when he was on tour in October and we didn't really hear much about it aside from the single \"Satellite Flight\" in December as well as the album artwork and the tracklisting. The EP was turned into an album at the last minute, and even today it doesn't make sense. The album features Cudi either rapping or singing on six of the tracks while the other four are instrumentals. The album comes and goes pretty quickly, lasting only 41 minutes, but leaves you satisfied and wanting more. Just like Cudi promised.\nLet's get the instrumental tracks out of the way. \"Destination: Mother Moon\" is a pulsing and cinematic track that sets the tone of the album well. \"Copernicus Landing\" starts out a little weird before really picking up towards the end, showing what's to come later in the album. \"In My Dreams 2015\" is something you would expect to hear while waiting in line for Space Mountain at Disneyland, that being said, it's actually a very enjoyable short little track. \"Return Of The Moon Man (Original Score)\" is the most epic sounding song on the album as it sounds like the rough synths were inspired by Kanye West's \"Blood On The Leaves\", It has an incredibly cinematic feel to it, and ties the first 8 tracks together well and sets up the last track beautifully. Cudi did an amazing job making the instrumental tracks just as vital and enjoyable as the others, which is never an easy goal to accomplish.\nCudi did a little more singing in the album than rapping, but that's okay because everything he does here brings back the feelings of some of the stuff he's done in the past. \"Going To The Ceremony\" sounds like it was originally supposed to be a WZRD track, but is one of the more easily likeable songs when it comes to new comers. \"Satellite Flight\" stood as the unofficial single from the album, and though it isn't really a radio hit, it shows that Cudi hasn't forgotten his roots and it's just refreshing to listen to, especially if you're a long time Kid Cudi fan.\"Balmain Jeans\" is the only song with a guest feature, curtosy of Raphael Saadiq, and it's near perfection. Saadiq's feature isn't huge as Kid Cudi dominates the song, but when he does come in, it's absolutely perfect. I'd almost go as far as to say \"Balmain Jeans\" is one of the most well-rounded and solid tracks Cudi has ever produced. (And that piano riff towards the middle of the song was incredible).\n\"Too Bad I Have To Destroy You\" was the one track I was looking forward to the most due to the title, and it stands as the trippiest song that Cudi sings on. The instrumental is similar to that of \"In My Dreams 2015\" but more friendly with Cudi's voice. He manages to stretch the song out for almost seven minutes, but he keeps it interesting throughout the entire song. \"Internal Bleeding\" is the only point in the album where the album kind of takes a misstep, but even then it's a very minor one. The production, like every other song on the album, is flawless. Though Kid Cudi overdoes the hook, some may like it, but it took me some getting used to. \"Troubled Boy\" stands out as the sore thumb when compared to the rest of the songs, but it mixes with the story perfectly. Cudi's singing is perfect for the acoustic guitar-dominated instrumental, and it ends very abruptly which not only sets up Man on The Moon 3 very well, but gives us somewhat of a cliff-hanger ending making us want more.\nSatellite Flight might be as close to perfection as we see this year. It may not make as much noise as major studio albums that will come out this year. But when you listen to this album from beginning to end, this could easily be one of the best, most rewarding album of the year.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 10\/10\n\nMUST HAVE SONGS: (This album is meant to be listened to from beginning to end, and you'll get the best experience doing it that way, but if you have to only get a few then...)\n\n- Balmain Jeans\n- Satellite Flight\n- Too Bad I Have To Destroy You Now\n- Return Of The Moon Man (Original Score)\n\nAuthor's Note: I've been a huge Kid Cudi fan since Man On The Moon: End of Day, in fact that album is my third favorite of all time, and after listening to this album all the way through four times, i've come to the conclusion that this is the type of album that in order to get the full effect, you need to listen from track one to ten without shuffling or skipping any tracks. It's truly an incredible project. It may not be as big or good as the original Man on The Moon, but it's almost if not just as rewarding as it. If you're a Kid Cudi fan, you've got to give this one a shot.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"We certainly have a fascination with disaster films.  From towering infernos to world wide climate change, we just can't seem to get enough.  Some of these films are better than others and they usually make a pretty decent profit in theaters.  Hollywood continues to push them out and many gladly pay to see them.  We've seen the story before so what is the big draw to see them?  It's probably because they are just fun to watch!  Also, disaster films seduce us with the incredible special effects and you have to admit that Hollywood is getting better with this all the time.  Yes, it's the same story with even better realism.  Now, within those really cool effects we've got to have a story somewhere and with that your going need to support it with music.  Hollywood can spend a lot of money on the effects but the only way to make them \"special\" and truly stand out is with a soundtrack to make them even more emotionally incredible.\n\nLooking through my collection of movie scores, I've noticed that the music for these films can be a mixed bag sometimes.  Some reflect the musical tastes of the time in which they were created while others tend to be gigantic filler music pumped with a large brass section of the orchestra.  There are a few that take the interesting approach of having the music take on the characteristic of the impending doom like that of Laurence Rosenthal's \"Meteor\" score.  This particular score, composed by Andrew Lockington, is very similar to what Harald Kloser did for \"The Day After Tomorrow\" and \"2012\".  It's a pretty big sound throughout the score that blends a lot of action noise with an occasional developed theme.  I'm leaning towards Lockington's score here however because when the theme comes, it's a pretty good one.  I also enjoy his scoring of the more emotional moments in the movie and instead of rushing through these scenes with only a steady hum of the violins, he puts up an effort to give some really heartfelt moments.  Tracks 12 (Remembering Mallory) and part of 13 (Coit Tower Destroyed)  are example's of this.  There are some really great action themes in the score as well that I am sure do a good job of reflecting some big moments in the movie.  One of my favorites in this score is the very epic sounding \"Skydive\" (track 14).  It's a short cue but a very cool one.  As a matter of fact, the shortest tracks are some of the best in my opinion.  I guess it's because some of the longer ones tend to get a little exhausting to listen to because of the intensity they sometimes reach.  I am sure this has a different feel when watching in context with the movie however.  They can be enjoyed and appreciated on there own but I find myself developing playlist of the shorter cues.  Some of my favorites are \"San Francisco\" (6), \"Main Title\" (1), \"Skydive\" (14), \"Extinction\" (18), and \"I Love You Dad\" (21).  Another cue deserving a mention is number 22, \"Resuscitation\", it's a great combo of theme, action, and emotion that is put together especially well and very fitting for what is probably a big climatic moment at the end of the movie.\n\nThere are some other interesting facts about this particular score that can be found in the CD's liner notes.  One is that Lockington used seismic wave data from the San Andreas fault and turned it into music.  I just wish there was more of an explanation of this, in the liner notes, and how it was used in specific tracks.  I do appreciate Lockington's desire to create this score in a unique way by using the \"music of an earthquake\".  I just wish this could of been explored more to give this particular music an even more interesting sound.  To me, the score tends to nestle a little too close with the other disaster scores of recent times and doesn't find a way to \"break away\".  By no means does it make it a bad score for the movie, in fact, it's a good score with some awesome moments.  I encourage film music fans to hear for themselves.  One track in particular is really shaking things up and that is Sia's rendition of California Dreamin'.  It's a great song for the film and the interpretation fit's very well.  Oddly, she isn't even mentioned in the credits of the CD insert.\n\nI like to own physical CDs so I was upset to see that this was a digital release and the only way to get a physical copy was to go through the CDR route with Amazon.  I've purchased other CDRs from Amazon before and I've always been impressed with their packaging of these.  They include picture discs, liner notes, and everything you'd expect with the \"look\" of a store bought CD.  They sound great and they've been pretty nice to purchase.  This particular CDR was a little more expensive than their other previous offerings however and I was disappointed to see that they skimped a little with this particular package.  They've included some pictures from the movie and recording sessions and there is a note from the composer which is cool but they only have the track listing on the inside of the CD.  The back cover of the CD has nothing.  The listed credits are incomplete and the total package seems a bit plain to me.  It's still a bit better than what I could of done with my CD burner and printer however.\n\nThe score has a total of 24 tracks and runs about 1 hour and 13 minutes.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"This CD was released in 1984. The sound quality is very good.  Much better than many of the CD's released in the mid eighties.  It is 39 minutes long, which is fairly short by Miles Davis's standards.  His LP's used be 25 minutes to 30 minutes a side.  The double album, Get Up With It was 2 hours long.\n\nThis is eighties style jazz, but with a Miles Davis flair to it that makes it better than most jazz released at the time.  The eighties were not a very good time for jazz.  Sunday Brunch, light jazz was all the rage.  People like Spyro Gyra and later Kenny G were popular.  Also musicians were folding in New Age jazz (which at the time was about the only thing that was interesting).  People like Chick Corea and Bill Cobham went light and pop.\n\nThis CD has that distinctive 1980's jazz sound.  Code MD sounds like something Chick Corea would have done.  There are also twinges of 80's Weather Report.\n\nThe band on this CD includes John Scofield on guitar and someone named Robert Irving III on keyboards.  They wrote most of the compositions.  Also appearing in spots in Branford Marsalis (who now plays with all the jam bands like the Gov't Mule and Widespread Panic).\n\nThis CD is more lively and a little more main stream than Davis's earlier work.  It is certainly more accessible to the general population than anything Davis has done.  But, it isn't bland or white bread like most popular music.  If you want Bitches Brew or Sketches of Spain or Doo Wap, this isn't it.  This isn't ground breaking.  But, it shows that Davis can take on any style and make it better.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Speaking for my own experience I got into Teena Marie late,around 2006. I quickly absorbed as much of her music as I could,through some very interesting and trying periods of my life. Because of her extremely rich musical tapestry and transcendentally rangy vocal abilities,she was one of those artists who gave people they impression she was performing both individually for them and the whole world all at the same time. It's a level of soul you don't get often. Billy Holiday had it. Ella Fitzgerald had it. Chaka and Aretha have it. And Teena Marie most certainly had it. Sadly shortly after Christmas of 2010,that voice suddenly went silent at the age of 54. I never felt she got the acknowledgement she deserved,it was sad and I thought it was all over for Teena Marie. Than later last year it was announced to me her final album was coming out posthumously. Little about the new year to come in music was more exciting news to hear.\n\n  With her fine band of musicians helping out Lady T gets things off to a fine start with the grooving \"Luv Letter\",a juicily slippery and sticky funk number among the classiest she ever threw down. It's back to the more 80's \"Sexual Healing\" type spare electronic\/percussion style on \"Love Starved\",a song that would not have been at all out of place on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Robbery\/dp\/B007FGQ0TW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Robbery<\/a>. The danceable \"Rare Breed\",featuring (and co-written by) her daughter\/musical partner Alia Rose as well as the spicily sexual \"The Long Play\" (name dropping JB's \"Ain't That A Groove\" is always a good thing coming from her) are perfect examples of how to do modern pop\/R&B with strong old school craft and instrumentation. Partly sung in what sounds like Portuguese \"Maria Bonita\",written for her mother is a scintillating synergy of funky salsa and jazzy soul that leaps right out of the speakers.\n\n  Of course ballads such as \"Definition Of Down\",\"Carte Blance\" and the intensely romantic title song excursion go right for her renowned reputation for the \"fire and desire\" she's put into every one of her torch soul ballads since day number one. She also covers Curtis Mayfield's \"Give Me Your Love\", duetting with her high pitched voiced daughter Alia again for a sweetly funky tribute to the master of sweet funk himself. The soulful drama of \"Wild Horses\" (not the Rolling Stone's classic,but just as powerful on a very different groove) is followed by \"The Perfect Feeling\",a hauntingly meditative mixture of East Indian and Arabic melodic ideas,complete with tabla drums and sitar. Duke Ellington had a certain musical signature some referred to as \"Ellingtonia\". Well I am convinced Teena Marie here had a similar quality I'll call Teeningtonia for the lack of a better name. There's just this unique stamp to her vocal,songwriting and musical approach that signifies itself all on it's own. And even though she's not with us to bask in this albums potential creative fruits,that quality drips from this album like garlic butter if you will-rich,creamy and with a tangy undertone. Gorgeous music through and through.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Monolithic Baby! is the sixth full-length Monster Magnet studio album, it sees the New Jersey based stoner band stripping back their sound to the hard rock basics and introduces new members Jim Baglino on bass and Michael Wildwood on drums for the first time.\n\nThe album is absolutely spot-on in terms of quality, the songs are memorable, the production is good and there is an audible enthusiasm to the performance. Monster Magnet, like so many bands, may have a reputation stating that their early stuff is what you want to be listening to and the rest is take-it-or-leave-it, but I assure you that in the case of Monolithic Baby! that is only a stylistic argument, not a qualitative one.\n\nThe aforementioned stripped back sound finds the band concentrating mostly on fundamental and simplistic rock tracks, that eschew whatever elements of psychedelic sounds were found in the bands style from their first few releases as well as no longer exploring many different directions at once, like on the two eclectic albums which preceded this one.\n\nThe fact that there are no surf songs, electronic semi-ballads or drugged out eastern tinged epics could be seen as boring, indicating a lack of variety and an unwillingness to break any new ground. Conversely, it can be viewed as the band concentrating on what they do best, uncomplicated by external factors and delivering only the hard rock, giving only big riffs, gnarly solos and attitude filled vocals.\n\nRegardless of which way you view the change in direction, there are some very great songs on this album, including the (almost) title track `Monolithic' as well as the strong opener `Slut Machine' and the famous and very catchy `Radiation Day.'\n\nMost Monster Magnet fans are fond of Dave's Vocals and lyrics, which are up to their usual high standard on this record, and most fans will be more than happy with this album, the songwriting is of a very high caliber and there are so many rocking songs that this is one of the most direct, focused and in your face records the band have made.\n\nOf course, some Monster Magnet fans don't necessarily dig direct rock songs and therefor could ask for a little more variety from the album, perhaps more crazy effects, longer songs and inclusion of a wider array of instruments. If that describes your feelings in similar situations then maybe give Monolithic Baby! a miss, elsewise do not hesitate to pick up a copy, it really is a very enjoyable record.","classification":5,"fold":3}
{"text":"You get all three symphonies, the choral works, the piano concertos, the three part Symphonic Dances (with the mysterious saxophone) and the tone poems. My favorite, The Bells (to Poe's poem) is sung in English. This is good--as the poem was written in English, but also bad, as the recording in Russian done years ago is, in my opinion, more beautiful. But this is a very exciting work and it's nice to have it along with the concertos and the folk songs. You can't beat the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra & Leonard Slatkin as director. He has a real feel for the Russians, loves the orchestral richness and melody.

{"text":"I own all of Prince's albums, and I listened to them all, in chronological order, leading up to the release of \"Lotusflow3r\".\n\nAny time Prince releases a double or triple or quadruple album I am instantly skeptical. Most artists can not pull off a double album. This holds true for Prince with the exception of \"Sign O The Times\". In general, \"Lotusflow3r\" would have benefitted from being condensed into one album, not two. I think half of \"Lotusflow3r\" and half of \"MPLSound\", combined, would have made a four star album.\n\n\"Elixer\" by Bria Valente, I didn't even bother with.\n\nThis is Prince, after all, and that is who I am critiquing.\n\n\"Lotusflow3r\": A combination of psychedelic funk rock a la Jimi Hendrix, Curtis Mayfield, Sly and the Family Stone and James Brown, with a sprinkle of Herbie Hancock. \"From The Lotus...\" opens the album in a breezy, relaxed jazz mood--this is Prince in his effortless best. This segues into \"Boom\", a psychedelic Jimi Hendrix number that works more often than not. This segues into a more psychedelic cover of Tommy James & The Shondells' \"Crimson & Clover\" replete with an interpolation of The Troggs' \"Wild Thing\"--love it or hate it, I liked it, and I'm a big fan of Joan Jett's definitive version. \"4Ever\" is relatively decent, but nothing exciting. The Curtis Mayfield informed \"Colonized Mind\" echoes Mayfield's \"If There's A Hell Below...We're All Gonna Go\". By far, one of Prince's best songs here. The James Brown influenced \"Feel Good, Feel Better, Feel Wonderful\" is some of Prince's best funk on the entire set. \"Love Like Jazz\" is tepid. \"77 Beverly Park\" is an interesting Italian serenade instrumental--something you would not expect from Prince. \"Wall Of Berlin\" is amusing, but not quite sustainable, while \"$\" is more interesting, but also not quite sustainable. \"Dreamer\" brings back Hendrix in the album's other socio-political statement--one of the better tracks here. \"...Back 2 The Lotus\" uneventfully closes the disc as the third instrumental here.\n\n\"MPLSound\" is supposed to be a return to Prince's 80's heyday. It sounds like he rifled through \"1999\", \"Sign O The Times\" and \"Lovesexy\" leftovers and tried to make something of them. The result is very uneven, and honestly, I would have preferred a futuristic funk extravaganza rather than a trip down memory lane. \"(There'll Never B) Another Like Me\" kicks things off to a funky groove, but ultimately the song is unmemorable. \"Chocolate Box\" is better, but still feels rather stale. \"Dance 4 Me\" rekindles that old Prince funk, and is probably one of the best tracks on the set. \"U're Gonna C Me\" is dreadful balladry. \"Here\" is tropical and a bit better, but still unmemorable. \"Valentina\" is boring, and \"Better With Time\" is equally dull. \"Ol' Skool Company\" is pretty good, one of the better tracks, but it goes on for two minutes too long. \"No More Candy 4 U\" is another funky track that works, and is one of the sets better songs.\n\nAs a long time Prince fan and appreciator \"Lotusflow3r\" fell below expectations.

{"text":"There is so much that could honestly be said about Nicki MInaj, and the lack of really strong songs that could be said into what made her talented. Sadly, the lack of strong songs that led into what made The Pink Print, shows just how washed up she has been, and making so much about her voice, and it is not there. Truffle Butter from Nicki's album The Pink Print, is another one of those songs that lacks her own chops, and instead just puts the rapping into Drake's own hands. Sadly, she doesn't deliver as what she should have. It truthfully, is a song that lacks her talent all the way from start to finish. The song lags absolute heart, and Nicki MInaj herself just drags her own voice. I think it is going to be time for Nicki Minaj to consider retiring from making rap music, because she just isn't even close to being a rappers' delight, and instead the truffle better she has put out, has left a sour taste in the mouth.\n\nSong: F+","classification":1,"fold":3}

{"text":"Alice Cooper's 1982 \"Zipper Catches Skin\" is more straight-ahead rock and less New Wave than his two previous albums, but contains some material that seems like leftovers from \"Flush the Fashion\" and \"Special Forces\".\n\nIt's an average Alice album at best, and if you skip this one you're not missing that much.\n\nThe best cuts are the galloping opener \"Zorro's Ascent\"; The fiery, clever \"Tag, You're It\" has Alice assuming the role of horror-movie director and the entire song is made up of his direction to the terrified leading lady hiding from a psycho-killer. It alone makes this album worth getting. Though the militant \"I Better Be Good\" sounds like a leftover from \"Special Forces\", it's still one of the best tracks here lyrically and musically. Patty Donahue of The Waitresses appears to take Alice to task on \"I Like Girls\" and her asides are typically amusing and make the song (\"What happened? Run out of gas?\" etc).\n\nAmong the rest: \"Make That Money (Scrooge's Song)\" is nothing special except the instrumental finale sounds like something straight out of the \"Killer\" era, which should please fans of the original ACG. In the slower \"I Am the Future\", Alice forgoes the sap of earlier shamaltz for a ballad with bite--exactly like a slow Coop song should be.\n\nSome of the lyrics get a little silly, as on \"No Baloney Homosapiens\" but it's a decent sing-a-long cut nontheless, the showy chorus reminiscent of \"Hello Hurray\". The rocking \"I'm Alive (That Was the Day My Dead Pet Returned)\" also sounds like something from B$B updated for 1982.\n\n\"Adaptable (Anything For You)\", \"Remarkably Insincere\" are actually both UNremarkable.\n\nAlthough \"Zipper Catches Skin\" is not a bad album--and would be decent for any other artist, Alice is capable of much more than what's here.\n\nThree Stars--an average Coop effort.","classification":3,"fold":3}

Her voice is strong, focused and expressive for the most part, and she brings an energy to the music that indicates she is having fun.  But the lowest notes sounded overly throaty like they were just slightly out of her range.  (I'd be willing to bet that she'll be able to nail those notes in three or four years.)

It has been over 20 years since Toni Braxton took on the music industry, and her success as a part of Laface records still has been a cornerstone of what great female R&B music is absolute;y like. Un-Break My Heart, is honestly one of Toni's masterpieces from the sensual Secrets record. The song is definitely one of those songs that blends beauty, voice and soulfulness all into one, which Diane Warren had beautifully wrote for her. The song is absolutely one of a kind, and still sounds much more beautiful every time I heart it. Something that acts like Rihanna, Mariah Carey and Beyonce' Knowles could take a real page on that female songstresses did like Toni back then. If you have never heard a Toni Braxton song before, this is really the one to go to first. I sincerely recommend it.\n\nSong: A+","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"On their 3rd album, this British band presents some seriously haunted heavy metal fairy tales of psychedelic terror.  Its a perfect symbiosis of sleazy hard-rock crunch and trippy, vampire\/stripper-elf explorations in rock n roll transcendence. Kevin Starrs voice is downright creepy, sometimes strangely recalling A Cast Of Thousands-era Adverts.  Theres an overall drone-marching quality to many of the songs, plus an emphasis on repetition that gives them a subtly mesmerizing appeal.  The guitars soar & rock with a muscular purpose, riding eerie lead riffs with a ghostly allure and demonic power.  And, in the midst of all this, are classic rock choruses, retro\/prog references and a surprisingly immersive, melodic magnetism.  (You can even hear allusions to the chord structure of The Beatles I Want You [Shes So Heavy] in the brilliant title track).  Sometimes recalls bands like Pink Floyd, Baroness, Big Elf, Mastodon, White Manna, Ghost, Kadavar, Cathedral, Led Zeppelin.  Uncle Acid have developed a unique sound that will call to anyone who gets the ROCK, knows which end of the bong to suck on, and is open to the transformative power of musical mutation.  Unequivocally, one of the years best albums.  Highly Recommended.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Much like their excellent breakthrough album No Name Face, Stanley Climbfall after many rotations has revealed itself to be another stunning effort. In Jason Wade, Lifehouse appear to have a genuinely first-rate frontman and a fine writer of melodic, literate rock songs and who at a young age seems to have mastered all the combinations of chord changes that have direct access to the heart. The sounds Lifehouse's music immerses itself with have been used so frequently in the name of such mediocrity in the post-grunge era - that perhaps the hardest thing about listening to an album like Stanley CLimbfall is finding the conviction to believe in it's greatness. Lifehouse are truly a cut above. This is an album that by turns embraces terrific monster-hooks (Wash, Am I Ever Going To Find Out, and the title track) and subtle yet glorious melodies which reward repeated listenings (The Beginning, and the wonderful bonus track How Long) which, incredibly, is actually a real bonus - not just a cast-off. This is one band that deserves all the success they can muster and I highly recommend that we contribute to bands that consistently offer quality, depth and a reaon to keep coming back for more.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Katy Perry finally came into her own as a singer\/songwriter with \"Prism\". \"One of the Boys\" and \"Teenage Dream\" were decent pop records, but I always thought they were too poppy and commercial. On \"Prism\", there's still a handful of glossy pop gems, but there's darker undertones which shows Katy in a different and exciting light. It's funny that the first single, \"Roar\" is the only song that doesn't work. It's a safe and predictable song. Doesn't show much growth. But the album REALLY comes alive with the next track, \"Legendary Lovers\". Wow. One of my favorites here. Love the sitar and catchy chorus. This song will get stuck in your head for sure. \"Birthday\" is fun but not silly. I really enjoy it. It has some flavor to it. \"Walking on Air\" is an ode to '90s House music. I really like this song, probably because I liked this genre of music growing up. Has a great rhythm and flow. \"Unconditionally\" is the first of the ballads. It really shows how strong Katy's voice has gotten over the years. She belts her little heart out. Beautiful and sentimental. \"Dark Horse\" reminds me of \"E.T\" from \"Teenage Dream\". \"Dark Horse\" has a good beat but the rap by Juicy J is pretty bad. Next! \"This is How We Do\" is awesome. I love Katy's wicked sense of humor. \"International Smile\" is a tad corny but it's cute. It's sunny, bright, and very girly. \"Ghost\" is when the darker elements of \"Prism\" start to surface. It's pretty obvious \"Ghost\" is about her failed marriage to Russell Brand. Katy doesn't mince words on this track. She lets herself be vulnerable and raw. This song is special. I love it. \"Love Me\" and \"This Moment\" are very important tracks about self-acceptance and finding balance. Katy's vocals on these 2 songs reminds me of Kelly Clarkson. Again, excellent dark songs. Katy really digs deep here. \"Double Rainbow\" is a superb album cut. Took until the second listen until I realized how poetic this song really is. And finally the song that gets me teary-eyed and gives me chills, \"By the Grace of God\". Her most personal song to date. Her vocals are once again flawless and powerful. The lyrics are just...WOW. She doesn't hold back. This is my first Katy Perry album that I've given 5 stars. This album was not as successful as her last 2 but that doesn't mean it's not good or memorable. With the exception of \"Roar\", \"Prism\" is a top-notch, well-written and well-produced record. Kudos to Katy for taking artistic risk. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Count me among the many who were sufficiently dismayed at My Morning Jackets strangely simultaneous evolution from dreamweavers to self-imitators around the exact time Evil Urges arrived on the grating screech of overreach. I kind of had a falling out with the band then, made a little bit of an effort to get into Circuital, but I had resigned myself to never hearing much of the soaring, celestial mystery you hear in classics past. Its cool for a band to evolve, sometimes you just evolve in a different direction than they do. No biggie.\n\nThe Waterfall is more of a continuation of my glancing interest in what they're up to, combined with a fatalistic pessimism that weve seen the very best they can do so far.  There are some tracks here, however, that are not only among their very best, but take the bus in a strange new direction that was unforeseen, intriguing, and rather dark in a good way. The first order of business is to get past the first two tracks, which are embarrassingly bad and borderline rival even the most cheeseball moments of Evil Urges.  Believe has absolutely nothing to say and nowhere to go, and Compound Fracture wallows in genericness, a real stinker.  But from there on out, prepare to get your wig blown back by a band on a mission, with the next two tracks being back to back classics, incorporating a wide-eyed, almost childlike wonderment, flirting with the listener, an exhausting journey that reaffirms they are capable of still producing some astounding music. Putting the hypnotic qualities of repetition to use on Like the Rivers middle section and The Waterfalls insistent vocal hook, you honestly don't want those two songs to end. Spring finally does something mysterious and uncharacteristic with Jim James obsession with dance rock, and Thin Line and Tropics throttle way up on a soulful groove that feels startling, uncomfortable, real.\n\nMy high expectations for a real fine closer were dashed, and the album lands where it started at jammy mediocrity. I suppose the one thing we can always expect from My Morning Jacket from now on is inconsistency... Ill take it.","classification":3,"fold":3}

So apparently being a fan of the Electronica gurus Daft Punk, he went to them and the rest is history.\n\nI am not a big collector of soundtracks, but the select few I do have just have that certain something. The Tron Legacy soundtrack however has so much more! The score on this soundtrack is a phenomenal blend of electornica with a classical score and the pieces fit perfectly. The sound is fluid and hard hitting and soothing all at the same time. This kind of a collaboration has never been attempted and Daft Punk pulled it off and they should be damn proud.\n\nIf you are not a fan of these kinds of sounds I promise you once you see how well it works with the movie as a whole you will run to the store and pick this up. The soundtrack actually moves the movie itself along and makes so much better. The Tron Legacy soundtrack is definitely going to set the bar for the way soundtracks are composed in the future and I would have been great to see this soundtrack get nominated for Best Origonal Score, but since the Academy is a bunch of clueless A**bags, another great piece of music gets over looked.","classification":5,"fold":3}

The song \"Profits of Doom\" is basically about the end of the world and wether you believe or not. As a previous comment by someone i will not shame, They did not see the relevence of the lyrics at the beginning of the song and what they had to do with the faster half.

I personally think that the lead singer actually had the best intentions in mind when recording this very compelling song.  It appears to be about sex, but when you listen to it there can be several meanings depending on how one was raised. I personally think that he was only trying to send an informative message on how the desire for power shapes a persons behavior.

{"text":"\"The piano isn't firewood yet,\" declares Regina Spektor on the melancholy \"Firewood,\" and like so many singers of her ilk, she finds many ways to make you beg her to stay at the keyboards. \"What We Saw From The Cheap Seats\" is an album filled full with optimistic despair, desires quenchless, and Spektor's own unique take on the world of pop tunes. There's a finesse to her songwriting that is now taking on the likes of Randy Newman for elegance in the darkness of the human condition, from the aforementioned \"Firewood\" to the poignant ballad \"How.\"\n\nI think it should be noted that her producer this time is Mike Elizondo, the man who helped Fiona Apple rescue \"Extraordinary Machine.\" Unlike the multi-producer helmed \"Far,\" \"Cheap Seats\" maintains a consistent feel and sound. Be it the guttural rasps that she uses to punctuate \"Open\" or the longing she drives out from \"All The Rowboats\" (...keep trying to row away\"), she's pulling no emotional punches. Yet, even with the album's cohesiveness and dour lining, there are moments of childlike glee. She pulls the chorus of \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\" into \"Oh Marcello\" with such cheer that you'd think she was the original writer, or the warm calypso feel of \"Don't Leave Me,\" which bounces along chipperly.\n\nDon't kid yourself however. Spektor buries the cruelest cuts in her poppiest moments, like \"The Party.\"  \"You're like a big parade through town, you leave a mess but you're so much fun.\" \"What We Saw From The Cheap Seats\" is on a par with \"Far\" and her acknowledge masterpiece \"Begin to Hope,\" and is the type of CD that rewards you the more you listen it it. Her track record continues unbroken.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Johnny Cash is forever with us, in spirit and in his music. The sixth volume of the Americana is a reminder of his greatness.\n\nDuring the last few years of Johnny Cash's life he spent much of his time recording songs that meant a great deal to him. We know from his daughter, Rosanne Cash's recent CD, that her father loved the old time folk\/gospel songs. This CD brings us the uplifting, redeeming qualities that may have been in Johnny Cash's mind as he sang the songs he loved. This is a gruff old voice, but the meaning of his life surrounds us.\n\nRick Rubin produced this CD, as he has all of the Americana series. There are ten songs on this CD that bring the face of death before us.  And, at the same time, we are privy to a forgiving spirit that has seen it all.\n\n'Ain't No Grave' is so perfect, as it opens up the view of the spirit that grows as the CD proceeds. Nothing is going\nto keep him down.\n\n'Redemption Day' is a Sheryl Crow song that had an anti-war stance, but with Johnny Cash it is a song sorrow and love for all- merciful.\n\n'For The Good Times' an old Kris Kristofferson tune, is my favorite- an old hand, giving a tip of the hat to the times of yore when things were good.  A sentimental favorite that we all can relate to.\n\n'Corinthians'- 'death where is thy sting'- looking forward to seeing those gone before.\n\n'Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound' a Tom Paxton tune, wandering and wondering what he was meant to be. A look back and forward to whatever is coming.\n\n'Satisfied Mind'-everything that has gone before is done and done-some regrets but not many- 'believe there is no doubt;- he leaves this old world with a satisfied mind'.\n\n'I Don't Hurt Anymore'- an old folk\/western song- all hurts are forgotten and forgiven. Loves lost and new ones found.\n\n'Cool Water'- was this not an old Frankie Lane song- we can feel the parched throat and the release with that cool water.\n'Dan can't you see that green tree with water running free for you and me'. Love this tune.\n\n'Last Night I Had The Strangest Dream'-there was no war, no strife, no poor, no more war ever. The people were dancing round and round, guns and swords were scattered all around'.  All life's woes are solved and it is time to rejoice.\n.\n'Aloha Oe-Aloha Oe Queen Lili'uokalani's Hawaiian goodbye: 'Until we meet again'\n\nJohnny Cash has given us his peace of mind that carries on. He wishes for peace and love while he faced his mortality.\nOver the years, Johnny Cash always sang the tunes that were right for him at that moment, in his death, he continues.\n\nAloha Oe, Johnny Cash\n\nHighly Recommended  prisrob 02-23-10\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Essential-Johnny-Cash\/dp\/B00005Y1M2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Essential Johnny Cash<\/a>\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/American-IV-The-Man-Comes-Around\/dp\/B00006L7XQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">American IV: The Man Comes Around<\/a>","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I jumped on this for like $26-a steal for this Japanese issue which usually goes for around $70. The mastering is Steller, probably utilizing the DSD masters for the Abkco era and the later tracks don't sound brickwalled, which was the problem with the 2010 Universal re issues-they sounded like crushed eggs. And even though on some of the later tracks you get the 'edited' for radio versions, it's actually nice for the collector to get those versions in great sound, as their not available anywhere else. So I am very happy with this 3cd version of GRRRRRRR!\nGerard Masters","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"What do you say about an album you've had to replace twice on vinyl before finally scoring a hit on a CD that is still with you? That this is likely the single best debut album of the late sixties-seventies singer\/songwriter genre with the possible exception of James Taylor? That the song cycle, singing, and instrumentation here is what still distinguishes Browne as a singular singer\/songwriter\/artist from all the others? That you still smile every time you hear the last few lines of \"Looking Into You\"? This album introduces Jackson Browne and his world of self-examination, endless speculation, and dreamy ruminations about the world at large according to Jackson as he sees it. And of course, he sees it with remarkable aplomb, set to beautiful lyrics and intricate melodies, through a palpable prism of the experience of both love and pain.\n This best-selling album will sail on forever. From \"Jamaica Say You Will\" to Child In These Hills\", from the haunting \"Song For Adam\" to the bouncy rocker \"Doctor My Eyes\", this is a terrific set of songs presented in a lovely and memorable way, as only Browne could. From \"something Fine\" to all the rest of the wonderfully intimate, strikingly autobiographical, personal, and evocative songs he introduced to the waiting world with this album, this is one everyone should have in their CD collection. It is, as Browne himself might say,  a cleverly innocent Technicolor snapshot picture taken on clear, cool Southern California night, after a day in the truth and light of the desert. It is a faithful, memorable, and absolutely artistic reproduction of a moment in contemporary culture made by someone who has built a whole musical career by being the ultimate self-acknowledged dreamer and world-watcher. Spin it and enjoy. I still do.","classification":5,"fold":3}
{"text":"There's no doubt in my mind that David Archuleta has lots of professional talent and this album stuns me with its high quality control holiday music; David never misses a beat and that's wonderful. David really poured his heart and soul into this holiday album and it's very clear when I listen to this; his ability to sing and express the complete range of human emotions is outstanding. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and I like the artwork as well.\n\nThe album starts with \"Joy to the World;\" David sings this with panache and the arrangement plays with the tempo and the keys to let David put his own stamp on this classic ballad! He also really opens up and sings those lyrics with a voice that sounds like that of a much more seasoned entertainer; his talent is quite natural and he also has the ability to go much, much further in his chosen profession which is truly exciting. \"Angels We Have Heard on High\" has a lush musical arrangement and David makes this shine with his fantastic singing. \"O Come All Ye Faithful\" has always been a favorite holiday tune of mine; David Archuleta performs this with panache and he never lets go of a single superfluous note! I love it.\n\n\"Silent Night\" gets a most sensitive treatment from David who delivers this to perfection--and beyond! \"Silent Night\" is definitely a highlight of this album; and listen for David to do a superb job on \"The First Noel.\" \"The First Noel\" charms me with its natural beauty and David's voice sounds like a finely tuned instrument as he sings this faultlessly.\n\nCharice Pempengco joins David for \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas;\" this was first performed by Judy Garland in \"Meet Me in Saint Louis.\" David and Charice make this ballad an outstanding highlight of the album. The somewhat jazzy arrangement fits perfectly with their vocals and I really like their rendition of \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\" It's heaven.\n\n\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" was my mother's favorite holiday song; and David does this justice! He sings this passionately and you can tell he really means it from his heart when you hear him on this track. \"Pat-A-Pan\" is thrown in for a good effect; David performs this very well and it's a good number. \"What Child Is This\" is another charmer that David aces as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing--but of course we know that it really wasn't all that easy. David's talent carries him through.\n\n\"Ave Maria\" sounds just perfect; and the album ends so well with David Archuleta performing \"Melodies of Christmas.\" \"Melodies of Christmas\" is a strong ending number for the album and it certainly leaves me wanting more!\n\nDavid Archuleta delivers on this holiday album and I'm fantastically impressed. This is a must-have for David's fans and it makes a great CD to add to any holiday music collection.","classification":5,"fold":3}

Her personal life had shattered with her marriage to Russell Brand ending in divorce and strife, and she has a lot to regain in herself. Roar, the latest from Katy, and the lead single from her upcoming album Prism has a lot of her fans turning heads at her, for a sound too similar to the strong Sara Bareilles song Brave. Katy turns her version of the sampled song, and makes it weak from the ears and heart. While it might be a treat for die hard Katy Perry fans, it definitely isn't one of her better songs. I would definitely pass this one up.\n\nSong: D-","classification":2,"fold":3}

This Winchester, Virginia, native thrilled the music world like no other and continues to do so, long after her untimely death in a plane crash with country singers Hawkshaw Hawkins and Cowboy Copas.  Patsy could make her voice break and thus break our hearts with her soulful rendering of songs written (and often recorded) by some of country music's greatest.  Consider \"Sweet Dreams\" (Don Gibson), \"Crazy\" (Willie Nelson), \"I Fall to Pieces\", \"She's Got You\", \"Why Can't He Be You?\" (Hank Cochran), \"Back in Baby's Arms\" (Bob Montgomery whose life has been rich in \"country\", including a pre-Crickets duo with Buddy Holly), \"Faded Love\" (co-written by Bob Wills of Texas Playboys fame), \"Leavin' On Your Mind\" (co-written by country\/honky tonk great Webb Pierce) and \"Always\" by one of the all-time great composers of American standards, Irving Berlin.

The rendition of Stevie Wonder's Songs In The Key Of Life staple As, featured in The Best Man Holiday soundtrack doesn't actually deliver. What Anthony Hamilton and Marsha Ambrousius of Floetry fame, doesn't actually deliver in the cover. It tries and be seductive as a slow jam, but it doesn't actually work in any way at all. In fact, the song feels more weak, and others who've covered the song did more justice to it. Like George Michael and Mary J. Blige who did the song over 15 years ago still delivers higher in sound and strength. It is definitely one of the worst Stevie Wonder covers' out there.

{"text":"You'll need a cold one while listening to this.  Wow!!!  1000% improvement over the old silver CD's.  I immediately put on \"The River\", my favorite album, and cued up \"Ties That Bind\", then \"Jackson Cage\", then \"Two Hearts\", then \"Cadillac Ranch\".  Holy crap!!!  Right off the bat I notice the drums are so clear and crisp it's insane.  Max Weinberg is a badass drummer and his playing on the later albums shines here.\n\nSome other improvements I noticed:\n\n\"Born To Run\" and \"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\" have been given a fresh remaster for 2014.  Not recycled from the previous boxsets.\n\nThe production on the \"Born In The U.S.A.\" album sounds cleaner then anything I've ever heard before.  The gated drums echo like thunder.\n\n\"Thunder Road\" always sounded fluttery, like it had a tape wrinkle on the first few piano\/harmonica notes.  No more.  It sounds perfect here.\n\nThe synth\/bass on \"E Street Shuffle\" is so damn funky.  Audio gold.  By the time the song got to the percussion\/horns outro, I had the volume cranked so loud the neighbors could hear it.\n\nThe entire \"Nebraska\" album sounds miles better than the old version.  You can still hear some cassette hiss but nowhere near enough to be distracting.\n\nOn \"The Promised Land\", the harmonica is not overpowering.  The piano, organ and bass and be heard independently in the mix.  Nice and crispy.  The bass is clear and upfront.\n\nThe piano on \"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\".  I always ignored it over the horns but it sounds amazing.\n\nThe chimes on \"Hungry Heart\".\n\nThe echo of the handclaps on \"Working On The Highway\".\n\n\"I'm Goin' Down\" has tambourine throughout the whole song, not just the intro.\n\nIf \"Growin' Up\" or \"Fade Away\" didn't already make you cry, they will now.\n\nPretty much any song with a prominent horn section or sax solo has been vastly improved.  \"Rosalita\" is a great example.\n\nIt's like these were recorded yesterday.  The older albums sound so crystal clear you'll be in tears.  The \"Plangent Process playback system\" should be used by all record labels who reissue music for all future remasters.  The sonic upgrade warrants the extra price.  Don't second guess yourself.  It is worth it.

{"text":"Ever since Imagine Dragons released their CONTINUED SILENCE EP, listeners have been hungry for more tracks from the band.  Their first full-length album, NIGHT VISIONS, meets the lofty expectations the band set for themselves with their debut release.  Imagine Dragons have an indie sensibility that is compounded with a arena-rocking sound that makes them accessible, but not cheap.\n\nThe album begins with \"Radioactive,\" a song that should sound familiar to listeners who have been following the band for a while now.  The mix here is slightly different than past releases, so listeners that bought CONTINUED SILENCE won't be slighted by its appearance here.  The album's lead single \"It's Time\" is full of energy - complete with handclaps and mandolin riffs, the song is accessible and infectious.  It also appeared on their EP, but it sounds just as fresh on this full-length album.  Following it is \"Demons,\" another song that appeared on the band's EP; it's a heart-on-the-sleeve slow-rocker, but it's completely satisfying.  \"On Top of the World\" straddles a line between joyous\/beat and stadium-rocking.\n\nThe vocals of \"Amsterdam\" give it a slightly soulful edge - it feels like new territory for the band, and it's a welcome detour.  The song starts pretty soft but gradually gets louder and louder.  \"Bleeding Out\" serves as an album highlight, and it's just as raw or rough as anything the band has released before.  Imagine Dragons delves into their pop sensibilities with \"Underdog,\" a song that is tinged with electronics and synthesizers.  For me, this song stood out compared to the rest - it didn't work for me, but others might dig it.  \"Nothing Left to Say\" and \"Rocks\" are two songs sharing the same track (about 9 minutes long overall).  \"Nothing Left to Say\" is a slower-burning song that isn't as percussive as the rest of the album - it's a great song made greater by the haunted atmosphere the band provides.  The song's final notes lead into the more uplifting and uptempo \"Rocks.\"  \"Rocks\" finds the band experimenting with mandolin again - it's a great, fun ending to a consistently satisfying album.\n\nMany of the better tracks here were previously released on CONTINUED SILENCE - I can't fault the band for that though.  NIGHT VISIONS is a satisfying release that should catapult Imagine Dragons into the arena-rock stratosphere.  Fans of AWOLNATION or Alex Clare will love this album.

{"text":"This was, in my opinion, the greatest hit of the \"Lovin' Spoonful.\"  Summer In The City has an over the top catchy tune with cascading notes that build in volume with each round. It has a bit of bite and raw edge to it not found in other Lovin' Spoonful songs. There is no other song like it in their repertoire. It does sound date and is stereotypically 1960s in its sound but it is a fine piece of pop writing and worthy of your collection.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"There were quite a few raised eyebrows when Tegan and Sara released this album at the beginning of this year, as it marks a clear\/radical departure from the twin sisters' earliest albums (they had hinted already on more recent albums such as \"The Con\" and in particular on \"Sainthood\" that they wanted to evolve their sound). Hard to believe but Tegan and Sara have been at it for 15 years already, and this is their 8th studio album.\n\n\"Heartthrob\" (10 tracks; 36 min.) opens with \"Closer\" and it immediately hits you that the sound is much more polished, awash with warm synthesizers. Wait, is this the same Tegan and Sara? Why, yes it is! Just in different clothes (musically speaking). As the tracks roll along, such as \"I Was a Fool\" and \"Drive Me Wild\", this is by far the most commercially assessable the Canadian twins have ever sounded. If you can get over this, the album sounds good, even great. If you are pining for the sound from 10 years ago, you will not like tis album, it's that simple. The closing track \"Shock To Your System\" sums it all up, lush sound, rich production, smooth all the way. Couldn't help but notice on that on the booklet containing the lyrics to the songs, the girls inserted their name ahead of two of the songs, so that it now reads Sara: \"I'm Not Your Hero\", and later it reads Tegan: \"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\". Noted!\n\nI have seen the girls in concert a number of times over the years, and just this weekend saw them here in Cincinnati at the Bunbury music festival, where they played to a widely enthusiastic crowd. They played a bunch from the new album (including Closer, Goodbye Goodbye, Now I'm All Messed Up, and I Was a Fool, just to name those), along with a number of older\/classic tunes such as Living Room, and best of all Back In Your Head. Great show all around, and most interestingly, the new songs from \"Heartthrob\" sounded much better live than on the album.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Fans who have long preferred Dylan's rebellious, folksy lyrics won't be disappointed. In a market which often pushes Christianity to the gospel music genre, Dylan steps up and gives us his best music in years.\n\"I  Believe in You,\" is the story of a person who is rejected because of  his faith but doesn't flinch. Dylan hits on a theme universal to anyone who  has believed in something intangible. Autobiographical, he sings about the  public's reaction... they wanted him to sing terribly politically incorrect  lyrics like \"just like a woman...\" when he wanted to sing about  his new found faith in Christ, equally politically incorrect.\n\"Gotta  Serve Somebody\" is witty and insightful, and has a great urban  old-school gospel flavor to it.\n\"Man Gave Names to All the  Animals\" is a funny look at what Adam's first job was in Eden.\nI  fully recommend it.\nAnthony Trendl","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"This was a hard one to write. As as huge fan of the Silversun Pickups, I've seen them in concert twice and have loved much of their body of work. They're a band that manages to create music that's both beautiful and heavy at the same time, with each of their albums featuring no shortage of standout moments and true emotion.\n\nBetter Nature, though, sees the Pickups choosing to hide their musical talents behind a wall of synth, releasing an album that's more electronic than instrumental, and one that as a result lacks much of what makes this band so great.\n\nFrom the start, something doesn't feel right. The opening track Cradle sounds like it was intended to be a heavy one, from the vocals to the structure, but when you get to what should be a heavy chorus, the music simply continues at the same tempo and speed, leading to a track that on a first listen came across as almost forgettable. And as I listened to Better Nature for the first time, I felt my mind wandering and wondered why nothing in these songs was standing out to me.\n\nEventually I realized that the problem was the lack of guitar...or really, any instrument, throughout; Better Nature sees electronics and synthesizing used to imitate the sounds of instruments. You can hear electronic noise and effects that are meant to be the guitar, the drums, and the bass, but isn't. Much of Better Nature sounds like the soundtrack to a video game, and not a bad one, necessarily, but as a Silversun Pickups effort, it comes across as a watered down one.\n\nIt's tough for me to get into synth. I know that in the 80s it was big, (Latchkey Kids sounds almost like a throwback to that era) but my problem with seeing rock groups attempting to do this today (Linkin Park tried a similar style with Living Things, and Broken Bells with After the Disco) is that electronics, no matter how cool they can sound in their own genre, just can't achieve the dynamic feel to me of real instruments. I can hear, when listening to Better Nature, moments that were meant to soar, moments that were meant to be beautiful and emotional, moments that were meant to be heavy, but heard through this electronic filter, they feel muted, at times hardly registering. It makes for an album that can be catchy, but one that's ultimately forgettable, as there's just not much musically to grab onto, and I wouldn't say that anything on Better Nature even comes close to matching the best work on their previous records.\n\nThat's not to say that there's nothing here that's good. The two best songs on the CD (Nightlight and Circadian Rhythm) are strong tracks, though sadly, being the two singles, I'd already heard them before the album came out. These two songs had to have either been the first thing or the last thing recorded in these sessions, because they sound so different from the rest of the album that it's almost hard to believe. And even they don't get by unscathed, as the album version of Nightlight loses entirely the very cool and ominous buildup featured in the music video version of the song, something that makes this version decidedly inferior.\n\nElsewhere, Tapedeck stands out, and it, along with Latchkey Kids and Cradle, would I'm sure sound incredible with real instrumentation. Still, even as presented here, these are good songs, and generally the rest of the album's listenable and catchy, to varying degrees, but it doesn't sound like Silversun Pickups. Vocally it does (Both Brian Aubert and Nikki Monninger give incredible vocal performances throughout) but musically it sounds like someone doing electronic covers of Pickups songs, something that no matter how hard I try, I just can't get past.\n\nBetter Nature was a bummer for me. It's the album that I feared Neck of the Woods would be when I learned that Jacknife Lee would be producing it. Neck of the Woods, though, while it featured an increased use of electronics, was still definitely a Pickups album. Better Nature, though, just comes across as a synth album with Brian singing. Going by interviews the band has given, they seem very happy with the final product, and while I'm happy for them, I really hope that it's not a direction they continue on in the future. They're such a great band, and they're a band whose music needs to be fully heard, not run through an electronic filter.","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"I was, like many, very curious of The Killers' Brandon Flowers solo effort. We've heard the music he's made and written for the group but `Flamingo' is his opportunity to define himself as a solo artist apart from the group. If you're wondering if his style and musical preference is really any different from that of the group, don't worry. It's both the albums' strength and weakness: most of the music on `Flamingo' sounds very much like the music you'd expect from The Killers. If you listen to this album without the knowledge that this is meant to be a solo record for Flowers, you'd think this was just another The Killers release. In a way, I was pleased with the album overall because The Killers and Flowers are known for some very unique music that harkens back to Springsteen, Lou Reed and Bob Dylan. On the other hand, I was let down because I saw this as Flowers' opportunity to be challenged as a writer and musical artist and experiment. Still, `Flamingo' has its high points and makes for a decent solo debut.\n\nThe Good: The best part of the album is the second half. The last half of the features tracks where Flowers ventures away from the style and sound that's come to define The Killers and experiments a bit with different instrumentation and beats. \"Magdalena\" is the first track that really caught my attention from the album. Flowers said that the track itself was inspired by a pilgrimage a group of faithful make to a town in Mexico. Even though the subject feels random, he sounds more connected to this song than the others. Other stand out tracks were \"Crossfire\" with its western flair with a rock vibe; \"On the Floor\" that sounds like a song from the `50s and `60s that features Flowers' great ability to pen lyrics that capture a moment and fully describes it with great details while evoking emotion through his unique vocal style; \"Swallow It\", while sounding suggestive, has Flowers being a bit sensual as he advises a woman who's in over her head take her time and stick to her guns rather than giving up.\n\nThe Bad: The first half of the album was a bit dull in my opinion. It sounds too much like unreleased tracks from The Killers and didn't do much to define Flowers as a solo artist. I was also taken back by how Brandon Flowers chose to release a solo album of music that feels very safe and expected. Yes, he's a songwriter and the image and brains behind The Killers but I felt this solo album was his chance to stand out a bit and do some songs that The Killers would never do as a group. I was shocked that most of the experimentation and chances were taken on tracks left as \"bonus\" extras for the deluxe edition. In my opinion, the tracks like \"The Clock Was Tickin' \" and \"Jacksonville\" should have been included on the standard edition rather than tracks like \"Playing with Fire\" or \"Hard Enough\" which felt like leftover tracks from The Killers.\n\n At the end of the day, I'm on the fence about the album. Of the standard edition tracks, half of them feel inspired and interesting while others feel like leftovers from The Killers' albums. I wish Flowers had taken more chances with his music; the album feels very safe. He doesn't stray far from the type of music or style that's made The Killers a hit band. That's ok, I'm sure many fans will be delighted that `Flamingo' offers up a slew of Killers-worthy tracks. However, with this being a solo album, it seemed like a great opportunity for him to define himself as a solo artist. Perhaps he could have taken more chances with the lyrics; I personally think he could have experimented a bit more with the music and instrumentation backing. I was let down by the fact that producer Stuart Price, the guy behind Madonna's `Confessions on a Dancefloor', Kylie Minogue's `Aphrodite' and most recently the Scissor Sisters' `Night Work' album wasn't able to really take Flowers into any new musical directions. He did wonders for these other artists but his usual synth and mixing style seems absent or subdued on `Flamingo'. If you get the album, definitely spring for the deluxe edition: the bonus tracks add more to the album in terms of variety, style and experimentation.\n\nListen to These: \"On the Floor\", \"Jacksonville\", \"The Clock Was Tickin'\", \"Welcome to Las Vegas\"","classification":3,"fold":3}

As an alternative rock album, it's absolutely terrible and disappointing.  As an R&B album, it's decent.  She has a bit of a raspy voice, some nice and interesting beats.  I liked a couple of the songs, like \"What you Don't Do\".  It's a very sweet and soulful song, with quite a bit of soul behind it.  Some of the rest of the songs were a bit more generic, and some seemed like they were written about nothing in no time on the back of a napkin, like they were added to complete a formula for what these types of albums \"should be\" these days.  The production quality is pretty poor...almost sounds like listening to a plastic record at times.  I imagine this was intentional, like using \"sepia\" in PhotoShop to make any old picture look deep and artistic. Listening to the album the whole way through made it start to feel repetitive...kind of a one-dimensional listening experience.  Overall, I thought it was OK.  I could listen to it, but I wouldn't pay for the album. And I don't think I could sit through \"Wonderful\" all the way through again.

{"text":"Not a technical critique, this review is more an examination of the change of directions taken by Taylor Swift. I was apprehensive when I first heard \"Safe and Sound\" by Taylor Swift, featuring The Civil Wars. It was not classic Taylor. Then, I saw the video online and became an instant convert. This is the maturing Taylor Swift, which is to be expected. Teamed with The Civil Wars, and written and performed for the movie, \"Hunger Games\", the song and Taylor's performance in the video hits just the right mood. Not an upbeat song, but a comforting one, \"Safe and Sound\" takes Taylor Swift in a new direction. Her voice is more subdued, and the theme of the song is almost melancholy, a reflection of the movie, where hope arises amidst despair and danger. Well done, Taylor!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"In January of 1998, Cher had received the most devastating news she'll ever receive in her lifetime: The Death Of Sonny Bono. Cher was asked to give Sonny's Eulogy at his funeral. Through her grieving tears, Cher had gotten through it.\n\n  On November 10, 1998, Cher had released her next album entitled, BELIEVE. This was the album that brought our Dark Lady back into the game. Throughout the 60s, 70s, & 80s, Cher had been a true Diva, but with this album, Cher's Divahood was etched in stone and there is no way to renounce that. This album is truly amazing, without a doubt. It displays Cher's use of Pop & 90s Retro Disco sound & Club Techno sound. Every fan on this planet, or even in this galaxy should have this album.\n\nBELIEVE\n\n  The first single from the album. And the album's title track. When I heard this song for the first time, I thought to myself, \"Who is singing this song? This song is f***ing awesome\". I knew the voice sounded so familiar, but I couldn't put my finger on it. When the radio DJ said that it was Cher, I nearly had a heartattack. This song is just absolutely incredible. As it would turn out, this song is Cher's fourth #1 hit single.\n\nTHE POWER\n\n  This song is very cool, but it is a little weak.\n\nRUNAWAY\n\n  Why is it every song that I seem to favor never released as a single? This is one of my favorite songs from this album. I cannot help but listen to this song right after hearing the album's title track.\n\nALL OR NOTHING\n\n  The fourth & final single from the album. I had never really listened to this song, until earlier in April of this year. I know I'm late. It was one of those songs that I seemed to have skipped over. But when I actually took the time to listen to the whole song, I was completely mesmorized by how incredible it was.\n\nSTRONG ENOUGH\n\n  The second single from the album. This song is the best example of Cher's use of 1990s Retro Disco sound. I love this song and you all should too. The video for this song is just spectacular, but the blonde hair is not for Cher. For me, Cher's hair color looks best in Black, Rusty Red, or Blood Red.\n\nDov L'AMORE\n\n  The third single from the album. I love Spanish influenced ballads, just like this one. Cher is not the only artist to record a Spanish influenced ballad. Madonna, I think, was the first with \"La Isla Bonita\" & \"Spanish Eyes\". Mariah Carey followed in 1997 with \"My All\". Toni Braxton would have hers in 2000 with \"Spanish Guitar\". This song is just outstanding.\n\nTAKIN' BACK MY HEART\n\n  Pretty much the weakest song on the album.\n\nTAXI TAXI\n\n  The beat is pretty repitious, but it is real catchy and I love it. It is another one of Cher's, \"Get up off your a** and start dancing\" songs.\n\nLOVE IS THE GROOVE\n\n  Another song that should have been released as a single. Damn it! Love this song.\n\nWE ALL SLEEP ALONE (Remix)\n\n  Original version from the album CHER (1987). I am not sure as to why the remix of this song was included her. I guess Cher wanted another Disco sounding song to close out the album and I guess that remixing \"We All Sleep Alone\" was the only song she could think of. Great remix.\n\n  If you are a Cher fan and you do not have this album in your collection, then, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR!?!?! Time is running out. Get this album now, before it's too late.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I didn't get hooked on this CD at once; probably because I expected a battle (well, the first song has a combative title), but this is a coherent band, using the heritage of both bands up until the moment this recording is made, with Duke and Count giving their respective best personal and organizational contributions.\n\nIt is intriguing to listen to the two pianists collaborate with such a great deal of mutual respect and understanding (with the additional attraction of Billy Strayhorn as Ellington's second pair of hands on \"Take the A Train\", a great Strayhorn's composition). Frank Wess' flute seems to blend naturally with Jimmy Hamilton's clarinet; it is a great fun to hear Cat Anderson and Thad Jones working together and to root for Basie's tenorist Frank Foster as he tries to chase Paul Gonsalves (Ellington's tenor sax road runner) across the highway of \"Jumpin at the Woodside\"...\n\n\"To You\", \"Wild Man\", \"BDB\" and other tunes offer many surprises (although not all the moments are equally impressive), with Quentin Jackson (tb) giving great contributions regardless of the fact that, on this album, he comes from Basie's band, instead of his more natural place with Ellington trombone section...\n\nRay Nance is also here, as well as Johnny Hodges, Lawrence Brown, Willie Cook and many others (including the rhythm guitar of Freddie Green), contributing to this great band that uses some very interesting arrangements for this occasion. Not an Ellington record, or a Basie record, this is a great big band album, although novices to swing music should probably start with somewhat more conventional and less extrovert material...","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Okay, the fact that I dug this song out of the Amazon avalanche of available tunes, says it was a five at the outset. I first heard it years ago on local FM, after hearing Black Hole Sun many times (too sludgy for my tastes--and now the erstwhile \"grunge\"\nafficianados will be shooting arrows wrapped in burning flannel soaked in Starbucks at my house--that opinion permanently\nreversed  by hearing Burden In My Hand for the first time). Long sentence. I apologize. How do I describer this?\nI'm told, or heard, that the audience, on hearing Beethoven's Fifth for the first time was stunned to silence--a what\nthe h--- was that? moment. Beethoven's fifth this tune ain't, but after a lot of years, it still surprises, and surprise invokes memory and what is memorable is what makes music last. Don't know about the future of this tune, but it popped back into my head the other day, so I bought it. Up close, no airwaves between us, it still moves. Cornell's (sic?) voice, working like an engine way over its red line sits on top of some really fine musicianship. Which is, first, what brings any band or singer into my\nrange of attention, the skill of the people involved at the craft they've chosen. And it ain't easy, folks. Good job, from a geezer\nwho grew up with the way overvalued music of the sixties.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"We're in a Golden Age of animated motion pictures. When I was a kid growing up in the 1980s you got one, maybe two films from Disney in a calendar year, plus the odd independent movie like Watership Down or The Secret of NIMH, or some arty foreign language thing with bad dubbing, but that was about your lot. Since the Disney renaissance began in 1989 with The Little Mermaid the strength and popularity of the animated feature has grown exponentially, to the point where every major studio has its own animation department, well over a dozen full length feature animations are released each year, and companies like Pixar break box office records with apparent ease. The competition is fierce, but the Dreamworks studio seems to have managed the right blend of hip comedy and family-friendly action, spinning off from their massively successful Shrek series with hits such as Kung Fu Panda, Madagascar, and their 20th and most recent feature, How to Train Your Dragon.\n\nBased on a popular children's book by Cressida Cowell, the film is a tale of Vikings and dragons, set on the island of Berk, where fighting dragons is a way of life. Hiccup, the son of the Viking chief Stoick the Vast, is a brainy outsider with a smart mouth, and would rather not grow up to fight dragons; he is a terrible embarrassment to his father, who in an attempt to `toughen up' the boy, sends to the dragon-fighting school of Gobber the Belch. However, rather than becoming the fearsome warrior his father intended, Hiccup inadvertently saves the life and befriends the dragon he was supposed to kill... The film stars the voice talent of Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson, America Ferrara, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonah Hill, and is directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, who previously directed Lilo & Stitch for Disney in 2002.\n\nMusically, Dreamworks Animation has been the sole domain of Hans Zimmer and his protgs from Media Ventures and now Remote Control since day one. Having already worked on Antz, The Road to El Dorado, Chicken Run, Kung Fu Panda, and the original Shrek movie, English composer John Powell returns for a sixth time - although, ironically, the first time as a sole credited composer - and has written the best score for the studio since Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas back in 2003, and overall one of the best scores of his entire career.\n\nThe first thing I should point out is that, while he is clearly excellent at music, John Powell could do with brushing up on his geography a ltitle. Powell was obviously playing with the joke that the Viking adults in the film are voiced by Scottish actors - Butler and Ferguson - but may have taken it a step too far by injecting the music of the Highlands into his score too. Bagpipes skirl, whistles dance and fiddles fly in a manner unbecoming a noble Scandinavian gentlemen. It could be that Powell used a Swedish sckpipa or a Norwegian Hardanger fiddle and not one of their Celtic cousins from across the North Sea, but there is still a slight, if fleeting, geographical disconnect that occurs, causing a brief moment of puzzlement when the score first begins.\n\nThis small issue aside, the rest of How to Train Your Dragon is an absolute delight. The word which keeps springing to mind when listening to this music is `joyous'. It's music that wows you with stirring action sequences, touches you with more lyrical material, and slaps a big, silly smile on your face from the first cue to the last. John Powell seems to excel at animation scores more than any other type of film he attempts; the level of inventiveness in works such as Robots, the Ice Age series, and his work with Harry Gregson-Williams on Chicken Run and the Shrek series is obvious, but these scores sometimes have a schizophrenic everything-including-the-kitchen-sink approach that can make the album a disjointed affair, jumping from style to style and theme to theme seemingly at random. How to Train Your Dragon is not like that; it flows beautifully from start to finish as a cohesive listening experience, and as such is probably Powell's most satisfying work, in any genre, in years.\n\nThe opening cue, \"This is Berk\", introduces the three score's main themes. It begins with a noble horn performance of what eventually becomes the score's `flying theme', and segues into a sweet woodwind piece for Hiccup and his would-be girlfriend Astrid that recalls the more low-key moments of Chicken Run, before literally exploding into the first performance of the score's main theme, a rousing anthem for the entire orchestra and a male voice choir that is simply magnificent. The large orchestra\/male voice choir\/Scottish instruments combination heard here is basically the blueprint for the entire score, with some variation of one of more of these elements appearing in every cue. The main theme re-occurs regularly throughout the score, receiving notable recapitulations in cues such as \"New Tail\", \"This Time For Sure\" and \"Astrid Goes For a Spin\" to excellent effect. The tender piano performance of the theme in \"Where's Hiccup\" is magical.\n\nThe flying cues, where Hiccup takes to the skies on the back of his scaly friend Toothless, are exhilarating in the best possible way, with the astonishing \"Test Drive\" capturing the spectacular freedom of flight in no uncertain terms. The music in these cues swoops and dives, and opens into expansive statements of the flying theme which are quite thrilling, especially when the bagpipes and an electric guitar join the orchestra. Listening to this music, you can almost feel the wind in your hair, taking your breath away, as you wheel through the skies. Occasionally, in some of these more open moments, the score reminds me of Hummie Mann's vastly underrated score for Year of the Comet, and those few who are familiar with that excellent work will know what a compliment that is.\n\nThe action music is equally superb; energetic, tuneful, creative, and often featuring statements of or more of the main themes. \"Dragon Battle\" has some fearsome low brass chords mixed in with propulsive, urgent rhythmic writing, providing the fire-breathing beasties with a sense of menace and danger. Later cues such as \"The Downed Dragon\", \"Dragon Training\", \"Focus, Hiccup\", \"Dragon's Den\", \"The Kill Ring\" and the astonishingly intense \"Counter Attack\" are no less entertaining, running the gamut of emotions, occasionally tense and nervous, occasionally downright threatening, but often embracing a free-wheeling, carefree vitality that is a pleasure to experience. In each of these cues, the power generated by the orchestra, and the way in which Powell orchestrates each section with such apparent ease, is outstanding.\n\nThe score is not all bombast and histrionics, though. \"Forbidden Friendship\" has a dreamy, almost New Age vibe, with an unusual tick-tock percussion element highlighting marimbas and xylophones, a breathy female vocalist, and even sleigh bells, which gradually reveals itself as a creative variation on the flying theme. \"See You Tomorrow\" is a toe-tapping Highland reel with fluttering pennywhistles forefronting several huge thematic performances, and is probably the closest Powell has come to recapturing the vitality of \"Building the Crate\" from Chicken Run in over a decade (still one of the highlight cues of his career). The romantic theme for Hiccup and Astrid, hints of which appear in the opening cue, is expanded in the glorious, sweeping \"Romantic Flight\", another one of the score's many high points.\n\nThe score's finale, from \"Ready the Ships\" through to \"Coming Back Around\", represents 20 minutes of the best action music of John Powell's entire career. \"Ready the Ships\" had a determined, expectant feeling, although the hocking male voice choirs and martial percussion hits do give way at one point to a more subtle, reflective sequence which is quite lovely. \"Battling the Green Death\" is utterly spectacular, and even has a sequence of Erich Wolfgang Korngold\/Max Steiner-style swashbuckling adventure music which gives the cue a wonderfully nostalgic Golden Age feel. When Powell restates the flying theme at around the 4 minute mark, and in the conclusive \"Coming Back Around\", the music absolutely soars.\n\nPossibly the only misfire on the album is the song at the end of the album, \"Sticks & Stones\" by Jnsi, better known as Jn r Birgisson of the Icelandic rock band Sigur Rs. I like Sigur Rs, and having an actual Scandinavian artist contribute to the project makes sense, but the downbeat introspection and morose style of Birgisson's music seems even gloomier considering the nature of the music that preceded it.\n\nIt's very rare that one can listen to an entire 70+ minute album and honestly say that all of them have musical merit, but that is genuinely the case here. Usually scores of this length have a fair amount of filler, and would benefit from a bit of editorial pruning to get it down to 45-50 minutes, but on How to Train Your Dragon every cue has worth, either through a thematic restatement or a new and interesting texture. What I also like a great deal about this score is the clarity of its sound. Although for a great deal of the running time the entire orchestra is in play, in virtually every cue there is a moment where one specific instrument will come to the fore in a featured performance, just for a couple of bars; the opening cue alone has moments for clarinet and harp that are excellent. Later, in \"The Dragon Book\", a harpsichord pops up playing off brass triplets - and that's just one of literally dozens and dozens of moments throughout the score that make you sit up and take notice.\n\nI'm running out of superlatives now, but I think I've made my point. How to Train Your Dragon is a 5-star score all the way, a fine example of modern film music which reaffirms my faith in John Powell. I have to admit that, in recent years, his Bourne Identity urban thriller style had started to try my patience, and I was beginning to wonder whether the composer who impressed me so much at the turn of the millennium was ever going to come back. Thankfully, he has, and with a score which sets the benchmark for 2010 almost impossibly high. In an already crowded market it's an early contender for score of the year, and anyone who revels in old fashioned thematic orchestral writing will absolutely love it.","classification":5,"fold":3}

For those fans, however,  who loved \"Behaviour\" with its moody mid-tempo tracks that all seemed to blend into a coherent concept album, then you are in for a treat as this is very much the direction \"Elysium\" takes. It is a slow burn that requires repeated listens to understand both the underlying themes \/ lyrics sung as well as to appreciate the minimalist approach to the instrumentation that at times strongly reminds youself of Kanye West cd \"808s and Heartbreak.\" This is acredited to Neil and Chris having picked Kanye's producer Andrew Dawson for this project.\n\nI was disappointed with the choice of \"Winner\" as the lead single (of couse the connection and timing to the Summer Olympics in London made sense) but it is one of the weaker tracks on this cd. \"Leaving\" which will be released in October as the second single is vintage Boys and deserves radio play and a Top 10 position. \"Invisible,\" \"A Face Like That\" and \"Requiem in Denim and the Leopardskin\" demonstrate that even after 26 years they still have the ability to re-invent themselves and create timeless classics.\n\nHow many of today's musical artists can boast 11 studio albums, 3 greatest hits packages and 2 alternate b-side and remix albums! For this they deserve our continued love and support!\n\nUPDATE: The Pet Shop Boys performed an exclusive live concert in Germany last week to promote the album.

{"text":"Cyndi Lauper has been another one of the most successful female solo artists of the early 80s. Her career started to take a fall with the release of 1989 album, A Night To Remember. After the unwanted failure of A Night To Remember (1989). In 1993, Cyndi released another album that failed entitled, Hat Full Of Stars.\n  In 2003, she was able to release, The Essential Cyndi Lauper, her second greatest hits compilation since Twelve Deadly Cyns ...And Then Some (1994). I definitely call it a must-have album.\nGIRLS JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN\n  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). I have loved this song since my years in middle school. I love it's fun-filled energy and I love it's crazed vibe. It's a classic all the way.\nMONEY CHANGES EVERYTHING\n  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). Another great song, but in my opinion, not among the best. I hope you know that it's true that money, in most ways, most certainly does change everything.\nWHO LET IN THE RAIN\n  From the album Hat Full Of Stars (1993). The album Hat Full Of Stars (1993), as for I know, only had three songs I ever liked and they are That's What I Think, Hat Full Of Stars, and Who Let The Rain In. This is a moving ballad and I recommend that you all listen to it.\nSHE BOP\n  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). I still can't get over the fact that this one talks about female masturbation. Nobody wagged their fingers at Cyndi for making a song like this, but if Madonna recorded this song, the critics and parents would have been down her throat. This is a great song. I remember watching Cyndi's Behind The Music on VH1. When they were talking about this track and all the controversey, Cyndi said that her mother called her up and said, \"Is this song about... that?\" I was laughing for days.\nTIME AFTER TIME\n  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). I have always enjoyed this song because of its moving arrangements and vocal arrangements. Everytime I see Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow dance with Alan Cumming to this song in 'Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion', I cry after laughing so hard, even though they did a great job with the choreography. I know shouldn't be laughing because they danced so great, but it's just that they chose a romantic ballad that requires slow-dancing and they decided to use ballet as their dance.\nI DROVE ALL NIGHT\n  From the album A Night To Remember (1989). This is one of the best songs I have heard from Cyndi Lauper and it came from the best album Cyndi Lauper has ever recorded, A Night To Remember. The album did not get the recognition it deserved, it is her best album by far.\nHAT FULL OF STARS\n  From the album Hat Full Of Stars (1993). Another great song from the Hat Full Of Stars album. I knew from the moment I read the title that it would be a great song and I was right. I love it when I'm right.\nCHANGE OF HEART\n  From the album True Colors (1986). This is one of the three songs from the True Colors (1986) album that I like. The True Colors (1986) album is not a favorite album of mine, all though I love the front and back covers of that album. This song has a great vibe to it and the lyrics are well-written. Cyndi's voice was amazing on this one to begin with, but The Bangles', who provided back-ups, vocals thicken Cyndi's voice, making her voice sound like it has more enthusiasm.\nSISTERS OF AVALON\n  From the album Sisters Of Avalon (1997). This is a good song, but it's not like her original sound. If she decided to change her sound, she shouldn't have made it sound like this. I know she has the talent to better than this.\nALL THROUGH THE NIGHT\n  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). This is another song with a moving sound. The vocals are incredible, the music is incredible. Who would not love this song, except for people with no brains?\nWHEN YOU WERE MINE\n  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). Although, this is a great song, I don't like the fact that it was originally done by Prince. I literally hate Prince with a passion. In my opinion, he's a great lyricist, but he and his music can go straight to hell because I can't stand him or his music.\nTRUE COLORS\n  From the album True Colors (1986). The second of three songs I like from the True Colors (1986) album. The guitar arrangements are incredible.\nUNHOOK THE STARS\n  From the album Sisters Of Avalon (1997). She did reinvent her sound for the Sisters Of Avalon (1997) album and not well at all. This is a song I always skip. I can't waste my time listening to a song that sounds like crap.\nTHE GOONIES 'R' GOOD ENOUGH\n  From the original motion picture & soundtrack The Goonies (1985). The Goonies has always been one of my favorite movies. The movie was filmed and released in 1985, the year that I was born. It's hard for me to believe that this movie is as old as I am and I still get a kick out of it. This song is amazing and Cyndi was the right choice to record it. The movie, original motion picture score, and this song all remind me of Wildwood, New Jersey. I don't know why, it just happened. This is one of the best songs from Cyndi Lauper and I'm happy to know that it was included in this incredible collection.\n  If you are a Cyndi Lauper fan, then you need to buy a copy of this collection. It's worth all the money you pay and you are guaranteed to be impressed.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Excerpt from my review of the album released with this song: \"Vigil starts soft and romantic like the title suggests, and then picks up momentum about half-way through and finishes again on a slow note. For fans of the movies (The Lord of the Rings), the song reflects the various ups and downs of the fantastic story in fine style.\"\nThis piece mixes the elements of a slower piece, with the power of a more majestic piece. It builds and crescendos in the middle giving it the momentum it needs to keep you going after it drops back into the soft finish.\nWith this song as an 'introduction', it's no wonder their release of, \"The Lord of the Rings\" was such a success.\n...now... will there be a video for this one eventually?","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Since his last release, Farish changed residences from the East to the West.  The Norfolk, Virginia native moved to Los Angeles late last year, a big change of scenery him and his wife. Farish explained to his fans that he wanted to be on the west coast to pursue a career as a successful music composer and become involved in movie projects. Farish's use of vocal arrangements on the various tracks such as \"The Promise\" is a refreshing chance of pace from his previous releases. It shows his diverse musical talents. He also uses South African vocal arrangements in the track, \"Rejoice!\" Listening to this CD gives me extreme pride and joy. Its soothing melodies are uplifting and inspirational.  Much like last year's Top 5 Smooth Jazz and More selection \"Beautiful\", \"From the Sky\" will be a CD at the top of this year's \"best of\" list as well.  Farish is a talented musician and a future star in the music world.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Mumford And Sons have given music a much needed kick in the butt by proving you don't need to be a synthed out dance band to sell to a big audience. It's helped bands like Avett Brothers, Trampled by Turtles and more reach a wider listener-ship and helped reestablish Americana and roots music in the USA. And that's a good thing in my mind. \"Babel\" is their second full length CD, and it follows the slow-burn success of \"Sigh No More,\" as well as finding the band in a tough situation. How do you appease this new found audience who look upon you as the newest and next big thing without disappointing them?\n\nIn response, \"Babel\" loads up on the bombast and the religion. Think U2 with banjos, with the bulk of the songs also having a soft\/loud\/soft\/explode variety of songwriting that owes as much to grunge than folk-rock. There's way too much \"Jesus saved me\" here for my tastes, yet the disc overall is pretty darn great. There's a lot of soul in Marcus Mumford's voice and he's happy to pour it on with all the force he can muster (the title track) or in longing (\"I Will Wait\")or cries for salvation (\"Whispers in The Dark\"). As the band rises and swells behind him, Mumford's voice carries the emotional wallop of the lyrics he's penned with ease. Add some otherworldly harmonies and you have the makings for greatness.\n\nThere isn't much subtlety in that manner of music making, but the emphasis here is on the rock part of Folk-Rock. There's a hunger for this kind of honesty in music and \"Babel\" gives sustenance.","classification":4,"fold":3}
{"text":"Call me a purist but as much as I love Eric Clapton, I am partial to Bob Dylan's rendition of this song. Not only do I like the sound better but Bob Dylan wrote the song.

{"text":"See with Jaheim, ive noticed the man can not make bad music. Every album he has put out has been at least good, and excellent at his best. And that continues with Makings of A Man. I think Ja made a good choice in switching record labels and going to Atlantic, because at Warner he wasn't getting any promotion. This was the first time i had to go to 2 different stores to find the damn album, because they were sold out at the first store. Jaheim is a breath of fresh air in the state of R&B right now. Because most of the R&B being put out right now revolves around Sex, partying, and drugs. And some of that is ok in small doses but to make a whole album around that gets old real fast. But Ja knows how to balance his albums between Love & Sex. He doesnt over do it on this album, along with any of his other albums. But the biggest thing that i think helped him in the move to Atlantic, was that it introduced him to some new and better producers. This is the first time a Ja album has actually had a more contempary feel to it. Like the stellar Babyface written \"Just Don't Get It\", this is totally different than the Ja we are used to. This song totally sounds like it could be on the radio. Excellent track. Like on the R. Kelly produced \"Hush\" where Ja reminices about how he had an affair with his best friends girl. This album is alot different sounding than his previous albums, but its a good thing. While \"Never\" could possibly be played at weddings, he can still do songs that the thugs can feel to like \"Life of a Thug\". And the other thing that i really like about this album (This might sound weird), is that he released it in December. Which in my opinion is the perfect time for him to release an album because in winter, i always find myself listening to his albums. I don't know what it is but during the winter his music just does it for me when i am driving around. Not that during the summer or whatever i don't like him, but during the winter i always make sure to have at least one of his albums in the car with me at all times. I think it could be his just smooth but jagged vocals that just warms the air during the winter that makes his music so attractive during the winter season. And we all know Ja can blow, unless you are new to Ja, now is the perfect time to introduce yourself. And this album will be in heavy rotation for quite some time because it is just as good as his previous albums, if not better. Another hit for Jaheim... as usual!\n\nGrade:\nB+","classification":4,"fold":3}

For a period that spanned roughly half a decade (1958-1964) folk music emerged from the coffee houses and college campuses of this nation and became an integral part of the mainstream music scene. Some of this music was quite intense but most of the songs that made it to the airwaves were light and upbeat. The Rooftop Singers were a folk group from New York City led by Erik Darling. Darling had been a member of The Tarriers (\"Cindy, Oh Cindy\" and \"The Banana Boat Song\") in 1956 and later on sang with The Weavers for a few years. In early 1963 the folk label Vanguard released the single \"Walk Right In\" which was a very fine folk update of a 1929 country blues song written by musician Gus Cannon and originally recorded by Cannon's Jug Stompers. The song turned out to be one of the biggest hits of the folk era spending a couple of weeks high atop the Billboard Hot 100. Over the years \"Walk Right In\" has been recorded by dozens of artists across a number of genres. The Rooftop Singers' version appears on the soundtrack of the Tom Hanks film \"Forrest Gump\".  This is the original recording you would remember from the radio.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I can think of only a few musical artists who can do whatever the bleep they want and not lose fans, and may even gain some when they step out of their usual style. I can think of Van Morrison, Willie Nelson, Tony Bennett, Yo Yo Ma, and Dolly Parton. There is no question that Bob Dylan is at or near the top of that list. Thus we have \"Fallen Angels.\" I admit, while I usually buy Dylan the moment new stuff comes out, I had no interest in his last album, which contained covers of songs made famous by Frank Sinatra. That was not because of Dylan; it was because I just don't like Frank Sinatra. This album, \"Fallen Angels\", comprised of mainstream standards written by some of this country's greatest songwriters of the 30's up into the early 60's. This album works. This album is a great album.\nOn \"Fallen Angels\", Dylan surrounds himself with a small group of very talented musicians. To a certain degree it has the \"live in the studio\" feel. I admit I was surprised by how good Dylan's voice sounded, given the obvious deterioration over his last few new albums. I was also impressed with his phrasing and elocution of the lyrics. The man really can sing, that talent often hidden by the power of his own lyrics and the quality of the music produced by whatever band with which he is working.\nI listened to the entire album about five times before I felt ready to write this review. It was on my most recent listen, as \"Young At Heart\" was playing, that I realized that Bob was really \"into\" this music and that he sang such that it was clear to me he believed the words he was singing. I think that song in particular is fitting for BD as he celebrates his 75th birthday. The quality of the album is very even, in production, in song choice, in arrangements and in performance. For that reason, I find it hard to pick out any particular tracks as \"standouts\" on this album. I will say that in addition to \"Young At Heart,\" I particularly enjoyed his renditions of \"That Old Black Magic\", \"Come Rain or Come Shine,\" \"All or Nothing at All,\" and\n\"Melancholy Mood.\"\nThis is a very good album and increases our appreciation of Dylan as the gift to the music world that he is. Highest recommendation.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Starts off great, gets bad real quick.\nSome of the biggest names in R&B (or urban music if you read the insert) right now are on it, with some strong newcomers.  The Erykah Badu song is a powerful ballad of laziness and better than almost everything on her \"Mama's Gun\" record.  Rookie Glen Lewis gives us the strongest song on the CD, \"Don't You Forget It\", which is the track they're using in the TV commercials.  When his record finally drops (11\/2001) I'll get it on the strength of tis track.\nThe only other standout tracks belong to India. Arie, who gives us a great track in the tone of the stuff on her album, but smoothed around the edges, \"Butterfly\"; and Jill Scott, who's offering is, sadly, a remix of a song we've already been inundated with over the past year, so it already sounds old once the laser hits the disc.  Jill can do no wrong with me, but this was a mistake.  It's a cool track, but we could do with something new about now.  Fortunately, she's dropping a double album this month as well to make up for it, so I'll be content soon enough.\nThe rest of the album is abhorrent.  Macy Gray (whom I never liked anyway) is even worse here.  I'd rather hear her sing the National Anthem again.  The new cats on the rest of the disc don't lift off, and even vets like the indestructable Amel Larrieux and the Roots don't keep up the groove of the record.  After about the 5th track, you're in for some rough riding, buddy.\nThe tracks by Glen Lewis, Badu and Arie are almost wort the disc, though.  Almost, except that lewis's track will likely be on his CD anyway, and Arie will probably put this track on her next record as well, so you'll end up with the best stuff one way or another.","classification":2,"fold":3}

She had been absent from making music for quite a long time, not just on her own, but also with No Doubt. Last year, the group returned after nearly a decade from making catchy songs. They didn't hit the nail on the head they had wanted with Settle Down. The song was good, but not as strong as what they had before. Baby Don't Lie, Gwen's latest solo song isn't, bad honestly not overwhelming. The song is catchy, but not as good as her earlier songs from her career Sweet Escape, Rich Girl, Hollaback Girl and others to name a few. Still, it is a decent song, and definitely much better than the songs than Katy Perry had came out with, trying to deliver the same striking vibe that Gwen had shown. Hopefully, Gwen can come out with other song a bit better than this one was. This one doesn't lie, but could use a bit more to the heart.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":3}

That may soon change.\n\nDavid Archuleta has produced a Christmas CD that is, if not better, at least in the same league as the Carpenters Christmas music. His voice is mesmorizing and soul-piercing. What an amazing recording this is.

{"text":"In the same year that Grunge was well and truly selling billions of CDs worldwide, US Heavy Metal legends Manowar released their seventh full-length studio album  1992s The Triumph Of Steel.\n\nIt must have been no easy task following up their immensely popular and loyally beloved 1988 release Kings Of Metal, nor must it have been easy having to train up a new drummer and guitarist after losing Scott Columbus and Ross The Boss Friedman. In fact, nor can it have been fun trying to promote an album of blistering, powerful, OTT Heavy Metal after Man In The Box and Smells Like Teen Spirit changed what mustve felt like every journalist on earths priorities in the pre-internet culture of the day.\n\nDespite all that was going against them, Manowar released what must surely be one of their greatest ever albums (certainly its my personal favourite at any rate). Call it ambition, or call it arrogance, but the band even opened up the record with a twenty-minute long song. A song with a bass solo, a drum solo so indulgent that it has a separate solo for the cymbals and for the drums, two minutes of somber guitar violining all telling the story of Achillies and Hector from Greek Mythology. The world wanted Touch Me Im Sick Manowar gave em Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts.\n\nDespite how easy it is to skip a twenty-minute album opener with three solos in it, the song isn't poor. In fact, some sections of it are absolute genius, such as the furious Thrashy Death Hectors Reward part, which feels like the musical equivalent of being battered upside the head.\n\nAfter that, the first normal-length track comes in. Its my favourite track on the album, or by the band. Metal Warriors is the most perfectly-pitched, sing-along tribute to Heavy Metal thats ever been written. Ludicrous to the point of featuring the lyric If you're not into Metal you are not my friend and yet musically out of this world. Its some kind of supercharged version of Kiss I Love It Loud filled with Painkiller screams, mountain-top chants and the screech of guitars that feel only-barely in control.\n\nTheres more blistering speed, in the sword-and-scorcery realm of Ride The Dragon with its constant double-kicks and incredibly catchy chorus.\n\nThe band then take a different tack, choosing to sing about Native Americans in a surprisingly tasteful way, in an interesting mid-paced affair that sonically evokes cowboy movies subtly, but doesnt loose that Manowar sound. Maybe they were jealous of Anthrax? Who cares why they did it, but it works, really well!\n\nThen they follow it up with another mid-paced track called Burning which youd imagine might be a momentum killer, but is actually one of the more interesting compositions in the bands catalogue. Its a bit different than their usual any of their usual directions epics, ballads, rousing anthems or blistering speed. Its a nice change of pace. Sort of experimental, with a lot of emphasis on dynamics and Eric Adams trying out as many vocal techniques as he can imagine.\n\nPower Of Thy Sword comes next, and its what I would consider the quintessential Manowar song. If you wonder if the band are for you, this is one of the tracks you should use to decide. Its got everything thats great about the band in spades. Its so powerful, OTT and fun. Its beyond catchy, the solo is awesome, theres slow bits, fast bits and theres a touch of the orchestral epic-ness that the band aspire to. With this one song, you get a good musical, technical and lyrical picture of Manowar oh, and by the way its a great song too!\n\nEven if the last one felt good enough to be an album closer, it doesnt stop there. Theres more Metal in the form of The Demons Whip. A robust, interesting track which is half crushing Sabbath-inspired Doom and half double-kick Thrash attack, almost-ending the album with a jarring reverse-whiplash effect as the too-slow doom accelerates out of control to the tune off way-too-loud whip samples.\n\nIt all closes with the grand, cinematic, vocally-impressive Master Of The Wind which kind of evokes Greg Lake-era King Crimson with its chiming bells, big reverb, dynamic production and haunting singing. Its probably the best ballad\/orchestral-track that Manowar ever did. Not something to be skipped, but a genuine album highlight in itself.\n\nOverall; Triumph Of Steel is a really diverse and almost strange album. Despite its seeming lack of focus, it really feels like Manowar just doing everything they could think of to absolute perfection. Anthem  nailed. Ballad  absolutely nailed. Fast bits  nailed. Slow bits  nailed. Exploring new ideas  nailed. Keeping true to what makes Manowar, Manowar  nailed. It might not have gotten the attention it deserved at the time, but for my money this album is a straight up-and-down masterpiece that shows what superb musicians, performers and songwriters Manowar are from every possible angle. Highly Recommended!","classification":5,"fold":3}

Some say it is expensive well, try The recent Moody Blues box set which is larger & got that one but as a collector, we do such foolish things. On the other hand if this one is a bit too much to take in, there are all those \"Best Of\" collections out there. Back to this box set, I really love the early stuff myself, and this packs some punch there, the \"Live\" material is good but to me their studio versions are the ticket here. One later track on CD 4 \"It's A Beautiful Day\" is the edit version, I have the regular edit and why they put this version is really a question mark to me, anyway, a few other tracks I question as well since it is a box set they could have changed things up from some of the mono recording to stereo ones. Don't get me wrong, love the mono versions but those are easily found on compilations. So in conclusion, if your a hardcore fan \/ collector, a must have like the other three box sets by them out, if your a casual fan, the best of collections out there are fine, but if you want everything in one place basically, this one is the one to get folks!\nDrop by my website sometime @ \"JudeMac Forever\" and look around, always something there for someone. google it.","classification":5,"fold":3}

My daughter is studying the violin, so this album is inspiring for her.\n\nRegardless of whether you are a musician or just an avid music lover, this album is a nice addition to your music collection.\n\nThe price is equally outstanding.

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I'm not generally a fan of Michael Buble, but must admit, I was impressed with the song I just haven't met you yet.  Somehow he took his style, a very oldschool frank sinatra type, and found a way to make it feel fresh and new.  Unlike his usual work, it doesn't feel like an homage to the old, but rather someone making something new, but using the tools of those before.  Very unique and very well done.  Also, its very catchy, every once in a while I'll start singing along in my car Highly recomended.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Finally free from record companies, contracts, and the like; Nine Inch Nails mastermind Trent Reznor has unleashed \"Ghosts I-IV\", an entire album of instrumental work.  As a longtime NIN fan, I personally was a little apprehensive when I first approached \"Ghosts\", but thankfully, I ended up being pretty satisfied.  Tracks 22, 24, and 28 in particular are the most memorable moments to be heard here, as there are some great uses of the piano (!) to be heard that are peppered throughout the album.  Although at times \"Ghosts\" borderlines on self-indulgence, as a whole, the album is a real treat, and is a welcome departure from Nine Inch Nails' usual brand of discontent.  Clocking in at under two hours in length, \"Ghosts\" moves along without ever really feeling that long at all.  All in all, \"Ghosts I-IV\" is a more than welcome cry of freedom from Trent Reznor and co., and with more \"Ghosts\" promised to be appearing in the future, here's hoping that Nine Inch Nails continue to climb new heights of creativity.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Amy Winehouse's sophomore release \"Back To Black\" has received an incredible amount of critical praise and most of it is quite deserved. Her voice, songwritting, production harkons back to the days of a strange in theory but complementary combination of raw emotion and a Motown production. There are some touches of reggae and ska, but at the end of the day it's all about Winehouse's delivery, which some have described as Shirley Bassey meets Billie Holliday. Quite a lot to live up to, and, as is the case with many good releases, the critics go overboard with praise to then knock essentially the same artist to the ground.\n\nIn my view Amy certainly sounds like a singer from another generation and if you are looking for a pristine perfect pitch voice, she may not be up your alley. Maybe she will is you like a little more than the great pipes of say Christina Aguilera. While I like some of Christina's work, the perfect pitch always benefits when she digs deeper than just hitting notes. Amy sings in a smoky confessional style that leaves her with very little to hide behind. The genius here is that the production manages to sound very, very old school but not in a strictly mimicky fashion, but more as a point of departure.\n\nIt took me 3 good listens to really fall for this release, which I would give 5 stars to if the US version had (for whatever reason) not included the amazing \"Addicted\" (which closes the UK version) and stuck us with a ridiculous 2 rate remix of the already single worthy \"You Know I am No Good.\" Said song does nothing but add unispired male rap that feels like a crude attempt to include somthing not to lose the \"kids.\" Good music is good music and some of the very best stuff out there does not rely on tired formulas of grabbing any artist (whether a classic like Patty Labelle or someone like Mariah Carey) and trying to \"ghetto\" a release for wider mass appeal. Rap has a place in music and should not be cut and pasted into new or older artists in order to sound contemporary.\n\nSo listen to songs 1- 10, skip 11, and if we are lucky we'll get to hear \"Addicted\" somewhere down the line. I am amazed that this release is doing as well as it is and it just may be that people want to hear something different priced within reach. Some have taken issue with Amy's first single \"Rehab\" as it seems to make light of a serious alcohol\/drug problem that Amy may have. She fired her previous handler who had a role in trying to get her alcohol\/drug free and the song could be interpreted as saying that her emotional emancipation came from refusing to be \"controlled.\" I obviously cannot opine on this matter, but that is why in part this release may have a parental guidance sticker on it. I generally don't like any third party to get in the way of the things that I may enjoy, but here I mention it only as this is def. an adult release talking about adult matters.\n\nEnjoy the release for its own merits and let's not put it on a pedesal of perfection as it simply is a great release from a singer who got it right. Thanks to all the great people who give valuable input and to those who have writen. This forum can be quite amazing when used for more than fans giving 0 or 5 stars without letting us know why they thought that it was so good or worse than death.","classification":4,"fold":3}

A couple of years ago after I established my Laketon Crossing website, I wrote a blog about what gave me the strength to do that. I wanted to help others shrug off the terrible yoke of addiction. I highlighted most of my blogs with a link to a song that emphasized musically the point I was making with the written word, and chose The Rainbow Connection for that specific blog to demonstrate the spiritual aspect of my success. https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/newlaketon\/home\/rainbow\nI also added the song to my iTunes collection and chose  Sarah McLachlan's version because it is quite simply the best out there.  This song is a theme song for life. Bless Paul Williams and Kenneth Ascher for writing it, Sarah McLachlan for singing it, Amazon for making it available in a quick download and the song itself for making me - and hopefully others - understand that we all have addictions of one sort or another but it is possible to walk away from one that is destroying you.","classification":5,"fold":3}

When Jay Black joined Jay and the Americans in 1963 he persuaded the group to rework the song and include it in their \"live\" performances.  Finally in the spring of 1965 United Artists records agreed to have the guys record it and to release it as a single.  And as they say the rest is history.  The song reached number 4 on the Billboard pop chart.

The results are worth the long wait (well, we would have liked something sooner of course, but now that it's here I think his fans are grateful to receive it!).\n\nHe sounds as good as ever, as you would expect from a singer who has continued to tour and give concerts pretty much continuously for the past several decades, and it's still James with his soft clear voice in this selection of ten songs. In fact it almost sounds like the 1970's again. Nine of the songs are brand new James Taylor compositions, and those make up the first nine tracks of the album. The final track, Wild Mountain Thyme. is a folk song written by Francis McPeake that has been widely covered over the years and is very beautifully performed here.\n\nThe album was recorded mostly at the Barn, the recording studio near to his home, and in producing this recording he's brought together many of his longstanding musical collaborators including Michael Landau (guitar), Larry Goldings (keyboards), Luis Conte (percussion), Steve Gadd (drums) and Jimmy Johnson (bass). It was produced by Dave O'Donnell, who's also been associated with James for many years.\n\nThere are also some special guests together with James for several of the songs:\n\n- track 2, `You and I Again': Yo-Yo Ma on cello\n- track 3, `Angels of Fenway': harmony vocals by James's wife Kim and son Henry\n- track 8, `Before This World\/Jolly Springtime': Yo-Yo Ma on cello, Sting harmony vocals\n- track 10, `Wild Mountain Thyme': harmony vocals by James's wife Kim and son Henry\n\nThemes of the songs on this album are also familiar to those of us who are longtime fans of James - `Watchin' Over Me' (recovery, and a personal reflection on James's own years fighting the demons of depression and substance abuse); `You and I Again' (love song); `Stretch of the Highway' (traveling); `Today, Today, Today' (working); `Far Afghanistan' (war).\n\nThe album times in at just under 42 minutes, perhaps roughly comparable to a live set if you were hearing James at a concert. He put a great deal of effort into the collection of songs that is included here, and the sequence that they are presented, in order to provide the listening experience exactly the way he wanted it. It was worth the effort, and listening to the album from beginning to end, there is nothing discordant about how the music flows from one song to the other. Each of the songs has a specific meaning, and the overall experience is, well, it sounds just like a James Taylor album should sound! It's great to hear him as good as ever (at age 67!).\n\nThis album also includes a nicely produced booklet, which begins with a note from James discussing the music on the album, and includes lyrics for each song, along with photos throughout. It's very well done as well.\n\nCOMMENT regarding the various editions of this album:\n\nAs can be seen on this Amazon page, this can be purchased as a CD, or as a CD plus DVD, or as a super-deluxe package that includes a book and other neat stuff.\n\nI have the CD plus DVD that I purchased at Target (sorry, Amazon!), and it also has a feature that isn't available with any of the versions offered here, three 'bonus' tracks that are exclusive to Target. (I've seen this before with other music CD's that have exclusive Wal-Mart editions as well, so James is not the first to have a special version of a CD that is offered via one of the big chains here in the U.S.)\n\nFor those who might be curious regarding what is included with the Target edition, here are the three additional tracks along with some explanatory information:\n\n- Track 11: Pretty Boy Floyd -- written by Woody Guthrie, recorded in Nashville with Mark Knopfler and Chuck Ainlay in 1999 at the same session that was planned to work on October road and produced the song Sailing to Philadelphia where James accompanied Mark. That song appeared on the album of the same name:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sailing-to-Philadelphia\/dp\/B00004Y6Q0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sailing to Philadelphia<\/a>.\n- Track 12: I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You) -- written by Hank Williams (James says it 'has always been my favorite Hank Williams song'), recorded in 2003 with Danny Kortchmar on electric guitar accompanying James.\n- Track 13: Diamond Joe -- traditional, recorded in Nashville at the same session where track 11 above was recorded.\n\nThese additional tracks bring the total time of the CD to 54 minutes.\n\nAdded note 6\/23\/15: It looks like the Target edition of this CD is now being offered by a few of the third-party sellers here on Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Before-This-World-Expanded-Deluxe-Edition-ndash-3-Bonus-Tracks-DVD\/dp\/B00ZS6OE94\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Before This World (Expanded Deluxe Edition &ndash; 3 Bonus Tracks + DVD)<\/a>.","classification":5,"fold":3}

Not that other holidays have no music associated with them; however, every year when Christmas comes around, so does the onslaught of Christmas music that seems to play in so many different public places.\n\nAlthough this \"free sampler\" (which, strangely, appears to cost 99 cents a song) does not reinvent the wheel in terms of Christmas music, for what it is (a brief, four song collection that equates to about fifteen minutes of music), you will do pretty well here.\n\nThe International Children's Choir performs an angelic rendition of \"Jingle Bells\".  The Berlin Symphony Orchestra turns in an expert rendition of \"The Nutcracker\", injecting new life into an old standard and is the longest performance here, at almost seven minutes.  Capella Gregoriana performs a stunning accapella rendition of \"Gloria in excelsis deo\".  \"Silent Night, Holy Night\" is the most mellow, soothing track here, performed by Budapest Strings and Karoly Botvay, featuring some fantastic harmony work not commonly heard on this carol.\n\nThis sampler will have broad appeal for those looking for festive music, but those who [enjoy] are bent for classical music will undoubtedly get the most enjoyment from this small selection of holiday musical fare.","classification":5,"fold":3}

His eighth album still offers some edgy and forceful vocals, but starts out with several tunes whose arrangements of piano, organ, strings and studio drums resound with Nashville's overbearing contemporary country-rock sound. Allan's relegated his superior original material to the album's second-half, opening the album with songs from Music City pros whose work leaves a more calculated impression. The productions on the first few cuts overwhelms Allan's earthiness, and even the sprightly \"That Ain't Gonna Fly\" sounds more like a studio band attempting to rock than a country band actually rocking.\n\nBut the mainstream sound fades away when the album reaches Allan's original material at track six. The intimate details of \"We Fly by Night,\" co-written with Jamie O'Hara and Odie Blackmon, are given a stately tempo that allows Allan to consider the lyrics and add an echo of Roy Orbison's drama. Or maybe it's an echo of Raul Malo, as Dan Dugmore's steel and gentle notes of vibraphone give this track a compelling sophistication. Allan writes poetically of opening up to opportunities, begging for forgiveness and finding oneself, and the emotion with which he sings his own words is a world away from what he's able to muster for the album's stock Nashville compositions. Perhaps his label didn't trust that Allan's originals were radio-ready, but his songs are deeper and feel as if they're born of personal experience rather than someone else's songwriting appointment.\n\nThos who liked&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/See-If-I-Care\/dp\/B0000CD5HG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">See If I Care<\/a>&nbsp;might skip lightly through the first five tracks, as the album's second half is a twangy and soulful gem worth the wait. The deluxe CD edition adds four bonus cuts: the newly recorded \"Long Summer Days,\" and live versions of \"Right Where I Need to Be,\" \"Best I Ever Had,\" and \"Watching Airplanes\" that were recorded in front of an enthusiastic audience. The disc (which also unlocks on-line video content) is delivered in a digipack with a 16-panel booklet that includes lyrics to the album's core ten tracks. Allan is effective in playing both the country mainstream and its rootsier edges, which may leave some fans enjoying one half of this disc more than the other.

{"text":"The album picks up George's career where the boxed set (Strait out of the box) ends, so it covers the period from 1994 to 1998. It shows that George's style was evolving but still firmly rooted in traditional country music.\n\nThe album opens with two songs specially recorded for the album, the first (The best day) being an excellent ballad. The second song (Murder on music row) was first written and recorded by Larry Cordle, a bluegrass performer. Here, George sings it as a duet with Alan Jackson. George rarely sings duets but although there is no obvious reason for this particular song to be a duet, George and Alan clearly enjoyed recording this song. While both George and Alan have made some concessions to the requirements of the contemporary market place, they have both managed to be hugely successful with music that is much closer to traditional country music than most of the music recorded in Nashville these days.\n\nThe remaining tracks are taken from just four albums, these being Lead on (Adalida, Lead on, You can't make a heart love somebody), Blue clear sky (the title track, Carried away, I can still make it to Cheyenne, King of the mountain), Carrying your love with me (the title track, Round about way, One night at a time, Today my word slipped away) and One step at a time (True, We really shouldn't be doing this). Of these songs, Today my world slipped away is a cover of a Vern Gosdin country hit but the others (as far as I know) are original songs.\n\nPicking out highlights in such a strong collection is difficult, but I'll nominate Murder on Music Row, Adalida, Blue clear sky and King of the mountain. If you are new to George's music, this compilation makes a great introduction.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Randy Newman has written many brilliant songs, but SAIL AWAY may well be his finest album.  The 2-minute \"Political Science\" is certainly one of his greatest achievements, and the song is just as timely now as it was in 1973.  What makes the lyric so great is that it distills exactly what so many Americans think about the world.  It could be your friendly next-door neighbor, who seems like a perfectly nice person until you stumble into a  political discussion, and then you realize that he is an immoral monster.  It seems to me that \"Political Science\" should be the national anthem -- it's what large numbers of Americans  really think, and if they disagree then they should be forced to change the attitude as well as the policies before they change the song.\n\n I would like to include the entire lyric, but here is a sample:\n\n \"We give them money, but are they grateful, no they're spiteful and they're hateful.  They don't respect us, so let's surprise 'em, let's drop The Big One and pulverize 'em.\"\n\n \"Boom goes London, and boom Pay-ree, more room for you and more room for me.  Every city the whole world round will just be another American town, oh how peaceful it will be, we'll set everybody free ... They all hate us anyhow, so let's drop The Big One now.\"\n\n Is Randy Newman being too sarcastic, too harsh?  Just look at the anti-French movement among the republicanus neanderthalis recently -- \"nuke France and gimme some Freedom Fries with my burger\" -- and it seems clear that if anything he is too kind.\n\n Thank goodness for Randy Newman in times like these.  Along with Mose Allison, Stan Ridgway (see my 7\/29\/04 review of his brilliant latest, SNAKEBITE), and a few other mavericks, he understands America's dark side well enough to deflate its pretensions and hypocrisy  with humor, from the inside.","classification":5,"fold":3}

While she does have might feel like she have a domiant vibe with younger audiences, she unfortunately doesn't have a strong appeal. Her second single from her debut album Animat, Blah Blah, Blah feels like a waste on the ears. While the beat isn't very strong, the feeling of her voice and the lyrics to the sound is absolutely horrible. I wasn't very amused with the single, and I felt it was not a good song. If she really is going to deliver, she should try harder with a better song that is all her own.\n\nSong: D 1\/2-","classification":2,"fold":3}

{"text":"\"Smoke on the Water,\" originally from the great Deep Purple album \"Machine Head,\" has one of the most iconic riffs in all of rock courtesy of Ritchie Blackmore and his Strat. Easily the most recognizable and popular song from Deep Purple's catalogue, the song chronicles an actual event. In December 1971 Deep Purple was in Montreux, Switzerland to record an album at the Montreux Casino next to Lake Geneva using mobile recording equipment owned by the Rolling Stones. During a Frank Zappa concert on December 4, a fan set off a flare gun, setting the ceiling on fire and burning the complex to the ground. The flames and smoke drifted over the lake, while the members of Deep Purple watched. The band then had to scramble for a venue to record \"Machine Head\" in, and finally settled on the Montreux Grand Hotel. The song is quite an accurate piece of history, and definitely one of the heaviest, most listenable pieces of musical history ever recorded.\n\nThe song has appeared in various versions (the most amusing is from Pat Boone's \"In a Metal Mood,\" with Blackmore reprising his role on guitar) on many albums. I recommend \"Machine Head,\" but the \"Best Hits\" album is also a good buy at a reasonable price. One thing's certain, though: no musical library should be without this staple.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Hard to believe that it has been over 30 years since Sting had started his successful solo career, after he had said goodbye to The Police. Honestly, the songs that Sting has done on his own all this time, absolutely stand taller than just the days of Punk he had with Stewart and Andy. Sting has made some really remarkable songs, and they are definitely much better than the jokes that are on radio today, who do not even have a sliver of the soul that Sting has had for years in music. One of my favorite songs Sting came out with back in the 90's, Desert Rose is one of those melodic and spiritual songs that still is very upbeat and hypnotic to the soul that still sounds just as driven today, as you would expect from Sting himself. I have loved this song for years, and it still strikes at the heart of the matter as one of his best songs ever. It is just too sad that the stars of today, well the overexposed jokes of Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna, cannot even have a single song that can drive from the bloom of the flower like Sting has. If you have never even heard a Sting song before, well this is one of my Top 5 picks from his illustrious works of art that I suggest that you do go to.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"The ethereal sound was created by laboriously building up multiple overdubs of the voices of Stewart, Graham Gouldman, Godley and Creme singing a single note in unison. This multi-track was then mixed and dubbed down onto 16-track tape. This process was repeated across all 16 tracks to create a lush 256-voice \"virtual\" choir that could \"sing\" chromatic chords.[2] A number of these prepared multi-tracks were then cut into several endless loops, each of which contained the basic notes of the main chords used in the song. The chorus loops could then be played by using the mixing desk rather like a keyboardeach chord could be sounded by bringing up the fader for that loop. The instrumental break featured the repeated spoken phrase, \"Big boys don't cry...\", spoken by Kathy Warren, the receptionist of their own Strawberry Studios where the band recorded the track. These whispered lyrics would later serve as the inspiration for Brit  group, The Cure, who had an album and song called Boys Don't Cry. Axl Rose has also stated that this is one of his favorites which inspired him to get into music.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I can't give this album a full 5 stars, but it's close, and certainly a classic of its type.  Not many artists could pull off a rather loose \"jam\" session and have it hold up as well as this has.  It just shows how much class and talent Al Kooper has.  Tough enough, but how about when Mike Bloomfield fails to show on the 2nd day of the sessions, and Al has to recruit Steve Stills at literally the last minute.  All things considered, it's amazing that this album even saw the light of day, much less that it is considered a sort of classic of its type.\n\nBut let's explore that.  Among jazz musicians, jam sessions are quite normal, but it's usually a bit different for rock musicians.  In this case, Al was as much of a jazz afficiando as he was blues, soul and rock, so he probably relished the idea to get Bloomfield and a good rhythm section, a couple of tunes he and Mike wanted to cover, and see what would happen.  They did exactly that (at least for one day) and the results are pretty impressive.  There are a few miscues: The phasing on \"You Don't Love Me\" is very dated and gets annoying quickly.\n\nBut still, if you can overlook the quirks and the obvious holes that are inevitably going to be there, there is a great spirit to this set.  Sometimes living dangerously brings out what playing it safe could never get you, and I think that's what happens here.  The adventure outweighs the lack of preparation, and the results are a truly unique listening experience.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"This is a nice, syncopating track featuring The Weeknd's (Abel Tesfaye) vocal stylings, both a nice falsetto during the chorus and an easy, smooth lower register during other lyrical segments.  The Weeknd is at his best when distilling the small pleasures in life (an unexpected phone call, a partnership of no lies) that form the foundation of love.  He hits a home run when listing the attributes of his object of love - one who is perfect, is worth it, deserves it, and ultimately has earned it.  Love is not freely given, it is earned; it takes time, investment, trust, but is ultimately the most significant thing we can share with another human being.  The Weeknd exalts in his love and the accompanying instrumentation and orchestration underscores the summit of feelings.  I recommend this brilliant track for your music library.\n\nRob.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"There is a bitter-sweet irony to the title of this lovely album, \"Grace\", given that only a year and a half previously, Kathleen Battle had decidedly and very publicly fallen from it, having been fired from the Met amidst rejoicing by her co-performers and the Met staff alike - although perhaps not the general public, who have long adored her, perhaps because it has not had to be on the receiving end of her whims and tantrums, only of the unearthly beauty of her pearlescent soprano lirico leggiero coloratura.\n\nInteresting that while she is revered in the USA, such that there are as I write twenty-five reviews on Amazon.com eulogising this CD there are none on Amazon UK. So I'll remedy that.\n\nIt was and is surely one of the most exquisite sounds ever to be produced in the human throat and it is allied to an acute musical intelligence and sensibility. This is a cunningly selected anthology of religious and liturgical music, mostly of the sunnier, more melodious variety but not cloying or sentimental. The fifty-strong band that supports her is uncredited but they produce a refined sound and are clearly made up of gifted New York City locals; they play with taste and restraint, not in period style but without Schmaltz or overt Romanticism. The oboe, harp and organ soloists are excellent and never overpower Battle's light sound. Her agility and breath-control are as impressive as ever; the top notes shine and the slight huskiness in the lower reaches of her voice enchants. She sings fluently in English, German, Latin, Italian and French and the booklet provides quadrilingual translations. The music spans the Baroque, through Classical to the High Romantic period, and embraces a wide range of musical idioms from the Lied to the Afro-American Spiritual, the latter \"Were You There?\" sung a capella with flawless intonation.\n\nThe only piece unfamiliar to me was the dreamily floating, chromatic \"Schlafendes Jesuskind\" by, unexpectedly, Hugo Wolf; it reminds me a little of Richard Strausss Christmas song Die heiligen drei Knige aus Morgenland but without the Angst. However, my favourite is the \"Echo Aria\" from Bach's \"Christmas Oratorio\", in which Battle's gently lilting vocal line is echoed by the oboe and a perfectly matched boy treble.\n\nThis might not be one of the largest voices ever to grace an opera stage but it is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful; fans of her sound need not hesitate.","classification":5,"fold":3}

In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.

I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was one of the Amazon freebies, previously mentioned.

{"text":"I'm a huge Styx fan, and also a longtime fan. My expectations were very high for 1990's 'Edge of the Century.' Styx had been gone since 1983, their last record being 'Kilroy Was Here.' I had set the standards really high, maybe too high.\n\nBut I was disappointed with this. Instead of the hard rock, pop rock and progressive rock that made Styx, well, Styx, this was just pop. It did have several moments; I do like 'Love Is The Ritual,' 'Show Me The Way' and 'Carrie Ann' a little bit.\n\nBut overall, this was disappointing. It's bubblegum pop, not at all rock. Tommy Shaw had left the band (I can understand why) and was replaced by top session musician Glen Burtnik.\n\nBut this isn't a terrible record, it's just not very good under Styx's standards. It is one of their more inspirational-themed albums.\n\nRecommended for the Styx die-hard or collector.","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"I think this is a really good album. I wasn't all that impressed on first hearing, but I have been playing it a lot and it has grown on me hugely. It is a pleasure to listen to and there is real musical quality here.\n\nPlant these days is much more in Raising Sand mode rather than full-on Zeppelin blazing. He is subtle and controlled (although there is still plenty of power there when needed) and I think this makes him a very fine singer indeed. He brings genuine depth to this material which is pleasingly varied, with elements of blues, Celtic music, rock, Bluegrass, gospel and various African styles all evident. It is quite rhythm-driven with percussion shaping almost every song, but it's varied and very well done so never becomes tedious or samey.\n\nThe Sensational Space Shifters are simply brilliant, playing their variety of instruments with real virtuosity. They complement and incorporate Plant's vocals beautifully, helped by impeccable production which to me makes this album shine with beauty, excitement and interest throughout. Rainbow and A Stolen Kiss, for example, are simply lovely in their own ways while Up On the Hollow Hill is modal, rhythmic and hypnotically involving. I don't think there's a duff track on the album and some are quite wonderful.\n\nThis is a work of depth and maturity with fine songs, musicianship and production which I think has the quality to last for many years. Warmly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"The latest effort by Alejandro Rose-Garcia, AKA Shakey Graves, is a solid example of a folk revival, produced by the estimable Dualtone Music Group, which also produces for rising greats such as The Lumineers, Noah Gunderson, and Shovels & Rope.  While not exactly a debut album, \"And The War Came\" is where we first see Shakey Graves confidently securing a place for himself in the genre among his Dualtone peers.\n\nFolk music's appeal to musicians is its deceptive simplicity -- the musicians must be able to do something amazing with the economy of means.  A look at successful artist in the genre is revealing;  Veterans Nickel Creek mastered this with minimal forces by displaying classical virtuosity.  The Lumineers achieved this by skillfully composed melodies.  Otherwise, it is easy for folk to fall into monotony with an acoustic instrumentation that doesn't develop, rote chord progressions that become repetitive, perhaps melodies that are stagnant and anemic.  What is great for this relative newcomer, Shakey Graves, is that the songwriting never falls into that minimalist trap.  He is only 25, yet his music is stylistically mature, surefooted, and instantly recognizable.  What is his magic ingredient?  After many listens, it seems to be his astute syncopations and prominent percussion, which lend to a dance-like atmosphere that persists, even in the quietest, most intimate tracks.\n\nThe melodies show a modern tinge here and there, but they still hold faithful to folk roots.  We begin with \"Only Son\", a largely quiet and intimate piece, which rewards the listener with the way the instrumentation develops.  He introduces the dance-like syncopation in layers, and the track culminates in a Lumineers-like chorus that brings to mind a folksy communal aspect to the music.\n\nOne standout track is \"Dearly Departed\", a duet featuring Esme Patterson.  This is perhaps the track that will appeal to the widest audiences.  Here, the percussion is the most prominent.  It is an example of good songwriting: all musicians are doing something meaningful and integral.  Percussion isn't merely an afterthought, not just a \"skeleton\" for the song.  The charming dialogue with Patterson is witty.  While it doesn't have the harmonic inventiveness of Hearst and Trent of Shovels & Rope, it is nonetheless a very effective track worth several replays.\n\n\"If Not For You\" is another standout, and is a personal favorite of the whole album.  The percussion syncopation sounds R&B inspired, but overall the song is a piece of modern folk.  This is a 'musician's' song: it begins by giving Rose-Garcia the opportunity to showcase his ability as an instrumentalist.  The solo is not at the end, but at the beginning -- an extended and impressive cadenza that has an introspective and improvisatory quality.  It is a striking solo for electric guitar that is reminiscent of mid-nineties Seattle grunge.  It is a masterful example of genre blending.\n\nThe more extroverted songs still have an intimate, personal touch.  \"Call It Heaven\", \"Pansy Waltz\", and \"Hard Wired\" fall into this category.  The rhythms are lithe, yet chord progressions and the vocal color make for a set of songs that are nonetheless inward and thoughtful, in contrast to the uptempo.\n\nOnce in a while, the listener can hear evidence of Rose-Garcia's time as part of the folk scene in Los Angeles.  Hear, for example, \"Family and Genus\" which blends Rose-Garcia's folksy melodies with an instrumentation that evokes California rock -- think Lumineers meets Young the Giant.\n\nIf you have not heard much from this artist, think of his vocal sound as a bit similar to Wesley Schultz of the Lumineers.  The gravely rasp is there, yet judiciously used.  He's a baritone counterpart to Schultz's tenor, yet capable of singing those high notes with confidence.\n\nThis record affords Shakey Graves the opportunity to go far because of its appealing songwriting.  Not once, however, does this record sound \"overproduced\".  It is still intimate, honest, rough-around-the-edges folk from Dualtone.  I'm eager to hear more from this artist and would recommend it to anyone.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I don't think I've given a Prince record one star in a long time, but this one was practically begging for it.\n\nPrince treads old ground here for at least the fourth or fifth time, delivering a searingly bad message-laden effort accompanied by forgettable music.  At three discs you want to hope that there is something salvageable here, but it's a mash of throw-away tracks that sound like tracks he used to give to other, failed bands.  The \"Lotus\" record is an airy mess, filled with lazy writing and retread energy.  The \"MPLSound\" record has all of the funk that was missing on the \"Lotus\" disc but still fails to do more than frustrate.  Even the welcome return of his sonic palette (hello pitched tom toms!) only elevates these tracks to music I still won't be listening to a week from now.  Finally, there is the included \"non-Prince\" record, singer Bria Valente's \"Elixer\" (misspelled for no apparent reason), which is thoroughly produced by Prince.  Valente is not without merit as a vocalist, and of the three records in this set this is the one that doesn't sound like a complete throwaway.  At the same time, it's hardly inspiring.  It's worth noting that this record - not the two proper Prince albums - contains the sole song worth having out of this whole set: the title track \"Elixer\", which is a powerful slow-grind of a duet with Prince.  That's it: one track worthy of his genius.\n\nI would challenge anyone to find a mere eight songs that would make one good album out of this material, but this 3-panel set doesn't have eight songs on it anyone will care about that isn't on the payroll.  If his vault is filled with 1000 songs of stuff that sounds like this, then someone should forget the combination.  A waste for anyone who isn't a completist or fanatic, who would even have to admit that at 25 albums deep, this one isn't even in the top 15.  If you bought this record AFTER having heard it, you're a very special person, a collector, or you're a person who just likes to collect Prince stuff whether it's good or not.","classification":1,"fold":3}

{"text":"I discovered Hollywood Undead with their recent Day of the Dead release (and fell in love with the music so much that I immediately went and bought their other main albums), so Im only just now going back and trying to collect their more obscure releases.  That brings me to this cd\/dvd combo, Desperate Measures.  When I checked this out, the first thing I noticed was the rather poor average review score.  I was baffled by the negative reviews for this product...and while I don't think they are merited, Im now starting to understand why they exist.  The band released this directly after Swan Songs when everyone was excited for a new albumand then they got this instead.  This release is really more of a bonus thing (the sort of thing that bands don't usually put out until they have a few main albums under their belt), so I can understand why some people were disappointed.  Nonetheless, Im going to judge it purely on its merits, which will be easier for me since Im not coming into it with the same expectations as someone several years ago.\n\nDisc 1 is a cd full of bonus songs: a mixture of original songs, covers, and some live tracks.  The first two original songs (Dove and Grenade, and Tear It Up) are great (and are among my favorite HU tracks), but El Urgencia is just okay, in my opinion.  The next couple songs are coversand they aren't exactly great (ugh, well, at least the HU boys seemed to be having some fun with it).  The last songs on the cd are live tracks, and they are pretty good; in fact, I rather enjoyed the live atmosphere of them.  It kinda makes me wish theyd release a full live album someday.  Oh, something odd to note (if you buy this on amazon) is that the mp3s being sold are actually the clean versionand there doesnt appear to be an explicit version of the mp3s being sold at all (as of the time of posting this review).  I have not been able to figure out why, but keep that in mind if you are like me and trying to get everything in its original, unaltered form.\n\nDisc 2 is actually a dvd.  It contains live concert footage, and a few little interviews\/extra bits (which are amusing) sprinkled throughout.  I was excited about having high quality concert recordings, but it feels like it was edited by someone with ADD.  The camera angle jumps around constantly, about every second, and it's a bit jarring to watch.  Still, its nice to have concert footage that wasn't filmed on someone's cell phone (and I eventually got used to the editing), so Im pleased to have this inclusion.  If nothing else, like the live tracks from Disc 1, this makes me yearn for a live album release.\n\nOverall, this cd\/dvd bundle is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of quality.  The original songs and live tracks are worth owning, but the covers are questionable.  The concert dvd is nice to have for the more hardcore fans, but I could understand why the casual fan might want to skip it.  I feel this item is worth owning, for me at least, since I'm happy to have some concert footage not filmed on a potato.  Also, as far as I know, this is the only official release containing live concert footage, and thus, it is now an important part of the historical record.  About 200 years from now when historians are studying Hollywood Undead, theyll be very grateful for this scrap of high-quality recordings.  If you are an HU fan and are considering picking this up, just keep in mind what it actually contains, and make an informed decision as to whether its worth it to you or not.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"The punk rock world was in a questionable state by the turn of the millennium.  One group that undoubtedly ruled the '90s scene -- Green Day, in October of 2000, would issue a nearly-all-acoustic record (\"Warning\"), which, while being okay, seemed to signal a change in direction, that could have been seen as a death-knell for the genre.  Were it not, that is, for a new crop of young bands, all of whom were just pre-teens in 1994 when Green Day released \"Dookie,\" that emerged around this time to save the day and inject some much-needed youthful vitriol to the sound.\n\nPerhaps the first group in this scene to break through to the mainstream during this era was Toronto, Ontario's Sum 41, who began recording their second release and the album being reviewed, \"All Killer, No Filler\", in October of Y2K, just as Green Day were clearly moving on to pastures anew.\n\nWow!  Talk about this record being a return to form for punk!  After a mood-setting intro, on track number two \"Nothing On My Back,\" the listener is introduced to the band's striking, distinctive, and razor-sharp guitar sound, which was equal parts traditional punk-rock reverb and equal parts pure attitude.  It is a guitar tone that is truly raw, inspired, and decidedly \"old school\" -- and was indeed copied ten times over by acts that would follow.  Often imitated, but never duplicated, because no one ever did it again like Sum did.\n\nAnd yet, on this same opener, it is made clear that the group also have the tunes to back it up, and then some!  From vocalist\/co-guitarist Deryck Whibley's ultra-memorable vocal lines and defiant sneer to bassist Cone's well-placed and twanging mid-song interlude, these guys prove they're the real deal, and it doesn't let up from there.  This cut segues into the 50-second \"Never Wake Up,\" which is a fast and furious monster and as good of a take on hardcore punk as any I've heard.  The two best songs, though, lie in the disc's second half.  One is \"Summer,\" a rerecording from the group's debut \"Half Hour of Power,\" and boy, is it a masterpiece!  The main driving force in it is a simple, three-chord progression, but it proves that sometimes the simplest riffing can also be the most effective.  And that chorus -- you will not get it out of your head for days!  No doubt, one of Sum's signature tunes.  Perhaps my all-time favorite, though, is track number ten, \"Crazy Amanda Bunkface.\"  This one is two minutes and 16 seconds of pure punk rock bliss, and Deryck's raging guitar solo, which is somewhat reminiscent of Green Day's earlier \"Haushinka,\" will surely have you cranking the sound to maximum levels and basking in the euphoria.  Again, a cut virtually unrivalled in the confines of punk.\n\nAnd there you have it -- 32 minutes of great music, with absolutely no boring spots anywhere to be found, that will surely have you putting \"All Killer, No Filler\" on repeat.  I know there was a time in the mid-2000s that I used to air this album in its entirety daily, and almost exactly 15 years on from its release, it hasn't dated one bit or lost its power to enthrall you.  I want to add that I'm 41 (incidentally) and have been listening to underground punk rock (Dead Kennedys, Government Issue, the F.U.'s, et al) for decades, and I still think that \"All Killer, No Filler\" is among the best-crafted punk LPs in my collection, with perhaps the highest replay value of them all.  A masterpiece that started a wave of imitators...  If you don't already own this one, well, what are you waiting for?!","classification":5,"fold":3}

Turns out that the tracks played at this gig are from the Igster's 'Lust For Life' ('77), 'The Idiot' ('77) and obviously his most recent work 'Post Pop Depression' ('16). Tunes I got the most out of were the previously mentioned ass-kicking \"Lust For Life\", \"Sister Midnight\", \"Funtime\", the awesome \"Nightclubbing\", the very recognizable \"The Passenger\" and \"China Girl\". Not to mention some material off the newest CD - like \"Gardeia\", \"Chocolate Drops\" and \"Paraguay\". Only downside here - maybe for some - is that I didn't see any Stooges classics covered.

One thing you notice is that the group vocals \/ vocal arrangements are not as interesting.  Also, the vague lyrics aren't really helping interest in the songs either.  There is a sense of epicness missing from the songs on this album that were present on many of the songs on the prior releases.  I wonder if doing most of the recording in Hollywood influenced the production?  You'd probably describe this album simply as somewhat of a sophomore slump, although it's actually the 3rd release.

{"text":"I was hesitant to buy this album because I hadn't heard too many good things about it. For one, the Amazon.com review said, \"Why pick on a girl for taking a chance?\" Why would anyone pick on her? This is a great album that takes her Jewelness to a new level. Her lyrics, while mostly pertaining to love, are still hers in the sense that she puts poetic thought into them. She also has some great message-bearing songs, and then just some fun ones with no need for substance!\n\"Stand\" is the first song and is a great way to kick off the album. It talks about the sadness of the world we live in, how some poor people spend money on drugs and alcohol, there's a lot of violence, and other horrible things. She also mentions how we can come together and make a change!\nI really liked \"2 Find U\" because it talked about the problems of relationships. Though there are mistakes that we make with our boyfriend or girlfriend, we have two choices when fights or things like that happen: 1) we can let the pain win and walk away forever, or 2) we can give eachother a clean slate & start over. Jewel asks for a clean slate in this song, it's very bittersweet.\nHer voice is so cutesy in \"Fragile Heart,\" it's funny! She uses simple sentences and the childlike sound of her voice makes it amusing to me: \"If you want my heart, you have to promise not to tear it apart, 'cause my heart has been hurt a lot.\" It's a cautionary song letting someone know she's had lots of pain in the past and doesn't want that now.\nI must say that \"Haunted\" gave me goosebumps when I first heard it, and still does!!! Though Jewel's liner notes say it's about a stalker (which makes sense if you look at the lyrics), I like to think it's a very dark song about someone who Jewel wants revenge against. She describes how she will \"come to you in the still of the night\" and \"crush you with the burden of sight.\" The music is very creepy and slick, adding to the frightful feel of the song. There's also a little clock ticking in the background, making it all the more paranoid and intense! Remind me not to make her mad! :-)\n\"Yes U Can\" is a song that really doesn't have much meat to it lyrically, but is very fun to listen to! It describes a club scene with cowboys and 'naughty girls.' It's tongue-in-cheek I think, kind of playing on words and stuff. Very good song!\nI think \"America\" might be my favorite song on this album. It talks about the imperfections of our country, from the fact that our president wants us to 'shed blood in the name of liberty' to the deteriorating quality of TV shows. She doesn't just blast America, though, she admits that although she wants to change it she wouldn't leave it if she could.\nYes, Jewel's sound is altered here on this electronic album. But don't think it's crap because of that; like I said, in my opinion it enhances her greatness. Though there are some very computerized songs, there are also ones that are closer to her acoustic style on \"This Way.\" I would strongly encourage every Jewel fan to give this album an honest listen! I think it'll be worth it!","classification":5,"fold":3}
{"text":"Another Bach Guild Big Box Set winner!  As has been noted by other reviewers, you won't find much Debussy or Ravel here and chamber music is also absent but otherwise you have a wide ranging survey in generally good to excellent sound.  A couple performances have appeared in other Big Boxes - Elman's Lalo and the Gilels Saint-Saens Piano Concerto #2 (which, BTW, is the only recording that seriously sounds its age, probably late 1940s or early 1950s.\n\nSome of the highlights - Berlioz does very well, with a collection of overtures conducted by Alexander Gibson and a Symphonie Fantastique under Charles Mackerras that is notable for including the repeats in the 1st and 4th movements and the cornet parts in the 2nd movement.  The tympani are also impressively recorded!  Saint-Saens also is well represented, with a bang-up Organ Symphony performed by Sergiu Commisionna and the Baltimore Symphony (why did the last movement get me to thinking of a BLT?), a delightful Carnival of the Animals and the 2nd Piano Concerto.  Philippe Entremont and the Denver Symphony contribute a collection of French chestnuts, including the Sorcerer's Apprentice and Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun.  Bizet is represented by the Symphony in C, Jeux d'enfants, the Suites from L'Arlesienne and a few orchestral minutes from Carmen. The Lalo selections are also quite enjoyable and I really like Ronan O'Hara's Satie (BTW his contributions to the Big Schumann Box were among the highlights of that collection.\n\nI can't see myself returning to the early music too often but there's more than enough here to keep me occupied.","classification":5,"fold":3}

This album is so wonderful, Cher's voice soars like nothing else she has done before.  Check out the amazing \"When The Money's Gone\", it is so perfect that you'll have to listen to it over and over again until your are dead tired.  Clear the dance floor!  \"Different Kind Of Song\" blasts through your speaker with super sonic vocoder energy.  The hook is unreal, and \"Alive Again\" is a spiritual moment unlike anyother.  The US includes the tracks \"When You Walk Away\" and let me tell you-so good.  Much more upbeat then \"You Take It All\"(on the international pressing), and fits itself nicely into the overall atmosphere of the album.  I believe that this is Cher's most thought provoking and fully put together album.  There is a heavy spiritual vibe that runs through the ablum, take \"Love One Another\" for example.  And obviously the afore mentioned \"Song For The Lonely\" is included.  \"The Music's No Good Without You\" is one of my favorite Cher songs ever.  Talk about fabulous.  It is by no means a typical Cher song but proves that she is forever invincible.  After months of waiting \"Living Proof\" is finally here, Cher is back.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"OMG, a complete Ring cycle IN STEREO for only 8 bucks! (Well, 9 bucks actually but more on that later.)\n\nNot the greatest cycle on record, perhaps, but pretty decent overall, pretty good sound (for the most part), plenty of lovely singing and playing from the orchestra, moving were it should be moving and thrilling where it should be thrilling - what more can one ask?\n\nSome people pooh pooh this set but it's perfectly fine, especially if money is tight. I couldn't be more pleased, myself.\n\nAs is pointed out, there are a couple of technical issues (see post above): 3 tracks out of order (pretty easy to fix) and 1 track is missing (there's a track there but it's a duplicate of the 2nd track before it)\n\nThe missing track is disc 4, track 3 \"Lass ich's verlauten\" - it is actually a duplicate of disc 4, track 1 \"Was verlagst du\"\n\nTo fix, do a search (in the Amazon search bar) for: die walkure lass ich's verlauten\n\nThe correct Lass ich's is the 7m 44s one (should be 1 and 2 on list, either will do) - the bad one is 7th on list, 5m 49s (that's the one in the complete download). Buy it for another 99cents and replace the bad one with it (make sure you edit the track info in Properties).\n\nYou'll probably want to edit the track info on the whole set anyway; the CD set had ten discs and the mp3 tracks from each CD have the disc number appended at the beginning, ex: (Disc 2) 01 ...... (Disc 2) 02 .... etc. All EXCEPT for the first CD, which only has the track #s (01, 02, 03, etc) and so this disc appears at the bottom of the folder instead of the top. Kind of a pain in the rear, I know, and for good measure, since there are 10 discs, I had to add a leading 0 the single digit discs, so (Disc 01), (Disc 02), etc - you get the picture. Don't know if that was really neccesary but I did it anyway.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Taylor Swift is cute. I mean, that's my opinion of her and the opinion of many others. Very few see her as a true artist who has diversity in songs--she does the same lyrics and the same style every time. There isn't much to call art, to be honest.\n\nThat was until this album was released.\n\nGranted, WANEGBT wasn't artistic in any regard (still pondering that Grammy nod...more likely a \"thank you for hosting the nominations concert\" treat), but that was not indicative of what was to come on the rest of the record. If you are a dire-hard country fan, you will be disappointed by this album. Then again...why are you listening to a Taylor Swift album in the first place? Her last two albums were more pop than country, so I don't really see a worthy criticism in that regard.\n\nThe album opens and doesn't reach a weak point until...well, track 10. State of Grace is a U2 throwback that can only be described as epic. Red is the song everyone (male and female alike) will blare with their windows down on the highway. The gradual crescendo on Treacherous is absolutely wonderful, leading into I Knew You Were Trouble. I never thought that I would see the day when DUBSTEP was in a Taylor Swift song and it worked...but I guess I did. This is one of the best songs released this year and will be a bona fide smash hit on the Hot 100, no doubt.\n\nI just realized how long this album was and how great it was and how repetitive I would be if I went through each and every song and said how wonderful it was, so I will say which tracks were bad.\n\nThe Last Time - Meh. nothing appealing about this. Slow and groggy would be two choice words to describe it.\n\nStarlight - VOMIT. Horrible. Sounds like a throwaway Selena Gomez track.\n\nThat's it, honestly...The Ed Sheeran Collab was PERFECT, and BEGIN AGAIN WILL MAKE ANY GIRL CRY. Just saying.\n\nA solid fourth album. She has made me a fan.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Trivium's third studio album The Crusade may have divided fan opinion when it was released due to the band moving away from metal core influences and relying more heavily on their thrash metal influences.\nWithout the screaming vocals, and with much more frequent dual guitar leads the album was different from what fans had been expecting. These days however, The Crusade fits perfectly into the Trivium catalogue thanks to their newer music combining the two styles, and thanks to the passage of time, along with the mixture of this material with the older stuff at Trivium concerts revealing to many quick-to-dismissal fans that the changes which the band had made for The Crusade weren't actually as extreme as people thought at the time.\nThe Crusade features many great songs, many of which the band still keep in their live set to this day, from `Entrance of the Conflagration,' and `Unrepentant,' to the omni-present single `Anthem (We Are The Fire)'\nThe musicianship is of a very high quality, copious guitar solos, thrash tinged riffs and interesting drum fills make for an interesting listen, while the production is of the highest standard, making the album sound fantastic.\nHighlights include the ferocious `Becoming The Dragon,' the slow and brooding `And Sadness Will Sear,' and the eight minute instrumental title tack.\nTo Summarise, don't be put off by talk of this album not being heavy enough or any talk of selling out, The Crusade is a well written, enjoyable record that is unquestionably worth a chance.","classification":4,"fold":3}
{"text":"I ordered this without hesitation when I was notified that it was coming out.  It is a very progressive endeavor to capture alot of those stray Sly songs into one location.  It was also a good move to add all the hits in 'mono' not that we needed that, but it will lure the 'Sly curious' listener to this set.\n\nSly, producer for Autumn Records, an independent San Francisco record co (Beau Brummels) tried his hand at recording a few sides which never charted, but revealed that there was something different about this guy.  When he formed the Family Stone, that's when things stared to heat up.  A deal with Columbia produced a relatively quiet Debut, with a promising title \"A Whole New Thing\".  That wouldn't happen until their sophomore effort, \"Dance to the Music\".  The rest needs no repeating.\n\nThis set offers 17 previously unreleased songs and perhaps 23 when you consider the Amazon bonus disc.  The idea that there are STILL more in the vault is fascinating.  And Sly's brother Freddy said that Sly is 'still making good music' in his own exile.\n\nSly always said that he wanted to explore other non conventional ideas in music.  His idea to release Que Sera Sera' in a slow groove on Fresh was innovative.  And the live 'St James Infirmary' makes you wish that he had lead the Family into recording a jazz tinged album, like what happened with James Brown.\n\nThe only complaint that I have is that when the set was offered as a download, it was less inexpensive than buying the physical box set, by 30 dollars.  But it is well worth it.","classification":5,"fold":3}

This stuff is pass, but as I was saying, once you dip your feet into the soundscapes of Aphex Twin type electronic ambient and effects type stuff, you might just go there all the way and get rid of the singing. And you'll end up at Boards of Canada and that type of stuff, even The Orb, and then onto John Hopkins. I'm surprised people aren't tired of Yorke's whining.

Nonetheless, this coffee shop favorite is not set to whither away, with both her parent's fan base and her brother's loyal followers to aid her.\n\nThe code, here, is not hard to crack, however, it takes time for Wainwright's vocal stretching and folkie approach to latch on, much like her bother's latest Want Two.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"The pointblank outpouring of the feminine soul - in a state of anguish & mourning - receives its full measure in this exceptional classic \"Un-break My Heart\"; sung with truly unique voice inflections & intonations by Toni Braxton; composed & written by Diane Eve Warren. We hear our heroine pleading for and commanding her deceased or departed lover to return to her immediately to assauge her loss and hurt, \"Don't leave me in all this pain, Don't leave me out in the rain...\" The use of the imperative is so forceful and direct, it heightens the emotional impact of the song, and renders us as wrung out with emotional catharsis - as she is.\n\nBraxton's soft, silky utterances easily immerse the listener in the strength and power of her heavier vocal chords - when she pours it on, \"Say you'll love me again, Undo this hurt you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life; Un-cry these tears, I cried so many nights...Un-break my heart!\" The excellent video for this song with its dramatic intensity lifts this rendition into being scene- and plot-driven, like \"Mourning Becomes Electra\" with the lights turned down.\n\nThis in turn builds plot and 'grief' motif within 'surround sound' orchestration. Braxton's intensity, her passionate request for her lover to return - becomes one of the more powerful crescendos in pop music. This would not be so - if her lips were sealed - they had to be un-sealed - her depth of expression from deep within her soul - may cause us to grieve (our catharsis, her purge of emotion). We listen to her final refrain and empathize with her loss. It is quite satisfying if not exhausting. We hope to be drenched in her emotional denouement upon re-playing this cinematic song. It is yours to enjoy when the mood is right.\n\n\"Bring back the nights when I held you beside me\nUn-break my heart\nSay you'll love me again\nUndo this hurt you caused\nWhen you walked out the door\nAnd walked out of my life\nUn-cry this tears\nI cried so many, many nights\nUn-break my\nUn-break my heart oh baby\nCome back and say you love me\nUn-break my heart\nSweet darlin'\nWithout you I just can't go on\nCan't go on....\"","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Hip-Hop has expanded over the years, and is now so broad that any argument about who is best, or what is best is by large an opinion based on personal taste. Hip-Hop fans often describe real Hip-Hop, which is largely a description for vintage New York street-rap grounded within the foundation of beats and rhymes.\n\nThe modern day producer is an extension of the old school DJ  an individual capable of keeping the beat as an MC delivered rhymes. Over the years, there have been numerous artists  MCs combined with producers  from various regions successfully adhering to this blueprint.\n\nIn recent years, however, Hip-Hop has suffered from artists who care less of stylistic and progressive artistry as they do mindless garbage feeding upon a generation less interested with intelligence as they do self-suppression. Fortunately, some venerable rappers remain in the game, and Cormega is one of the very best. When teamed with super producer Large Professor, the result is brilliant music. Mega Philosophy is vintage New York Hip-Hop in the pure form of beats and rhymes.\n\nCormega has never compromised his rhyme-style. In 2014, he sounds the same way he did vocally, way back in the 90s when he first emerged commercially. There are no fake southern accents, gimmick vocal patterns, or dumbed-down content. This is an album to relax to  to think about life; to think about where you come from; to think about where you're going. That being said, its not a heavy project, which makes it so brilliant. As we say in New York, Mega is dropping jewels. And not only does he drop jewels, but he does so over the brilliant production of a true beatmaster.

Well, I say that I still enjoy their music a whole lot. A majority of their albums are living proof that they can create powerful and haunting music. Ride The Lightning, the second album and the first without former member Dave Mustaine, is an all-around masterpiece. From beginning to end, it's pure brilliance. Songs like \"Fade to Black\" and \"Creeping Death\" are sure to please every Metallica fan out there. \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" is not only my personal favorite on the album, but also my personal favorite from the band themselves. It's five minutes of pure awesomeness. \"The Call of Ktulu\" is a 9-minute instrumental that may be boring to some, but I find the melodies and sounds to be completely engaging. In short, I won't describe what the songs mean or sound like, since I'm sure almost every reviewer on this page are Metallica fans. I'll just conclude by saying that Ride The Lightning is a great metal album.\n\nGrade: 9.8\/10","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"\"LotusFlow3r\" is easily Prince's best album since 1997's \"The Truth\" (aka Disc 4 of \"Crystal Ball\"), and possibly since 1995's \"The Gold Experience.\" It has a great overall flow and sounds like a complete album, unlike hodgepodges such as \"Planet Earth,\" \"3121,\" and \"Musicology.\"  The focus is on cohesive pop and rock songs, without the conceptual mumbo-jumbo that ruined the otherwise musically inventive \"Rainbow Children.\"\n\nEach track on \"LotusFlow3r\" is worthwhile, especially the brilliant \"4ever\" - one of Prince's best pure pop songs in many a year.  The album drips with intense guitar soloing, which saves even the somewhat uninspired Hendrix rip \"Dreamer\" (a little too close to \"Voodoo Child\").  Some of the album is instrumental, including the bookends \"From the Lotus...\" and \"...Back 2 the Lotus\" which open and close the album, but they are musically strong.  \"77 Beverly Park\" is an acoustic guitar based instrumental that is among the loveliest trifles Prince has released in some time.  \"Love Like Jazz\" is funny (intentionally, I believe), and \"Wall Of Berlin\" builds up serious momentum.\n\nThere really isn't much downside to \"LotusFlow3r,\" except when comparing it to Prince's true masterworks.  With especially strong vocals, a live rhythm section throughout, and (for the first time in too long) plenty of hooks, the album sits comfortably alongside other second-tier Prince discs.  It ain't \"Parade\" or \"Lovesexy,\" but the man is never likely to scale those heights ever again.  However, it's a kick to hear him so focused and inspired.\n\nThen there's \"MPLSound,\" the second of two all-new Prince albums.  While the album is nearly as focused as \"Lotus,\" it's unfortunately focused on the stale, electro-beat dance crud that Prince has glutted his discography with for the past ten years.  The opening three songs are overlong, largely melody-free, and worst of all BORING.  Mid-album, things pick up a bit, with the ballad \"U're Gonna C Me\" (which was previously released in a far superior alternate version on \"One Night Alone\") and a satisfying mid-tempo pop tune \"Here.\"  \"MPLSound\" peaks with the stunning ballad \"Better With Time,\" though even that song is somewhat marred by a too-loud drumtrack.  \"Valentina\" is an embarrassment, a lust letter to Salma Hayek addressed to her toddler daughter (\"Hey Valentina, tell yo' mama she should give me a call\").\n\nAs for Bria Valente's Prince-produced debut, \"Elixer,\" I was pleasantly surprised.  Even though Ms. Valente's voice is thin and unremarkable, Prince has written and produced a solid album in the 'smooth jazz' vein that is actually more listenable than \"MPLSound.\"  The title track, a tantalizing duet between Prince and Valente, is the sexiest creation by Prince in years.  \"Kept Woman,\" \"Something U Already Know,\" and \"Immersion\" are all highlights.  I expected \"Elixer\" to be a total throwaway, yet it turned out to be a the second best of the three discs.\n\nBottom line: \"LotusFlow3r,\" while not a true return-to-form, is a kickin' guitar rock work-out with Prince's best tunes in eons.  I consider the other two discs to be more like \"bonus\" material, especially since the package is so economically priced.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention \"No More Candy 4 U\" - this killer throwback to the \"Controversy\"-era is classic Prince.","classification":3,"fold":3}

Fellow Texan Willie Nelson is featured on a couple of duets.\nI always think that this type of album must be the hardest to record - it would be very easy to end up with something mediocre, but Ray and the boys have shown, once again, that it's possible to record an album of high quality which is also FUN.","classification":5,"fold":3}

The whole thing is solid and consistent, with Washington's soulful, passionate vocals, and polished, stylish production. Other great ballads from the album include \"Lovers After All\" and \"When It Comes To You\" and the mid-tempo, new-jack styled \"Ready, Willing And Able\" is also great. He had a few hits up through 1998, but this is Keith Washington at his stylish best.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I have this album in Vinyl and CD format. Let me say the Vinyl just blows the CD outta the water. I just got this LP at a local record store but it is the 180 grahm (audiophile quality) edition. If you are gonna get anything in Vinyl make sure it is in good condition or 180 grahm audiophile quality editions or Half Speed Mastered. If you don't know what half mastered is well here is a break down. What is done is the album is transfered to vinyl at half the speed of a normal 33 rpm record, thus giving you profoundly better quality over your run of the mill LP.\n\nAnyways onto my real review of this record. The guitars and symbols sound very crisp here. Everything just sounds crisp and more natural. Vinyl is just the way to go with all of your favorite music. Most people would be surprised at how much modern music is put on vinyl these days. I give this album a 5\/5. It has not one filler song and is mixed really well.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"This is Carly Simon at her finest.  A song that not only features her strong, wonderful voice but also a powerful message about survival that still resonates with people even today.  Released in 1974, it features not only Carly Simon on vocals but also James Taylor on acoustic guitar.  The song deals with how, after a good person enters someone's life, everything changes for the better.\n\nPerhaps though what makes this song so powerful is its message of hope and survival after suffering.  While some may see this as a kind of self-absorption, the song really could apply to so much more--long-term abuse, mental illness, loneliness, or chronic physical illness being some examples.\n\nIt may have been made in the 1970's but the message is really timeless.

{"text":"When this song was released in 2015 I was immediately drawn to it. The songs mix of gospel and Elvis-soul,\nwith horns, is a pure delight and a genre bending blend. It is so different from what we hear on the radio today\nit harkens me back to the great FM radio experiment of the late 60s and early 70s where anything went in the\ngenre field of dreams.\n\nThis song has great energy from the beginning. The musicianship and writing marks this piece as an A1 effort\nwith a huge sustainable listening quotient. Every time I heard it on a, commercial, locally owned FM radio\nstation, I'd smiled and hum along with the chorus. Music should move you and this one does every time I hear\nit.\n\nUsing gospel stylings as the band hum, stomp and clap is pure Simple and a great contrast with the Elvis-like\nbig production for the abrupt chorus, son of a bitch\". The difference in the two genres accentuates the struggle\nthe man is having with the demon liquid and is a moving contrast that propels the song and provides dramatic\ntension. In short, great stuff by playing one genre off the other; the sinner and the angel fighting for the soul.\n\nAccording to an interview with Mr. Rateliff this was a real alcohol detox situation for the writer, who decided to\nput it into a song. Well, what is it they say about writing? Write about what you know; and he did. Its about how\nhe did it, how he put it all together and ended up with a powerhouse song.\n\nThis song receives 5 red hot stars and I hope that this band will expand and create more music for my ears.\nBravura and keep on truckin folks. It doesn't get much better than this...","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"\"On My Mind, In My Heart\" is an upbeat blues love song with a 1940's flavor.  The very strong vocals of Jesse Dee are supported by great back up musicians.  This includes a notable tenor sax player who wails out a great solo leading into the last verse.  The message is very sweet, too.  Even though the couple is physically apart, they are together in their minds and their hearts.\n\nI picked up this song during a rising artist free promotion.  This is one of the best songs I've downloaded under this promotion this year.","classification":5,"fold":3}
{"text":"First listen to Jack Johnson's new CD \"To the sea\" and you'd be forgiven for thinking it's more of the same. Johnson's music invokes images of guitar playing on the beach by a campfire and this is no different.\n\n\"You and your heart\" opens the album in jaunty form and is catchy, it became his first US top 20 hit a few weeks back. \"To the sea\" is a lulling ditty with quivery guitars and an edgy guitar solo.\n\nThe Blues-tinged \"At or with me\" has a nice start-stop effect with the instrumentation. The brief \"When I look up\" reminds one of The Beach Boys, while \"From the clouds\" has a light Reggae lilt. \"My little girl\" is a tender acoustic ballad with lyrics that sound like a father's wise words to his child.\n\n\"Turn your love\" is calming with wonderful harmonies, while \"The upsetter\" features slightly complex rhythms. The cleverly titled \"Pictures of people taking pictures\" is an absolute gem, as is the quivering \"Only the ocean\".\n\nSo yes, it is more of the same at first listen, but with just the right tweaks and nuances making it one of his most upbeat and diverse collections yet.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Technically a sophomore recording (this group has previously released an EP under the band name The Jakes) these young musicians have released a self-titled album that sounds mature, original, and sure-footed.  It is clearly the product of a band that will be filling concert venues and playlists for years to come.\n\nSameer Gadhia is a vocal force to be reckoned with.  He is a dark-timbred baritenor with a wide and effortless range.  He has an uncanny ability to blend energetic rock and legato jazz-esque vocals.  His is one of those voices that helps Young The Giant achieve a distinct sound.  He ranks as a personal favorite among modern male vocalists, together with the likes of Nate Ruess of the band Fun.\n\nWith regard to the songwriting, it is expert.  I write with particular attention to the Special Edition, including the new songs \"Every Little Thing\" and \"Typhoon.\"  I stand by the statement that \"Typhoon\" is probably the best song Young The Giant has written.  It is essentially a duet with Ghadia as lead and Comtois in the bridge and choruses.  Harmonies like this are hard to find these days.  The feel of the song is similar to \"God Made Man\" in that it begins slowly and softly and develops naturally into something bigger: soft guitars and a quiet piano solo eventually give way to an electric bass and crashing drums, but all while maintaining its lyricism.  With a non-standard tuning for the guitars, the interesting key progressions in the verses, and use of triple time, this all makes \"Typhoon\" a rather unique listening experience.\n\nThe album takes a breather from the high-intensity tracks with \"God Made Man\" as the albums mid-point.  The development of this through-composed song is astonishing coming from such a young group of musicians.  It starts as a tranquil, easy-going piece, and develops into a forceful, extended coda, with a lyrical bass supporting rock-inspired vocals: \"I want you to know...\"\n\nThe standout track (besides Cough Syrup) is \"I Got.\"  The catchy triple meter, precision percussion played by Francois Comtois, and a pair of guitars seemingly in dialogue with each other, together with vocal harmonies in the chorus, evince high quality musicianship from all of the members.  It is natural sounding and free-flowing.\n\n\"Cough Syrup\" is one of their first songs.  It was previously released when the band was called The Jakes on an EP called \"Shake My Hand.\"  Among the additions to the present version was a solo cello in the introduction and cleaner harmonies in the instruments.  \"Garands at Normandie\" is also a reissue from their days as The Jakes, adding a brand new intro and coda (it originally had an intro for acoustic guitar).  The result is a more mature and confident sound.\n\nThe follow up album \"Mind Over Matter\" is equally recommended, espousing a more hardened, rock-inspired sound.  They both come highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":3}

That said, I didn't think I would like this album, but I do!\n\nI first purchased the song \"Walk the Line\" as a download, and liked it a lot, so I decided to sample the other songs.  \"F. Love\" was the next one I downloaded.  It was so funny and has a great beat.  Eventually I bought the entire album and like just about every song.  The only one I don't care for much is \"100\".  But even that one is on my ipod until I decide to delete it.\n\nI really like Iggy's style of rap, how she uses electronic music and pop melodies, and her voice is unique.  It isn't a typical rap album (good for me, maybe not for others).  I guess it is a pop-rap album?  Her lyrics are entertaining and sometimes humorous.  I'm not sure if she is being totally serious or it's intended to be funny at times.  But the songs are interesting, fun, catchy, and entertaining.  My favorites are Walk the Line, F. Love, Fancy, Lady Patra, Goddess, and Bounce.","classification":4,"fold":3}

In fact in my humble opinion it's one of his best since People Are Crazy was released.\n\nAnyone, young or old that can listen to this song and not feel the need to get up and dance, or car dance or chair dance just needs to have someone shovel dirt on them because they're close to dead.  The story line is good and takes me back to when my life was a whole lot simpler with fewer worries.  I venture to say that there's probably very few people who haven't sung along to a song such as this and didn't imagine themselves being \"rock stars\"!  It speaks of young love, partying and dancing by moonlight on the river bank, turning the music up loud and just hangin' with your friends.  For that night, at that moment in time, you can forget everything and be whoever you want to be for that night.

{"text":"With the way music has gone from good to embarrassingly bad lately, I guess I shouldn't be surprised that even Deftones has lost its edge. This is not a bad album, but it's not great either. Does anybody remember Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure? If you do, you probably remember Wyld Stallions, and how the music of Bill and Ted restored peace and reset Nature's balance around the globe. Well, it feels like that's what Deftones are ATTEMPTING to do with Gore. It's a collection of eleven tracks that are neither metal nor rock nor ambient. They're eleven average songs trying too hard to restore peace and reset Nature's balance around the globe. None of these tracks stand out. They all just kind of start and end and blend from one to the next. This is one of my favorite bands, but this is definitely my least favorite album they've released since their inception well over a decade ago. To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement.

{"text":"An Evening With The Allman Brothers Band 2nd Set (1995) was recorded in 1994 at shows in Raleigh, NC and New Jersey's Garden State Arts Center. This was during the Back Where It All Begins period, and there are four songs from that album included here.\n\nThe opening song, Sailin' Cross The Devil's Sea sounds great, a lot like the studio version, and features Gregg Allman's legendary blues growl. Gregg and Warren Haynes both shine on this inspired version of Warren's Soulshine. Dickey Betts' Latin-flavored and breezy Back Where It All Begins features a long guitar jam, where he and Warren trade interesting and enthusiastic solos. They also do a great job on No One To Run With.\n\nThey dip into the At Fillmore East catalog with a very good version of You Don't Love Me, and while not as ambitious as the 20+ minute Fillmore East version, it is very good, and Dickey even flashes back to the earlier version by quoting his guitar solo from it. It's really an amusing and touching moment, and it sounds good, too. They also do a nice cover of another old blues song, The Same Thing.\n\nThis recording of Jessica won the Allmans their first and only Grammy Award, and what a wonderful version of Jessica this is! With dual guitar harmonies and more bongo drums and percussion than the studio version, the song sounds almost completely different from the original, and stretches out over sixteen minutes.\n\nEven with all this, the real highlight on the album is the breathtaking unplugged version of In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed. WOW!!!!!!!!!!!! The newbies who think Dickey Betts is no more than a mediocre guitarist should listen to this, and then reconsider. Warren Haynes stays right up there with him. The two guitarist show what they can really do on acoustic guitars, and bassist Allen Woody shines, too. This is priceless, a real gem that no ABB fan would want to miss.\n\nLike the First Set, the 2nd Set was produced by music legend (and At Fillmore East producer), Tom Dowd, and the sound is exquisitely crisp and crystal clear. The clever packaging on both sets is almost identical, with the same cover photo, except the First Set is blue, the 2nd Set is red, and the photos inside and liner notes are different (the layout is the same).\n\nThis was a good place in time for The Allman Brothers Band and their fans, and it really shows on An Evening With The Allman Brothers Band, First Set and 2nd Set. Don't miss out on em'!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I love everything Sevendust has ever done, and I loved the significant evolution that was heard on each of their first 3 albums. Since then, they've continued to put out quality metal, but it seems that they got stuck a few times in terms of direction. \"Seasons\" was an excellent album, but it didn't do much that \"Animosity\" hadn't already done. \"Alpha\" was also great (one of their heaviest), but it didn't do much that \"Next\" hadn't done. I prefer Sevendust when they're heavy, but I felt like \"Next\" and \"Alpha\" were slightly boring compared to earlier stuff...the songs weren't as diverse, and the chugging guitar riffs and the chorus vocals seemed a bit repetitive. Now we have \"Hope and Sorrow,\" the band's 7th album. It's a breath of fresh air, because we see the band getting back to incorporating melody again. \"Inside\" is a great opening tune because it's very heavy and also it sounds like the Sevendust we know and love. \"Enough\" offers a fun guitar riff that breaks the cycle of the chugging guitar riffs from the last 2 albums. The first single, \"Prodigal Son\" is a very basic tune, but it's catchy groove will get stuck in your head almost immediately. \"The Past\" is a mellow tune featuring Chris Daughtry doing some guest singing, and while it isn't a very strong track, it's nice to see the band playing with this style again.\nOverall, this is a typical sounding Sevendust record, and it represents their general sound quite nicely. It's certainly not the strongest album they've put out, but I'm glad they are back to experimenting with different styles again. I think if they had put out another album that sounded like \"Next\" or \"Alpha\" it wouldn't be enough to hold my attention with all the other albums coming out this year.

{"text":"Yes, this was the Bee Gees 'white' album, only this doubled LP had a red velvet cover and a 'Titanic'-like illustration in the gatefold.  Now available on a single CD, it marks the end of the sixties period for the Bee Gees.\nThe music?  This was an important time for the Gibbs' who were maturing (at ages 19 and 21) and already millionaires.  The music was conceptual and starting with the title track, it delivers with powerful orchestration and emotional, lyrical simplicity.  It is a skewed look at a fabled seafarer lost at sea and emotionally destitute.  At least, that's what the project started out to be.\nSomewhere during the recordings, egos flared and tempers snapped, so what you ended up with is a collection of half Bee Gees conceptual songs and half individual Gibb contributions.  It is still a remarkable recording!\nStand-out cuts are \"Marley Purt Drive\" that could have been recorded by \"The Band\" and \"Melody Fair\", a single in some countries and a well covered track.\nMost of the other tracks deal with period issues like, drugs, sex, rock 'n roll, psychodelia and why not?  Producer Stigwood unwittingly fueled the tensions by choosing \"First Of May\" as the A-Side single instead of B-Side \"Lamplight\", which was just as strong.\nRegardless, the final outcome is a conceptual album filled with an orchestrally sweeping moodiness aligned with perfect harmonies and lyrics envied by everyone. This is one of the few albums of the period with orchestral solos with the Gibbs providing the chorus.  It is monumental.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"For anyone wanting to hear the debut of \"I Will Always Love You\" look no further than here. Recorded in June, 1973 at RCA Record's Nashville Sound Studios and released the following year Dolly Parton introduced the world to the greatest song ever written. She had written the tune in honor of her duet partner and mentor Porter Wagoner.\n\n By 1973 after being the biggest duet team in country music history for 6 years Dolly wanted to go off on her own, conquer the pop music market and star in films. Porter was totally against this as he thought Dolly could never make it in popular music or in motion pictures and he felt Dolly owed him a great deal of gratitude for helping her be so big in the country field. The fighting got worse and the arguing ever worser as Porter refused to reason with Dolly, so Dolly thought to herself, \"You can't talk to this man, so do what you so best: go home and write a song and perhaps he will somehow understand what I need to do\". So, one night in the late spring of 1973 with only her guitar in her music room at her Nashville mansion Dolly wrote \"I Will Always Love You\" in less than an hour. The following day she went to Porter's office, and knowing she was going to go one way or another, told Porter, \"I wrote a song for you\". He sat at his desk and cried all the way through it and told her that was the greatest song she ever wrote.\n\n When Dolly went into the recording studio to cut \"I Will Always Love You\" a few weeks later she herself cried through the entire song. To this very day it remains one of her greatest recordings.\n\n \"I Will Always Love You\" came out on Dolly's breathough album \"Jolene\" as the second single, hit #1 and quickly became Dolly's signature song. The following year Linda Ronstadt covered the track on her \"Prisoner in Disguise\" album, although it omitted the last verse.\n\n Also in 1975 \"I Will Always Love You\" (Dolly's original version) made its first ever appearance on film in Martin Scorsese's \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\" when the character of Alice takes a break from singing in the bar she works at and is having a talk with her soon-to-be boyfriend. Unfortunately, Dolly nor the song did not receive screen credit.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I first heard the compelling nasally slow draw (in the good sense) voice of Lucinda Williams on tribute albums. First, on the Hank Williams tribute album, \"Timeless\", where she did a cover of his classic tale of love's trials and tribulations \"Cold, Cold Heart\". I mentioned in a review of that CD that very seldom did anyone cover a Hank Williams song better than he did himself. I noted the exception of Lucinda on that rendition of \"Cold, Cold Heart\". I also made the same statement on her cover of Mississippi John Hurt's \"Beulah Land\" on his tribute album. Finally, I noted the fine job that she did on a duet with John Prine on \"Wedding Bells\" on his \"In Spite Of Ourselves\" cover album of country classics.\n\nThat said, although I have high, very high regard for Ms. Williams' cover work I am more ambivalent about her own albums. This album under review is such a case. I do not understand what is driving her on some of these songs. She, obviously, can write thoughtfully of love, lost, the cruel nature of the world, her family and other subjects but for the most part that feeling I got from the above-mentioned efforts is missing here. A few do, however, stand out. \"Mama You Sweet\", \"Words\", \"West\" and \"Rescue\" clearly rise to the occasion. As I say, the rest is so-so and suffer a little from trying to cross-over from her country base.","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"It's been 3 years since Korn released an album, and their last 2 releases (See You On The Other Side and Untitled) received less than favorable reviews.  I see nothing wrong with a band wanting to keep things interesting by changing up their sound or stretching their wings, but their newer stuff just didn't pack the kind of punch their earlier albums did.  For this album, the remaining members of Korn continually mentioned that they were returning to the raw sound of their first 2 albums.  They even got their old producer Ross Robinson back and called it Korn III (even though it's their 9th album).  This is the second time the band claimed to be going back to their roots (Take A Look In The Mirror), but much like last time they didn't fully accomplish that.  The band did manage to cut back on the electronics and strip their sound down again, which proved to be a good idea since this is better than their last 2 albums.  But try as they might, this is only 3\/5 of the original Korn and their writing style has evolved quite a bit over the years.  The most notable difference between the band in '95 and now is that Jon Davis's voice has changed a lot.  While the album as a whole doesn't sound like the original Korn, there are bits and pieces spread throughout that will remind you of the band's old ways.  Anyway, I'm done comparing this to their older records, let's just focus on how good the music is.\n\nThe album begins with Oildale (Leave Me Alone), a song with a familiar and refreshing crunch that we haven't heard in a while.  It's a good tune, but I'm not sure it's a good choice as a single since it doesn't really stand out in the band's catalogue like Freak On A Leash or even Coming Undone does.  Pop A Pill has a guitar riff that sounds like old-school Korn, and the verse is kinda nutty like something from Life Is Peachy, but the chorus sounds like anything else from Korn's last several albums.  Fear Is A Place To Live is pretty catchy, nothing special about the sound but it's easy to sing along to.  Move On is one of my favorites, it has that groove to it that Korn used to have in all their songs but only finds once in a while now.  Lead The Parade is good, it has another old-school guitar riff with a creepy chorus.  Let The Guilt Go is another favorite of mine, it sounds like new Korn but it has a good rhythm and I bet it sounds cool live.  The Past is kinda forgettable, it's closer to something from the band's last album.  Never Around reminds me of something from Untouchables but without all the effects.  Are You Ready To Live is a cool track, another standout but nothing mind blowing.  Holding All These Lies isn't bad but it's not memorable.  If you get the deluxe version of this album, you'll get 2 more studio tracks.  Trapped Underneath The Stairs is another Untouchables sounding tune, nothing special.  People Pleaser is really cool though, the melody in the chorus is like that of old Korn.\n\nSo basically what you get here is if you took the sound of their first album and Life Is Peachy, and then put it in a blender with the sounds of Untouchables and Take A Look In The Mirror.  I'd have to say that it's quite a step up for the band over the last 6 years, but I think it's also fair to say the band is over their artistic hill.  Overall, this is a fairly good Korn record and I seem to enjoy it more on each listen.  But things just haven't been the same since Head and David left, and it seems somewhat silly for Jon to still be screaming and crying when he has a wife, kids, a mansion and tons of money.  This might make a good high note for the band to go out on.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"...Which is my only complaint with this record. I pre-ordered the whole thing over a month ago and got the free download. After a month of digesting, I must say that this really is not as musically redeeming as other NIN albums, and thats not because of the lack of vocals. I've always loved NIN since the Broken days and I think every album up to this one was great in its own way. To me, each track on Ghosts seems like an incomplete musical idea. As soon as one track starts to build and get interesting, it ends. Other tracks are just looped sound effects with no real variation. More than anything, this album is a fantastic showcase of electronic sound effects. I think its really cool the types of sounds Trent has made with his electronical synths and moogs, and other various toys. Ghosts really shows you what you are capable of doing with todays modern electronic musical equipment. Sadly, as a NIN album it failed to hold my attention, even as background music. I think if Trent were to take the strongest tracks here and have them fully realized into songs, then it would really feel like a new NIN album. This is an experimental effort only. But a cool one. Needless to say, I don't think its worth the $300 dollars (now $600 on ebay) for the special Ed with the Vinyl records. Bottom line, definitely get this if you are a NIN fan at all because it is a fun listen and there are cool sounds on here. Just beware, as the songs don't tend to go anywhere. Have fun.","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"I've never wrote a review before as far as any Taylor Swift album goes but I feel that this album is worthy of a review. Ya see, I previously owned \"Fearless\" but never really cared much for any more of Taylor's music even though I dug that album. \"Speak Now\" was by far a better album in my opinion, so I just bought \"Speak Now\" along with \"Red\" to cap it all off. My main focus was \"Red\" though, as I wanted it even more than any of her other albums including the much improved \"Speak Now.\" I was ready for it & it was ready for me, no doubt. I'm at least twice the fan of hers now just because of this very album, so that's gotta say something, ya know?\n\nAnyways, once I opened up my first package the night I got it it had the \"Speak Now\" album inside. As always, I was quite delighted in inviting even more new music into my already overflowing yet just right for me size collection but I still knew that I had to unfortunately wait even longer until \"Red\" was in my hands! Shortly after it arrived, it only took a few quick listens until it was quite evident to me that \"Red\" was by far her best album even though her latest album also had it's high points. I certainly hope that she's able to come up with another \"Red\" type album in the very near future no matter what heartache or joy it might take to inspire her enough to do so though. Please make it \"bleed\" again Taylor! Make it \"bleed\" for all of us...lol! So many tracks on this album already were &\/or should've been hits by her too. \"1989\" is quite good in itself too but this album certainly isn't \"1989\" that we're talking about here, as it's so much better than that in my opinion. You live, you listen & you learn though.\n\nAs far as tracks go though, I really like the first 4 songs in particular but there's so much more well beyond that. \"Holy Ground\" is easily amongst one of my all time favorite songs of hers, while the track right after that is just beautifully deep & dark yet emotionally uplifting all at once, ya see? The next track's relatively hip & jumpy which works out quite well after immersing yourself in the previous song's sparkle & depth. \"Sad Beautiful Tragic\" comes off as being one of her best tracks that, whether intentionally wrote that way or not, could quickly take me right inside of her body both emotionally & physically right thru the deepest possible breath of her tightest possible kiss if you know what I mean. It's just that damn powerful! Sit outside & take a deep look into the late sky while listening to \"Starlight\" too, as it shines \"All Too Well\" too...lol. In the end though, most of the tracks on the album have their high points except of course that useless & annoying Ed Sheeran track. He can tour with her or do whatever else he'd like to but it just sickens me that he had to interfere with one of Taylor's tracks on her best album just because they're apparently friends, ya know? Skip Ed Sheeran's filth & the rest is gold though...lol! Even still, any & all of Taylor's fans must own &\/or get this album of hers especially if you already like any of her other stuff, as it's highly recommended indeed track 14 aside!","classification":4,"fold":3}

There's no accompaniment, no guitar or organ or other instruments, but that aids the song rather than detracting from it, giving us a song beautiful in its simplicity.  And though the verses are almost identical, the only variation being the addition of mentions of \"brothers,\" \"sister,\" \"fathers,\" \"mothers,\" and \"sinners,\" I didn't find myself growing annoyed or bored by the song.  In fact, I eventually found myself singing along with it.\n\nA pretty gospel number, this is definitely a must-own track, even if you're not a fan of the movie or the rest of the soundtrack.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"As far as the Dixie Chicks go, I've actually liked the singing of sisters Martie & Emily even better than Natalie Maines', even before Natalie joined the DCs and they became so big in the entertainment business.  So I was very interested and eager to hear this new album by the sisters as Court Yard Hounds.  It pretty much lives up to my expectation.  The songs are all written or co-written by Emily, several with help from Martin Strayer, only one written by the sisters together (\"Ain't No Son,\" one of the best tunes).  The style of songs falls loosely into a mainstream blend of country, rock, and folk, all featuring very fine vocals from E&M, often in sweet harmony.  As for how the music compares to Dixie Chicks, it's a little slower tempo in general, \"Ain't No Son\" being one of the few energetic rockers.  The softer, slower approach doesn't bother me too much, allowing the good vocals to take center stage.  One or two songs, such as \"Gracefully,\" do drag a bit, to a slightly dreary extent.  The backing band is manned by skilled veterans, including Ms Maines' dad, TX studio maestro Lloyd Maines.  As for the future of Court Yard Hounds, I'm not looking to see this incarnation of the sisters again any time soon, with an upcoming Chicks tour opening for the Eagles.  It seems CYH might be something the sisters come back to from time to time, but their main focus will stay on the Chicks.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Basie's best players come to Duke's place, the Columbia Records 30th Street Studios in 1961 and face Ellington's finest. Not a battle, but not quite a merger, either, since the Count's contingent is heard in one speaker and their hosts in another channel. There's more than an hour of good music on here, laid down in the dying days of big jazz touring orchestras. Popular tastes had changed and the costs of keeping large groups of players together were impossible. This is one of those rare CD's in which the booklet is almost as good as the music. This one reveals that during this 12-hour late-afternoon-to-early-morning session, one of Ellington's long-time employees quit the group forever because the boss would not take his side in a fight with a colleague. Also interesting is the dispute over the title and cover graphics. Basie hated Columbia's first idea to bill the date as a competition, and his agent even destroyed the only copy of the original cover art. The end result is an album whose sales over 40 years have been hurt because no one knows its name. The cover finally chosen says \"The Count Meets the Duke\" but in larger letters it declares \"FIRST TIME!\" and then adds \"2 Great Orchestras\" and finally states \"Duke Ellington and Count Basie.\" The label Columbia\/Sony put on the disc itself for this reissue says \"Duke Ellington MEETS Count Basie\" which makes no sense because they had known each other since the 20's. If you already like both orchestras, you'll want to own this late career session. If you want an introduction to each group in its waning years,  the CD serves nicely for that, too. This disc really jives, so don't be expecting any ballads here.","classification":5,"fold":3}
{"text":"I'm going to make this review brief, because honestly I am not a big O fan. First I will say that O's last solo album 21 was good, but I kind of had a feeling that Ollusion was going to be a disappointment. First off, he took WAAAYYY to long to put out his follow up to 21 (I don't count Faceoff as a Omarion album), taking a little over three years to put out a very short album. Second, he made triple label switch before this album going from the decent T.U.G label, to Lil Wayne's monster Young Money label, than switched again to the EMI label...what was he thinking??? I personally think he would have been just fine staying with T.U.G.\/Universal, and he surely would have been successful on Young Money, but when he left Young Money for EMI thats where I lost him, because Marques Houston did the same thing earlier in 2009 when he left TUG for EMI and his last album (Mr. Houston) absolutely flopped on the charts and it was pretty bad. It could be potentially career ending for Marques Houston? So why did his half-brother (Music & Blood lol) make the exact same dangerous move??? I don't have a clue, but it definitely did make a large difference in his music and not in a good way. The production on Ollusion is the first big problem i noticed with the album, as it was pretty evident that the label downgrade brought in a lot less big names on the production credits. Previous collaborator Tank (The Underdogs) and T-Pain are the only truly big name producers on the album, and they both only contribute one track. \"I Get It In\", produced by Tank is the extremely catchy first single, and O does kind of bite Lil' Wayne's mumbling rap style on this track, but its still one of the few standouts on the album. And the T-Pain produced \"Sweet Hangover\" is another very catchy potential single with more mid tempo club track that you would expect from T-Pain complete with his signature snaps and the dreaded auto-tune, but luckily for Omarion, he pulls it off with this track. But other than those two tracks, and the mid tempo ballad \"Speedin\" and the relaxed \"What Do You Say\", everything on the album is completely forgettable. Where Omarion really messed up on this album was with the cheap knock off production from no-namers like 253 (who produced almost half the album), Detail (Ray J's Main Producer...thats all that needs to be said), and Marques Houston (lol). And even though Maddscientist is an alright producer, \"I Think My Girl Is Bi\" is a terrible and extremely annoying...it's very similar to a club\/radio track from Lady Gaga, which means that even though the song is absolutely terrible and annoying, it could potentially be a hit. And \"Temptation\" sounds like a cheap knock off of Usher's \"Confessions\"... A really, really, really cheap knock off. And both tracks produced by Mr. Houston himself are terribly boring attempts at babymakers. Overall Ollusion just kind of comes off as rushed and cheap. I mean its not a terrible album, its just nothing special...at all. I mean look at the first week sales of all three of his albums, 2005's \"O\"- 195,000 units sold 1st week, 2006's \"21\"- 119,000 units sold 1st week, and 2010's \"Ollusion\"- 21,200 copies sold 1st week...thats a bad falloff.\n\nGrade:\nC","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library.  With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing.  It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.  Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon.  Thats right!  Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too.  In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.

{"text":"OK, so the title \"The Carter\" has run its course.  I wish he would be more creative with his album titles.  One can't help but have a premonition that his next album will be called \"The Carter IV\"; he needs to cut that out.  However, as an album, this album is very different with the futuristic sounds namely.  Dwayne Michael Carter proves that he has what it takes to be a great rapper because he is one.  Too, his personality just draws you to him.\n\n To say that \"Lollipop\" is a huge hit is an understatement.  The song and video are played constantly on television and radio.  Not to mention the fact that countless people have the song as their ringtone and\/or play the song just for fun on the phones just so the public can know that they love Lil' Wayne.  While that usually becomes extremely annoying to me, I am not yet tired of this song, probably because it is so different from what is out.  If you have heard this song, then you can imagine the tone of the rest of the album; it is similar to that song.  Tracks such as \"Shoot Me Down\", \"La La\" and \"You Ain't Got Nothin\" follow similar formulas to \"Lollipop.\"  Fabolous and Juelz Santana lend their talents to \"You Ain't Got Nothin'\", and Fabolous does a fantastic job, as does Wayne.  Juelz usually does well with his versus, but the one on this song is sub par compared to what I've heard him do.  This song is inundated with drum and guitar, but so are most of the songs on this album.  \"Comfortable\" features Babyface and was produced by the phenomenal Kanye West, and the finished product is great and it is a different style for Wayne.  He gives an energetic performance and spits some great lines.  This song is for his woman, but it seems as though he's praising her and disrespecting her at the same time.  I was surprised yet thrilled to see Jay-Z show up on \"Mr. Carter.\"  But, it works so well because both of them share the same surname.  Both of them give great lyrical performances.\n\n In short, if you like \"Lollipop\", I can assure you that you will like the vast majority of this album.  Be advised, though, this album is not like \"The Carter I\" or \"The Carter II.\"  Wayne does things differently this time around and I already know that some people will like it and some will shun.  I liked it, personally.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"Lollipop\"\n2. \"Dontgetit\"\n3. \"Comfortable\"\n4. \"Mr. Carter\"\n5. \"Got Money\"","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Lovely music!\n\nThis beautiful album was RECORDED on September 16 and 17 (not originally released as the data on the amazon claimed at the time I wrote this review)- Kenny Burrell, a true giant of mainstream and moderately modern jazz guitar really shines here in the illustrious company of Richard Davis on bass and Roy Haynes on drums.\n\nSome of the songs are really swinging, some are beautifully sad, some are pretty darn modern, but the general feeling of the album would be - in my interpretation - warm. The cozy tone of the leader's guitar really enriches his fanciful solo flights as well as the numbers where the rest of the trio has a larger role.\n\nInitially issued on LP in 1960, the album was re-released in 1966 under the title \"Man at Work\", with really beautiful photo by Don Brownstein reproduced inside the CD's package (the cover photo of Burrell, taken from the original edition, is by Chuck Stewart). Actually, my only problem with this lovely CD is that the original liner notes - printed twice, are too small even for a reasonably young fellow with a normal eye-sight... Keeping the cover art was smart, but the backside of LP is not visually interesting enough to compensate for too small letters.\n\nIf you like jazz-guitar or mainstream jazz, you should get this album, to hear fresh and convincing versions of various standards (f. i. Ellington-Strayhorn's \"Just a sittin' and a-rockin'\", Monk's \"Well, You Needn't\") as well as some less often performed songs.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Back in the late 1980's, a countless amount of hair bands were polluting the radio and MTV and killing the ozone layer. It seemed like there was no end in sight. Until 1991...\nThere's a reason why this is listed as one of the most influential albums ever released. Sure, the music might sound simple at first listen, but listen harder. Kurt Cobain is pouring his heart and soul out in this recording (and all of his other ones) for everyone to hear. He was telling the tale of Generation X: the long-haired, moody, grungy teenagers who just stopped caring. And he described them to a T. Which could be why \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" sparked a revolution in 1991: people haven't heard anything like it before on mainstream radio, and were fascinated by the louder, angrier sounds they were hearing coming from their speakers.\nBut nevermind that. (no pun intended) If you're an alternative music fan, you probably own this. If not, this album combines punk, alternative, grunge with great pop melodies that helped this album sell millions of copies. Every single song on here is good, there is no need to skip over any.

I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.

{"text":"I think Dave Mustaine has arguably again matched the classic album \"Rust in Peace\" but even moreso than with \"Endgame\". This album, \"Dystopia\" sounds like it could fit in between \"Rust in Peace\" and \"Countdown to Extinction\"  and to lesser extents \"Peace Sells\" and \"So Far\" at times with the way that it sounds but there is so much musical complexity and excellent songwriting and musicianship here. Dave Mustaine's voice also is wonderful on here; I prefer it to any other album he's released I think. He layers it but has a powerful, rough delivery and sometimes has harmonies mixed in lower which sounds cool. The songs themselves are each amazing in their own right and there's even an instrumental that is up there with Metallica's best ones (Orion, Call of Ktulu)). Megadeth definitely breaks barriers as far as guitar work is concerned here. This is some of Dave Mustaine's best guitar work and composition to date in my opinion. I know hype often disappoints but if you are a Megadeth fan or even a metal fan, I think you will love this album. It is a masterpiece and I am glad that I got the version that allows you to order a vinyl copy. I'm also glad that Dave could put something like this out for the younger kids and show them what true metal is (I think Slayer did a great job with keeping things going too with their new one even with a new guitarist and drummer). If you are kind of iffy about the band because of record like Risk and World Needs a Hero, never fear, \"Dystopia\" is here. Recommended!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"The Color Before The Sun is the innovative American Prog\/Punk\/Rock\/Metal hybrid band Coheed & Cambrias eight full-length studio album, it was produced by the band and Jay Joyce (who also contributes some piano) and released in 2015.\n\nThat hybrid sound isn't quite so pronounced this time around though. Theres nothing on here thats as heavy as the bands heaviest output, theres nothing as progressive as the bands most progressive moments, theres nothing as fast as the bands fastest moments. Nothing is so sugary or so lush as the bands most grandiose ballads of yore. Theres no summery happy single. Theres no Welcome Home or No World For Tomorrow or Domino The Destitute or Sentry The Defiant type big smashing centrepiece either. Even Sanchezs usually immensely emotional, evocative and expressive vocals are a bit more restrained. Hes usually singing about the most dramatic point in a characters entire life, and Claudio can really make you feel that. Here he still has the talent and the signature style but the performance is a bit more held back, a foot off the gas pedal and less hair raising.\n\nAs an album; its very much Coheed on the medium setting. As such, it took the album a bit longer to really click with me than usual but click it did. Ill admit, the very first time I heard this record in full I didn't like it much and I could imagine it getting bad reviews from professional critics without the time to really let it sink in because of the fact its such a grower and it does take a bit of listening to reveal all its secrets and hidden depths. Its not even as if its a return to roots or going back to their early sound either because although its poppy and cheerful it doesnt really sound much like Second Stage Turbine Blade either. Its a bit more raw, honest, stripped back and realistic. The emotions are more human. If you're willing to give it a chance, the qualitys absolutely there though.\n\nThe other big talking point about this record is that the lyrics are no longer conceptual or telling the Amory Wars story, but youd be hard pressed to notice sometimes with all the mentioning of moons and planets and returning words and ideas the band always use like home and love etc. The band write about relationships, fatherhood, artistry and similar topics here, same as always in one way, just without the sci-fi angle. Theres some great memorable lines here, with Ghosts, Atlas and The Audience being especially interesting.\n\nThe album also goes to town on lots of sing-along moments, theres a real surplus of woah ah oooohs and da dada das. It seems like the band are compensating for the lack of power with pleasant smiley moments, and it works well. Theres also a few really sweet, enjoyable guitar lines thatll stick in your head. Now, on top of that there are some seriously fun moments and memorable choruses; the opener Island as well as the singles Here To Mars and Youve Got Spirit, Kid in particular are all worth checking out. Another major highlight is the subtle and understated ballad Ghost which has some different sounding vocals from Claudio.\n\nOverall; this is a more mature, mid-paced, cohesive and restrained album from Coheed & Cambria. It isn't as instant or dramatic or adventurous as some of the bands back catalogue but it is enjoyable and it is worth your time. Theres just something very good about it, it is a real grower, its earthy and honest and it is just very well crafted and succinct with no filler and an absolute boatload of hooks. I recommend it to anyone whos ever had an interest in the group.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"In a final product that's sure to receive divided opinions among a diverse fanbase, Spark Seeker sees Matisyahu taking a left turn firmly into electronic and jazzed up production. This is not an album done in the reggae style, or even in the polished rock style seen on Youth and Light.\n\nSpark Seeker's a very different type of album, one that mixes hi-tech, busy, and heavily synthesized production with Middle-Eastern instruments for a very cool new sound for him.\n\nI wasn't sure what to initially think when I heard that Matisyahu was heading in this direction. Most fans, I'd think, have always preferred his live albums to Youth and Light mainly because of the rawer, more energetic sound that comes with a band playing the music. His studio albums, on the other hand, always blended this style with poppier and more mainstream production.\n\nWith Spark Seeker, we see the album diving headfirst into this type of production, and I have to express my surprise; it's all the better for it. By sticking firmly to its style instead of tepidly balancing between the two, I feel that this is Matisyahu's most cohesive and energetic studio album to date, with songs that blend well together while all still sounding like something unique and different. The CD's meant to be played loud and with the bass cranked up and it's an experience all its own.\n\nCrossroads is an incredible way to kick things off, and this transitions into one of only 3 (somewhat) traditional songs on the album, Sunshine. Searching, Buffalo Soldier, and Fire of Freedom all bring something totally new to the table while all coming off as incredibly catchy. Bal Shem Tov has an atmospheric start as the music beautifully fades in, this one including some incredible lyrics. I Believe in Love is another one in the style of Sunshine, Breathe Easy's another energetic and uplifting song, and Live Like a Warrior's the 3rd \"traditional\" track. Tel Aviv'n's an adventure through not only Israel but Matisyahu's personal journey and it's an incredible listen with even more uplifting lyrics. King Crown of Judah's a complete Israeli hip hop track and one of my favorites on the CD, though I wish Matisyahu rapped for two verses instead of just one, especially since the first verse is Shyne's 2nd guest appearance on the CD.\n\nThe only song I'm not too crazy about is the CD closer, Shine on You, but from what I hear it's one of Matisyahu's favorites on the CD, (that and Crossroads) so maybe it'll grow on me.\n\nSpark Seeker's a pretty incredible record; while definitely the production and musical style may not be most fans' cup of tea, if you set your expectations for what Matisyahu should sound like aside and just listen to the warm melodies and uplifting lyrics, you may find yourself loving this album for what it is.\n\nI hope that Matisyahu and the Dub Trio release a raw and fully instrumental album next time around (he says it's not too far off, so I'm excited for it) but I also love Spark Seeker, and hope fans give it a chance.","classification":5,"fold":3}

Man, ordering this CD was one of my best decisions in recent memory; this is a dynamite and dynamic album!\n\nCall this band country, or country-rock, or alt-country, or whatever, but this is simply great music. These songs pack a punch with outstanding musicianship (love that fiddle playing!) and soothe the soul with intelligent lyrics. Few groups nowadays can combine lyrical depth with musical prowess, but the Turnpike Troubadours excel at both. At times their sound reminds me of the Drive-By Truckers (or even ex-DBT singer-guitarist Jason Isbell) or groups like Whiskeytown and the Old 97s. They've got that same spirit and positive attitude. Songs with passion and intelligence, and unbridled energy. I'll take that! From the first track to the last, this is really an incredibly impressive album.\n\nPerhaps the highest recommendation I can make is that after playing this CD a dozen-plus times, I was so impressed that I ordered another CD by the Turnpike Troubadours.

Wading, the second track from her second album Souled Out works very well. She does deliver a hypnotic song in her heart, without feeling jaded at the end. It does follow up with what The Pressure did so well. It is a good song that works at the heart from her soul. It sounds much better than most of the artists that have came out with music this past year, and I sincerely hope that she can keep delivering with great songs. She should get more credit than what others are showing in her.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"I'm going to set myself apart from most of the other reviewers here by saying that right from the beginning, Mumford & Sons were far from something 'new' with a 'new' sound. I have other artists who beat Mumford & Sons to the punch when it comes to banjos, let's try Bruce Hornsby & The Range a la 1986. Or, how about Dexy's Midnight Runners a la 1983? I'm sure there are even earlier examples in rock music. So, for me, although I liked \"Little Lion Man\" and \"The Cave\" from Mumford & Sons 2009 debut, \"Sigh No More\" (a play on Monty Python's \"Say No More\"?), they weren't original. They were good, and they were something different from what was being played on the radio\/television at that time, but \"Sigh No More\" suffered from repetitiveness, as did their second album, 2012's \"Babel\", and so does 2015's \"Wilder Mind\".\n\nIt didn't matter that the band changed instruments. No, not really. The problem is still the same--12 songs all pretty similar. You could interchange them for each other, shuffle them about, and still end up with nothing better than three stars here. I'm convinced these guys are not all that talented, just like Kings Of Leon, who they appear to strongly resemble on \"Wilder Mind\". You see, both bands have offered nothing new. They have created some good songs, but their albums haven't been all that great when taken as a whole. There are too many songs that are just plain filler. \"Wilder Mind\" is no different.\n\n\"Tompkins Square Park\", \"Believe\", \"Wilder Mind\", \"Monster\", \"Ditmas\" and \"Only Love\" are the standout tracks here. The rest just fill in the gaps.\n\nSo, Mumford & Sons, what will you do next? What will your next move be? Three albums in, and you already sound tired and out of ideas. I think the right thing to do is still with your 'roots' music and adapt it. That's what Bruce Hornsby did, and he did it exceptionally well. However, if you go that route, you will not be popular and sell millions, but you will have a hardcore fan base that will financially support you for the duration of your career. But, like Hornsby, you have to have talent, and you have to practice your instruments 8 hours per day. That's what Hornsby does to stay in musical shape, and it shows on his albums, and in his concerts. Or, you could go the Tracy Chapman route, where you release a new album every five years or so, and it's always solid, and again, you won't see millions, but you will have a loyal following and either approach will give you artistic credit. What you have done on \"Wilder Mind\" is attempt a U2 \"Achtung Baby\" without really earning it. Plus, you came off sounding like Kings Of Leon rather than something fresh and new.\n\nSo, here's how \"Wilder Mind\" compares with Mumford & Sons previous albums:\n\n2009 Sigh No More: Three Stars\n2012 Babel: Three Stars\n2015 Wilder Mind: Three Stars","classification":3,"fold":3}

If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button (triangle).\n\nOr, if you just want to build up your music collection the starving-college-student way, Amazon offers a ton of FREE music downloads. Free songs...even free albums. And more important than free. LEGAL. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But, quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nIf you think you might like this song...listen to a sample first. No review will help you make a better decision than doing that. I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was one of the Amazon freebies, previously mentioned.

{"text":"I have always liked Bossa Nova - my first Jazz CD was \"Getz\/Gilberto\". Most of these songs I am familiar with on the original Portuguese, I've heard them that way for decades. A few of Jobim's songs were translated over the years, but not that many. Portuguese is a wonderfully mellifluous language, someone could read the phone book in Portuguese and it would sound good. Other than the Getz Bossa Nova albums I like \"Tom and Elis\". If you look at Samba, it is much more percussive and upbeat whereas Jobim's Bossa Nova lends itself to melancholy treatment by Getz or Sinatra. For what it's worth, Jobim himself preferred these heavily orchestrated versions of his works to to the leaner version on \"Getz\/Gilberto\", \"Jazz Samba\" and \"Tom and Elis\".\n\nDespite the rave reviews elsewhere, I thought \"Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim\" was disappointing, much too short and I had no idea why songs like \"Baubles, Bangles and Beeds\", \"Change Partners\" and \"I Concentrate on You\", non-Jobim song were included when so many of my favorite Jobim songs were missing.\n\nWell I found this new \"Sinatra\/Jobim\" compilation just wonderful. There are a lot more of the missing Jobim songs from that other album but more important there are translations! I don't know if these are real translations, I don't speak Portuguese, sometimes singers just make up new words. But herein Sinatra does his peerless job of presenting the true emotional feelings behind the lyrics. Particularly good are his renderings or translations of \"Agua de Beber\", \"Desafinado\", \"Samba de Uma Nota So\", \"Wave\" and \"Triste\". Even if the older Sinatra does have a little trouble reaching that last note in \"Wave\", what he looses in tonal accuracy, he gains in emotional depth.\n\nI love early Sinatra's stuff, I mostly like his Capitol records and pre-fifties treatments, where he poured his soul into the singing. When he was in love with Ava Gardner, when he had the mob make an offer to a Hollywood director that he couldn't refuse to get Sinatra into \"From Here to Eternity\" and save his career. Much of his post 1960 Reprise\/Rat Pack\/Ringa ding ding stuff leaves me cold. But on this two album combo Concord has put together memorable Sinatra with translations of great Jobim songs I've never heard before. \"Sinatra\/Jobim\" is much more Jobim than \"Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim\".\n\nRecommended","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I heard some mention about Robert Randolph & the Family Band here and there from various sources. But when I saw them perform on The Tonight Show one night, that was all I needed. I instantly rushed out and picked up the album.\nTo say that this album, Unclassified, is great would be an understatement. Robert Randolph and his band (consisting of all family members, in case the name didn't tip you off) provide this great album full of funk and soul. There are a few instrumental tracks that just let the band do their thing, like \"Run For Your Life\", the calypso style of, well, \"Calypso\", and the best one, \"Squeeze\". And the songs you should've heard already, \"Going In the Right Direction\" and \"I Need More Love\", still sound excellent.\nOther standouts are the funky \"Soul Refreshing\" and \"Why Should I Feel Lonely\". I even like \"Problems\", a we-are-the-world style song that doesn't sound so clichd. Actually, there's no song on here that's a waste of time.

{"text":"Tim McGraw is one of the few regular Nashville hitmakers who manages to sing songs with substance.  As trite as \"Live Like You Were Dying\" may be, it spoke to people; it's a song with true lasting power.  Not all of the tunes collected here are (\"Indian Outlaw\" is best forgotten), but surprisingly, they are all well-crafted, solid tunes performed by a man who knows how to deliver a song.\n\nThe new single, \"It Felt Good On My Lips,\" isn't worth the price of admission alone; it's a strong enough tune (another Warren Brothers number), but far from the best here.  McGraw is at his best when he's digging deep down for emotion (\"Grown Men Don't Cry,\" \"Please Remember Me\") or cutting loose (\"Real Good Man,\" \"Something Like That\").  Intermediary tunes like \"Watch the Wind Blow By\" lag behind; but fortunately, these numbers are few and far between.\n\nNUMBER ONE HITS may be an unnecessary collection for McGraw fans (who probably have all the albums already), but if you're just turning onto his music, it's a solid place to start.  Never a truly great artist, McGraw does sometimes break out of Nashville's boundaries (\"Last Dollar\" is a perfect example), creating radio-friendly music with an artistic bent.  This album showcases him as his best--which, even his critics have to admit, is pretty darn good.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"If a woman's soul can be tortured, she has every right to proclaim her emotive state to the high heavens. Her exquisite nature - when agitated beyond reasonable expectations in a romance - becomes less than civil - she has to shout out her romantic frustrations to be heard correctly. This is perhaps the case with the now famous power ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\"; sung by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler; written\/produced by the gifted Jim Steinman; backup vocals by Rory Dodd (who can be distinctly heard singing `echo'), Eric Troyer, and Bryan Adams. One can only assume that Pagan Norse sirens - gathering themselves from a swim across the tumultuous fjords - commanded the `backup vocals' in order to heighten the experience for one and all. Such is the case with our brilliant vocalist Tyler, whose presence alone is ethereal and whose magnificent voicing in this particular song - gave rise to the tidal wave that followed once this classic & epic song was released around the world to great acclaim and praise.\n\nSuffice it to say that we can replay this song to our heart's content on any given, bleached out, saddened afternoon - and remove ourselves from any doldrums by soaking up again the powerful crescendos and decrescendos within this romantic Valhalla ballad. Can only assume Tyler is singing for Viking women-warriors throughout the land, who carry torches for their men (hopefully not to burn them where it truly hurts) and howl at the moonface of their melancholia rather than remain passive and complacent.\n\n\"And I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you'll only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong together\nWe can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nNothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\"","classification":5,"fold":3}

This can explain why I keep only about half the songs from this album on my iPhone 5.\n\nOverall, as classic of an album as this is, and while Nirvana themselves may be galaxies above anything on MTV or the radio nowadays, I still STRONGLY disagree with this album being #2 on VH1's 100 Greatest Albums of Rock N' Roll (behind only \"Revolver\" by The Beatles), and even more so with Nirvana getting #6 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock (behind Metallica, AC\/DC, Jimi Hendrix, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, in ascending order).","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"Yes, as the headline reads, it is in actuality they're last progressive metal album produced. Q2K, Tribe, Take Cover, Hear In The Now Frontier, American Soldier, Dedicated To Chaos were not Progressive albums. They were more metal, straightforward rock than anything else. This album though, has songs like the title track, Out of Mind, Disconnected and Someone Else that are progressive songs, not only because of their longitude but because of the structure.\n\nThis album is nearly flawless in my opinion, it's dark and very moody. Tate's voice sounded amazing on tracks like \"I Am I, Promised Land, My Global Mind and Bridge\". My top 5 songs from this album are: \"My Global Mind, I Am I, Damaged, Lady Jane and Someone Else\".\n\nEverything found in this album is how they were before but darker. Absolutely great album!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"It is absolutely so sad that a artist can push the envelope so much, that they are just so tiring and more annoying in their music. Tragically, Rihanna is one of those artists that really made their own sound so severely overexposed, that Rihanna has now been more of a product, and less of a songstress on the inside. With all the hype that she had put out for her Anti album, she really has felt more like a whimper, and more of a joke of herself. When I first heard Work, I not only thought the song was poor in her voice, where she sounded tired and choppy, or someone who was experimenting on drugs, but she really doesn't have anywhere else to go, to find better inspiration that just go on replay with the same sounds over and over again. Kiss It Better was no better, and that also goes with Needed Me, the third single from the Anti album. I definitely found the song to be one step back from her earlier, earlier work like S.O.S., and Umbrella. She really didn't even come close to where she could ignite beyond aflame, and instead saw afire get dowsed into small ashes of the soul. I really found the song to be a waste of time, and on the ears. Perhaps, Rihanna should just go off and retire, because her sound is sincerely short of being needed.\n\nSong: D 1\/2-","classification":2,"fold":3}

The song has a bravado beat and has the operatic feel that most of the album has. Not some of Kanye's best lyrics, but there is already so much going on that it's not that noticeable.

{"text":"They've turned up the guitars and let them rip. Motion City Soundtrack work the best elements of pop-punk (think Blink-182, whose Mark Hoppus produces) and hyper-powered emo (think Fall Out Boy at their accelerated best) for \"My Dinosaur Life.\" It's adolescent rock with punky snottiness mixed in with the catchy melodies and flippant attitude, all while poking fun at the whole genre.\n\nAfter all, what band would openly cop to 'watching Veronica Mars again' while waiting up for their girlfriend without the credibility swirling the drain? Or claim that they should be better respected because of their good behavior, which they do on the opening track \"Worker Bee\"? But then they blow that opportunity sky-high with the musically hysterical \"@!#?@!\" where they go to the falsettos when they sing the Mother F-er chorus. It's a good joke and doesn't wear thin after repeated listens (as does the wretched \"F-You\" by Cee-lo).\n\nDespite the humor, these are terse songs about relationships. Motion City Soundtrack pump enough energy into \"Disappear,\" \"Her Words Destroyed My Planet\" or \"History Lesson\" (the obvious single) to cover the bitterness, and even when a savage lyric that describes a failed relationship as being\n\n\"Like a slasher film,\nI'm torn in all directions,\nthe plot sucks\nbut the killings are gorgeous\"\n\nyou can't help but smile. \"My Dinosaur Life\" is one of my faves for the year.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"There's some decent live singing here but also some just average to somewhat bad vocals. Katy Perry is not known for having powerful vocals and this demonstrates that she clearly does not but thankfully she doesn't try to hit the notes she just can't hit so what you get is a more relaxed tone which is soothing but maybe a little too soothing as it can get a little dull. The lyrics also suffer quite considerably...without all the bells and whistles your attention is drawn to the occasionally poorly written lyrics particularly in I Kissed a Girl. While Brick by Brick is a pretty song it's so slow and just, again, dull.\n\nSadly the best performance is definitely Hackensack [a cover song] so the lyrics don't suffer. While still offering some dull moments \"Lost\" is one of the better songs performed...\"Waking Up in Vegas\" is okay, with that main problem again being the attention to the lyrics which fall apart during a live acoustic performance such as this. The main thing here is the band, not the vocals, as they provide great instrumentals.

{"text":"Mint Condition was a bit of an anomaly in the New Jack Swing era. They were one of the only few bands that were a self-contained unit- being the sole writers, producers and performers of their own material. Since their debut in 1991, the Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis proteges have amassed a significant body of work and singles that are considered quiet storm favorites. Over the years, they have had moderate success with two Gold singles (1992's \"Breakin' My Heart (Pretty Brown Eyes)\" and 1996's \"What Kind Of Man Would I Be?\"), and one Gold album (Their third album \"Definition Of A Band\"). With the success came an equal amount of setbacks, such as Jam & Lewis' Perspective Records shutting down shortly before the release of \"Definition Of Band\", and the label's parent company, A&M Records, also being shut down due to a corporate merger a mere two years later. They then embarked on a short-lived union with Elektra Entertainment for the release of 1999's underpromoted \"Life's Aquarium\". Six years would pass between albums and by the time they released their 2005 album \"Livin' The Luxury Brown\", they were on the indie label Image Entertainment, and the sextet dwindled to a quintet due to the departure of member Keri Lewis. After the release of \"E-Life\" in 2008, they laid low for a few years and resurfaced with a new album in 2011.\n\nTheir newest effort \"7...\"- named for being their seventh studio album in their 20 year career- is their first offering on their new label Shanachie Entertainment. On this new album, they decide to tone things down and show a little restraint- which means that it's a straight to the point R&B album with no interludes, no songs experimenting with other genres, and no long winded jam sessions. The album starts opens with \"Can't Get Away\", a funky ballad about a man infatuated with a woman that's up to no good. They switch things up with the synth heavy uptempo \"I Want It\", while they contemplate ending a relationship on the ballad \"Walk On\". On the single \"Caught My Eye\", Stokely sings about approaching a woman who has fancied his attention. They retrace their two decade career on the title track \"7...\", while they pay tribute to mothers on \"Unsung\". Their duet with Kelly Price \"Not My Daddy\" is a slightly altered version of the song that was leaked to the internet earlier this year. The album ends with \"20 Years Later\", a story of a man who continues to burn bridges even as he grows older. Overall, this album is probably the most restrained album that Mint Condition has ever done, and it's also their shortest in their entire catalogue. It also serves as a reminder that they are still capable of creating quality material after all these years.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"For a musician who has taken 6 years and 5 years between albums in the past, Trent Reznor sure is active lately, and we can probably thank the rising technical possibilities for working outside of record company strictures. But it's important to remember that Ghosts I-IV is NOT the next proper NiN release, and it should be viewed more accurately as a side project. Here Trent eschews lyrics and vocal melodies (his traditional Achilles heels) for 36 instrumental tracks that mostly provide atmospheres for not-so-easy-listening mood music, while highlighting Trent's sequencing and programming skills. It takes many, many listens for all of the tracks to differentiate themselves in your consciousness, but your patience will mostly be rewarded. Ghosts I-IV occasionally recalls the classic albums, delivering mood manipulation a la The Fragile (tracks #3, 11, 17, 28, 33); and surprisingly for this rather quiet collection, harsh Downward Spiral-like angst (#4, 8, 19, 23, 31). There are also a few experimental surprises that have not been heard from NiN before, such as weird bluegrass guitar (#14 - courtesy of Adrian Belew), pummeling rave (#16), old-school gangsta-hop (#24), bass-driven heavy funk-rock (#26, 27), and even vaguely Asian world music (#30).\n\nBut even with those occasional throwbacks and advances, many of the tracks on this release still have trouble rising above the pack. Primarily, almost all of the songs are just too short for their ideas to develop beyond basic introductions. In fact, just two tracks (#20, 34) feature more than one basic beat pattern or chord progression. And there are just too many weak tracks that turn moodiness into boredom - ranging from thin beat programming exercises (#9, 18), simple piano melodies propped up unsuccessfully with random noise (#10, 13, 22), and basic sequencer patterns that repeat to the point of absurdity (#6, 34). Of course, fans should feel as mellow and moody listening to Ghosts I-IV as Trent probably did while creating it. But at times there are just too many under-developed ideas vying for the listener's and the creator's attention. [~doomsdayer520~]","classification":4,"fold":3}

That's EXACTLY where we are; this is EXACTLY what we've come to. We've finally arrived at the audio jigsaw-puzzle as the airplay unit of choice. Eventually, of course (and you mark my words on this) somebody will come along and sample this unit from Flo Rida, and we'll then have a song which samples a song which samples a song which samples a song.\n\nBruh....\n\nNow that I've said all that, let me go ahead here and note how well this record works: I LOVE the end result here -- although I do gotta admit that when I first heard LEVELS from Avicii, my first thought was NOT, \"...you know, what this thing really needs is more Flo Rida in it!\" Still, what Flo Rida does here with Avicii's work is all kinds of commercial -- and I definitely hope that Avicii gets a bit of real and true organic (commercial) growth w\/re his audience from this. Too, I am quite pleased that Etta gets highlighted in what will almost certainly become a Top 5 SKU at retail (assuming this incredibly radio-friendly unit gets the push it deserves from the label, literally millions of new eardrums will become exposed to Etta's fine voice in what ought to be an absolute orgy of airplay). The final result here is an absolute eargasm.\n\nWhich really brings me to my point, here -- and YES, I do have one: Flo Rida, if you read these things, I'd like to suggest something for your live show... and it's this: before you break into Good Feeling, take a moment and play a short clip from Etta and let your audience know who she was -- and IS. She DESERVES that consideration -- and let's be fair here, okay? You OWE her, and you owe her a LOT. Take a moment during your live show, man... show a short video clip of Etta... and intro Miss Peaches to a whole new generation of listeners. Partly because it would simply be a hella cool thing to do -- but mostly because she's EARNED IT.\n\nThanks, man.\n\nThis is actually some very good work, but hey... you know, give Etta her props.\n\nI just kinda wanted to say that.\n\n4 stars... mostly because I just can't give 5 stars to something that samples a sample of a sample -- even if it IS all kinds of big-time awesome.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"When you slap on the CD or fire up your iPod what you get immediately is transported back to 1987 when Power Pop Rock (some lamely refer to it as Hair Metal) ruled MTV and the teenage world. Think Whitesnake.  Think Ratt. Think Mtley Cre and Dokken and Dio and Ozzy (Ultimate Sin era) and a slew of others. Some were good. Some were not. Resurrection Kings is being compared (on the Amazon bio blurb) to Whitesnake's mid-career self-titled album of MTV staples. Not a bad album to be compared to. Even though we grew tired of watching Tawny crawling all over Coverdale and his Jaguar it's still a stellar piece of rock. Yet here we have Craig Goldy and even though John Sykes is a guitar god, it makes it that much better. Goldy is a beast. A riff-grinding machine. The hooks run deep. Chas West sounds amazing.  The rhythm section of McNabb and Appice is tight and grooving. And Goldy makes us appreciate what we've been missing. No cheap gimmicks and flash here like so many guitarists from that era, all shred and no substance, Goldy is the real deal. Tight riffs, great chord progressions, excellent structure and a tone to die for!  Listening to this album you can tell these guys had a blast making it. There's a feel here, an indecipherable groove that you can feel on every song. \"Livin' Out Loud\"  with infect you. If you enjoy great playing and solid production and songs that straight out rock, Resurrection Kings is the cure for what's been ailing rock for years.\n\nDig it!","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"bwaaowww...that's my onomatopoeia for the guitar sound that opens #9 Dream. It sounds like an instantaneous sunrise, like bwaaowww! and the sun is up. The guitarist is Jesse Ed Davis and he is playing the sweetest wah pedal tone ever. Listening to this song is like floating on a cloud. Very much of its time, breezy mid-70s production with a heavy layer of smoothness, kind of like 10CC's 'I'm Not in Love' or The Hollies 'Air that I Breathe'.\n\nNicky Hopkins on keyboards and John's pal Klaus Voormann on bass. I always feel a little sadness about John when I hear his music, but then I know he doesn't want people hanging their heads - keep yer chin up, world! I never knew that John had used the string arrangement already, on Nilsson's version of Many Rivers to Cross. It's fun to hear it on a different song. Once in a rare while I obsess over the tinniness of the reverb used on John's voice, but it's pretty well buried under the heavy string gravy...man it's thick. But so ultra-creamy.

{"text":"Debut Albums are always crucial. It's a first impression, that really shows what you are capable of. You look at rappers like Kanye West with his incredible \"College Dropout\", Jay-Z with his debut \"Reasonable Doubt\" and even the more recent \"G.o.o.d Kid m. A.A.d City\" by Kendrick Lamar. All of these albums have set up what is and could be incredible careers for these rappers. Under Pressure by Logic absolutely has the potential to reach some of these highs. Logic has proven himself as a fantastic lyricist, and shown that his music can speak for itself instead of having to rely on gimmicky sounds and weird features.\nOne thing that is immediately noticeable when looking through this album is that, in the standard version of the album, there isn't a single guest feature. Childish Gambino and Big Sean are found on the deluxe edition, but those are just bonus tracks from his cancelled debut EP \"While You Wait\". Logic proves himself through these first 12 tracks how capable of holding down tracks as he is. Looking at the lead single from the album, also the title track \"Under Pressure\" the first three minutes are an unstoppable force of nothing but pure lyricism, and one of the most well-produced tracks of the last five years. The latter six minutes slows it down to tell a story about his father, which was kind of strange, knowing how powerful the first three minutes were, but it works overall.\nBefore the release, this album earned comparisons to albums like Kanye West's \"Graduation\" and Kendrick Lamar's \"G.o.o.d Kid m. A.A.d City\". Which is well deserved, while Kanye's \"Late Registration\" would have been a more appropriate comparison, the 'G.o.o.d kid' comparison was spot on. The songs \"Never Enough\" and \"I'm Gone\" almost sound as if they were taken right out of that album, even down to the flow and the beat. They're nearly indistinguishable from the Kendrick album which might be one slight downside to the album. There are some minor points where originality isn't quite what it should be, but even then it's not long before we get back to songs that would fit nowhere else but on this album such as \"Nikki\" and \"Bounce\".\nTowards the beginning of the album we don't get any extremely hard hitters, but we do get some very solid songs that introduce the second half of the album well. \"Soul Food\" is separated into two different sections, though neither section outshines the other. Lyrically getting down to some personal stuff; \"My other sister went back to her old dude, he's whooping her *** I'll kill him I'll kill him I really want to kill him, but I can't\". It's refreshing to see a new artist actually talking about personal things instead of going to strip clubs and stacking their money.\nLooking at the Deluxe Edition tracks, it was mostly unneeded. \"Driving Ms. Daisy\" might be one of the best tracks of the year, as the production is top-notch and both Logic and Gambino kill their verses. It's disappointing to see that one wasn't a part of the standard edition, though it makes sense it didn't make it with the Gambino feature. \"Now\" and \"Alright\" are solid tracks in their own right, but they don't fit the flow of the album incredibly well, justifying the fact that they should just be Deluxe Edition tracks.\n\"Under Pressure\" is without a doubt the best album we've seen in 2014. Nowhere does the project get boring, and only rarely does it make minor missteps. It isn't perfect, but it's the closest we've seen all year.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 9\/10\n\nMust Have Songs:\n- Under Pressure\n- Driving Ms. Daisy\n- Nikki\n- Soul Food\n- Bounce\n- Buried Alive","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"\"Pianoforte\" is Timothy Crane's third release, following \"Dragonfly\" (2010) and \"The Other Life I Dream\" (2004). A lifelong musician who started out in a rock band, Crane calls his music \"instrumental pop\" and enjoys including an assortment of musical styles in each collection. This group of twelve original pieces features the piano front and center and includes acoustic guitar by Rick Henley and orchestration created by Crane and Jason Rowsell. Like his previous albums, \"Pianoforte\" was produced on a shoestring budget by independent musicians \"who simply want to create and play music - even if it means recording on the weekends in a basement.\" Thanks to technology and Crane's experience, this does NOT sound like music recorded in a basement or garage. Styles range from quiet and reflective to more upbeat and energetic, making this a really good album for driving, working, or just kicking back and getting lost in.\n\n\"Pianoforte\" begins with \"What Will I Be?,\" a piece that begins quietly with oboe and piano, suggesting a daydream - perhaps a young child staring out a window, lost in thought. As it evolves, the piece becomes fuller and more orchestrated, sounding more like a film soundtrack. \"Awaken the Dawn\" is quite different with an effervescent piano flourish for starters and a big, powerful orchestra keeping the piece dancing and spinning throughout. \"Clear Creek\" goes in yet another direction with piano and acoustic guitar (with background orchestration) painting a scene of peaceful respite and reflection. \"Untouched\" reminds me of the wonder of discovering places that have been \"untouched\" by civilization - wilderness areas, mountain vistas, remote beaches, etc. Piano, oboe, and orchestra give this piece a range from playful to awe-inspiring.  \"Disappearing Moon\" includes a bold piano part, mandolin (I think!), and full orchestra. The strummed instrument gives the piece a mysterious touch that I really like. \"Red Line\" is a piece Crane often plays in concert but that had not yet been recorded. One of the faster and bigger pieces, I would imagine that this is a real crowd pleaser live! \"Soli Dio Gloria\" is by far the longest track at just over five minutes, and feels emotional and personal, like telling about very moving chapter from ones life or giving heartfelt advice to someone close who is hurting - my favorite on this album. \"Archetype\" is very cinematic and visual with a big sweep and an infectious energy. I really like this one, too! \"Stratford Road\" brings the album to a peaceful and dreamy close with a piece that evokes nostalgia and longing - also a beauty!\n\nEven though this CD is relatively short at 33 minutes, these pieces are all full and complete. Anything more could spoil the mood. Recommended!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"What do you do when you're a band whose career has been built around telling a story that has reached its conclusion? Well, if you're Coheed and Cambria, you make a prequel. Taking place before the events of the band's 2002 debut,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Second-Stage-Turbine-Blade\/dp\/B000063NCW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Second Stage Turbine Blade<\/a>, \"Year of the Black Rainbow\" is a prologue to the \"Amory Wars,\" an intricate sci-fi\/love-story series cooked up by band mastermind Claudio Sanchez, as produced by Joe Barressi (Queens of the Stone Age, Clutch) and Atticus Ross (Nine Inch Nails, Korn) and featuring the recording debut of drummer Chris Pennie (formerly of Dillinger Escape Plan) who was forced to sit out the recording sessions of the band's previous effort,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/No-World-For-Tomorrow\/dp\/B000VI70W2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">No World For Tomorrow<\/a>.\n\nFans who felt \"No World for Tomorrow\" was merely more of the same may be pleased to find the band exploring new territory on their fifth album. While the material at hand lacks the epic scope of the band's classics, there is enough experimentation and showing off to compensate. Drummer Chris Pennie gets his chance to shine on \"Guns of Summer,\" perhaps the most intense and progressive tune on the album which finds the band treading in previously uncharted territory while proving Pennie's got nothing else to prove. Sanchez, on the other hand, seems to be evolving vocally. It's funny to listen to this album followed by \"The Second Stage Turbine Blade\" and hear how far he has come and how well his voice has matured.\n\nThe production job by Atticus Ross, who helped give Korn somewhat of an industrial make-over on their previous two albums, does essentially the same thing for Coheed & Cambria here (albeit with better results). Songs like \"Here We Are Juggernaut\" and \"Far\" very well could have been typical Coheed fare if not for their dense production which in turn makes for some awe-inspiring ear-candy. Find yourselves some good speakers or headphones and just marvel at how amazing it all sounds. Unfortunately, the latter half of the album finds the band slipping into auto-pilot at times, and while songs like \"World of Lines\" and \"In The Flame of Error\" are classic Coheed, the album caps off in a rather underwhelming way, which is a shame when you consider how strongly it starts.\n\nSure, \"Year of the Black Rainbow\" is the sort of album that is almost guaranteed to leave the purists displeased and, sure, they don't sound quite the same anymore, but isn't that what progression is all about? Even if you don't consider this album a success, they deserve credit for pushing themselves in different directions. In fact, the best moments on the album are the ones where the band steps out of their comfort zone, which leads one to believe that their next album - free from the constraints of plot consistency, among other things - will be all the more interesting. Listen to this one with an open mind.","classification":4,"fold":3}
{"text":"After a dozen years, I admit I expected more. This is respectable. The compositions are quite subtle and musically mature, but maybe because of that they lack the impact of something simple and direct like his Sweet Baby James. I don't hear any classics here, with the possible exception of Wild Mountain Thyme, which is nearly goosebump-inducing in beauty. Far Afghanistan is pretty trite, and it is a track for me to skip when I listen. I feel moderately affectionate about this album, and Taylor seems modestly engaged. Perhaps he needed someone like his old producer Peter Asher to kick things up a notch in the energy department, as Asher did for the recent Steve Martin\/Edie Brickell collaboration. This album is nothing if not pleasant, with gentle humor and some real emotion. But it's certainly a long way from the kick in the seat that starts out his album \"JT,\" namely Your Smiling Face. That album scaled the heights and the power of the quiet numbers was awesome as well. James has done too much stellar work in the past for me to be wholly satisfied with this new offering. If second-tier James Taylor is good enough for you, you'll like this collection of tunes.","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"Michael Dulin wears his heart on his musical sleeve on his most romantic and possibly most personal album to date, \"My Beloved.\"One of the most incredible pianists on the planet, Dulin's original music is graceful and elegant with his classical roots in clear evidence. Dulin began his musical career in the classical realm, competing at an international level. He started composing music in about 2003 and has become one of the most beloved and admired pianist\/composers in the contemporary instrumental music field. Dulins music usually falls into the new age category because it doesnt easily fit into any one genre. More classical than anything else, there are also strong jazz influences, but it is Dulins amazing technique coupled with his heart-tugging sensitivity and sophisticated touch that put him into a genre all his own. Something of a pianists pianist, who hasn't drooled over those magical fingers flying effortlessly over the piano keys, expressing anything and everything he chooses? On some of his previous releases, Dulin has used keyboards in addition to his Steinway, but this album is pure solo piano heaven!\n\n\"My Beloved\"  begins with Beloved, a sweet love song that begins with a simple but very tender melody that evolves into a breathtaking showcase for Dulins expressive (and very impressive!) playing. Devotion was composed as a way for Dulin to tell his wife that he loves her more than anything. Lyrical and graceful, it is not as complex as some of the pieces, but comes straight from the heart. Chanson is a slow, romantic waltz that accompanies a promise to dance together in Paris someday. Through The Night is a favorite. The gentle flow of the piece is deeply introspective and feels very free and in the moment. Walking Joy is light and carefree, played at an easy pace that is relaxed and happy. My Treasure is another favorite. More than a bit Chopin-esque, the simple melody flows effortlessly over the passionate underpinnings of the piece - gorgeous! As Long As Were Together conveys a strong sense of contentment and optimism without being sugar-coated. The regular pulse of the left hand contrasts with the free-flowing right, making this a fascinating piece on several levels. When I Think Of You is a magical love song that reminds me a bit of Liszt - so beautiful! Rhapsody ends the album on a playful note that always makes me smile - I cant wait to play this one!\n\nWith \"My Beloved,\" Michael Dulin proves once again that hes The Man when it comes to the piano! Let this wonderful music transport your heart to a world of love and devotion where all things are possible. Sure to be a Favorite for 2015, I give \"My Beloved\" my highest recommendation.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Super Sessions is a pretty unique album.  First of all I went into the album having very little experience with Mike Bloomfield despite numerous reviews convincing me of the genius and spectacular beauty of Bloomfield's guitar style.  Well guess what?  I DO love the mans style!  It takes a while to warm up to it however, and this is mainly because he plays at such an intense speed that there's hardly any time to catch your breath!  You need to hear it several times in a row to absorb and understand it!\n\nNow when I first heard \"Albert's Shuffle\" a thought occured to me... \"MOVE over Eric Clapton!\" because it sounds almost identical to some of Clapton's heavy blues stuff such as the live version of \"Have You Ever Loved a Woman?\" from his EC Was Here live album.  It definitely falls under the same category of emotionally resonant blues, but regardless who influenced who (though I think Clapton beat him to the punch but I could be wrong, hehe) this song is downright amazing.  Amazing how the guitar solos build through several layers of emotions and THEN to add more excitement, a keyboard solo makes an appearance around the halfway point, and it's a highly melodic keyboard solo at that.  It's an interesting change of pace going from emotional guitar solos to melodic keyboard work.  Perhaps the light touch of jazz after the keyboard solo is a bit much, but then again, this IS 1968 and considering this is what I believe the beginning of the classic years of rock, it's quite a performance.  There's definitely nothing lacking or incomplete about this album overall, that's for sure.  \"Really\" falls under the same category- emotional guitar playing, melodic keyboard solos, jazzy tendencies, etc.  Another high point.\n\nI absolutely LOVE \"His Holy Modal Majesty\".  In fact I actually first heard this song a few years ago on XM radio.  What caught my attention is the bass groove that can be heard during the first couple minutes, and... I had to do a google search to find THIS out, but the musical instrument jamming with the groove is something called an ondioline.  Don't even ASK me how to pronounce that, haha.  It's a high pitched instrument that's somewhere in between an early synthesizer and a keyboard.  Well whatever it is, it would probably irritate the pants off of me if it were to linger a few minutes longer BUT for just a couple minutes?  I can tolerate a couple minutes of a weird instrument!  Heck I can tolerate extreme pain for 2 minutes!  Well then again I've never been tortured.  Don't get any ideas!  :)\n\nAnyway, that bass groove is... WOW!  It makes \"His Holy Modal Majesty\" the best song on the album for me.  It reminds me of something kinky or rather, an Egyptian girl being kinky, hehe.  The rest of the song is occupied with fast-paced blues solos that are pretty melodic for the most part.\n\n\"Season of the Witch\" is the highlight for many people since it's the most familiar song here.  Well truth be told I never thought it was *that* great of a song- a slow-chugging, slightly ominous vocal melody that actually reminds me of Neil Young's \"Down By The River\" for some reason, and the jazziness we eventually experience is... eh, a bit much.  Not a bad song by any means, and this is by FAR the best version of it too.  11 minutes is just too much for my limited attention span I'm afraid!  Though it IS really melodic so at least it has that going for it.  \"Stop\" is based around really cool, melodic blues guitar and keyboard soloing.  Once again, the keyboard work strikes me as immediatley melodic whereas the guitar solos are a bit on the complex side so it takes time to search for the melodic lines.  It's awesome though.  \"Harvey's Tune\" is an atmospheric jazz instrumental.  I love it.\n\n\"Man's Temptation\" is a soulful tune with really beautiful and memorable vocals.  I love the creative inclusion of horns as well.  Yes there's hundreds of 60's songs that closely resemble this one in terms of atmosphere, arrangements and vocals but I don't care- I'll take them ALL!  \"You Don't Love Me\" is dominated with the ULTRA cool phase shifter effect.  You'll know what I mean when you hear it.  It sounds like you're in a spaceship and headed for Saturn!  I wonder if todays technology can recreate this particular sound?  I haven't heard this effect used in any music after the mid 70's.  It must have went out of style.  Anyway this is a blues\/hard rock song similar to Robin Trower's early work, and it's awesome.  \"It Takes a Lot To Laugh, It Takes a Train To Cry\" reminds me of the mid 60's Byrds with a fast-paced, psychedelic part-country style.  Those feel good vibes are in high quantity here as well.\n\nOverall, it's super duper Super Sessions!  Pick it up for a solid taste of Mike Bloomfield, Stephen Stills and Al Kooper (though for me Bloomfield CLEARLY steals the spotlight).","classification":5,"fold":3}

It has been over 20 years since Toni Braxton took on the music industry, and her success as a part of Laface records still has been a cornerstone of what great female R&B music is absolute;y like. Un-Break My Heart, is honestly one of Toni's masterpieces from the sensual Secrets record. The song is definitely one of those songs that blends beauty, voice and soulfulness all into one, which Diane Warren had beautifully wrote for her. The song is absolutely one of a kind, and still sounds much more beautiful every time I heart it. Something that acts like Rihanna, Mariah Carey and Beyonce' Knowles could take a real page on that female songstresses did like Toni back then. If you have never heard a Toni Braxton song before, this is really the one to go to first. I sincerely recommend it.\n\nSong: A+","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I took a listen to the samples posted for A Hero Will Rise. I liked what I heard but I had no idea that the songs were going to be so short. This album is very close in comparison with Two Steps From Hell Classics Vol. 1.\n\nIt's a very nice sound track, but there's nothing really memorable in each one. By the time you're getting any awesome visuals or feelings from the music, it ends! It'd be great to cut some of these tracks to movie trailers, but that's about it. It's not music that you will find yourself getting lost in, similar to the Classics Vol. 1 album.\n\nOverall, if you need filler epic music while driving or working on some dramatic piece. This soundtrack will do good by you.

{"text":"Having had, at one time, THE BEST OF PHOEBE SNOW vinyl LP, it was often played and had a limited lifetime.  My two favorite tracks were of course her magnum opus Poetry Man which gave her star status out of the starting gate with her first album; and secondly her fantastic take on The Beatles Don't Let Me Down.  I wanted these two replaced so badly, I purchased them as digital downloads for my phone music player as soon I saw the 2001 release of the VERY BEST OF CD which expands on the original by 6 more tracks.  Ms Snow's first and foremost talent is that four-octave bluesy contralto that was unique in the 70's and still is today (sadly she passed 6 years ago last month); then there is her unique finger play on \"lead\" acoustic guitar, a velvety touch with lilting grace that hammers at just the right accent spots for making her music style all her own.  Poetry Man is also a one-of-a-kind piece of musical art, it seems to occupy a space somewhere between jazz, folk, and the blues, a space where there seems to be no competition and was simply way ahead of its time.  The closest in musical style you can come to it is Dave Matthews' work, his own being an artistic spot where the three genre experiment with each other, close but not quite like Phoebe Snow.  Her Calypso inflected Beatles cover is also highly unique and Snow just owns it.  One of my favorite songs by my favorite artist, she took it from them and bent it slightly around the middle, making a blues rock composition into a Caribbean gospel folk ballad.  The Gospel Choir never overwhelms Snow's perfect-pitched delivery and her soft-scat coda.  If you download either of these two gems, and you seriously love them (how can you not?) then I urge you with all sincerity to grab hold of the VERY BEST OF PHOEBE SNOW CD.","classification":5,"fold":3}
{"text":"Fifteen good instrumental tracks, and five vocals that I can do without.\n\n I don't care for the androgynous male (?) singer on \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.\"\n\n He(?) appears again on \"Christmas Day,\" which is also uninspiring as a composition.\n\n \"Every Time it Snows\" is another mediocre song, and while Olivia Newton-John is good, she sings a duet with another wimpy voice.\n\n The medley of \"O Come, All Ye Faithful...\" etc. has an unexceptional female vocal, it would have been better as an instrumental.\n\n The worst is the female vocal of \"Silent Night.\" Of all hymns, IMHO this one ought to be sung reverently. Not \"sah-ha-lent naght, hoo-woo-lee naght...\" She puts a huge pause between \"yon virgin\" and \"mother\" which indicates that she doesn't have a clue about the actual meaning of the lyrics. I'm sure she's adequate for the nightclub where they found her, but IMHO she is the wrong person for this hymn.\n\nSo discard these 5 tracks, and you've got a great collection.

{"text":"Nu-metal was a big fad for me back in high school. However, most bands have passed on and have seperated from that sound. When you first look at Hollywood Undead, you may think Slipknot or Mushroomhead because of there masks. They sound like Bloodhound Gang, Eminem, and Beastie Boys mixed in a blender and thats a good thing. I got to see this band live on tour and I thought I was at a Miley Cryus concert when I lined up. The fans were mostly girls under 18 but this band did put on a hell of a show. I enjoy the opening track Undead, Everywhere I Go, Young, and A Bottle and Gun. The only problem with the band is they need more topics to sing besides partying and sex. Anther problem is i'm sick of white kids trying be to black and gangsters. I enjoy rap every now and then but I don't speak in ebonics or dress like them. I love this band but I don't think they will go far in music, despite a rabid fanbase. There sound is ten years too late, all songs are basically the same, and music goes in trends and I don't see nu-metal being hot anytime soon. Still, I highly recommend this cd to check out. Its catchy and the price is right. You'll get hooked on a few songs but no, Eminem is not singing. Its a guy named Charlie Scene.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"There always has been something that has been said about Michael Jackson, past and present. Musically, he had shown a lot of brilliance. But personally, Michael was suffering internally and that is why he passed away so young. Yet it was already 7 years since the King Of Pop passed away and shocked the world. When Michael Jackson did release his Invincible album in 2001, it fell not just in poor sales, but disgusted promotion from Sony, and Jackson wound up abruptly leaving the label on protest and indignity. But also the songs didn't strike outside of the R&B arena at the whole. Heaven Can Wait is one of those overlooked songs that could've been bigger from he soul Michael had shown at the song. At the time, Michael was trying to fit into both the N'Sync & Backstreet Boys era, which feel through the cracks. But the song has had more cult status posthumously, as is the case with Maxwell sampling Heaven Can Wait for his song 1990x, which is a better sampled song at the soul. This is a good buy for die hard Michael Jackson fans, but not a must overall.\n\nSong: C+","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"This follow up to the enormously successful Close To The Edge was fraught with conflicts and enormous inspirations.  Composed of lead singer Jon Anderson, guitarist Steve Howe, Bassist Chris Squire, multiple keyboardist Rick Wakeman and drummer Alan White and recorded in the countryside, it was intended to be a concept album.  Indeed, despite the varying degrees of accolades and dismissals, the album still did very well.  It was at least an opportunity for the five artists to explore and expand their talents at length over the course of the album.  All had great solo opportunities.\n\nNow re-released in this four CD package, it covers all the bases  more than I have seen in any other collection to date.  Thanks to Steve Wilson, there is a 5.1 surround sound  remaster of the entire album in three formats.  DTS is the most common\/popular and if any album was meant to showcase the talent in surround, this was one of them.  Its like being in the studio.  I love this album but going through a point-by-point analysis would prove nothing other than I love this album.  Instead, here are some of the goodies you get in this 2-CD collection.\n\nCD One  2016 Stereo Mixes\n\nCD Two  2016 Stereo Mixes and Alternate Album\n\nCD Three  Alternate Album and Single Edits\n\nBlu-ray Disc and DVD-Audio  2016 Stereo Mix (LPCM Stereo 24-bit\/96kHz)\n\nBlu-ray Disc and DVD-Audio  5.1 Surround Sound Mix (LPCM Stereo 24-bit\/96kHz and DTS-HD MA)\n\nBlu-ray Disc and DVD-Audio  Original Stereo Mix from Flat Transfer (LPCM Stereo 24-bit\/192kHz)\n\nBlu-ray Disc  Alternate Takes (LPCM Stereo 24-bit\/96kHz)\n\nBlu-ray Disc  2016 Stereo Singles Edits (LPCM Stereo 24-bit\/96kHz)\n\nBlu-ray Disc  2016 Stereo Instrumental Mixes (LPCM Stereo 24-bit\/96kHz)\n\nBlu-ray Disc  UK Vinyl Needle-Drop Transfer (LPCM Stereo 24-bit\/96kHz)\n\nBlu-ray Disc  US Banded Promo Vinyl Needle-Drop Transfer (LPCM Stereo 24-bit\/96kHz)\n\nAll the sleeves are black and there is a great liner note leaflet.  It contains information about about the various sources and the reasons behind them which is very helpful for audiophiles.  Sid Smith gives a lengthy expose on the album in generl and it provides some interesting insights.  The photos are there as well from that period.  At the beginning is a Definitive Edition Blu-ray Disc listing (like the one above).  Just the sheer quantity and quality on this set is fantastic.  I am glad its finally available.\n\nNOTE:  I am unable to transfer these songs (other than Blu-ray) to my iPhone.  Any help?","classification":5,"fold":3}

Other outstanding tracks include \"Every Good Thing\", the soothing mixture of synth and guitar on \"Like A River\", the funky flutes, synth, and guitar on \"Beautiful Day\", the arian-sounds of \"That's Life\", the oriental sound of \"Good Morning\" and the floating sax notes of \"Blue Pacific\".

But he also showed that he was able to do well with cover songs as well. That was the case with his cover of The Guess Who's American Woman, which was featured on a expanded version of his 5 album. The song feels just as driven today as when Lenny recorded it over a decade ago. While he hasn't reclaimed his 90's glory, Lenny still is making music out there. Hopefully, when his next work comes out, he can do another cover song like this one.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"There are some songs that really have withstood the test of time, because of their sincerity and the everlasting appeal that really have never gotten old time after time. With Joe Cocker, there are just so many cover songs that have been brilliant, as well as the classic songs that he had recorded throughout his lifetime. He had left 45 years of brilliant pop music that showed he had a unique and brilliant heart that really was worth listening to overall. Any song of his like With A Little Help From My Friends or the sentimental Up Where We Belong. But it also is the classic You Are So Beautiful, which definitely is a simple heart-wrencher that really gets you each and every time you listen to the song. This version which is on Joe Cocker's 2008 Classic Hits, highlighting Joe's Capitol records era is just as good, as you first heard it from the A&M era. It is honestly a definitive download that really ignites at your heart. I sincerely recommend you get this song.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Unlike other reviewers here, I am actually not an established fan of Brandon Flowers.  I never got into the Killers and as a result have never tried listening to Brandon Flowers's earlier solo material.  I actually discovered this stunner of an album when Bruce Hornsby mentioned at a recent concert that he had performed on some of its tracks.  Being a huge Bruce Hornsby fan, I was very interested to see what this was all about because the idea sounded so wonderfully incongruous.  I then read a very positive review of this album which name-checked a bunch of my favorite artists from my youth (U2, Peter Gabriel, Tom Petty) as influences, and decided to give it a shot.  Am I glad I did.\n\nI'm a middle-aged guy, probably not really the typical member of Brandon Flowers's fanbase.  As I mentioned above, I spent my formative years listening to artists like U2, Peter Gabriel, Dire Straits, The Cure and Tom Petty.  Perhaps that is why this music sounded so instantly familiar from the first listen.  Brandon Flowers wears his influences on his sleeve here.  The thing is, he somehow turns it all into a sound that is uniquely his own.  Sure, had he not heard all the music from the 80s, this collection of sounds probably wouldn't exist.  But what Flowers does is use the raw materials provided by the history of big pop-rock to channel his own muse and create some very compelling songs.  I hear a lot of Peter Gabriel's huge worldbeat sound here (on virtually all tracks with backup singers) as well as bits of late-70s\/early-80s Bowie (\"Still Want You\"), Actung Baby era U2 (virtually all tracks), Dire Straits (\"Diggin' Up The Heart\"), Bruce Springsteen (\"Dreams Come True,\" \"Untangled Love,\" \"The Way It's Always Been\"), and others which will probably hit me on future listens.  But never does the music sound anything less than fresh and playful, not weighted down by all the influences so much as lifted up by them.  It's simply the next step in the evolution of this loose genre.  And yes, Bruce Hornsby is all over this set of songs!  The musicianship here is uniformly excellent.\n\nI recommend this album not just for younger people but also for anyone who grew up with the rock of the 80s like I did.  It's a collection I will be listening to years from now, and one of the few new albums I have heard in the past five years that has absolutely knocked my socks off.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"After a few albums of searching for a sound, Newman experimented and finally found his sound on \"Sail Away\". He experimented so much, in fact, that \"Randy Newman Live\" was released as a stopgap in 1971;it also previewed 2 songs from this album in stripped-down piano-only versions. The \"alternate\" take of the title track on this reissue shows just how much Newman experimented. Pounding anthemic rhythyms gave way to more lush but not overstated arrangements. The final release was very much worth the wait. Newman brings orchestra back into the fray after completely abandoning it on \"12 Songs\" (most likely the abandonment came as a result of the use - and sometimes abuse - of orchestra on his debut album). Newman's piano and the orchestra meld wonderfully in the mix. Some of the arrangements are downright amazing (especially on the title track and \"He Gives Us All His Love\"). Thematically the album could not be more diverse: God, death, politics, satire at a Swiftian level, sex, and success. Newman's ability to communicate cynical satire in a way that takes itself seriously without seeming self-righteous is displayed all over this album. When he's funny he's also profound. \"God's Song\" is hilarious while at the same time chilling. The same could be said for the sadly still all too relevant \"Political Science\". In the midst of these songs, the serious numbers are almost shocking. There probably hasn't been a more candid song about death and belief than \"Old Man\". Newman claims that audiences have walked out on this one, so he's stopped playing it. It's a great song, but yes, an absolute downer. \"Dayton, Ohio - 1903\" evokes the era the song is set in complete with breeze and front porch swing. \"Memo to My Son\" is an absolutely hilarious song about parenting; the character in the song promises to show his son how smart he is, and then rattles off clich after clich. \"You Can Leave Your Hat On\" has become a very recognizable song, maybe one of Newman's best known songs (even for people who have no idea who Randy Newman is).\nThe bonus tracks on the reissue are interesting: \"Let It Shine\" is an upbeat and happy song more akin to Newman's movie soundtracks of late. It was written for a sitcom that apparently never aired, which explains the mood. \"Maybe I'm Doing it Wrong\" was included on \"Randy Newman Live\"; this is the studio version complete with orchestration. The rest are demos of songs on \"Sail Away\". All are good tracks that complement the album well.\nIt's no surprise that this album is considered a classic by many critics. It's one of Newman's best, and one of his best-sellers. A good album to introduce someone to Newman's music. It was the first Newman album I heard, and I've been a voracious fan ever since.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"This release grew out of last years unexpectedly successful Renaissance Choral Music box, and our yearly Big Baroque Box. We moved further in time to the Baroque period - but we discovered that if we did a Big Baroque Choral Music Box, it would, generously put, be about 75 hours long (no exaggeration). But it is named as a follow up to the Renaissance Choral Box, so we can move into Volumes 3 and beyond (and we will). So we cut out for the time being Bach, Handel and Purcell, all composers who we have covered with their own individual boxes. And we still left out quite a bit.\n\nWhy did we leave hours and hours of recordings off of this box? Well, for this box, we wanted to focus on Bach Guild recordings that had been buried in the vault for a while. The two juicy nuggets in this box are a long-forgotten recording of Israel in Egypt - one of the first Bach Guild releases (BG 521 to save you the trip to your LP collection). Sung in German, this is a rare bit, and The Bach Guilds first recording of a Handel oratorio. The second juicy bit is a complete recording of Glucks Orfeo and Euridice, made in Vienna (one of the last Vanguard recordings made in Vienna) in the mid 1960s, with a superb cast and conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras (BG 686, stereo version BGS 70686). This was released on CD in the early 1990s but has been out of print for (we estimate) nearly 20 years.\n\nAlso getting their Bach Guild digital debuts are the wonderful recording of the Kraus Funeral Cantata for Gustav, the Charpentier Te Deum with Jean-Francois Paillard (with Maurice Andre playing trumpet in the famous opening movement) and several other Baroque choral and vocal works featuring Alfred Deller, Maureen Forrester and other well-beloved members of the Bach Guild roster.\n\nKudos to the executive producer of The Bach Guild for tireless work resurrecting the Vivaldi Dixit Dominus RV 594. We often have just bare threads of information on the older recordings, and hunting down the old LP (and this is the 11th LP The Bach Guild released) can be very difficult, although we do have an extensive library, we don't have everything. The information was sketchy and misleading, and we tried to include this recording in the Big Vivaldi Box but we really couldn't piece the work together. This time, we were able to locate a score and place the tracks in the proper order (the information we had actually indicates that this was a different Vivaldi Dixit (there are two). So this recording, probably out of print for 50 years is now featured, in all its glory. We cant confirm this, but this release probably represented the first complete recording of the RV 594. We put the release date as 1952 (original LP number: BG 678, in stereo as BG 70678 - we only had the mono master at our disposal).\n\nAnd snark aside, we meant glory as in loud and glorious. This collection does not feature any historically informed instrument-based performances. You will hear full-throated choirs, and the Vivaldi never gets performed like this in our era, so its a surprise and surprisingly beautiful to hear an operatic choir throw themselves into this work now essentially in the possession of much smaller early music groups (not that theres anything wrong with that, either way).\n\nAgain, theres a lot more we could have put inbut we tend to cap these at 10-12 hours (yikes). This one is 8 hours and 54 minutes. Thanks to all who contacted us for all the suggestions for repertoire in the past year.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I'm an Alan Jackson fan and first heard the music from this CD on a TV special.  The song takes me back to my childhood when little girls were dressed for church on Sundays in dresses, black patent leather shoes with white lace anklets.  Little boys were in white shirts with ties and a jacket or a sweater, slacks and shoes were polished with their hair neatly combed.\n\nMy daddy not being a church going man except for the major holiday's, Easter, Mother's Day and Christmas, would go with mom, me and my 2 other siblings on Easter.  I remember listening to him sing along with this song and as I looked up at him I thought he had the best voice.  While he's now in his 80's and still not a church going man, it's one of my \"Precious Memories\".\n\nIt's not surprising that I purchased this song for my iPod to listen, along with several of the other old hymns offered on this CD.  I listen to them on my commute in the morning since I use public transportation and it helps to remind me of what really matters in life.\n\nAlan's deep voice resonates with a richness and respect that is missing in much of today's contemporary Christian music.  I can close my eyes and see the cross that I've held onto during the rough times and still hear my daddy's voice every Easter.\n\nIf you purchase one CD for your collection, make it this one.  It spans all ages and it's message rings true.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I'm sure there are Dixie Chicks fans out there who are thinking that an album without Natalie Maines just isn't going to be that great, they would be wrong. Sisters Martie Maguire and Emily Robison's first album as the Court Yard Hounds is perhaps a little more laid back than a Dixie Chicks album, but it's just as good. Up to now the girls have been providing vocal harmony for Natalie, this time around they are singing lead. Emily sounds more than a little like Sheryl Crow. The songs are't that much different than what you'd hear on a Dixie Chicks album since the Chicks wrote much of their material anyhow. In fact several of the songs would not be at all out of place on a DC album. If you're a fan of the Chicks, I think you'll like the Hounds as well. If you're one of those still hung up on an off the cuff comment made nearly a decade ago I think it's time to move on and give the Hounds a listen, you'll be pleasently surprised.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"If you don't like drive-thru records or TSL, why do you feel you're qualified to rate this record? I swear i'll never understand why people feel the need to trash on something simply becuase they don't like it.\n\nDespite what you'll hear from these retards below me, TSL's \"say it like you mean it\" is legendary, marking one of the last good DTR releases, before they went downhill. Each one of the record's 13 songs are amazing, and no two sound similar in the least. High production value and good mixing only add to this records greatness, and you'll probably have it in your cd for more than a couple weeks before moving on to something else.\n\nStandouts would have to include the infectious \"up and go\", the first single \"best of me\", the punk rocker \"hello houston\" and the somber acoustic ballad \"the drama summer\". Other noteworthy tracks include: \"the leaving song\" and \"left coast envy\". Pretty much any fan of pop-rock in general can find something to appreciate on \"say it\", and because replay value is so high, you find that the songs that just didn't stick before get better and better with time\n\nTSL has since released a load of crap called \"based on a true story\". This record is nothing like \"say it\", and if you're only going to buy one TSL record, make it \"say it like you mean it\". I seriously hope these guys can come out of their slump and put out an amazing third release.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"\"Don't call it a comeback\". That was back in '91, but those words still stand true today. Raekwon is back but did he really ever go anywhere? He was featured on Ghostface Killah's \"The Pretty Toney Album\" & \"Fishscale\". He was all over Wu Tang's last 2 CD's. He guest starred on songs by The Game, Busta Rhymes & Jadakiss. He has not disappeared, but with no major label releases in the last 6 years and 14 years removed from a classic, his name has been an afterthought in hip hop.\n\nThe buzz around \"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...Part  II\" surfaced 3 years ago. The problem was Rae had trouble finding a label and distribution. With this album, he will not have that problem anymore. \"...Cuban Linx Part II\" picks up right where the first one left off with Poppa Wu doing the monologue on \"Return of the North Star\". Icewater flips a sample of the movie \"The Godfather 2\" on \"Cold Outside\", where Rae and Ghost go into their classic storytelling flow. \"Ason Jones\" is dedicated to fallen Wu member ODB.  Method Man does the hook on \"New Wu\" which sounds alot like \"Ice Cream\". Near the end, OB4CL2 loses a little edge. \"Have Mercy\" ft Beanie Sigel does not fit with the vibe of the album. \"Catalina\" ft Lyfe Jennings & \"We Will Rob You\" ft Slick Rick just aren't as good as the rest of the album. But the album ends on a high note with \"Kiss The Ring\" ft. Inspector Deck & Masta Killa. This album is a perfect sequel to a classic. Though it will never be better than the original, it holds its own against anything put out in the last 5 years.\n\nThe production on this album is top notch. Of course there's RZA, GZA and Allah Mathematics, but old school producers like Pete Rock, Marley Marl & Eric Sermon also contributed. Dr. Dre lent a hand on a couple tracks. Newcomers like BT, Icewater and Scram Jones impressed me. And I don't know how he does it, but J-Dilla has 3 tracks. It amazes me how he still produces 3 years after his death.\n\nWu Tang Clan has been a force in hip hop since 1993. Each member has brought their own style to the masses. After ODB died and Meth disappeared, Wu looked like a fallen empire with only a couple survivors left waving the flag. Ghost held the fort down for years, but Wu Tang has been on life support since 2004. With this CD, Rae has single handedly resurrected the Clan. And with new albums from Ghost and Meth dropping later this year, it doesn't seem like they going away anytime soon.  Long live the Wu.","classification":4,"fold":3}

For instance, back in the '80s, Metallica was known for pounding, crushing, headbanging METAL, and now they're known for ripping fans off and liking money. It's a sad state of affairs.\n\nBut I digress. \"Ride The Lightning\" is easily one of the most awesome, headbanging, and skilled metal albums ever recorded. It rightfully earns its place in every metalhead's favorite album list. Insane drumming, loud riffs, blistering solos, and actual melody worked into the mix... once again, THIS is Metallica! From the intense, apocolyptic opener \"Fight Fire With Fire\", to the epic \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\", the beautifully written semi-ballad \"Fade To Black\", and, of course, the metal classic \"Creeping Death\", this album grabs a hold of the listener, and never lets go throughout the whole album!\n\nAnyway, yeah, this one's a classic.

I have to say i came away very happy with my purchase. Very good uptempo tracks and slower songs do have his classic vibe to them.\n\nThe thing I did not like the most is the order of the tracklisting. It did not seem to have a gradual tempo it was more like morning traffic with(speed up then slow down and speed up again). That aspect really made it hard to judge the album because I lost track with where he was going with it.

{"text":"Queensryche were really on a hard task with this album. They created a fine meisterwork in Operation Mindcrime that prog metal, hair metal and generic hard rock fans loved and then followed it up with the totally different Empire, an album that spawned a ballad that was a huge hit in the US and helped the album shift even more units than Mindcrime.\n\nSo what could they do after that? Well unlike the difference between Mindcrime and Empire which really was somewhat of a reinvention, the difference betwixt Empire and Promised Land isn't so drastic. In fact it seems to sit somewhere in the middle and actually is a lighter album than either of it's two predecessors.\n\nThe album starts off with an interesting little intro track and then seques into I Am I and Damaged, two straight ahead hard rockers. The fourth track, Out of Mind, is almost a repeat of Silent Lucidity in terms of it's mellow execution married to an off centre concept and haunting vocal lines by Tate. Things get even more Freudian during Bridge wihch deals with issues between fathers and sons.\n\nAs the album progresses the tracks get less and less special though Disconnected is an interesting direction for the band. Much of side two - in the old money - is very desultory and mellow. Not sure if the band wanted to be taken more seriously as generic musicians rather than hard rock knuckleheads or if this is really the album that was on their minds at the time.\n\nAll the production values are as you'd expect and overall this is a good album though not a great one. The newcomer to Queensryche should perhaps wrap their ears around Empire first and if they like that then try this on for size. More metal minded people would be better serviced by grabbing one of the Mindcrimes or their quite early discs.","classification":3,"fold":3}

Touches of some of Emmylou's past with the likes of Daniel Lanois and Malcom Burns spring to mind but this is so personal, intimate filled with such tender breathless gems. An artist approaching her mid 60's(that's been around the musical block) really isn't suppose to be so full of creativity, come on, but just\nlisten to all this, its so raw, real and full of life. There's mesmermising music all over here,\ntake your pick.

Particularly between male and female R&B artists like Rick James and Teena Marie, Donny Hathaway and Roberta Flack, and Cherrelle and Alexander O'Neal. Now I can add Alicia Keys and Maxwell to the list. Alicia's breathy contralto and Maxwell's trademark falsetto slow dance over a shuffling Prince-like backdrop replete with muted horns that's hypnotically languid without bordering into dull\/repetitive territory. Both singers exhibit the very chemistry they croon about \"getting hotter and hotter\".

Purple Rain is a very layered song that brings on layers of emotions. Between the instrumental genius to the lyrics and just the way that Price uses his voice as an instrument is sheer artistic genius. In a day and age where music is mostly technology, I like to turn back to the musicians who used raw talent to create these kind of masterpieces. This song is ageless. It never sounds dated.

After listening to Fireflights full body of work from Healing of Harm to Now, I can say that they are showing growth and maturity but are playing it a little to safe for my tastes.  They won't disappoint their longtime fans and they may pick up a few more, but until they try to reach beyond their comfort zone.","classification":4,"fold":3}

As a reigning teen idol Bobby's face was plastered all over the teen magazines and his records were selling like hotcakes. Then in 1964 the phenomenon known as the British Invasion caught everyone by surprise and suddenly stars like Bobby Rydell, Gene Pitney, Roy Orbison and so many others were cast aside. Times had changed and youngsters in the mid sixties were movin' and groovin' to new and different sounds. At about that same time Bobby learned that his longtime record label Cameo-Parkway had been sold and was moving its operations out of his native Philadelphia. His last big hit record for Cameo was 1963's \"Forget Him\" which peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sadly, Bobby Rydell would never have another hit record again.","classification":5,"fold":3}

Josh brings out more of his personal side in this album. The songs on this album are so beautiful, and, as I've read, many of them were done in one take, that's amazing and it still sounded incredible. I've been a fan of Josh Groban's for the past 8 years now. I've heard pretty much all of his repertoire and the voice that comes out of that man still is unreal to me, even after all these years. I admire his higher register and his lower register; his range is beyond belief now. Kudos Josh for yet another \"Illuminating\" album. Keep the great music coming!","classification":5,"fold":3}

Easton's vocal similarity to George Strait is unmistakable, but he gives us a lot more range than the texas two-steps which define George (and which he rules!).  Don't judge the album by the hit single alone: I love the message in \"lovin you is fun\" but it's not his best track ... this album has alot more to offer.  Title track is probably my favorite.\nThe mood here is easy, simple feel good country without the drama or pretending to be anything it's not.

But nevertheless, they have been known for so many great songs that are just as strong today as they were back in the 80's. Faithfully, when it came out originally from their record Frontiers in 1983, still is just a beautiful classic. It is simply one of those songs standing tall in simplicity that will never die. Just like Open Arms or Send Her My Love, it really is a excellent song that is a pleasure to listen too. It is definitely a great song worth checking out if you have not even heard a Journey song yet.

She delivers and does it with 110% on `Growing Pains'.\nAs with everything thing May J. Blige does she puts every ounce of emotion and rawness into every song on this set.  Every song on here is a stand out that it's hard to single out any song. There is everything from classic slow Mary jams to the upbeat dance tracks to songs with a rock twinge fused into them.\n\nMy favorites on here include:\n\"Work That\" which has a great beat to it and promotes a good motto - to be yourself!\n\"Roses\" is THE cut!!  WOW!  Great melody, great lyrics and amazing vocals!\n\"Work In Progress (Growing Pains\" is a song that we can all relate to. Very good\n\nI think the biggest appeal of MJB is that she is very relatable. She sings from the heart and it feels like every song was written for us; the listeners. She is your neighbor, your friend, your sister. Mary deserves every bit of success she gets and this CD is living proof of that! Amazing!!\n\n~~~JAC  07'","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"\"Born In The U.S.A.\" is the lead track off of Bruce Springsteen's 1984 album of the same name.  The song is a look at a Vietnam vet who returns home to find that his country has forgotten all about him.  The song's dark lyrics are masked by a stirring, anthemic backing track that embodied a patriotic sound that caused confusion over the real meaning of the song.  All the misunderstanding aside, the song is both pro and anti America.  It takes on the yin and yang that is this country by on one hand, celebrating the majestic and glory of the flag and then the dark underbelly where we send the less fortunate to keep them out of sight.  It is a perfect song and one of, if not, the greatest single of all time.","classification":5,"fold":3}

First in 2003, we get the Number Ones album, then in 2004 we get the Ultimate Box Set Edition,& now this. Don't get me wrong, I love Michael Jackson but why no new material on this album. The first Disc starts off great, the only missing from that one is songs like the Jackson 5's I'll Be There,Lovely One,Heartbreak Hotel,Never Can Say Goodbye and a few more. But that is why they released the Essential Jacksons. Disc 1 continues into all the \"Off The Wall\" & \"Thriller\" classics. Starting on Disc 2, it goes into all the \"Bad\" singles..the only one that was missing is \"Liberian Girl\" which was a single in the U.K., All the singles from \"Dangerous\" are here besides \"Jam\". I am not sure why the title cut \"Dangerous\" included. That should of been where \"Jam\" should of been. Also the final single from the \"Dangerous\" album is not included \"Gone Too Soon\". Now it starts to slip a little. We only get 1 song \"History\" & One song from \"Invincible\"? No No!! Where is Scream, They Don't Care About Us, Stranger In Moscow,Earth Song & Childhood? From Invincible, where is Cry & Butterflies? and also his 2003 hit single \"One More Chance\"? All of these titles are missing.

{"text":"Not only is Hiroshima the place of residence for Takashi Suzuki as well as the site of a notorious historic event, but it also the creative impetus for Suzuki's latest work, resulting in an album that is among the highest order of synthesizer music.\n\nNeither Hiroshima itself nor its implications are the focus of the CD. Rather, Suzuki uses Hiroshima as a jumping-off point to explore the journey of an imagined soul after the end of its corporeal life in a real catastrophe. Suzuki has basically created the soundtrack for that conceit.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is!\n\nAll the sounds on the disc are generated entirely by Suzuki's synthesizers, which is easy to forget because this is as far from sounding like electronic music as you can get. In fact, the music is very orchestral, but in a more solemn, heartfelt--rather than full-bore, bombastic---manner. Think searching, penetrating horns and strings.\n\nAlso telling is the fact that this is Suzuki's first international CD release to feature tracks with separate, distinct titles, furthering the effect of a story with a unique theme unfolding.\n\nThis is a bold musical statement from a visionary, continually evolving artist.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Queensryche comes back with their sophomore album with lead singer Todd LaTorre much to the liking of QR fans.  I think behind the scenes the drama between Tate and QR continues with fans.  Some fans will love this album while others will just hate it.  That's just the way it is when lead singers leave a group that they really made an impact on.  I prefer to leave it behind as Tate is doing his thing now (whether you love that or not is besides the point) and QR is doing their thing.  For those wishing a return to Operation Mindcrime \/ Empire days you're probably not going to get that here.  Overall, this is a solid album with enough on it to please fans of QR.  It's a great hard rock album and really not sure if you could call it a progressive album.  I think the most telling is LaTorre's voice and his ability to deliver more in the QR vein than Tate could for the past 15 years or so, unfortunately.  But, the debate goes on and on and on, much like it does with Yes fans and whoever happens to be the current replacement for Jon Anderson at any given moment these days.  At this point, I think any fan needs to put aside preconceived notions of what QR will sound like going forward and just accept the fact that QR has moved on without Tate.  As LaTorre gels with the group hopefully that propels them to continue to deliver quality albums.  As much as LaTorre sounds somewhat like Tate he still has the ability to distinguish himself as his own.  Put aside the stigma of the lead singer as countless groups over decades have changed lead singers and have actually achieved much greater success with a new lead singer, sometimes much to the chagrin of their fans.  So, maybe here QR will do the same.  Great effort by the band and not rushing the album, but instead releasing what they wanted to release and when they wanted to release it.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Remember extended LPs, those records you'd buy which had one song you liked? Remember how you convinced yourself it was OK to buy it, even though you didn't like the rest of the album? It was OK then, and it is OK now. \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,\" the album, has five songs you never heard of, and one song you should know. This song is the one you want. Skip the album.\n\nIn the rock-and-roll canon, that great list of songs everyone generally agrees is great, you'll find a few Elvis, Stones and Beatles tunes. Zeppelin will have their share, and you'll see the Doors, Clapton, Buddy Holly and other familiar names repeated throughout that list. Then, somewhere close to #100 or 150, you'll see 'Iron Butterfly'. Who? It doesn't matter who. It matters what. The what is \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,\" a 17 minute work of rock-n-roll art.\n\nTo say Iron Butterfly was a one-hit wonder is only relating half of the story. This wasn't like \"People!\" whose cover of \"I Love You,\" hit high and then was forgotten when band members split to do other things. That's a real one-hit wonder. Iron Butterfly had one hit, but it would be like if Zeppelin only gave the world \"Stairway to Heaven.\" The one song is enough to seal them in rock-n-roll history.\n\nHas anyone covered this song? No one cares, because this is the version everyone wants. Everyone else is just giving this version an homage.\n\nLike Skynard's guitar in \"Freebird,\" the drum solo here is what everyone talks about. The physical endurance to carry it off, and the musical strength to sustain the rhythm back into the song is amazing.\n\nI fully recommend, \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,\" by Iron Butterfly.\n\nAnthony Trendl\nanthonytrendl.com","classification":5,"fold":3}

A cigarette, a cup of coffee, maybe some fries with brown gravy, and \"She's Got You.\" It's something you can't recreate.\nAnd what a voice.

{"text":"The first time I listened to this disc the time flew by!  It was very good.  They took a little edge off the guitar licks, a lot of edge off the vocal anger and melded in some very consistent and pleasing melodies.  The album still qualifies as a rock recording, but I think it will appeal to a more mainstream audience than their previous album.\nKroeger's lyrics are again stunning.  He has a great voice that's just rugged enough to deliver the song's message - damn, I wish I had his voice.\nI was a little disappointed that \"Hero\" from the Spiderman soundtrack wasn't included.  Afterall it was a Nickelback collaboration and would have rounded this disc out nicely.  The limited edition casing is cool, done with a tri-fold cardboard sleeve with nicely done liner notes.\nThe songs on here won't chart like the songs from \"Silver Side Up\", but it's still worth the money you'll spend.","classification":4,"fold":3}

Beyonce, with her gorgeous voice and fantastic vocals, reiterates that if her ex had liked her so very much then he should have been willing to make a commitment at the time, rather than shopping around for the best 'deal' - and that reacting childishly when he realizes that another man wants what he discarded is ridiculous. I particularly like how the song stresses that this is not about the new man - there will be no fight to 'win' the lady back, because she's not a prize for two men to fight over. This is between her, and her ex, and she is telling him that he didn't want to commit, he wanted to shop around, so he should now sleep in the bed he made.

Female singers have became more like they are products than people. for singers, like Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna have really missed the mark when it came down to voice.

I Didn't Know My Own Strength is one of my favorite tracks from I Look To You. When I first heard the song, I was sincerely brought to tears, as the last notes that Diane Warren wrote specifically for Ms. Houston, we were all dealing with the passing of Farrah Fawcett, Ed McMahon and Michael Jackson all on the same week in June of 2009. The song was not only beautiful first hearing it, but definitely one Whitney's finest during her lifetime. While people don't think of this song as much as I Will Always Love You, it is a song I  sincerely recommend listening to from the deepest soul of \"The Voice's\" Heart.

Some of the pictures are close up (like flowers) and you don't know what you are looking at until the editor zooms the picture out a bit. That made this a bit mysterious at times.\n\nWhat you will find is relaxing scenes in nature (lakes and forests), flowers, dolphins (lots), giraffes, cats, butterflies, seagulls, dogs, seals, exotic orchids, horses, deer, people walking on a beach, roses, teddy bears and more.\n\nI'd suggest this for married women with children as themes of childcare and love of a husband are prominent in some songs.\n\nWhile the songs are non religious the dedication is to many religions. So I'd say the artist is possibly New Age. Her song \"Save the World\" does however not say how we can save the world but just repeats the words \"save the world\" over and over again.

{"text":"Barbra Streisand's new album \"Partners\" finds her pairing with male superstars from Billy Joel, Lionel Richie, to Blake Shelton and Andrea Bocelli on covers of her songs and standards. Co-produced by Babyface (who sings with her on \"Evergreen\" as well as the lovely horn-sprinkled \"Lost Inside Of You\" - the latter on the deluxe edition), the album finds Streisand in fine form, even if she's not as fiery as when these were originally recorded.\n\nThe big band Jazzy \"It Had To Be You\" opens the collection, a vibrant duet with Michael Bubl. A youthful-sounding Stevie Wonder duets and plays harmonica on the enchanting \"People\" (with a Bossa Nova lilt), while John Mayer lends his voice and Bluesy guitar to \"Come Rain Or Come Shine\".\n\nOther standouts include the grandiose \"I Still Can See Your Face\" with Andrea Bocelli (this has got to be the standout vocal performance), \"How Deep Is The Ocean\" with her son Jason Gould whom she gives room to shine (and he sounds almost as good as his mother, a bit like George Michael), \"What Kind Of Fool\" with John Legend's soulful croon against an elegiac string\/piano backdrop after an ornate orchestral overture, a theatrical \"Somewhere\" with Josh Groban, and a reverent \"Love Me Tender\" with Elvis and delicate guitars. I have to confess, I found \"The Way We Were\" with Lionel Richie disappointing. This is one of my favourite Streisand songs, but the arrangement falls flat and Richie seems intimidated vocally.\n\n\"I've Got A Crush On You\" with Frank Sinatra appears on the deluxe, as well as \"I Finally Found Someone\" with Bryan Adams, \"I Won't Be The One To Let Go\" with Barry Manilow, and \"Guilty\" with Barry Gibb, all previously released. The soft musical arrangements range from Jazzy to Blues to Classical, and her phrasing is impeccable as ever. It is nice to hear lush strings, real percussion, guitars, and great voices, a welcome respite from the clatter on the charts. Barbra is the real deal. Here's hoping this gives her the 10th #1 album of her career.","classification":4,"fold":3}

But he really took his music into a 180 degree turn, and turned that magic, and made a wasted time in his work with Blurred Lines, the lead single with T.I. and Pharrell from his upcoming Blurred Lines really doesn't ignite. In fact, it makes him less of a sex symbol with his songs, and turns into a silly noise. I really didn't like the song at all. It definitely feels like the weakest thing he has ever recorded in his decade-long career in music. I hope he never records something like this ever again.

{"text":"Right from the first riff on the first track (California Kids) you can tell Weezer has changed a little as they've gotten older. But that's totally cool because so have I! They are still distinctively Weezer with that unique sound they bring. But they take a few different turns on this album to try some new things. Most of them work really well. I absolutely loved 6 tracks on this album. I really enjoyed 2 more. Only 1 was just okay and only 1 was a completely miss for me.\n\n California Kids - This became one of those \"You can't help buy sign along with it\" songs before I was even through listening to it the first time. You know, kind of like Buddy Holly was. (The Weezer song, not the actual Buddy Holly...who also made me want to sign along)\n\n Wind In Our Sail - Has a GREAT background beat and sound. From the second the song started my head was boppin' and enjoying this track. AS the lyrics started I got to liking it even more. The lyrics are awesome. It's all about a positive attitude but it's set to words about sailing and sailing weather and stuff like that. Think about how the band Cake signs every other song in terms about cars...it's like that. Only with boats. It reminded me of a cross between Cake's love of cars, Weezer's sound, and They Might Be Giants' Here Comes Science album.\n\n Thank God For Girls - Has a slightly different sound as it starts off with more vocals than instruments. It's a different route for Weezer and they work it. Once the instruments kick in it still ahs a somewhat different sound, more Nirvana-ish. It works. I like it. And the lyrics are certainly anything most guys can relate to.\n\n Good Thing - Has kind of a Beach Boys Christmas album sound. I don't know how else to describe it. There are jingle bells in the back ground. It's 3:25 of catchy awesomeness. And I don't know how you work the phrase \"Stockholm Syndrome\" into song lyrics and make it work, but Weezer finds a way.\n\n Do You Wanna Get High - This was probably the least acoustically appealing song on the album. But I liked the message. It was kind of a sarcastic view on drug use. They talk about using drugs like they are great, but are actually describing a disaster of a life. The chorus includes \"Do you wanna get high, don't need no dinner tonight\" That kind of says it all, about how drugs just consume you and become all you are about. At least that's what I got out of it. This one is probably up to interpretation.\n\n King Of The World - I though this song missed the mark. I didn't hate it. It's got a neat sound. But the lyrics kind of lost me. This desperately felt like a \"Guys, we really need a 10th track for this album. What have we got laying around?\" song.\n\n Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori - This gets the album back on track. It's a little slower than Weezer typically gets but it works. It's not as easy to sing along with, but it's hard not to dance to.\n\n LA Girlz - This one sounds like old school classic Weezer. The sound reminded me of Susanne, one of their all time classics. If you liked Weezer back in the day, this track will feel like home.\n\n Jacked Up - They put a lot more piano in this track than you are used to hearing from Weezer. The whole song has a different feel that's not as Weezery as you are used to. (Okay, I just wanted to use the word Weezery in a sentence.) It sounds more poppy. It's cool though. Not my favorite but I liked it.\n\n Endless Bummer - Talk about a different sound. This one gets going with harmonic vocals against an acoustic guitar background. It's like a modern day 1950's song. I LOVED this track. It's the perfect end for the album.\n\nThen I was kinda sad it was over.....so I listened to it again!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"This is Metallica's second album Ride The Lighting which was released in 1984. Although it's not as good as Master Of Puppets, but it's still a classic gem. Picking up where their debut album Kill'Em ALL left off, Ride The Lightning has better production. The opening track Fight Fire With Fire starts off with a little accoustic intro, and suddenly warps into thrashing speed and will have you headbanging throughout. The title cut is another menacing headbanging track as well. For Whom The Bell Tolls and the awesome thrash ballad Fade To Black are two of the band's most popular songs. Creeping Death is another great song, and of course the closing track The Call Of Ktulu is an epic instrumental. James Hetfield's vocals are good, and his rhythm guitarwork is good as well. Kirk Hammet's lead guitarwork is splendid. Cliff Burton's bass lines are very menacing, and Lars Ulrich's drumming is good as well. Anyways, this is a great album and should be a part of your collection. Buy it now! R.I.P Cliff Burton\n\nthemetalbeast's ratings:\n\n1. Fight Fire With Fire: 5\/5\n\n2.

{"text":"Having been onto Keyshia before her debut broke through selling 90k in its opening week, I have chosen to buy each subsequent album. \"Just Like You\" signaled a new kind of soul coming from the San Francisco\/Oakland Bay Area and to date is her most satisfying album. That is not to say \"A Different Me\" did not hold its own, it certainly did. Was \"Calling All Hearts\" a disappointment? Wouldn't say that either though the wrong single choices my have impeded its ultimate chance of success.\n\nI still bought \"Woman to Woman\" without the benefit of hearing enough snippets. I have learned not to judge a project solely on its first single. I do like \"Enough of No Love\" especially the line \"had me thinking 'bout calling that bitch last night and tell her where she could meet me\". And her stylings in the video are fascinating....funny on one hand, oddly eye-catching with the hair and the dress and the starry decored boot shoes. It is also that punk emo soul that is a dimension Keyshia seems to work well with her Oaktown roots. When the song hits a major then minor key that reveals remnants of a San Francisco Bay Area homegirl. The San Francisco sound that prevailed in the 70s is a certain emotive experience best captured by a stroke of Carlos' sensual guitar or a piano riff from Rachmaninov. But as time has gone by, I find myself really enraptured by the first two singles and their accompanying video. If ever a song has grown on me, \"Enough of No Love\" is hypnotic. To think that those lyrics actually belonged to another track....because it seems so ideal. Benny Boom has created two creative videos. Keyshia is an interesting contrast. Without a doubt, she is hood. But her melodies are often pretty and fluid.\n\nNow that I have spent quality time with the album, \"Get it Right\" is the standout. The lyric, \"You don't stroke me like you use to\" is fully erotic and very vivid. I love the chorus. She worked with new writers and producers along with the marquee named writers\/producers. It seems like the new writers have the edge.\n\nFor an album with a plethora of writers and producers, it still has a consistency that makes it quite compelling a listen. Of all the tracks from initial listenings, \"Hey Sexy\", \"Stubborn\", \"Forever\", \"Trust and Believe\" and \"Who's Gonna Hold Me Down\" rise to the surface immediately. The Rodney Jerkins track nor The Dream produced tracks do not sound like anything they have done previously.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"There was a time not too long ago, from about 2000-2006, when you could not avoid pop punk. The bands that played this type of music were everywhere, and new bands were coming out of the woodwork every day it seemed. New Found Glory were among the poineers of these bands, arriving on the scene around 1999, just as this style of music was breaking through. The genre went through changes, with sunny pop-punk slowly being replaced by emo\/screamo, and eventually, a whole new crop of younger bands started to push the old ones away. New Found Glory has never gone away, and as a matter of fact, their last album (2009's \"Not Without A Fight\") was one of their most honest and straightforward efforts. In order for a band to survive these constant changes in the scene, they need to keep making good records.\n\nAnd Radiosurgery is good. It is DARN good. As a matter of fact, it just might be the band's best yet. Opting to return to the sound of their earlier albums, NFG has picked up the tempo even more this time around, and the songwriting is spot-on. Some of the tracks are a little on the poppy side, such as the title track and first single \"Radiosurgery.\" Others hit hard with a refreshing blast of punk energy (the cover version of \"Blitzkreig Pop\" is one of the best punk covers I've ever heard.) Literally, out of fifteen tracks, thirteen are near exceptional. This stands out as the only NFG album to not have any bad songs; they really got it right this time around. Jordan Pundik's vocals are great throughout, and Chad Gilbert attacks these songs like it was his last day on earth, making the album sound immediate, but still lots of fun.\n\nOn the inside cover of this album, it reads \"Pop Punk is Not Dead.\" A trio of great albums over the past several months by Blink 182, Simple Plan, and now New Found Glory seems to confirm that statement. This is one of those albums, like Green Day's \"Dookie,\" that is worth buying the physical CD and keeping it in your collection for years. I'd run through each song but you know what the band sounds like, and believe me, you will not be disappointed. In my review of \"Not Without A Fight,\" I stated that NFG had an exceptional album hidden within them somewhere; an album where everything clicked, and the whole thing sounded great. This is their moment. And it does not matter that it came in 2011 instead of 2001, or any other time in between. Pop punk may or may not be dead, but New Found Glory is alive and well.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"This is an album about loss and survival. It's darker than some of Lucinda's other releases. It may not be for all Williams fans; it certainly is very different and more experimental than her last three albums. If you're uncertain about it the first time, give it a couple of other spins--it'll grow on you. The depth of emotion and Lucinda's raw vocals (meaning they weren't re-recorded--producer Hal Wilner used the demo vocal tracks as he loved the emotion in the performances) give this album an extra kick. I've seen some mixed reviews from fans here--I suspect this is an album that fans will probably come back to later and realize how good it is.\n\nClearly under the influence of later Dylan (perhaps \"Time Out of Mind\"), the album features a nice mixture of midtempo numbers and killer ballads. Williams' voice which aches with longing and bitterness in many of these songs continues to be one of her strengths in addition to her top notch songwriting. She strikes reminds me somewhat of John Hiatt. \"Words\" has one of the sweetest melodies Williams has come up with the opening line sums up much of this album--\"I would rather suffer in sweet silent solitude\". She may feel like she's in solitude but these moving, observant songs open up a world to music fans everywhere.\n\nThe music clips might be a bit deceptive. This is a moody, atmospheric album (even more so than her previous efforts). It also sounds even more personal than usual. The musicians that provide backing on the album including vets such as Jim Keltner give the album a distinctive sound. Producer Hal Willner does a great job of capturing the rich, distinctive qualities of Williams' voice.\n\nThis is one of Williams' finest albums holding its own with \"Lucinda Williams\", \"Sweet Old World\" and \"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road\". Be aware, however, if you are a Williams fan that this is probably one of her more experimental albums and one of her most moody, atmospheric productions yet. Kudos to Hal Willner who convinced Williams to keep many of her raw, demo vocals for the album. What they may lack in polish they make up for in emotion.\n\nBestBuy is currently offering an edition with a second disc featuring two demos for tracks on the main album. \"Where Is My Love\" and \"Rescue\" (both terrific songs). Personally, I'd love to hear some acoustic demos or performances of some of these songs vs. electric demos but that's me. Pick it up today!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Over the years I've been impressed by what I've heard from Angie Stone. That is,what I've heard on a couple tribute albums and duets with other artists. One of the only reasons that I never bothered with an Angie Stone album until this point is because I kept asking myself what Angie had to offer that Jill Scott,Chrissette Michelle and Lalah Hathaway couldn't. Of course that would imply I expected every artist to be 100% original. Realizing my short sighted frame of mind I decided to to see for myself,within the context of the neo soul genre more over then the artist,what she had to offer creatively. I'm rather surprised by the results.\n\n  This album does offer a lot of variety. It has a handful of fairly ordinary neo soul type songs on \"Do What You Gotta Do\",the title song and the blunted jazz-hop flavored \"Alright\" Of course it's on songs such as \"Backup Plan\",\"Livin' It Up\",\"Right In From Of Me\" and \"U Lit My Fire\" that really excite me,and that's a good chunk of the album right there. These four numbers are rhythmically strong funk era friendly dance numbers with strong hooks,vocal harmonies and excellent use of modern production techniques for tunes that could easily be retro exercises. \"I Can't Take It\" brings in this heavier proto funk polyrhythm flavor to the proceedings,sort of a cross between James Brown and what the late Amy Winehouse was going for.\n\n  Angie concludes the album with the harmonically and melodically complex \"Sisters\". With lyrics that range from romantically sassy to touchingly personal,including the mildly self promotional spoken word interlude from Malcolm Jamal Warner,this album does an excellent job at portraying the many hues of Angie Stone's soulful musical rainbow. She primarily focuses on 70's era dance\/funk numbers with a lot of reliance on rhythmic and harmonically complex melodies. On the other hand she also visits territories already explored as a reminder of where she came from as well. So this is an excellent example of what was in Angie's music (that I've heard that is) and what may be to come in her future.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"To my way of thinking Linda Ronstadt is among the most versatile and gifted female vocalists in the history of American popular music. Case in point: in 1983 Linda Ronstadt was generally considered to be the leading female vocalist of the Rock Era. You can imagine the head scratching by her producer and her legions of fans when she boldly announced that she would be recording an album of standards with the legendary arranger and bandleader Nelson Riddle. It all began a year earlier when Linda called Riddle and asked him if he would consider arranging one song for her upcoming album. Rather, Riddle suggested that he do the entire album himself and thus \"What's New\" was conceived. Evidently Linda Ronstadt knew what she was doing because \"What's New\" sold more than two million copies and spent an impressive 81 weeks on Billboard's Album chart. In my view her recording of this 1939 standard from the Great American Songbook is the best thing she ever did.  And given her extensive and varied discography that is saying a lot!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"It is honestly and absolutely so sad that someone whom has became a product, not a real singer has made more songs that make them just tiresome and more annoying at the soul. Tragically, Rihanna has been one of those singers that really has been more of a product, not from the soul, just overexposed with each and every song she has came out with. Unfortunately, with all the songs that she had came out with, setting up her Anti album, has been poor and lagging at her soul. Her prior single, Work showed again her own voice losing steam, and feeling weak and like is on drugs, during her song. Kiss It Better is also a bleak waste of time. She doesn't deliver a more seductive performance in the heart, and makes the listener feel like they have not been seduced and enchanted from each not sung. It is just a loss at the heart. I definitely think it is time for Rihanna to just retire alone. Perhaps when she walks away, if she walks away, she'll find better on the other side to make it kissed better.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":3}

{"text":"Reznor's \"Ghosts I-IV\" is good.  That much I am sure of, and while I'm not completely sure what I think about it yet, whatever the final verdict is, he had an interesting idea that was worth exploring.\n\n\"Ghosts\" is odd not because of its large number of tracks or because it is purely instrumental, but because it is so thematic.  Despite the wide spectrum of possibilities he could have explored making an instrumental album, and his proven ability to conjure up some truly bizarre ambience (like in a lot of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Downward-Spiral\/dp\/B000001Y5Z\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Downward Spiral<\/a>), he focused almost solely on loop driven, rhythmic pieces in which most of the sound comes from guitar or piano.  For better or for worse, \"Ghosts\" is nowhere near as diverse as the instrumental work from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Fragile\/dp\/B00001P4TH\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Fragile<\/a>.\n\nAlthough others have said they find each volume of the 4 contained in \"Ghosts I-IV\" to be thematically different, I find the entire thing to be a consistent mood piece... spacious and reminiscent of a desert landscape, with forays into cool caves and shaded spaces, but always with that incredibly dry aesthetic.  The volumes only differ in the sounds added or subtracted from their palettes (for example, III has a lot more Aphex Twin-esque synth basslines).\n\nInitially many of the guitar riffs and piano arrangements seem signature Reznor, almost to the point of self parody.  However, the strength of \"Ghosts\" really lies in the careful organization and panning of sounds, the gradual swell of every track into a usually abrupt cut-off.  Despite lacking the free-form organization of true ambient music, these songs really are sound environments.  The lack of development in each track matters little when each song is a trip back to a different area of the same imaginary land...\n\n\"Ghosts I-IV\" may lack some of the intensity of previous NIN because the way it's put together prevents any kind of tension from building, but it's still full of great ideas.  I also give \"Ghosts I-IV\" a lot of credit for being a double album that I almost always listen to in one sitting, a rare thing (I don't even usually do that with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Fragile\/dp\/B00001P4TH\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Fragile<\/a>).

Most of the album is highly pop, but there's just enough of a rock edge to give the album some genuine flair.  Each song is meticulously crafted and extremely catchy.  In fact, \"Sports\" by Huey and the gang is so incredibly song-driven, you almost hope for a mistake somewhere along the way.  I disagree strongly with the added live tracks and session tracks that have been tacked on to the latest remastered version of this album, since it takes away from the '80s classicism one originally heard: just 8 quick songs and that was it.  Of course, nowadays record companies must include all sorts of bells and whistles to get people buying, but back in the '80s, man, all we needed were the tunes!\nWell, what else can I say?  Huey writes surprisingly in-depth lyrics that speak to everybody.  And, Huey's band is known for liking the blues, as is evident on the eighth and final track (or at least it was the final track until Huey's record company messed with the album).  At any rate, \"Sports\" by Huey is a sure-fire hole-in-one.  No doubt about it, Huey and the boys racked up a spectacular touchdown with this record, scored a 3-point bucket with mere seconds left on the clock, ran back a 85-yard touchback to tie the game, pitched a no-hitter, won the match in straight sets, ran the 400-meter race in record time...","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"When I originally heard \"How To Rob\" from the \"In Too Deep\" soundtrack, I liked the song and the clever wordplay involved, but I wondered if 50 Cent had enough to carry a whole album.  Rappers like Jay Z, Ghostface Killah, Sticky Fingaz from Onyx and others weren't too pleased with what 50 had to say and they came out with their own things to say about the song.  Just as 50 was about to record his 1st single from \"Power Of The Dollar\", \"Thug Love\" w\/Destiny's Child, 50 was shot multiple times.  After he recovered, 50 called his label and they acted as if 50 had never even existed.  To reestablish himelf, 50 hit the mixtape circuit and would appear on various mixtapes freestyling or with songs that were supposed to appear on \"Power Of The Dollar\".  In early 2002, Full Clip Records released \"Guess Who's Back\" which included underground songs and freestyles that included 50, G Unit, Nas, Nature, The Bravehearts and Bun B of UGK on different tracks.  Shortly after that, 50 Cent & G Unit released several mixed Cds and the buzz definitely had been recreated.  Eminem heard \"Guess Who's Back\" after he completed \"The Eminem Show\" and that was the beginning of 50 Cent being signed to Eminem's Shady Records.  50 Cent's popular mix tape track, \"Wanksta\" appeared on Eminem's \"8 Mile\" soundtrack, as well as,  \"Places To Go\" and \"Love Me\" which was  a collaboration with Eminem, 50 Cent and Obie Trice.  These songs and the mixed CDs were enough to keep 50 out in the streets until his highly anticipated CD, \"Get Rich Or Die Trying\", was released.  When \"In Da Club\" was released to radio and started appearing on MTV and BET, 50's CD was definitely going to be in demand.  Dr. Dre's club banger had everyone sayig \"Go, go, go, go, go..\".  The song would propel \"Get Rich Or Die Trying\" with over 800,000 units sold in the first four days of its release.  The CD gets off a nice start with \"What's Up Gangsta\".  Fans of 50's street releases will definitely like this track.  Next up is \"Patiently Waiting\" as Eminem and 50 collaborate on the Eminem produced track.  50 and Eminem rip the track to shreds.  On \"Many Men (Wish Death)\", 50 speaks about how after being shot multiple times, how he reflects on things and how your enemies and people that are jealous of you are always plotting behind your back.  This is one of \"Get Rich Or Die Trying's\" best tracks.  Dr. Dre shows up again to produce the passion filled \"Heat\".  50 is back in street mode once again and has an anthem for anyone that wants to come at him and his G Unit crew.  \"If I Can't\" is more of a radio friendly Dre song but you will forget the commercial appeal of the song once you hear 50 rhyming to the track.  \"Back Down\" has 50 speaking on his long term beef with Ja Rule.  This is the CD's best track, in my opinion, as 50 says, \"You're a pop tart, sweetheart, you're soft in the middle...\".  Since then there have been several back and forth disses with the latest being \"Hail Mary 2003\" with Eminem, 50 Cent & Busta Rhymes.  The 2nd single, \"21 Questions\" with Nate Dogg is an ode for the ladies that will definitely continue to keep \"Get Rich Or Die Trying\" on the charts for awhile.  \"Don't Push Me\" w\/Lloyd Banks of G Unit and Eminem, has 50 Cent rapping a little too much like 2 Pac for some people.  I like the song as the rappers flow lovely to the Eminem's beat.  \"Poor Lil Rich\" is a Sha Money XL track that plans keep 50 in heavy club rotation along with the aforementioned \"In Da Club\" and \"P.I.M.P\".  The only song that you will have to fast forward, in my opinion, is \"Blood Hound\" with Young Buck as it sounds like DMX is barking throughout the whole song. \"Get Rich Or Die Trying\" also includes \"Wanksta\", \"U Not Like Me\", and \"Life's On The Line\" as bonus tracks, but loyal 50 fans have heard these tracks already.  50 recently released a DVD, \"The New Breed\" that included a bonus CD with 3 tracks:  \"True Loyalty\" with G Unit, \"8 Mile Road\" (G Unit Remix)with G Unit, and the Dr. Dre produced \"In Da Hood\" with Brooklyn.  To anyone who doesn't know G Unit is 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Bang 'Em Smurf and a cast of other characters.  G Unit recently signed with Interscope Records, so a G Unit CD and a Lloyd Banks solo CD should be out by the end of the year and expect a new 50 Cent CD by February 2004.  For 50 Cent the sky is the limit.  If you judge \"Get Rich Or Die Trying\" by just \"In Da Club\" and \"21 Questions\" then you will be saddenly mistakened.  This CD has more than club friendly songs on it.  Fans of 50's street anthems will enjoy this CD as well.  I wonder how Columbia feels now that 50 Cent has sold more than 4 million records in 10 weeks?  I would advise you to get \"Get Rich Or Die Trying\" and \"Guess Who's Back\" to start your 50 library.  FREE YAYO!!!!\nJames' Top 5\n1) Back Down\n2) Many Men (Wish Death)\n3) P.I.M.P\n4) What Up Gangsta\n5) 21 Questions w\/Nate Dogg","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Meg Myers is a singer-songwriter, in the vein of other female \"confessional\" singer-songwriters such as Fiona Apple\/Tori Amos\/Liz Phair. Before this, Myers had released two EPs, 2013's \"Daughter In the Choir\" debut EP, and last year's \"Make A Shadow\", both equally outstanding. After what seems to be an eternity (it's now 2 1\/2 years since the debut EP), finally here comes the long-anticipated full length debut album.\n\n\"Sorry\" (10 tracks; 41 min.) opens with \"Motel\", which sets the tone with its deeply personal lyrics (the song's opening lines: \"You're weak, broken in a motel\/You blink, tears are falling down, down, down\/And you're free, free inside your own hell', wow...). Up next is the album's title track, another heavy duty song, very similar to the \"Make A Shadow\" EP soundscape. Speaking of which, three of the songs on that EP are included on the album: there is the fantastic \"Desire\", still her best song to date for me, and much deeper into the album we also get \"Make A Shadow\" and the gentler \"The Morning After\", mostly just Meg an her acoustic guitar. If you've been a longtime fan, though, you are starving for new songs, of which there are seven (`only' seven?) on this album.  The best for me from those is \"Lemon Eyes\" (1st single), another hard-hitting song (\"Hush now baby\/There's no need to cry\/Let me wipe away those lemon eyes\"). \"I Really Want You To Hate Me\" could be viewed as the ultimate Meg Myers tune: deeply personal, a lot of anger and confrontation (\"I really want you to hate me\/I really want you to find\/That I am bitter and angry\/That I'm no mother of a child\"), while it's all served up with killer music. This may not be for everyone, but I personally love this stuff. Smartly, Myers keeps this album at a fairly short running time (just over 40 min.) as much of this is heavy duty stuff, and wears you out fairly quickly. But the bottom line for me is that this is a stellar debut album, and sure to end up very high on my \"best of\" year-end album list, if not at the very top.\n\nYou haven't had the full Meg Myers experience until you have seen her in concert. I saw her last year here in Cincinnati when she was touring in support of the \"Make A Shadow\" EP, and it absolutely floored me. Myers played with a ferocity and intensity that I can't recall very often having seen before. You're not gonna mess with her! And she not just sings, she also plays at times either bass guitar or electric guitar. Myers is scheduled to come back to Cincinnati next month, headlining at a small venue, and you can bet your last dollar that I will be front and center for that. Meanwhile, \"Sorry\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n*UPDATE* Oct. '15 I saw Meg in concert earlier this week, and what a show it was. She played of course most of the new album, but also some earlier nuggets, like Curbstomp from her very first EP. Meg was in great form throughout, and interacting with the crowd in a playful way. Tremendous Set all around.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"As many have noted, this set is an incredible bargain, especially for 99 cents. 15 hours of great music in good to excellent performances in pretty good sound is hard to beat, especially since these are full pieces rather than snippets. I'm especially impressed, so far, by Hungerford's sonnets for piano (which I'd always wanted to hear), Matthews performances of the piano variations, Abravanel's Creatures of Prometheus (a very interesting and hard to find piece), and the Yale Quartet's set of the late string quartets.\n\nBut, as the helpful reviews by N. Podaci and Sol L. Seigel have noted, there are a handful of glitches, the most important of which (omission of 3rd movement of SQ 15) was corrected by Customer Service, but the other ones not. Here's a quick guide to how to fix those glitches. In iTunes, you can make these changes by right clicking on a track, choosing \"Get Info\" from the pop-up menu, and then making the appropriate edit. First of all, reverse the order of the two movements of the Waldstein Sonata. Track 45 should be track 46, and vice versa.\nSecond, delete tracks 83 and 84. These are labeled as the last two movements of the Op. 127 String Quartet but they are really duplicates of the last two movements of the Quartet Op. 130. As you can see, track 82 is correctly labelled the \"Finale\" of Op. 127. Next, rename tracks 162-165. This piece is really Sonata No. 12, Op. 26 (\"Funeral March\"), not, as indicated, Sonata 26 (\"Les Adieu\"). You can google online for the correct tempo indicators for the four movements of Sonata No. 12. (Sonata 26 has only 3 movements!)\nOnce you've made these changes, you'll have a correctly labeled set of Beethoven masterpieces and all for less than a buck. I think its worth taking a couple of minutes to make it right. Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":3}

I bought several of the \"Rise of the Masters\" collections a few years back shortly after our son was diagnosed with his sensory processing disorder.  An OT recommended The Listening Program, but my little man doesn't do headphones.  And everything I looked at study wise on that seemed to be mixed, with some studies indicating that listening to plain classical music alone would produce similar benefits.  So I purchased these to play quietly in the background as we did other things.  Of all of the collections we got, he tolerates Mozart the longest.  I always knew that kid of mine had great taste ;)  The thing that to me is the stand out thing about this product is how many tracks you get for the price, and the quality if fine for what we were using it for.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"In my quest to find large, outstanding compilations of classical music at bargain prices, I have been very successful, unearthing several Big Box MP3 albums from The Bach Guild for 99 cents. They include&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Mozart-Box\/dp\/B00B5Q7M90\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Mozart Box<\/a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Haydn-Box\/dp\/B00CMAM8QA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Haydn Box<\/a>, and others. So far, I have found each of them a delightful listening experience.\n\nI recently added Bigger Beethoven Box to my digital library. This is the second of two Big Box albums featuring the works of Ludwig van Beethoven, and it is very good. It contains a wide selection of Beethovens compositions, including a comprehensive offering of his piano sonatas, his only violin concerto, his complete Diabelli variations and piano concertos, four of his nine symphonies, as well as dances, songs, rondos, bagatelles, and other works. All are performed with a high degree of artistry by a variety of world-class, but lesser known musicians.\n\nAlthough I think Bigger Beethoven Box it is very good, and certainly upholds the high standards of the other Big Box sets I own, I am slightly less enamored of it. This is mainly due to two reasons:\n\n1. There are no string quartets or piano trios on \"Bigger Beethoven Box.\" Many of Beethovens greatest chamber music masterpieces belong to these two sub-genres, and I think the fact that  none of them are included makes this a less comprehensive and well-rounded album.\n\n2. The albums engineering is not quite as good as it is on other Big Box albums  especially Big Mozart Box and Big Haydn Box. On most tracks, the sound is bright, clear, and well-balanced, but on a few others, the audio quality seems murky to my ears, and individual instruments are sometimes difficult for me to hear.\n\nDespite my concerns about Bigger Beethoven Box, I still think it is a very good sampler of Ludwig van Beethovens music. With first-rate performances by world-class musicians, its (for the most part) excellent audio quality, and its low price of 99 cents, it makes for an overall highly rewarding listening experience. Recommended.","classification":4,"fold":3}

That Huey was Hollywood photogenic didn't hurt during the peak years on MTV, making the videos for the songs fun to see (you can find them on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Greatest-Hits-CD-DVD-Combo\/dp\/B000FAO7ZE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Greatest Hits CD + DVD Combo<\/a>), but the band's slick combination of Pop Rock and R'n'B should not be underestimated.\n\nHuey's gruff but lovable voice carries the charm on much of his best work, and that made songs like \"Heart of Rock and Roll\" and \"Heart and Soul\" irresistible. They even found themselves in an unwarranted controversy when \"I Want a New Drug\" rankled the ire of some parent's groups. (And what sells records better?) They also had a great ear for covers, as they do a slick version of Hank William's \"Honky Tonk Blues.\"\n\nSlick is the operative word here. \"Sports\" was the pinnacle of Huey Lewis and The News' rough and cuddly period, still coming on like a hungry bar band.

That is not to say that The News weren't capable of taking a poke at themselves and their new-found status, one of the best hits from \"Fore\" was \"Hip to Be Square.\" But for sheer party-album thrills, \"Sports\" was hard to beat in the mid-80's.","classification":4,"fold":3}

As any of you fellow Millerites know, there was another album, MRS. MILLER DOES HER THING on Amaret just after Capitol, and a smattering of non-Lp sides on a few obscure 45s.  'Twould be nice for a complete set of her recordings, if, oh, say, Rhino Hand Made is listening\/reading this.\n\nI give this set, (in)glorious though it may be, three stars because, well, the cover art doesn't do justice to the package in place of whatever photographs that Capitol has buried away, and this set chops up what should have been a killer Capitol small box for not very much money.  To get most (not quite all, but most) of her output, you needs have this set and a needle-drop boot which was lovingly put together, THE TURNED-ON WORLD OF MRS. MILLER.  It's simply time to put out a definitive set while CDs are still being made as the geezer format of choice.\n\nThe only artist comparable to Mrs. Miller to generate yowls of \"Turn it down!\", \"What is that @#$&?\", and \"Can't you play something else!?!\" whenever I play this on the speakers is Nico.\n\nI seriously, seriously doubt, however, that the greatest of all inspiration, The Inimitable Sam Sacks (Arliss 3301), will ever see loving restoration.

We also get both the English and Japanese lyrics thrown in as an insert.  The cardboard packaging which is a replica of the original vinyl sleeve is also a work of art.  While the strength of \"Girl From Ipanema\" alone would carry this album, we also get \"So Danco Samba\" and a version of \"Desafinado\" here which is good but not as great as the brilliant version with that unforgetable Getz solo on the \"Jazz Samba\" album which although not as commercially successful as this album, is still overall the stronger album.  Still, there is no denying the great impact this album has had on jazz and on bringing the whole samba genre onto the world map that this is still essential listening for fans of jazz and indeed for any fan of music in general.

This is the same band that created the masterpieces Images and Words, and Awake, some of my favorite albums of all time. I understand their glory days are far behind them but they've since gone on to write some of the most soulless prog rock and metal out there. Where has the good quality songwriting gone? What's with the bad production on this album? These guys are acting more like prog amateurs instead of the veterans that they are. They either  need to lose this homage\/tribute rock opera junk and get back to writing original quality albums, or hang it up. They're borrowing so much from bands like Rush, Pink Floyd, Queen, and they're not even doing it that well. Where's the heart and soul on this thing? I can't even bring myself to finish this. DT have gotten much much worse since Octavarium and I'm sorry to have to say so because I really don't like to see this. Their last 4 albums or so are just mediocre and forgettable.

That being said, I just listened to the entire album in it's remastered form and all I could say is wow. This is remastering at it's finest. They didn't add a lot of bass or loudness. Everything just sounds cleaner and more vibrant. Sort of like looking through a window that was just cleaned and you can see really clearly all the detail. Sound is an A+. Second, the package could have been a litte nicer. What I mean by that is they could have included liner notes and more pictures. But, it still is a nice package. Third, the bonus tracks are clutch. They include all the b-sides from the singles from Nevermind. However, they should have included the No Alternative version of Verse Chorus Verse. I'm not big on demos and alternate takes, etc. If In Utero gets this treatment in two years you will get to finally hear the definitive version of MV instead of the demo from the box set. That song is incredible. It's on the All Apologies maxi single from the UK. Extemely difficult to get, but I have my copy. Lastly, this album is ground breaking. I'm tired of certain kids just not appreciating this. You have to understand, this  was 1991 and there wasn't pro tools or any main stream music like this out yet. You actually had to be talented to make music back then. You ever notice how a lot of rock bands sound the same today? There are still great bands out there though.

{"text":"\"Voyage - Hiroshima Eternal\" is the third release from artist\/sculptor\/architect\/electronic musician\/composer Takashi Suzuki. Born and currently residing in Hiroshima, Japan, Suzuki  designed a monument for Edmund Blunden's poem, \"A Song for August 6th, 1949,\" which won first place in a competition in 1975 and stands in the garden of The Hiroshima Central Library. The sculpture features the words to the poem in both English and Japanese and is still a stunning and moving tribute to the spirit and resilience of the city and its people following one of the darkest days of modern history. Despite the title, the music composed for this album is neither a memorial nor a protest against nuclear weapons. It is Suzuki's imaginary story of someone who died in the event and then journeys through the unknown spiritual world. The eight tracks and their titles are the imagined stages of the journey, ending with reincarnation and a new life.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Suzuki composes his music in a similar manner to creating his visual artwork, finishing one piece before moving to the next and allowing the previous work to influence the new work. This gives his music a linear quality and continuity that is its own evolution. Very minimal as well as ambient, the music has a dark, soulful quality that is sometimes mysterious or mournful and sometimes a bit lighter and more hopeful (but not joyous). The mood lightens gradually as the journey progresses and the spirit finds its way and discovers its purpose. Created with synths, the instrumentation includes ethereal and atmospheric sounds, strings, voices, bells, light percussion, and other sounds without any specific cultural reference. As with Suzuki's previous releases, the sound quality is full and rich. \"Resonance,\" his debut, received the 2011 Best Ambient Album award from Zone Music Reporter, and \"Cycle\" was nominated as the Best Relaxation\/Meditation Album and Best Ambient Album for 2012 by the same organization. I would fully expect similar acclaim for \"Voyage,\" another extraordinary musical experience from this fascinating artist.","classification":5,"fold":3}

You will hear a soprano voice singing in unison, matching him note for note, seemingly keeping the power he projects in check. Their two voices give O Holy Night the smooth, flowing feeling it deserves. The soprano is the light lyric Soprano, Jackie Evancho, noted for her smooth, effortless soprano range. Vittorio and Jackie combine their interpretive skills in a way that makes each phrase, each verse a work of art.\n\nVittorio first met Jackie on a special appearance of \"Dancing with the Stars\", and now again, as Jackie now joins him on the Sony Masterworks label.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"\"Dopes to Infinity\" is Monster Magnet at their absolute best. Listening to Dave Wyndorf and the gang's recent output it's hard to even compare, such is the fall from grace. Thankfully though, this album and its predecessors are superb. Catchy, melodic, fuzzy and spacey, the sound is irresistible.\n\nIn fact, the first six tracks on \"Dopes to Infinity\" make up some of the very best stoner rock to come out of the 90s. Tracks like \"Look to Your Orb For Warning\", \"Negasonic Teenage Warhead\" and the title track perfectly blend grooving, fuzzy riffs with melodic hooks, all encapsulating Wyndorf's raspy and powerful vocals. There's slower, more psychedelic edged tracks, the best of which \"All Friends and Kingdom Come\" wonderfully forges a kind of melancholy, trippy atmosphere. It's all great and consistent listening. Monster Magnet at their best are superb; it's a real shame it went downhill from here.\n\nI've noted someone has tagged this album as 'mean'. Damn right, this is mean f**king goodness.

However, after having endured twenty five years or more of mindless electonically synthesized \"music\" I went back to my roots. I didn't think anybody actually sang anymore, or could play more than four notes in a riff without making a loop out of it. Slowly, I learned that there are bands out there that are making some great music with intelligence, and even coming up with some fresh and energic material. On a whim I took a chance on the Pretty Reckless, whom I had never heard of before, and was blown away. I can't believe such a skinny whisp of a girl ( as you can see from the photos) can belt those songs out as she does. Great lyrics. This band has talent.

{"text":"By the early 1970s the Philly Sound of Gamble & Huff had eclipsed Motown as the most successful R&B hit-making machine in the music biz and The Three Degrees were like The Supremes of the whole enterprise. Although they had been together for a decade before this album was released, 1974 was THE year the Three Degrees really made their mark. Not only did they have a US Top 5 and UK #1 hit with the beautiful, wistful WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN, but they also sang a small part at the end of the funky Billboard #1 instrumental hit by MFSB called TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia) which is included here as a welcome bonus track.\n\nFor those new to the group, this is as good a place to start as any. I have purchased five of their albums on CD recently and this one definitely ranks as one of their best. That unmistakable Gamble & Huff sound is all over it. The vocals are smooth and velvety, so don't expect a 1970s girl group that is as spirited as the Pointer Sisters or gritty as Labelle. The arrangements are full and rich and complex even on the ballads with ear-catching tempo changes and unique structures that make the album a very interesting and satisfying listen. On CANT YOU SEE WHAT YOURE DOING TO ME the gals punctuate each delivery of the line with a strong Bay-Bee that really makes the song.  A WOMAN NEEDS A GOOD MAN glides back and forth from classy to sassy with a hi-hat that picks up steam on the bridges only to pull back and slow down for the next versebrilliant! The throbbing DIRTY OL MAN was a big UK hit but didn't catch on in North America; perhaps radio programmers thought the title was too risqu? Who knowsall I know is its catchy as heck. The epic IF AND WHEN outclasses even WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN as the most gorgeous cut on the album, but it was probably too big and grand for radio airplay when picking the singles.\n\nId give this album FIVE STARS except a few numbers here sound a little too much like commercial jingles: I LIKE BEING A WOMAN and YEAR OF DECISION and bonus track LOVE IS THE MESSAGE, otherwise Id rank this as one of their essential albums along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/New-Dimensions\/dp\/B003UN58WY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">New Dimensions<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/3d-Three-D\/dp\/B004IOP1JO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">3d (Three D)<\/a>&nbsp;which were both produced by Giorgio Moroder.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Oh, my gosh, this album is beautiful! I've always loved what Lenny Kravitz does; with his blend of soulful vocals, funky style and rock-edged beats, he is totally unique and has carved out a niche for himself that to my knowledge, only he occupies. The hits over the years have been are always brilliant - \"Are You Gonna Go My Way\", \"It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over\", \"Fly Away\", et al - but I've always felt that the real heart & soul of the man was to be found on his album cuts.\n\nThe last album of his I bought was 2001's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Lenny\/dp\/B000LYM580\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Lenny<\/a>&nbsp;(2004's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Baptism\/dp\/B0001XAMC2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Baptism<\/a>&nbsp;passed me by completely) and though it was the single \"Dig In\" that made me buy it (after I heard it playing in a clothes store) it was tunes like \"If I Could Fall In Love\", \"Yesterday Is Gone (My Dear Kay)\", \"Stillness Of Heart\", \"Believe In Me\", \"A Million Miles Away\" and \"Let's Get High\" (which is not a song about drugs, by the way), that made me fall in love with the album, though some of these were also subsequently released as singles.\n\nI don't hear any stand out hit singles along the lines of the ones I mentioned at the top but the album is no less enjoyable for it. I was nodding my head, tapping my feet and humming along right from the first play. These are all fantastic tunes with great vocal performances, solid beats and lots of wailing guitar. Favourites include \"Love Revolution\", \"Love Love Love\", \"I'll Be Waiting\" (heavenly orchestral), \"Will You Marry Me\" (totally funky, totally James Brown), \"A Long And Sad Goodbye\" (a plea in pain to a father; I can totally identify), \"This Moment Is All There Is\" (a heart-melting, hypnotic ballad), \"A New Door\" (another beautiful ballad) and \"I Want To Go Home\" (a great sing-along tune and a great way to close the album).\n\nThe album is produced and arranged by Kravitz and largely written and performed by him too, with help primarily from Craig Ross on electric guitar, acoustic guitar, mandolin & handclaps, from a bassist whose name I couldn't make out, and from a long list of background vocalists and orchestra members. I'd name them all but I can barely see the writing on the inner-sleeve notes - the only flaw this album has, as far as I'm concerned. Simply beautiful. Rock on, Lenny, rock on. You go, boy.","classification":5,"fold":3}

The beginning isn't as creative as it was on the previous album, and on this on, less tolerable.  I don't want to hear this dude's sermon every time I plug it in.  Misdirection and artsy distractions usually equate to filler (Remember the long drone on that forgettable Wilco album designed to fill it into a full length album?)\n\nMusically and lyrically there is nothing spectacular here.  The flourishes of 80s keyboard and guitar work with a sort of uptempo swagger is less interesting to me than what attention Conor gave to the previous Bright Eyes, Mystic Valley and solo album song structures.  This has a let's have fun mood to it but I have to look elsewhere for fun.\n\nI can see why some would like it though.  (No, I can't)\n\nNot a particularly interesting Bright Eyes effort.","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"It has been a very long time since we have heard anything from Don Henley. The last time he made a solo album, was back in 2000 with Inside Job, and he just delivered so nicely. His music on his own has been remarkable, just as much with the massive success of The Eagles, and their return in 2007 with Long Road Out Of Eden, which really delivered all over with fans young and old. But, either way Don said he would rather take his time and make new work very fast. His latest song is definitely a nice step in his classic direction. Still, in his sixties, Don has not aged a single bit, and Take A Picture Of This, the latest single off of Don Henley's upcoming album Cass County is a good and classic song, simple and strong as his classic soul and rock edge ignites. It is definitely a great return, and that he hasn't changed one bit with his work. I was definitely marveled with his classic sound again, and if you have never heard an album like The End Of The Innocence or Hotel California, you'll definitely want to become a Don Henley fan. This will definitely tide you over.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":3}

Now this wouldn't be a problem if these songs were of the quality that we are used to on afore mentioned CDs by Johnny. What we have here are some half decent songs, that whilst not awful, are a par down on what we are used to from this artist. On to many of these songs, they all merge into each other. Only a hardcore fan\/lover of quiet storm moment would fine anything of any value here. I never had my copy for long, giving it to my big Sister, who loved all things Johnny back then.\nAs for the more the more up-tempo songs, 'I know you Want me is OK' as is 'So gentle'.\nThis was the last Johnny Gill Cd I purchased( and I think that this was his last major solo CD release) With a voice like Mr. Gill has, this is a crying shame!","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"The second half of Tremontis recent solo outing (Cauterize was the first) lays it down fast, heavy, and hard but is a better release than Cauterize because the songs separate and distinguish themselves a lot better across this release than on the previous one. They have more of their own individual voices, and more dynamics probably because he shifts tempos more than on that last release. So in a lot of respects this is more similar to All I Was than to Cauterize, but it flows better than both of those and you can hear Tremontis maturity and growth on this release. This will blister your ears on the initial listens and then cause you to reflect on future spins. Im listening to Catching Fire as I write this and am hearing some of the subtle background atmosphere and sonics that enhance this and many of the other tracks on Dust. And Im digging it. Marks singing is a lot smoother and there are more back-up notes from the other voices that just create a fuller feeling, a deeper emotion, and more energy. Even though were not quite through with 2016 I think that its safe for me to say that this is my favorite metal release for this year.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"First off let me say, I am a huge fan of Dr, Dre.  I don't like a lot of rap, in fact, I really only like Dr. Dre productions.  The Chronic and 2001 were epic, monumental releases.  A sign of the times, but innovative and genre earth shattering releases.  Dr, Dre had been working on a follow up for years, upon years, upon years, and in the last couple of years dropped some tracks for his 3rd, supposedly solo album.  Fast forward to August 7th and I see this album available on iTunes.  I purchased without hesitation.  It's Dr. Dre.  Even when he doesn't release his own albums, he's always maintained a high production profile for other artists and his production is still Dr. Dre.  Upon first listen to this, I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  It's as if Dr. Dre, the innovator, the beat master, the pioneer, the Dr. who changed the face of rap music, is influenced by I guess those who were influenced by him over the years.  There is nothing original, there is no earth shattering beats, and there is definitely No Chronic whatsoever.  This album sounds hastily put together, to coincide with the NWA movie just recently released, a rush release that sounds so overwhelming by todays artists and sounds. And to see that movie about NWA and then here this it's like asking yourself what happened to Dr. Dre.  NWA created the sound, the style, Dr. Dre defined it with The Chronic, and 2001.  This is not a Dr Dre that we all grown to jam and bounce to.  Dre day is history.","classification":2,"fold":3}

{"text":"Ok, so maybe I'm slighly out of Sabrina's target age group [Disney Channel's devoted audience of tween girls] ...but upon hearing Ms. Carpenter sing, I was quite impressed by this girl's vocal abilities.\n\nUnlike numerous DC cohorts, Carpenter can actually sing.  No auto-tune here!  Sabrina Carpenter's the real deal.\n\nThe songs on this album are age-appropriate & provide a little something for all ages.\n\nTracks \/notes:\n\n1. Eyes Wide Open - easily the most radio-friendly track on here, hence there's more production [but not to the point Carpenter's voice is unrecognizable] compared to other songs on the album.  Still makes for a fun, catchy opener!\n\n2. Can't Blame a Girl for Trying - has a breezy vibe to it (a la Colbie Callait)\n\n3. The Middle of Starting Over - a G-rated version (melody-wise) of \"Trouble\" by Natalia Kilks, a singer who's definitely NOT for the kiddos(:\n\n4. We'll Be The Stars - a very inspiring little pop tune!\n\n5. Two Young Hearts - interesting melody; definitely allows Carpenter's vocals to take center stage.  Sounds like \"Two More Lonely People\" by Miley Cyrus.\n\n6. Your Love's Like - more heavily produced (like the title track); very pop-sounding (again, like the title track)\n\n7. Too Young - sounds a little like Taylor Swift's \"Back To December\".  Very pretty!\n\n8. Seamless - picking up a country-pop vibe on this one; could picture Carrie Underwood recording this track\n\n9. Right Now - another breezy, light Colbie Caillat-esq. tune.\n\n10. Darling I'm a Mess - a cute little indie pop-sounding track.\n\n11. White Flag - NOT a cover of the Dido song \"White Flag\".  Once more, an all-out campy pop tune.\n\n12. Best Thing I Got\n\nMy only hope for this girl is, once she has \"aged out of\" DC \/the House of Mouse is done with her, Carpenter won't spiral out of control (a la Lindsay, Miley, etc.) as she graduates into adult life because that would be such a waste of talent and a sad sight to see...","classification":5,"fold":3}

Unfortunately, she still has had a whole to deal with, especially with her music taking a tailspin downward. She still needs to find her own voice again. Her latest set of songs for the past several years have honestly not been the best in her voice. Her last album A.K.A. was so poor, it was not even close to even worth buying. That has also been the same with her last album Love?, which took several years, and a few poor starts.  I'm Into You, isn't exactly one of her better songs on the album. The song feels like I've heard it from Jennifer before, and it feels very weak from the heart alone. Her and Lil' Wayne have absolutely poor chemistry along the song. I really didn't find Jennifer gave it her best, honestly her weakest on this album. Hopefully, she needs to make better when her next album comes up.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":3}

Released in November of 1983, the song and its groundbreaking video helped give the album one final sales push to keep it in the top ten well over a year after its release.  While the song has become a staple around Halloween and probably gets more current airplay than other songs from the album, it is one of the album's weaker tracks.

{"text":"\"Smoke on the Water,\" originally from the great Deep Purple album \"Machine Head,\" has one of the most iconic riffs in all of rock courtesy of Ritchie Blackmore and his Strat. This somewhat extended version, recorded live in Japan, has, if anything, even more energy than the original. Easily the most recognizable and popular song from Deep Purple's catalogue, the song chronicles an actual event. In December 1971 Deep Purple was in Montreux, Switzerland to record an album at the Montreux Casino next to Lake Geneva using mobile recording equipment owned by the Rolling Stones. During a Frank Zappa concert on December 4, a fan set off a flare gun, setting the ceiling on fire and burning the complex to the ground. The flames and smoke drifted over the lake, while the members of Deep Purple watched. The band then had to scramble for a venue to record \"Machine Head\" in, and finally settled on the Montreux Grand Hotel. The song is quite an accurate piece of history, and definitely one of the heaviest, most listenable pieces of musical history ever recorded.\n\nThe song has appeared in various versions (the most amusing is from Pat Boone's \"In a Metal Mood,\" with Blackmore reprising his role on guitar) on many albums. I love live music, and highly endorse this version, and I also recommend \"Machine Head\" (the \"Best Hits\" album is also a good buy at a reasonable price.) One thing's certain, though: no musical library should be without this staple.","classification":5,"fold":3}

It took me a minute to find out the actual song title because on Sirius radio it just list the artist but after doing some research, I discovered it is a soundtrack from the new Spike Lee movie Chi-Raq, which I can't wait to see as well.","classification":5,"fold":3}
{"text":"I have now listened to this one through five times. I already thought it was quite good on first listen but after repeated sessions this is a masterpiece. Sorry to all of the Pink Floyd fans that seem to be putting this one down. To me this is a magical journey through all of the era's of Pink Floyd and that is what makes it so special. To put it into perspective with The Division Bell and A Momentary Lapse Of Reason, both of which I love, I find that this one actually sounds more like \"old Floyd\" which has been mentioned in many reviews. This will require at least three to four full listens with undivided attention. I find that it really picks up and just surges through the second half building momentum. Really incredible stuff here! The best Pink Floyd albums for me have had long drawn out instrumental passages like Echoes, Dogs, Shine On, and many more. A fitting end to an incredible career!\n\nEDIT: I will add a more detailed review of the vinyl soon. Side one appears super flat and very quiet but I have not had a chance to test the entire record.\n\nVINYL review: no issues at all, sounds incredible on a nice system. Flat and close to dead quiet although there was a little static on the second disc. I highly recommend purchasing this master work on vinyl to enjoy the best possible sound!","classification":5,"fold":3}

It's a great, catchy tune.  Using mostly electronic instrumentation, the song feels like both an homage to nostalgic 80's music and a forward-thinking piece of songwriting.  The vocals never rise above a calm croon, but the dynamics of the song range from stomping and loud to quiet and peaceful.  At times, it feels a bit reserved, but its patience feels more like a deliberate move than an unfortunate one.\n\nListeners who enjoy this song are recommended to check out the band's full-length GOSSAMER.  Recommended for fans of M83, Phoenix, and Walk the Moon.","classification":5,"fold":3}
{"text":"I have always imagined that being stuck in Lodi would be like being stuck with the Lotus Eaters in the Odyssey. Or like some sort of vortex, or the Twilight Zone. If you were going to be stuck anywhere in northern California, it is most likely going to be Lodi. The narrator ends up there after riding in on a greyhound to do a gig, then his friends go missing, his promise of fame vanishes, and he ends up singing the same songs over and over, trying to save up enough money to buy a train ticket out of there. I have never been to Lodi, but it is apparently the ''Zinfandel Capital of the World.\" You end up sipping some wine and before you know it you are a resident. I don't think the narrator thinks it's such a bad place, but it must be frustrating since he has been stuck there before.

Girls with baby blue eyes. Chevy pick-ups. I'm sick of it. I hear other artists putting out these beautiful lyrical songs with good messages and i think to myself, \"why can't these dudes do the same?\" Country is great genre. It can make an adventure song like no other. And guitar music is amazing all the time.\nBut the way these artists implement them... is just such a waste. A beautiful tune, great voice, a good beat... then they start singing about beer and it's like, \"What?\"\n\nSo when i heard this song, i was like, \"WHAT!?\" But in the total opposite direction!  It's awesome! I love this song!\n\nWe Were US is about two people who used to be together, broke up... but they just can't stop thinking of one another and they want at it again. The duet is fantastic and done magnificently. The tune is awesome and feels like an adventure. The lyrics flow perfectly. And together, it makes a wonderful song that you can dance to and think to.\n\nBuy it now! - and pray that other Country singers (males) will follow Keith & Miranda's example.

{"text":"Let's face it, Mr. Bubl&eacute; is the Frank Sinatra of today, and he's darn good at it. And in a world where half-hearted covers of Sinatra and others are common by half-hearted sell-outs trying to make a buck, Mr. Bubl&eacute; puts them all to shame. And it's not just his covers which are good, his originals are great too; \"Home\" was an awesome love song. However, this song seems to fall for the most part, flat. While Bubl&eacute;'s vocals are still as charming and brilliant as ever, the song itself could have been better. It's a simple song saying, you guessed it, you're my everything. Pretty darn simple to say the least. And while you could complain all day about how light and poppy the music sounds, I won't go into too much more depth than that.\n\nSo overall, not Bubl&eacute;'s best, and probably not even close. It's a light poppy tune, that keeps it very simple.

{"text":"Chevelle has followed their last album up with a heavier album with more usage of screaming Tha before. But this is a band that continues to put quality music at the forefront. While this album is not as experimental as \"La Gargola\" was, there are still moments where the band strays from their direction, with a song like \"Punchline\" which is the softest song on the disc, \"Shot From A Cannon\", which is the longest song on here and closes the album very well, and \"Enemies\", which has a punk feel to it. Overall, my favorite songs on here are \"Joyride (Omen)\" and \"Last Days\". One of the best albums of the year.

{"text":"Pick this up not knowing it was a two disc special,  just wanted to see what it was all about.  Fell in love instantly.  Gavin DeGraw is the new Van Morisson! . . sensitive, passionate, lyrical.  He doesn't possess the typical pop idol voice or much less a crooner's voice, what he has is a lot more.  Every emotion, every nuances of each lyric is riding on his unabashingly strong vocals, raw with feelings worn on his sleeve.  Makes a girl weak in the knees!  Chariot\/Stripped is his defining album wether he becames more famous or just a one CD wonder. The second CD is like icing because it showed the process of coming up with the finished product.  It was a nice bonus, highly recommend you listen to this one also.  Each song so masterfully crafted, so poetically written, most are about longings, falling in and out of love but my favorite is \"Over rated.\"  about how after meeting that special someone, everything else seems so ordinary.  So for all of you who are in  love, pre-falling in love, post break-up, or in the process of breaking up, this one's for you, come on, it's okay to be sensitive, it's okay to sing along, just make sure you're in your car, alone, commuting from work, with the windows closed.","classification":5,"fold":3}

Sadly, that showed that she lost her luster in her last song Triumphant, which proved to be less than striking from Mariah's Octaves. She is trying it again with Beautiful with Adorn singer Miguel. Sadly, I really found that there could've been more brought out from Mariah into the song. It seemed like Miguel brought out more to chew out Mariah Carey out of her own duet. It isn't a bad song, but there really wasn't enough chemistry both of them had shown into the connection of the song. I think Mariah Carey should really reconsider starting from scratch and find her voice all over again, before she makes another weak song.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"Coheed & Cambria's eighth album, \"The Color Before The Sun\" is the band's first album in at least ten years that wasn't born of adversity and boy, does it show. Eschewing the seemingly endless Amory Wars storyline that drove each of their previous albums, \"The Color Before The Sun\" finds the band treading some unfamiliar terrain while frontman\/guitarist\/mastermind Claudio Sanchez gets more personal than ever before.\n\nThe idea of Coheed & Cambria ditching their mythology (though temporary as it will likely turn out to be) and steering even further away from the beefy prog-rock\/pop combo that made them famous may be a turn off to some, but upon a first listen, \"The Color Before The Sun\" proves to be just as interesting and enjoyable as any of the band's more recent work. Almost like a merging of the stylistic approach taken on the band's previous \"Afterman\" double album with \"No World For Tomorrow,\" easily the band's most accessible work, \"The Color Before The Sun\" may be a little less compelling thematically but is none the less a killer rock album just the same.\n\nBrimming with positive energy, opening number \"Island\" sets the tone for the nine tracks that follow. In this one song, Sanchez affirms that he is done living in or trying to live up to the past, and the rest of the band appears to be onboard as well. The hard-hitting \"Eraser\" and the haunting \"Ghosts\" fall closer into the typical Coheed wheelhouse, while the ultra-poppy \"From Here To Mars\" and the '80s arena-rock inspired \"You Got Spirit, Kid\" sound more like spin-offs from another universe. \"Atlas,\" a tender ballad about Sanchez's newborn son, stands out as perhaps one of the band's most personal and uplifting numbers, while the oddball closer, \"Peace To The Mountain,\" sums up the spirit of the album perfectly with just the right amount of catharsis and musical liberation.\n\nWhile the purists might turn their nose up at it, anyone who has followed and understood the various detours the band has taken throughout the years (\"Year Of The Black Rainbow,\" anyone?) will likely appreciate what \"The Color Before The Sun\" has to offer. Is it the penultimate Coheed & Cambria album? Absolutely not. Just a nice little detour in an interesting career that will hopefully prove to be a neverender.","classification":4,"fold":3}

Phyllis' vocals are on point throught the entire CD, but the hits song, 'Don't Wanna Change The World', sticks out from the rest of the songs (and not in a good way either!). While it was Phyllis' biggest hit single, it hasn't aged well, and hearing the Diva rap isn't cool at all.\n\nThe rare bonus track recorded during the same sessions, 'Hottest Love Around', was previously available on inported editions of the CD, and is now available on the great 'In Between The Heartaches' compilation, which is also a must have.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"When I saw the first trailer for TRON: Legacy at the beginning of the year I was immediately impressed by the music in it. I then learned the music was indeed the score and then I learned the score was being composed by the French electronic group Daft Punk. Daft Punk is comprised of the duo that is Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel De Homem-Christo. It's not an unusual sight to see artists from the popular music world foraying into films. In fact almost every great composer came from that background.\n\nSo, what was the task at hand here with TRON: Legacy? It was a huge one let me tell you that. Daft Punk had to follow what Wendy Carlos did with the original film. Wendy Carlos is considered to be the mother (or father depending on what time you're talking about) of electronic music. Her score to A Clockwork Orange was revolutionary in a way never thought possible. A decade later she brought her style to TRON. Now fast forward 28 years to today. Daft Punk has delivered a mesmerizing electronic\/orchestral experience that carries the spirit of TRON and will blow you away.\n\nThe score is crafted and structured almost perfectly and never wanders or loses focus. The soundscape is a world on its own for the most part. The \"Overture\" introduces us to the grand theme of the film. The music has an echoing of the brilliant electronic scores of the 70's and 80's. Blade Runner by Vangelis was one that jumped to mind. Now let's talk about that soundscape. Like I said for the most part this score has an identity all of its own. However, there are moments where it slips heavily into the Hans Zimmer realm. Many people are calling it an Inception clone. Is it? Not really. The score does have signature Hans Zimmer elements in it. The score was mixed at Hans Zimmer's studio and the composers do thank Hans Zimmer, Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell in the liner notes of the CD. So it is possible that some of those stylings could have rubbed off on Daft Punk, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Is it a Hans Zimmer score though? Not at all. The style and approach are very unique in their own respect.\n\nThe sounds are grand and vivid just as the visuals are. There is a wondrous enormity to the sound of the whole score. It fills the space from wall to wall with terrific simple melodies. I always say simpler is better. The simpler the sound the larger the emotional effect is. The CD is also expertly arranged. The way the score opens, progresses and closes with a reprisal of the themes is fantastic. \"Flynn Lives\" is quite the track let me tell you and will give you goosebumps. Throughout the whole experience the score swells up and down to create waves of intense and emotionally driven music. It was a fantastic ride and TRON: Legacy is definitely one of the better scores of the year.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"John Mayer is one of the most prolific songwriters, guitarists and performers to have been born in the last 35 years.  His latest album, Born and Raised proves why this isn't an unsubstantiated claim and how his triple-threat talents have given his career such sustainability.\n\nIt's also a \"different\" kind of album from Mayer though it's not an unexpected one.  Simple. At times southern rock and at time folksy, it's at all times the melodic, lyrical genius that is Mayer's trademark.\n\nBrilliantly produced by the legendary Don Was (the Rolling Stones, Bonnie Raitt, B.B. King, Mitch Ryder), this album can be listened to in any environment, for any mood, at any time.  This is because of - not only Mayer's songwriting and performing skills - but for the great people he selected in helping him play on Born and Raised.\n\nOn keys is the legendary keyboardist and Boomerocity friend, Chuck Leavell (Chuck discusses Born and Raised with Boomerocity here); much sought-after drummer, Aaron Sterling; and, on bass, is Sean Hurley who, appropriately enough for this album, formerly toured with Arlo Guthrie.\n\nThree randomly picked favorites (because I love all the songs from Born and Raised) are:\n\nSpeak for Me is one of those songs whose lyrics make you think if not haunt you.  \" . . . and the music on my radio ain't supposed to make me feel alone . . . You can tell that something isn't right when all your heroes are in black and white . . . what a drag to say `At least I still have yesterday . . .\"\n\nSecond choice is the introspective, lonely title song.  While Mayer has obviously written this song in his thirties, the meaning is ageless and the appeal not bound by generations.  This is a brilliant, brilliant song that is surely destined to be one of Mayer fans' favorites.\n\nThe final randomly picked favorite is the mellow, contemplative If I Ever Get Around to Living. Lyrically and melodically captivating, Mayer says, \"If I ever get around to living, It's gonna be just like a I dreamed. I'm gonna take the love I'm given and set it free . . .\".\n\nJohn Mayer fans like me have already bought this CD without needing to listen to it first.  For those looking for an introductory CD of what Mayer is like, you can't go wrong with Born and Raised.  Be warned, though, that you'll need to be prepared to buy his other work to explore other areas of this artist's work.\n\nBoomerocity.com","classification":5,"fold":3}

More like dissa-point-a-dice!\n\nIsn't it somehow a warm and fuzzy story to know that these guys made BIG BUCKS by going soft and less imaginative. You could almost hear a record exec let out a contented \"ahhh\" as he happily recounts \"No more illuminating synth passages and Church organ, it's time to watch the green roll in!\" Although there are some fine moments here, it's not the concise but mystical sounding prog\/hard rock of \"The Grand Illusion\" and \"Pieces of Eight\". If they were a political party they could have had a slogan like \"No more surprises\" or, more to the point, \"No more edginess\".\n\nNot that Styx were ever that 'cutting edge', but at least they hadn't forgotten how to write well-crafted evocative songs, with the gorgeously melodious \"She cares\", the emotive \"The best of times\", the haunting \"Snowblind\" or the closing \"Half-Penny Two-Penny\", which has a prolonged, dramatic finale.\n\nNow if Dennis DeYoung had bothered to add some fantasy synths to give it a less predictable taste, I probably wouldn't bother saying \"I really only give this 3 1\/2 stars\", and wouldn't feel that 4 stars was 'rounding up'.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"I enjoyed 5H's debut EP, 'Better Together'; the music was fun, light, carefree pop - anchored by the ladies fantastic vocals.  It's only natural that I (like other reviewers have stated) was excited about the girls' full-length debut album, 'Reflection'.\n\nAfter seeing numerous delays, [first saying Nov. 2014, then Jan. 2015] (not to mention a majority of \"Harmonizers\" decrying the original album artwork - causing the girls to reshoot the artwork), 'Reflection' finally saw the light of day in Feb. 2015.\n\nHowever, upon listening to 'Reflection', I was slightly disappointed.\n\nIt seems as though the group is going through an identity crisis.  They're trying way too hard to fit into\/appeal to the contemporary R&B\/urban music market.\n\nBy revamping their sound\/image, the girls have abandoned their sound - trading in their sweet harmonizing pop vocals for slick R&B cuts.  Yes, some tracks are fun & catchy, while others (unfortunately) sound like mere filler.\n\nsample lyrics:\n\n\"Do the nae nae\", \"...holla...\" & \"I ain't thirsty fo' no bae\" (\"BO$$\")\n\n\"My booty don't care\" (\"This Is How We Roll\")\n\n\"[hashtag] #iwokeuplikethistoo\" (\"Them Girls Be Like\") - complete with the word \"hashtag\" actually sung in that track!

What happened here?\n\nWhoever is in charge needs to seriously rethink marketing\/management strategies of these young ladies.\n\nNOTE: I'm NOT accusing any artist of \"copying\" off each other; I'm only citing other songs \/artists to give people an idea what the album tracks sound like.*\n\nTrack list \/notes:\n\n1. \"Top Down\" - Definately a girl anthem.  Sounds like a late '90s girl group throwback tune.  Love it!  Definately hearing a Spice Girls vibe here(:\n\n2. \"BO$$\" - it's as though Destiny's Child & The Spice Girls got together & had a love child (not saying the track's bad; it's ok).\n\nAlso doesn't hurt to name-check The First Lady & Oprah all in one (slightly-odd) line: \"Michelle Obama \/ Purse so heavy \/ Gettin' Oprah dollars!\" (huh?)\n\nOn \"BO$$\", Fifth Harmony pays homage to \"girl power!\" anthems by girl groups of the late '90s-early '00s.  \"BO$$\" wouldn't sound terribly out of place on a Destiny's Child album...\n\n3. \"Sledgehammer\" - Deals w\/ sexual tension.  Again, out of 5H's cute-sounding PPP element.  It has weird-sounding music & the lyrics are just plain silly at times.  Seriously, who makes a comparison to a sledgehammer?  Mid-tempo track that sounds sonically reminiscent to Maroon 5's \"Animals\".\n\n4. \"Worth It\" - sounds strikingly similar to Jason DeRulo's \"Talk Dirty To Me\".  This sexually-laden track is a total deviation of the group's pop sound; in fact, it doesn't sound like Fifth Harmony at all :\/. Oh my...\n\n5. \"This Is How We Roll\" - sounds like a slightly sped-up version of \"Shower\" by Becky G.\n\n6. \"Everlasting Love\" - the staccato \"...ever, ever, ever\" sound reminiscent of the opening lines of \"Blank Space\" by Taylor Swift.  Cute tune(:\n\n7. \"Like Mariah\" - a fun, light, breezy, upbeat love tune.  Cleverly samples Mariah Carey's \"Always Be My Baby\".\n\n10. \"Sugar Mama\" - sounds similar to \"Walk Away\" by Paula DeAnda\n\nFavorite tracks:\n\n1. \"Top Down\"\n7. \"Like Mariah\"\n\nIf you're going to purchase\/listen to this album, realize that this is not a true \"reflection\" (no pun intended) of this group's work (the 'Better Together' EP established their sound very nicely).\n\n-Chloe","classification":3,"fold":3}

However, the song played in 1965 or 1967, so the taboo of the times still has to be considered.

{"text":"21 years ago, Shawn Colvin put out an album of cover songs - 'Cover Girl'. It was actually pretty good. She walked the tightrope of doing songs that weren't extremely well known to many people and yet still made them accessible.\n\n21 years later, Shawn Colvin tries to replicate that model - but with less success with the release of 'Uncovered'.\n\nFirst off, I will go on record saying I did not purchase this, but it had been available for full streaming for at least a week prior to the album's release. I've listened to each song multiple multiple multiple times. After her last two mediocre studio albums, I wasn't buying this sight unheard. Not again.\n\nWith 'Cover Girl', I knew about one-third of the songs fairly well, so I had the advantage of not having too many preconceived notions of how the songs had once fared.\n\nWith 'Undercover', I know about 90% of the songs well. This doesn't bode well for Colvin.\n\nWhile I won't say that some of her selections are classics, but to me, they are songs that I love, and some of them that were recorded are not easy to interpret and even less to surpass in greatness. And while I know she's probably working on a shoestring budget, the arrangements and musicians are sparse - leaving too many songs sounding too similar, just in instrumentation.\n\nLet's start with the good:  Colvin does a decent job with Paul Simon's \"American Tune\". It's not Simon, but it is decent.  John Fogerty's \"Lodi\" fares ok. I'm not sure it's an acoustic song, but at least this selection has the most 'band' feel than most of the songs here. Robbie Robertson's \"Acadian Driftwood\" is pretty good.\n\nThe bad: None one could truly touch Neil Finn's \"Private Universe\" and get away with it - for me, that song is too iconic. This includes Shawn. I know Finn is one of her favourite writers, but still, it's ambitious song at best and it doesn't make the mark.  Ditto with Springsteen's \"Tougher Than the Rest\". I'm not fan of Gerry Rafferty's \"Baker Street\" (any version) and I'll give her this, at least there is no annoying saxophone on it like Rafferty's version. I was hoping her rendition would show me that it was indeed a good song, but it just isn't.\n\nAnd there are 10,001 versions of \"Gimme a Little Sign\" out there. And most of them have life attached to them. I know Marc Cohen is on the song, but he's so drowned out, I'm not sure why they bothered having him on.\n\nIf you want a better version of Tammy Wynette's \"Til I Get it Right\", even Tricia Yearwood has one with more heart.  It's a heartbreaking song and Colvin doesn't convey any of the emotion.\n\nAnd that is what is really wrong with this disk - good to great technical readings of each songs, but no emotion, no heart and little warmth. A song evokes a feeling, and unfortunately, too few of these do. She can put forth emotion on her own music, and even with her 'Cover Girl' material, but here it is like going through the motions.","classification":2,"fold":3}

With so much sever overexposure from Beyonce' Knowles, and Rihanna, they are more corporate products than real singers from the heart. Tamia, who has been in music for 20 years, has had such a remarkable voice, but she has not really had been extremely overlooked with her songs like Officially Missing You and You Put A Move On My Heart. She has had such a remarkable voice, but not enough recognition. Her latest song Stuck With You, sounds better than her last work, Sandwich & A Soda, which wasn't a strong song for her heart and caliber. Her voice really drives in the song, and it is one of her better works from start to finish in quite awhile. Tamia is a great singer, but more needs to be done to get her work out there much further.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":3}

Most of their best material from 1967 on is here (except for the dubious inclusion of George Harrison's weak \"Old Brown Shoe\"...I'd rather have replaced it with \"Piggies\" from the \"White Album\" if they had to have a George song).\n\nBe forewarned, though...this is how addicts get started...\n\n4 1\/2 stars","classification":4,"fold":3}

Don't ruin it by listening in snippets.\n\nJust like the movie, I do not want to give anything away in this review.  Be assured I have listened to the entire soundtrack.  I enjoyed this score as much as, if not more than, \"The Social Network\" score.\n\nReznor and Ross have matured on their third outing with Fincher.  From the soft piano halfway through \"Just Like You\", the percussive tone of \"Clue One\", the electronic feel of \"Clue Two\", the piano with synthesizer behind it on \"Background Noise\", \"Procedural\" contains strumming, synth, guitar solo, and some weird sounds yet it never crosses into too much, \"Something Disposable\" sounds like it was recorded using just that, and so on and so on....  This score does what it is supposed to do which is build suspense.  Listening to it on it's own, I feel as though I am in the moments of the film and at the same time am listening to a really good album.  The album has a way of reaching out and grabbing you instead of just being something coming out of your speakers.  There was a lot of emotion put into this project.\n\nTHIS is what scores and soundtracks should all be like.  I wish some of the hacks that score movies will take a lesson from Reznor and Ross.  THIS is how you do scoring!!  This score also proves that the Oscars won by Reznor and Ross for \"The Social Network\" were not a fluke.  I expect this to be nominated for an Oscar and if it isn't I will be shocked.  BUY THIS ALBUM.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Now I'ma start off by saying THIS IS NOT OLD CUBE! So don't go in thinking it is. Yea it has its moments where it has that old school feel, but it's definitely not all the way through.\nOk now that that's out of the way let me say this is a very strong album from Cube. Now all the great legends have either passed away, matured, evolved, or just gotten plain crappy (Snoop) but I feel Cube is still trying to hold his own. He wants this to be like his older material, but that's not possible because everything has changed. There are some tracks that are ehh.... (She Couldn't Make it On Her Own) and then there are some that are like DAMN! (Hood Robbin). Then you have tracks where the beats are bangin' and some where it just doesn't seem like Cube should even be spittin' over it. But over all this is a solid album. The tracks fit together nicely and I don't find the need to skip any tracks because even the sub-par one's are a nice lil change of direction vibe-wise.\nSo if you're a Cube fan then check this out, if not then still give it a chance. Just don't go in preparing to hear \"Death Certificate\" or \"Lethal Injection\" or any of that stuff because YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!\n\nP.S. As of now the track listing is wrong on Amazon.

{"text":"In 2010 the fluorescent-haired girl who just wants to have fun, recorded an album of classic blues songs and even made a DVD of the performances. I love Cyndi and loved that album. Now, shes taking a stab at classic country songs (most made famous in the 1950s and 60s) in the 12 track album co-produced in Nashville with Tony Brown. Without seeing the track list, you can probably guess at least half the songs they chose. Patsy Clines I Fall to Pieces and Walkin After Midnight, Wanda Jacksons The Funnel of Love and (the CDs title song) Detour  with Emmylou Harris on harmony vocal)  and Skeeter Davis The End of The World.  Willie Nelson joins Lauder (and plays guitar) on his Night Life. One really not country song is Carol Halls song from the Broadway musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas  Hard Candy Christmas  but it sortta fits.\n\nThe one song that was definitely new to me is the novelty number Youre the Reason oOur Kids are Ugly which Lauper duets with Vince Gill.\n\nAnyone familiar with Lauper knows that her singing voice is a LOT different than when she speaks (her thick Queens, NY accent ). And, its only during this song  when she and Gill are sharing dialogue  that you really KNOW its Cyndi. No one else sounds like that! But, heck, this is a fun song anyway.\n\nThe CD comes in a digipak with a 12-page color booklet with a 4-page essay by Lauper about the project and a page of song and track credits. No lyrics are provided. (But you probably know them anyway).\n\nLets see, blues in 2010, country in 2016. Whats planned for 2022? Cyndi does opera? Reggae?  Jazz?\n\nI hope you found this review both informative and helpful.\n\nSteve Ramm\nAnything Phonographic","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Call this Drama II if you will, well, maybe not, but because it's another lead singer and doing another album I figured that's a good title.  Well, the bashing has already begun as I knew it would from rabid Yes fans who just can't do without Jon Anderson on vocals.  To be honest, not everything he has sung with Yes is five star either so to give this a bomb of a review based on that is totally unfair.  How many bands have enlisted other lead singers over the years and based on that these groups wouldn't have been - Asia without John Wetton, Bad Company without Paul Rodgers, Foreigner without Lou Gramm, Genesis without Peter Gabriel, Journey without Steve Perry, Marillion without Fish, Spock's Beard without Neal Morse, Van Halen without David Lee Roth.  You get my point, bands change over the years, band members come and they go.  So, the morbid fascination with one particular member and not letting it go - boring.  For this album, great release.  You have to go into this open minded and not expect a Jon Anderson release, period.  If you can past that and just listen to it on its own merits then it's a great listen.  Benoit David does a great job and although he doesn't hit the high notes like Anderson (much like every lead singer after Steve Perry can't hit them either) he still delivers a great album.  Everyone is going to pick this album apart and want to hear 'Tales' or 'Relayer' or 'Fragile'.  Well, if that's what you're looking for don't bother with this release and pop those others into your player and keep listening to them over and over and over, again.  Being familiar with Benoit David from his other group 'Mystery' I can say I enjoy this album.  The opening track is great (although I wish they would have made it one track instead of several - but I Tunes lets you join the tracks so I can listen to it in its entirety in my mix) and I find nothing wrong with it and it's the centerpiece to the album.  If you like this release check out Benoit David's other releases with 'Mystery' entitled 'Beneath the Veil of Winter's Face' and their latest 'One Among the Living'.  With so much garbage out there today in the music industry how can anyone complain about this and there isn't any way it deserves a one star rating.  I give it between 4 and 5 stars and do really wish they would have clocked it up to the 80 minute mark which shouldn't have been difficult to do, especially after having to wait 10 years for new music from this supergroup.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Since their first album didn't exactly take the U.S. by storm, I wasn't too surprised to hear that their sophomore effort leans much more on the pop side of pop punk, with the first three songs in particular crafted to do well on the Singles Charts.  Still, a good portion of this record will remind you of the first, and Boys Like Girls mix things up even more this time around with a few songs that try to connect with listeners on a deeper level.\n\nAs mentioned, the first three songs use every trick in the production book to come up with some extremely catchy tunes.  \"Heart Heart Heartbreak\" combines what sounds like portions of The Scorpions' \"Rock You Like A Hurricane\" and Bon Jovi's \"You Give Love A Bad Name\" with plenty of trendy vocal effects to have you singing along quickly.  Likewise, \"Love Drunk\" and \"She's Got A Boyfriend Now\" use the latest favorite drum machine and synth sounds along with plenty of background \"Whoah, Ohahs\" and \"Heys\" to be as current as possible in the pop department, and I must say the results are sure to achieve their intended results...I'd be surprised if this record doesn't sell better than the first.  Even if you don't like this style, the good news is that no matter how these songs are produced, you still get frontman Martin Johnson's late '90's rock stylings, both vocally and melodically, scattered throughout the album.\n\n\"Two Is Better Than One\", featuring Taylor Swift, is the first of four songs that use a simple (but effective) approach in an attempt to move listeners emotionally...acoustic guitar, strings, real drums and a slight country flavor make this song one of the album's highlights.  Martin's vocals blend nicely with Taylor's, and there's a down-to-earth quality about this song that really makes it beautiful...at least it does for me.  A couple of somewhat straightforward BLG rockers are up next, with \"Contagious\" sounding like its beat is based on Toni Basil's \"Hey Micki (She's So Fine)\", and \"Real Thing\", which also starts itself off with classic '80s rock riffs in the verse before heading into a more conventional BLG chorus.\n\n\"Someone Like You\" is another one of the simply arranged, slower songs with good melody and lyrics (\"Running from Jesus\", \"Fighting My Demons\" in the chorus) that I find myself gravitating towards...this is a side of the band I'm really liking.  Another decent rocker follows (\"The Shot Heard 'Round The World), with fresh enough melodies and chord progressions that it doesn't sound too much like any other song, and for some reason starts off with several seconds of the sounds of heavy breathing.\n\nI really like \"The First One\", a mid tempo, melodic tune about your first broken heart being the worst, even though it isn't necessarily very original.  Some songs sound like they would fit well on the debut album, like \"Chemicals Collide\".\nFinally, \"Go\" uses acoustic guitar, cello and other string instruments along with interesting percussion as a backdrop to the final poignant, stripped-down but beautifully melodic piece of this record (ending as an instrumental).  Overall, there's a lot to like here, even as this album is less rock and more pop.","classification":4,"fold":3}

Shortly after the mixtape, he was sought after and signed by the independent label Visionary Music Group. After the succesful mixtape triolgy \"Young Sinatra\" (\"Young Sinatra\", \"Undeniable\" and \"Welcome To Forever\"), he recieved press from the likes of Billboard and XXL- with the latter putting him on the cover for their annual \"Top Ten Freshemen List\". A few months after the cover, he was signed to Def Jam Recordings by producer\/A&R executive No I.D. (Best known for his work with Common, Jay-Z and Kanye West).  Since recording the album for nearly a year, Logic finally released his major label debut \"Under Pressure\" at the end of October 2014.\n\nWhat's noticeable about \"Under Pressure\" is the huge influence that rappers like Drake and Kendrick Lamar had over the album- despite Logic's allegiances to groups like OutKast and A Tribe Called Quest  (The skits between his songs are an obvious tribute to Tribe's 1993 album \"Midnight Marauders\"). The Drake and Kendrick Lamar comparisons are inevitable, but what sets Logic apart from them is the instrospection and candor in his songs- a theme that's fairly constant in the recording. Logic and his longtime producer 6ix handle the bulk of the album, with additional production from Strange Fruit Project's Symbolyc One, Austrailian beatmaker M-Phazes and DJ Khalil. He expresses thoughts on his career on \"Intro\", \"Never Enough\" and \"Metropolis\", while speaking on his difficult upbringing on \"Soul Food\". He celebrates his current position in life on \"I'm Gone\" and records the third installment of the maturity themed \"Growing Pains\". He has conflicting emotions toward smoking on \"Nikki\" and speaks from his own point of view as well as his parents on the nine minute title track \"Under Pressure\". Lastly, he traces his start from humble beginnings to getting a recording contract on \"Till The End\". \"Under Pressure\" is a great album from newcomer Logic. Despite the criticisms toward him, he crafted a well-produced and introspective freshman effort. The question that now remains is will Def Jam get behind him? There's only one way to find out.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"As a person who thinks Family Guy is overrated and a very hit and miss show (in other words, I'm not a huge Seth MacFarlane fan), I looked at this CD and said \"he's got to be kidding\".\n\nWell, this CD is actually quite good.  Seth's voice is very, very good.  As Family Guy fans know, he does most of the voices for that show, and he also sings on Family Guy's musical numbers.  Recording a CD like this isn't that far of a jump for him, but to do one with great sincerity and to do it very well is impressive.  The band behind Seth is first class with great arrangements.  He even recorded the album\/CD in the old studios where Sinatra recorded, and even used a special mike that they used back in the old days (the mike specifications elude me at the moment).\n\nWhen TV\/film stars venture into singing territory, the results can be either mediocre (like Hugh Laurie's recent attempt at New Orleans blues), or a complete disaster (William Shatner's \"singing\" comes to mind).  Seth doesn't fall into that trap at all.  So while I'm still not much of a Family Guy fan, I really like this CD.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"A member of one of the most famous families from Bohemia, Franz Benda (1709-1789) entered into the service of Frederick the Great in 1732. As a violin master, he played some 50,000 performances over a forty year period. He also wrote a lot of violin music, 110 solo capriccios, at least 150 sonatas, 31 duets and some 28 concertos, including this one in D Major.\n\nWith a crisply articulated intro, the Allegro ma non molto features a harpsichord continuo and string dominated orchestral support. As a transitional work from the Baroque, it contains more interplay between the single violin and the symphonic tutti than was the norm for the prevalent Italian style. Smoothly flowing, Bendas writing for the solo string is virtuosic without being showy, letting the melodic lines develop naturally. In the minor keyed Largo, the sweep of the orchestral accompaniment lends a somber weight to the throbbing vibrato of Gabriela Demeterova. With a dramatic pathos in the uppermost register, she brings a sorrowful sweetness in her tone that must be similar to the reported quality that set apart Bendas adagio playing. Horns appear for the brisk finale, a bright Allegro with bravura fiddling as the single violin drifts high on the E string.\n\nA generation or two later, Bohemian born Vaclav Pichl (1741-1805) studied philosophy and theology in Prague before accepting a musical directorship in Milan. After 21 years, he returned to Vienna and died while playing a violin concerto at the Lobkowitz Palace.\nHis D Major Concerto Op. 3, No. 1 opens with a marching Allegro sostenuto, clipped and precise. While still employing the harpsichord as continuo, the writing finds even greater collaboration between the soloist and orchestra, engaging in extensive rhythmic interactions and trading melodic ideas, including one haunting echo in minor. A higher degree of technical proficiency of the single violin is also required.\n\nA minor keyed charmer, the following Adagio finds striking support in the lower strings with a lovely countermelody while the ethereal vibrato of the solo sounds so much like the beating of angel wings. Ending the 2nd movement on an open cadence sets up a smooth transition as the resolution occurs in the sweetly pure tones from the violin, the very first notes of the concluding Rondo. Interrupting the relentless drive in the lower strings, a brief passage in minor offers a dark interlude in an otherwise cheery finale.\n\nBy another Bohemian, the final concerto represents the culmination of the Viennese High Classical style. Renowned as a teacher and violin virtuoso, Antonin Vranicky (1761-1820) composed some outstanding chamber music and challenging concertos, one of which is the C Major included on this recording.\n\nUsing tympani and winds to create a broader palette of orchestral colors, the work begins with a bold Allegro giusto. Amid a longer, more extensive development section, the soloist shines in the fiendishly difficult passage work while in the reverential Adagio that follows, the writing stretches the upper reaches of the instruments register. After a chorale like start, the weeping violin carries the movement until gentle horns lead to a serene close. Marked Alla Pollacca- Allegretto, the finale is a frisky Polish folk dance. With an appealing stutter step in the rhythm, this 3rd movement features a brief mournful interlude, dazzling flourishes from the violin and a rousing finish.\n\nThe original recording from 1995 from Supraphon is fine, placing the solo violin close enough for the intimate slower sections to be sharp and clear. Under the able artistic direction of Milan Lajcik, the Prague Chamber Orchestra brings an accomplished reading to their fellow countrymens concertos. But the spotlight rightfully belongs to the exquisite work of Gabriela Demeterova. This fine traversal of the development of the Viennese violin concerto is testimony to her artistry.","classification":5,"fold":3}

Like the previous collection, these remakes generally follow the arrangements and sound of the originals, but anyone familiar with the hit recordings will quickly notice differences. Most notably the vocalists haven't the youthful tone of their earlier years, and though the productions are of good quality, these simply haven't the magic of hit singles.\n\nWorse for this second helping, the producers have loosened their grip on the concept of \"one hit wonder.\" B.J. Thomas had two #1s and a dozen Top 40s, and the Diamonds had fifteen charting singles, including a second #1 with \"The Stroll.\" Lynn Anderson and Faron Young were major country music stars whose limited crossover hits might quality them as pop one-hit wonders, except that Anderson had six singles on the pop chart, and Young scored much higher with \"Hello Walls\" (#12) than \"It's Four in the Morning,\" which stalled at #72 on the pop chart.\n\nThere are some bona fide one-hit wonders here in Eddie Holman, Bob Lind, Jewel Akens, Sheb Wooley, Ned Miller, Caravelles, and Bob Luman, but for the most part their hit recordings weren't licensed. Akens' \"The Birds and the Bees\" could be the real thing, as might be a few others, but without a trusted copy of the originals at hand, it's hard to really know. And that's exactly the problem with a collection like this: re-makes blur the historical record and leave listeners wondering if they're hearing the actual artifact or a smartly produced copy. Or in the case of Joe South's \"Games People Play,\" Mary Wells' \"My Guy\" and Santo & Johnny's \"Sleep Walk,\" not-so-smartly-produced copies. With most the original recordings of these hits readily available, there's no reason to accept substitutes.\n\nIf you want to hear the real thing check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Barry-Williams-Presents-One-Hit-Wonders-of-the-70s\/dp\/B000F3AJXA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Barry Williams Presents: One-Hit Wonders of the 70s<\/a>, which includes original hit recordings of many of the titles featured here.

{"text":"The pointblank outpouring of the feminine soul - in a state of anguish & mourning - receives its full measure in this exceptional classic \"Un-break My Heart\"; sung with truly unique voice inflections & intonations by Toni Braxton; composed & written by Diane Eve Warren. We hear our heroine pleading for and commanding her deceased or departed lover to return to her immediately to assauge her loss and hurt, \"Don't leave me in all this pain, Don't leave me out in the rain...\" The use of the imperative is so forceful and direct, it heightens the emotional impact of the song, and renders us as wrung out with emotional catharsis - as she is.\n\nBraxton's soft, silky utterances easily immerse the listener in the strength and power of her heavier vocal chords - when she pours it on, \"Say you'll love me again, Undo this hurt you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life; Un-cry these tears, I cried so many nights...Un-break my heart!\" The excellent video for this song with its dramatic intensity lifts this rendition into being scene- and plot-driven, like \"Mourning Becomes Electra\" with the lights turned down.\n\nThis in turn builds plot and 'grief' motif within 'surround sound' orchestration. Braxton's intensity, her passionate request for her lover to return - becomes one of the more powerful crescendos in pop music. This would not be so - if her lips were sealed - they had to be un-sealed - her depth of expression from deep within her soul - may cause us to grieve (our catharsis, her purge of emotion). We listen to her final refrain and empathize with her loss. It is quite satisfying if not exhausting. We hope to be drenched in her emotional denouement upon re-playing this cinematic song. It is yours to enjoy when the mood is right.\n\n\"Bring back the nights when I held you beside me\nUn-break my heart\nSay you'll love me again\nUndo this hurt you caused\nWhen you walked out the door\nAnd walked out of my life\nUn-cry this tears\nI cried so many, many nights\nUn-break my\nUn-break my heart oh baby\nCome back and say you love me\nUn-break my heart\nSweet darlin'\nWithout you I just can't go on\nCan't go on....\"","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"KC & The Sunshine Band created some really great music during those disco days; and this music helps to bring back many fond memories. As other reviewers have written, there are more comprehensive retrospectives out there than just these tracks; but for the casual fan like me this is really great!\n\nHere we get nothing but five star quality! \"Get Down Tonight\" sports that funky 1970s disco beat with some great sound effects; the drums, percussion and electric guitars come in to carry the bulk of the melody. The band sings to the funky melody to make this a memorable tune! \"I'm Your Boogie Man\" has some great percussion and H. W. \"KC\" Casey sings this straight out of the ballpark! Love that disco beat and the backup chorus on \"I'm Your Boogie Man,\" too!\n\nOne of the band's greatest hits comes next, \"(Shake Shake Shake) Shake Your Booty.\" This ode to dancing and having fun for the sake of having fun has a very catchy melody; and they don't leave any doubt that they're encouraging romantic times as well! \"That's The Way (I Like It)\" has a great female backup chorus; and \"KC\" Casey sings this to perfection. This is one song that has a rhythm and beat that you just can't fight!\n\n\"Keep It Comin' Love\" starts with some really fine electric guitar; and when they start singing this number takes off like a rocket! That infectiously happy disco beat will catch you yet. \"Please Don't Go\" gives us a song in a whole new genre; this time the band sings a slower paced number. \"KC\" Casey and the backup vocalists sing so well about wanting their lover not to leave them; and the percussion enhances the natural beauty of this love ballad. \"Wrap Your Arms Around Me\" is more of that disco flavored style of music; the vocalists harmonize to perfection and I love that beat!\n\nThe other great numbers are \"Sound Your Funky Horn;\" \"Queen of Clubs;\" \"Boogie Shoes\" with that awesome beat; \"Let's Go Rock and Roll;\" \"Give It Up\" that I really like; \"Do You Wanna Go Party\" with them handling complex tempo and key changes effortlessly; \"I Like To Do It;\" \"Shotgun Shuffle\" and the awesome closing track, \"All I Want.\"\n\nHarry Wayne \"KC\" Casey and the Sunshine Band certainly had more than just a day or two in the sun; and we are better off for their terrific tunes. It's also good to know that we can still enjoy their music today. If you're a die-hard fan, I would suggest that you consider a more thorough retrospective than just these tracks. For the casual fan, however, this music is absolutely awesome!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I am not really a big Rob Zombie fan. Casual fan would be a better listener but I have always liked whatever songs I would hear on the song or saw on tv as a solo artist or when he was with White Zombie. I always liked his fusion of metal and industrial music. He also knew how to write a good hook to attract fans.\n\nOn a casual whim, I decided to pick up Rob's new album \"Educated Horses\". In general, \"Educated Horses\" is no \"Hellbilly Deluxe\" (my favorite Zombie album) but it still very good. I wasn't too keen on the slower tracks but songs like \"American Witch\" and \"Foxy Foxy\" reminds me why I have always liked Rob's music. His music is incredibly melodic yet he manages to maintain an aggressive metal\/industrial edge to please those who like heavy, aggressive music. I especially love \"American Witch\". I have to listen to it as loud as I can. It is the closest thing to classic Zombie like \"Dragula\". As I have said before I wasn't keen on the slower songs. I prefer it when Rob growls than actually sings. My other beef with the cd is that it clocks under 40 minutes. A bit short for my taste. Overall \"Educated Horses\" is a lot of fun I think, especially when it is cranked up on the stereo.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"\"Hypocrite\" has really eerie guitar work and psychedelic early Pink Floyd-like vocals.  This pop song is quite creepy and well-written.  You'll be able to remember the catchy verse melody.  I enjoy the lyrics.  \"Digging My Lawn\" has a jazzy, upbeat rhythm with more early Floyd-like playfulness about a man digging Giles lawn, haha!  \"Tremelo Study In A Major\" is an instrumental with appealing... banjo work?  Sure sounds like it to me.  It speeds along in a swift way.  \"Newly Weds\" is basically the same as \"Digging My Lawn\"- very memorable vocal melody.  \"Suite No. 1\" is a short burst of fast-moving and melodic guitar work before the song quickly changes somber and completely different from the first half of the tune.  You'll be able to subtly detect Fripp's genius here.\n\n\"Scrivens\" is a beautiful flute\/sax instrumental with a jazzy rhythm.  \"Make It Today\" has jazzy upbeat female and male vocals and Fifth Dimension-like \"Aquarius\" vocals with more sax and flutes.  So far I love this album!  \"Digging My Lawn\" is basically the same as the other version- still a great pop song.  \"Why Don't You Just Drop In\" has pounding piano work based around pop vocal hooks and surprising Brian Wilson-like mannerisms in the middle.  The guitar solo is pretty crunchy too.  \"I Talk to the Wind\" is arguably superior to the King Crimson tune.  At least this early 1968 version sounds more appropriate as a light shorter pop song (at least in my opinion).  Nothing against the classic In the Court of the Crimson King version of course, which is also excellent.  This version sounds slightly more upbeat and to the point which I guess just feels more appropriate to me.\n\n\"Under the Sky\" has tender vocals very reminiscent of Annie Haslam of Renaissance fame.  A very sad, softly sung tune that sort to reminds of \"You're Only as Pretty as You Feel\" the Jefferson Airplane tune.  \"Plastic Pennies\" has more female vocals, this time with an upbeat and happier melody with innocent lyrics about children playing.  Expect a flute solo at the end too.  Good song.  \"Passages of Time\" is a creepy psychedelic-tinged song with more female vocals.  This lady reminds me so much of Annie Haslam it's not even funny.  Or is it funny?  No it's not!  This version of \"Under the Sky\" doesn't sound particularly different from the other version except for some of the guitar playing being more obvious.\n\n\"Murder\" trades female and male vocals back and forth which is especially cool in the intro- \"Murder, murder, Murdeeeeeeer!\" Otherwise a silly but vocal melody-appealing pop tune with strong psychedelic leanings.  \"I Talk to the Wind\" features female vocals this time and actually once again I prefer *both* versions of this classic song compared to the more famous King Crimson version.  Like the above version, this type of song just feels more appropriate as a shorter pop song with the psychedelic dreaminess.  \"Erudite Eyes\" begins with more early Pink Floyd-like upbeat\/jazzy vocals before soon dissolving into a guitar\/flute jam that's somewhat disjointed but mostly memorable.  This jam does remind me of King Crimson's more messier jams from the early In the Court\/Wake of Poseidon days.\n\n\"Make It Today\" is like the other version but with an extended sax\/jazzy guitar jam in the middle and again at the end.  You know this song actually has serious FM hit potential due to the 60's-ish good time vibes.  It should have been a popular tune.  \"Wonderland\" has a blend of female and male vocals that don't necessarily appeal to me but they're alright I suppose.  The vocal style temporarily changes in the second half to a more appealing one.  \"Why Don't You Just Drop In\" is perhaps better than the other version due to Fripp's guitar playing and what strikes me as cleaner production but I could be wrong about that.  The album finally ends on a VERY high note with the Brian Wilson-inspired \"She Is Loaded\".  This is one of the best written songs on the album in my opinion.  Maybe others feel differently.  \"She used to give me anything I wanted until she won a football pool\".\n\nOverall well for King Crimson fans certainly don't expect lengthy multi-part progressive rock original instrumental work that nowadays people consider legendary, and also don't expect Fripp's guitar brilliance to be showcased unless you listen attentively for it.  Treat the Brondesbury Tapes as a pop album with heavy psychedelic vocals combined with jazzy arrangements.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"This is the first album from Rich Gang, which consists of Young Money and Cash Money. With limited features from the \"stars\" of the label, will the newer artists step up to the plate? Nicki and Wayne are featured on one song a piece and Drake isn't on any of them. Birdman says the reason he isn't on the album is because he's working on his new album plus he says Drake is on some new tracks that's being saved for the upcoming Big Tymers album. But anyway, the album starts with R.G., Birdman speaks on the intro, while the \"Man Right Chea\" Mystkal drops a energetic verse and you already know he's gonna bring the energy whenever he gets on the mic. Future and Detail  link up on piano driven \"Million Dollar\", which is basically a short song leading into the first single \"Tapout\". You've heard the song by now, you know how it goes \"She got that million dollar ooh ooh ooh!\".\n\nMMG leader Rick Ross has a solo joint, \"50 Plates\". Can anyone predict the outcome of this song? Trap beat, chanty hook, yup its the same formula Rozay has been using since his hit single BMF. Ok I admit I do enjoy the song though Lol. Its that workout music. \"Panties To The Side\" featuring French Montana, Tyga, Bow Wow & Gudda Gudda is for the strip clubs, can't be mad at the song. I can't see it getting played on radio or anything, but in the clubs it definitely can. \"100 Favors\" is enjoyable, Kendrick Lamar easily steals the show with his quick story about a girl.  R Kelly appears on \"We Been On\", so when did him and Birdman squash that beef they had? Remember they were supposed to put the Best Of Both Worlds 2 album in 03, then Kellz ditched him to record the sequel with Jay? Am I the only noticed Kelly sang the hook similar to how J Cole did on Power Trip?\n\n\"Dreams Come True\" featuring Yo Gotti, Ace Hood, Mack Maine & Birdman and \"Bigger Than Life\" featuring Chris Brown, Tyga, Birdman & Lil Wayne are the strong points of the album. Birdman is a very smart businessman, he knew exactly what he was doing by inserting himself into the \"Pop\" oriented \"Sunshine\", which features Limp Bizkit, Flo-Rida, Birdman & Caskey. This is my first time hearing of Caskey, but he is signed to the label.  The song has a positive vibe to it. They might as well push it as a single. \"Everyday\" featuring Cory Gunz, Birdman, Mystikal & Busta Rhymes is your typical Cash Money track and a very forgettable one at that. No need to waste your hard earned money on this one. After listening to this, I must say this comp will not advance any of their careers, Cash Money was better off releasing it as free mixtape instead.\n\nThe \"Number 1 Stunna\" is on damn near every song. How about letting someone else shine? It should be called Birdman & Friends, because that's the type of feel I got from it. Some other things I wanna touch on, in my opinion Jae Millz and Cory Gunz have been  disappointments since signing to Young Money, they were supposed to be apart of the \"New New York\" around that 2004\/2005 era with Papoose, Saigon, Joell Ortiz, Stack Bundles (Rip), Etc. They need to find an identity. As far as Detail goes, it seems like he has been studying Future's formula, relying on the sing songy auto-tune flow, but he made the most out of the opportunity he was given. Overall, Rich Gang is very average, nothing more nothing less.","classification":3,"fold":3}

I also didn't find the video to be as appealing, where Pink is just like one of the desperate housewives, where she tries to seduce her lover, and then kill her all at once. I really wasn't drawn into the song, it just didn't have the zing that her other songs like Stupid Girls, Family Portrait and Get This Party Started showed from her.

But my favorites are on here, from Got To Be There, I Want You Back, Shake Your Body, Blame It On The Boogie, Off The Wall, Beat It, Billie Jean, In The Closet, Remember The Time, Another Part Of Me, Bad, Dirty Diana(the hummable song), Smooth Criminal, Dangerous, and You Rock My World. The sound's a little loud, but I think they wanted a full, complete listening experience to the listener.  The packaging said 37 songs, but there are 38 songs here, and what a spectacular collection of Michael's hits. I know there are people saying, \"But why isn't Butterflies or State Of Shock on here?\"  It must have been tough deciding what to put on here, because Michael has always made quality music.  To Usher, Justin Timberlake, Omarion and the top singers\/dancers, you are all great artists, but you need 20 more years or so in the business to catch up to the greatness and artistry of Michael Jackson! Keep working at it! I could play these CDs all night long because all my favorites are on here! Can you hear those funky beats and rhythms in the distance when you hear this album going down an interstate for 100-170 miles or so on a road trip?  This is yet another great compilation album of Michael's hits, probably better than 2003's Number Ones. Get multiple copies to send to your family members and friends!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"50 Cent's 2nd album \"Get Rich or Die Trying\" is worthy of all the hype surronding it. Finally 50 has got the backing (Aftermath\/Shady), and the beats needed to make an excellent album. 50 has come a long way since \"How to Rob\", remember first hearing him on \"In Too Deep Soundtrack\" and I knew then he would blow one day. Underground for a long time, nice to see him drop an album commerically, and see that he hasn't sold out on anything. Executive Produced by Dr. Dre and Eminem, with guest appearances coming from Em, G-Unit members- Young Buck, Tony Yayo and Lyoyd Banks, and the king of sick R&B hooks Nate Dogg. Ninteen tracks total including intro and 3 bonus tracks. Standout tracks for me at the moment are: \"Patiently Waiting\" Feat. Eminem, \"Many Men\", lead single \"In Da Club\", \"High All the Time\", \"If I can't\" and the relaxed banging \"21 Questions\" feat. Nate Dogg\" and the adrenaline laced \"Gotta Make it to Heaven\". The 3 bonus tracks \"Wanksta\" (8 Mile soundtrack), \"U Not Like Me\" and \"Life's on the Line\" close off the album well.

{"text":"Another 5 star collection filled with so many highlights, Bonnie Raitt and her band continue to master so many styles of American music and on DIG IN DEEP, she delivers the goods.  Start to finish this is a collection that gets you moving with so many grooves and textures and Bonnie takes charge and shapes these lyrics into deeply emotional sonic gems. From blues-rock to ballads, funk to soul shaking R&B, to straight out rock, she's got plenty to sing about on Dig in Deep. I really like the way she's taken the INXS 80's hit \"Need you tonight\" and gives it such a sensual charm and her slide guitar work make this a standout.  The political rocker \"The coming round is going through\" is a great Rolling Stones style Raitt original, \"Undone\" written by Bonnie Bishop is another beautiful ballad that Raitt just wraps her vocals around and owns. \"All alone with something to says\", another standout track that would make an excellent AC hit. Love the feel, music and lyrics to \"I Knew\", the rockin Los Lobos \"Shakin Shakin Shakes\"  guitar duels with Bonnie and George a welcome change of pace, the Joe Henry penned \"You've changed my mind\" ...The blues rocking first single about life on the never ending road \"Gypsy in Me\"...  \"Dig in Deep\" is so full of emotional journeys, none more than the closer \"The One's we couldn't be\" another Raitt original of the 5 she's written or co-wrote, just a devastating reality put to song.  All these songs are powerful statements to Bonnie Raitt's long run in the business and  her love for finding just the right songs. Dig in Deep is sure to be talked about when the best of the year comes around later this year.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Amy Winehouse is gone. The news is sad for many reasons, but it does drive us back to our CD collection to reevaluate her gifts - and they were extraordinary. This CD plus DVD album is probably her best known and certainly the number of Grammy Awards would indicate that. Just the lead song 'Rehab' is worth the price of the recording.\n\nWinehouse created a sensation both in the musical world with what was indelibly her own style. Many of us felt at first like this was another Janis Joplin, not only in her committed delivery but also in her drug abusive life. It seems like every generation has a wounded sparrow - Edith Piaf, Billie Holiday, Janis Joplin. And like those who came before her she was as much a star off stage as she was on stage. Now at age 27 she is gone, but with songs such as Rehab, You Know I'm No Good, Just Friends, Back To Black, Love Is A Losing Game and Tears Dry On Their Own her memory will live on. She was a one of a kind for this generation and it is difficult to say goodbye. Grady Harp, July 11","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"This is really the biggest surprise of the year thus far. I mean, this girl comes off the American Idol of England, comes to the states, and this song comes out of nowhere building radio play all the way to #1. What's the secret? Apparently America just loves those female R&B Love Song vibes.\n\nLeona Lewis herself has a rather good voice, and carries herself pretty well throughout the song. The song itself is pretty darn standard in the R&B Love Song genre, so it could be sung by Mariah, or any artist in that mold for that matter. No ground is broken, but it is a nice listen, and so far, it has not annoyed me to death, so that's always a positive.\n\nSo overall, nothing brilliant, nothing new, but Leona Lewis seems to nice enough to be let on my radio dial. And, even though this might be saying much, this song might be better than most of Mariah's work, since her stuff is so overly done, it's pathetic. It's also a nice change of pace that Leona isn't practically begging her lover to touch her body like another certain artist has done. ;)","classification":4,"fold":3}

This version is slower and longer than the version from the TV show featured on the Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer soundtrack. But this version is still up tempo and very well sung. Unfortunately too many artists ruin this song by trying to make their renditions too much their own. Dean Martin refers to Rudolph as \"Rudy\" in a few lines of the song and Jewel performs this song in a horribly slow and dragged out manner.

I seriously doubt there could be found one in several thousand voices that are as gifted as these young men.\nI have never been disappointed with one song they have put on a CD,  until now.  On this album there are 4 songs that do a complete injustice to their one in a million abilities. 'Angel',  'Little Things', 'Maria', and to a somewhat lesser extent 'Can you Feel the Love Tonight'. Quite simply these songs are not big, grand, sweeping enough in voice range for Il Volo's voices, period.\nWho decided these songs, so unworthy of these young men's talent, should be offered on this album. As a super fan I am saddened by how these songs make these gifted voices sound like, well, no talent.  What an insult to Piero, Ignazio and Gianluca's  epic talents , they have a talent that can be compared with only a small fraction of all the best singers that have ever lived, and they should not be singing songs that hide their superb voices.\n\nThese big voices need big, grand songs. I realize they are wanting to reach a younger audience , their songs, We are Love, their version of Beautiful Day, and on this album Surrender showcase their talent and reach the audience they are more in tune with.\n\nDo not compromise your talent Il Volo, what you gain will not be worth what you stand to lose in the long run.","classification":4,"fold":3}
{"text":"I've already started seeing on more recent best of albums lists compiled by renowned music critics where this album is among the top 10 albums of all time along with albums by the Stones and the Beatles and I for one am not surprised.  This album is synonymous with an entire genre that it helped to create and with Kurt Cobain's demise, the demise of grunge was quick to follow.  The man despite his attempts at escaping the fact was a musical genius.  Many musicians, myself included, would have loved to have his great sense of melody and intuitive knowledge of how best to use dynamics i.e. the alternation of loud and harsh with slow and soft to create maximum aural impact.  Kurt had a great songwriting gift and he was able to put all the angst and frustrations he felt so eloquently down on track after track on this album.\n\nThis version of the album is a treat for fans as it comes in a mini-lp replica sleeve a.k.a. mlps design which although isn't the best I've seen however contains a bizarre mini 2008 calendar covering just the months of March and April, an inner sleeve that faithfully represents the original lp design and a booklet of 12 pages containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  Most importantly, the sound quality is very good as well and there is a bit of a surprise on the last track which is actually more than 20 minutes long as after a long pause at the end of \"Something in the Way\" we get a few minutes of outtakes with Kurt going even more mental than anything you've heard on any of the earlier tracks which I thought was interesting.\n\nThis is a must have album for any self respecting music lover's cd library and is destined to become consistently recognised as an all-time classic album.\n\nVery highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":3}

Moreover, I have four different versions with  Casals.\n\nI would say this is probably, the most intimate and serene of the four versions I have. The dream team was Isaac stern and Alexander Schneider first and second violins, Milton Katims viola and Casals and Tortellier first and second cellos respectively. It's to say half Budapest quartet (Katims and Schneider), Stern whose prodigious career was increasing and Paul Tortellier a true legend of the instrument.\n\nAll of them achieved a memorable musical feat through this hypnotic performance, whose penetrating lyricism and absorbing quietness carved in relief. The quality sound (keeping in mind it was recorded in 1952, was surprisingly good).\n\nIn which concerns Schubert's Fifth Symphony, this is the first release. Due multiple motives, this recording was found in the archives of Prades and this finding was fortunate. The approach given to the Mozartian First movement and the heavenly inspiration of the Second movement is unbelievable. In spite of being Kertesz' interpretation with the Vienna the most radiant and engaging that I know, this musical document from 1953, is an invaluable musical document, absolutely essential for all hard music lover.\n\nExtraordinary musical treasure.","classification":5,"fold":3}

She is a unique combination of a mature talented singer  and a sweet 12 year old girl all wrapped up in one. When she sings she puts her whole being into the music. Some people will not care for her music and that is OK. There is a lot of music I don't care for. What Jackie does is more than entertain. She lifts the spirit and inspires. I have both her CD (from Amazon) and the CD\/DVD combo available only from Target. If you get a chance, please watch the DVD. I am looking forward to seeing her in person in Dallas on November 14, 2012. As far as the selections on this CD, they have done a wonderful job of mixing older tunes with newer ones. Also, I love the piece where Jackie sings with her brother! The piece with The Tenors is very powerful! Finally, as a Phantom fan, I was glad Jackie performed the Music of the Night. If jackie ever reads these reviews, I want to thank her for lighting up my life with her music!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Around the time this album came out, most people were probably thinking, \"What has happened to Alice Cooper?\" or \"What is Alice Cooper thinking?\"  After he tried to reinvent himself for the 80s with Flush The Fashion, I think many people abandoned him for the cruddy new bands that started popping up.  The punk sound that he hinted at with Flush The Fashion and carried on with on Special Forces is still in play here.  This could actually be part 2 to Special Forces minus the ... attitude.  Alice uses this album to totally let loose his humor side with mixed results.  It's really not as funny as Alice thinks it is.  That's not to say I don't enjoy it, I do.  I actually like this album quite a bit.  I think it's great that he tried something different regardless of what people think.  The only flaw in my eyes is that it seems as though Alice Cooper-the man was taking a vacation from Alice Cooper-the character.  All of us fans fell in love with the creepy character of Alice Cooper, and this album comes across as an album by the man and not the character.  Look at his picture on the cover.  Yes, it is funny, but \"Alice Cooper\" wouldn't do something like that, or make an album of songs like that either.  Same can be said for Special Forces(though I can see the outfit working, but not the lyrics), or Flush The Fashion(where I can see the songs working but not the image).  This may sound like I'm putting these three albums down, but I really like and listen to them quite a bit.  This little known \"weird\" period of Alice's(Flush, Forces, Zipper, Dada) is very underrated if you ask me, and should be given alot more credit and attention than it does.  It's sad that the \"Trash\" period is more well known and favored.  I know this review won't be read by many because of that, and it's only hardcore Alice Cooper fans that will take any interest in this album at all.  And since that's the case, you already own it or you're eventually gonna get it and were curious about it....It'll be one step closer to having the whole collection, and you just may be surprised that it's actually a good album.  Different(it's no Love It To Death), but good nonetheless. ...","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Faith no more have been one of my favorite bands for more than twenty years now. Their different musical style and the way Mike Patton is as a performer and singer is nothing short of mind blowing! They hand influenced countless bands, also been ripped off my countless bands that have gotten the credit they deserve. But anyway that's water under the bridge. Back from a eighteen year hiatus ( I think?). Right where their last album left off ( Album of the year) they release their comeback album Sol Invictus. The album is in every way faith no more sounding. To the crushing metal riffs, to the weird growning and screaming to the tiny beautiful whisper of Patton. To songs and sounds you wouldn't expect, but you never know what to expect on a faith no more album. Blending so many different kinds of music in their band sometimes in the same song. To me though this album reminds me a lot of their last album (album of the year) but without repeating their selves and moving into new territory. Mike Patton still singing into sort of a deep baritone voice almost on certain songs doing a talk over on certain parts, while sort of changing his voice into the quiet whisper mike Patton is famous for. The production and guitar work remind me album of the year. But there's a mixture of all their albums on certain songs. Certain songs could fit perfectly on Angel Dust, while others could fit on The Real Thing or King For a Day fool for a lifetime. Great album though. Grows on you the more you listen to it. Still has the warped genius of faith no more on it.","classification":4,"fold":3}

It has been a decade since she broke out as a actress with The Princess Diaries with Julie Andrews. But for her role in Les Miserables, she had to really deliver in music. For her rendition of I Dreamed A Dream, she had to make her own, without being too much, especially with all the times we've heard it in the past few years because of Susan Boyle and her breakout into the spotlight. Surprisingly for Anne, she feels a bit calm and subdued into the song, and lets the song speak well from the simplicity of the voice well. This is a treat for anyone whom has never heard Anne Hathaway sing before, and for anyone that loves Les Miserables.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","classification":4,"fold":3}

I respected what they were doing, but none of their work blew me away. After about 2008 I sort of forgot about them. Recently, I started catching up on their post 2008 work and came across Year of the Black Rainbow. This is the first Coheed album I've heard that I can say actually stuck with me. I like the first few songs. These songs are faster and not as poppy as some of their other stuff. I felt as though I was listening to Glassjaw or Into Another, but better. Iv'e read reviews on here by people who say it was boring, but I think the people who write these reviews are all different ages and have different musical tastes.

Something about \"Locked Out Of Heaven\" leads one to believe that Mars's upcoming sophomore effort&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Unorthodox-Jukebox\/dp\/B009IRVSVQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Unorthodox Jukebox<\/a>&nbsp;will be even more distinct than his debut. Another Grammy for Mars pending? Perhaps.\n\nSomething that Mars does exceptionally (in concept) on \"Locked Out Of Heaven\" is that he differentiates it from his biggest hits including \"Just the Way You Are\" or \"Grenade.\" While the same characteristics are in play on \"Locked Out of Heaven,\" he does NOT rewrite himself, which is a pro.  Because \"Locked Out of Heaven\" has some Cee-Lo sensibility as far as its uniqueness, Mars's individuality and personality make this cut successful.  He does not tread into the dubstep and electronic influences that characterize much of pop today, which makes this 'old-school,' retro sound so appealing. The quick tempo keeps the momentum pulsating, as does Mars's soaring vocals.\n\nWith successive listens, \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Locked-Out-Of-Heaven\/dp\/B009KGKF3M\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Locked Out Of Heaven<\/a>\" captivates more and more.

{"text":"Jons not there, oh well, neither is Rick, oh well. Face it Yes as a creative entity has been over since they fired Patrick Moraz right after Relayer. Going For The One was good and Tormato wasn't, but neither was a step forward. I suppose 90125 was but was that band really Yes? No more or less than this one as far as I'm concerned. The revolving door of players has taken its toll on my patience and on my being able to give a damn. So I bought this cd and I found it enjoyable. Is it prog rock? Not if prog rock actually means progressive rock, meaning music that moves forward, is adventurous, has an aim and is engaged in elevating rock above the realm of pop commercialism and cliche. For contemporary musicians doing just that I'd recommend Deerhoof, TuneYards, Radiohead, Bat For Lashes, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, Tombs, Magma, King Crimson (retired?) or Scott Walker. Maybe even Animal Collective, Ween, Enslaved or Flaming Lips, but certainly not Yes. Yes gave up breaking new ground almost 30 years ago. This album is no exception. Is it great? No. Does it sound like previous Yes records? Yes, kinda. Anderson is missed, I like his voice a lot and Benoit David is a bit stiff by comparison. Do I miss Wakeman? Nope. He's most likely a great guy to have a pint with but his musical contributions with this band have been spotty since 1973, though I liked Going For The One, the studio parts of Keys To Ascension, and even Tormato. Fly From Here is pleasant music. Its not challenging, it breaks no new ground, but I like it. Its the musical equivalent of comfort food and cinematic in its sound and feel. I really don't expect much anymore from these musicians and they haven't disappointed me. So the reeking buns of Angel (Yes) don't smell like cocaine to me (anymore). Not that there's anything wrong with that. Thanks to Frank Zappa.","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.\n\nI'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea. Ever since 'Untouchables', there has been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of Korn albums, and for those of you who think I'm dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of Head, both 'Untouchables' and 'Take a Look in the Mirror' featured Head as the lead guitar. 'Untouchables' was a good album, not great. 'Mirror' was still decent, and I'll admit that there are a few redeeming tracks on both 'See You on the Other Side' and the 2008 edition of the self-titled album. However, a few redeeming tracks does not make up a whole album.\n\nI think its safe to say the the \"Korn sound\" was lost after 'Issues', and the band started putting together as many tracks as they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album. When you listen to their early work, the band wrote songs that were emotionally driven from \"Daddy\" on their debut album to \"Somebody Someone\" off of 'Issues.' With the release of 'Untouchables', the Korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in the 1950s. With each track, it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a 'catchy' chorus. This is not to say the albums released since 2000 have been bad, they just aren't worthy of a 5-star rating.\n\nThis new release sounds closer to \"Mirror\" than the last two, but it lacks the creativity that really separated Korn from the rest of the nu-metal one-hit-wonders polluting the radio waves. Does Jon Davis sound angrier on this album than the last two? Yes. Does he growl more? Sure. Are the lyrics memorable. No. Does the music stand out? Not really. I sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because I've been starved for new material, but lately I've been taking the time to really listen before I judge, and I ask myself if I'll feel the same about the record 6-months or a year down the road. In 6 months, listeners will have stopped reviewing this new release and they'll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the CD or turned it on via an MP3 player. They'll be listening to the older albums and telling everyone how the new album just isn't that great.\n\nI don't want to rip the band because they're still one of my favorites, but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of expression. Either that or spend more than a few weeks in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul. The album is not terrible, but it's unremarkable and candidly, it's also forgettable. My $.02","classification":2,"fold":3}

{"text":"Hearing the four man crew from Queensbridge, The Lost Boyz, once again brings back nostalgic memories of the golden age of hip hop music. Mr. Cheeks, Freaky Tah (R.I.P.), Spigg Nice, and Pretty Lou knew the formula to making good music, with most concepts working. With many dope recognizable singles such as \"Music Makes Me High\", \"Renee\", and \"Lex, Coups...\" (there is a remix floating out there I strongly recommend you hear). But what separates this crew from other groups is personalty. Mr. Cheeks is very charismatic on the microphone, and Freaky Tah plays the background vocals (those unfamiliar, think of him being what Flava Flav is to Chuck D in Public Enemy, only more serious).\n\nOne reason that makes this album great is their creative hooks, some of them will have you remembering for a while. \"Music Makes Me High\", and \"The Yearn\" are both entertaining (although I believe \"Da Game\" is very similar to the latter song). \"1,2,3\" is another great song too with the late Freaky Tah on the solo. \"Get Up\" is another song to easily remember, and slightly changes the atmosphere on the album. Other dope tracks to check out are the title song, and \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless\".\n\nThis album is great for the '95\/'96 era and can easily stack up to the many east coast hip hop albums that came out around that time. The album flows great, and I personally believe many fans will enjoy. The lyrics are definitely on point majority of the album.

{"text":"These Ten New Songs from 2001 are quite subdued and at first listen they all have the same slow gentle sound. But the old magic's still there on classics like In My Secret Life, Love Itself, The Land of Plenty and the elegant Alexandra Leaving. To be honest, this is not Cohen's most memorable album, nothing like the early classics or later masterpieces such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Future\/dp\/B0000028W9\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Future<\/a>.\n\nCohen covers familiar themes and one even recognizes lines from earlier songs, e.g. \"I do what I am told,\" on That Don't Make It Junk, while the elegiac mood of The Land Of Plenty reminds me of Heart With No Companion from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Various-Positions\/dp\/B0012GMW7A\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Various Positions<\/a>, an intense devotional with a sentiment of complete resignation and acceptance.\n\nBy The Rivers Dark which refers to Psalm 137 about singing a song to the Lord by the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Rivers-of-Babylon\/dp\/B00005QD6U\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rivers of Babylon<\/a>, contain oblique&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/autobiographical\/dp\/1930143893\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">autobiographical<\/a>&nbsp;elements. The most explicitly spiritual track The Land of Plenty is the highlight of the album and stirring in its melancholy honesty: \"For what's left of our religion\/I lift my voice and pray\/May the lights in the land of plenty\/Shine on the truth some day\".\n\nI enjoy Cohen's unusual excursions like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Death-of-a-Ladies-Man\/dp\/B0012GMVY4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Death of a Ladies' Man<\/a>&nbsp;and the esoteric&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Recent-Songs\/dp\/B0012GMX3S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Recent Songs<\/a>&nbsp;as much as his classic acoustic style so I have no problem with the synth-pop production. I love Sharon Robinson's vocals as backing and where she duets with him on tracks like Boogie Street and the exquisite Alexandra Leaving.\n\nFor more than five decades Cohen has been constructing a magnificent body of work that stands up to serious scrutiny and the passage of time.

She had done well with Tell Me when she was a part of Grove Theory, and had a few songs that hit the nail on the head when she has had them like Weary and Misery. Her latest single from her album Ice Cream Everyday, Afraid is a good song that really goes back to her original hit songs. I like it because it is a good rhythm and definitely a better song than what R&B has shown with sleaze from artists like Kanye West and lackluster rhythms from Rihanna. It is definitely a good song and beats what the younger generation wants in their music.

{"text":"The pointblank outpouring of the feminine soul - in a state of anguish & mourning - receives its full measure in this exceptional classic \"Un-break My Heart\"; sung with truly unique voice inflections & intonations by Toni Braxton; composed & written by Diane Eve Warren. We hear our heroine pleading for and commanding her deceased or departed lover to return to her immediately to assauge her loss and hurt, \"Don't leave me in all this pain, Don't leave me out in the rain...\" The use of the imperative is so forceful and direct, it heightens the impact of the song, and renders us as wrung out with catharsis - as she is.\n\nBraxton's soft, silky utterances easily immerse the listener in the strength and power of her heavier vocal chords - when she pours it on, \"Say you'll love me again, Undo this hurt you caused When you walked out the door And walked out of my life; Un-cry these tears, I cried so many nights...Un-break my heart!\" The excellent video for this song with its dramatic intensity lifts this rendition into being scene- and plot-driven, like \"Mourning Becomes Electra\" with the lights turned down.\n\nThis in turn builds plot and 'grief' motif within 'surround sound' orchestration. Braxton's intensity, her passionate request for her lover to return - becomes one of the more powerful crescendos in pop music. This would not be so - if her lips were sealed - they had to be un-sealed - her depth of expression from deep within her soul - may cause us to grieve (our catharsis, her purge of emotion). We listen to her final refrain and empathize with her loss. It is quite satisfying if not exhausting. We hope to be drenched in her emotional durge upon re-playing this cinematic song. It is yours to enjoy when the mood is right.\n\n\"Bring back the nights when I held you beside me\nUn-break my heart\nSay you'll love me again\nUndo this hurt you caused\nWhen you walked out the door\nAnd walked out of my life\nUn-cry this tears\nI cried so many, many nights\nUn-break my\nUn-break my heart oh baby\nCome back and say you love me\nUn-break my heart\nSweet darlin'\nWithout you I just can't go on\nCan't go on....\"","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Duck Rock from 1983 still sounds fresh and relevant. It's a brilliant fusion of world & roots music, scratch and sampling techniques, dance beats, pop hooks and rock riffs. The mainly instrumental Obatala opens the album on a moody mid-tempo note; based on a drumming style from the Dominican Republic, the languid track has snippets of a female vocal far in the background. Legba is similarly atmospheric but based on Cuban beats and purely instrumental whilst Buffalo Gals is an expertly arranged feast of samples, scratching, percolating rhythms and solo & massed vocals.\n\nFour songs are inspired by and employ musicians from South Africa, three from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Zulu\/dp\/B000000DXI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Zulu<\/a>&nbsp;culture and from the Shangaan (Tsonga). They are (1) the uptempo Double Dutch, one of the most melodious tracks with various forms of backing vocals (2) the fascinating hybrid Punk It Up, a song about&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Sex-Pistols\/dp\/B000002KIE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Sex Pistols<\/a>&nbsp;sung in English and Zulu with pennywhistles and gospel backing vocals, (3) the tuneful Jive My Baby Jive with its great interplay of male and female vocals and hypnotic beat. Shangaan township music is represented by (4) the buoyant Living on the Road in Soweto, an example of a popular style also present on Paul Simon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Graceland\/dp\/B0002EQ7E2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Graceland<\/a>.\n\nAnother one with a pronounced African influence is Song For Chango, a combination of chanting & Afro-Cuban rhythms. The fast-paced and polyrhythmic Merengue takes the listener back to the Dominican Republic, and is vaguely reminiscent of some of the styles that&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Kid-Creole-The-Coconuts\/dp\/B0000DG028\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kid Creole & The Coconuts<\/a>&nbsp;experimented with. Duck Rock concludes with Duck for the Oyster, a vibrant finale based on the Appalachian square dance with inspired fiddle playing. What makes it all the more charming and cohesive is the voice of a DJ and the callers that give it the lively feel of a radio show. Malcolm McLaren proves himself to be an excellent stylist on this innovative and well-produced album. Duck Rock is a joyful musical tour through Africa and the Caribbean.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Back in the early 2000's, Monster Magnet was pretty much a band that I overlooked. Out of all of their songs, \"Powertrip,\" \"Look To Your Orb for the Warning,\" and \"Heads Explode\" were the only ones that kept me engaged. Now, I delved deeper into their music, and immediately I was hooked. Monster Magnet has become one of my all-time favorite bands (alongside Deep Purple, Korn, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Mad at Gravity). So far, I've become a satisfied listener with 4-Way Diablo, Monolithic Baby, and Powertrip. Dopes to Infinity is close to perfection. The music is just right for my ears. \"Look To Your Orb For the Warning\" is my top favorite from this album (not because of The Matrix, trust me). \"Dopes to Infinity\" is a fantastic introduction to the album, and \"Negasonic Teenage Warhead\" deserves to be a single. From \"All Friends and Kingdom Come,\" straight to \"Vertigo,\" it's a completely satisfying experience.\n\nIt's too bad that Monster Magnet isn't very famous around the world. Looks like the music only applies to a specific taste. Despite that, I'm glad that I've explored the band's musical world.

{"text":"On her last record Animal and Cannibal EP, Ke$ha explored the dance-pop and electropop genres, while on this album she delves into a more electronic rock and pop rock sound thanks to the help of rock and roll legend Iggy Pop. Ke$ha's latest album Warrior is full of heavy drum beats, shredding guitars, combined with a dance-oriented pop sound. Here are some song reviews:\n\n1. \"Warrior\" (8\/10) - This is an amazing pop rock song and the perfect album opener.\n\n2. \"Die Young\" (9\/10) - The album's lead single. Its a great dance-pop\/electropop song that was the perfect choice to mark the return of Ke$ha after an indefinite hiatus.\n\n3. \"C'Mon\" (10\/10) - The album's second single. It has a really good beat, catchy lyrics and is Ke$ha at her best.\n\n4. \"Thinking of You\" - When I read the title, I thought it was going to be a ballad, but I was wrong. It's a hardcore pop rock song that doesn't disappoint.\n\n5. \"Crazy Kids\" (10\/10) - One of the album's many gems. This is a really great song and I love the whistling at the beginning of the song (so creative). It also shows off Ke$ha's rapping skills. This song should be released as a single ASAP.\n\n6. \"Wherever You Are\" (7\/10) - An okay song. It's basically a love song set to uptempo dance-pop\/electropop beats. It's not the best album cut, but it's also not the worst.\n\n7. \"Dirty Love\" (featuring Iggy Pop) [8\/10] - One of the album's many gems. It's a sexy pop rock song about hooking up with a guy and getting his \"dirty love\" (and I know you know what I mean).\n\n8. \"Wonderland\" (10\/10) - Another gem. After all of the upbeat songs, it's time to cool down with a midtempo soft rock song that's about looking back on your life and reminiscing. Another should-be single.\n\n9. \"Only Wanna Dance with You\" (7\/10) - A mediocre song. Its about saying that Ke$ha doesn't want to dance with anyone else but the object of her affection.\n\n10. \"Supernatural\" (8\/10) - Another gem and another should-be single.\n\n11. \"All That Matters (The Beautiful Life)\" (9\/10) - A great dance-pop\/electropop song. It's sort of like \"C'Mon\", but it's a lot more wild. Another should-be single.\n\n12. \"Love Into the Light\" (8\/10) - The album's second ballad. The song talks about coming out of the dark and into the light and letting all of that negativity wash away in the process.\n\nBonus Tracks:\n\n13. \"Last Goodbye\" (7\/10) - Like \"Wherever You Are\", it's a ballad set to uptempo beats and is about breaking up with your love interest. This track isn't necessarily one I would have on repeat, but I guess it's okay.\n\n14. \"Gold Trans Am\" (8\/10) - It's a hardcore pop rock song about having sex in a car.\n\n15. \"Out Alive\" (9\/10) - This is probably the most energetic song on the album.\n\n16. \"Past Lives\" (10\/10) - The best song on the album...hands down!!! It was the perfect closer. It's about you thinking that your relationship with your lover occurred in several of your past lives and thinking that no matter how many times you die and are reborn into a new body, your love will still exist.\n\nThis album also shows us that Ke$ha has grown and matured. I recommend this album to all Kesha fans (hardcore and casual), as well as anyone who loves to rock and roll. Ke$ha, if you reading this review, this was a smart career move and I can't wait to see what you have in store for us next. Keep up the good effort.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Dwight Yoakam is the reason I'm not embarrased to say I like country music.  When he broke onto the national scene with his debut album GUITARS, CADILLACS, ETC., ETC., he gave the country music establishment a much needed kick in the butt.  This twenty track collection hits most of the highlights of Yoakam's nearly two decades as a performer.  Starting with the Johnny Horton cover of \"Honky Tonk Man\" from his debut through two tracks from his 2003 release POPULATION: ME, Yoakam has had a major impact on country music.  If you're looking for a cheaper alternative to Rhino's 2002 box set REPRISE PLEASE BABY, this is a winner from beginning to end.  The only disappointment is that with a running time of just under 70 minutes, they could have added the only two top 10 singles missing from this set: \"Always Late With Your Kisses (from 1987's HILLBILLY DELUXE) and \"I Got You\" (from 1988's BUENAS NOCHES FROM A LONELY ROOM).  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  [2012 addendum:  The mp3 download version of this album has different cover art and eliminates the final two tracks from the 2003 album POPULATION ME, making this an all-Warner Bros. collection.]","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Prime Cuts: Happiness, Money and Fame, Testify\n\nAfter 2014's \"Rivers in the Wasteland,\" which was a more reflective and rootsy recess, NEEDTOREATHE are back in the saddle with open cylinders.  Sounding rejuvenated and upbeat, \"Hard Love\" (stylized as \"H A R D L O V E\") finds the quartet back with their familiar grunge rock sounds with undercurrents of soul and EDM.  The band is composed of Bear Rinehart (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Bo Rinehart (backing vocals, guitar), Seth Bolt (backing vocals, bass) and Josh Lovelace (backing vocals, keys). Prior to this release, they have released five studio albums: Daylight (2006), The Heat (2007), The Outsiders (2009), The Reckoning (2011) and Rivers in the Wasteland (2014).\n\nCo-produced by NEEDTOBREATHE and recorded at their very own Plantation Studios in Charleston, SC, \"H A R D L O V E\" is the quartet's sixth studio album.  In sync with the bulk of their own canon, these 12 songs pendulum swings between downright secular love and moralistic songs to thinly cloaked spiritual songs.  Opening with the 0.56 minute prelude \"Mountain Part One,\" we get a foretaste of the album with the song's electronic warbling and the distorted sounds.  With its distance-sounding vocals that calls to mind those analog records of the 70s and with swirling fat electronic beats, the title cut \"H A R D L O V E\" is where nu folk meets EDM.\n\nFeaturing some Motown brass horns accompanying a tune that could have well been written by Marvin Gaye in his prime is \"Money and Fame.\"  This soul-pricking tune warns against the temptations that the two commodities bring told with some arresting lines: \"I was sleeping with a loaded gun\/I was scared of all the things I've done.\"  \"No Excuses\" finds Bear utilizing his Prince-esque falsetto over an electric guitar-led rock tune.  Though the song doesn't mention Jesus directly, the punchy and upbeat \"Happiness\" gets to the heart of our Lord's teaching: what constitutes contentment?\n\n\"When I Sing\" and \"Great Night\" step away from the spiritual hefty terrain for more down time fun.  Yet, for a band who has got on ruminating about life's meaning via \"Happiness,\" to hear them singing:\"Let's have a great night on the dance floor\/I'll be the cowboy on the white horse\" sounds incongruous.  Much more substantial is the romantic folkish ballad \"Let's Stay Home Tonight.\"  \"Testify,\" which is a modern worship anthem about surrendering to God, gets back into the CCM territory.\n\nThe same can be said about \"Clear\" which is essentially a love song to God.  Though it is understandable that NEEDTOBREATHE is trying to reach beyond the CCM crowd, but when it's a blatant worship song, is it too much to ask if the name \"Jesus\" is mentioned perhaps once or twice?","classification":4,"fold":3}

Although I still like the movie vocal arrangement of \"Black Boys\" and \"White Boys\" with the duet between the male and female voices--and nobody can touch Cheryl Barnes's version of \"Easy To Be Hard\"--this new cast and revival of the musical is truly enjoyable.\n\nHAIR comes with a small booklet with liner notes by Oskar Eustis, Artistic Director-The Public Theater and Diane Paulus, Hair's Director. Also included are color pictures of the cast and production history notes. I wish they included the lyrics, but no such luck.\n\nThe cover art is also a little boring compared to the previous releases and belies the fun and high energy that the soundtrack music conveys to the audience.\n\nLet the sun shine in and get HAIR (THE NEW BROADWAY CAST RECORDING) today!

{"text":"This is a rather difficult review to write, first because Im rather fond of Gaslight Anthem, and secondly because I dearly want to be inspired to like this solo project from Brian Fallon.\n\nIf theres one characteristic that Fallon carries around with him and refuses to let go of, its his penchant for spending too much time looking in his rearview mirror, over his shoulder, and his downright desire to be anyone other than who he actually is.  As to the rearview mirror aspect, if one listens to the mans lyrics on both the Gaslight Anthem albums and this solo outing, Brian seems to fear that his past is creeping up on him, and in so doing, that past is eventually going to catch up with him, and at that moment in time, hes going to have to come face to face with the present, the here and now, and his place in it.  When that time comes, Im sincerely hoping that his visions are focused on the future, because essentially there is nothing one can write about that happened a mere two hours in the past, over breakfast, so hes gonna have to face a future, and write about some things hed like to see happen, about dreams he longs to have come true, rather than resurrecting a past for which no one can do anything about.\n\nAs to him wishing to be someone else, on The 59 Sound, a song by Gaslight Anthem, he waxes longingly that he wishes he looked like Elvis, and then goes on to allude to Sam Space in Casablanca on the album jacket, while Gaslight has yet another song entitled Steve McQueen.  Of course wed all like to be someone other than ourselves at times  but theres a genuine difference between that, and not coming to grips with the fact that we are who we are.  Of course one could easily point to Springsteen when it comes to either of these aspects, yet Bruce wasn't so much living in the past, its more that he was revealing himself to us, telling us his stories, what made him who he is as he moved into the present.  And yes, one could certainly infer that Springsteens most interesting and beloved albums came from viewing his past.  And while thats all well and good, Bruce accepted those nostalgic characters, those struggling years, owing them, making them his own, while Fallon seems to be trying to out run them, as if by giving them voice, they will turn to dust, no longer being present to torment his mind.\n\nTheres no mistaking that Pain Killers obsessively belongs to Brian Fallon  its chocked full of idyllic images of an America that no longer exists, and probably never existed as Fallon has come to romanticize it; with that romanticization shading both the good and negative aspects of his plagued memories.  Frankly, Fallons become sort of a parody of himself, after all, how many girls named Maria, and how many times can he image a late night diner before actual cracks appear, and folks begin to think that they're hearing their the same old songs through a new set of speakers.\n\nI so wish that Brian Fallon would grasp the idea that even the losers get lucky some times [to paraphrase Tom Petty], because I actually like hearing the man sing, investing myself in his visions, and listening to his narratives.  Each song from Pain Killers feels as if the man is standing outside of not so much himself, but of real life, giving me the sensation that even as Fallon is holding faded photographic images, those images are bleaching in the sun, leaving him with only impressions of not only those images, but of his memory, where nothing can be trusted as truth.\n\nWith all that being said, Pain Killers is the sort of thing that draws me in, like a cheap pulp novel you read and leave on the seat of the crosstown bus when you're finished.  Nothing here is a keeper, but what Fallon does do is linger in my mind, where his memories mesh with mine, where I feel not so much alone knowing that Brian Fallon is out there reminding me that perhaps in this day and age, the past is not such a bad place to stake a claim.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band, the Rolling Stones are releasing six (count 'em, six!) chronological greatest hits albums: a budget two-CD, a standard three-CD, a deluxe three-CD, a deluxe five-LP, a deluxe Blu-Ray, and a super deluxe five-CD\/one-EP collection. The best-of compilations are expertly remastered, albeit selectively edited for length, so while newer listeners probably won't notice anything amiss, nostalgic fans might.\n\nThe two-disc bargain-bin set is adequate only for casual fans who just want some of their biggest hits and won't miss classic songs like \"Time Is on My Side.\" The first CD takes you from the band's earliest single, a 1963 cover of Chuck Berry's \"Come On,\" to \"Wild Horses\" on the 1971 album \"Sticky Fingers.\" The second CD starts with \"Brown Sugar,\" also from \"Sticky Fingers,\" and ends with their final studio album in 2005, \"A Bigger Bang,\" plus two new studio recordings, \"Doom and Gloom\" and \"One More Shot,\" both of which harken back to the rough classic sound of the Stones.\n\nThe first two discs of the standard three-CD version of \"GRRR!\" (33 out of 50 tracks) cover the Stones' early career, revisiting most of the required studio LPs and singles from the 60s up to the album \"Black and Blue\" in 1976. The third disc contains 17 recordings from the 1978 album \"Some Girls\" (though not the title track) to \"A Bigger Bang,\" plus the new songs. A 12-page booklet is enclosed. It's a big improvement on \"Forty Licks,\" the two-disc, 40-track, 40th-anniversary collection released in 2002. Of the four new tunes that appeared on that non-chronological album, only \"Don't Stop\" is recycled; 33 of the 36 remaining cuts are included on the three-CD edition (absent are \"Mother's Little Helper,\" \"Shattered,\" and \"You Got Me Rocking\"). These 33 are supplemented with a couple of mid-60s covers, Buddy Holly's \"Not Fade Away\" and Howlin' Wolf's \"Little Red Rooster,\" and enough important songs from the Glimmer Twins to make a more satisfying package: \"Time Is on My Side,\" \"Heart of Stone,\" \"As Tears Go By,\" \"Rocks Off,\" \"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker),\" \"Respectable,\" \"Waiting on a Friend,\" \"Harlem Shuffle,\" \"Streets of Love,\" and more.\n\nCompilations will never take the place of individual albums from the Rolling Stones' peak years, and they'll never please longtime fans like me who have no need for obvious radio fodder and want the rare stuff and the live stuff instead. There aren't a lot of surprises in the standard box, and the editing and inevitable omissions also reduce its value. Where are \"Live with Me\" and \"Let It Bleed\" and \"Dead Flowers\" and \"Hang Fire\" and a dozen more? The skimpy two-CD set earns just three stars as it drops 10 songs from the three-CD set: \"Time Is on My Side,\" \"Heart of Stone,\" \"Under My Thumb,\" \"We Love You,\" \"She's a Rainbow,\" \"Highwire,\" \"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker),\" \"She Was Hot,\" \"Streets of Love,\" and \"Rocks Off.\" If you're in the market for greatest hits, something to remind you of the Stones' awesome talent and staying power over the years, I'd spend a few extra bucks for the standard edition.","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"What happens when you mix blues and rock? This album happens.\n\nI haven't listened to Bonnie Raitt in probably 20 years. I wasn't inclined to try this new album when Amazon kept telling me to try it every single day . But Amazon wore me down and I tried it....\n\nAnd then I listened to it twice in a row!\n\nI'm pretty sure Bonnie Raitt's voice has gotten better over the years. The slightly raspy tone is a perfect match for the set list on this album. Her band is great. Make sure you are listening on speakers or a headset that handles bass well because the band has a strong bass drum beat that gives the music energy.\n\nHer cover of INXS's 'Need You Tonight' is fantastic. Just fantastic. I didn't recognize what it was it at first, but then started saying \"This sounds familiar....\" and then suddenly \"Oh wow!!\" It's a bluesy take on a 80's pop song. And she owns it!!!\n\nShe brings things down a notch for a softer melody in 'Undone'. It's a very peaceful, soothing sound with deep lyrics. This was one of my favorites off the album.\n\n\"The Ones We Couldn't Be\" is a very sad song but so beautifully done that you can't help but want to hear it again.\n\nMost of the album is up tempo and jammin' though. It's a great listen.\n\nI've never seen Bonnie Raitt in concert, but I've got a strong feeling that it's a pretty kickin' show. You just get that feeling listening to this album.\n\n(Note: I didn't not listen to Shakin' Shakin' Shakes as part of this review because no matter what I do I can't get it to play in the Amazon Prime music app)","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I recently saw \"Chappie\" in the theater (more on that later). One of the more impressive aspects of the movie was the music, and by that I mean both the instrumental score and also the song placements. When I started looking around for the soundtrack, it lead me to this.\n\n\"Chappie - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\" (16 tracks; 63 min.) brings the instrumental, all-electronic score composed by veteran Hollywood composer Hans Zimmer (too many past accolades to list here). Or, as Zimmer himself has referred to it: \"The Chappie Elektrik Synthphonia\". The mood for the soundtrack is set by the opening track, the menacing \"It's a Dangerous City\". It immediately reminds me of similar-sounding recent scores from ex-Chili Pepper Cliff Martinez (think \"Drive\", \"Only God Forgives\", etc.), and I mean this as a compliment. Another comparison that works perhaps even better is another sci-fi all-electronica soundtrack from the 80s, \"Blade Runner\" by Vangelis. \"A Machine That Thinks And Feels\" is as intimate as the title suggests, barely audible at that. \"Welcome To the Real World\" is another hard-charging, pulsating track. \"Rudest Bad boy in Joburg\" sounds like it could be the extended intro for a Kraftwerk tune. The piece de resistance on here, though, is the 8 min. epic \"Never Break a Promise\", just wow. Bottom line: this is a fantastic electronic score, right up my alley. I'm absolutely loving this. BUYER BEWARE: the songs that are featured in the film are NOT included. Hence, if you were expecting all those Die Antwoord songs (Happy Go Sucky F*cky; Never Le Nkemise 1; Fatty Boom Boom; Enter the Ninja; Cookie Thumper; Evil Boy; Baby's On Fire) on here, you will be in for a huge disappointment, so please make sure that what you are getting with this soundtrack is in line with your expectations.\n\nAs to the film itself: South African director Neil Blomkamp has a number of good ideas but in the end can't decide whether \"Chappie\" is supposed to be a psychological drama (like, say, \"Robot and Frank\") or an action movie (like, say, \"Robocop\") and in the end it is neither. Still I'm glad I checked it out. Meanwhile the \"Chappie\" soundtrack is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Here are the Beatles' best recordings from 1967 to 1970. I described the design of the Apple label in my review for the 1962-66 set. This set is blue(the label background,the cover border and the CD panel). Now the songs: SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND tracks are the title track,WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS,LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS and A DAY IN THE LIFE. The Beatles' manager Brian Epstein fatally overdosed on drugs in '67. From MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR are the title track,THE FOOL ON THE HILL,I AM THE WALRUS,HELLO GOODBYE,STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER,ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE and PENNY LANE. LADY MADONNA is cool. HEY JUDE was written by John Lennon for his son Julian and sung by Paul McCartney. On this set is an alternate version of John's REVOLUTION. This is not the same version on the \"White Album\"(that version is entitled REVOLUTION 1). George Harrison's personally penned WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS,HERE COMES THE SUN,SOMETHING and OLD BROWN SHOE are on this set. Ringo Starr's OCTOPUS'S GARDEN from ABBEY ROAD appears on this set also. From 1968's \"White Album\"(the group's self-titled album) are BACK IN THE U.S.S.R. and OB-LA-DI-OB-LA-DA. Paul really kicks with his song GET BACK. DON'T LET ME DOWN was an outtake. THE BALLAD OF JOHN AND YOKO is the fairy tale of the 1969 wedding of John and Yoko Ono and the honeymoon that followed. On March 12 that year,Paul and Linda Eastman married and John and Yoko's wedding commenced eight days later. John's kicking COME TOGETHER really rocks. It was later covered by Aerosmith and Michael Jackson. LET IT BE,an alternate version(not the version on the album of the same name),has a religious theme. Two other LET IT BE tracks are ACROSS THE UNIVERSE and THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD. Personal and managerial differences caused the Beatles to disband in 1970. Also,then all four Beatles were married. Each Beatle moved on to individual solo careers.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Among the many great political MC's like the legendary Chuck D or Immortal Techniue, Lupe Fiasco has taken upon himself to be the number one mainstream political rapper in the game. \"Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor\" is and still a classic to me, so a sequel to that album has risen a lot of high exectations for me as a Lupe fan. After the mediocre LASERS album he released last year, Lupe had to cover a lot of ground in order to regain back his essence. To me Lupe came correct with Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album Pt. 1, but I will not say it is a direct sequel to his debut album. To me, Food & Liquor II is like a mix between the 1st Food & Liquor and The COOL. The vibe on this album is dark similar to The Cool which isn't a problem for me, however Lupe rarely lightens up on this particular album in lyrics nor sound, with the exception of 2 songs. This album is like one long lecture of Lupe trying to enlighten his listeners, and sometimes it can be a difficult to hear. While I have always enjoyed Lupes political songs, being political on an entire album is a different story. Sometimes it can be an endeavor to listen to the album while trying to decipher his messages, and some songs concepts can be a little misconstrued. For example \"Lamborghini Angels\" tackles religion, but it's hard to truly grasp the message Lupe is trying to ensue. A lot of his songs on this album are a mixed bag of conscious rap with sooo many topics packed in, that a song's main message can completely fly over peoples heads. That is pretty much the only problem I have with the album, besides that this album is definitely in my top 5 Hip Hop albums of 2012 thus far.\n\nThe production in the first half of the album (while sounds good) can be monotonous at times with the exception of \"Around My Way\" a remake of Pete Rock's classic T.R.O.Y., in which Lupe did wonderful on. Once you get to track 9 \"Heart Donor\" the sound comepletely shifts into a much more diverse and enjoyable listen with a more upbeat sound that is reminicent of his first album. Keep in my mind, Lupe's lyrics in the first half of the album are still outstanding and filled with great depth particularily \"Audobon Ballroom\" which tackles racism with a hilarious hook by Lupe in my opinion. The songs he previously released himself are all present and still hold up great. \"B**** Bad\", probably one of the most important Hip Hop songs released this year contains the most sarcastic and true to form Lupe. If fans remember, Lupe did a song on his first album \"Hurt Me Soul\" that ties in with his views on B* Bad, which is nice to know that Lupe has been consistant 7 years later. \"Battle Scars\" is a duet with Australian singer Guy Sebastian, I heard a couple monthes back and it still hasn't grown on me, don't get me wrong I like the message and lyrics, but the song just sounds corny and unoriginal. It disgustingly reminds me of songs like \"Mirrors\" by Lil Wayne and Bruno Mars, or \"Airplanes\" by B.o. B and Hayley Williams. The opening track \"Strange Fruition\" has Lupe collaborating with his longtime producer, Soundtrakk, which is nice to hear since he was absent on LASERS, and its good to hear that they haven't lost a step. This song has an unorthadox hook but it works, Lupe's Lyrics on this song are also one of my personal favorites on the entire album. Songs like \"ITAL (Roses)\" and \"Brave Heart\" feature some of the hardest beats on the album, with hard bass and snyths that will just bump in your car. \"Heart Donor\" and \"How Dare You\" feat. Bilal are the lightest songs on the album, and sounds a little random on the album, but the lyrics and funky beats balances the album out a little bit. The \"Hood Now\" outro is a great way to end the album, the moody production and Lupe re-representing the Hood is a great way for him to connect to his people. The best song on the album for me have to \"Forms Follow Function\" which is Lupe at his absolute best. The production is great with the saxophone creeping in the background and Lupe Fiasco in his purest MC form that correlates to life to the architectural principle form follows function in which the concept of the song derives from. I love the album and everything Lupe has done (Yes even LASERS) and after listening to this album, my anticipation for  PART 2 is even greater. I can't wait!!!!\n\nPersonal Favorite Tracks\n1) Form Follows Function\n2) Unforgivable Youth\n3) Strange Fruition\n4) Brave Heart\n5) Around My Way (Freedom Ain't Free)\n6) ITAL (Roses)\n7) B**** Bad\n8) Audubon Ballroom","classification":5,"fold":3}

They look clean-cut, sing out the anthems clearly, see time when they look over their shoulder and almost seem engaged. The Vaccines appear to reach for the lowest hanging fruit in a bid for stardom, but I can say that the disc got in my hands as an impulse buy as I was leaving the Sound Garden (Balt.) and it hasn't left the car deck since. The lone review I had read prior said they had smashed up against the rocks of the shores in the good ole US of A, and we have a way with crushing dreams of British bands, but if the well-worn paths of the stars mentioned above have an attraction for you, this permutation of those sterling examples might go down easy.

{"text":"We Five released an excellent folk rock debut album with their \"You Were On My Mind.\" This was released and still available here on record album; it's also available as part of a two-fer CD You Were On My Mind \/ Make Someone Happy. Specifically, We Five consisted of Michael Stewart; Peter Fullerton; Beverly Bivens; Bob Jones and Jerry Burgan. Together these talented artists really made heads turn whenever their music was played or they performed in concert; and that's special. In addition, if you still have a turntable like I do, you can consider this on vinyl record album instead of CD--the sound is actually quite good!\n\n\"Love Me Not Tomorrow\" begins with Beverly Bivens singing wonderfully and the musical arrangement makes good use of the guitars and percussion--and those key changes between major and minor enhance the ballad, too! We Five performs \"Somewhere Beyond the Sea,\" a classic number, with panache and the faster tempo than I'm used to hearing for this tune actually work wonders for the song. \"My Favorite Things\" from \"The Sound of Music\" starts with a brief guitar musical intro and when they start singing this number really takes flight! They perform \"My Favorite Things\" very passionately. \"If I Were Alone\" is most memorable and We Five turns out a fine interpretation of \"Tonight\" from \"West Side Story.\" \"Cast Your Fate to the Winds\" is easy on the ear, too; I really like the way they perform this!\n\nOn side two of the album comes the title track, \"You Were On My Mind\" by Sylvia Tyson; this is a huge highlight of the record and they couldn't have done this any better! I love the way this sounds; what a great tune this is! We Five does a beautiful rendition of \"Can't Help Falling in Love;\" it's very, very sweet and \"Small World\" is brief but totally charming. Their rock and roll version of \"I Got Plenty O' Nuttin'\" really sounds great; as always this showcases their talent nicely. \"Softly As I Leave You\" charms me with its beauty and as always they never let go of a superfluous note and I'm very impressed. \"I Can Never Go Home Again\" ends the album with another poignant folk tune that I won't forget anytime soon.\n\nWe Five didn't stay together forever but what they shared with us is nothing short of wonderful. I highly recommend their music especially for people who appreciate 1960s folk rock and the work of the individual artists after the group disbanded.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play \"Amarillo By Morning,\" and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to \"Amarillo by Morning.\"\n\nSo, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy\/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Ride the Lightning is the one Metallica album that seriously has a lot of aggressive power and remains a classic to this day.  While I'm not particularly thrilled with a few moments here and there, overall it's much better than what many of the metal bands in the mid 80's were doing (with all their big hair, constant partying and chicks).  Metallica's music remains fresh and exciting all these years later.  This album was REALLY underrated back in the mid 80's.  People back then didn't know how to approach something with this much speed and punch.\n\nFight Fire With Fire- a plodding guitar riff, and the idea for an acoustic intro is ripped off from a couple old Black Sabbath tunes.  The verse melody is horrible but the chorus is decent.\n\nRide the Lightning- the best part of the song is the 15-second guitar intro.  I love that.  Great chorus as well that remains memorable no matter how many times it's played.  Great guitar solo as well.  Some parts of the solo remind me of the mid 70's Rainbow song called \"Light in the Black\".\n\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls- let's just call it the way it is- this is a classic metal track in the same way \"Iron Man\" is Black Sabbath's classic.\n\nFade to Black- a softer number that gradually builds into a much heavier and typical Metallica track.  It's not really a ballad.  It's a shame the verse melody has been copied time and time again by Metallica themselves as early as their Black Album in the early 90's.  The original idea was right here on this album.  The lyrics don't sound very emotionally honest though.  I like the second half of the song more even though parts of the guitar solo sound ripped off from Black Sabbath's \"Snowblind\".\n\nTrapped Under Ice- flashy guitar playing that sounds like a leftover from the Kill 'em All album.  Not that that's a bad thing, mind you.\n\nEscape- really good song, though the chorus sounds stuck in the 80's with that dated sound.  I like the way the verse melody chugs along.  Great lyrics by their standards too.\n\nCreeping Death- another memorable heavy\/speed metal track.  These guys were clearly more talented than most.  The guitar solo sure sounds like it was copied from a popular Scorpions song at the time.\n\nCall of Ktulu- a very slow, rocking build up.  It's really good but 9 minutes might tire out some people.\n\nYou need to have at least one Metallica album in your collection, and none of them are better than this one.  Get it.","classification":5,"fold":3}

Zak stevens (Sang only in Beethoven's last night) left Savatage to be with the family and surprisingly came back and made CIIC band and being rude enough to come ask Jon Oliva for his help! Come on!\n\nOverall, I say since Savatage members are happy we should be happy that at least they got the attention they deserve even under TSO name.","classification":1,"fold":3}

While there is no Smoke on the Water here, this whole CD is Deep Purple goodness, including majestic organ riffs (even though Jon Lord is no longer with  us), memorable hooks, guitar riffs, and serviceable vocals.\n\nTwo of the 11 songs are over 6:00 in length, four are over 5:00, the rest over 4:00; there are no attempts at hit singles, which is great since no one wants to hear a \"single wannabe\" from Deep Purple. They do what they've always done, rock out. I've always felt Deep Purple was underrated, they never seem to get the same level of respect as Black Sabbath for example, and they're every bit as good and influential.\n\nWhile I admit that I bought this on a whim, ready to laugh it right off my iPod, the joke's on me.

Music has become so bland, and CD singles so scarce these days, it is almost impossible to find interesting releases that are worth spending $6 for. Well, here is one, though I would rather have all 10+ mixes of \"Revolution\" in one disc, instead of having to wait until April 28 for the 2LP 12\" vinyl for the next instalment. Cannot but feel a little cheated, but noone is forcing me to purchase anything I do not want. This brand new CD single is a nice little DM addition to my collection, and I am happy to have purchased it. Truth be told, the song is nothing to get crazy about, though it is interesting to hear their ambiguous spiritual\/political message, trying to get both sides talking. I find even more enjoyable the video with the brilliant Lenin references. Nonetheless, this is a tasty appetiser for the upcoming \"Spirit\" album.\n\nCD single tracklist:\n\n1.

It is just too sad that they haven't shown enough chemistry in regards to a song being more everlasting at the soul, and just sounds more like a fad eventually going away. That has honestly happened so often with a lot of girl groups from the Pussycat Dolls and others losing their career focus, and will only have maybe at least one song to stand the test of time alone. Unfortunately for Fifth Harmony, they have been really lagging in regards to better songs, and not showing individual harmonies and chemistry at the soul. They did barely show it with Write On Me from their 7\/27 album. Work From Home though isn't actually a driven song that ignites from the heart, and the song just drags down overall. I didn't like the song at the very end, and the gals definitely haven't really been able to learn from their first set of songs like Worth It & Sledgehammer.

It's a project after 2010's successful effort,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Raymond-v-Raymond\/dp\/B002RAREAK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Raymond v.

I honestly can't compare the two seeing as I haven't heard the complete CD of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Raymond-v-Raymond\/dp\/B002RAREAK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Raymond v. Raymond<\/a>&nbsp;but I'm gonna show you what I thought about this project song by song. Sorry if it comes off as long, I'd just like to think it's in-depth. :)\n\n1. Love 'Em All -- A real cool track that starts Usher on the right foot. He is basically just saying there are too many women available, so he's gonna love them all. B-\n\n2. DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love (Feat. Pitbull) -- Not a bad dance R&B cut. At first I wasn't sure how I felt about this song, but it really isn't bad. I'm sure after you hear it too many times, it will get annoying but it's really not bad. Pitbull's part is OK. Something you can definitely dance to. C+\n\n3. Hot Tottie (Feat. Jay-Z) -- The beat isn't bad on this track. However, you would think the track would be better considering it's with 2 of the game's hottest superstars right now. Jay-Z's verse is pretty good though. B-\n\n4. Lay You Down -- Finally. A slower jam. I usually like Usher's downtempos because they end up being a bit sensual. 'Can U Handle It' is still his best slow song, in my opinion (out of all of his catalog. Yes, I said it!). This one isn't bad. It's just not as good as that song. Not even as good as 'Seduction'. I like the piano though. C\n\n5. Lingerie -- This song is a freaky one. However, it's also kind of filler. Not much to say. The beat ain't that great and that's what Usher is about these days so... C-\n\n6. There Goes My Baby -- I'm getting tired of this song. However, as a whole, it's not bad, especially considering it's a radio song. It's just played out by now. If you didn't realize, it was also on his album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Raymond-v-Raymond\/dp\/B002RAREAK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Raymond v. Raymond<\/a>&nbsp;and served as the 4th (and final?) single. C+\n\n7. Get In My Car (Feat. Bun B) -- The beat is kinda lazy on this effort, but this song ends up not being bad. There's something about it. It feels like a marching band of some sorts. Usher's lyrics on this are similar to what the subject on 'Love 'Em All' is. Just not as good a song. C\n\n8. Somebody To Love (Remix) (Feat. Justin Bieber) -- This song is a bit out of place, lyrically. The beat fits in with the likes of 'DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love' but the words to the song are about being faithful and wanting someone to love instead of flirting and getting your freak on with. Justin only has one verse and sort of gets put in the background towards the end so his part feels tacked on when it's originally his song. So that was kinda crappy. But all in all, this is one of the better songs on the album along with 'Love 'Em All' and 'Hot Tottie'. B-\n\n9. Strangers Come -- He saved the last track to be totally serious. And it's a good song. It's about trying to get a girl that has been hurt and doesn't take any of his advances. Usher doesn't give up either. C+\n\nThis EP was totally worth checking out even though I think Usher hasn't been putting his all in his projects since 2004's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Confessions\/dp\/B0002ZYDKQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Confessions<\/a>.

{"text":"This CD is more than Rodrigo's Concerto. Most reviewers ignored the Albeniz, but before I get to those tracks, I will say that the Concerto de Aranjuez is a live recording and that spark does manifest. Narciso Yepes, Julian Bream, and John Williams are better classical guitarists than Paco de Lucia, but in this recording the partner orchestra has a superior performance than others. Morever, de Lucia's third movement is more sensitive than his guitar colleagues. On the negative side, this is an old recording and the sound engineering is very good but not up to the standards of today. The guitar, a quiet instrument, merges with the orchestra. The concerto for guitar seems more concerto for symphony orchestra and guitar. Together, however, this version, indeed interpetation, as the label notes, is very fine but not outstanding. As for the 3-guitar version of three excerpts from Iberia by Isaac Albeniz, I find them entirely wrong in musical concept. Listen to Alicia de Larroucha perform the suite as it should be, on piano. The guitars are tinny and the musical punch is lost. The piano is orchestral in its range and we truly hear the melodies and feel the emotions of each section. Thus, given a choice, I would choose another album with Rodrigo's concerto.","classification":3,"fold":3}

The songs here have a tendency to make you want to play some air guitar (that's not what I do, personally). Either that, or make you want to buy the album straight away. Songs like \"Radiation Day,\" \"Hotel Baby,\" \"The Right Stuff,\" and \"Too Bad\" are surefire winners of ultimate stoner rock. \"Monolithic\" is just craves for your attention (and that's a good thing), while \"Master of Light,\" my personal favorite on the album, can be best described as nothing short of amazing. \"There's No Way Out of Here\" and \"Ultimate Everything\" should go down in history as two of the most underrated rock songs of the 2000's.\n\nI'm just getting into Monster Magnet's other albums, and I don't think I'll stop because their music is never boring or dull.

{"text":"Taylor is a great young blues guitarist \/ singer \/ songwriter that came out of the UK with her debut album in 2009.  \"Diamonds\" is her follow-up to that effort and although it is a good album, she suffers from a bit of a sophomore slump with this one.  The songwriting is ok, but not quite as strong as her first one in my opinion with lyrics that tackle typical blues themes, but nothing really original.  The decision to fade out several of the tracks, just as the guitar is really kicking in, is puzzling to me as well.  Obviously it was a conscious decision, but where on the first album the guitar solos were a highlight on this one many of the solos never seem to get the chance to really take flight.  One could argue that this album is more focused than the first one, and depending on your perspective this may be a valid point, but to my ears things are reined in a bit too much here.  I realize I am being pretty negative, and I really do not want to imply that this is a bad album, but compared to the promise of her debut this one is a slight step backwards to my ears.  It probably comes down more to personal taste as I imagine there are people who will like this one better than her first one, depending on what the listeners personal taste in his or her blues records.  Taylor is still a great young talent that deserves as much exposure as she can get, but I still feel slightly let down by this release.","classification":3,"fold":3}

{"text":"This one's a no brainer: Pet Shop Boys release new album; I buy new album, for every album of theirs has at least a couple of stunners. And the best thing about them? Even if I don't love the melody or music to one of their tracks I enjoy listening anyway for those clever lyrics and sharp observations on human behavior. The one that's jumped out of the pack this time so far is \"Everything Means Something.\" Their brilliance is such that each album is layered: I listen once, and a gorgeous chord change catches my ears; listen twice, and it's a great lyrical twist. As for not doing yet another album of dance tracks, perhaps the boys have tired a bit of the clubs? Given the dreadful state of current dance music, which mostly sounds like a bunch of wanna-be-decadent tarts and assorted cheerleaders urging people to \"party, clap your hands, bla-bla-bla\" I wouldn't be surprised. However, what I've found is a humor as sharp as cat claws on this album, and at least two of the cuts made me laugh out loud. Do the boys have a sense of humor? Hell yes! They've cut enough rugs in their time; now they're cutting at some of the crap in relationships again, and few do it better. Love \"Your Early Stuff\" guys, but I'm a long time fan, and still with you on this one. Whatever else, you are never \"being boring\".","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"It might be a great phrase to start a fight in a bar, turn heads, and\/or make you lose your man card, but this is Mayer's most cheesiest song and a catchy pop track that put him on the map, which is rather strange considering his current blues rock path he's been travelling. But, there is an ever so brief flash of greatness in a short electric solo toward the bridge that is just a glimpse of what's to come.\n\nBut, judging by the lyrics, if I was a girl, I wouldn't know whether to think if I would want my man to sing this, or if it's just a bit too creepy. And of course, the music video is classic teen heartthrob Mayer, making all the ladies swoon, with his good looks, and his rather loud hinting. It's definitely a bad song to karaoke too, a good teenage lovemaking melody-type thing going on, and the darn cheesiest thing he's ever made. Take it as is, because there's no other way to take it.

{"text":"According to Dave Gilmour `The Endless River' is based around more than 20 hours of archived recordings from `The Division Bell' sessions in 1993 not included in the final album cut, with the late Richard Wright's keyboard work and compositional skills dominating the action. TER is reportedly a tribute to Wright's memory from Gilmour and Mason, who set about cleaning up the original recordings and added in new sections to spice them up.\n\nThe result is an ambient and almost completely instrumental collection: only the closer `Louder than Words' is an actual song, penned by Gilmour's wife Polly, and Stephen Hawking's voice guest-samples briefly on `Talkin Hawkin'.\n\nThis is unmistakably classic Floyd, with grand instrumental pieces redolent in many places of the towering magnificence of their music in the 1970s bookended by `Atom Heart Mother' and `Wish You were Here,' prior to Roger Waters taking control of the band's persona with the lyrically verbose & preachy epic `The Wall.' Gilmour's wailing guitar weaves around Wright's melodious synth phrases underpinned by Mason's stately, energetic drumming with never a note out of place. At the same time ambient and majestic, many of these pieces bring to mind not only `The Division Bell' but the musical ghosts of `Echoes' or `Shine on You Crazy Diamond'.\n\nTER is probably going to be Pink Floyd's last album release, and it's a fitting one. Whilst not breaking new ground, this is Floyd (minus Waters) on top form, doing what they have always done best. Production values are first class, and this music will no doubt be played and enjoyed in millions of homes, cars and iPods for decades to come.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"This time last year there was a lot of chatter about a Lloyd Banks comeback album.  I admit after the disaster that was Rotten Apple I wasn't too optimistic for him.  He had a series of underground mixtapes that only his die hard loyal fans enjoyed because it was filled with the punchline rap that dominated the early part of the decade and less than stellar production.  Nonetheless, Lloyd Banks decided to reinvent himself and come out hard.  After label switches and feuding with Rick Ross he released Beamer Benz or Bentley, a highly successful single that really put Lloyd Banks back in the minds of the mainstream.\n\nLloyd Banks began making his runs with guest appearances, interviews and singles that increased anticipation for the album.  His Blue Friday series was very successful in which he released a new song (none included on the album) every Friday (or so). Given the quality of the songs, I began anticipating the album.  The Hunger For More 2 has finally come out on a crowded day that also featured Kanye West, Nicki Minaj & Ne-Yo.  Needless to say his release was overlooked not because it's wack but because that's just how it is.\n\nThe Hunger For More 2 delivers on the production side of things as well as Lloyd Banks lyrics.  He has almost completely let go of the punchline filled rap to a more mature reality type rap and I must say it suits him a lot better.  With a naturally muffled voice, he never really could deliver his punchlines with authority.  But with his laid back style a more reflective and real style helps him shine through.  The beats are a lot harder this time around as well and will get the Rotten Apple taste out of your mouth.  Guests include Kanye West, Fabolous, Ryan Leslie, Styles P, 50 Cent, Tony Yayo, Lloyd, Jeremih, Raekwon, Akon, Pusha T, & Juelz Santana.  That's plenty of features for a 13 track album but the guests never feel tacked on and work within the concept of the song. The songs I'm feeling the most are I Don't Deserve You ft. the underated Jeremih, Any Girl with Lloyd, Start It Up, and Home Sweet Home.  Less than stellar songs include On The Double and Celebrity.\n\nFans of Lloyd Banks should definitely check this one out as well as fans of hardcore hip hop albums.  Hunger For More 2 is a very worthy release and a welcome return for Lloyd Banks. 4 Stars. Recommended.\n\n*The 5 Bonus tracks are Feel Like You ft. Eminem, Where I'm At ft. Eminem, Stuntin, This Is The Life, and Kill It ft. Governor.  As always track down those records the best way you know how because after all these tracks could have been included as a bonus disc or as part of the album*","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"I first heard Halsey when she opened for Imagine Dragons on the American leg of their current tour.  The crowd was already buzzing with anticipation for her performance, which intrigued me as I didn't know who she was.  She didn't disappoint; Halsey was the perfect lead in for the boys and got the audience good and ready.\n\nNow after a couple of EP releases- the latest of which featured tracks included on this one- she finally drops a full length release with Badlands.  And it was worth the wait.\n\nPeople seem impressed that she's diverse and well-versed enough to reference both Biggie and Nirvana (on her anthem song, Americana), but if you're of a certain age- or an extremely serious music head- you'll even catch the hook from M'tume's R&B classic, Juicyfruit (see if you can find it).  Now that's impressive!\n\nWhat I really like about Halsey is her lyrical imagery.  Even with the lesser songs- I really can't use a word like 'filler' to describe them- there's an emotionally powerful quality to them.  A seductive vulnerabilty- waifish, disaffected, headcase and femme fatale all at once.  Lines like \"I sold my soul to a three-piece, and he told me I was holy\/He's got me down on both knees, but it's the Devil that's trying to...\" Plus on Hurricane she refers to my part of Brooklyn as Bed(ford)-Stuy(vesant) and not its gentrified name, Bedford Hills.  Wasn't expecting that kind of depth from what I admit I thought would be just the latest pop queen on the scene.  Nope; this album is all about a woman who owns it, even when it scares her.  I just wish she'd use more real musicians and instruments on her songs; not that the beats and synths aren't listenable, but they're too Katy Perry\/Lorde\/Britney Spears-ish at times.  That almost sounds like an oxymoron, but that's because it's a very interesting and layered electronic landscape she paints.  I'd love to hear what she'd sound like with an actual band behind her.  I just don't understand the reluctance of talented people to work with actual instruments.\n\nThe standout cuts are: Hold Me Down, New Americana, Hurricane, Roman Holiday, Ghost, Colors & Strange Love.  You can definitely catch a synergetic flow to the tracks; apparently they're listed in the chronological order she wrote them, reflecting her growing maturity and confidence as a songwriter- which so happens to include using profanity.  What did catch me by surprise was her inclusion of the Johnny Cash staple, Walk the Line, to close things out.  Diverse and well-versed, indeed.  4.5\/5 stars.","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"With one of the cutest and most appealing album covers Ive seen in awhile, John Luttrells \"The Dream Exchange\" grabs your attention, piques your interest, and then soothes your stresses and worries away with close to an hour of warm, optimistic music that works seamlessly in the background or as music that flows in and out of close listening attention. Calling his music atmospheric music takes it in a somewhat different direction from new age or ambient because its both and yet neither from a purist standpoint. With elements of prog rock, the album features Luttrell on acoustic and electric guitars as well as keyboards with twelve songs that follow the theme of exchanging dreams. In the liner notes, Luttrell explains: Throughout our lives we share our dreams with family and friends, and they share their dreams with us. If we're lucky we can help them activate and achieve their dreams and also work on achieving our own. How wonderful it is to experience and share in this Dream Exchange. A lifelong musician who has lived and absorbed cultural influences from all over the world, Luttrells music reflects many of these influences and gives him a very distinctive sound.\n\n\"The Dream Exchange\" begins with Orange Sky, a piece that combines dreamy atmospheric sounds with a gently-floating guitar melody and a lively rhythm that comes and goes - a very effective opening! The Sphere contains a variety of styles and is possibly one of the more prog rock pieces. From Hawaiian guitar to electric rock guitar over ambient musical and atmospheric sounds, it has no hard edges while continuously evolving as it develops. Dreamcast is a favorite. Slow and graceful with a shimmering beauty, it reminds me of watching a sunset by the ocean. The title track opens with the sound of rain and thunder and then the electric guitar enters, evoking images of the sun breaking through the storm clouds. From there, guitars express tones of peaceful calm and tranquility - also a favorite. I love the title Somnambulistic Journey, and the misty, dreamy music is the perfect accompaniment to a peaceful sleepwalking expedition. Ethereal Raga combines a catchy rhythm and mysterious ambient sounds to create colorful images that dance slowly in atmospheric clouds - fascinating! Inland Returned is light and fanciful with acoustic and electric guitars leading the way with a gentle smile.

{"text":"so the dust has settled a little on the first year of dave's picks and i thought it would be fun to go back to the start [da.p#1]and revisit the mosque show from 5\/25\/77. one of 19 concerts that may, in one of the dead's most popular run of shows, i was somewhat skeptical of how this concert would stack up to the more famous, earlier in the month dates. well i was pleasantly surprised that it holds up very well indeed !! the night starts with a hot, mississippi half step,a very well played version which features lovely piano by keith about 1\/2 way through and then sweet guitar by jerry,...a great start. a very nice version of jack straw follows featuring pretty vocals by bobby, donna and jerry;; and again nice guitar  by jerry !! they love each other, slows the tempo down just a little but it's a pretty song. mexicali blues, is fun as always. peggy-o is another nice song that fits it's usual place in the first set. cassidy, continues the \"every other song\" pattern of up, then slower tempo tunes, a nice version which again features bobby and donna singing harmoniously. loser, is the last slow song for quite a while and it's a winner;;one of my favorite slow jerry songs. lazy lightnin'\/ supplication is hot and jazzy and gives hints of the far out places the band will go to later;; well done. brown eyed women and the promised land fit right in their regular first set slots in the show,, good versions. scarlet begonias \/ fire on the mountain finally stretches things out and jams beautifully. jerry again is shining on guitar and the whole band is rocking along in peak form. at a combined 21+ min. it's a nice long jam. then the centerpiece to the show, estimated prophet \/he's gone\/ drums\/ the other one\/ wharf rat\/ the other one\/ the wheel, must be the reason dave picked this show to start this new series.!!. the climax being the other one sandwich;[30 min.]; and did i read right this is the only one with wharf rat in the middle ????  you heads out there who have not heard this, need to !! this has quickly become my favorite other one, from 1977. the band is ON here !! powerful drums, great guitar, thundering bass, you know what i'm sayin' !!!! around and around ,, then johnny b.goode close out the show.. so,, if you can, cuz i see the prices here,, find a way to listen to this cd. i think you will put it high on your list, when you rate all the fine shows from 1977 .","classification":4,"fold":3}

{"text":"Ken Elkinson is a composer and multi-instrumentalist based in Los Angeles, California. As a young adult, he was part of the competitive Classical piano circuit, who later studied Jazz and Pop piano, picking up guitar, bass, saxophone, clarinet and French horn along the way.  In college, Ken took classes in music composition, percussion, recording studio techniques and improvisation to enhance his music education.  It was during this time he began work on his first original Solo Piano CD, Midnight Conversation, which was released in 1997.\n\nAfter 9 solo piano albums, Ken Elkinson decided to begin composing ambient music, and the result is a new 6 CD box set entitled Music For Commuting.  Featuring 60 tracks and over 4 hours of music, Music For Commuting has 3 double length CDs which represent progressive days of the week.  The music was composed specifically to help calm drivers while commuting, but his calming music is well suited for massage, yoga, meditation, and academic studies.\n\nOn this 6 CD collector's edition, Disc 1 Monday-Tuesday begins the work week in a deep and droning manner, as if shuttling the commuter through the hardest days of the week.  Disc 2 Wednesday-Thursday is much brighter while featuring upbeat, anthems and 1980's synth-pop elements.  Disc 3 is made for Friday and the weekend, taking the commuter into an enjoyable relaxing mode by spacey and futuristic music filled with a perfect sense of optimism.  Songs can be purchased by individual mp3 downloads.\n\nMusic For Commuting is an all instrumental mix of Ambient, Chill Electronica and New Age music, but most are from an ambient perspective with lighter melodies.  All 60 songs blend beautifully into one another, and Ken performed every note you hear, so there was no instrumental programming involved during production.  Ken Elkinson instead used a combination of 8 keyboards and synthesizers on this value packed collector's edition CD which enables the listener to arrive at their destination in a calm and relaxed attitude.","classification":5,"fold":3}

Usually by an artist's third album I'm already bored with them, but this one seems stronger than the last one.  The music is very similar to Madonna's Express Yourself in my opinion, and some people have criticized her for that. But I say, so what?  It's a great song, and anything that sounds like Madonna would be a great song anyway, so just let Lady Gaga do what she does.

{"text":"I have never been a fan of The Dixie Chicks; therefore, I didn't pay a lot of attention when I first heard that Emily Robinson and Martie Maguire were headed to the studio sans Natalie Maines.  I didn't care much for Maine's harsh, twangy vocals, but I am pleased to report that Court Yard Hounds have a much more melodic sound on their eponymous release.  The sound is much more akin to Sheryl Crow on Detours than The Dixie Chicks, and I am a huge Sheryl Crow fan.  The majority of the songs on Court Yard Hounds have that rootsy folk\/pop sound; however, it is for the most part mellow and subdued by way of comparison to Crow.  This collection of songs is very personal and deal with relationships and\/or loss and loneliness.  This is most on display in the middle of the CD with \"Fairytale\", \"I Miss You\", and \"Gracefully\".  There exceptions in both sound and subject.  The biggest departure is \"Ain't No Son\" which is the lone song that has a real twang to it, and its lyrical content reads like a father to a son giving it a bit of dissonance coming from Robinson and Maguire.  Even their twang, though, never reaches the irritating level of Maines.  The pleasant surprise is the almost Jerry Lee Lewis paced \"It Didn't Make A Sound\" with its rollicking piano the builds after the second verse.  Coming back to its core essence I thought that \"Fear Of Wasted Time\", \"The Coast\", and the Jacob Dylan duet \"See You In The Spring\" were standout tracks.  Robinson handles the lead vocals for the majority of the songs with Maguire lending harmony on the hooks.  When you add it up, Court Yard Hounds is a refreshing break that stands on its own merit as fine music.  While some CDs take time to warm up to, Court Yard Hounds grabbed a hold of me from the get go.  Think Sheryl Crow and not The Dixie Chicks, and you won't be disappointed.\n\nDownload this:  The Coast","classification":4,"fold":3}

In fact, they would be those brothers (yes, the Clipse are brothers) selling their albums out the trunk of their cars. I have never heard a song by them that just blew me away lyrically. Their hottest song to date, and one of my favorite rap songs to come out in recent years, is featured on this album: \"I'm Good.\" I really, really like that song and it's positive nature. The beat and hook are fantastic and their energetic, optimistic vibes make the song even better. Simply put, it's a feel good rap song.\n\nI lost count of how many times they mentioned their chains, how good their chains looked, and how bright their chains are. That's what stands out most after listening to these 13 tracks. I can say this matter-of-factly, though: The best tracks here are \"I'm Good\" and \"Champion.\" The rest of the album is basically the same as far as quality is concerned. \"Never Will It Stop\"and\"There Was a Murder\" are the LP's biggest most glaring missteps. These tracks are just all around bad. \"Showing Out\" is an energetic track if nothing else. It has an OK beat and a decent offering by Yo Gotti.\n\nI gave this album 2 1\/2 stars and I wonder if I was being too generous in doing so.

{"text":"I am not a big Alice Cooper fan but there are two of his songs that are awesome. I remember in 1989 when this song came out I thought the radio station I listened to would wear it out playing it all the time. The reason why I like this song is because it's not to hard rock or too pop, it's perfect. It has a great message and one you can play just about everywhere. I recommend this song too anybody even if your not a fan of Alice Cooper this song ROX. BTW another one of his I like is the song he did for Friday the 13th, Red Hot Summer, these two songs are is best.\n\nThanks,\nKris L. CocKayne","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"and while i may not say he's the best rapper alive.  I'm sure there are a few others out there right now just as good if not better than Wayne.  But not that many that bring the energy, lyrics and the flow that he does to each and every track.  Whether he's tearing up a track like \"A Milli\" or rapping about the virtues of a \"Lollipop\" or trading bars with Jay-Z on \"Mr. Carter\".\n\nWayne almost always brings you songs that are a both easily accessible, fun to listen and sometimes thought provoking like \"DontGetIt\" which is worthy of a few listen if only to hear him talk about various issues in the world and a certain person.  I also enjoyed \"Dr. Carter\" where he plays a doctor that specializes in resurrecting the lost skills of down and out rappers.  Whether he's rapping on his own with \"3Peat\" or with another artist \"Shot Me Down\" w\/D. Smith which is easily one of my favorites on the cd.  It's a slower, ballad style song with the vocals \"please don't shot me down\" being sung in the background to great effect.\n\nI'm glad Lil Wayne took his time with this cd before bringing it out despite the pressures of dropping the cd early. It gave him the time to come up with another great cd that should net him even more attention and respect throughout the music business.  You would think that with the number of songs on the cd that it wouldnt be that cohesive or together.  But it is that way minus a song or two and thankfully no interludes\/intros which i've never been a fan of at all.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Leela James released her new album \"My Soul\" a year after her all-covers album \"Let's Do It Again\". She does the perfect balance between traditional and contemporary- not bad for someone who is still in her mid-20's. The album starts off with \"I Ain't New To This\" in which she fancies herself as a music industry veteran, while taking a brief swipe at her former label Warner Bros. Records for their lack of promotion of her 2005 debut \"A Change Is Gonna Come\". Speaking of her debut album, one of the producers that worked on it appears on \"My Soul\"- Chucky Thompson, who produced the Raheem DeVaughn assisted \"Mr. Incredible, Ms. Unforgettable\" and the two 60's inspired tracks \"Party All Night\" and \"Let It Roll\". Andrea Martin, who also wrote Melanie Fiona's \"Give It To Me Right\" pens the first single \"Tell Me You Love Me\". Ray Murray (one-third of the production team Organized Noize) produces \"I Want It All\" which sounds a lot like N.E.R.D.'s song \"Don't Worry About It\" from their 2004 album \"Fly Or Die\". Orthodox & Ransum close the album with the songs \"If It's Wrong\" and \"It's Over\". This album is heavily rooted in retro soul, with the exception of \"Supa Lova\" and \"So Cold\" which sound like obvious attempts for commercial radio. In a nutshell, Leela's new album is pretty good, albeit rather brief. This album is a must own for this year.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I think it is the first single by Karyn White that I ever heard, and what an introduction it was!\n\nSUPERWOMAN is one of those songs that men and women remember because it reminds us of what happens in a relationship when things seem to be going wrong or when the feelings are one-sided. \"I'm not your superwoman,\" she sings. \"I'm only human.\" It's words like that which help us to understand that we can't read minds and we can't know what is wrong if the other person isn't willing to open up. \"I'm convinced I know the problem. You don't love me the same... You're not being fair.\" How many times have we felt that way? It's the words of this song and the melodic rhythm that accompanies it that really gets you to slow down and think about what she's saying---and what she makes you feel.\n\n\"Baby,look into the corner of your mind. I'll always be there for you, through good and bad times but I can't be that superwoman that you want me to be.\" With that Karyn seems to find her voice, letting the one she loves know that she's not able to be all things to him.\n\nPassionate and powerful, Karyn White's SUPERWOMAN speaks of vulnerability and strength, making it a single that will continue to stand the test of time.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nWith that said, I did pay for this this song.  If however, you are just looking to build a music library on a budget, I'd highly recommend checking out Amazon's free \/ cheap collection of music, featuring songs as well as albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies or really good digital music deals (69 cent songs, $5 albums!), you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Departments (drop down menu) --> Digital and Prime Music -->Deals --> Songs by Price \/ Albums by Price (on left side of screen)","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"While this would technically count as his fourth studio solo album,this is only my second Mayer Hawthorne solo purchase since his previous one. Of course in between that,the man did a collaborative project with hip-hop producer\/keyboardist Jake One on the self titled debut of their group Tuxedo. This was a full on mid 80's electro\/boogie style release showing off the musical versatility Hawthorne's throaty soul singing pipes are capable of. When this next solo album for the man was announced,it was very exciting for me to hear about. And needless to say I'm not the least bit disappointed.\n\nWith the Beach Boys\/Beatles like multi tracked harmonies of the title intro,\"Cosmic Love\" continues on with the stripped down electric piano based falsetto,melodic funky soul number. \"Book Of Broken Hearts\" has a thick bass\/guitar\/rhythm machine drum based grooving pop\/funk sound that continues with the more polished West Coast equivalent to that sound on \"The Valley\". Then there's the complex bass line on the reggae of \"Fancy Clothes\".The shuffling mid tempo \"Breakfast In Bed\" with it's singing horns and it's similar Marvin Gaye inspired \"Lingerie & Candlewax\" are belied by the thick keyboards on the amazing proto boogie groove of \"Love Like That. Not to mention the thick wah wah and horn based funk of the closer \"Out Of Pocket\".\n\nOn this album,this Ann Arbor singer\/songwriter\/producer\/multi instrumentalist continues to showcase his talents in a diverse array of settings. His primary focus continues to be polished,studiocentric jazzy pop\/funk with the California\/Philly twist of artists such as Steely Dan and Hall & Oates. Still he manages to write songs that can keep the listener grooving and humming along. With his emphasis on strong instrumentation along with his sense of pop craft,he is able to project the different tributaries of funk and soul that inspires him very effectively. And that continues to be a hallmark of his artistry in general that continues across this album.","classification":5,"fold":3}

For me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it's all you need....well maybe two, if You Want Blood from the Bon Scott era and one of the Brain Johnson era live discs.

{"text":"It's kind of hard to expound on Weezer's classic debut. In the aftermath of grunge and the death of Kurt Cobain, along came four noisy geeks who made the world safe for noisy hook laden songs about loudmouthed girlfriends (\"No One Else\"), the joys of high-school love (\"Buddy Holly\") and a great metaphor about an unraveling relationship (\"Undone - The Sweater Song\"). Along with seven other great songs, this was a first album that yielded some perennial material, and founded the cult that Rivers Coumo rides today.\nSo why should you pony up the extra dough for the \"expanded\" edition? Is the second disc really worth it? For a change, the answer is yes. You get four great live tracks, complete with some funny self depreciating comments, one song from a various artists rarities album that the band wrote about their lawyer (\"Jamie\"), and a handful of demos. The best of the bunch is an a cappella quickie titled \"My Evaline\" that highlights Weezer's uncanny harmony abilities, something occasionally lost in the din.\nIf you're reading this, you're probably already inclined towards buying this. Go ahead. Maybe we'll get lucky and \"Pinkerton\" will get the same royal treatment.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Ray of the dawn scatters sleep\nAnd fear disappears like a shadow.\n\nThis strong electronic music captures the listener from the very beginning because it comes from the bottom of the artist's heart. You leave your habitual room and start the unusual journey. Its uncommonness is that it is a spiritual voyage. You are able to feel your inner self with all your true desires and yearnings, to realize the endlessness of the surrounded world and the space within you. This music helps to break the shell from the physical world in order to feel the spiritual world which is multidimensional.\n\nThe artist wrote: \"...the album is neither about the event [the Hiroshima atomic bomb tragedy] nor propaganda against the nuclear weapon. It is my imaginary story of someone who died in the event and is going through the unknown spiritual world.\" These words beautifully describe the music of the album. Each of its compositions is like a painted picture, it has completeness and smoothly flows into the next one.\n\nTakashi Suzuki is a perfect composer. His music has a healing feature and inspires contemplation. It is easy to be in harmony with your emotional experiences while listening to \"Voyage\". Moreover, this music assists to strengthen the spirit and cures the tired heart. It has its own very special flavor.\n\nListen to \"Voyage\" without fail. This trip will not be an idle stroll, it will allow you to experience another world that is the reality itself.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I have been a fan of Adam Lambert since his gig on American Idol ... from the very beginning, he drew me in with his soulful voice and incredible lyrical interpretation.  I have loved, appreciated and supported all of his music but not until \"Ghost Town\" can I say that this is Adam's best ever!  The juxtaposition of the dark lyrics with the driving house\/dancey rhythmic beat make it irresistible to the listener and the dancer.  The upbeat tempo doesn't allow you to wallow in the black hole of the somber lyrics ... it beckons you to embrace both willingly.  \"Ghost Town\", explicit or clean is going to be the SMASH HIT of the long, hot summer!

{"text":"Who better to supply the song for upcoming James Bond movie Skyfall than Adele? No one - it's a rhetorical question.  Adele proved herself a soulful force when album 19 dropped and confirmed it with near diamond selling album 21, which also won album of the year.  Her soulful voice that encompasses R&B, pop, and alternative sensibilities is perfect to capture the sultry, mysterious nature that has come to characterize title cuts from James Bond movies.  \"Skyfall\" is no different, finding the chanteuse delivering a one-two punch that is unrivaled.\n\nVocally, Adele sounds brilliant, accentuating every nuance and crevice of her voice exceptionally.  The songwriting (Adele\/Paul Epworth) is well conceived, with the chorus being perhaps most notable, unifying the cut. \"Let the sky fall, when it crumbles\/We will stand tall, face it all together\/let the sky fall, when it crumbles\/we will stand tall, face it all together, at skyfall,\" Adele sings on the chorus.  The second iteration adds though signature backing vocals that have made Adele's studio work excel.  Brilliant and lush production just add sweetness to this top ten gem. As good as anything as Adele has released.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"From Sequence to Vertical Hold to a five million-selling solo career, for over 30 years Angie Stone has been nothing if not a reliable talent. Entering the more seasoned years of her career, Stone still strikes a spirited figure in R&B and traditional soul. More favorite aunt than voluptuous seductress at this point in her legend, Stone inexplicably manages to keep her music current without losing the classic elements that make her an assured buy for fans who have stood by her from No More Rain (In This Cloud) to I Aint Hearing You. With close harmonies, open melodies, and enough familiar love and pain testimonies to maintain Angies place in soul royalty, Rich Girl is another competent ribbon break that proves the race is not given to the swift but to those respected underdogs who endureth til the end.\n\nThere are few better at working and knowing the strengths and limitations of their instrument than Angie Stone. She has just enough of everything listeners need to draw you them and keep them around for breakfast. Her deepening alto has just enough raspiness to suggest Gladys Knight, just enough power to reference the church, just enough hip hop to give her street cred, and just enough silk to coat each carefully arranged melody line to maximize the emotional impacts of her familiar relationship messages. While shes more earthbound that stratospheric in her range, that Stone still has a consistent voice helps prevent this multi-producer\/multi-singerwriter project from sliding into the forgettable. Nonetheless, this is not to say Rich Girl is exactly a classic either.\n\nThis project continues Stones more recent record for co-penning and co-producing solid material, but the hooks are a little less infectious than those in her halcyon #1 dance hit days of Andrea Martin and Ivan Matiass Wish I Didnt Miss You and R&B anthems like Brotha. The staple performances of mid-tempo jams like Alright, Rich Girl, First Time and Right In Front of Me, are enjoyable, but just shy of must-listen artistry. The bumping music and driving arrangement of such feel-good tracks like Korey Bowie and Demond Mickens Livin It Up certainly arduously work to turn up the eyes on the stove. However, while they're enough to tease a smile out of you while sitting in traffic, they are not enough to get you to sing along. Channeling Betty Wright in its educational message (every woman needs a back-up plan), the Mike City co-created disco funk number Backup Plan (with the near-Nile Rogers guitar) does its part to conjure the spirit of Chic but the chorus doesnt have the Studio 54 swing of an otherwise finger-popping grooveline. Some, like the Corey Co-T Tatum co-produced nursery rhyme melody of I Can Take It with its vague Motown appeal, don't even try to win listeners over.\n\nAs with 2009s Unexpected, ballads here fare better. The retro-soul of Freedom Lyles Guilty isn't milked for all its dramatic, cheating heart potential, but its still a classic Angie Stone old school cry. A gospel flavored collaborative tune boasting Tweet, Danetra Moore, daughter Diamond Stone and Sunday Best-winner Yanna Crawley  on Sisters walks away with the gold for the song on the album to beat. Pregnant with emotion and a rare project display of impressive vocal range, the ladies push each other on the womans anthem to dizzying effect. Sisters is the five-finger discount worthy steal of the project. The womens empowerment hook on Joy Campbell and James Owens co-crafted Proud of Me and Yanna Crawleys co-penned self-care ode, Do What U Gotta Do, tie for a best of award for choruses worth your money in inspiration. All offer a quiet reminder of what traditional soul music is truly about.\n\nWith album sales that have steadily declined from her gold-selling early days with Black Diamond and Mahogany Soul, Stone still earns respectable tallies for equally respectable music for fans longing for real instrumentation and tired of the profanity and the needlessly provocative of radio R&B. In a previous review, I once likened Angie Stones music to comfort food. This go-round, listeners may not ask for seconds and thirds, but youll always leave pleasantly full from Stones heaping helpings of timeless musicianship and loads of Stone love.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"\"Help!\" is the Beatles' 1965 soundtrack album to their first color movie, and, like all Beatles albums, it's a must-have. The Fab Four's music continues to evolve and the production work gets a bit more sophisticated with this one, though the pop ditties and love songs are still there (but hey, nothing wrong with that!). This album has many Beatles favorites on it, including the title song written by John Lennon (apparently a personal cry for assistance, as Lennon was under a considerable amount of pressure at this time, being a world-famous Beatle and all, and poured his heart out about it in this classic pop song). There's also the rockin' fun of Paul McCartney's \"The Night Before,\" Lennon's beautiful \"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away,\" and George Harrison's excellent \"I Need You.\" \"Help!\" also features my personal favorite Beatles song of *all-time*, the brilliant pop-rocker \"Ticket To Ride\" (this was also the very first Beatles song I ever heard as a child, as my sister had an old 45 single of it). It really is an awesome, jamming song, and it still stands today as my personal favorite tune from the Fab Four. Drummer Ringo Starr shines brightly in his country-esque spotlight song, \"Act Naturally,\" Lennon serves up the lovely \"It's Only Love,\" and then, of course, there's McCartney's timeless ballad, \"Yesterday.\" Yes, it's been played on the radio to death, and yes, there are WAY too many cover versions of it out there (PLEASE, recording artists of the world, no more cover versions of \"Yesterday.\" PLEASE). But every time I play the \"Help!\" album, and \"Yesterday\" comes on---with the one-and-only Paul McCartney singing it---I am entranced. It remains, no matter how many times you've heard it, one of the most beautiful ballads ever written, and Paul McCartney is the ONLY human being on the entire planet who can do justice to it. Finally, John Lennon leads the lads in a rousing, rockin' finale, \"Dizzie Miss Lizzie.\" From start to finish, \"Help!\" is yet another jewel in the Beatles' musical crown.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"1987's \"Fishin' in the Dark\" was the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's third, and last (..so far), #1 single.  Having made the move from SoCal folk-rock band in the late 60's to Nashville-based country band by the early 80's, NGDB never fully lost its roots and is often credited with influencing the modern country-crossover movement.\n\nYou certainly hear those blended influences in \"Fishin' in the Dark\", which marries the toe-tapping twang of mid-80's Nashville country with the vocal harmonies of earlier SoCal folk-rockers like the Mamas and Papas.  The result is a landmark cross-over song that is both simple to listen to, and delightful to revisit.","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"Five CLASSIC Stars? No, easily a SIX! A one word Review? SPECTACULAR! An Essential Recording for any serious jazz collection. The big difference here is intensity and Tony Williams. The addition of the teenage drumming genius Tony Williams was a brilliant acquistion by Miles and it revitalized the quintet with his youthful freshness and orchestral cunning. And Davis formed one of the greatest rhythm sections in jazz history, along with the amazing pianism of Herbie Hancock on piano and the redoubtable Ron Carter on bass. Future \"NEA Jazz Master\" George Coleman, who synthesized Coltrane and Rollins into a personal style, was also a great 'get' for the quintet (beating out Frank Strozier, I'm told). And they play like dervishes on this CD, finally released at a sensible price for such a classic recording.\n\nAll performances are the \"Pieces D'Resistance\" of this disc. \"Autumn Leaves\" is FANTASTIC, both individually and collectively. Mile's muted solo is so fresh, relaxed, and inventive. Coleman's solo, composed of packets of notes, packs a powerful punch leading to a crescendo, opening the door for Hancock's relentlessly brilliant, rhythmically varied solo with some great block chording. Note the fascinating musical conversation between Hancock and Williams at the beginning of the piano solo, before it surges back into 4\/4. Carter's arco bass solo is equally brilliant. But Williams is operating on a level of jazz drumming on a par with the greatest drum masters, driving and inspiring the musicians to new heights during their solos. WOW!! I've listened to this song for decades and it still amazes me. But this was just the beginning...enter \"Milestones\".\n\nWe've heard \"Milestones\" a million times but Miles has concocted a new version for this occasion. It begins at a breathtaking pace, with a unison head that is not the usual toss-away head that Miles was sometimes fond of. \"Get it over with and let's get to the solos.\" Not this time. The quintet is on top of 'all things unison'. Mile's fiery solo is one of his best up-tempo solos ever, Coleman's ribbon of sound solo is fascinating, leading to Hancock's truly spectacular solo. All pushed along by the brilliant rhythm trio, especially future DownBeat Hall of Fame member Williams. A fabulous performance.\n\n\"Joshua\" is in a similar vein as \"Milestones\", but Miles had a plan. \"Joshua\" is distinct and invigorating with choppy rhythmic breaks delineated by Williams' rim shots. Note how Miles stops in mid-solo, almost as a challenge (\"What cha' gonna' do now, guys?\"), and Carter and Hancock rush to fill in the pause before Miles surges back to finish an AWESOME solo. And Hancock's solo is 'too much'. After you listen to it, go back and key in on Tony Williams' performance, he is formidable!!\n\n I could go on describing each excellent individual track. Later, Miles was so impressed that he made coast to coast telephone calls to Ralph Gleason to play and rave about certain parts of the recording, especially what Tony Williams was doing on the drums. For one known to be so self-critical, Miles was blown away by this quintet's live performance! So am I and I have been listening to this recording for decades! This is a CLASSIC recording, jazz fans,  A Real Keeper. Six SIZZLING Stars !!!","classification":5,"fold":3}

{"text":"I was so thrilled when their reunion album finally happened.  I did not, however, expect it to exceed classics such as All Over The Place and Different Light, and it doesn't, but the songs are as fresh as if hearing them for the first time ever.  After fifteen years... Wow!  Getting this prevented me from tearing off my own head, to paraphrase the leading song. Key=[lead vocalist]\nAfter the phrase, \"One must tear off one's own head,\" comes a quick burst of snarling punkish guitar and Susanna's familiar sugary voice.  I haven't heard the original Elvis Costello version, but they really jam on \"Tear Off Your Own Head (Doll Revolution)\"  This opening number makes this yet another classic in the Bangles pantheon of hits.\n\"Stealing Rosemary\" is a simple song of a woman doing the title action for her man.  What, without parsley, sage, and thyme?  Kidding.  [Debbi]\n\"Something That You Said\" is another classic, with the solid Beatles\/Byrds influence heard with the guitar and the harmony vocals.  The drum machine in the background paints a modern addition.  And Susanna's voice never sounded so good!\n\"Ask Me No Questions\" has rhythmic overtones of the Beatles \"Rain\" without the feedback guitar.  The main chorus goes \"Oh, I'm in love with you\/But I turn away when you look in my eyes\/Ask me no questions I'll tell you no lies.\" [Debbi]\n\"Rain Song\" sung by Vicki is an upbeat guitar-oriented number where when it rains, she remembers her ex.  And there's a bitter taste with this line:  \"I'm doing fine as long as you stay locked up\/Inside a cloud of grey\"  Whoa! [Vicki]\nThat's quite a fancy dresser in \"Nickel Romeo\", someone who's described as \"a Cheshire cat in yellow Beatle boots\".  \"Strange desperation-you gotta cop that fix\/Making every little girl is keeping you alive.\"  That bad, huh?  [Michael]\n\"Ride The Ride\" has a similar beat but less ferocious than \"Doll Revolution\".  With signature guitar hooks, call it a close cousin to \"In Your Room\" [all]\nJust what I needed, another tender ballad to melt my heart, and my favourite song here.  \"I Will Take Care Of You\" is an affirmative song of support from a loved one who will stand tall alongside through times of fear and sadness:  \"Smile, if you can now\/Smile through your tears\/Here where your fears are known\/\nKnow you're safe at home.\"  Magic! [Susanna, of course!]\nGuitar and soundwise, the upbeat \"Here Right Now\" sounds like Green-era R.E.M. and calls for one to slow down.  \"Stand back and take a look around you\/Running from the pressures of a restless world\/Hush for a moment, baby, just be still\/Here now.\/Spend a minute next to me.\"  Amen to that!\nThe woman in bittersweet \"Single By Choice\" is affirmative of the title, adding \"Never marry, never ever divorce\/Listen to the solitary voice.\"  Even though she gives bad experiences she had, sad, isn't it? [Vicki]\n\"Lost At Sea\" details a couple who's lost so far in arguments that it's as if they are lost at sea.  The solution:  \"Take my hand, come to me\/Save a life, rescue you, rescue me.\"  Another Byrdsy song replete with harmonies. [Vicki]\n\"Song For A Good Son\" details a woman explaining to her son why she seems emotionally cold.  She is scarred by the loss of her mother, taken by the ocean current.  There are suicidal overtones:  \"Waterside so deep and wide\/If I follow, maybe I will find her.\" [Michael]\n\"Grateful\" is a lullaby to one's young son, enhanced by chorus harmonies of \"All we are and all we need is\" while Susanna's whispery sweet voice does lead.\nThe bonus DVD contains \"A Day In The Life Of The Bangles\" mini-documentary, which basically explains how they felt about getting back together, story behind \"TOYOH\", and their amazement at the large fan base they had, the \"Something That You Said\" video, audio and lyrics pages.\nAll the familiar elements are there, Susanna's sweet voice, the tight harmonies, the 60's rock influenced sound, the brand of garage pop\/rock hybrid.  It's as if they never broke up.  A warm welcome back!","classification":5,"fold":3}

Unfortunately, after I Kissed A Girl, she hasn't really shown herself enough to be a credible singer. Her second single Hot N' Cold, from her debut album One Of The Boys doesn't really feel like it clicks to the listeners' ear. I wasn't really impressed with the strength of the song. It actually felt more like it was a glass of near rancid milk, mixed in with a steaming cup of coffee. She really needs to find catchier songs than this one. Katy really feels like a cold shoulder, and hopefully her next song can really feel more like it is a better bag of tricks.\n\nSong: D-","classification":2,"fold":3}

{"text":"There is no question that Ed Sheeran really has let his sound go in his songs. While he has been more influenced by rap and hip hop acts like Jay-Z and others, it really hasn't brought out better in his music. In fact, it feels more like it has wasted his heart in his music. I was not a fan of Sing when it came out earlier this year, but his latest song Don't definitely is the pits. It is one of his worst songs that he has brought out. The second single from his X record is definitely one of those songs that can drive a artists down when they be experimental on a sophmore record. While Sing was fair, Don't doesn't deliver. He needs to find better in his work. I think if he is going make better in his craft, he should consider going back to songs like Lego House and The A Team. While his main influence has been in rap and hip hop, it really has dragged down his work.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":3}

It is a beautiful song but the background vocals, the firing of the MK-47's and M16's and jumps off into a whole different song. The history of this moving melody is as interesting as the song itself. Unfortunately, trying to find an unadulterated version of it may be just about impossible to come by. I'm debating about the \"In The Style of\" album, which may contain it, but can't confirm it. The writer and musical group (Clann An Drumma) don't have it for sale.

But trying to follow-up the success she has had with songs like Roar and California Gurls hasn't been a very strong feeling. Most of the songs she has came out with haven't been very strong, and felt very weak at the heart. Her last song Dark Horse with Juicy J was terrible, and not really a very good song. Her latest song, Birthday, the third single from her lagging Prism record tries to bring in the party-style anthem she hasn't been able to bring in with her voice work and heart. Sadly, the song feels like it has been what she has done before, old and washed up. Katy Perry needs to find better in her voice and at heart, and then she could feel like we're celebrating more birthdays, loving her music.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":3}

It is so sad because she hasn't even made music that spoke from the soul, and instead tried to pull out another surprise as a product, than the person on the inside. Her Lemonade album has been more like a joke than a stand. Sadly though, she has shown some real cracks unveiled in her personal life. I didn't find the song Formation to impress me at all, and it was more of a joke than a real stand. Sorry, her latest single from Lemonade really takes shots at the two men in her life, her estranged husband Jay-Z and her separated father Matthew Knowles, for cheating on her, and her mother Tina. I found the song to be very poor at soul and didn't impress me at all, and shows that Beyonce' Knowles still hasn't grown as a singer. Perhaps she should take a listen to Gwen Stefani and what she made as a album about being cheated on before hers came out. Sorry is a bust, and Beyonce' Knowles should consider retiring.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":3}
