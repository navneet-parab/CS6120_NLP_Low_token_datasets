{"text":"When it has came down to Mariah Carey these days, it has been more about her personal life, than the stride of the music she wants to sing. It is very sad that she has not been able to honestly ignite within her songs, the way other great divas did before her like the great Whitney Houston, or Anita Baker. Tragically after she left Sony for other offers in the 90's, When she made it in the 2000's, the only album that really delivered with her fans really was The Emancipation Of Mimi, and none of the albums have been able to stride in musicality and soul. When she released her album, Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel, it was really more of a dud than a sense of the brilliance she used to have. The songs completely have been a waste of time. Obsessed was really the only hit song for her die hard fans, but it wasn't enough. Musically, the song wasn't strong enough the way that she had with songs like We Belong Together or Shake It Off. Obsessed was a real failure, and one Mariah Carey song that really is a stinker.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":7}

That one does, however, have three or four stand-out songs sprinkled in among the snoozers. This new Blood set has a harder time pumping them out.\n\nThe soundscape is, again, vintage in nature. Havas makes deep soul music that couldve just as well come from long before she was born. Its her vocal melodies, essentially the songs themselves, that disappoint. Midnight and Tokyo are mild highlights, but What You Dont Do is dumb and most of the others are bland.\n\nmarcellee.com","classification":3,"fold":7}

But Michele has had honestly the most to prove after the trio broke up in voice. If We Had Your Eyes, the latest song from Michelle is not a bad song, but not actually as striking as other songs. Still it is a very uplifting song that speaks well from Michelle. Still, it isn't one of her better songs, but at least it is much better than the lackluster songs that have been on radio.

In 1980, CAPITOL released this American RARITIES LP (SHAL-12060) with a quite different playlist (a notorious habit of that company dating back to 1964, but well justified in this instance). To my Yankee ears, the US \"Rarities\" is superior (EMI's is mostly Beatlemania songs in mono) and the packaging is hands down the winner.\n\nInstead of a flimsy generic plain blue outer jacket, CAPITOL's heavier gatefold is packed with numerous visual delights, not least of which is a full-sized repro of the uncropped \"butcher smock\" photo that was briefly cover art for&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/YESTERDAY-AND-TODAY\/dp\/B000LYUXYI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">YESTERDAY AND TODAY<\/a>&nbsp;compilation. There's also an unairbrushed snapshot of the hotel room picture (with Paul in steamer trunk) that soon replaced it. Additionally, the glossy paper LP sleeve is nicely adorned with a total of 32 square-shaped b&w \"snaps\" that casually chronicle the band's career.\n\nSIDE ONE NOTES\n1.) On the group's first session with George Martin, the producer was unsure of Ringo Starr's abilities so he hired Andy White to play drums, with Ringo relegated to tambourine. This alternate version of \"Love Me Do\" has Ringo at the sticks, and no tambourine. 2.) \"Misery\" is an early track on VEE-JAY's mono&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/INTRODUCING-THE-BEATLES\/dp\/B004A6BRT8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">INTRODUCING THE BEATLES<\/a>&nbsp;album, and was also released on pre-CAPITOL 45s. 3.) Ditto #2. 4.) In the U.S., a SWAN label 45,  in Germany it was partnered with \"Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand\" on a 45 issued in January of '64. 5.) Alternate take with a six-bar ending. 6.) A different vocal from the stereo LP track. 7.)

An amalgam of US singles and UK album mixes. This created \"Walrus\" has a six-bar intro and extra beats before \"Yellow matter custard...\" The transition to rechanneled mono which occurs two minutes in is done as an easy segue rather than an abrupt shift, as it is on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/MAGICAL-MYSTERY-TOUR\/dp\/B005E0CDTC\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR<\/a>.\n\nSIDE TWO NOTES\n1.) This dub of the German stereo version ncludes a tagged on piccolo trumpet at the end that was only on US and Canadian radio station promo singles. 2.) From the unique mono mix WHITE ALBUM, not available in the US. There's laughing at the start, beeps heard throughout and different drumming at the end. The track ends at the first fade, thus eliminating Ringo's \"I've got blistahs on mah fingahs!\" 3.) Another mono WHITE ALBUM cut, it's sped up and includes alternate violin riffs. 4.) Liner notes indicate there's no known stereo mix of this \"Lady Madonna\" 'B' Side, but the PAST MASTERS: VOLUME TWO track is a slightly different true stereo version. 5.) Stereo \"World Wildlife Fund\" mix (pre-Phil Spector's overdubbed strings) has birdwing SFX at the beginning. 6.) Released 3\/70 as the flip of \"Let It Be,\" this zaniest of all Fab Four tracks was originally planned for an 'A' side, also inclusion on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/WHITE-ALBUM\/dp\/B00B40R7RO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">WHITE ALBUM<\/a>.

{"text":"Apart from a couple of reviews from way back around the turn of the century, whose authors hear flaws in this recording that I do not, nearly everyone concurs that ever since their recording fifty years ago, these performances have remained unequalled and unassailable. Of course there are are other excellent recordings of all three pieces (Giulini's \"Pictures\" with the Chicago SO and his \"La mer\" with the Philharmonia, for example) but as a collection this is a testament to both the sonority of the Berlin Philharmonic at its peak under Karajan and to that conductor's chameleon ability to empathise with and elucidate music from outside the late German Romantic tradition in which he excelled. His brief dalliance with the Orchestre de Paris confirms his attachment to French music and his ability to pace and colour both the Debussy and the Ravel emerges as a thing of wonder.\n\nThere is of course a neat link in the programming here between the Mussorgsky and \"Bolro\" as the composer of the latter orchestrated the \"Pictures\" brilliantly; originally these recordings, made between 1964 and 1966 in the warm ambiance of the Jesus-Christus-Kirche, were issued on two separate LPs, one of French music by Debussy and Ravel and the other with just the Mussorgsky and \"Bolro\". Any attempt at musical criticism of such seminal recordings would be superfluous after such a long time; it is sufficient to note that the delicacy and nuance of Karajan's evocation of the sea remain extraordinary, and the peroration of the \"Pictures\" in \"The Great Gate of Kiev\" remains one of the greatest expositions of the symphony orchestra in full flight ever committed to disc.","classification":5,"fold":7}

This is only the second album in the band's 40+ year career not to feature Jon Anderson which caused a divide in fandom. People seem to either love or hate this album and I love it. I think the problem comes from the fact that the band was set to tour with Jon but he developed health problems so the band hired a replacement and went off without him. I'm not saying that all Yes fans who don't like this album are doing it because of what happened but I do think that it plays into some of it. The album is fantastic!!! The title song, Fly From Here is an epic which stands up well against other Yes big numbers. The rest of the album is pretty great as well.

{"text":"If Mott the Hopple didn't help invent punk, they certainly were the midwives that helped with the delivery. Mott was a unique band--with they were never less than soulful even on their weakest material. Ian Hunter's Sonny Bono\/Bob Dylan delivery gave an impression of what the Pretty Things or Stones would have sounded like with either one of those singer\/songwriters as their front man.\nMott is a nearly flawless album. Hunter came into his own as a songwriter. I Wish I was Your Mother, All the Way to Memphis and Ballad of Mott (co-written with all the band members) all manage to capture Hunter's gritty and blunt assessment of the world packaged in a melodic and colorful box.\nRalphs contributes a couple of strong tracks as well although his contributions are a bit more subdued than on All the Young Dudes. Clearly Hunter had taken Bowie's advice and stepped to the forefront as both frontman and songwriter. This managed to make the band better and also caused the original line up to splinter with Hunter the next casuality.\nThe problem with this great album is the sound quality. The CD sounds flat and muddy. When you compare the sound quality here to the remastered editions of both All the Young Dudes and The Hoople, it's clear that this album is in bad need of a facelift. If you're a fan of the band let Sony\/Columbia know that this needs all the attention, remixing and remastering that was applied to both the selections from the box set and the other two MTH Columbia studio albums.\nOh, and pick up Hunter's Rant. He's in fine form again and it's evident he hasn't lost his edge.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I have a few Gregorian chant albums although I'm far from knowledgeable about the intricacies of Gregorian chant as a musical form. This is a fine collection of chants, and I particularly like that full works, including full masses, are included.\n\nI haven't been able to find too much on the performers, but the first 31 tracks are by the Collana Diretta da Bonifacio G. Baroffio, conducted by Enrico de Capitani. Father Bonifacio G. Baroffio was Choir Master of the Choir of the Sistine Chapel for a while, so if the group is really associated with him that would seem pretty credible.\n\nI enjoy the fact that their \"Missa Angelis\" features prominent singing parts for women. So many of the big hit Gregorian chant albums of recent years (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Chant\/dp\/B000002SKX\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Chant<\/a>) have been performed by monks only, so it's sometimes easy to lose sight of the fact that Gregorian chants were also sung by nuns and indeed by mixed choirs.\n\nThe \"Congregation of St. Lazarus Autun\" appears to be made up of members of the congregation of a church -- actually the Cathedral Saint-Lazare in Autun, France. They perform nearly two thirds of the total album, and the performances seem good and satisfying so far.\n\nIt looks like only one of the tracks on this set has appeared in a previous \"99\" collection -- the \"Darkest\" set, so things look good in terms of repetition, which can be a problem with these sets. Total download size is 616 MB for 6.1 hours of music. Bitrates are variable and average between 203 and 242 kbps.\n\nRecommended at the bargain price!","classification":5,"fold":7}

Even worse, \"Sam's Town\" was trying to make a genuine serious declaration here, but really didn't have a lot to say. It appears to be all style, but not a lot of soul. The album never takes off due to it's gloomy writing and hooks that aren't nearly as well-defined as their debut album \"Hot Fuss.\" A sophomore slump perhaps? I give them points for not trying to repeat themselves musically, they just needed to work a bit longer on it.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"I am not a fan of Miley Cyrus' music but I have liked a few of her pop songs in the past.  This song rings more R&B pop than say Party in the USA.  I am way older than her usual fan base but this song is more soulful which attracted me to it initially.  The music is slow and the track is okay.  The melody is easy to follow but the phrasing was weird for me to follow at first--almost too simplistic and awkwardly put together for lack of something (?).  I was asked if I had seen the video by my daughter who is Miley's age and it is very disappointing--way too skanky for my taste and it totally takes away from the loving aspect of this song.  Otherwise the song is okay and her vocals are not challenged in anyway by high notes are vocal riffs.  It is just okay.","classification":3,"fold":7}

I do believe that 311 has created other musically gripping rock songs such as Down, Amber, Tread On Me, Dont Stay Home, Come Original,Love Song etc. It is just that for some reason,I admit that All Mixed Up and this song; Beautiful Disaster are two of my favorite songs from 311.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I confess that I was actually stationed in North Island California when I first heard this emotionally soothing song that is Somewhere I Belong by Linkin Park by the 2004 timeframe. A coworker kindly made a copy of the Linkin Park cd Meteora music collection from a computer and Somewhere I Belong happens to be one of my favorite songs from the Meteora collection even to this day. I rationally and intuitively understand that Somewhere I Belong is one of those songs that has a different meaning depending on who hears it andor who created it. However, I take Somewhere I Belong to be a constructive tune about simply wanting to feel andor be where spiritually, personally, andor psychologically belonging can happily occur (simply guessing from the lyrics I want to heal could imply various levels of healing-emotionally psychological spiritual etc.).","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Over two years after Robin Gibb passed away, his last solo album is released with some songs nearly ten years old. These were written between the years of 2004-2008 with the hope of using some as part of a Bee Gees reunion with Barry. That was not to be.\n\nThe listener does get treated to an array of some of Robin Gibb's best music to date. It's much more upbeat in style and verse than previous Gibb compositions and the result is wonderful. Relying mostly on electronic equipment, it's tough to tell that most of the instruments are electronic. Robin's voice is more reedy than usual with a higher pitch, but that only tends to pulls the listener in closer. This is Robin Gibb at his most vulnerable and intimate self.\n\nWith a hefty dose of seventeen songs, Robin Gibb concentrates on layered songs backed with a strong beats. In fact, only two songs, 'Solid' and 'All We Have Is Now' are the only slower ballads and they stand up to any previous Gibb tearjerker. One of the standout cuts that are worthy of single treatment are 'Alan Freeman Days' with its excitable exclamatory proclamations. 'I Am The World' is a remix of the 1966 B-Side vocal and it's a layered composition that stands up to modern tastes and styles. 'Broken Wings' contains a danceable beat that begs for an extended version, if not a single release. The instrumental sections and backing vocals are synthesized genius. 'Avalanche', a title taken from a 1970 song is an anthemic upbeat journey of a song with powerful backing vocals.\n\n'Mother Of Love' is presented in its original form and is a nice respite from the bevy of strong songs, but what it lacks in structure, it makes up in pure emotion. 'Don't Cry Alone' is a wonderful reminder of Robin and RJ Gibb's classical hybrid, Titanic Requiem'. The closing cut, 'Sydney' is one of the saddest songs I think I've heard any Gibb brother sing. Reportedly recorded on an iPad with sparse working, the lyrics and the yearning vocal tug at your heart when you realize what Robin is singing about - a loss of innocence and younger times. It's the perfect finish for this album.\n\nWith a nice cardboard sleeve and notes from his wife Dwina, this makes for a fan special. Note that the Isle Of Man Post Office is releasing a limited edition of this album (1,000 copies) with an accompanying DVD. Robin Gibb deserves this and more. Thank you Robin.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Now, she is trying it again with her song Sorry, from her upcoming album One Woman Army. Sadly, the song isn't as driven as she could've made it with her earlier songs. I really didn't find sorry to be so strong. It lacked in making it all the way home in voice. I really think Ciara needs to find a better tune when One Woman Army comes out. If more songs are going to be poorly made, than Ciara will lose her element. Hopefully, the next single from her upcoming record could be more than Sorry.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"This scarcely needs a review because after 50 years practically everyone will know whether or not they like the Stones and most people considering this collection will know all the tracks on it very well indeed. It is worth saying, though, that this is a great collection. Obviously, any compilation like this will have some tracks you love and some you don't like so much, and some of your favourites will be missing (What - no Sister Morphine or Star...er...Star?) but as a \"Best Of\" collection I don't think you can do better. It is well selected and sounds fantastic: the digital transfers of the early stuff are particularly good and bring real life to the tracks without interfering with their original sound.\n\nI suspect that quite a lot of people considering whether or not to buy this will be in the same position as I am: I have a lot of Stones music on LP and cassette and for me this was a good way of getting some of the best of it on CD. You certainly get plenty of great stuff, and personally I found listening to this was like running my life on fast forward from the age of about 10, with pretty well every track conjuring up where I was at the time. It's also great to hear the evolution of the band from the early covers, through finding their distinctive identity around the time of Satisfaction and through all their phases since. Although I haven't always liked the direction they have taken, this is a reminder that the Rolling Stones really are one of the finest bands of the last 50 years and that Jagger and Richards are a truly great songwriting team. The full range of classics is here, from the storming rockers like Jumpin' Jack Flash through to the hauntingly beautiful Angie. Also included is their new (November 2012) single Doom And Gloom which I think is excellent - a real Stones belter and one of their best tracks in ages.\n\nThe question, of course, is \"Do I need another Stones Greatest Hits album?\" the answer to which will depend on your own view and the state of your music collection. For me it's a great summary of their career containing some of my favourite ever tracks, and has made them available to me in CD format. If you want a good, well put-together collection of The Rolling Stones, you can't go wrong with this set.\n\nIn short, it's only rock 'n roll, but...","classification":5,"fold":7}

This song actually has substance to it, as opposed to just saying, \"I love you\", or \"I adore you\". There is nothing inherently wrong with that, but when that's all a worship song says, it becomes empty, in a way.\n\nThis song is specifically a praise song in praise of what the Lord has done for us in dying on the cross for our sins. The chorus gives a clear, complete gospel message, from His birth to His ascension to heaven.\n\nI like this particular rendition of Lord, I Lift Your Name On High because Petra does this song in such a way that is uniquely Petra.","classification":5,"fold":7}

It's not unwarranted though since Drake has the talent and the songs to back up his hype.  So Far Gone EP is nothing new however it gives fans a chance to own a real copy (or half copy at least) of one of the best mixtapes released in the past few years. The song that defined the summer appears here and for those not in the loop it's BEST I EVER HAD.  SUCCESSFUL is also on here in it's original glory (even though Trey Songz had to jack that for his album...I'm not mad).  The other songs are top notch as well which is why the EP has earned 5 stars.\n\nHowever, this EP is only for those that are new to Drake or like to have official things in their collection since So Far Gone The Mixtape came out over 5 months ago and contains more songs.  The one new song FEAR is included.  I admit I didn't buy the EP simply because this week I already put down for the Kid Cudi, Lil Boosie, and Trick Daddy.  But having listened to these songs for months it's easy for me to say that the EP is worth the measly $6 or $7 that you spend on it.

{"text":"The magnificent Dead Or Alive kicks off this 1981 album on which Cale is backed by Sturgis Nikides, Jim Goodwin, Peter Muny & Robert Medici.

A live version with a significantly different texture appears on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Comes-Alive\/dp\/B001IJZ188\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Comes Alive<\/a>.\n\nFighter Pilot is another frenzied track where the Bomberettes provide frisky background vocals whilst Cale's voice & viola rule on the multi-layered Wilson Joliet. Eerie & 'gothic,' Streets of Laredo is a slow brooding piece with strange percussive sound effects that wouldn't seem out-of-place in the works of Edgar Varese. Equally downtempo, Strange Times in Casablanca has a psychedelic air and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/surrealistic\/dp\/B000008DXD\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">surrealistic<\/a>&nbsp;lyrics.\n\nThe highly experimental title track is a strange atonal affair dominated by the French chant of \"honi soit qui mal y pense,\" stabs of high-pitched backing vocals and the weird wailing of dissonant synths & guitars.

There's no mistaking this for a country or bluegrass tune, however.  Perhaps that's because of an underlying percussive beat that lends the song a distinctly rockin' energy.  Whatever it is, this unexpected sound is enough to capture a listener's interest.  Clearly Dispatch isn't a band that's afraid to think outside the box.\n\nThe lyrics speak enigmatically of the American immigrant experience: disillusionment, hardship, homesickness, and the struggle to belong.

{"text":"Lady Antebellum's latest CD is full of great music all performed wonderfully by this very special trio of artists. Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood--what a fine group of singer\/songwriters! The set of songs flows along well and they never sounded better, either! Indeed, this music leaves nothing to be desired--this is all THAT good. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and I like that artwork as well.\n\n\"Need You Now\" is a passionate ballad with a beautiful musical arrangement and Hillary Scott's singing in particular is sublime. Her voice is like a finely tuned instrument able to convey all the subtle nuances of every line she sings. \"Our Kind Of Love\" shines brighter than silver and gold when Lady Antebellum does this one up right! \"Our Kind Of Love\" also features great guitar work and the music fits in perfectly with the lyrics. \"American Honey\" has quite a melody; and the poignant \"Hello World\" gets the royal treatment from Lady A! I really like that piano arrangement on \"Hello World,\" too.\n\n\"Perfect Day\" is wonderful with that country\/softer rock\/pop flavor; this is a terrific song that only Lady Antebellum could release! They really show off their skills on \"Perfect Day.\" \"Love This Pain\" is somewhat boisterous while still being open about real, true emotions; they harmonize and play this to perfection--and beyond! I love it. \"When You Got A Good Thing\" is equally well done; and the drums along with the rest of the musical arrangement work wonders for this ballad.\n\n\"Stars Tonight\" has a fine beat that mixes country with a side dish of rock that enhances this number and makes it a very memorable number on this album. \"If I Knew Then\" has a brilliant piano arrangement; it's beautifully written and performed with true sensitivity. \"Something `Bout A Woman\" is yet another awesome country tune by Lady Antebellum; and it has a great beat. Those guitars sound so good! The CD also ends strong with Lady Antebellum performing \"Ready To Love Again.\" It leaves me wanting more!\n\nLady Antebellum has clearly produced a sophomore album that stuns me with its natural beauty; this is one group I won't be forgetting anytime soon! Their music is so beautiful. I highly recommend this for their fans; and people who enjoy country music mixed with touches of pop and rock will not be disappointed.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I'm glad I got this cd. Damn this cd is a classic.  17 songs and they all sound different and good and are in depth with lyrics and beats that sound creative.  I'm not going to give a song by song.  Instead, I'll say Kweli's lyrics have been pretty good to me always but his delivery, hooks, voice, and beat selection bothered me too much to pick up most of his cd's, even though i did hear them. This cd is different than his last efforts.  This one, is his best or at least next to the last Reflection Eternal.  This cd is not commercial. Talking about oil spills, revolution, naming names of unknown or unpopular revolutionaries, and intricate storytelling, rhyme schemes used and this vocabulary is not commercial. I wish commercial artists did sound this good. Commercial artists I thought were about rapping songs where noone could be offended and only saying what is popular to say in society today or rappers scared to make a statement against the status quo and writing lyrics with no depth of thought to fully expand on a point beyond just an analogy or simile, cliche or quote.  I thought commercial was to not challenge the listener.  This album is great and if his name wasn't Talib it would probably go platinum like Lupe's next cd will.  No knock at all on Lupe, I'm just saying when you've been in the game this long and people think they know who you are and your sound (like Talib), and then your sound sounds rejuvenated, people like me can slip up and miss it cause we wrote you off and categorized you as that dude who has nice lyrics whose subject matter repeats itself, flow is weak, and has that nasal voice and is old.  It's rare as rare can get to hear an old rapper with as many cd's as he has come back this strong with this many different styles.  It's like Hi-Tek breathed all the ingredients he'd been missing into em'.  I didn't expect it.  Straight up to Kweli, put all your money on promoting this cd.  Don't think about the future. I wouldn't wait to promote the next one cause I've heard his stuff and unless he sticks with Hi-Tek I don't know if he'll ever do a cd better than this one. So bottom line if you've been like me who likes two or 3 songs off each of his past 6 cd's but no more, then just know that this cd is different and artistic and I liked all of it.  I can't say if you'll like it or not.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Just Across the River is Jimmy Webb's \"Duets\" album, except it's not posthumous (thank goodness), and the guest singers actually sang in the same studio during the same recording sessions as Mr. Webb.  The guests are a very impressive bunch, including (in my personal \"wow factor\" order) Jackson Browne, Billy Joel, Glen Campbell,  JD Souther, Lucinda Williams, and other well regarded singers.  Mr. Campbell built a whole career singing Webb's songs, so it's particularly good to hear the two sharing \"By The Time I get To Phoenix\".  There's a nice song selection from across the great songwriter's career, although Jimmy's written so many top tunes, it's easy to list some left-off favorites.  What's there is still highly satisfying, though; plus we get one new song, the very beautiful \"Where Words End,\" sung with Michael McDonald.  With only the one new item, I can understand the frustration some fans have with this album being yet another re-do of Webb's songbook.  Beginning with the Ten Easy Pieces CD, he's dug back into his bag of tricks several times now.  But I have two responses to that notion.  First, if anybody ever deserves to rest on his laurels, it's one of the very best American songwriters we've known.  Second, these songs and the new versions are grand enough that I'm just thankful to hear them, even though I've heard the melodies many times before.","classification":4,"fold":7}

When Willie plays guitar, he doesn't stab and slash at it carelessly as he does in live performance. Also, he sings the songs fairly straight, eschewing the oddly phrased pauses and deviations that can be quite wonderful or sometimes not so wonderful. The main problem with the album is that Willie's voice is going. Five years ago, his singing was still great. Here, it gets weak at points you want it to be strong. He's had a great run. The voice had to suffer at some point in his natural aging process. And we've arrived at that point. He waited too long to record these tunes. If you could bring back Willie's voice from 10 or 15 years ago, this would be a 4 star affair. Still, it's not that bad. But for me it isn't worth a second listen. Preview before purchase is my recommendation.","classification":3,"fold":7}

Many compilations are available but most of them seem to miss something important. Not this one - all of Patsy's classic songs can be found here.\n\nCrazy was a top ten pop hit in America and (in 1990) a top twenty hit in Britain. Heartaches was Patsy's first American top forty pop hit. Don Gibson wrote Sweet dreams and had a big country hit with it, but once Patsy recorded it, it became much more popular and will be forever thought of as a Patsy Cline song. She's got you was an American top twenty pop hit and was also Patsy's first British hit, albeit only a minor one I fall to pieces was yet another top twenty pop hit in America. Walking after midnight is the song that began it all for Patsy in the fifties. Poor man's roses, Back in baby's arms and Leaving on your mind are other Patsy classics included here. Faded love, a cover of a Bob Wills song that, like Sweet dreams, is regarded as a Patsy Cline classic despite being a cover.\n\nAlso here are Patsy's fine interpretations of Lovesick blues, Half as much (Hank Williams), True Love (Bing Crosby), San Antonio rose (Bob Wills), Always (written by Irving Berlin) and many other fine songs.\n\nIf you just want one CD of Patsy's music, make it this one.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"October 2016: Re-Released on Concord Records (who this week released Melissa Etheridge's ode to STAX Records as a Stax release), The Traveling Wilburys Volumes 1 and 3 have finally gotten a remaster well deserved (for those of you who might be too young or too clueless, there was never a Volume 2, it was a joke to release 1 and then 3).  This review is for both volumes and posted to each in hopes that the buyer of one will want the other consequently.\n\nFour of the greatest recording artists ever had, over a period of evolving years, developed fast friendships and recording assists with each other.  George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Bob Dylan, and Tom Petty were, in 1988, the elite cream of the music industry.  All of them had worked with each other in a couple degrees of separation that brought them together when George was needing to record a B-Side single (which ended up being the leadoff single for the Wilburys (Handle With Care).  Orbison was in the Studio with Lynne (recording his Mystery Girl album) and George asked them both to join him, then they dropped in on Dylan to use his studio, and George stopped by Tom's to pick up one of his guitars.  Accidents happen and sometimes they are happy ones and sometimes they are astonishing epic moments.  I do not believe there has been a more monumental \"super group\" than this one, ever.  For the next couple years, Wilburys or solo records from these artists will include cameos or even full album assists between the members.  Unfortunately for history, the Great Roy Orbison died only a month after Volume I was released.  It would be a sad couple of years before the party reconvened for Volume 3, and though not as tight as the first effort, it is well worth a place on your music shelf.\n\nThe rest is history, the remaining four continued to make appearances in each other's works but despite hopeful rumors, another Wilbury album never appeared, even after Jeff Lynne became a \"5th Beatle\" during the '95 sessions to produce The Beatles Anthology series.  Wilbury albums (vinyl and CDs) went out of print after the initial runs so if you had a vinyl that got worn, it would be 2007 before you could buy a single disc CD containing both albums (thank you Rhino as usual).  Cut to 2016 and now both original records have been re-released on CD with some bonus tracks, new liner notes, and nice remastering.\n\nThe Traveling Wilburys as a group title was a fun joke for all five, wherein they assumed new \"identities\" in a very corny but whimsical manner, but the tracks they recorded are awesome collaborations, sometimes multivocal leads, sometimes single with harmonies from the others.  On both albums the songs are catchy, relatable, and none of them have aged badly.  You get a real sense of the blending of Beatles, ELO, Dylan, Heartbreakers, and of course the incomparable Orbison; it is a magic made in Heaven for classic rock fans.  Since all five members had guitars and keyboards talent between them a shout out has to go to Jim Keltner and Ray Cooper for providing percussion extraordinaire, and who supplied the bottom is a deep mystery but probably the multi-talented Lynne.  If two Wilbury volumes doesn't fill your cup, the only other way to add more than a few drops is to scrape around for Cloud Nine (Harrison), Oh Mercy (Dylan), Full Moon Fever (Petty), Mystery Girl (Orbison), and Armchair Theatre (Lynne), where you will find some or more than some collaborations betwixt the mates (except on Oh Mercy which simply benefits from Wilbury inspiration).\n\nNoteworthy: (Volume 1) Handle With Care (George and Wilburys), Rattled (Jeff and Wilburys), Not Alone Anymore (Roy and Wilburys), Margarita (Wilburys), Tweeter & The Monkey Man (Bob and Wilburys), End Of The Line (Wilburys); (Volume 3) Cool Dry Place (Tom and Wilburys), Wilbury Twist (Wilburys).  Volume 3 is heavily dominated by Petty and Lynne, by which if you are a fan of Full Moon Fever and Great Wide Open, here's your chance to binge some more.  Volume 1 is decidedly more even by critical and fan standards, and has the best representation of the super group unit, but V3 should never be left out in the cold as it is a worthy brother and companion and needs your warm affection.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"If you grew amidst the 1960s folk revival, you may well remember a favorite Pete Seeger, Burl Ives or Johnny Cash record of great American folk songs. You might have been schooled by the Dillards (in the guise of the Darling Family) on The Andy Griffith Show, had parents who sang these songs as you drifted off to sleep, sang folk songs at camp or had a progressive grade school teacher who introduced these songs at music time. But it's probably been a few decades since folk songs were central to your life. Of course, you'll still hear many of these titles on Prairie Home Companion and at bluegrass festivals, but their mainstream circulation has dwindled, pushing their legacies to the fringe. And that's a shame, because these are great songs, rife with historical significance (both in their creation and in the stories they tell) and deep musical pleasures.\n\nSuzy Bogguss has collected seventeen titles, mostly well-known, and assembled them into a songbook of both musical and intellectual depth. In addition to her lovely acoustic renderings, assisted by a terrific band of musicians and backing vocalists, she's written a companion book that provides history and sheet music. The song backgrounds essay the unsettled origins of many songs (is \"Red River Valley\" a reference to a tributary of the Mississippi, a spur of the Hudson, or the valley drained by the Red River of the North?), the variations of their lyrics, and their paths to prominence. The sheet music is perfect for accompanying your home sing-along on piano or guitar, and the CD is sure to be a favorite for both parents and kids, not to mention a nutritious respite from calorie-free children's records.

You can tell Dave Mustaine made it a goal to go and make a \"metal\" record and refused anything else. Which is what Megadeth should exactly be. The guitar work on this album is great, goes back to the fast paced thrash that I've loved from the band for years. At some points the drums and can be pretty pounding as well. However, my only complaint is the vocals from Dave. Sometimes they just fall flat and aren't excited properly. Other times the lyrics are just rather odd and don't make any sense. That complaint makes me realize and everyone else I'm sure, that this really is a band that is getting old and their prime has long passed them. I doubt we will hear another \"Rust In Peace\" ever again. If you a hardcore Megadeth fan, you will most likely really enjoy this record. However, if you are a fan that just likes the classics, don't expected to be blown away on this one.","classification":4,"fold":7}

Not to call him a male version of Jill Scott or anything like that; there are plenty of albums that sound like this, but Javier's pleasing charm, romantic sentiment, and minimal attempts to be hip-hoppish certainly make him and this album worth checking out.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"This recording by The Judds of Love Can Build A Bridge has wonderful sound to it and The Judds sang it from their hearts, their voices sing with such passion!\n\nFor me personally, this is a very special song that has so much truth to it. I downloaded the words to this song from AZLyrics.com before I purchased this song from Amazon and so glad that I had all of the lyrics. Then my volunteer group went to a Senior Center and sang this song to the participants. And since there are so many kinds of love and because love is so important, this song says it all::\n\nThe song speaks of whispering love yet so loudly so that every heart will understand that love and only love joins man. And it goes on to say when we stand together, it is our finest hour--we can do anything we set our minds to do because it is love that gives us power.\n\nThis song is so inspiring to me and gives me hope and joy when I listen to it. And it keeps me so reminded that love is really all that matters at the end of the day.\n\nHighly recommend this song!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I bought this album off the strength of \"All About That Bass\" (one of the best arranged pop songs I've heard in a long time) and \"Lips Are Movin',\" a delightfully clever little ditty.  Most of the album follows suit: modern pop & hip\/hop mixed with 60s doo-wop, some light (very light) rap, and a little reggae.  Sort of a bubblegum Amy Winehouse, if you will, with far stronger vocals.\n\nThat's actually the two strengths of this album: the melodies (utterly infectious) and Trainor's vocals.  She's a powerhouse singer who's keeping it restrained, going more for nuance.  It works, and thank God, because most of her lyrics are rather trite.  Face it: do we really need more \"you go, girl, be who you want\" songs?  Well, okay, we probably do.  And Trainor does it with the best of them; she's got a sense of humor about it, and absolutely no shame.\n\nThe latter is where the album actually falters.  Girl power is one thing; self-image is one thing.  But singing about how you're beautiful the way you are, and then being proud strutting the walk of shame?  Sort of a mixed signal.  Don't get me wrong: I'm no prude.  But Trainer seems to bounce back and forth; the album would be more solid if she stuck with one and ran with it.  And ditched \"Bang Them Sticks,\" which is just atrocious.  And let's not forget: this is an album that OPENS with an interlude, closes with a song called \"Credit\" (the Deluxe version at least), and is entitled TITLE, which is arguably not as bad as calling your record UNTITLED, but it's close.  (Seriously, kids, look it up.  Stuff's been done to death.)  I've also got a thing about songs that reference texting (yeah, I do it, but it's so unpoetic), and anytime a tune uses the word \"boobies.\"  As a rhyme, no less.\n\nI almost wish I'd gotten the regular version; a little goes a long way.  That said, TITLE (groan) is a very solid, very delightful album.  I listened to it after a stressful day, and I can barely remember what was so worrisome.  It's full of catchy hooks and infectious melodies, performed by a very good vocalist.  Bubblegum pop it may be at heart, and a morally ambiguous heart at that, but it'll still put a smile on your face and a tap in your toes.  If you want music  with some depth, you know where to go (I hope).  If you want music that's fun, this is where you should be.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"They have been wowing audiences now for nearly six decades. The group was formed in Brooklyn, NY in 1957 and was originally known as The Chesters. Just a year or so later they changed their name to The Imperials and ultimately to Little Anthony and the Imperials. Led by lead singer Anthony Gourdine the group would make some of the most memorable R&B singles of the early 1960s.\n\n\"Hurt So Bad\" is a song written by Teddy Randazzo, Bobby Weinstein, and Bobby Hart. The song was written specifically for Little Anthony. Over the decades it has been recorded by dozens of artists including Linda Ronstadt, The Lettermen and Jackie DeShannon. Most would agree that the definitive version of this tune was recorded by Little Anthony and The Imperials. Released in January 1965 \"Hurt So Bad\" would become a Top Ten hit. The song was performed by the group on their first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. I think we can all relate when Little Anthony cries out Like needles and pins people say \"you've been making out okay. She's in love don't stand in her way\"  There is pain oozing from every syllable in Anthonys mesmerizing vocal performance. One of the best soul records of the 1960's.","classification":5,"fold":7}

I think instead of releasing this 18 track disc, it would have been a better idea to include all the masters over 2 discs on 36 tracks.

{"text":"Album: 4 stars: Live set: 5 stars\n\nTwenty One Pilots, the Columbus, OH-based duo consisting of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun, released this, their debut album, in early 2013. I had listened to it before and it didn't really resonate all that much with me. Then I saw these guys in concert recently (more on that later), and I simply had to give this another listen.\n\n\"Vessel\" starts off with several can't miss tracks, each of which could be a radio single, if commercial radio were still any good, which of course it isn't. The surging \"Odd to Sleep\" sounds like it could be Ben Folds from 15 years ago. \"Holding On To You\" sounds musically like it came straight from Phoenix, but then Twenty One Pilots adds some rapping. \"Migraine\" is an all-out rap song, but one that actually is fun to listen to. \"House of Gold\" is a lighter tune, with some folksy influences. If there is a theme developing, it is that Twenty One Pilots is the curious mix of piano\/keyboard-driven pop with a healthy doses of rap. I am not a fan of rap, generally speaking, reasons why I probably didn't give this album a fair chance when I first listened to it. Upon reflection, I am more impressed by the melodies, and the smart pop hooks that appear throughout. In all, I am very happy I gave this album another spin.\n\nAs to that live set, I saw these guys last weekend at the Bunbury music festival here in Cincinnati, where they played a late afternoon set on the main stage, and they KILLED. Starting their set with \"Ode to Sleep\" (and playing most of the tracks rom \"Vessel\"), the duo played a 60 min. set with a level of energy and excitement that I hadn't seen in a long time, and was simply infectious for the crowd, which ate it up. In turn Jospeh and Dun fed off of the huge response from the crowd, and it became one of those very special live sets where it feels something big is happening. As mentioned, I didn't care much for the album before this, but I was so impressed (and entertained) by their set that I just had to give it another shot. From looking at the comments on the festival's facebook wall, it seems that TONS of people thought this was the best set of the entire festival. If you have a chance to see these guys live, DO NOT MISS THEM!","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"This album reminds me of a couple of extremely talented guys back from the beginning of two genres we were introduced to in the late 80's, one of which Freeman defined.  Of course I'm talking about Checkfield, who were college professors, performers, composers, producers. While they were tenured professors and daring composers with an eclectic, cerebral, orchestral new-age vision, Freeman was a young studio guitar slinger\/composer\/producer who was the tip of the spear for the \"smooth jazz\" artists who are a staple we all know of today. This album goes from the prior compositional formula we are used to (integrating jazz, funk, rock, ballads) using synths, bass, percussion, guitar, sax\/EWI, to now using the entire pallet of orchestral instruments.\nTo not give Freeman credit for going out on this limb is an insult. He is a musical genius and continues to progress.  He has more talent and creativity in his pinky than 90% of the musicians on the scene today.\nThank you Russ.\n\nHaving listened to this CD in relation to Freeman's previous works, and reading his thoughts on the album, this is how he has written all along. The common themes within several songs are how he fleshes out ideas to then combine into epic 5+ minute works of art. So this is more like, welcome to my studio, this how I work, and have worked since the mid 1980's.\nFreeman follows the trend set by Pete Townsend on Quadrophenia; he creates an entire piece of work (through common themes) by himself, then backs out all but his guitars. However, what we see here is more of a \"work in progress\" composition.  He could \"finish\" these songs with his traditional style and probably will for live shows.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Mastodon have long ago established themselves as one of the most prominent, promising, and all-around preeminent heavy music groups of the Twenty-first century. And on their sixth album proper, they continue driving this point home. True, 2014's \"Once More `Round The Sun,\" might be similar to all releases put out with this Atlanta, Georgia quartet's name on it because it is an epic yet cohesive mix that shuffles back and forth between crushing doom metal and ethereal progressive rock psychedelia. Even so, the results remain as unpredictable as ever, as each song, through the use of their numerous tempo shifts and arrangement  change-ups, seamlessly transitions through several different places.\n\nAnd plus, \"Once More...\" is no stranger to curveballs. Take track six, \"Asleep In The Deep,\" for but one example. It augments a steady, humming bass groove and jazzy drum beat with jangly acoustic guitars, and some dreary, clean singing. Then, add some freaky, robotic-tinged vocal effects, trippy synth lines (courtesy of The Mars Volta's Ikey Owens), and mazy melodic soloing to the mix, and the end result is a very subdued and melodic venture, and an epic and infectious album centerpiece. And \"Aunt Lisa\" is also heavily experimental, even for Mastodon. It brings back those robotic-sounding spoken word vocals, utilizes them to excellent (and exceedingly memorable) effect, and also drops in some uncharacteristically shrill and high pitched screaming\/shrieking for added dissonance. And in an even more unpredictable move, a female-chanted vocal refrain is also included near the end of \"Aunt Lisa,\" thus sounding not unlike a high school cheerleader team.\n\nBut with that said, it is actually a cut like the two set openers, \"Tread Lightly\" and \"The Moherload\" that are a better representation of the record, as a whole. After opening with a tricky, proggy acoustic bit, the former song rapidly slams into pure doom metal heaviness, with a massive, commanding main electric guitar riff and energetic, dexterous drumming. And the latter song kick starts with a deft, pounding introductory drum solo before segueing into more crunchy territory, with adherently groovy guitar and bass riffs. And this number is also highlighted by a catchy, melodic, sing-songy vocal refrain, and some neat little harmonic guitar soloing, too.\n\nElsewhere, the thunderous \"High Road\" is a muscularly, memorably-riffed number where adherent, propulsive guitar grooves routinely (and very smoothly) flow into memorable choruses; and the title track works similarly, as it finds a head-rattling guitar\/bass groove and pounding, dramatic-sounding drum fills being offset by sunny melodic choruses and soaring guitar harmonies. But \"Chimes At Midnight\" is an even greater standout, on account of it being quite possibly the album's heaviest song, and one that is adorned by propulsive, chainsaw riffing, lumbering doom metal grooves, and some deft drumming (including a sparse but still noteworthy bit of double bass heft.) With that said, though, \"Feast Your Eyes\" gives it a fair shake of competition, as it burns straight ahead with a lean, mean, frills-free groove and heavy, grumbling bass line.\n\n\"Ember City,\" with its locomotive doom-tinged thrash riffage and steady bass work, is another one of the set's more unforgettable pieces. But of course, this fact could be due in large part to it being highlighted by a solo section where the guitarists take turns ripping out one memorable and wailing solo after another. And working your way through the rest of the songs, \"Halloween\" is another heavily groove-centric mosher with memorable riffs laced throughout its mix of wah-tinged leads and soaring, ripping solo flights. And finally, \"Diamond In The Witch House\" is another significant standout track, and not just because it has guest vocals from Neurosis mouthpiece Scott Kelly. It begins with a trippy progressive metal intro before locking into a hooky, engaging, staccato guitar-driven groove. And this song, a nearly seven-minute long epic, also features some really great, inventive, expansive drumming and ominous guitar riffs to go along with its really anguished-sounding vocals, thus helping to ensure that it remains firmly and permanently lodged into the listener's frontal lobe after just one listen.\n\n\"Once More `Round The Sun\" might not trump previous Mastodon records (2004's \"Leviathan\" remains their career-defining body of music to  this very day), but it does certainly come very close. And if a rating of five-stars does not imply to you that this is anything but another strong progressive doom metal opus, then the point has clearly been missed. It is an excellent album, and one that offers re-assuring proof to the fact that Mastodon are the best thing related to heavy metal ever to come out of the great state of Georgia.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that no true Mary J. Blige fan expected Blige to return with an album that was as classic as 2005's brilliant THE BREAKTHROUGH. Blige even commented that she wasn't concerned about outdoing the success of that milestone in her career. While the exceptional GROWING PAINS doesn't trump THE BREAKTHROUGH, it is another solid album in MJB's career.  With that said, Blige does experiment more on GROWING PAINS that she has on previous albums which gives all fans a taste of what the future may hold for Blige. It is a well balanced mixed of adult contemporary styled R&B, hip-hop, and urban contemporary music.\n\nThe album starts off on the right foot with \"Work That\", which is honestly the best of the two singles released from GROWING PAINS as of yet.  The production isn't far removed from NO MORE DRAMA's \"Family Affair\" and proves to be a welcome addition to Mary's collection.  \"Grown Woman\" is one of the big surprises of GROWING PAINS in which Blige channels her hip-hop soul roots for a banger that will surely crossover to R&B purists as well as hip-hop savvy listeners.  Ludacris's guest verse is sound here, but Mary J. Blige makes sure that all eyes are on her as she shed's through this albums \"Enough Cryin'\".  The difference? Harder drums and a more spunky vocal performance from MJB.\n\n\"Just Fine\" follows and keeps the momentum moving forward.  When I first heard this track, I was actually a bit disappointed.  It took time for it to grow on me and when it did, it was hott!!! Again, \"Work That\" is still the best.  \"Feel Like a Woman\", \"Stay Down\", and \"Hurt Now\"  are all strong.  \"Shakedown\" features Usher and while it isn't Usher's best collaboration (that would be \"Same Girl\"), it is enjoyable.  \"Til Morning\" is this albums \"Gonna Breakthrough\" or \"You Can't Hide From Luv\"  - it's nearly perfect.  \"Roses\" and \"Fade Away\" are solid, but not as exciting as the earlier tracks or the phenomenal \"What Love Is\", \"Work in Progress (Growing Pains)\", or neo-soul inflected \"Talk To Me\" with its six feel groove.  \"If You Love Me\", \"Smoke\", and \"Come To Me (Peace)\" are solid, though they aren't the best of the best of GROWING PAINS. Notably, \"Come To Me\" does features innovative production work combining the best of the adult-alternative pop with R&B\/Hip-hop synths.\n\nAll quibbles aside, GROWING PAINS is destined to be another critical and commercial hit for MJB.  It may not match THE BREAKTHROUGH, but who cares.  Mary has been representing since circa 1990 and each and every album has been incredibly consistent - she can sing her butt off! Even LOVE & LIFE, weaker than her other efforts, was a shining moment because MJB can make bad material sound better than what it is and that is a gift. 4 stars Mary - Keep working that!!!","classification":4,"fold":7}

Skip forward 5 years and I see how time has not only eased me into Newman's music but has made me an admirer. I have since realized that Newman stands among the great social satirists - and that's everybody, not just the singer-songwriters. Whether it's pollution\/industrialization (Burn On), Religion (He Gives us All his love, God's Song), Death (Old Man), Fame (Lonely at the Top), Reminiscing (Dayton Ohio 1903, Last Night I had a Dream ), Perversion\/Lust (Leave Your Hat on), American Ignorance\/Racism (Sail Away) - Randy's craft is undeniably poinant, honest, and meticulous in it's disection of the human heart and our social practices.","classification":5,"fold":7}

It may be technically \"grunge\", but to me it's just damn good music.  Cobain was one of the few Gen Xers who was a real artist.  This album has many great songs, including Smells like Teen Spirit, Lithium, Come as You Are, and Breed (which is underrated in my opinion).  In Utero is Nirvana's (and Kurt's) masterpiece, but this is still good.  Those trashing Cobain are mistaken, but those who act like this album is the Gen X equivalent of Sgt. Pepper are sadly mistaken.  So, chill out on this thread, and realise that Kurt was a great artist and musician and should be respected, but he isn't akin to God (and he would probably have said that himself)...","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I quote the first line from \"Between the Two\", the fourteenth track off the Bangles' latest album Doll Revolution, because I'm wondering if this is going to be their last album. It's been 15 years since they recorded an album together, and when I looked at the liner notes -- actually, there really aren't any, which makes you wonder if they just rushed into the studio to put this album out. Also, this album is on Koch Records, and Koch seems to be the place where everyone eventually ends up -- well, either there or TVT.\nAll the other three-star reviews for this album are pretty accurate, and each person seems to have a different opinion of which song(s) stands out. To me, the best song on here is the song they have out now, \"Something That You Said\" (its video also appears on the bonus DVD). And \"Mixed Messages\" is pretty catchy despite the lyrical shortcomings. But the rest of the songs aren't that great.\nA lot of these songs really could have been written better. At times the lyrics go from lazy (\"Ride the Ride\", \"Ask Me No Questions\") to crazy (Elvis Costello's \"Tear Off Your Own Head\"). \"Grateful\" is tolerable, but it's the kind of song you'd expect to hear from them when they were still in their teens, not in their forties. And sorry, but the ballad \"I Will Take Care of You\" sounds like a watered-down version of \"Eternal Flame\".\nPeople say a lot of the songs on here sound better live than they do on the album, and if that's the case, then you should just see them in concert. Or else if you're still feeling nostalgic about the Bangles, then just pull out their `80s albums or their Greatest Hits package. The ladies can still play and sing, but I wouldn't really call Doll Revolution a revolutionary album.\nAnthony Rupert","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"Maryland, let alone its Gaithersburg township, may not be a natural breeding ground for rap talent, but 2013 XXL Freshman, Logic, may soon be putting his locale on the map. The rapper and part time producer, who has been buzzing since his mixtape cascade began in 2010, seems to have his mind in the right place for Under Pressure, his studio debut. Executive produced by No ID and released by Def Jam and Visionary Music Group, Under Pressure boasts busy, luscious beats and a matured Logic confronting his rough past with a bright outlook on life. Logic starts the album with this positive tone and then delves into family stories and gets ambitious in the \"Soul Food\" two-parter. He covers a variety of topics throughout (girls, crime, movies, crew love, karma, etc.), but the most prominent and reoccurring of them include Logic's transition from a troubled, aimless childhood to mind- blowing music stardom and how it affects him and his family. Under Pressure's production as a whole captures several emotions and vibes, and it definitely has No ID's ambient beat making influence. A diverse array of producers including Visionary's 6ix and Logic himself supply rich electronic instruments and quick repeating hoots on more than one song. Logic proves himself a flavorful emcee, rapping at different speeds and cadences with a varying rhyme structure and awesome energy. He demonstrates multiple dimensions of creativity on tracks like \"Nikki,\" about a specific type of chemical dependency, and the title track \"Under Pressure,\" where he raps in the first person as his sister then father. The regular version of the album contains no guests but features Childish Gambino and Big Sean on two deluxe version bonus cuts. In the 12th track, \"Till The End,\" Logic recaps his rocky experiences in the music business and life in general but stays committed to keeping an optimistic attitude going forward. It is a fitting close to the album, where Logic shares his feelings and conveys again his project's chief mood. Firm, impactful and fun, Under Pressure shows a lot of promise for its author, who has a great mindset overall.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"Revised review. I originally gave this album 3.5 stars, but upon further  listening, I'd bump it up to four stars. The album has grown on me and took a few listens to fully appreciate. I still think it may be a tad overly long, but it's still superb.\n\nChris Cornell, one of rock's greatest singers from the past 25 years, has had a hit-or-miss solo career. While he has released a number of classic albums with Soundgarden, and a few very good ones with Audioslave, his solo work is a little spotty. His debut, 'Euphoria Morning' (later released as 'Euphoria Mourning') (1999), was fantastic. More laid back and relaxed than his work with Soundgarden (or later Audioslave), it was clear that Cornell's solo work was going to sound a lot different than what his fans were used to. Going back to the haunting \"Seasons\" from the 'Singles' soundtrack, Chris' solo music generally avoids hard-rock terrain, going for a stripped down, mellower sound, with maybe slightly more reflective lyrics.  'Euphoria Morning\/Mourning' is probably the most overlooked album in Chris' long, impressive resume and the best of his four solo albums.\n\nAfter three albums with Audioslave, the supergroup made up of RATM alumni, came Chris' second album \"Carry On\" (2007). The album boasted one great song, \"You Know My Name,\" from the James Bond film \"Casino  Royale.\" Other than that one terrific song, 'Carry On' was rather forgettable. It's not that the album was horrible, it's just that it was a rather bland, pedestrian affair. Two years later Cornell returned with the Timbaland produced \"Scream,\" maybe the most critically lambasted album since \"Van Halen 3.\" While I personally like \"Scream\" and find it to be a bizarre, interesting album, I hope he never makes another one like it again.  After returning to Soundgarden and hard-rock with the excellent \"King Animal\" (2012), Chris is back for his fourth solo album, the Brendan O'Brian produced \"Higher Truth.\"\n\n\"Higher Truth\" sounds like a cross between the laid-back but intense \"Seasons\" and  'Euphoria Morning\/Mourning.' \"Nearly Forgot my Broken Heart\" is easily the best, most memorable song on the album. The rest of the album is a collection of relaxed, melon collie, tightly written confessionals about interpersonal relationships . \"Higher Truth\" shows a middle-aged, contemplative  Chris Cornell, at ease. The album reminds me a little bit of Paul McCartney's self-titled debut (1970). Both albums are organic, with its creator playing everything or most everything himself (O'Brian and others did contribute to this album) with neither artist overthinking anything. While the album starts to sound a little monotonous about two-thirds through, and maybe the four bonus songs should have been left off for a leaner album, it is never-the-less a relaxed, enjoyable album that would be appreciated most on a lazy Sunday morning or while taking a walk on a sunny Fall day. While \"Higher Truth\" isn't the best album Chris ever released, it should be of interest to his fans, especially those who enjoy his quieter side.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Unclassified is Robert Randolph's second album, but his first studio effort. His first album, Live At Wetlands, showed that Mr. Randolph plays one mean steel guitar. The question would be if that same sweat and fire could be recreated in the studio. The answer is a resounding yes. Mr. Randolph cut his teeth playing in a Pentecostal church in his hometown of Orange, New Jersey and the album has clear gospel roots. But the band is really more of a funk and roll band in the Parliament-Funkadelic mold. Mr. Randolph's steel guitar is often counterbalanced by popping bass lines and wailing organs. \"So Refreshing\" has a funky bass and buzz saw steel riff and \"Squeeze\" has fiery organs that perfectly contrast the wicked steel guitar. \"I Need More Love\" has a call and response chorus that sits atop a hard funk groove that is very Stevie Wonder like. \"Smile\" slows things down and features tender harmonies. \"Calypso\" has a Latin-jazz-rock Santana vibe and \"Run For Your Life\" closes out the disk on a full-out Jersey bar sound. Robert Randolph is one of the most gifted guitarists to come around in a long time and his music demands your attention.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"UPDATE: 10.18.15 A few months later and back from their show - I'm pretty excited to see what the future holds for this group.  I still stand by my original opinion below, but I have grown to really, more deeply, like the majority of the tracks. It is heavily in my rotation.  Now, F Me Up has always been my least favorite song on the album, but live -- live - it is quite good.  If you have the opportunity to see them, don't miss out.\n\nLydia. I had to add this song to my library and was consumed with the style. Lydia just isn't a good song from this band - it transcends genres and I highly suspect it will be used, in part, in television and film.  The chorus is spot-on and the build-ups are just catchy and insane.\n\nLydia, Lost, Bath Salts and 23 round out my favorites.  F$uk Me Up and Claudeland are my bottom tracks as they are both too much like Punk (the latter going Blues).\n\nOverall - I'm quite happy with this purchase and I look forward to seeing what Highly Suspect can do.

{"text":"Bruno Mars first caught the attention of most when he appeared on B.o. B's hit \"Nothin' on you\" followed by Travie McCoy's \"Billionaire\", not to mention he co-penned Flo-Rida's \"Right Round\" and co-produced K'Naan's \"Wavin' Flag\". Now comes his debut album and he runs through a variety of styles from Reggae (the lilting \"Our First Time\", \"The Lazy Song\", the deep dub \"Liquor Store Blues\" with Damian Marley), Rock (\"Runaway Baby\"), to Pop and Funk on everything else.\n\nThe tender \"Grenade\" (with soothing harmonies) finds him declaring \"I'd catch a grenade for you \/ Throw my hand on a blade for you \/ I'd jump in front of train for you\/You know I'd do anything for you\", all for a girl who won't do the same for him. \"Just The Way You Are\" is set to skittery martial beats, \"Marry You\" is sixties-style Pop (with rather cheesy lyrics), \"Talking To The Moon\" an expansive ballad on which he gets to really flex his impressive vocals (reminiscent at times of Michael Jackson), and the Folky \"Count On Me\" sounds very Jack Johnson.\n\nLast but definitely not least is the ultra catchy upbeat \"The Other Side\" with a nice spoken bridge featuring B.o. B and Cee-Lo adding his soulful vocals. \"It's better if you don't understand\" goes the refrain to an enchanting wall of harmonies. I had feared this would turn out to be one of those over-rated albums, but it is definitely a winner!","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"\"Zipper Catches Skin\" may be the most unbalanced Cooper disk recorded. It has some fantastic songs like \"Tag, You're It\", a tribute to 80's slasher films in which Alice sings as if directing a B-Movie. \"Adaptable\" is a really fun song that will stay in your head after just one listen to the album. And you have \"I Like Girls\" and \"Remarkably Insincere\" which are fun songs about a womanizing loser. \"I Am the Future\" is actually a pretty dark song lyrically and I think is the standout song on the album. But, on the flip side you have what may be Cooper's worst song ever with \"No Baloney Homosapiens\". I am sure at the time, Cooper thought this was pretty clever, but musically it just does not flow, the lyrics are choppy, and forced into a rhyming scheme that just doesn't work. \"Make That Money\" is another forgettable ditty, with lyrics again not befitting Alice Cooper. But outside of those two songs Alice I think \"Zipper Catches Skin\" is a really good album, but still the weakest of the early 80's New Age Alice. I prefer \"Flush the Fashion\", \"Special Forces\" and the best of this era \"DaDa\". Still, it's Alice Cooper and worth the price for the import, if for nothing else than to own the entire Cooper Collection.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"Angels & Airwaves continues forward with their 80s-tinged blending of punk vocals, anthemic and chest-beating U2 choruses, and the guitar shadings and conceptual nature of classic Pink Floyd. All in all, some of my favorite musical touchstones that have been part of the soundtrack to my life.\n\n\"Call To Arms\" opens in classic AvA style, widescreen and epic, beautiful chiming guitars and pulsing keyboards building up into a huge song with big choruses and gorgeous Hammond organ.\n\n\"Everything's Magic\" has become sort've \"our song\" between my girlfriend and I. I heard it for the first time just days before we met, and it was played quite a bit in the car during our first few months. Everytime we hear it come on in a department store or the mall, we give eachother this look and a smile that is priceless. There's a nice pop-punk quality to it (which is different from anything on their first album), although the chorus is a pure adrenaline rush reminescent of early Asia.\n\n\"Love Like Rockets\" is another \"classic AvA\" song, with those trademark sequenced keyboards and drums. The intro is perfectly epic, utilising sound samples of President Eisenhower, astronauts, and various radio chatter and feedback that brings to mind the Space Race of the 50's and 60's. Tom seems to be making a parallel between the giddy rush of new love, and launching on a rocket into an unknown frontier.\n\n\"Breathe\" is sort've a ballad with nice soft keyboards. \"Sirens\" is fast-paced and frenetic and the chorus reminds me of The Proclaimers. \"Secret Crowds\" has a huge chorus, although I love the music and words during the verses a bit more. \"Star of Bethlehem\/True Love\" was originally recorded for a compilation CD in late 2006, and is mixed a little differently on I-Empire. Another mini-epic, with trancey sequencers and Edge-like guitar effects. \"Lifeline\" has a keyboard sound that immediately brought me fresh memories of 1985, considering that it sounded exactly like the intro to Reading Rainbow.\n\n\"Jumping Rooftops\" is a cut-and-pasted percussion and keyboard interlude that leads into \"Rite of Spring\", which is another relatively experimental song, sounding more raw and punky as Tom reflects on his teenage life. (He said that he wanted to write a song that would sound like a garage band's first tune, written in high school.) The album ends with \"Heaven\", reprising musical and lyrical themes from \"Valkyrie Missile\", the opening track on We Don't Need To Whisper, effectively ending the two-album concept and bringing things full circle.\n\nThe lyrics continue in the same vein of We Don't Need To Whisper, and are positively infectious in their optimistic spiritual outlook, topics of reformation and reinvention, living your dreams, and never giving up. This is a message that I wish more Top 40 bands would preach, and is vastly needed during the hard times we live in. Being a grounded but optimistic person myself (as well as having a love for the 80's, Sci-Fi, and prog-rock), this band is perfect blend of my favorite things.\n\nOverall, I-Empire sounds quite a bit like their last album, although has a couple of curveballs and is a little more organic sounding. New bassist Matt Wachter (formerly of 30 Seconds To Mars) and guitarist David Kennedy don't stand out too much (being buried behind layers of effects and keyboards, not to mention Tom's own playing), but drummer Atom Willard continues with greatness previously seen before, with a fiery, explosive energy, awesome fills, and a rhythmic groove that very nearly puts him in the \"virtuoso\" category. Check out his electronic\/acoustic percussion showcase throughout the first few minutes of \"Star of Bethlehem\/True Love\" (notably performed just as perfect in a live setting when I caught the band live in early 2008.)\n\nThe album artwork is a departure from the last one, instead featuring a painted montage (by Drew Struzan, famous movie poster artist of Lucas and Spielberg) of the band over a sunset horizon. Yet another reference to a positive 80's childhood.\n\nIf AvA fans can't get enough of this type of sound, I'd strongly recommend some other prog-rock bands such as Pendragon (Believe or Pure), 30 Seconds To Mars, It Bites (The Tall Ships or The Big Lad In The Windmill), Rush (Grace Under Pressure or Power Windows), dredg, Coheed & Cambria and Asia.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Keystone Companions\/The Complete 1973 Fantasy Recordings, recorded live on July 10 and 11, 1973 at the Keystone Club in Berkeley, California, beautifully captures the magical musical friendship of keyboardist Merl Saunders and guitarist Jerry Garcia.  The Fantasy Records lavish four-disc set, is scheduled for release this Tuesday (September 25th) on the heels of the 70th anniversary of Jerry Garcia's birth and includes seven previously unreleased tracks, a special booklet featuring vintage photos, liner notes by Grateful Dead expert David Gans; a poster, a coaster, button and \"scratchbook\" (replicating the design of the original album's promotional matchbooks.\n\nThe incredible band featured Saunders; Garcia, guitar and vocals; John Kahn on bass; and Bill Vitt on drums.  Virtuoso David Grisman added mandolin to the classic Bob Dylan number, Positively 4th Street. The mix of songs ranged frm Saunders originals to covers of songs by Jimmy Cliff, Junior Parker, Holland-Dozier-Holland, Rodgers & Hart, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudp, Lightnin' Hopkins, Don Nix, Dan Penn and Dylan.\n\nSan Franciso-born keyboardist Merl Sauders had been writing and performing in New York before returning to the West Coast. Producer Nick Gravenites offered him studio work that included playing with guitarist Jerry Garcia, already at the helm of one of the world's most popular rock bands, the Grateful Dead. \"Garcia reminded me of (jazz guitarist) Eric Gale,\" Saunders recollected, \"Anything he played was very musical. He knew how to do a rhythm on any kind of tune - gospel, blues, jazz.  I was amazed.\"\n\nSaunders also helped Garcia expand his harmonic knowledge and even showed him some Art Tatum runs.  \"He taught me music,\" Garcia said of Saunders.\n\nBy December, 1970, a weekly jam session featuring Saunders, Garcia, Kahn, and Vitt had become a weekly gig at San Francisco's Matrix. Of course Garcia was already a major figure in musical counterculture as lead guitarist for the Dead, so he kept this new band low-key - so much that it never really had a name (although it was referred to as The Group at times).  As Garcia said, \"I couldn't take the pressure of being a double celebrity. It's a drag just being it once.\" (That didn't stop the itinerant Garcia from having a third band as well, Old and In the Way, with David Grisman, Peter Rowan, and Vassar Clements).\n\nLive at Keystone, originally released as a double LP, was recorded by Grateful Dead associates Betty Cantor and Rex Jackson.  Additional material was released as Live At Keystone, Volumes 1 & 2 in 1988.  Keystone Companions\/The Complete 1973 Fantasy Recordings assembles the original recordings and presents them, remastered, in the order in which the songs were performed at those two shows.  The repertoire spans blues, rockabilly, jazz, funk, Broadway, Motown, two Bob Dylan suns, and Jimmy Cliff's immortal The Harder They Come. Some songs appear twice, providing the opportunity to hear how the band kept it loose and fresh.\n\nAs Gans notes, \"This music is as exciting and satisfying 40 years later as it was on the day it was made.\"  Boomerocity couldn't agree more.\n\nBoomerocity.com","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor, infamous for long delays between albums, sure has been productive lately. 2007 saw Reznor release the critically acclaimed \"Year Zero\" and its' follow-up \"Year Zero Remixed.\" In addition, last year Reznor produced Saul Williams' \"The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of Niggy Tardust.\" Now, out of nowhere, with no advance notice, Reznor is back with NIN's sixth album, the instrumental \"Ghosts I-IV.\"\n\n\"A soundtrack for daydreams,\" is how Reznor sums up the new album...and that, I feel, is the best way to appreciate the new NIN. Rather than listening to this album as background music while driving or doing housework, \"Ghosts I-IV\" is best appreciated with relaxed, yet concentrated listening. Lie in bed or on the sofa, relaxed, and immerse yourself with this CD. Just sort of daydream--meditate, think about whatever...and let \"Ghosts I-IV\" be the soundtrack...\n\nAnd as the mood of the album changes, allow your mood to flow with the album...try to get lost in the music.\n\nSome have commented that \"Ghosts I-IV\" sounds similar in style to the instrumental music from \"The Fragile,\" (1999) but I don't know if it's all that accurate to say that. While the instrumental music from \"the Fragile\" sort of held the vocal compositions from that CD together like glue, \"Ghosts I-IV\" is a little more \"out there.\" It can, therefore, be seen as a mosaic--of several different styles--piano compositions, industrial beats, the avant-garde--all mixed together, with no real dominant flavor overpowering the rest. And while the album is all-over-the-place, treading many territories, everything works; \"Ghosts I-IV\" takes so many twists-and-turns-its always interesting. At the same time, with almost two hours of music to absorb, \"Ghosts I-IV\" is best appreciated with repeated listens--to fully appreciate all its' rich textures and intricacy.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"1. Ayesha Says (Intro) - NA\/5\n\n2. Strange Fruition - 4\/5 A decent way to start out the album. The hook is kind of weird and almost feels like a gap in the middle of the song, but Lupe comes back in before it gets too unbearable. The instrumentals are decent being dominated by a violin during Lupe's parts, and the Benjamin parts are mostly just a beat with some computerized whispering.\n\n3. ITAL (Roses) - 5\/5 This was almost immediately a fan favorite. It's got a little more of an uplifting sound, while Lupe's flow matches the song well. Lupe does a little bit of a half rap, half singing chorus which again fits well.\n\n4. Around My Way (Freedom Ain't Free) - 5\/5 Lupe's lead single from the album. He uses the hip-hop classic \"They Reminice Over You (T.R.O.Y)\" by Pete Rock as the backing sample. Lupe fits the beat very well as he lays down a couple of verses that all seem to be comparable to the others. He speeds things up a little bit to do the hook, which turns out to be one of the best parts of the song.\n\n5. Audubon Ballroom - 5\/5 I smiled the first time I heard this song. It has an humbly epic feel to it. Lupe goes solo which is great to hear, especially knowing he attempted singing. His singing actually isn't bad, in fact it's one of the more memorable moments from the album, in a good way. A great song overall.\n\n6. B*tch Bad - 3\/5 B*tch bad comes out a mixed plate. He sends a good message through the song using three \"acts\". In between the acts he lays down an incredibly mediocre and ultimately lazy hook, where he chants \"B*tch bad, woman good, lady better, they misunderstood\". Lupe paints a half finished picture through the three acts, with the third hurrying to put it all together. Lupe has been known to have deep lyrics, but with how blunt he was with the lyrics this time around, it comes off as kind of bland. The song never really sucks you in, though the beat is somewhat enjoyable.\n\n7. Lamborghini Angels - 4\/5 The best way to put Lamborghini Angels is a decent love child between \"Around My Way\" and \"B*tch Bad\". The lyrics are a little more evened out compared to \"B*tch Bad\", as well as more controversial and even kind of disturbing. The beat is good, but still doesn't match up with what Lupe has done on \"Food & Liqor\" and \"The Cool\".  Overall a good song.\n\n8. Put Em Up - 5\/5 This song was absolutely refreshing. It was released a few days before the album dropped and it reminded me so much of \"The Cool\" I'm not kidding when I say it could of been a part of \"The Cool\", and all for the better. The hook, the rapping, everything reminds you of the old Lupe.\n\n9. Heart Donor - 3\/5 This is somewhat of an elevator music version of Strange Fruition with a better hook. Poo Bear does a decent job with the hook and Lupe, like always, does great. It almost seems like a filler track. Nothing outstanding here.\n\n10. How Dare You - 4\/5 How Dare You is a little bit of a disappointment knowing it was supposed to be a single before being axed by Battle Scars. It seems a lot like an original Food and Liquor song, which is actually kind of nice. The title kind of throws you off a bit since the song has a happier vibe to it.\n\n11. Battle Scars - 5\/5 Okay, this wasn't really Lupe's song in the first place, but if you want to sell albums you'll probably want some radio time. The song does a great job fitting in lyric wise with the rest of the songs, though it kind of sticks out as the most mainstream song on the album, for better or for worse. Lupe does great with his two verses and Guy Sebastian the same with his parts. A good song, just one that doesn't really fit in great with the rest of the album.\n\n12. Brave Heart - 4\/5 Another kind of filler track. The hook is done well as Poo Bear does a chanting chorus which fits the beat very well. Not bad, but ultimately forgettable.\n\n13. Form Follows Function - 5\/5 Lupe's favorite song on the album is not a disappointment. The instrumentals are excellent with the saxophone coming and going every once in a while, it just fits the song well. It may not be the \"masterpiece\" Lupe promised, but it's still a pretty good track.\n\n14. Cold War - 3\/5 Jane $$$ throws in a good hook on this one which is good because the track almost crashes and burns beyond that. Lupe surprisingly gets kind of boring, the instrumentals do absolutely nothing to suck you in.\n\n15. Unforgivable Youth - 5\/5 After my first time listening to this track I was reminded of the first time listening to \"The Instrumental\" off of Lupe's first album. which is freaking awesome since that is easily my favorite Lupe song of all time, not to mention one of my top 25 songs of all time. Now whether it will ever hit that status is unknown, but I'm a sucker for piano beats in rap songs, and this is one of the best I've ever heard. Without a doubt my favorite track from the album.\n\n16. Hood Now (Outro) - 3\/5 Lupe lazily shouts \"Hood Now\" multiple times over a synth dominated beat. It gets pretty boring after a while, there isn't really anything about it that will keep you listening.\n\nClosing Remarks: Lasers was almost panned by audiences everywhere, and for a good reason. It wasn't the Lupe we all know and love, this is. After five years we finally have the Lupe Fiasco album fans have wanted, and it was one darn good ride. Now I'm going to go listen to Unforgivable Youth again.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 8.5\/10","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"On August 10, 2005 Lucinda Williams played at the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh.  It was the last live concert that my wife and I saw together.  Lucinda was touring in support of \"Live @ the Fillmore\" & said she was writing songs for a new record.  As I recall, she played a new song she said she'd recently written, \"Everything Has Changed.\"  I preordered Lucinda's \"West\" set while my wife was still here.  Today marks the fourth week since breast cancer ripped a giant unfillable hole in my universe.  Lucinda lost her mother; and so themes of adjustment to loss not only resonate with me, they punctuate every breath I take.  I spin the CD & Lucinda's gentle aching voice comes on, \"Are you alight?\"  When people ask me that, I want to say, \"He*l no!\"  But when she sings, \"All of a sudden you went away; I hope you come back around someday; I haven't seen you in a real long time; Could you give me some kind of sign?  Are you alright?  ...Cause I've been feeling a little scared,\" it sounds like she's tapped into my inner dialogue as I look toward heaven and speak to the one I love.  What an amazing song, \"Just tell me that you're okay.\"  If this were the only song on the CD, it'd be worth it.\n\n\"Unsuffer Me\" is a grueling unflinching look at the pain of loss.  Sometimes you have to stare it in the face to get through it.  \"Anoint my head with your sweet kiss, my joy is dead; I long for bliss,\" she sings as what I assume is Dan Pettibone's electric guitar churns mercilessly.  Yet somehow the song achieves a magical dignity.  During my wife's last weeks, my daughter said to me, \"It's like watching a train wreck; you can't look away.\"  There something of that strength that comes through in Williams' music.\n\nOther cuts are also amazing.  \"Learning How to Live\" is a breakup song, adjusting to loss.  \"Fancy Funeral\" may sound a bit bizarre, but I can attest that my daddy and I had almost an exact same conversation in 2001 when my mother passed.  The sheer force of Lucinda's anger in \"Come On\" puts a smile on my face as a classic bashed-breakup song, \"Dude, you're so fired; shut up, I'm not inspired.\"  \"Words\" has Lucinda's voice, weathered, worn & laden taking comfort in something she likes best, writing a good song.\n\nYes, Lucinda has an amazing catalog of recordings from \"Happy Woman Blues\" to the self-titled record to Car Wheels & World Without Tears.  \"West\" takes a well deserved place at the table as one of her most compelling, moving works.  Bravo!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Curren$y would be considered a `veteran' (or semi-veteran) in the rap game considering the number of albums and mixtapes he has released over the year. 2012's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Stoned-Immaculate\/dp\/B007W1C5YE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Stoned Immaculate<\/a>, despite his previous releases, is his debut effort on major label Warner Bros.  The results are nothing short of positive as the MC delivers strongly throughout the course of The Stoned Immaculate.  There are no overt misses, though the greatest cuts do overshadow the lesser ones.\n\n\"What It Look Like\" featuring Wale is a soulful, lush way to open the effort.  Lifting from the Philadelphia-soul driven production that made Wale's own&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ambition\/dp\/B005N9EXDI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ambition<\/a>&nbsp;enjoyable, \"What It Look Like\" combines two MC's with solid skills that contrast each others respective styles.  Wale's flow is agile while Curren$y allows for his southern drawl and lazier style to `go to work.'  All is anchored in Wale's simple, though smart and addictive hook: \"Look, what it look like\/ my n---s, fly n----s, this is Jet Life...\"  \"Privacy Glass\" may have a hard act to follow, but gets the job done. Curren$y rolls solo this time, but rides the percussive beat and strings with ease. His flow is casual, but he sells this clever cut well - after all he \"...usually doesn't ride like this\/privacy tinted, professionally driven.\"\n\n\"Armoire\" features Young Roddy & Trademark providing the assist to Curren$y.  The production is a bit odd, but certainly enjoyable with its speaker-rattling bass. \"Armoire\" is not quite as elite as \"What It Look Like\" or \"Privacy Glass,\" but still above average.  Young Roddy & Trademark deliver a sound enough hook while Curren$y handles the verses.  \"Take You There\" featuring Marsha Ambrosius is produced by J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, who give off a `chill' sound.  Ambrosius vocals suit the cut, though she isn't given much chance to ad lib on the simple hook: \"Bright lights, big city\/big cars...so baby you can roll with me\/I'll show you how it's supposed to be.\" While \"Take You There\" is good, it is not quite to the level of its predecessors.  \"Showroom\" also falls into this boat, delivering a sound cut, though not the `best of the best.'\n\n\"Capitol,\" featuring the up-and-coming 2 Chainz restores any conceded momentum or energy.  Both MC's deliver strong verses in this five-minute plus ditty, which features superb old-school, soulful production.  The production itself is mostly a loop with a mobile bass line that `shapes' the overall cut.  While minimal might be the approach, the end results are `excellence.'  The hook is none too shabby either: \"And my reputation precedes me, they already know\/I keep it capital G apostrophe D\/Going hard, making it look easy\/Cause when I do what it do, I do it like I'm doing it for TV.\" \"No Squares\" claims valedictory honors with its slow, grinding tempo and lazy, inherently southern production.  Wiz Khalifa guests here and proves the perfect collaborator for Curren$y - \"I'm rolling up an insane amount of smoke\/diamonds all up in the chain around my throat...\" he boasts at the beginning of his verse.  The hook is killer: \"No square shall enter in the circle of winners... ain't been like none of them n---s as far as I can remember...\"\n\n\"Sunroof,\" featuring Corner Boy P brings the effort back to earth after its lofty ascent, but still remains strong.  The use of 808 complements the other drum programming well here, adding some extra `punctuation.' \"Chasin' Papers\" `brings back' the swagger of \"No Squares\" delivering an odd-ball collaboration with Pharrell Williams (The Neptunes produce).  Pharrell's somewhat weak, though distinct voice works perfectly here to deliver one of the more left-brain hooks: \"I know I was there so I seen and did what you up to\/I know you're chasing the paper\/I know that you scared but it's there and the girls wanna [....] you\/I know you're chasing that paper..\"  Not to be outdone by Pharrell, Estelle delivers grace and excellence on the more romantic \"That's the Thing,\" in which she proudly sings \"...you're everything thing...see that's the thing, yea that's the thing...\" On the bridge, unlike with Marsha Ambrosius on \"Take You There,\" Estelle is given breathing room to `shine'.\n\n\"Chandelier\" features those good ole soulful, dusty beats and bass line, though at over five minutes unlike the other `fivers,' it lacks the substance to be as effective.  \"Fast Cars Faster Women\" featuring and produced by Daz Dillinger works well, with its soulful production.  Curren$y is definitely in his zone as is Dillinger's clearer, contrasting rap vocals on verse two.  The album ends with the Big K.R.I.T produced \"Jet Life,\" which possesses an old-school, southern hip-hop sound. It doesn't end the album with the zest that \"What It Look Like\" opens it with, but at this point, Curen$y has already proven himself.\n\nA solid album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Stoned-Immaculate\/dp\/B007W1C5YE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Stoned Immaculate<\/a>&nbsp;has no major flaws.

{"text":"I thought that Ruthie's last CD \"Let it burn\" was really excellent and on the first couple of listens I think that this new record is just as good, if not better. Meshell Ndegeocello is in the producer's chair and also plays bass and she does a great job - this is wonderful sounding record - and the musicians that she brought with her - guitarist Chris Bruce, keyboard player Jebin Bruni, drummer Ivan Edwards and Nayanna Holley on backing vocals - all do a first class job. Add guests Ruthie's fellow Texan guitarist Doyle Bramhall II and singer Toshi Reagon for a bit of variety on some tracks. This record again has elements of soul, rock, blues and gospel but all presented in a very original and professional manner and all built around Ruthie's fabulous voice - I get annoyed when lesser voices are compared to Aretha but in Ruthie's case the comparisons are fully justified.\n\n\"Singing the blues\" (not the Melvin Endsley song covered by Guy Mitchell) is a great way to start, a melodic funky mid-tempo rocker and the following \"Let me know\" is even better, a tougher bluesy rocker featuring Doyle Bramhall II's excellent slide guitar. \"My kinda lover\" is a lovely tuneful song with tremendous old-style soul rhythm guitar from Chris Bruce and \"The ghetto\" sounds like classic Staples Singers, with \"Brand new day\" also being soulful modern day gospel. I wasn't too keen on \"Outlaw\" - I can't really see myself singing \"She's a sister in jeans, she's an outlaw she don't wear a bra\" but I guess the song isn't aimed at me. \"Second coming\" is probably the most acoustic song here, referencing Ruthie's past and \"Complicated love\" and \"New\" also start off acoustic before building and filling out. \"Believe\" is the album's most bluesy song and at this stage probably my favourite track but this is such a rich record with so many wonderful melodic songs. Ruthie and Meshell have created an excellent record here that focusses on original songs rather than covers and deserves to be widely heard and if there was any justice it would be a huge hit.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I have honestly adored Coldplay for the past decade, not only because they have had some really good songs that have been very down to Earth like Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall, and the melodic Clocks. But overall what Chris Martin and the guys have done is really made definitive music that stands high in the pillars that artists like Elton John and Phil Collins have done. But the past couple of years they haven't really hit the nail on the head with success in their music. While they have had some great songs like A Sky Full Of Stars and the intimate Paradise, but overall they have lost a bit of the shine. Their latest single Hymn For The Weekend from Coldplay's album A Head Full Of Dreams plays more like a hip hop and rock style in their work, teaming up with Beyonce' Knowles whom has no chemistry with their sound, just like what Coldplay did with Rihanna a few years ago on Princess Of China. She didn't actually bring more of her A-Game into the work, just felt more she wanted Chris to shine alone, and it didn't ignite. I really do expect Coldplay's next single to be better than the lagging songs they have came out with recently. This hymn didn't exactly feel like a lifetime at the soul.\n\nSong: C 1\/2+","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"I bought the album this morning and around the third time around, I started thinking, as another person said, this is the strongest record since Countdown. Don't get me wrong, I thought The System Has Failed, Endgame, and Thirteen were great albums, but the bottom line is that this album is a THRASH METAL album, and Megadeth hasn't made one in the true sense of the term since Countdown. This album has an edge, a CRUNCH that slipped away in 93 when they started hiring stylists and changing their image\/sound in Dave's two decade hunt for Grammy.\n\nMy theory is this... after Supercollider's (and Dave's final) misstep, he finally realized that the ingredients it takes a pop musician to make a successful hit, is not the same as what it takes for Megadeth to make a successful hit. In other words, tossing in a beat or polished producton or a modern sound is just going to cause the album to flop in the metal community and go unheard of in the mainstream.\n\nThere are no \"Blackest Crow\"s or \"I'll Be There\"s. Dave seems to have come to terms with the fact that although he'll never get the Best Album award he's always wanted, he can still be a king amongst the smaller but still strong metal fan base. He focused all that resentment and anger in the right direction for once and finally did what he does best.\n\nThis record is perfect, front to back. Every song can hold its own and I think that's what helps this album gel and flow with a consistency also lacking since the early 90s.\n\nOne other thing I'd like to point out... if you've been a Megadeth fan for at least 8-10 years, you probably rolled your eyes and chuckled (like I did) while reading those interviews from the past few months about Kiko and Chris being the \"best musicians ever to be in the band\". Not because they aren't, but because that's the first thing that comes out of his mouth every time they get new members. HOWEVER, you can probably argue them not being the BEST, but as he said, they do bring a sound to the table that has never been present in a MD record. I found myself very pleasantly surprised on almost every song because of new techniques and ideas.\n\nDo not hesitate to buy this album as you will not be disappointed if you're a Megadeth fan or just a metal fan. This is not another Risk or Supercollider package of pop experimentation or varied styles... this is a THRASH record. It's right there with Rust in Peace and SF, SG...SW! in my list of favorites.\n\nCome to think of it, had Dave kept his focus following his brush with mainstream fame in 92, THIS is the record that should have come out in 94.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"The posthumous DECCA label LP, PATSY CLINE 12 GREATEST HITS was the #1 best-selling country music album until the 1990s.\n\nAll tracks are AAD stereo dubs, including \"Walkin' After Midnight,\" a remake of her 1957 hit. The six panel insert provides a bio, editorial, chronology, Cline MCA album catalog and complete session personnel for all tracks.\n\nPatsy not only was the first woman to ever \"close\" various artist concerts and Grand Ole Opry broadcasts, she was also one of the earliest country stars to cross over into mainstream pop.

{"text":"In 1980 when \"Keep On Loving You\" hit the airwaves I was a couple years out of college and grateful for the passing of disco as I was finding my footing in my first \"real\" career job. Speedwagon's music fit perfectly with my life and the intense emotions of a young adult out in the world. Keep On Loving You brings back a real mix of feelings and reminds me how I was feeling back in those days..\n\nKeep On Loving you was especially timely as it hit the airwaves just when a relationship which seemed to have great promise fell apart. I got the \"Hi Infidelity\" album and recorded it to cassette to play in my car. Pretty much all of the Hi Infidelity music fits into my category of driving music. I wore that old cassette out and hard to record another.\n\nI don't have cassettes any more but the MP3 I have hooked into my car audio features \"Keep On Loving You\" prominently on my driving playlist and I still love driving beat and smooth harmony of the vocals.\n\nREO Speedwagon's \"Keep On Loving You\" and the whole \"High Infidelity\" album have stood the test of time and hold up well for me even 35 years later. It's great music to listen to while driving and takes me back to a intense emotional time in my life. I think it's an essential track whether you were coming into age in 1980 or caught it much later. It stands the test of time and is worthy of 5 stars from me.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"This is really a cute, tongue-in-cheek song with a simple melody, accompanied primarily by piano and snare drums.  The tone of the piece is fun and the lyrics make it funny (and oh so true).  It is not a loud piece; it just goes along with its light marching rhythm, breaks into a sweet,pretty, string-accompanied interlude of reminiscences and then returns to the chore of toy extraction. It sounds like it could have been pulled right out of a modern Christmas musical.\n\nIt describes the yearly chore and frustration of removing toys from their complicated and difficult to remove packaging. I think most of us can relate to that, especially those hermetically-sealed, clear plastic enclosures that can only be opened with scissors, a sharp knife or wire-cutters, and of course, you'll need antiseptic and bandages for cuts you get from the sharp edges.  Sadly, little children cannot open these packages like they used to in the \"old days\".\n\nCatchy tune! This should be a song you will want to play every year.

Though it was released several decades before, it is a classic, entertaining and completely delightful CD.\nThese songs are silly, deliciously without any message. \"A Spoonful Sugar\" (helps the medicine go dow-own!) is as meaningless as it is catchy. Don't be embarrassed after a few listens, that you, an adult, are caught up in public whistling \"Chim Chim Cher-ee.\"\nThe music seems a million miles away from the canned pop tunes Disney cranks out now. Don't get me wrong, I love \"Aladdin\" and \"Beauty and the Beast\" but there is a point at which today's Disney seems to be written to meet a market need than for the pure love of music.\nAmong my prouder moments in grade school was being able to spell 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,' and that I could say it without stumbling over each syllable.\nI fully recommend \"Mary Poppins: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack.\"\nAnthony Trendl","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Ripe with possibilities Apple Records was The Beatles chance to establish a label that didn't play the same games that the big labels played and take artistic risks. It also gave them a tax shelter. The label fell short of its goal for a variety of reasons (including the dissolution of The Beatles themselves shortly after forming the label)BUT it did result in a variety of artists some of whom went on to much bigger careers AFTER Apple (James Taylor, Billy Preston, Hot Chocolate), some of whom had big hits for the label (Badfinger)and some of whom disappeared into obscurity.\n\nThis collection takes singles from albums released by Apple as well as single-only releases for a variety of artists. The only place to find these single only releases is here on this compilation. The only thing that MIGHT have improved this set is to include the b-sides for each artists singles. The mastering sounds pretty good and it was done by the same EMI team that remastered The Beatles, John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Badfinger catalogs for CD.\n\n\"Those Were The Days\" was a hit single for Welsh singer Mary Hopkins who also turned the Paul McCartney penned \"Goodbye\" into a hit single as well.\n\n\"Carolina on My Mind\"-James Taylor would go on to bigger hits after his producer and manager Peter Asher left Apple. Taylor would re-record this later.\n\n\"Maybe Tomorrow\" was a single by Mal Evans' discovery The Iveys who would undergo a name change (Badfinger) and score four top 20 hits before tragedy struck the band.\n\n\"Thingumbob\" is a McCartney penned song by The Black Dyke Mills Band a favorite brass band of McCartney's.(Exclusive to this release)\n\n\"King of Fuh\" was a novelty song that Apple picked up and was recorded by Brute Force. It's the story of the Fuh King (yep, say that fast and you'll understand WHY it was never released and WHY John and George love it. (Exclusive to this release)\n\n\"Sour Milk Sea\" written by George Harrison was recorded by Jackie Lomax a long time friend and musician that was signed to the label after his stint with The Undertakers was over. The song was a White Album demo that was rejected for the album and features George & Eric Clapton on guitars, Paul McCartney on bass, Ringo Starr on drums and Nicky Hopkins on keyboards. Lomax's R&B influenced \"New Day\" also appears.\n\n\"That's the Way God Planned It\" and \"My Sweet Lord\" were singles from Billy Preston's two albums that he recorded for Apple.\n\n\"Try Some Buy Some\" was a single recorded by Ronnie Spector written by George and produced by Phil Spector. It is exclusive to this set and although not a great track (and the music appeared with additional overdubbing on George's \"Living in the Material World\"). It's not a great track but it's nice to have it.\n\n\"Come and Get It\" recorded by Badfinger was written and produced by Paul McCartney for the band's first album. We also get Badfinger's Pete Ham's songs \"Day After Day\" produced by and featuring George Harrison on slide with Ham included as well.\n\n\"Golden Slumbers\/Carry That Weight\" recorded by Trash was a single of The Beatles tracks (exclusive to this set).\n\n\"Saturday Nite Special\" by the Sundown Playboys and \"We're On Our Way\" by Hodge are both exclusive to this CD as well. (both exclusive to this set)\n\n\"God Save Us\" by Bill Elliot and The Oz Band was written and performed by John Lennon and cohorts (no, not the other Beatles)and a single only release (exclusive to this set).\n\n\"Sweet Music\" recorded and written by Lon and Derrek Van Eaton is exclusive to this set. We also get Radha Krsna Temple's \"Govinda\".\n\nWe also get a single recorded by Hot Chocolate who later went on to have more hit singles away from Apple (\"You Sexy Thing\").\n\nThe 12 page booklet includes information on each recording artist included in this set.\n\nThis is a nice set for those who only want the singles released from Apple or the exclusive songs to this set.\n\nIt's a pity that there aren't any unreleased tracks here such as George's original demo for \"Sour Milk Sea\" with the same line up (except for Lomax) as it's pretty darn close to the exact line up for \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" but what we do get it quite good and for an anthology of what Apple put out this is very good indeed.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I don't think there has been a more definitive example of \"fusion\" in music history as with Earth Wind & Fire.  Now I'm not talking Fusion like in Jazz (which by definition IS fusion, like in Fused On) no, I'm talking Jazz Funk Rhythm & Blues Afro-Latin Gumbo Rock!  Dig That Fusion Baby!  Artists like Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations were producing progressive concept oriented albums that were catching the ears of listeners to the new progressive genres of Mahavishnu Orchestra, Santana, Traffic, Pink Floyd, Genesis, even Yes and ELP; and of course the progressive jazz of Creed Taylor's stable of jazz giants.  Earth Wind & Fire caught on quickly on campuses and their first two albums released on Warner Brothers' label (not represented here of course) got word of mouth disease, it was jazzy, funky, rock-drenched R&B and if you were an early acolyte to Chicago, this music was not a stretch at all, especially if you were also a fan of War, with or without Eric Burdon.\n\nSo this groovy 17-track single disc compendium of EARTH WIND & FIRE GREATEST HITS on the Columbia Legacy label is brilliantly engineered and sonically perfect for the fan who wants to light up their music collection with something essential.  The tracks are arranged in a rather organic order, not chronological but lending to a greater overarching feel of the evolution of their music.  Listen to Can't Hide Love and try not to think about \"smooth jazz\" a decade later, way ahead of its time, way!  This GH collection is pretty definitive and so well mastered it is the only 5 Star rated EWF album in the All Music Guide.  It contains all of The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire (1978) save the weakish Love Music, six of the 10 best from Best Of Volume 2, and has added the stupendous Kalimba Story (from Open Our Eyes, '74) and the title epic from Gratitude ('75).  Even if you have most of their studio releases, how can you live with yourself without the singles only September and Beatles cover Got To Get You Into My Life!\n\nThe CD comes with full music and track credits, a terrific bio (The Eternal Groove) by pop culture geek Mark Coleman and an intensely in-depth history (The Earth Wind & Fire Family Tree by Kevin Goins and Leo Sacks) all packaged with some beautiful artwork (always a staple of EWF albums).  Earth Wind & Fire were always a spiritually based group, full of positive vibrations and inner peace, Soul Food To Go as the Manhattan Transfer called it.

{"text":"I was lucky enough to first see James Taylor live in a small outdoor venue  called Avaloch in rural Lenox, Massachusetts in the summer of 1970, after  this first album recorded by the Beatles in London had been released and  just before the release of the fabulously successful \"Sweet Baby James\"  album by Warner Brothers. He appeared alone on-stage with a full head of  long, long hair in a simple denim shirt and cut-up jeans with his four or  five acoustic guitars, and for two and a half hours proceeded to absolutely  enchant the sprawling lawn-full of hundreds of audience members with a  spellbinding performance of all of the work from both of those albums.  Although virtually unknown at the time, word of mouth had spread so quickly  in the Berkshires area (who still considers him one of their own) that many  of us went out to get this album to play before he appeared. The rest, as  they say, is history.\nThis is a fantastic retrospective collection of  his greatest hits recorded live, and as one would expect of the amazing Mr.  Taylor, it is a terrific summary of that work. Many of my favorites are  here, including \"Something In The Way She Moves\", \"Carolina In My Mind\",  and \"Rainy Day Man\". Of course, so is \"Fire And Rain\", \"You've Got A  Friend\", \"Steamroller Blues\", and a wonderful combination of \"Millworker\"  and \"Country Road\", which are both among the best songs he has ever  written.  My all time favorite song from this album is \"Sweet Baby James\",  which is sung about the Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts where I  grew up, so I have always considered this a special song.  His performance  on it is a brilliant illustration of just how incredibly talented an  interpretive artist Taylor really is. He always pleases with songs like  \"Copperline\", \"Mexico\", and \"Walking Man\", and this album is sure to please  even the most cautious music fan. It is certainly a terrific showcase for  how well Taylor can deliver on a variety of original works and covers of  traditional folk songs. Enjoy","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Stevie Wonder is amazing!!! During his nearly 40 years at Motown he produced some of the finest pop, soul and R&B records of the period. I cannot think of any other artist who does what Stevie does. He is a first rate singer\/songwriter\/multi-instrumentalist and producer. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame saw fit to make Stevie one of their earliest inductees way back in 1989.\n\nNow during the 1960's Stevie Wonder made quite a few memorable records. You might recall his first big hit \"Fingertips - Pt 2\" which went all the way to the top of the charts in 1963! \"Little\" Stevie Wonder was just 12 years old when this tune was recorded and it quickly became obvious to all that this young man was a star in the making. One of my favorite Stevie Wonder discs was his rollicking 1966 hit \"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\". The tune peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart in early 1966, at the same time reaching the top of the Billboard R&B Singles chart for five big weeks. Billboard ranked it as the 59th biggest American hit of 1966. The success of \"Uptight\" only reinforced the notion that Stevie Wonder was going to be a major player in popular music for many years to come.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Wow! Finally I can quit whining about The Wreckers breaking up! I'll caveat this review with my prejudice: I think Miranda Lambert is arguably the greatest overall talent to ever hit Nashville. This album really is classic Miranda, sassy, sweet, smartass white trash, and always on target. The addition of Angaleena and Ashley adds impressive dimension, and their contributions in writing and vocals are substantial. This is hardcore country, from writing to instrumentals. There's not a weak song on the album; in a fair world they're all hits, but I guess a few radio station program managers might need to grow up, get real, lose some piety and develop a sense of humor for that to happen. This album is the kind of stuff that made country music great, its ground zero and real with old time rural irony, all traits most modern country music is sadly lacking. Every song blew me away. Ok, I'm starting to ramble, but because I really want to say I like the Pistol Annies even more than Miranda by herself, and that would be blasphomy.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"\"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\" comes from Paul Simon's 1972 self-titled album; and it sure sounds great! True, there has been debate as to what exactly happens in the story Paul sings of--but make no mistake about it, this tune is a masterpiece and I like how anyone can interpret it their own way. Was \"MaMa Pajama\" really a welfare mother who didn't like seeing someone involved in a $exual act and ran to the police to report it--and then when \"the radical priest come to get me released\" was the guy Paul sings of and anyone else involved  truly on the cover of Newsweek to gain national attention? It's possible! We also don't know who is Rosie, the \"Queen of Corona\" and precisely how is Julio involved in this? Again, it's all open to interpretation like an awesome work of modern art.\n\nIn addition, the musical arrangement fits in very well with Paul's vocals. He simply couldn't have performed this any better. \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\" remains one of his best songs ever.\n\nThank you, Paul Simon!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"This box is a special compilation - created with a combination of respect for the Bach Guild\/Vanguard catalog and an eye toward our faithful customers who have supported the Bach Guild since we first released our first digital boxed set 2 1\/2 years ago.\n\nIn working with the Bach Guild catalog, and in our brainstorming phase, we looked at creating a Big Bach Set that focused on the vast amount of choral recordings in our catalog. We knew what was in the catalog, but it wasn't until we sat down and started to compile the master audio files that it became clear what we could put together. Rather than creating a \"greatest hits of choral music\" boxed set, we decided to create a box based on two criterion. First we whittled the time frame down to the Renaissance time period, and secondly, we wanted to present a box that drew on recordings that had not been available in a very long time.\n\nWe didn't set out that way but in the process of developing the box, it soon became clear that these two guidelines could be met and could create one heck of an interesting Big Bach Set. And it would clearly show off the tremendous catalog of The Bach Guild, and we'd give our loyal listeners a real treat, because several of the most recent boxes have focused on quite a bit of previously released material - and this box is perhaps the largest collection of unreleased material that we have put together.\n\nThe genesis of this recording is the drive to finally release the Monteverdi Vespers of 1610 in the Denis Stevens edition. At the time this edition was published, Mr. Stevens had established himself as (perhaps) the leading scholar in the music and performance practice of Monteverdi.\n\nMany of our readers and listeners will know of Mr. Stevens, and he is instrumental in the history of the Bach Guild's recordings of choral music through the 1950s and early 1960s. Mr. Stevens had a prestigious career as a writer in England - he became the editor of The Grove Encyclopedia - and worked with Seymour Solomon (who loved the interaction with the academics when creating his recordings) as Vanguard grew quickly and proved its bona fides as pioneers of early music performance.\n\nHowever, Mr. Stevens was also a bold and outspoken writer who differed greatly with the techniques of the nascent early music movement - and he used his pulpit to rail against the developing attitudes of the leading lights of the movement, many of whom were recording with The Bach Guild, and whose talents were much in demand. And his sarcastic descriptions of the early instrument movement were very much at odds with the early music tastemakers, as you might tell from the tone of an excerpt from \"On Performing Monteverdi's Vespers\", which set in motion Stevens' departure from the Vanguard\/Bach Guild circle:\n\n1. Instruments. It is generally assumed that your first move, as conductor, would be to join an \"auncient ynstrument clubb\" in order to organize exponents of \"baroque\" string instruments, harpsichords, lutes, theorboes, and sackbuts. Nothing could be further from the true aim and object. Not one of these flukes ever formed part of the instrumentarium of St. Mark's Venice, where Monteverdi was director of music from 1613 until 1643. They were never used in the basilica for the simple reason that the size and acoustic would make any one of them sound like a mouse breaking wind, and that is not what the composer wanted.\n\nNow, reading this in 2014 seems quaint and charming, and very funny. The entire essay, which is very informative and entertainingly written, is available on www.scholaantiqua.net, but its publication set in motion a series of problems that ultimately led to The Bach Guild and Mr. Stevens parting ways.\n\nMr. Stevens' albums stayed in the Vanguard vaults for a long time - as noted in readers' reviews, the albums were released in the late 1960s but were completed long before that. And none of these titles, despite their focus on very rarely recorded repertoire, were ever considered for release on compact disc during the Vanguard \"Omega\" years, and this release marks their first public availability in probably 40 years.\n\nOh, this could be the longest blog ever - there is so much other history here, as this shows the voracious desire for this music exhibited by performers and by The Bach Guild. But the depth is what is amazing - frankly, we cut off this box at the Renaissance - there is easily another box just for Baroque and Classical era music that has a bit more visibility in the marketplace, but would still be about 10 hours long and about half of those recordings have not been available since their LP release.\n\nJust to rattle off the names and projects - and to fill in some gaps:\n\n1. Nicola Vincentino - by our research there is no LP or CD length recording of the music of Vincentino (fascinating to scholars, he invented a microtonal system of his own). Unfortunately, the masters available to us have sound issues that would not allow us to release the entire LP (we do NOT master from LPs, only from approved digital sources which contain problems that are traced to the master tape).\n2. The DeLassus masses were originally issued on BG 651 or in stereo as BGS 5063, but only the Missa Bell'amfitrit'altera is listed in official Vanguard catalog listing, but in the original matrix card listings (which list the running order of each master tape) the second mass was listed. And as far as we can discover, there are no other recordings of this mass (and we have authenticated it is a work by DeLassus).\n3. The Josquin de Prez \"L'homme arme\" recording was never released on CD but was released on LP as HM 3.\n4. The Palestrina 5 Motets was released on LP originally as BG 647, which would indicate that it was recorded in the mid 1950s. It was reissued\n5. In response to an earlier post, the Dufay\/Obrecht LP number is BG 653 or BGS 70653. We have used what we believe is the stero master (BGS 70653). The LP indicated 5 Marian hymns were also available, but our masters did not include these works, or we would have included them in this compilation.\n6. The original LP release for the Giaches deWert was entitled \"Music from the Court of Mantua\", on Vanguard's budget label \"Cardinal\", VCS 10083, to confirm the accurate guess made by an earlier reviewer.\n7. The hymns from Washington Cathedral were from a Vanguard LP VRS 1036, or stereo LP VCS 2021. Half of this LP is music of the Renaissance, the second side was all contemporary composers. One contemporary track was released on a music devoted to the music of Samuel Barber. None of the other tracks have been released.\n\nAnd a couple of points to leave - there may be some sonic glitches on these tapes, we have tried to eliminate as many flaws as we could, but many of the masters were problematic. Major flaws disqualified an issue from release, some pops were allowed to allow this music to see the light of day after 50+ years.\n\nAnd the second point - thank you for your enthusiasm - we appreciate it, and we are working on a few other releases before the end of the year that will feature more unreleased material.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Slow Train Coming is Bob Dylan's religious album, or rather, the beginning of a religious-based period of albums that progressed into the early 80's.  If THIS is what I can expect for the rest of this particular period, well... I probably won't even bother.  This is disappointing enough.\n\n\"Gotta Serve Somebody\" has lyrics that explain no matter WHO you are, you're gonna have to serve *somebody*.  The slow-paced disco beats and the straight forward lyrics leave a lot to be desired, however.  The disco connection unfortunately sets the pace for the rest of the experience which, judging by the numerous positive reviews here on amazon, might make this the most overrated album in Dylan's discography.  \"Precious Angel\" is generic mid-tempo plodding nonsense from beginning to end.  This is by FAR the worst Dylan album up to this point.  Self Portrait had variety at least.  Slow Train Coming, musically, is a product of the times- the dreaded days of the disco movement.  Yuck.  The \"Shine your light on me\" chorus is almost sickeningly uncharacteristic of Dylan.  You can tell he's forcing himself to sing such a line, and I swear I can almost sense that he's about ready to break out laughing during the chorus.  The only compliment I can give is that the Jerry Garcia-inspired guitar playing is decent.\n\n\"I Believe In You\" includes a melody so soft that it's basically a lullaby with terribly bland, simplistic and lovey dovey lyrics.  Anyone who believes Dylan can't write vocal melodies would have a good point here.  Normally I'd disagree with those people but not in this case.  \"Slow Train\" has a somewhat groovy rhythm, okay lyrics about a woman down in Alabama and figuring out and establishing your principles.  The guitar solo is actually really good.  Best song so far.  \"Gonna Change My Way of Thinking\" is a MAJOR low point.  Unsatisfying and disappointing Joe Walsh style mid-tempo hard rock with a VERY lackluster heavy guitar riff chugging along for the entire duration.  I'm mystified how so many Dylan fans can easily forgive such a failed experiment.\n\n\"Do Right To Me Baby (Do Unto Others)\" is where the religious lyrics are beginning to overstay their welcome as they're now becoming excessively irritating.  The bigger problem however is that there's *still* very little in the way of exciting musical ideas taking place here.  The songwriting is definitely uninteresting to me.  Just because Dylan finally revealed his feelings on religious matters doesn't automatically mean these songs are a pleasure to hear.  \"When You Gonna Wake Up\" is lyrically quite tedious and straight forward despite Dylan telling it like it is.  I'm sorry but this song sounds WAY too similar to Dire Strait's \"In the Gallery\" released a year before.  Same vocal mannerisms and punchy rhythm.  I *do* like how the tempo picks up during the chorus at least.  Yes and I'm aware that members of Dire Straits participated on this album so Mark Knopfler's style was bound to be noticeable either way but eh... I also have mixed feelings when the Band joined Dylan.  When you combine two artists with a distinctive style the result is that it usually limits the potential of *both* artists, or rather, encourages them both to hold back their full scope of creativity which is the case here with Dylan and Knopfler.\n\n\"Man Gave Name to All the Animals\" is a reggae style tune with a strong appearance of female vocals.  Dylan's voice is exceptionally hoarse but both the verse AND the chorus are oddly melodic and appealing to me.  This song almost sounds cute!  Definitely the most unusual song on the album.  It avoids resembling generic disco beats at least.  \"When He Returns\" is a piano ballad but... this is no ordinary piano playing!  It's VERY spiritual, uplifting, and emotionally a highlight.  Maybe even the best song on the album both lyrically and musically.  Great way to end the album.\n\nMan, I don't know guys.  Songs such as \"Gotta Serve Somebody\", \"Precious Angel\", \"I Believe In You\" and ESPECIALLY \"Gonna Change My Way of Thinking\" are REALLY unappealing to me.  I suppose the rest of the material is passable but come on, Dylan's first religious-themed album is hardly flawless.  Look beyond the lyrics and notice the mediocre songwriting covering up most of the album.  On a final note just let me mention that I have no problem whatsoever with the lyrics.  Dylan covers religion exceptionally well and his conversion to Christianity is commendable, but I wouldn't expect any less from the master of creative wordplay.  Besides, every Christian I've ever known has always been super polite and supportive towards me and my decisions.  The problem I have with the album is that the music doesn't match the lyrics.  Not many (if any) artists entered the dreaded, horribly dated days of the disco movement and came out with flying colors.  It's just impossible for me to look beyond the generic music and focus on the lyrics.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"Most of the reviews for this album are five stars, so I'm expecting some people to click the \"NO\" button by looking at my rating alone. But anyway, the first time I ever heard of Gavin DeGraw was when I saw him on Last Call with Carson Daly (don't ask me why I was watching that). And his song \"Follow Through\" is pretty good, so I decided to see what his album, Chariot, was like.\nThere are some other good songs on here, like the title track and the song he has out now, \"I Don't Want to Be\". And when I looked at the lyrics to \"Meaning\", I said, \"Oh boy, not another we-are-the-world song.\" But that song actually works pretty well. My favorite song on the album, though, would have to be the smooth \"More Than Anyone\".\nAs far as the rest of the songs go, they leave something to be desired, especially the filler track \"(Nice to Meet You) Anyway\". \"Chemical Party\" and \"Belief\" have rather stupid lyrics, and \"Just Friends\" is fine until Gavin says something about that her body fits him like a glove.\nI don't really Chariot is worth ALL the hype, but it's still a nice album to play to pass the time.\nAnthony Rupert","classification":3,"fold":7}

A young boy's mother sending over thing to this lonely old man. A young boy sitting on the porch swing listening to the wisdom that his friend has earned. Passing on the wisdom he learn from reading the bible; \"the words written in red\" was mentioned. Some versions of the bible had Jesus's words printed in red, so the bible reader knew who was speaking. This old man said to the boy, he would see his wife and child soon. He also said as he aged he drew more strengh from the words written in red.  He didn't believe that life ended in a slow ride in a hearse.  He knew of a place that Jesus said he would prepare for his followers who remain faithful a place where his own wife and child were already there.\n\nThen the Boy grows up and he is in college, his Mom and he were talking about the thing happening in the small town he grew up in. Finally she tells her son that the old man who was his best friend had died.\n\nLater in bed that night he says to himself, he didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

Riding his Harley, he rides in and out of other peoples' lives and seems to be a catalyst for resolving their issues, instead of his own. The closing theme to the show became the title song for this album, and both Parks and the music are better than they have a right to be. Parks has a quiet and rough quality to his voice-rather like his character-and it serves this collection of less-known and well-known standards, as well as the originals, well. He even tackles 'Melancholy Baby' and pulls it off. It doesn't hurt to have James Burton backing him up, along with other fine musicians. The arrangements and overall sound are dated, but entirely appropriate for the time in which this was recorded. If you recall that series-or if you just want something gently nostalgic, this album, along with the others Mr. Parks released, will satisfy.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"In debating whether to give this album four stars or five, I listened to it for a third time and realized that it stands out as being a complete pop album. Even the extra tracks on the deluxe edition have no weak moments. I mean, how many pop albums out there offer 16 tracks with NO FILLER? To be honest, I didn't think Ke$ha had an album like this in her, especially as a sophomore effort, on which even the best and most popular artists tend to struggle.\n\nKe$ha gets everything right here; she writes great hooks and still keeps her party-heavy persona, she is not afraid to rap often (and quite well), and she has apparently learned to play several instruments as well. While \"Animal\" and \"Cannibal\" had several songs with great hooks, there were a number of filler tracks or just annoying tracks on those two albums, making her sound juvenile and even uninterested at times. But she is fully engaged here. So many potential singles, the smash \"Die Young\" is obvious, and a few others (\"C'Mon\" and \"Crazy Kids\") may make the grade as well. But the real standout is towards the end of the album, \"Gold Trans Am,\" in which she succeeds in bridging the gap between electro-heavy pop and classic rock and roll. Many artists attempted to expand on the electro pop sound (Aguilera, Gaga, etc) while others just keep churning out the same stuff (like Katy Perry, Rihanna). But Ke$ha is evolving rapidly and taking huge steps toward not only credibility, but excellence as both a songwriter and a pop star. Who would have thought, after hearing \"Animal,\" that she was capable of this on her sophomore album? Certainly not this reviewer. 4.5 stars.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"From what I gather about Jeanne Robertson, she doesn't consider herself a \"stand-up comic\" so much as \"public speaker,\" but make no mistake about it - she is as funny as anyone in the business.  She comes from a little corner of North Carolina, and if Mayberry actually existed, you wouldn't have difficulty imagining that her home must be just up the road a spell from Andy and Barney.\n\nI recently had my first exposure to the Sirius radio network, and tracks from this \"Flat-Out Funny\" recording were prominently rotated between Bill Cosby and Jeff Foxworthy.  It is no faint praise to say that Jeanne Robertson is as funny as any of them.\n\nHer stories are full of wry and hilarious insights into the human condition, and it appears that any obstacle in her life simply becomes \"new material\".  This also seems to mean that anyone in her life is \"fair game\" for inclusion in her routines.  We hear many details about her husband, Jerry \"Leftbrain\", including his hesitation to accompany her on a near-disastrous eight-day rafting trip through the grand canyon, which included recreational opportunities such as hanging precariously from the side of a cliff, using AARP-vintage hands that at home would have difficulty opening a jar in the kitchen.\n\nThis recording is an absolute obvious choice for that person or family or group who wants to hear \"flat-out funny\" comedy that is suitable for all ears, but the truth is that she is also as funny as the comedians who use the full spectrum of language.\n\nFlat-Out recommended.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"The cover of newcomer Easton Corbin's self-titled debut depicts a homespun image of the singer-songwriter strumming an acoustic while relaxing on a porch in a wicker rocking chair. It's an apt picture. The album strips away much of Nashville's contemporary bombast in favor of the relaxed country vibe of Kenny Chesney and Alan Jackson. The comparison is particularly close in the sunny satisfaction and road trip escape of \"Roll With it,\" the forthright statement of home-spun roots \"A Little More Country Than That,\" and multiple mentions of good times and simple pleasures. Corbin and his co-writers have pulled together a collection of love songs, both warm and broken-hearted, and link Chesney with Tom T. Hall by drawing a blue line from Memphis to Key West in \"This Far From Memphis.\" There's a moving lyric of imagined nostalgia in \"Someday When I'm Old\" and the second-chance glimpsed in \"Let Alone You\" is illustrated with sharply observed everyday details.\n\nA few of the songs are a bit close to their inspirations for comfort. \"Don't Ask Me `Bout a Woman\" rewrites the sentiment and mood of Brad Paisley's \"Waitin' on a Woman,\" and the sandy vacation of \"A Lot to Learn About Livin'\" is third-generation Jimmy Buffett by way of Kenny Chesney. Corbin's vocals are lightly drawled and producer Carson Chamblerlain counts out a variety of tempos that allow is singer to show off his emotional prowess as both a balladeer and mid-tempo honky-tonker. The album closes with the thoughtful \"Leavin' a Lonely Town,\" echoing the escapes and traps of Steve Earle's \"Guitar Town\" and Chris Knight's \"Oil Patch Town.\" The sound is Nashville clean, but it's not slickly artificial; it's sophisticated in the manner of George Strait and others able to hang on to their country roots even as they embrace modern studio production. 3-1\/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

{"text":"Some say that good talent is difficult to find to day. Many say that R&B and soul are dead.  Gareth Daley, known merely as Daley, refutes both of these statements.  The 23-year old British soul singer is both an exceptional vocalist and gifted songwriter. Over the course of these six songs on this brief 22:59, something must be wrong if you are not converted to a fan who hopes Daley can make his mark on the music world, specifically for R&B.  Soulful, touching, sensual, and thoughtful are just a few adjectives to describe Daley and fourth quarter 2012 EP,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Alone-Together-EP\/dp\/B009Y6YINQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Alone Together EP<\/a>.\n\nContemporary R&B duet \"Alone Together\" opens the effort, pairing Daley with another British soul singer, Marsha Ambrosius. The chemistry between the two is perfect, most capitalized during\/after the bridge. Add lush production and thoughtful songwriting to the commanding vocals exhibited, and you have one strong opening cut. \"You're the desert sand, I'll be your water  and you're the perfect plan I never thought of...\" Solid, good stuff.\n\nDaley rolls solo on \"Blame the World\", which is dramatic, soulful, and powerful. \"Betrayed your one and only \/ the tears fell now you're lonely \/ now you wanna blame the world...\" Daley croons on the chorus.  He then ascends into his falsetto at the peak singing \"Feel the walls tearing down \/ it's your fault when you hit the ground \/ now you wanna blame the world \/ now you wanna blame the world.\"  The drama is heightened by well conceived, soul styled production including synthesized strings, piano, swirls of organ, and horns. On the bridge, a military marching snare provides separation and differentiation from verses and chorus, showcasing the maturity of conception of the cut.\n\nContemporary soul crossover with jazz on \"Game Over\", a cut that shows off Daley's falsetto more liberally, particularly by the end.  Single \"Remember Me\" keeps up the valedictory momentum, yielding a more pop-contemporary R&B sound different from the previous three cuts. Jessie J lends her huge vocals on arguably the album's catchiest chorus: \"That's when you remember me \/ I'm the one that had you baby ...\" \"Remember Me\" has an equally potent groove, grounded by an incredibly funky synthetic bass line.\n\n\"Those Who Wait\" sports a low-key vibe on the verses.  Daley vocals are initially hushed and more restrained, but ascend on the inspirational chorus. The theme of the song is about waiting with the culminating message being 'good things come to those who wait'.  The message is simple and 'old school', but the weight is undeniable and Daley conveys it with class and vigor.  What better way to close an sensation EP with a stripped, touching cover of Amy Winehouse's \"Love Is a Losing Game\".\n\nWhat else is there to say? Daley is talented.  He doesn't have to use profanity or be risqu in order to deliver a solid R&B effort. Hopefully Daley's full length album will be as solid and classy as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Alone-Together-EP\/dp\/B009Y6YINQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Alone Together EP<\/a>.

Listening through this double disc of 17 tracks is the closest experience we can get to this Seneca, South Carolina band, save from actually attending one of their concerts.  Here on these discs we get so close enough to hear their stories behind the songs and participate in many sing-along opportunities that you can almost feel the sweat on the furrows of their heads. On the other hand, this is not a haphazard affair where the music sounds like they were recorded over a fan's iPhone.  Rather, what we have here is a polished enough record that doesn't allow the distracting exigencies that normally come with a live recording to dominate.\n\nNEEDTOBREATHE comprises of Bear Rinehart (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Bo Rinehart (backing vocals, guitar), Seth Bolt (backing vocals, bass) and Josh Lovelace (backing vocals, keys).  When they first came upon the scene in 2006 with their debut album \"Daylight,\" they were carefully not to be frivolously designated as yet another rock band.  Rather, utilizing rustic instruments such as banjo and fiddle, they have pioneered a unique subgenre of folk rock, a sound that finds Mumford and Sons meeting Third Day.  Further, their tales of sin, redemption, and grace not only have been embraced by the Christian music community, but they speak with so much realism that they are also revered by many in the secular wing too.  After 5 studio albums with their latest being \"Rivers in the Wasteland,\" \"Live from the Woods\" is their debut live recording.\n\nMost of the songs here are garnered from their studio albums.  But NEEDTOBREATHE doesn't just woodenly reprises their studio performances.  Rather, with a song like \"Something Beautiful,\" the band even pauses so that fans can get their 20 seconds of fame by singing as loudly as possible.  Then on \"Wanted Man\" the additional organ riff is delightful; while \"Feet Don't Fail Me Now\" actually sounds better live than in the studio.  While the original version (from \"Rivers in the Wasteland\") has an Auto-voicing computerized gloss, here the live version has a rough-hewed Traveling Wilburys rock n' roll immediacy to it.  \"Devil's Been Talkin'\" with the prominence of banjo sounds more Americana-country than rock.\n\nYet, what makes NEEDTOBREATHE's albums indispensable are the spiritual depths of their songs.  Most heart-wrenching is \"More Heart Less Attack,\" an ode to the church to love more rather than biting each other's tails at the slightest slur.  In a culture of increasing social isolation, \"Brother\" rids relationships of all its dividing scaffolds.  Faith has not been more eloquently put than \"Difference Maker:\" \"Isn't it amazing how God can take a broken man, and let him find a fortune and then ruin it with his own two hands, and he climbs on up the hill on the Rock on which he stands, He looks back at the crowd he looks down at his hands and he says I am a Difference Maker, I am the only one who speaks to Him, and I am the friendliest of friends of God.\"\n\nBonfires are often the most relaxing as well as the most revealing times.  When we feel the warmth not just of the fire but from the people around us, we start to melt down our defences.  And in many ways, this is what \"Live from the Woods\" is like.  It breaks down our defences that we can start hearing from God and others again without inhibitions.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Artists and bands like Badly Drawn Boy, Coldplay, Turin Brakes, and Travis are embracing folk music and incorporating it with pop and rock. Kings of Convience is the next band to come out with a cd filled with melodic folk\/rock. A lot of reviewers has compared this band with the late artist Nick Drake which I can totally hear through out the entire cd.\nTo be perfectly honest, I really don't know what to make of this album so far. I have only listened to it twice. Compared to Turin Brakes, I much prefer Turin Brakes over Kings of Convience. I found this cd a bit too mellow for my tastes.

{"text":"It has been a very long wait since Amel returned to the studio and completed her new neo-soul collection of songs. The downside is if you hesitated even 10 days, you may have missed a chance to own a physical CD copy. It looks like this will be a digital album only moving forward. Though the majority of my music listening is now near exclusively on my iPod, I have converted to the digital space. But artists such as Amel makes me want a physical CD with a CD booklet and a tangible, tactical look at the Ruven Afanador album cover.\nThe most important element is the content, the music. Several songs like \"Orange Glow\" and \"Afraid\" have been released as single\/digital downloads.\nThis is possibly her most ethereal work as it seamless floats through millions of emotive designs like say a movie like \"Cloud Atlas\". It has so many layers that you know it will be revealing itself for many months of intimate listenings. \"Danger 2\" ends the album and probably best signifies how intangible, but, deeply affecting work Amel has created. The acoustic guitar in the last 30-45 seconds reflects the beautiful journey you have been on through its 16 tracks.\nWhere \"Infinite Possibilities\" tried to incorporate the more radio friendly side of Ms. Larrieux. \"Get Up\" almost told you that this was no Top 40 entry aiming to capture Groove Theory's audience. If you didn't understand the doors \"Get Up\" was leaning against.....then most assuredly \"Ice Cream Everyday\" will confound you and immediately reject your application into the world of Amel Larrieux.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I have grown so weary of people dissecting this album for flaws, repetitive beats, retro-ness, and the like.  And I am especially sick and tired of people confusing this amazing artist's life with her art. Is Van Gogh's work any less important, or is it in any sense less amazing, because he had such bad emotional problems that he cut off his ear and shot himself in the chest twice--killing himself at 36?  NO, NO, NO!\n\nI don't care how the artist, producers, button pushers, chalkboard scrapers, or anyone else involved in the making of the recording achieved the sound when it is this amazing.  In my estimation, what really matters at the end of the day, is the way an album sounds, and this one is off the charts!\n\nThe songs on this album run the gamut from suicidal to exhilarated, playful to provocative, old school to new school, fawning to tempting, without ever skipping a beat.  And then there is that voice--like Etta James, Billie Holliday, Bettye LaVette, and all The Supremes rolled into one beautiful ear candy confection---chased with a shot of tequila.  And did I mention that she has the swagger and in-your-face attitude of another uniquely original artist--Madonna. I realize they are worlds apart musically, but the presence and panache that they both exhibit are what makes me draw the parallel. For better or worse, Amy has the f-you attitude that Madonna had when she was starting out.  Say what you will about this woman, but there is no one else like her, and this album proves it in spades!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I listen to a wide range of music, and often I don't realize that a particular song I enjoy isn't a modern release until I look up more information about it online.  I frequently heard John \"Cougar\" Mellencamp's \"Jack and Diane\" on a \"lite\" radio station in the 2000s, but always thought it was a recent release -- it wasn't until recently that I learned it actually came out in the early '80s.  This doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the song, however -- I enjoy older music more than most modern music, and '80s music especially.  And this particular song is a fun and thoughtful one, upbeat but with lyrics that anyone can appreciate.\n\nA mellower rock song with electric and acoustic guitars as the main instruments (the drums are more subdued up until the bridge), this song showcases the titular teens as the main characters -- two kids growing up in a small town in America's heartland, entertaining dreams of the future and enjoying each other's company.  Even as they make big plans for the future, the chorus and the bridge counsel them to hang onto their youth as long as they can, because everyone grows up eventually, and there's no returning to the days of your youth.  After all \"life goes on, long after the thrill of living is done.\"\n\nWhether or not you agree with that sentiment (there's still the old adages of \"age is only a number\" and \"growing old is mandatory, growing up is optional,\" after all), this is still a powerful song, sort of a grown-up version of Kenny Loggins' \"Return to Pooh Corner.\"  While the singer of the former longs for a return to the days of childhood, John Mellencamp seems content to reminisce on the teenage years, and accepts that they won't come back and it's best to enjoy them as long as you can.\n\nA very enjoyable rock number, one that transcends its era and is timely even to modern audiences.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"It's like this baby: Metallica helped define thrash metal in the 80s. With Kill 'Em All, they proved that they could play hard, fast, and with reams of energy. However, the subsequent release of Ride The Lightning proved to be a more thought-out collection of songs. Hetfield's peerless riffing is more refined, and his growling vocals are coming along (he still wasn't too great, though). Hammett's solos are mostly exciting, and he became one of the most copied lead guitarists around (in metal). Even Ulrich, whose drumming was always relatively simple, fits well with the music is gives it a crushing edge. Metallica has never been too focused on bass, so I feel sorry for Cliff Burton he doesn't really get too much attention. He still plays an important role in adding extra punch to the riffs, but one thing that's nice about Metallica's newer work is that the production is more accommodating to the different instruments. (Just a small gripe.)\nAnyway, this album tells you what Metallica was all about. The highlight of Ride the Lighting one of my favorite Metallica songs, \"Fade to Black.\" It's a great anti-suicide song, that starts with slow, lugubrious guitar that builds up into heavy, powerful riffs. It concludes with exhilarating, punchy riffs and a glistening solo. Fans have written to Metallica saying that this song deterred them from taking the course of suicide...that's how good it is!\n\"Call of Ktulu\", the big instrumental, is almost symphonic in its interplay (which is why it works so well with the orchestra on S&M). \"Creeping Death\" and \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" are heavy, clomping thrash songs with interesting progressions and killer riffs. \"Fire Fire with Fire\" is mindless thrash with lots of kick. \"Trapped under Ice\" is tight speed metal.\nRide the Lightning isn't as ambitious or complex as Metallica's follow-ups, Master of Puppets or ...And Justice For All. However, most of the songs are great one way or another. Here, Metallica driven by pure intensity and delivers a great, great metal album.","classification":4,"fold":7}
{"text":"Please keep in mind that, even though I was a teenager when this album came out (or about to become one, rather) I never got into grunge at all.  Even as my friends were playing the albums, I just found the music to be an attempt to rock out, only to normally have weak songwriting and nothing memorable about the music to really help me understand why the genre became so popular.  All the bands sounded the same to me.\n\nHowever, Nevermind was really different from all the other ones.  It was angrier, and the lyrics were backed up with simple and interesting musical ideas.  Sure, all the songs on Nevermind sound almost identical to each other, with only minor changes in tempo and slight variations on the way the songs are written.  BUT, I happen to like this idea.\n\nI went five whole years without listening to this album, so the other day, in April of 2007, when I finally took it off the shelf and popped it into the CD player (well, DVD player) I was really surprised that the songwriting has really stood the test of time.  The songs that were enjoyable 15 years ago are still enjoyable today.\n\nSure, you could argue that many of the songs have been played WAY too much through the years and are probably worn out, but to me, these songs are still fresh and exciting.  You will recognize every song.  It's not like you can forget them- they're all really catchy.  Very good songwriting overall.\n\nI still love the \"yeah yeah\" section of \"lithium\" and \"something in the way\" is such a scary way to close out an album.  Scary because it ends on such an unusual note.  \"smells like teen spirit\" remains a classic, as does the rest of the album.  This album should be in every rock or grunge fans collection.","classification":5,"fold":7}

For those of you not familiar with it, Billy Jack was a renegade hero of the marginalized Indians (now Native Americans) on reservations.

{"text":"To put in perspective where this Pink Floyd fan is coming from, my first album bought was Obscured By Couds as a new release. I then bought Ummagumma, Atom Heart Mother, Meddle, and the Syd Barrett re-releases of Saucerful and Piper (which I later sold because, I never ever did see his \"genius\", just as one more Crazy Diamond). Then came DSOTM and I have always hated the song Money, but liked most of the album except for all the alarms. Eventually, the very cynical Animals became my all time favorite and I liked them all the way up to Division Bell. I liked The Wall and The Final Cut, but felt that these were just absolutely brilliant lyrical venting on Roger's part, which had all of us paying fans acting as his psychiatric couch. Must be nice, which is why I welcomed Momentary Lapse Of Reason and still love that one.\n\nSo, I got really psyched up when I found out about this release and researched it until I could find leaked You Tube songs. The first ones that I heard really threw me for a loop and I got prepared for a nasty one star review calling it the soundtrack for old hippies in nursing homes. Worse than that, I was going to call it Nick Mason's last attempt at milking the udders from the cow on Atom Heart Mother for all it's worth. Instead, it is none of these nasty descriptions. What made me change my mind? I watched Anisina on You Tube and got some 5-star goose bumps. However, the only other cut that rises to this level is Surfacing.\n\nSo, just like the teenager from 40 years ago who also still does not trust the Post Office to lose his stuff, I went out and bought it locally today. I was not about to wait one more week to hear this one! The verdict: the ones that sound anything at all like Pink Floyd are few and far between on this already short album. The winners are by track number: 2, 4, 7, 11, 13, 17. Track number 5 will not make it to my iPod as it is a soundtrack for a bad trip (eventhough no one has time for that kind of thing anymore). Track number 18 is the only one with vocals and also will not make it to my iPod because the opening line sums up the part that I have hated about this band airing out their dirty laundry, \"We bitch and we fight\". Speaking of which, does anyone else notice that mainly British bands fight amongst themselves, hold grudges for years, and are also obsessed with lunacy? Get over it and give us some more good music!!!!\n\nThe 6 out of 18 cuts mentioned make for a worthwhile purchase, with Anisina being worth the price all by itself. An instant clasic cut! For those who want further clarification, I would call this genre as \"Instrumental Soundtrack\", but definitely not \"Progressive Psychedelic\", as all of their previous albums were. Do yourself a favor and check out the full videos from the tracks that I mentioned, and then decide if you want this one as a keeper. Not for everyone, but this is certainly\nno frisbee.","classification":3,"fold":7}

The 5 new songs are fantastic, and will leave you begging for a new album from Lorrie. \"To Get To You\" is a beautiful power ballad, where you can feel the emotion and passion that Lorrie puts into every note. Definately my favorite of the new songs. Lorrie does a remake of \"Another Lonely Song\"  which shows off Lorrie's traditional country voice, a tribute to Tammy Wynette, as only Lorrie could cover a song by the late country diva. \"If I Cry\" is another emotional ballad that will leave you breathless, she sings with so much passion and emotion. \"Whoop-De-Do\" is an upbeat song, a bit of a departure from her usual music, but its fun and you can tell she enjoyed doing it. \"Angel\" is Lorrie's cover of the Sarah McLaughlin hit, she does it just as well, this one is a live track that will make you want to cry.\nThe hits on this album are We Both Walk, Half Enough, By My Side (with Jon Randall), Good As I Was To You, Go Away, One Of Those Nights Tonight, Maybe Not Tonight (with Sammy Kershaw), I Guess I Had to Be There, Trainwreck of Emotion, Standing Tall, He Talks to Me and the classic Something in Red.

{"text":"Haha. It's so funny. I love the vibe of the song, and I get some of the lyrics but it's been a long time since I've actually looked in the book.\n\nI still don't understand what he's saying in the pre-chorus...\n\nda da da da da da da da da da da da\nda da ...da da da da da da da da da da...\n..etc, etc.\n\nand then the chorus,\n\n\"Dance, Dance. We're falling apart to half time.\"\n\"Dance, Dance. And these are the lies...you love to lead!\"\n\"Dance! This is the way we...?\" \"...Dance! Misery loves me...\"\n\nYes, I'm far behind. But even in Sugar, We're Going Down you need to look at the book for some guidance. :)\n\nAnyway, the words that I do understand I like. And although not many people will see this, I had to put in my word because this song was my favorite Fall Out song ever. For a while.\n\nI like the riffs, although uncomplicated, they suit the song. Especially the ones right before the last, \"Dance, Dance...We're fallin' apart to half time.\" They are a bit harder.\n\nNearly everything about this particular song; the understandable lyrics, the drums and the simple initial guitar chords make it a pop sensation in my opinion. Irresistibly-catchy or irresistibly-terrible; Which side are you on?\n\nThis is March 2008 and this song came out in 2005 some time. 3 years from now I didn't necessarily see myself still listening to and liking this song. But it's still getting play on my mp3...\n\n4.5 stars.\n\nEnd Note: If you like this song, download Golden (much slower, and much more real) or The (After) Life Of The Party, their best song ever.

{"text":"Recently I tried to think of as many bands as I could that if they were to make a new album or come to town with a show, how many would contain the groups original lineup.  The answer was almost none. So I came to the conclusion that the only real way to judge a new release was to be not too concerned about the current lineup and also not to obsess about whether what the band is currently doing sounds exactly like something they may have done 30 years ago!  I grew up listening to Yes in the 70's and saw them in 1972 and then again in 2004 (both times original line-up both times great)\nI will always love Yes 70's output through \"Going for the One\". I really haven't been blown away by anything they have put out since, except maybe Drama and some of Keys to Ascension.  But I'm glad they have continued because they are still phenomenal live and each record has moments of great Yes music.\nI had no idea Yes was working on a new record and when I heard about it I was not expecting much.  I feel as though on records like \"The Ladder\" and \"Magnification\" Jon has gone from being a visionary to unfortunately a singer of bland New Age sentiments.  Not awful but kind of weak in my opinion.  I actually heard part of Fly from Here before I even knew that Jon was no longer in the band.\nSo now I have heard FFH 4 times and I am somewhat surprised and cautiously hopeful for this one.  There is I guess nothing wrong with judging a piece of art a few days after it has been released but it is a fact that time will be the real judge here.  Somethings rise while others fall with the passing of time.\nMy first impression of FFH is that it is a proper Yes album.  It has a 20 minute epic, a Steve Howe solo guitar piece and the right kind of album artwork.  And I am thrilled to say that it sounds like an old school Prog Album!!! However, it doesn't sound exactly like an old school Yes Prog album.  But, at least in my opinion this is an interesting development.  I'm hearing hints of King Crimson, Pink Floyd, Kansas, Asia, along with Drama era no Jon Anderson in the music and since none of those groups are really doing this any more it may not be a bad idea for Yes to carry the Prog torch since in my mind they are the best at it anyway.  FFH may be a bit too MOR but at least so far all the music seems a good representation of this sound\/style.  The music is very uplifting without being sappy and too new agey.\nApparently Benoit David was involved in a Yes tribute band and at times he sounds just like Jon singing.  I can't help but think that the injection of young blood has been really good for this new Yes record.  He does not drop the ball once, during the whole of the record and I think he deserves a lot of praise for this and maybe for fans of Yes music a new Star has been born. Two thumbs UP!!!","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"\"Saturate Before Using\", \"Late For The Sky\" and this album (and I suppose \"Runnin' On Empty\" too although I've yet to hear it - I can't imagine it would be bad, though) are ESSENTIAL albums to ANY music fan. EVERYTHING about these albums is perfect - the production, lyrics, musicianship, singing...etc. This makes perfect sense as Jackson was notoriously worried about getting everything perfect in the studio (and his producers rightfully got annoyed at him for that). This paid off in spades, however, as everything is crystal clear and perfect even though this was recorded in the late 60's! A cool little addition is that the first and second as well as the 9th and 10th songs flow into one another (very cool). The lyrics, as always, are extremely quotable, deep and meaningful - pretty much second only to Bob Dylan. Unlike Dylan, though, the lyrics are, like title of the album, \"For Everyman\". As opposed to \"Saturate Before Using\" and \"Late For The Sky\", \"For Everyman\" is the more consistent album - there aren't any \"bad\" songs (not that the other two had bad songs, a bunch just weren't as good as the highlights). Another cool addition is the first track, \"Take It Easy\", which is the original song which The Eagles then made into a monster hit with their cover version. If you were unsure whether you liked Jackson before, buy this album and you'll become a fan! For $9.00 this is a STEAL! Absolutely recommended!\n\nHighlights include:\nthe entire album!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Although it definately had it's great moments Charlie Wilson's previous solo album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Uncle-Charlie\/dp\/B001P4OACE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Uncle Charlie<\/a>&nbsp;not only suffered from too many cases of overproduction but lack of direction as well,concentrating a little too much on being musically modern than on well constructed songs and grooves. This follow up really does an excellent job at making up for that. Charlie has gone out of his way to make his solo music very distinctive and,as with everything he's done no one is going to mistake this for a Gap Band album from the early 80's. Basically this is an album consisting of midtempo jams that use a lot of modern flourishes such as slippery beats and chanted vocal choruses. But all the same there's still a lot of the unique creative flavors that defines Charlie Wilson. True his voice has weathered to a degree with age but on songs such as \"My Girl Is A Dime\",\"You Are\",\"Once And Forever\",\"I Can't Let Go\",\"Where Would I\" and \"Lotto\" both the modern spirit of music and his own musical flavors shine through at the same time,something he didn't quite get to with his previous album. It's on the uptempo songs that the improvement is even more marked. On the twinkling funk\/dance of \"Never Got Enough\" and to a somewhat lesser degree \"Life Of The Party\" and the stop-n-start \"Crying For You\"  Charlie manages to make faster music that is both true to the 70's\/80's disco and funk scene from which he came but is also true all the same to the somewhat more high tech revial of that music taking place in the here and now. So not only are the grooves strong and make you want to dance and enjoy yourself but it seems to lift his own spirit that he no longer feels he has to stop being true to himself musically to be successful. Sitting in the middle of that road is a faithful cover of Roger Troutman's \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" featuring Fantasia in a powerful vocal duet. As the previous reviewer pointed out this album is free of rap\/hip-hop guests and influences but that is not really what is important. What is important is how this album establishes Wilson as a contempory artist whose able to cross bridges of generations and changes on the music scene since he began while being true not only to himself but the listener. Overall this album has all the makings of a very positive follow up and I'm looking forward to hearing it when it comes.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"As a radio single, this song was a passing car you had though you saw a million times in the form of Backstreet Boys and the like. But as radio versions usually do, it doesn't give justice to the album version. And like the special edition of The Abyss, some things are better extended.\n\nLike I said, about the first four minutes of the song sound like a boy band reject song. It has good vocals, less than original lyrics and beat, and although it's not as bad as most of the stuff out there, it's kind of a passing song. Easily forgettable.\n\nBut get into the extended portion, and you get more lovely instrumental intrudes, and just general expansion that could be a considered a deleted scene in the movie world. And while it may not be much, it is a nice addition.\n\nOverall, some stuff is better longer, and some stuff can't be short enough. This song is helped by the length, and makes the song sound fuller. Still not totally amazing, but still pretty good. Justin still has a long way to come around before he becomes amazing.

{"text":"Winehouse's second CD, her first released domestically in the US, grabs you by both ears from the opening refrain of \"Rehab.\" Winehouse's gritty voice, backed by a Ray Charles styled electric piano riff and insistent drums are fleshed out by a chorus that moves the song towards Brill Building '60s soul. It's one of those alchemical mixes that recontextualizes familiar elements into something you've simply never heard before. The opener's horns, particularly the low sax and the strings may have be founded in Motown, but they never accompanied a lyric this direct. The effect is wholly new to the ears and the mind.\n\nThe same is true for \"You Know I'm No Good.\" The melody and vocal are Shirley Bassey meets Dinah Washington spy-film soul (made all the more plain by the lyrical callout to Roger Moore), but the production, particularly the bass and drums, sounds like Portishead, and the horns seem to have been lifted from dub reggae. The reggae reference turns up again in the skankin' rhythm of \"Just Friends,\" and girl-group soul heavily influences the album's title track. The original \"Me and Mr. Jones\" swings in a cross of 40s blues and '50s doo wop (think Eartha Kitt), and the dramatic ballad \"Love is a Losing Game\" smoothes things out in an early '70s style.\n\nThe Motown arrangement and production touches return on \"Tears Dry on Their Own,\" but again with a vocal that's more liberated than Detroit ever heard in the '60s. The album finishes out with nods to Stax, the Brill Building, and the sounds of Philadelphia, but all strained through Winehouse's gritty vocals and her producers' breathtaking, sophisticated and organically loose arrangements. Fans of '60s soul, girlgroup sounds, thumping drum-and-bass, and modern stars like Norah Jones and Christina Aguilera should check this one out! 4-1\/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

But when he did a cover song that was out of the ordinary, he not only made it his own nicely, but it sometimes still stands taller than the original artist in that tone. The prime example of Johnny's musical intimacy came nearly at the end of his life when he did a cover of Nice Inch Nails song Hurt. The song is definitely something still worth listening too. Not just from Johnny's voice, but also because of his simplicity of the guitar and piano. It is a great song to listen too, not just if you are a die hard Johnny Cash fan, but also for anyone who is new to his music.

I have every single Bond song in my collection over the years and this and The World Is Not Enough are my favorite modern ones.

{"text":"Mayer proves himself to be master of pretty much any style to which he sets his hand.  Here, he takes on easy 60's influenced country folk\/rock, and he does it as if he were born to that style.  His guitar picking is first rate, simple and direct, always masterful.  His voice is in fantastic form, warmer, huskier than ever, sounding wiser for the life that he has lived.  He is so gifted at the guitar that sometimes we forget what a gifted singer\/interpreter he is, and this gift for melody is in the forefront on this album.  Standouts for me include \"Shadow Days\", with an almost Harrison-esque opening guitar line segueing gently into a piano backed, steel guitar fueled easy groove.  He sings with conviction and beauty, a plea for understanding of a difficult breakup.  \"I'm a good man, with a good hart, had a tough time, had a rough start...but I finally learned to let it go...now I'm right here, and right now, and I'm open, knowing somehow that my shadow days are over now\".  I hope that his shadow days are over; this guy feels real, this feels like a really heartfelt tune, and is an instant favorite for me.  I also love the title track, with it's singalong feel and dense but lovely harmonies--and a divine harmonica.  The album ends with a reprise of the song, and it gives the whole album a completed feel.  \"Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey\" offers more plaintive harmonica over a great piano figure\/guitar harmony, and some inventive chord changes that somehow feel right throughout.  John Mayer has always been good at crafting full albums worth of music--not a lot of filler on most of his albums; this album is just the same, but even more so--there is a sense that this was crafted as a set, each song as a piece unto a whole vision.  I haven't heard a Mayer album that I don't end up enjoying, but in the end, I think that this one has become a real special part of his musical tapestry, and an album that I will return to often and with genuine pleasure.  A long time ago, he said that he wanted to be the kind of guy that his fans will follow over the years as he grows.  I smiled at the time, thinking that he wouldn't really last that long.  I was wrong, and I'm so glad that I was, because this young man has something to say, the skills to say it well, and the heart to make me care.  Unreservedly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":7}

There will likely be a 2 CD set at some point with both of them together as one album, but I bought them separately.  Let me start by saying that anyone that enjoys Progressive Metal should get the entire Vanden Plas catalog.  So now that I established that I am a fan of this group and genre, you can expect this review to be very positive.  Netherworld II has everything that you want in a Progressive Metal release.  Lots of powerful moments, mixed with soft lush moments, and mixed in with stellar musicianship and excellent vocals.  Andy Kuntz delivers another strong vocal performance, and I love the way they are mixing in female vocals to add contrast to some of the songs.  The band has really hit it's stride outputting a signature sound, and I love what I hear from them. Anyone that enjoys concept albums are in for a treat, and should pick up this gem right away.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Halestorm release of their live in Philly 2010 was an amazing show with great engery, passion, desire that they show how much the music means to them while the fans show Lizzy and the band how much their music means to them.  I'll start with their CD performance very good vocals by miss Lizzy Halestorm followed by having the fans sing along with her to the songs.  As the concert continues onward Lizzy tells the people of Philly its good to be home and they got their start in Philly, only drawback though you can tell it's a live concert on two songs Love\/Hate Heartbreak and Nothing to do with Love.  Postive though Lizzy shows their fans that she can do both hard rock songs plus the softer songs between the hard rock songs, one of my favorite songs though by them from the first album was the famililar taste of posion.  Then as concert keeps going we see how much RJ Lizzy's brother has so much passion for playing the drums,  to me Lizzy has the most haunting vocals ever for a singer and proves it over and over again on mutiple songs.  So out of 12 songs on the CD only 2 had feedback.  As for the DVD amazing show and you can see how much rock music means to Lizzy and the rest of the band as they rock out in front of their fans,  added bonus when you buy this CD\/DVD combo you get 4 music videos to watch along with the concert.  In closing only took one star off because of those two songs with feedback and on the DVD seem to have two edited parts, what I mean is they had an extra song on the DVD that wasn't on the CD and second when she talks about coming home to Philly and the bands touring with them you don't hear her say they got their start here in Philly on the DVD.  But I enjoyed both the CD and DVD lots and I am sure if you buy this CD\/DVD combo you will enjoy it as much as I did by just taking a chance on a live concert of a band I am sure you love listening to as much as I do.","classification":4,"fold":7}

Not long before, in 1995 she released GREATEST HITS, but this offers a more comprehensive collection of her songs, from that album, and from the hits that came after that. As well there are 5 new songs worth raving about. Starting with the tongue-in-cheek \"Whoop-de-do\", a song with plenty of attitude, its a fun song and nice to see this side of Lorrie. Then there is the beautiful, love and devotion ballad \"To Get To You\" which Lorrie just masters with her impecable vocals. \"If I Cry\" is another power ballad, and could have been a big hit if given a chance. She also covers the Sarah McLaughlan song \"Angel\", and gives her own magic to this touching song. Perhaps one of the most talked about tracks is the Tammy Wynette cover of \"Another Lonely Song\", which Lorrie does justice to very well! Also includes her hits such as \"Good As I Was To You\", \"One Of Those Nights Tonight\", \"Go Away\", \"Something In Red\", \"Maybe Not Tonight\" With Sammy Kershaw, and plenty of others.

It has sold approx. 400,000 copies in the U.S. and about 600,000 worldwide. The album peaked at #63 on the Pop Charts and #6 on the R&B charts. They do have a few standout tracks, such as \"Young Love\" and \"Come & Give Your Love To Me\". Those were the first two singles but barley cracking the charts.

{"text":"Many have compared the Canadian Tenors with Il Divo. The comparison is very easy to make. 4 powerful singers who sing pseudo-opera (popera) music while milking the pop element of their music with lush arrangements. Music is a question of personal taste, so it seems silly to compare the two groups. Both are talented and have some stunning tracks which showcase their voices. I can only state my preference in this review.\n\nThe Il Divo Christmas CD did not live up to my expectations. It was overproduced and oversung and had some bizarre song choices (Somewhere over the Rainbow?). It is, in my opinion, their worst effort to date. The Canadian Tenors do not make these same mistakes with this CD. They have an interesting yet relevant mix of songs. (even the previously-released \"Hallelujah\" and \"The Prayer\" fit in here). Classics (O Holy Night, God Rest ye Merry Gentlemen, Silent Night) mixed with interesting unique songs (Huron Carol, Wintersong, etc) make this CD an amazing listening experience. Their voices are soft and gentle when need be, and powerful and convincing when needed. The arrangements are unique and memorable. So, for me, this CD is much better than Il Divo's holiday CD.\n\nI hope you enjoy this CD during the holiday season! I will listen to certain tracks all year long. It is stunningly beautiful. \"Wintersong\" with Sarah Maclachlan is an ethereal, melancholic song that transports you to another world. It is my favorite track of the CD, but for me, there is not one single dud. I look forward to other releases by The Canadian Tenors!","classification":5,"fold":7}

Some of the songs are memorable, especially the title track, \"Boxcar Racer\", and \"Every Ship Must Sail Away\".  And the instrumentation is at times gorgeous, with excellent fiddle and mandolin work; in fact, that's when the band really shines.  Steven Harris' production defintiely leaves some Dave-Matthewisan footprints, and that's fine with me, too.  So what's the problem?  The CD as a whole just doesn't excite me - much of it has a pleasant familiarity and all the excitement of Keane's debut (in other words, capable but not artistically challenging).  I'm still waiting for a new band this year that will knock my socks off, and these guys only gave my socks a gentle tug.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"John Legend's new CD \"Evolver\" does as it says on the tin. It showcases the singer's evolution with him raising the tempo on his songs (the sunny upbeat Lead-off single \"Green light\" with Andre 3000 and a two step beat) and even exploring Reggae (the tender Lovers Rock of \"No other love\" featuring his UK protege Estelle, and the bonus track \"Can't be my lover\").\n\nOther upbeat numbers include the dance song \"It's over\" (featuring his buddy Kanye west), \"Quickly\" featuring Brandy, \"Satisfaction\", and the African-tinged inspirational \"If you're there\". Legend said of this album that it doesn't sound like him, and going by these afore mentioned songs, he's right.\n\nNo fear if you're a fan of the softer, more sentimental Mr Legend, there's ballads a-plenty; \"Everybody knows\", \"Cross the line\" (with booming bass), the piano ballad \"This time\" (very \"Ordinary people\" and featuring a soaring vocal performance), \"Take me away\" (Jazzy with lilting percussion), \"Good morning\", and the spare acoustic \"I love, you love\" (what a vocal performance).\n\nAnother winner from the Legend.","classification":5,"fold":7}
{"text":"Firstly - the combination of Ms LaVette and Craig Street works well - the vibe between the band and the singer is great and the recording is superb. The 'fast' version of \"Dirty Old Town\" and \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\" are wonderful sublime, soul outings - after these, the rest of the album pales in comparison. It is by no means less than okay - I just did not appreciate some of the selections e.g., the title track. But the album stays with you - listening to it a couple of times - especially the track \"Yesterday Is Here\" - I heard shades of Alberta Hunter's Cookery albums - great praise and perhaps a new direction for Ms. LaVette - not bad at 67!  Listening to \"Dirty Old Town\" and the rumbling guitar track brought back the feel of Memphis and had personally had me wishing that the album had the same feel throughout and wondering what would happen if Ms LaVette teamed up with Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham, Allen Toussaint or Dr. John.  This one track is worth 4 stars.","classification":4,"fold":7}

He made me think of it so often I finally looked for the song and was so surprised and delighted to find it. Brings so much laughter into my small life. I am almost a shut in with the occasional disabled bus trip to doctors or to purchase something necessary I cannot get online at a reasonable (cheap or reduced cost) price. We all need to do whatever we can to bring laughter and whatever joy we can find into our lives, no matter how limited we are. This always makes me laugh and is a treasure to hear now. I never cared much for it when I was young but really appreciate the humor since I relate it to my friend. He likes to be the only one to talk (I don't mind a bit) so even if I try to insert a comment of agreement he will protest I don't allow him to finish a sentence, LOL.

{"text":"A little past the due date, this review serves to put the spotlight back on a shining beacon of an album, March On Washington. Released in October 2014 by hip hop trio Diamond District (producer Oddisee and emcees yU and Uptown XO) under Mello Music Group, March On Washington just might be the perfect album to reserve for February, Black History Month, to review. Although it doesn't explicitly make race an issue, this crystalline-bright LP, inspired by the event during which Martin Luther King Jr. made his famous I Have A Dream speech, has a sense of vigor and urgency that mimic the 1963 civil rights gathering which it is named after. When the three artists on the album wear their Black pride on their sleeves however, they do so with a good measure of modesty. Boiled down, March On Washington is simply amazing music for all people, irrespective of skin tone. You could listen to this beautiful album a dozen times and still need more plays to capture and appreciate all the gifts it intends to bestow upon its listeners. It's that good.\n\nOddisee, yU and XO hail from the Washington DC area, or the DMV (DC, Maryland and Virginia) as some call it. They're not shy about representing their area with pride, but they're also not obsessed with the practice either thankfully. March On Washington is basically a clarion call to live healthfully. The album's wisdom easily takes the cake, and this wisdom is not the boring, snooze-inducing type but the cool, useful, knowledge-based sort aided of course by a preponderance of superlative rap flows by yU and XO. Each stanza flourishes with excellent lyrical rhymes and undisturbed thoughts on everyday life. Areas explored include the differences among people, critique of the mainstream and lots of bubbly, effervescent proverbs. Diamond District wish to share their preternatural skill, talent and ways of thinking, and the richness and captivating nature of March On Washington prove the group's success to this end. The album is smart but also fun, never losing its lyrical weightiness. The ride is smooth yet hypnotic, as everything rests comfortably on Oddisee's soul-drenched samples and crisp drum set beats. Look out for a few surprises like \"Working Weekends\"' squeaky, chirpy alt. sounds. The variety they provide will come in handy.\n\nAlthough only their second album as a group following 2009's In The Ruff, Diamond District have the hip hop heart and substance to make them instant breakout hit makers. Each of the three members are proving themselves singly with outside projects, but together they might be even more special. March On Washington is exciting and philosophical, with lots of slow-bopping replay value that is street tested and boom-bap approved.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"The Good\n\nOn disc one, the group starts their tale with the multi-tempo epic \"The King for a 1000 Years\". Clocking in a nearly fourteen minutes, this track takes you on a journey of driving riffs, fiery solos, melodic vocals, and pounding drums. Although not as lengthy, the same can be said for the bass heavy \"The Invisible Man\" and the guitar solo laden \"Born on Judgment Day\" \"Mrs. God\", despite its catchy chorus, comes off more as a pop-rock song than a power metal tune. Disc two is where things start to go downhill (see below), but still manages to pull out a few good songs. There are some monster riffs on \"Do You Know What You're Fighting For\" and some virtuoso solo work courtesy of Michael Weikath and Sascha Gerstner. \"Get It Up\" charges along muscle car barreling down the race track.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThere is no reason that both discs couldn't fit on one. What happened to their trademark frantic twin guitar attacks? There are a few here and there, but for the most part they're limited. The choruses can be catchy, but they're not as over-the-top as past Helloween songs. \"Occasion Avenue\" is another epic that starts off disc two. The intro in made up of someone tuning through radio stations that are player various songs from the original Keeper albums. I thought that was pretty lame. Let \"Light the Universe\" be a lesson to any power metal band that's thinking of a duet ballad...don't do it. Candice Night of Blackmore's Knight handles vocals. While the vocal performances by Candice and Andi are great, the presentation is not indicative of the genre or the band.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nI've always enjoyed the Europeam metal scene. Just look at my older reviews for Helloween, Gamma Ray, and the like. That's why it pains me to write this. The biggest thing that irks me about Helloween as of late is their complete lack of consistency. Ever since they lost Kiske and Hansen they've tried everything they can to stay relevant; trying to sound darker, trying to sound like themselves, and now trying to recapture the grandeur that Keeper of the Seven Keys I & II brought them. Sorry guys, it was a totally different band and a totally different musical time period.\n\nThey're a few songs on The Legacy that capture the sound and magic that was Keeper of the Seven Keys, but for the most part the story is weak and the band switches from their power metal sound to sounding like a standard hard\/rock metal band way too much for my tastes. Helloween try to recapture what made them great by revisiting the albums and themes that helped them break out, but somehow manage to stomp all over the legend that was The Keeper of the Seven Keys in the process. The album reeks of desperation, but manages to pack 50% worth of decent material.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"I really like Josh Groban, even if his style of music isn't one I normally listen to.  He has a gorgeous voice that's capable of bringing tears to my eyes, and his songs are beautiful.  And he has a fun and goofy personality when he's not performing -- just look at his Facebook page sometime.  And as a fan of Broadway, I was super-excited to hear about his \"Stages\" album.  Groban and musicals?  What wasn't to love?\n\nAs it turns out, Groban and Broadway might not mix as well as I thought.  This isn't a BAD album by any means... but it certainly isn't his best, nor is it the best compilation of songs from Broadway musicals.\n\nGroban covers a nice selection of songs here, including numbers from some of the most famous musicals out there -- \"Les Miserables,\" \"Phantom of the Opera,\" \"Chorus Line,\" \"Into the Woods,\" and others.  There are also some numbers from movies (\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" and \"Wizard of Oz\"), which sort of goes against the title and theme of the album, but then, these songs might be present in stage adaptations of the movies, so perhaps they fit anyhow.  There are also numbers from plays that aren't quite as popular but are still worth noting, such as \"Chess\" and \"Sunday in the Park with George.\"\n\nGroban's voice is stunning as always... but I do agree with other reviewers that this album sounds overproduced.  Sometimes simplicity is best, and Groban's voice is beautiful enough to stand on its own without a lot of musical embellishment.  There are times in this album where the orchestra threatens to overwhelm Groban's voice, and that's a shame.  I know instruments are just as important to a song as vocals, but here I think the musical accompaniment should be just that -- an accompaniment, something to compliment the singer and not compete with it.\n\nAlso, some of these songs feel empty when taken out of context -- when they're sung by an actor who has immersed him or herself in a role and has a great handle on the character, we feel that emotion carry through into the song.  The songs often don't work as well when taken out of the context of the musical and are sung by someone with little appreciation for the character behind them.  A good musical has songs that fit the story instead of just being great stand-alone numbers, and sadly that's a weakness that hurts this album -- many of these songs just aren't as powerful excised from their original context.\n\nThis is still a beautiful album, and good if you're a Groban completionist.  But it's one of his weaker albums in my opinion, and the songs feel odd out of context.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"There is honestly no question about Whitney Houston's return to the spotlight. With her album I Look To You debuting at #1 on Billboard, and selling 300,000 copies the opening week, there is no doubt about it that she is back in harmony and soulfully. That has shown very well on the intimate songs on I Look To You, including I Didn't Know My Own Strength, which Whitney performed on The Oprah Winfrey show, that brought the house down. The song is a very simple and intimate ballad that Diane Warren brilliantly wrote for Whitney, reflecting signs of going through the blue period, and coming into the light. It is honestly the most personal song Diane had wrote for Whitney since You'll Never Stand Alone from My Love Is Your Love, that really strikes you deeply in the heart. It also was the 2nd song that got leaked out online way in advance before I Look To You was released. If you haven't downloaded the record, than I really suggest you download the song, and feel the soul of Whitney's strength.\n\nSong: A 1\/2-","classification":5,"fold":7}

The song which finally is available for downloading for your music library is still just a pop delight after all these years. The song definitely is one of those songs that ca really get you in the soul of the heart.

The groove is tight, but my lack of expertise with his music is nothing against him. I think at the time he popped up on the scene, smooth jazz became, at it still is, my mainstay. That is not to say I do not possess a lack of R&B music; the 70s, 80s & 90s, oh, I'll beat you down with my collection. Those are my eras of music and I have decidedly found that much has not gotten better since that passage of time. But I am sincerely glad my wife found out this is Jon B, and dude really does his craft well. I've never stepped foot inside of a club, except on the jazz scene, where both Jeff Lorber and Eric Marienthal stood right beside me while being introduced. I looked over, smiled in amazement and they both shook my hand. 1996, Atlantic Beer & Ice, Charlotte, NC.

{"text":"Type O Negative definitely sped up their music a notch. their early work, up to October Rust, was slow and heavy, but they have gotten heavier over time. to me, it sounds like they mixed a little Danzig into their music. somewhere, it was said that they were influenced by Sisters of Mercy and Bauhaus. evidently, they are also influenced by Black Sabbath and Danzig as well, the 1st and second songs are faster than previous works, and Peter Steele's baritone voice is replaced by the band's melodic singing. on song no. 3, Peter adapts a hardcore voice at first, and then his signature baritone voice is on and off. he must have been reading the Bible, because the song is about the Apocalypse. one minor complaint is that the lyrics are hard to read, but they make up for it with excellent musicianship. this album is hour and 17 minutes long and the third song alone is 10 minutes long. this is an interesting listen.","classification":5,"fold":7}

The guitar riffs and more are awesome; they also fit in perfectly with those sizzling lyrics and the overall result is very powerful.\n\nThis is one song I won't ever forget.

I enjoyed the singing voice, but honestly, the entire piece just got too loud for me and took me right out of the mood that it started with.

{"text":"I wasn't aware we had acquired this until asked to review it and just listened to it.  Despite some good lines in the lyrics, the instrumentation is often shrill and discordant.  It wasn't as bad as chalk screeching on the blackboard, but it is not something I would have deliberately.  The singers have good voices, and if I were more curious, I might try to find out why they chose to use the instruments the way they did.  To be fair, I do know people that would enjoy this, they like \"experimental\" music, but for me, it was like listening to the kind of jazz or classical music that only real aficionados can appreciate, where the nuances and subtleties go beyond the individual skills and into a realm of appreciation I simply lack.  I dislike reviewing music because tastes are so individual and I suggest  what I suggest to folks I take to a new restaurant.  Taste it, if you don't like it, don't finish it.  But I listened to the whole song.  If you know these folks, you probably already like them, if you don't, hit the 30 second sampler or go to youtube and listen to a video.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  I gained the knowledge that Honest Face wasn't my kind of song, but I may give Finn and Jane another listen on their other songs before I make a decision on them.","classification":2,"fold":7}

{"text":"Lights is the one (wo)man band of Valerie Poxleitner. In 2011, Lights released an outstanding second album called \"Siberia\". Last year we got a (belated) companion album to that called \"Siberia Acoustic\" which for me was somewhat of a head scratcher. But now comes the long awaited next 'regular' studio album.\n\n\"Little Machines\" (11 tracks; 38 min.) starts off with an introvert \"Portal\", as if we were dropping in mid-way into the album. Very strange that this is the opening track. Things immediately get better after that, with the upbeat \"Running With the Boys\", with the irresistible chorus \"So turn up the noise\/Dressed to the nines\/Running with the boys\/Your hand in mine\". \"Up We Go\" is in the same vein. What is clear is that the overall sound is a bit less heavy than on \"Siberia\", and a few times also less dependent on the keyboards and synthesizers. Side A concludes with \"Speeding\", in fact a mid-tempo semi-ballad of sorts. \"Muscle Memory\" is another highlight (starting off Side B), one of the better 'pop' tunes on here, with a great melody. \"Slow Down\" speaks for itself. \"How We Do It\" is the last true highlight on here, a blast, driven by up-tempo synth. The album closes nicely with Lights pleading \"Don't Go Home Without Me\". Bottom line: other than the strange way in which this album opens, this is another fine album from Lights, although for now I still like \"Siberia\" a little better. (There is also a \"deluxe\" version of \"Little Machines\", which brings another 3 songs.)\n\nI had the good fortune of seeing Lights in concert (when they are a foursome, including a live drummer) two years ago at the Bunbury Music Festival here in Cincinnati, and live it all sounded pretty massive. Lights commented to the crowd that \"I'm pretty sure that you'll see more synthesizers here than with any other band on the festival\" and right she was! Can't wait to see Lights in concert again at some point to see how the songs from \"Little Machines\" resonate in a live setting.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"On \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\" 50 was a new fledgling rapper with a new major label, and he had something to prove. He showed everybody who he was, a tough rapper from Queens, and he actually had something to say. His only beef here was with Ja Rule, and that was actually pretty entertaining, especially since now 50 makes a beef with every rapper he lays eyes on. He gets some good production and guest appearances from Eminem, Nate Dogg, and the G Unit family. I hope 50 can be remembered for this album rather than for the Massacre, which is terrible, and whatever else he makes from this point on.\n\nPretty much all the tracks here are good to listen to. He really sounds tough here, not all worried about women and his star status like he would be later. \"What Up Gangsta\" is good, good chants at the end and all. \"Patiently Waiting\" with Eminem is memorable, crazy production, good lyrics by both parties. \"Many Men\" was a hit, 50 telling all about his gunshots, why he's here, the whole bit. Everybody's heard \"In Da Club\", not much I can say there. \"Blood Hound\" is the infamous Ja Rule diss, pretty funny, but he went crazy dissing everybody later. \"21 Questions\" was the love song with Nate Dogg, pretty good, but there would be way too much of this on the Massacre. The bonus tracks are all good too, \"Wanksta\" being the original single, spawning a new term to the masses, \"Gotta Make it to Heaven\", \"Don't Push Me\" and \"Nobody Likes Me\", a funny song.\n\nThis actually was a really good album, and I liked it a lot when it first came out. If it sounds like I have a hard time saying it, it's true, because I can't stand what he's done to the hip hop world since its release. Now he's concerned only with women, the pop star lifestyle, and beefing with every rapper he can find, which makes me pretty mad, especially because Nas, Fat Joe, and Jada are all tougher and better than him and have been around longer. He's got nothing left to prove now. 50 did a good job here and would not be able to duplicate it ever again.","classification":4,"fold":7}
{"text":"Looking back on How To Train Your Dragon, you're going to remember this amazing movie that moved you, remembering the story, the characters, the animation, but probably not the music. However, if you remember closely, the soundtrack was key to your enjoyment. It punctuated the movie. It put its stamp on classic scenes in the best way possible. John Powell has always been one of the best composers in Hollywood today, but I think this soundtrack is his crowning achievement. Having to incorporate a full range of emotions in this soundtrack, while also keeping to the spirit of the environment, it wasn't an easy task. Rest assured, this is the best soundtrack since Up. And even then, I might debate that it exceeds it.\n\nHighlights Include:\nThis is Berk\nForbidden Friendship\nTest Drive\nRomantic Fight\nSticks & Stones\n\nComparing the flying music for HTTYD & Avatar for instance is no comparison. Avatar doesn't have a track like \"Test Flight,\" which is certainly the best soundtrack piece since Up's \"Married Life.\" There's just so much life, adventure, enchantment & magic here, it soars in every way possible, and then some. And despite the fact that the track is only a couple minutes long, it uses every second to its full potential. It also serves as the theme to the movie, so it gets played off a variety of splendid way throughout the soundtrack.\n\nThe rest of the instrumental works also work quite well and they all convey the right range of emotions, from intensity (The Kill Ring), to romantic moments (Romantic Fight), to wonder and playfulness (Forbidden Friendship), to foreboding (Ready The Ships). The whole soundtrack is an absolute wonder with its massive orchestra adding that much of a grander scale to the proceedings, its variety, and its Celtic influences. And when its all said and done, there's an immense sense of satisfaction just by listening to the music here.\n\nBut as soon as the movie ended, this satisfaction only grew when I heard the song playing over the credits. That song is \"Sticks & Stones\" by Sigur Rs frontman & singer, Jnsi. It's a mixture of English & Icelandic that fits perfectly into a fast-paced sunny & hopeful indie tune that punctuates the movie in a unexpected way. I mean, you'd expect a lame pop song to play over the credits of a movie like this, not a tune by an indie legend.\n\nOverall, for soundtrack lovers, for people that loved the movie, and everybody in-between, the HTTYD soundtrack is an unexpected joyful masterpiece for soundtracks. And it's sure to keep you in the spirit of the wonderful film for a long time to come.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"...I will probably get negged right out of the top two thousand for admitting this...But...I like Kravitz's version of the song,  American woman, better than the older version. NOW HOLD ON BEFORE YOU OLDER FOLKS NEGG ME OUT! I loved the original. I always cranked it up when it came on the radio. I loved it! But BEFORE you judge me, find a good stereo...plug in this version of American Woman by Kravitz's and CRANK IT UP....Go on. I'll wait....Okay? Are ya done? Well!? Heh!!? The song was killer! Am I right!? Kravitz's slowed the tempo a bit. He played guitar with flawless, bone crushing chords with awesome force. And the dude can sing! The whole remake by Lenny Kravitz is superior in every way (except maybe the old solo...it was really cool and Kenny didn't quite get that \"whine\" out of his axe, but hey, this song is a great song for my ever EXPANDING digital library.

{"text":"Metallica's second album, 1984's \"Ride the Lightning,\" was the first real metal album I ever bought. When I bought it, I was looking for a really heavy album, so when the first track began with an acoustic intro, I was sorely disappointed. Luckily, however, I skipped to the next song, the title track, and its booming intro brought a big smile to my face. Ah, nostalgia.\n\nWith 1983's \"Kill `Em All,\" Metallica helped create thrash metal; but they followed up their debut with their sophomore album, which was released only a year later. Most metalheads have given it the credit it deserves, but I feel \"Ride the Lightning\" is still somewhat underrated, since the album that followed this one was \"Master of Puppets.\"\n\n\"Ride the Lightning\" is still fast. Most of it shoots by like...well, lightning; but it's slower, darker, heavier and more mature than \"Kill `Em All.\" James' voice is somewhat lower than it was, and his lyrics are improved. As the above Amazon editorial review mentions, James discusses several different ways to die: Armageddon, capitol punishment, suicide, being trapped under ice, etc.\n\n\"Fight Fire with Fire\" has the aforementioned acoustic intro, but it's just a tease-it doesn't last. The power chords fade in and the song becomes a breakneck speed, with rip-roaring, almost Slayer-esque guitar work. Lyrically, this songs seems to be about the Apocalypse.\n\n\"Ride the Lightning\" is the album's most popular single. It's another thrashy number, with booming rhythms, fiery chug and churn riffs (which go from fast to faster to slow to fast), and an awesome, lengthy Hammett solo. \"Ride the Lightning\" has good lyrics about being executed by the electric chair, and it also has a surprise ending, but most of this song is an instrumental.\n\n\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" is slower paced, but still loud and heavy. The first two minutes of this song is an instrumental, beginning with a bell ringing, then the heavy, repetitive, churning guitars kick in. This song has another good, winding solo near the end.\n\n\"Fade to Black\" is really morbid because it has depressing, introspective lyrics about suicide. It begins with a distant guitar solo, but the acoustic strums actually make the first part of this song rather pretty. (Pretty in a dark and depressing way, but pretty nonetheless.) The choruses still have heavy riffs, and the end is an ascending and cascading solo.\n\n\"Trapped Under Ice\" is very fast paced with another short but sweet guitar solo near the middle.\n\n\"Escape\" has vocals which make it radio ready (it has good vocal hooks). Most of the song has propulsive riffs with thunderous drumming, but the choruses are slower.\n\n\"Creeping Death\" begins with machine gun guitars and drumming, before changing to another fast beat with guitars that burn straight ahead. And, of course, there's another stellar solo near the end.\n\n\"The Call of KTULU\" is the album's instrumental. In my opinion, this song IS as great as \"Orion\" (from Metallica's next album, \"Master of Puppets,\") and it's a very good way to end the album. It starts out slowly and ominously with wind wooshes, but then it suddenly becomes a lot faster. This song builds well and has superb guitar and drum work.\n\nSo, this disc is another wonderful landmark album and it's still one of the best C.D.'s of the past two decades. All of the qualities of a classic metal or thrash metal album are here: long songs (about 6 minutes per song), rapid fire riffs, ripping solos, an instrumental track, and even some acoustic guitar licks. In conclusion, if you want a complete metal collection, or if you just like heavy metal, you need this album more than you need your next breath.","classification":5,"fold":7}

While many solo female artists overdub their voices to make the sound fuller, these women get the same effect by just singing together. This - their first CD - is an EP with five tracks. Four of them have nice hooks and it was a good choice to start the album with \"Serious\", the hardest rocker in the batch. Only \"Color Love Blue\" disappointed me, as it didn't hold up to the others. Nothing deep in the lyrics here but if you listen to country radio a lot you should enjoy this album. And as an EP it's priced right.\n\nSteve Ramm\n\"Anything Phonographic\"","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"I am an opera snob.  Musically, I prefer the 20th century and beyond, and I get tired of the old repertoire.  But sometimes, even confirmed 12 tone enthusiasts like myself enjoy a little Bellini.  Let's face it...the great masters were, well, masterful.  This dirt cheap collection has eliminated the need for me to pull out individual operas to get just the loveliest arias.  Here the all are, glittering in the sunlight, sung by some of the finest sopranos of the last 40 years.  Sumi Jo's definitive version of the aria for the Queen of the Night from Mozart's Magic Flute is worth the price of admission alone. These arias are instantly familiar to opera buffs, but the casual listener will know many of these, and it is an easy way to bring new converts in to the fold.  Listen, this music is glorious, tuneful, exquisitely sung, and a wonderful way to sip at the chalice of immortal music.  Sound is generally excellent.  The collection would be a bargain at 10x the price, and there is absolutely no reason not to pick this up at the crazy bargain price of $1.  Yes, even you folks who usually prefer Wozzeck. This music is simply stunning.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I had high hopes.  They were dashed.  Upon first listen I noticed that the dynamics, the separation of sounds via level placements, were lacking.  Thats this albums biggest problem.  The musics not muddy or anything but its hard to appreciate the blend because its all set close to the same level.  Want to snack on some guitargotta listen for them.  Wanna gush over the bass lines--youre going to have to swim through seas of cymbals.  Even the drums, which are more evident, still can be washed out if you're not paying attention.  The only thing that doesnt suffer is LaTorres vocals.  Theyre front and center and easy to pick out (and Im fine with that) but though he can mine Tate at times, perhaps hes doing this too often now and isn't developing his own voice, his range is a lot more limited than I realized.\n\nIt took me several listens to appreciate any one of the songs and I had to pay attention more than I wanted to (or thought that I should have to) in order to develop even a moderate like of some of them.  Bulletproof is the easy obvious stand-out track and the first three songs are decent but past this its pretty mediocre (excepting, for my tastes, the mellow Just Us which refreshingly gets the dynamics right and is a far better song for it).  If the ryche leaves us in this condition and doesnt develop more consistent dynamics then Im afraid this human might not continue to be a part of their condition.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"Yeah it's true that this was the most overrated release of 2003. But it's also true that this was the best album that he has ever made(next to Guess Who's Back). Every wack album after this proves it. In Da Club was a huge record for him and Many Men, Wanksta, What Up Gangsta pretty much kept this album afloat. Eminem makes two dominating appearances on here(Patiently Waiting and Dont Push Me). Eminem floored 50 on Patiently Waiting and Both Em and Lloyd Banks leave 50 in the dust in Dont Push Me. Back Down while overrated was a good diss record towards Ja Rule and Murda Inc but they could have kept Alex Thomas fruit basket a** off of the record though. Gotta Make It Heaven is tight as well as the three bonus tracks: Wanksta, U Not Like Me and Life's On The Line. Contrary to popular belief this album is not a classic. Blood Hound feat Young Buck is weak. Like My Style feat Tony Yayo is straight garbage and Poor Lil Rich, P.I.M.P., and 21 Question feat Nate Dogg have filler written all over them. By the way, the bonus DVD is not worth mentioning. Other than that, this album was good but way overhyped. Even though GRODT is overrated in comparison to what came after it, GRODT is one of the few G-unit releases worth mentioning. Standouts: WHAT UP GANGSTA, PATIENTLY WAITING, MANY MEN(WISH DEATH), IN DA CLUB, HEAT, IF I CANT, BACK DOWN, DONT PUSH ME, GOTTA MAKE IT TO HEAVEN, U NOT LIKE ME and LIFE'S ON THE LINE.","classification":4,"fold":7}

Many of the songs cut a lot deeper than their pop veneer would indicate on first listen, including, especially, the opening cut, \"While You See A Chance\", which tells people not to let opportunities pass them by, and the title track, which is about how hard connecting with others can be. Winwood's belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 for drug-smuggling was unjustly convicted makes even disco pap like \"Second Hand Woman\" and \"Spanish Dancer\" bearable, and results in ARC OF A DIVER being an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I've been looking forward to this album after hearing the first two pre-released tracks from it, those being \"Thank You\" and \"Not Today\". I was especially excited after hearing the latter song because it indicated that this would probably be one of Sevendust's best works. And it sure is. Although I wouldn't necessarily say this is as good as \"Animosity\", I would put this very close to \"Cold Day Memory\" and \"Seasons\", and it's no surprise they made an album this good after their acoustic experiment last year, and especially coming off of \"Black Out The Sun\", which was OK at best, but not as great. There are moments on this album that will remind you of the typical Sevendust sound such as on \"Thank You\" and \"Peace And Destruction\", which shows that the band is very good at being consistent. But, then you have songs such as \"Death Dance\", \"Not Today\", \"Torched\", \"Chop\", and \"Cease And Desist\", which are pretty unique for the band. \"Chop\" especially is different, as it seems like they took some influence from their acoustic project \"Time Travelers And Bonfires\". Also, I'd suggest you check out the bonus track \"Slave The Prey\", which is probably a big highlight here next to \"Not Today\", which is probably one of the heaviest and best Sevendust tracks I've ever heard. Overall, I'm really enjoying this album, and I hope that they can continue in this direction.\n\nRating: 88\/100","classification":5,"fold":7}

You probably won't like all of them, but I predict that you will really like some of them.  And the more you listen and acquire the taste, you will be hooked for life. And then go see an opera in person, preferably a Mozart Opera. I grew up with Country and Western music followed by the rock and roll of the sixties and stumbled onto opera by accident in the late seventies.  And now it is my favorite music - not that I've given up the music of my youth. Music fads come and go, but opera has withstood the test of time for centuries and still lives today in the hearts of many the world over.","classification":5,"fold":7}
{"text":"\"Hard Bargain\" is an album that features eleven new songs.  Emmylou has never sounded better.  Her voice conveys warmth, joy and empathy on these tracks. \"Hard Bargain\" is about having the strength to move on in life despite feeling weary. I like the banjo playing on this song. \"New Orleans\" is an up tempo song about the resilience of the city of New Orleans.  \"Big Black Dog\" is an enjoyable song about finding homes for homeless dogs. \"Nobody\" is a song about feeling comfortable about being single. This song is also about having hope that love is right around the corner.  \"My Name is Emmett Till\" is a song about a black teenager who was killed in 1955 for talking to a white woman.  Emmylou is a great story teller.  This song proves it.  Emmett Till death started the civil rights movement and the call for peace.  Emmylou conveys this in the song.  Her vocals are very moving on this song.  \"The Road\" is a song about Emmylou's singing partner Gram Parsons who died in 1973.  This tune is about the special relationship they had with each other.  \"Ship on His Arm\" is the best love song on this album. This song is very pretty.  It is the first song that contains a reference to a tattoo in it. \"Six White Cadillacs\" is a song that puts me in a good mood. I love the spirited tone of this song. \"Darlin' Kate\" is a beautiful song about saying farewell to a loved one. The musical arrangements of this song are so beautiful. \"Goodnight Old World\" is a song that gives me a sense of peace. \"Home Sweet Home\" is a song that makes me appreciate my home. Emmylou caresses every note on this song perfectly.  This song is very pleasant. \"Cross Yourself\" has a spiritual tone that I really like. \"Lonely Girl\" is a lovely tune.  Emmylou's voice makes me feel a sense of empathy for all the lonely girls in the world. This is a very enjoyable album from Emmylou Harris.","classification":5,"fold":7}

It's a beautiful, haunting song.  I have no idea what the lyrics are in English, but it's sound wonderful.\n\nIn all, this is a fantastic album.

{"text":"Empire has got its hooks in me, I like the story line, I like the characters, I love Cookie and I really love the music. The first couple of episodes I couldn't decide which songs I wanted to buy. When my wife told me she read there was going to be a soundtrack available after season one ended I decided to wait for it. Then in episode seven Jussie and Yazz performed live in the Moment and I couldn't take anymore, I went to Amazon and bought six of the songs I liked from various episodes. It wasn't so much the song, I had heard it before because it was part of an earlier episode; it was the way they weaved the song into what was going on. It was the start of Empire Records IPO party, all these luxury cars are pulling up, Jussie and Yazz are outside in the cold and they start singing live in the Moment, for me the energy was unbelievable. This is what I love about the show; You get a glimpse at the ultra rich and powerful, people that play by rules they make, there are provocative characters that have layers you rarely see on Network TV, there is the dysfunction that is everyday life but magnified because of the power the characters wield and then there is this great music that puts an explanation point on everything that is happening. With this song there is a message I can strongly relate to. For so many years my life has been about planning for the future, now that most of my friends and family members are dead or have illnesss that limit their ability to function the way they once did I embrace every moment Im alive. I not only live in the now I say yes to life and not just any life but life by design. Ive let go, I let this energy I cant understand and don't want to understand lead me in this dance of life. I have no fear because that which it is, is  what I am and that which I am is what it is, it is what I was before I was born and what I will be when I die, it is the Architect of this journey Im on. I plan to enjoy and live in every moment I have left allotted to me.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I recently purchased a new turntable which caused me to dig out the stash of vinyl LPs that had been stored in boxes in my basement for years. I rediscovered a lot of the music that I grew up on in the 1980s that I hadn't really listened to in a while from bands like Duran Duran, The Pet Shop Boys and U2. Here on \"The Desired Effect,\" Brandon Flowers captures the spirit of those recordings in a fresh and modern way.\n\nThis is a keyboard driven album, with guest appearances from Bruce Hornsby and Neil Tennant from the Pet Shop Boys, that delivers on the big anthems that Flowers is known for. Flowers has such a unique voice that it is hard to separate his music from that of the Killers and that's to be expected. What is different about this solo record from the recent Killers' work is the tone of the album, it's up-beat and Flowers seems to be having a whole lot of fun making this music.\n\nThe album is strong lyrically, which is not something I can say about most pop albums being churned out lately. The sounds are big here and Flowers' vocals soars above some absolutely lush sounds. It is an album that I think will appeal to a wide audience from the Killers faithful to anyone that likes 80's music since this album is so heavily influenced there.\n\nI think my favorite song after a few listening is the stripped down \"Between Me and You\" that starts with the drumbeat from Springsteen's \"I'm on Fire\" and morphs with synth riffs and a heavy bass line into something sonically huge.\n\nOverall, a damn good pop record where each of the 10 tracks feels like it belongs there and forms a cohesive piece of art. It is an album that just sounds great played loud out of my stereo. I will be hunting down a vinyl copy shortly.\n\nRecommended.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"For the past five or six years,I've been hearing a lot about UK multi instrumentalist Mark Ronson and his contributions to the \"nu disco\/funk\" sound that was heavily indebted to the electro\/boogie sound of the late 70's\/early 80's. Actually much in the same vein as Jamie Lidell was before him. Yet it was my friend\/blogging partner Henrique that exposed me to a certain song from Ronson and Bruno Mars that really caught not only my ear,but apparently the entire nation at the end of last year. Not too long ago,I discovered that this album was going to be released in the middle of this month. And not only would this song be on it,but Stevie Wonder and funkified southern rapper Mystikal would be involved as well. Even that couldn't prepare me for what came into my ear hole with this music.\n\n  \"Uptown's First Finale\" opens up the album with an electronically derived cinematic soul delight featuring Wonder on a beautifully fluid harmonica melody. \"Summer Breaking\" has a swirling,percussive and creamily orchestrated Chicago funky soul sound with a jazzy electric piano flavor. \"Feel Right\" comes out of the album in full James Brown mode with the funky drums,bass and rhythm guitar breaking in and out as Mystikal throws down his JB style funk vocals with ultimate authority. \"Uptown Funk\" is of course what bought me here. And it's right out of the box The Time mixed with some EWF style horns and Bruno Mars's gravelly MJ style vocal turns.\n\n  \"I Can't Love\" has that Brazilian jazz-funk style drum timing with a scaling melody featuring layers of glittering high pitched and bass synthesizers. \"Daffodils\" has a probing melody and a crunchier bass\/guitar oriented funk\/pop oriented groove about it. \"Crack In The Pearl\" is a sweeping,very jazzy electro\/boogie epic mid tempo ballad that goes into the Steely Dan-like jazz\/rock-pop shuffle of \"In Case Of Fire\". \"Leaving Los Feliz\" is a fuzzier alternative funk style groove. \"Heavy And Rolling has a very singable melody again with a slowed down post disco bass\/guitar style groove. The album ends with the second part of \"Crack In The Pearl\"-a totally different,faster and funkier staccato clavinet arrangement featuring Stevie Wonder yet again.\n\n  It truly looks as if the revival of funk and disco,genres that embrace instrumental eloquence and a genuinely joyous state of body and mind,is indeed going on strong in in safe hands with artists like Mark Ronson. This album definitely embraces the Minneapolis approach of orchestration synthesizers over highly melodic and grooving sound scapes. But the most impressive thing about the album is how it presents funk as a truly multi dimensional music. Stereotypically a lot of people like to think of funk and disco and either rhythmically limited or a novelty retro music. Drawing from the structured approach of James Brown,the jazzy presition of Steely Dan and the stripped down directness of Prince? This album showcases funk that's not only fun,but that also makes it clear the music derives from very professional sources. And that Mark Ronson intends to continue with that. While January is typically a dry month for interesting new music? Mark Ronson has got 2015 started with one serious funky bang!","classification":5,"fold":7}
{"text":"Hey, on the solo - unidentified voice captured at the beginning of Sun Goddess\n\nFive HUGE Stars! This certified-gold Sun Goddess Ramsey Lewis album, with the distinctive Herb Breuer photo of golden girl Susan Leigh Scott, was a popular song that generated the song Sun Goddess on which his former Ramsey Lewis Trio drummer, Maurice White, returned with his group Earth, Wind, and Fire to play and sing those distinctive background vocals, probably led by ace singer Phillip Bailey and White himself. The album went to No 1 and the single went highest to No 5 on the Disco charts.\n\nThe song starts with the familiar modulating guitar riff, synthesizer intro, and Bailey & White lead the falsetto vocal riff that recurrs throughout the song, which includes 2 lengthy keyboard solos by Lewis and a hot tenor sax solo by Don Myrick.

{"text":"British pop singer Dido returns after a five-year hiatus with her fourth studio album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Girl-Who-Got-Away\/dp\/B00BWGL6BS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Girl Who Got Away<\/a>, released via RCA.  Girl Who Got Away follows up 2008s underperforming&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Safe-Trip-Home\/dp\/B001EO2UKO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Safe Trip Home<\/a>, which was deemed favorable by many critics. Girl Who Got Away is a solid album for the most part, though not one that will likely one that will revitalize her previous commercial success or buy her new legions of fans.  \"Let Us Move On\" smartly brings in burgeoning rap darling Kendrick Lamar, but the chances of large exposure of the track seems unlikely.\n\n\"No Freedom\" seems concerned with the ambience, with Dido's vocals laden with reverb.  She sounds incredibly relaxed, which complements the folk-pop quality within the cut.  \"No Freedom\" is by no means an intense cut in itself, but the vocal arrangement and addition of instruments on the chorus add more body and intensity to the cut itself. \"Girl Who Got Away\" follows consistently, opening with cool, pulsating synths.  Dido's vocals are smooth (particularly her upper register), lacking the echoing reverb of the opener.  Simply on the chorus, Dido sings \"If only for today \/ I wanna be \/ the girl who got away \/ the lover who really loved \/ the dancer who danced \/ to the last song...\" The main rub with the title cut? Perhaps Dido comes off too relaxed and slightly lacking in personality.\n\n\"Let Us Move On\" finds Dido continuing in her casual, mysterious vocal approach, complemented by production to match the sentiment (Jeff Bhasker is onboard here).  Like the previous two cuts, this one is pleasant and Dido keeps things simple, particularly vocally on the chorus (\"Let us move on...for this is short \/ and it will pass\").  Kendrick Lamar drops a verse that matches the sentiment of both Dido and the cut itself.  It isn't the year's greatest triumph per say - it feels like it is missing something - but it is an enjoyable cut if not necessarily exceptional.\n\nOn \"Blackbird\", Dido continues to indulge into her refined vocals, if perhaps a bit much.  Listeners do get a clever lyric, intact with a staccato vocal execution: \"He put the coffee in the cup and with milk he filled it up \/ he added sugar and I never knew he liked it like that...\"  The production has some nice cues, though remains subdued. Songwriter\/producer Greg Kurstin assists on \"End of The Night\", which takes a cool electro-pop approach, intact with driving synth and programming.  Dido's best moment is during the bridge in which she exploits her upper register (\"After the fall comes loves \/ I hat to hate and love to love\"). The results? Pretty good.\n\n\"Sitting On The Roof Of The World\" is one of Girl Who Got Away's strongest showings. Dido sounds beautiful, commanding, and never over-sings and the production matches her reservedness.  Backing vocals accentuate the lead during the second and successive iterations of the chorus.  The chorus itself is simple, but there is a beautiful innocence in its penning: \"There I was \/ sitting on the roof of the world  \/ there I was, there I was \/ Not knowing how I go there or how to leave...\" \"Love To Blame\" contrasts the simplicity of \"Sitting On The Roof\" with an interesting groove with a reggae undertone coupled with a pop\/electro beat.  Dido's upper register continues to shine, particularly given her breathy vocal approach. Lyrically, she hits a high mark with lyrics \"She said I've dotted my I's and I've crossed my T's \/ had time for friends when they needed me...\"\n\"Go Dreaming\" makes one nod their head, given the percussive, driving beat with Europop flavor.  On \"Happy New Year\", Dido agains floats too casually, a detraction throughout Girl Who Got Away.  \"Loveless Hearts\" is more commanding than the latter, with Dido's vocals always commanding without necessarily being 'fiery' or forced.  Closing cut \"Day Before We Went To War\" is appropriately placed, but isn't quite as enjoyable as the beginning trio or the easygoing juggernaut \"Sitting On The Roof Of The World\".\n\nDoes Dido miss the mark? Nope, she sounds solid and for the most part&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Girl-Who-Got-Away\/dp\/B00BWGL6BS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Girl Who Got Away<\/a>&nbsp;has more solid moments than ill advised ones. The main problem for Dido is that sometimes the productions are too cool and the vibe too restrained and unflustered. Usually, being 'flustered' might be a detraction, but a shakeup wouldn't kill Dido.  Not known as a vocalist for histrionics (nor is that expected of her), Girl Who Got Away could have been even better and made a bigger splash with some more risks.  But examining this set for what it is, it is solid.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I became a Taylor Swift fan right out of the gate when her debut album dropped in late 2006.  And she wasn't just ANY country gal; she could sing it like the rest of them!  She let the world know who she was and that she meant business.  Several years later -- and several EP's in between -- Taylor's next big record is yet another mega-smash.  Quite simply, a lot of the songs on here are hit-packed.\n\nFor example, there's the upbeat title track -- which is also one of my personal favorites.  Then you have the two pop crossover hits currently on heavy rotation:  \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" and \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\"  Speaking of that, I loved watching Taylor's STELLAR performance of both songs on New Year's Rockin' Eve 2012 (which was just 2 weeks ago, mind you).  Yes, she knows how to bring it!\n\nA few more of my favorite personal tracks are \"Stay Stay Stay\", \"The Lucky Ones\" and the duet with Mister Snow Patrol himself -- \"The Last Time.\"  The pairing seems very fitting if you listen to how the song actually sounds.  Then there's \"Sad Beautiful Tragic\", another personal fave.\n\nAs most people already know, Taylor is known for writing a breakup song about one of her ex's.  But hey, it still makes for some great music, doesn't it?!  It's sometimes fun to guess just whom she is writing about.  But once in a while, she will step out of her usual comfort zone to write a third-person view song, such as for The Hunger Games soundtrack (i.e., \"Eyes Open\".)  I truly don't believe that there's nothing Taylor CAN'T do.  She has truly outdone herself, so I look forward to what she brings for her next album.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"THE BEST SONGS ARE ALSO ON LIGHT FUSE, GET AWAY.\n\nReleased in 1997, this is Widespread Panic's fifth CD.  The sound quality is very good.  It is 49 minutes long, but the last 4 minutes of Greta is just a very annoying scraping, buzzing sound.  The CD originally came in a cardboard foldout case.\n\nThere is something that is not quite right with this CD.  The production values and engineering are very good.  I think it is that the compositions are just not very good.\n\nThis is one of those singer\/song writer albums that every jam band puts out.  Everyone wants to do an American Beauty (Grateful Dead's landmark album).  Moe had Dither, String Cheese Incident has One Step Closer and Phish had Picture of Nectar.  They were all failures.\n\nTo make a singer\/song writer album, the group usually brings in an outside producer.  This producer than molds the album around his vision, instead of the band's.  It usually doesn't work.\n\nJohn Keane produced this album.  He also produced the previous Ain't Life Grand, where he was very succesful.  I think that with Ain't Life Grand, he made the album better by cleaing up the sound, but not interfering with the group's artistic vision.  On this CD, Bombs & Butterflies, he might have too much influence.\n\nIt also sounds like the group is trying to copy others.  Aunt Avis sounds like LA country rock by someone like the Buffalo Springfield or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.  Happy, is an Allman Brothers type instrumental, but is not very interesting.  Many of the songs are along the standard Southern Rock music style.  You Got Yours sounds like it has a little Deep Purple mixed in.  Greta has a Pink Floyd like opening.\n\nThe album does have a very good sound.  The playing and mix are excellent.  He also contained John Herrman's keyboard playing so that really enhances the songs, instead of detracting from them.\n\nBut, the songs just are not very good.  And the best songs,  Rebirtha and Greta are on the live CD Light Fuse, Get Away and Tall Boy is on Classic City.  You could get those and skip this CD.\n\nThe worst songs, Aunt Avis and Hope in a Hopeless World were written by someone else.  The group should stick to performing their own songs, or JJ Cale songs.\n\nIf you are new to Widespread Panic, get the live CD Classic City and then get the first two CD's, Widespread Panic and Space Wrangler, which are fantastic, five star albums.","classification":2,"fold":7}

Like the \"I saw the future of rock'n'roll,\" comment about Springsteen, the \"best television show, ever\" review seemed out of control...until you saw Springsteen\/Sopranos, and realized the reviewer was right on the mark.\nThat said, the soundtrack is good, but not great.  To have a copy of \"Woke Up This Morning\" on the CD while driving is sublime; a couple of other things are worth it.  Springsteen's inclusion is great, but you should already be carrying a copy of NEBRASKA with you everywhere you go, so who needs another copy?  The best thing here is the Nick Lowe song, \"The Beast In Me,\" which I listen to over and over and over--I mean, I played that song 8 times in a row last night, I just can't get enough of it.\nBut some of the other songs here...the Elvis song--and this comes from an Elvis fan--is pointless.  It's that middle-of-his-career Elvis, where there's an impressive style, but no emotion. The Wyclef Jean song is junk.  The Los Lobos is just average Los Lobos.  The Eurythmics song is the same old Eurythmics song--and it's been played to death on SoftRock radio stations.\nAgain, I'm a Sopranos addict.  I bought this, I'll probably get the next one.  If you aren't a huge fan of the show, with something visual to relate the Sinatra song to, for example, it might not work for you.  I love Sinatra, but \"It Was A Very Good Year\" doesn't exactly dovetail with R.L. Burnside or Bob Dylan.\nI tried to quit watching the Sopranos, y'know.  Tried to go back to The Practice and E.R..

{"text":"As a fan of Audiomachine, I awaited the release of \"Helios\" with excitement, and gave it a listen as soon as it was released.  Once again, I am in awe of the talent of the composers and I find myself very inspired by their work.  \"Helios\" has an epic quality, the kind of quality that can only be delivered by a full orchestra - and indeed a bit of research shows that a 175-piece orchestra was used to record the cues on the album.\n\nThe music was composed specifically for film and television advertising: in fact, you may recognize some of the music on this album from advertisements for \"The Hobbit\" and \"Life of Pi\".  Normally this music is off limits to the public, and Audiomachine does have many albums that have not been commercially released - but fortunately they have decided to share some of their albums and so we are now lucky enough to be able to purchase the MP3.\n\nThe album starts off with a percussive powerhouse in \"Colussus\" [Track 1], which captures your attention right away.  Then, the album goes to some very interesting places - \"Farewell to Earth\" [Track 10] and \"Apollo's Triumph\" [Track 13] are two of my personal favorites.\n\nThe main criticism I have of this album is that at 35 minutes in length it is far too short.  The last two albums from Audiomachine were longer: \"Chronicles\" had over an hour of music, and \"Epica\" had 43 minutes.  I have always believed in quality over quantity, but as a fan of this music I simply wanted more.\n\nTo those unfamiliar with Audiomachine, I would recommend purchasing their two previous albums first:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Chronicles\/dp\/B007RJSQYE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Chronicles<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Epica\/dp\/B008HYVGLI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Epica<\/a>.  But for those who already own\/enjoy the two previous albums, this is a no-brainer: buy \"Helios\" now!","classification":4,"fold":7}
{"text":"The weekend before last I saw \"10 Cloverfield Lane\" in the theater (more on that later). I was struck by the orchestral score and made a mental note to myself that I needed to check it out. When I started looking into it, my search led me to this. The orchestral score is composed by Bear McCreary, best known for his work on various high-profile TV series (The Walking Dead, Outlander, Black Sails, etc.). Here McCreary ups his game a level or two, in ways not seen before from him.\n\n\"10 Cloverfield Lane - Music from the Motion Picture\" (14 tracks; 64 min.) opens with \"Michelle\" (as the movie opens, and Michelle decides to leave her boyfriend and get out of New Orleans). It is a 6 min. mini-suite of sorts, exploring various emotions along the way. What a great way to kick off the soundtrack. And when we get to the next track \"The Concrete Cell\", this is an 8+ min. epic track that enforces the dark mood and desperation that besets Michelle and Emmett. It is rare these days that we get treated to such long soundtrack pieces, and while after the initial two super-long tracks many of them are quite shorter, there still are several other long ones to come still. \"Two Stories\" is one of my favorites on here, with more of that threatening undercurrent that leaves you wondering, almost anxious. It is one of several tracks on here that made me think back of Bernard Hermann's work all those decades ago when he score many of Hitchcock's movies, and I do mean this as a high complement. \"Valencia\" is al all-out action piece. The last track on here is what plays over the movie's end titles. In all, I am very impressed with this score. PLEASE NOTE: this soundtrack contains only the orchestral score, and it leaves out the various songs that appear in the movie, including \"I Think We're Alone Now\", by Tommy James & The Shondellas, in a pivotal scene, but also \"Tell Him\" (by The Exciters) and \"Venus\" (by Frankie Avalon).\n\nAs to the movie itself, it is pretty darn good. Not an outright sequel to \"Cloverfield\", producer J.J. Abrams and newcomer-director  Dan Trachtenberg craft a mystery thriller that keeps you guessing for a very long time (in the best possible way) what the heck is going on. Was Michelle recued? or kidnapped? Come for the mystery, stay for the jaw-dropping last 30 minutes! \"10 Cloverfield Lane\", both the soundtrack and the movie, is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Love this song--which is kind of like 2 related songs in one.  It addresses what it's like to be on your own in life.  I esp. like the refrain: \"Don't go crying to your mama, 'cause you're on your own in the real world.\"  This should be the mantra today rather than dependency which seems to be a contemporary political current.  I bet Carl G. Jung would have greatly approved of it--as opposed to infantile grandiosity and the Peter Pan Syndrome.\n\nNot only are the lyrics pithy and valuable, but the melody and rhythm are catchy and engaging.  I like playing it and enjoyed watching and listening to Jena Irene sing it with Paramore on American Idol.  I very much enjoyed watching lead singer Hayley Williams dance while singing--she has great moves IMHO.  After I got this song, I listened to other Paramore songs and purchased \"Still Into You\" as well.","classification":5,"fold":7}

In my opinion, the differences are insignificant. Their music is very peppy and uplifting. It makes you wanna get up and dance your legs off. I did, back then. Now I'm old and less agile.

{"text":"These thematic collections from X5 and Amazon are low-cost sets of quality music designed to set a specific mood -- in this case relaxation, which they have actually covered before, but that's OK.\n\nI often make my own playlists and mixes of classical music. But these collections are still useful and a lot of fun for the price. This set is going for $1.99 right now, which is a pretty darn good deal for over 9.5 hours of quality recordings.\n\nThe downside is that works are often sliced and diced, with movements taken out from integral works and offered up on their own. I can accept this on a set designed for a specific mood -- like \"relaxation\" here.\n\nBut there is also a lot of music here I haven't heard before, which is a big benefit because it gives you ideas for more music to listen to. The piece by Jan Sandstrm (track 36), for example, was a very pleasant atmospheric surprise, as was track 71 by Penderecki, although it was definitely a little more edgy. I could name several more, but you get the idea.\n\nThis set covers a lot of centuries of musical history, from Josquin Desprez in the Renaissance (one of my favorites) up to Arvo Prt in the 20th century (also one of my favorites). The ride through music history also stops just about everywhere in between, at least briefly. It even makes a couple stops with Dmitri Shostakovich, who shows that even he had his \"relaxing\" moments.\n\nI've given all the tracks a quick listen, but haven't heard the set all the way through. In fact I probably never will; these sets really seem to serve best as background music while working, talking, cooking or hanging out. The set includes a relatively large proportion of guitar and baroque music but of course a lot more.\n\nThe bitrates vary between 186 and 242 Kbps, a little on the low side, but the sound is still pretty good. One complaint is a lack of sound leveling between tracks. If you turn up the sound on a quiet track you might well get blasted out on the next one -- not conducive to relaxation! Attention to that kind of detail would have been going the extra mile. Total download size is 931 MB.\n\nOverall a good set, highly recommended, especially at the idiot-proof price of $1.99. It may even be worth full price later on if you like the convenience and variety that collections like these offer.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Too many times all the positive hype ends up in me being disappointed. Not so in this case; Ryley Walker is the real deal and this album is a delight!\n\nIf you've read the other reviews, you pretty know much know what to expect. There are a couple of songs that remind me a bit of vintage Nick Drake, but for the most part this sounds a lot like John Martyn during his \"Solid Air\" period. In fact, there is one song on here that sounds so much like \"Real World\" that I thought it was a cover version at first. But as another reviewer suggested, sounding like Martyn is far from a bad thing, and Ryley Walker is not some sort of unimaginative copycat. His guitar playing skills are very impressive, his vocals are pleasing, and he also has a flair for penning intelligent lyrics. What more can you say? This guy is indeed the total package and I'm excited to have discovered him.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"This CD is a throwback to my youth.  I was about twelve years old when it came out--back when Boyz 2 Men was truly  a hot commodity.  They have a wonderful \"old school\" flavor reminiscent of the old doowop guy groups of 1960s.  This is especially evident in the four part harmonies, the smooth and romantic lyrics and the original interpretations of old standards (\"Yesterday\").\n\nWhere do I begin to describe the mood of this wonderful and innovative R&B album?  There is something for everyone on this CD.  We have the funky, catchy \"Thank You\" that samples from \"La-Di-Da-Di\" performed by Doug E. Fresh.  The hook is infectious!  We have \"All Around the World\" to get you up and dancing, no doubt.  One of my personal favorites is \"I Sit Away,\" written by Tony Rich (of the Tony Rich Project fame).  It has a haunting hook and a beautiful, introspective feel.  Truly an ode to solitude.  There are also a couple of songs on this album that became huge hits for the fellas back in the early 1990s.  They include \"I'll Make Love to You\" (on those songs to get you in the mood), and \"Water Runs Dry.\"\n\nOne of the strongest points of this album is the luscious arrangements and fine tuning of production on each of the cuts.  Even my least favorite of the songs--\"50 Candles\"--has a very sexy, clean and catchy arrangment.\n\nCheck this out!  And all of you young ones out there, don't write the Boyz as just another R&B band from the 1990s.  They were truly in a class by themselves.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"It is amazing that this album is so truly great coming 18 years after Faith No Mores last release 1997s Album of the Year. After testing the waters with a 2009 reunion Faith No More finally have delivered a new studio album. New material from reformed acts can be a dangerous thing. Often adding nothing to earlier work and end up usually feeling out of place when put next to earlier work, thankfully no such problems with Sol Invictus which from start to finish is a fine album.\n\nFrom the laid back, moody opener of the title track Sol Invictus to album closer From The Dead Faith No More demonstrate that they still have a lot to offer in 2015 and at a time when rock is supposedly dead Faith No More prove that it is only dead to those who don't know where to look. The early signs were good with the Black Friday release of MotherF*****r which sounded like a different version of Tomahawks I.O.U to the second single the driving Superhero which was a straight up throw back to Faith No More KFAD 1994 era.\n\nBassist Billy Gould really shines this album with his bass driving a number of tracks such as Separation Anxiety and album stand-out Matador. If this album had been released in 1999 or early 2000 it would have been the album that the current line up of the band would have made, that fact that it came in 2015 does not distract.\n\nMake no mistake this is a great Faith No More album, Tomahawk fans will notice similarities (in particular Cone of Shame & Motherf*****r) between that bands past release and this. That is to be expected as Patton has released 4 albums with them. At 10 songs some will say it is too short but I feel it is the right length and perhaps there is more to come as on this form it would be truly disappointing if they do not follow Sol Invictus up with more material.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Viewed as a comeback of sorts for Linkin Park, they return to basics after the highly experimental \"Thousand Suns\" and the OK but not great \"Living Things.\" The guitars are suddenly heavier,  Chester Bennington screams and rapper Mike Shinoda is more prominent on this album than on the previous two. And always a sign that a band wants to let you know they're still relevant, there are plenty of special guests. \"The Hunter\" also ditches producer Rick Rubin for a co-production between Brad Delson and Shinoda.\n\nDoes it all work? On a superficial level, yes. It grinds out the aggro-metal-rap that made the band's bones back with 2000's \"Hybrid Theory.\" \"The Hunter\" opens with a very aggressive salvo, Chester screaming out his failures for \"Keys To The Kingdom,\" but it ends with a little kid shouting. Yes, the guys in Linkin Park are now daddies. Rage now goes inward instead of outward. On \"A Thousand Suns,\" that meant moody introspection, now it's marked by hollering \"Rebellion.\" Rap legend Rakim drops by on the exhilarating \"Guilty All The Same,\" but it's just so he can complain about how record companies treat their bands. I hate my job, too, but I'm not a rich rock band.  Kind of kills the thrill. Another guest star wasted is Tom Morello. If I had him on my album, I'd be expecting some rip-roaring guitar solos, Instead, he's buried on a mellow instrumental called \"Drawbar.\" WTF?\n\n\"The Hunter\" has plenty going for it; it's not a total bow-wow. Delson's guitars are way more prominent than on the last two albums. He's given more room to blister chord his way through \"The Hunter\" (and aggravates me even more that Morello was not utilized for his real skills), a credit to the band trying to recapture it's old glories. Not a bad attempt, but you've heard them doing better.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"Purchased the Vinyl locally yesterday, but wanted to share the joy with my Amazon friends where I buy most of my new music. The Vinyl is good-to-go and so is the included 320kbps MP3 download card which worked without a hitch.\n\nI liked the entire album from the first spin. You can feel J-ho's unmistakable talent all over the music and Iggy Pop does a fantastic job as well. A great collaboration and a really enjoyable listen! A+++\n\nUpdated - I wanted to give another thumbsup to the quality of the vinyl. Playing it again today, it's completely flat (as in no warps) and it's incredibly QUIET as far as background and areas between tracks are just dead silent. The recording is completely LUSH. These days records seem to be a crapshoot and you can buy this one with confidence. Very reasonably priced as well. I have a record cleaning machine and use Audio Intelligent fluids, but I've never cleaned this record other than a very light carbon brushing. It's just that good out of the box. If they can keep lowering vinyl prices, and keep the quality up, I think that's all we can ask for. I have a very modest setup Technics SL-220 with AT95e, TC750 phono pre into a Yamaha RX-V377 and Energy speakers... Nothing fancy but good vinyl sounds incredible..","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I bought this primarily to hear the Deller led \"Alexander's Feast,\" my LP copy of which disappeared some years ago, and the Chandos Anthems that similarly went by the wayside. The Mann-led anthems have help up well; the \"Alexander\" not so much so despite some good solo work from the soprano and bass. Deller and the Oriana Orchestra give a pretty staid reading (with an ubiquitous organ pumping in volume) when compared with more recent accounts of Gardiner (Philips) and Christophers (who also gives us the concertos Handel performed with the oratorio\/ode) (Collins Classics).\n\n As I indicated, the Chandos Anthems 1-6 are outstanding with excellent solo contributions from Boatwright and Bressler. I think the original 3 LP set was restricted to the three part chorus (STB) anthems as they appear here, but Nos. 7-11 with four part (SATB) and five part (STTTB) choruses are available on the Chandos label with Christophers and the Sixteen - a four CD set.\n\nI've only sampled the rest. The Birthday Ode is OK despite some creaky vocalizing from an aging Deller, but the oboe concertos are pretty heavy going in their romanticized garb as compared to more recent period instrument offerings.","classification":4,"fold":7}

Overall, she took a step further within her voice, and tried to make a new step in her musical legacy. She went to Warner Brothers, and with the release The Light Of The Sun, she did come back with her song Shame with Eve, and it really did give her a new breath of fresh air in her songs and her musical dynasty. But trying to follow-up what made her brilliant, hasn't been a big leap for her with her Woman album. I found that some of the song didn't ignite the way that songs like Golden and A Long Walk did from her career. Fool's Gold, the lead from Woman wasn't actually a huge song for Jill. But still, it is better than the lackluster songs that she released the passed few years. It is alright, and at least it is better than the joke songs that Beyonce' and Rihanna have came out with.

The material is crisp, his delivery and timing are perfect, and his \"little voice of confused audience member\" thing is a genius idea that he uses to full effect. His wry accents and pregnant pauses are unbeatably tight.\n\nI love all of his dvds and cds, but DMT may be his funniest. [I will say, however, that I've never seen a comedian milk the same bits over and over on so many different cds. Nearly every bit he's ever done is on at least two and sometimes three or four different cds, providing less value than one might want. In that light, I'd recommend this, King Baby and Beyond The Pale, as they have almost every bit from his first four or so collections as well as new material.]\n\nNo other American comic seems as adept at pointing out our endless national foibles yet making them seem so endearingly moronic. Hot Pockets is pricelessly funny; I almost fall over laughing every time I hear it. In fact, to avoid that today I woke up and decide to start the week off right by laying in bed five minutes longer and listening to Hot Pockets on headphones. As usual I cracked up time and again, but was fortunately unable to fall over. I did roll over a few times though. Any comedian who can make me crack up time and again at the same bit is clearly doing something right. Bill Hicks and Carlin and Chris Rock can, and a very few others. Jim's in that small group, no doubt.\n\nGreat comedy is a combination of smart material, timing, and that x factor that separates the good from the great.

{"text":"The bane of \"Music Appreciation\" students everywhere is memorizing the titles of famous songs and the works they came from. The thirty-seconds per song that Amazon lets you hear on their preview pages are just about the length of time that you get on the final exam to identify the names of these songs.\n\nSo, if you have the money to spare (the price is better than right), buy this and other \"History of\" CD's. If you don't have the money to spare, you can still listen to the thirty-second snippets as often as you like for free, and use them to \"ace\" your \"Music Appreciation\" class.\n\nI highly recommend dthis \"History Course\" to you.\n\nJohn","classification":5,"fold":7}
{"text":"This British Band was formed in 1985 as a side project of guitarist Mike Rutherford of 'Genesis' fame. This song, released the same year, won some awards and a US Grammy nomination as far as I recall. I like the style and the musical flow of this tune. Yes, one can hear elements stemming from the 'Genesis' style, but different enough to make it unique. I always liked this song a lot. I still do.  The MP3 sound quality is satisfactory albeit not quite measuring up to the virtual Red Book format CD. For my purposes, however, it is plenty good.","classification":5,"fold":7}

I know every word to every song that ever was from her days in the 30's and 40's to present. She would rock me and sing to me until she lost her voice almost every day when I was a little girl. I titled her gift, \"Thank You For The Music Mom\" and THIS was the last song I added. She is gone now, and not a day goes by I don't want to pick up the phone for a nice long chat and lots of laughter.  I will always love and miss Mom and Dad.  They were a VERY special couple: wonderful parents, great friends,  funny, charming, popular, just plain great people and I thank them BOTH for the music, \"...for giving it to me\". Daddy played piano by ear, and so do I. I ask Echo to play it for me when I am missing them more than I think I can handle sometimes.

The material is crisp, his delivery and timing are perfect, and his \"little voice of confused audience member\" thing is a genius idea that he uses to full effect. His wry accents and pregnant pauses are unbeatably tight.\n\nI love all of his dvds and cds, but DMT may be his funniest. [I will say, however, that I've never seen a comedian milk the same bits over and over on so many different cds. Nearly every bit he's ever done is on at least two and sometimes three or four different cds, providing less value than one might want. In that light, I'd recommend this, King Baby and Beyond The Pale, as they have almost every bit from his first four or so collections as well as new material.]\n\nNo other American comic seems as adept at pointing out our endless national foibles yet making them seem so endearingly moronic. Hot Pockets is pricelessly funny; I almost fall over laughing every time I hear it. In fact, to avoid that today I woke up and decide to start the week off right by laying in bed five minutes longer and listening to Hot Pockets on headphones. As usual I cracked up time and again, but was fortunately unable to fall over. I did roll over a few times though. Any comedian who can make me crack up time and again at the same bit is clearly doing something right. Bill Hicks and Carlin and Chris Rock can, and a very few others. Jim's in that small group, no doubt.\n\nGreat comedy is a combination of smart material, timing, and that x factor that separates the good from the great. Gaffigan's defintiely got them all going on.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Alice Cooper-Zipper Catches Skin **1\/2\n\nThe way I look at most of Alice Coopers releases from the early to mid 1980's is the same way I look at Iggy Pop's work form the same time period. None of it is really horrible (at least not completely) but none of it is really great. They both seem to have like the whole new wave thing and wanted to join in on it. It didn't work out well for either of them. But what blows my mind is they were maybe the two most original front men in the history of rock n' roll and yet they wanted to do something...bad..? because lets be honest they must have been the only ones who thought the genre was going to last because once it stopped they both kept making new wave music.\n\n'Zorro's Ascent' 'No Baloney Homosapiens' 'I Like Girls' and 'Tag, Your It' are all decent rock tracks. They have typical Cooper charm in the lyrics. Especially 'No Baloney...' but none of them are worthy of the Alice Cooper name. Though 'Remarkably Insencire' is a real gem.\n\nThe rest of the album feels trite and boring, not to mention that Cooper sounds like he is bored with the music. The production for one thing is horrendous.\n\nWhile not too bad and not a total waste of your money, Zipper Catches Skin is not an album worth hunting down. IF you happen to come across it yeah it makes a cool snag, but ditch the high hopes for this one.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"Time Has Come Today was one of the first few songs I learned to play on my Silvertone electric guitar. It became a staple of my high school garage band that played around Virginia Beach in the late 60's and early 70's. So it should be no surprise that the driving beat of this notable call to action from the Chambers Brothers holds a special place for me.\n\nUnlike many of the songs and artists from those times I think this tune and their greater works have stood the test of time very well with those other artists we still hear broadcast. The message is still as applicable now as it was then. Time HAS come today.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"It has been a longtime since Matchbox Twenty has came out with new music. While Rob Thomas has had some solo success with Cradlesong and Her Diamonds a few years ago, we haven't really heard much of the group he and Matchbox Twenty made with music for nearly a few years. They have came back with their song She's So Mean from their 5th album, North. The song actually isn't a bad song. While it openly isn't as strong as their earlier songs, it still is honestly a better song than what had came out a few years ago. I really think this song is a nice welcome back for Matchbox Twenty, but I was hoping for better from them. Still, She's So Mean is definitely a better song than the jokes that have came out of the industry that have came out for the past several years.\n\nSong: B-","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Personally I've always been of the opinion that&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Magnification\/dp\/B00005NWMK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Magnification<\/a>&nbsp;is likely the album Yes were born to make. It embodied all of the positives that the band had to offer and few if any of the negatives. Honestly I happen to think that employing a full live orchestra was the best way to go for them in the end considering their heavily arranged approch to progressive rock. Well this album,coming a little over a decade after the last finds the band back with their more traditional keyboard sound. Interestingly enough it also finds them without mainstay Jon Anderson. That's one thing you can depend on with Yes for the past 42 years-the fact they can never seem to maintain a thoroughly consistant lineup. I must say,as good a singer as this Benoit David is he just doesn't quite possess the vocal power and personality of Anderson. Or it could just be I've gotton so used to hearing Yes with him onboard. Either way there are some important pluses and minuses to be found here.\n\n  Honestly the five part title suite doesn't really do much for me but without getting too personal I'll just explain what it is. Very keyboard\/lead guitar oriented symphonic progressive rock similar to what would be found on early 70's era Yes recordings. The most unique and musically attention grabbing portion of this suite would doubtless be \"Bumpy Ride\",which has that melodic scalling guitar\/wah wah peddle\/keyboard sound which gives it a bit of that might. The bulk of the individual songs have a greater strengh to them on their own. \"The Man You Always Wanted To Be\" is a bit melodically tenative for a poppier song but does the job well enough. The message oriented \"Hour Of Need\" and the instrumental \"Solitaire\" both showcase Yes's trademark folkier side and does that very well with some beautifully melodic pieces. \"Into The Storm\" ends the affair with a heavier straight on rockier number and that works pretty well too.\n\n  Overall it's an alright Yes album. Nothing truely terrible on it. Yet nothing that really stands out in a huge way. I suppose if you've been around as long and toured as extensively as Yes,your bound to continue to release more solid albums that truly ground breaking ones. And that's what this is: a solid record. One thing that's important to not,especially after seeing documentaries and reading about them that the core members of Yes but a lot of genuine musical knowledge and labor into what they do. Miles Davis once said that too many rock musicians \"didn't know anything about music,but were popular\". Yes manage to be one of those bands who have the advantage of being both. It's been both the source of their greatest praise and their greatest criticism. But the very fact that,even when the songs themselves tend to retreead themselves that the band still continue to maintain such a high level of musical quality really gives them a leg up in this regard.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"There is no question about Eminem, and the way he has grown noblely into his music with his last single. Not afraid really set a strong tone for his Recovery record, and delivered very well. But for his latest single, Love The Way You Lie, he chooses to turn it into a collaboration with Rihanna. Sadly, the two of them don't have a lot of strong chemistry together. Rihanna has mainly put herself to the side, while Eminem steals the spotlight on the song. I really didn't feel the chemistry on the song. She could've also brought more of her voice into the song just like she could've when she teamed up on Run This Town with Kanye West and Jay-Z. While Eminem handles well, I just feel that Rihanna could've brought more of her A-Game into this collaboration. Don't really love the way this lies.

Just about the entire song. And it occurred to me that besides it being the perfect song for this particular episode, Tommy James & the Shondells did a great job on this song. They were originally a 60s Top 40 band but in the late 60s put out what would be considered psychedelic rock. This song, however, captures a little bit of jazz, vocal harmonies, great keyboards, and an overall adult contemporary feel.

{"text":"Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\"; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson. We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic. Whether we are asleep with this beautiful song 'secreting' itself into our memory or 'relaxing' in our romantic, nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning, enrichment, and themes so present in this joyous, uplifting recording. \"Just send for me, oh baby.\"\n\n\"Remember the day I set you free\nI told you you could always count on me\nFrom that day on, I made a vow,\nI'll be there when you want me,\nSome way, some how.\n\n'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,\nAin't no valley low enough,\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you babe.\n\nMy love is alive\nWay down in my heart\nAlthough we are miles apart\nIf you ever need a helping hand,\nI'll be there on the double\nAs fast as I can.\nDon't you know that there\n\nAin't no mountain high enough,\nAin't no valley low enough,\nAin't no river wide enough\nTo keep me from getting to you babe.\"","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Tiffany still records music and performs live, but she will always be remembered for the hits that she recorded in the late eighties. This compilation covers the period 1987 to 1990 and includes all her British and American hits from that period, as well as several singles that failed to chart and one track that wasn't released as an A side single.\n\nThe album opens with Tiffany's biggest hit, I think we're alone now, which was a cover of a sixties song by Tommy James and the Shondells. Tiffany's version became a number one hit on both sides of the Atlantic; the original version had been a huge hit (but not a number one) in America, yet failed to chart in ?Britain. Tiffany's other American number one hit, Could've been, became a top five hit in Britain . Her gender-adapted cover of a Beatles song, I saw him standing there, became a top ten hit on both sides of the Atlantic. All those tracks originally appeared on Tiffany's eponymous debut album, together with Danny (her debut single that failed to chart) and Feelings of forever (a minor hit on both sides of the Atlantic). Both of those tracks are included here.\n\nTiffany's second album (Hold an old friend's heart) sold well enough without matching the success of its predecessor, but its singles were noticeably less successful. The first single from the album, All this time was a top ten hit in America and a minor hit in Britain. The follow-up, Radio romance, was a top twenty hit in Britain and a minor hit in America. It was to be Tiffany's last hit in the main pop charts in either country.\n\nThe music is in some ways typical pop music of the era, but while I don't like everything from that period by any means, I find this compilation very appealing. The most popular tracks here are also my favorites (though not necessarily in the same order). I have not followed Tiffany's subsequent career closely but I was pleased to see that in 2011, she released a country album, which I hope to hear one day. Meanwhile, this album reminds us of her brief period as a teenage pop star.","classification":5,"fold":7}

One of them is \"Nero\" [Track 7], which was recently used in the first trailer for the upcoming film adaptation of \"Anna Karenina\".  The music was perfectly utilized in that trailer, and proves that the music of Two Steps From Hell can have an even more powerful impact when put to images.\n\nA few of my other favorite tracks are \"Everlasting\" [Track 3] and \"Ironwing\" [Track 18], although there are many others that are unique as well and my favorites are always changing!\n\nYou get 26 tracks totaling over 70 minutes of music, so the album is really great value for the price.

Skip the album.\n\nIn the rock-and-roll canon, that great list of songs everyone generally agrees is great, you'll find a few Elvis, Stones and Beatles tunes. Zeppelin will have their share, and you'll see the Doors, Clapton, Buddy Holly and other familiar names repeated throughout that list. Then, somewhere close to #100 or 150, you'll see 'Iron Butterfly'. Who? It doesn't matter who. It matters what. The what is \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,\" a 17 minute work of rock-n-roll art.\n\nTo say Iron Butterfly was a one-hit wonder is only relating half of the story. This wasn't like \"People!\" whose cover of \"I Love You,\" hit high and then was forgotten when band members split to do other things. That's a real one-hit wonder. Iron Butterfly had one hit, but it would be like if Zeppelin only gave the world \"Stairway to Heaven.\" The one song is enough to seal them in rock-n-roll history.\n\nHas anyone covered this song? No one cares, because this is the version everyone wants. Everyone else is just giving this version an homage.\n\nLike Skynard's guitar in \"Freebird,\" the drum solo here is what everyone talks about. The physical endurance to carry it off, and the musical strength to sustain the rhythm back into the song is amazing.\n\nI fully recommend, \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,\" by Iron Butterfly.\n\nAnthony Trendl\nanthonytrendl.com","classification":5,"fold":7}

Definitely not!\n\nIf you believe that then you'll have to say that Eric Clapton sucks and is overrated because he copied B.B. King, Albert Collins, Freddie King, and countless others.  Why stop there?  B.B. King sucks because he copied Muddy Waters.  Muddy Waters sucks because he copied Robert Johnson and the other Delta Blues singers....etc, etc.  How about David Bowie?  He openly admits that nothing he does is original but he borrows from various influences and so does he suck and does that make \"Ziggy Stardust...Mars\" one of the rock classic albums of all time a bad album?\n\nAll music irrespective of genre is built upon the work of others and unless you totally and utterly rip off someone and infringe on copyright, you are building on something and eventually making it your own.  This album isn't overrated and every track is a genre standard.  15 years on, the only problem with this album is that it needs some remastering although I know Kurt himself wouldn't agree as he hated the polished sound and tried to remedy it with a very raw and yet awesome sounding \"In Utero\" but you can't really compare the 2 and they are both awesome in their own right i.e. you don't have to hate the one to like the other.\n\nI've already started seeing on more recent best of albums lists compiled by renowned music critics where this album is among the top 10 albums of all time along with albums by the Stones and the Beatles and I for one am not surprised.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Birthday, the third single from her album Prism isn't really a strong song. It feels like Katy has run out of ideas and voice. I really didn't find the song to hit the nail on the head.

{"text":"Pop music has long been known to be a wasteland of singers that either couldn't sing, or who could sing...but often with trite lyrics. However, over the years, there have been numerous acts that were willing to defy convention and make pop music that challenges those notions. Since the 70's, we've seen a plethora of acts take on pop music with great songwriting sensibilities (Billy Joel, Phil Collins and Scritti Politti being the most obvious examples). Joining that list is singer and songwriter Marina Diamandis - known to many as Marina And The Diamonds (The \"Diamonds\" being her fanbase and not her band). The Welsh-born singer moved to London, England in her pre-teen years where she found her passion for music at an all-girls school. Although not having a musical background didn't stop her, she later went to study music in college, but left shortly after she arrived. After getting nowhere with going to auditions to become a member of a pop group, Diamandis started composing her own material, learning how to play the piano and worked solely on her demos. That perseverance paid off, as she garnered attention from several record labels. However, she rejected offers from all but one when they wanted to have control over her image. She eventually signed with Elektra Entertainment for the release of her 2009 debut \"The Family Jewels\".\n\nIn 2012, she followed it up with her sophomore effort \"Electra Heart\". Although she worked with multiple producers on her previous effort, she decided to have a uniform sound. To accomplish that feat, she wanted to work with one producer for her next album. She produced her third album \"Froot\" with David Kosten - better known under his producer alias Faultline, who previously helmed all of the studio albums for fellow British singer\/multi-instrumentalist Bat For Lashes. On Marina's new album, she takes an introspective look at relationships be it happy, sad or confusing. She starts the album off with \"Happy\" where she desires inner peace. She issues seductive come-ons with the title track \"Froot\" and pleads for a lover to leave her after mistreating him on \"I'm A Ruin\". She also takes on a selfish stance by wanting to have one last romp with a soon to be ex on \"Blue\" and does some self-reflection on the hard rocker \"Forget\". She tells off a lover who think they knows what kind of person she is on \"Can't Pin Me Down\". On the 60's styled song \"Better Than That\", Marina shows off her bitter side by bringing out the claws by going after an ex's new girlfriend. She tries to get over old flames on \"Weeds\" and closes the album with the rumination on living eternally on \"Immortal\". \"Froot\" is a good album from Marina And The Diamonds. It's a mature effort that doesn't stray too far from her indie pop sound. Although the songwriting could have been improved a little, overall, it's an album still worth checking out.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"R&B singer Vivian Green returns with her fourth studio release (and second independently released)&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Green-Room\/dp\/B0096U8LH4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Green Room<\/a>&nbsp;on eOne.  The follow-up to 2010's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Beautiful\/dp\/B0039208LW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Beautiful<\/a>, Green Room finds Green in exceptional voice delivering a capable adult-contemporary R&B album that possesses enough modern cues to be relevant in the music world of 2012.  While Green Room is never necessarily flashy, it is consistent throughout its twelve tracks, making it one of the better R&B releases of 2012.\n\n\"Remedy\" opens the effort sporting solid production from Phoe Notes.  Green's vocals are clear and she receives an additional lift from background vocals on the solid refrain - \"There's never been a remedy quite like you baby\/you make me better better better...\" The bridge section provides some superb changes of orchestration, even if the progression is similar to the verses and chorus.  \"Remedy\" proves to be a sound way to open Green Room.\n\n\"Anything Out There\" is equally alluring, featuring contemporary drum programming while exhibiting a low-key vibe that has become the norm of the modern R&B movement (\"Wildest Dreams\" by Brandy, \"Thinkin' Bout You\" Frank Ocean, or even \"Adorn\" by Miguel).  \"Anything Out There\" may not strike everyone from the onset, but it is a cut that grows riper with each successive listen.\n\n\"X\" featuring Freestyle is easily one of Green Room's strongest selections.  While Freeway's rap is not necessary per-say, it takes nothing away as Green's cool, rasp `locks things down.' The chorus is brilliant (\"By a string, by a string, keep me hanging on...\") as is a bridge that differentiates the harmonic progression from the verses (\"And baby I recognize the need you still feel...\") Vivian's upper register is particularly notable.\n\n\"Free As A Bird\" has more soulful sensibility than the previous three cuts, proving perfect for Green's own soulful style.  A characteristic epitomized throughout the album is sound vocal production, which is particularly notable here.  Green's nuances and ad libs remain controlled and easily cut through the production. If anything, Green herself could've opened up even more.\n\n\"I'm Not Prepared,\" produced by Vidal Davis seems at first as if it is going to be an ill match for Green. Ultimately, \"I'm Not Prepared\" yields an adult contemporary R&B production with dance sensibilities that don't compromise the refined Green.  The cut is slated in that `cool, low key energy' approach, which bodes well for Green.\n\n\"Forever\" possesses a slightly slower tempo, but still has `pace' by all means.  The supporting vocals are quite present, carrying the chorus with Green's lead echoing the response (\"You are my life\/there's no life without you\/you love my life\/every single time...\") On the stronger \"Supposed To Be Mean,\" Steve McKie provides an excellent, lush production framework for Green to sing over.  There is little to trivialize here, but Green could've provided even more vocal intensity towards the end where things become a bit more static.\n\n\"When Can I See You Again\" is also produced by McKie and again, he delivers a nice production with plenty of soulful cues.  Background vocals remain in full employment and on the bridge, the change of harmonic progression adds an element of unpredictability which prevents any sense of the cut being `static' or just `sitting.'\n\n\"Still Here\" features Brian Culbertson and is co-arranged\/produced by Culbertson and Rex Rideout. Arguably the top cut of Green Room, everything seems to `fit into the pocket.' \"And you're still here, yes you're still here, and everything you said was true\/everything you promised\/everything you said would be,\" Green sings on the strong chorus.  Vocal production remains a plus and Green sounds best when she achieves some emotional vocal grit.\n\n\"Heaven\" continues the consistency of Green Room while the gospel-sensibility of penultimate cut \"Faith\" is undeniably emotional.  Closing cut \"Light The Universe\" features production from Adam Blackstone and features Algebra Blessett (she also co-writes alongside Blackstone and Green), Treena Ferebee, Leah Smith, and Laurin Talese. Kenny Shelton's B3 adds some soulfulness while Jamar Jones and the Millennial Symphony's strings add to the elegance and refined nature of \"Light the Universe.\"\n\nAll-in-all, Vivian Green doesn't miss a beat on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Green-Room\/dp\/B0096U8LH4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Green Room<\/a>.  No misses and all cuts enjoyable, Green Room makes the most out of the budge of an independent R&B album.  The production never sounds `cheap' as is the case often with indie urban releases and Green always sounds inspired and refined.  4 stars.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Opening the new Mudcrutch album is the vintage song Trailer, which like the rest of the album goes down easy, and is a whole lot of fun to dance to as summer begins to bloom.  There is nothing complicated here, nothing new ... and with all honesty, the best thing I can say with a true heart is that you're gonna get exactly what you expect.\n\nThere are light tinges of psychedelia ah-la The Byrds, and the rockabilly inspired Welcome to Hell,\" along with Victim of Circumstance, which is a sheer impersonation and inspiration of Bob Dylan; but then, weve all known for years that Tom and his band of gunslingers were never ashamed of turning in some Dylan-ish material.  On a whole, the album seems to be centered around memories ... new memories, old memories, and what were supposed to do with these memories as we continue to age and refine our lives.  Of course, its worth considering that by the time weve reached the age of the members of Mudcrutch, most of us will have seen and done it all, meaning that now its just a matter of seeing and finding joy in these same things through wiser eyes.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","classification":4,"fold":7}

Loved, loved the bell like tone of the piano, cello and violins in counterpoint. An unusual combination for sure, with a haunting melody to match, this is purity of music at its very zenith :-) The stateliness of \"Dines Waltz\" is sublime number with a very very calming influence on the mind. \"Faith\" with its English horn, violin, flute is an inventive melody with fantastic performances by the musicians all around. \"So Much To Say\" has a pensive feel to it and is perfect for the times when one wants to think quietly with no distractions :-) I absolutely loved the little flourishes Calandra produces on the piano in \" A Quiet Spark\". This is a lovely composition, brilliantly performed :-) Another track I want to mention here is \"The Dreamer\". What a track! It just transported me to a land of gorgeous soundscapes. Magnificent keyboard tones, and the violin solo was breathtaking. This album is so much more than just a collection of beautiful tracks, its music composition at its best! :-)","classification":5,"fold":7}

I heard the manager then reply \"can you please stop the music, it's scaring the customers and it's really bad for business.\"  I was so enthralled and fascinated at this point I had to find out why the store manager made that comment and why she was so insistant that they cut the cd off.  I went online later and listened to \"Happy Christmas\" and found out myself why.  It was truely awful.  I'm sorry I don't want to hear Jessica Simpson singing christmas carols when it sounds like she needed to blow her nose every song.  Jessica Simpson is just a strange creature.

{"text":"Twenty years ago, at the end of 1994, MTV counted down 100 music videos of 1994 and gave the number one video position to the song Basket Case by Green Day from the CD Dookie. I used a magnifying glass to study the picture art on the cover of the CD jewel case and found the caption: twisted dog sister. The blimp in the upper left corner of the picture on the CD cover has the message: BAD YEAR. The CD is round and does not have the entire message, but the art on the CD itself clearly has bombs that are called DOOKIE. This CD was released in 1994 during the transition from January to February, so MTV had many opportunities to play the song Basket Case during the year 1994, and I think a special thrill was beheld internally at the idea of giving myself the creeps and my mind plays tricks on me. Basket Case was the Martin Luther Stonehood of 1994 expressing itself in punk rock, and people who have forgotten are like Americans who lack Hegel circling the present with the depth of its past.","classification":5,"fold":7}

So much is made of their multi-instrumentation but you wouldn't know it from this. 'Oh My God Charlie Darwin' had 6 or seven fine songs and I don't think that they've bettered that album here.

C2C's is a very catchy song that I'm surprised didn't catch on a little more, likely owing to the band's relative obscurity.  So, for a relative soundalike, this one is taking off.  Good on Bruno for that.  \"Genius\" has got this song beat on low-end thrum, though; this pop gem could use a little bit more oomph on the bass end.\n\nThis is my old-guy bias, but I'm also hearing distinct tones of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Earth-Wind-and-Fire\/dp\/B00136NUG6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Earth, Wind and Fire<\/a>, all the way back to 1978 or so.  I'm getting that in the bass pops, the chord drops and the simple clapping backing the chorus.  This is not to say that this song sounds old or stale, but its roots are most definitely showing; it works for this song, and is a respectful nod to those who've come before.\n\nThis is a simple, easy, smooth and highly accessible song.  It's got an easy beat, not some relentless 120bpm club pounding, but a smooth rhythm perfect for dancing or singing along, and\/or both.\n\nMy one and only complaint is that this song doesn't even make three minutes.  Sure, it's a pop song and commercial radio play is still a medium for dissemination and moneymaking, but this jam should go at least five minutes, with an extended keyboard solo.  Why end such a good thing so quickly?  Let's hope for some remixes sometime soon that will remedy this.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"At thirty-six, Rick Ross is gaining popularity as oppose to his popularity waning.  His upcoming album is easily one of the years most anticipated.  Releasing another compilation from the Maybach Music Group is timely and just further adds to Ross and company's `cash flow.'  That said, 2012's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/MMG-Presents-Self-Made-Vol-2-Deluxe-Version-Explicit\/dp\/B008AC49YI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MMG Presents: Self Made, Vol. 2 (Deluxe Version) [Explicit<\/a>] is definitely no cash gimmick; there are more than enough solid cuts to make this compilation well organized.  The collective, comprised of Ross, Wale, Meek Mill, Gunplay, Omarion, and Stalley is quite talented where rhyming skill is concerned.  Add some brilliant production work from Lee Major, Beat Billionaire, Cardiak, and Rico Love among others, and Self Made 2 is quite strong.\n\nWhile the opener \"Power Circle\" is a mix-tape worthy juggernaut, it is one of the year's best rap tracks, easily.  Featuring no less than six verses, the gospel-hip-hop produced number is epic. Ross gets things started off giving quite the speech:  \"If Michael Jackson came alive right now, he'd ask you to smoke one for him, so in his honor.\" Ross then breaks into a short verse, followed by Gunplay, Stalley, Wale (\"...Cash rule the world - at least it do with girls\/at least it do with churches, seek the truth and true it hurts...\"), Meek Mill (\"I like to welcome you to the power circle\/clique full of real n--- that'll probably murk you\") and finally Kendrick Lamar (\"...I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms\/when they heard that Ohio State gave me 30 racks in July...\") A mini-novel could be written of \"Power Circle,\" a valedictory cut by all means.\n\n\"Black Magic,\" performed by Meek Mill featuring Rick Ross packs a punch with Yung Shun's malicious sounding production, not to mention the most clever hook of the affair: \"Poof! There go the Car\/Poof! There go the Crib!\/Poof! A hundred mil, David Copperfield...\" Meek Mill's rhymes on the verse are agile, but it's Rozay's impassioned hook that steals the show.  \"This Thing of Ours,\" performed by Wale & Omarion featuring Rick Ross & Nas features a more optimistic sound than the definitively southern \"Black Magic.\" While \"This Thing of Ours\" is slightly less edgy than the preceding cuts, it is solid and quite enjoyable.  Omarion's hook is a selling point for sure: \"This thing of ours\/it's so mafioso\/you ain't never know though\/never gon' know...\"\n\n\"All Birds\" may possess a silly hook, but it is as catchy as anything else.  Ross handles lead duties throughout, with French Montana handling the hook and the second verse.  The production helps to shape the cut, thanks to Beat Billionaire.  \"Actin' Up\" keeps up the consistency, with production shifting to Rico Love - always good for a lift to any album.  Wale & Meek Mill are assisted by French Montana on this solid, if explicit and repetitive cut. French Montana definitely manages some edgy lines.  \"Fountains of Youth\" finds Stalley in the lead spot, featuring Ross & Nipsey Hussle. Incorporating a brilliant sample of \"Voices for Sadness Theme\" (Franco Micalizzi), Cardiak's production is superb. Nipsey Hussle handles the hook capably: \"...Stained glass window in the Benzo\/lost in the instrumental\/keys got me sentimental...\" As for Stalley himself, his unique sounding voice and clever rhymes differentiate him from other rappers for sure.\n\n\"I Be Puttin' Off\" finds Boi-1da behind the boards with Wale featuring Wiz Khalifa, French Montana, and Roscoe Dash.  Ever the relevant hook, Roscoe Dash even manages to reference Instagram - now that's `gangsta.' The cut isn't bad, though a bit long and less inspired than the best.  \"The Zenith,\" performed by Wale & Stalley featuring Rick Ross is a `B', though does manage to yield different production work from other cuts (production is handled by Harry Fraud). \"M.I.A.,\" performed by Omarion and Wale atones easily, delivering a solid R&B number; Wale raps on the closing verse.\n\n\"Bag of Money\" is definitely solid, with Beat Billionaire's flashy production, and solid performances by Wale, Meek Mill, Rick Ross and T-Pain.  Ross handles the hook, assisted by T-Pain providing some sung reinforcement; the effects are positive.  Meek Mill even manages to quote Ross's epic hook as he raps - now that's loyalty.  \"Let's Talk,\" led by Omarion featuring Rick Ross contains a sample of Notorious's B.I.G.'s \"Big Papa.\" Solid through and through, Omarion delivers a capable vocal performance.  \"Black on Black,\" led by Gunplay featuring Ace Hood & Bun B features superb production, but comes off as lazy and too long ultimately.  The closing cuts \"Fluorescent Ink\" (Stalley, Wale & Rick Ross) and \"Bury Me A G\" (Ross\/T.I.) atone for any mishaps.  \"Fluorescent Ink\" yields some of Stalley's best while \"Bury Me A G\" finds Rick Ross on autopilot.\n\nOverall,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/MMG-Presents-Self-Made-Vol-2-Deluxe-Version-Explicit\/dp\/B008AC49YI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MMG Presents: Self Made, Vol. 2 (Deluxe Version) [Explicit<\/a>] is a great representation of the Maybach Music imprint.  There is a lot of talent on the roster and certainly plenty of `money' to be made.  There a few missteps here, making this a solid compilation overall.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"When it has came down to the greatness of Elton John, he has had so many remarkable songs that have still stood the test of time. What he had done with Bernie Taupin's lyrics, he has shown with the test of time that great songwriting can sincerely come from the heart. But it can also be a sincere memory of someone very important in life. That was the case with John Lennon, who was a close friend of his, which he trusted Elton as being the godfather to Sean Lennon, his only child with Yoko Ono. The song Empty Garden is very beautiful, and a dear poignant memory to the sadness of the day that John Lennon was tragically murdered in 1980. The song still is a portrait of the sadness we all still feel, with the death still a vivid sadness of a artist taken too soon. It is a great download to your music library, and for any die hard Elton John fan.\n\nSong: A-","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Gary Allan is one of the few saving graces left in country music.  In this day and age of auto-tuned superstars, it's nice to see a country rocker who likes it rough and imperfect.  Allan has already crafted two of the best country albums of modern times (SMOKE RINGS IN THE DARK and TOUGH ALL OVER), and every album he releases is a reason to rejoice.\n\nThat being said, for a Gary Allan record, GET OFF ON THE PAIN doesn't quite stand up.  It's good--note the 4 stars.  It's just not as good as it could've been.  There's genuine emotion behind such tunes as \"She Gets Me,\" \"Kiss Me When I'm Down,\" \"We Fly By Night,\" etc., but it never quite reaches the level it should.  Allan is in fine form throughout, whether he's rocking (the charging \"That Ain't Gonna Fly,\" the title track), or dipping into ballad territory (\"Today,\" \"No Regrets\").\n\nAllan and co-producers Mark Wright and Greg Droman lay the strings on a little too thick in spots; stellar songs such as \"I Think I've Had Enough\" and \"Today\" suffer to a degree from this.  There's a definite power pop\/rock leaning here, which isn't as bad a thing as it sounds--Allan has the heart, voice, and guts to pull it off.  It makes you kind of miss the honky-tonk of his first two releases, and the bluesy traditional country of SMOKE RINGS...but we're really splitting hairs here.  GET OFF ON THE PAIN is far from Allan's best, but damned if it isn't a heart-felt country\/rock record, far, far superior to what else is out there these days.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"It has really became clear to me that Jennifer Lopez has been one of the worst products that have came out the past decade. Not only for her own work, but she sadly has had some of the worst work for the past several years. While she might have pleased some from her On The 6 days, she had really taken her own turn for the worst, since her Love? album back in 2010, and she failed to ignite from her sound back in the late 90's. Now she is trying to be like the 90's all over again, and this love did cost a thing. It actually shows that she had not been able to ignite in the fire she says she is putting on. Ain't Your Mama feels more like a joke that she will never be able to ignite musically ever again. Jennifer Lopez really has showed again that she is a failure when making better choices in music to grow with her own sound. Just like Loubutons and Fresh Out The Oven, and her A.K.A. album which was a lemon, Jennifer Lopez doesn't want to grow up in her music, but stay a little girl in sound. She might not be your mama, but Jennifer Lopez isn't really good in music or career moves.\n\nSong: D-","classification":2,"fold":7}

Not much of a hard edge to this album at all, some songs are downright sugary. Don't get me wrong, enjoyable enough, but maybe a little too teenie-bopper.

{"text":"I always find it quite frustrating when a renowned singer\/songwriter releases a covers record, because you know that it going to be a least another year before you get a proper studio album & lets face it, Dylan properly hasn't many more records in him.\nSo what we hear with \"Shadows..\" is a intimate & really laid back record (although Dylan's vocals probably couldn't take anything too up tempo),with a bit of a country twang that couldn't  be more stripped down if  he tried, you can almost hear the chord changes.\nThe big plus for me is that they seem to be all obscure Sinatra tracks (I'm not a Sinatra fan), instead of filling the album with well known songs like \"New York New York\" & \"My Way\".  In fact the only songs that I've heard of are \"Lucky old sun\" which Johnny Cash & Brian Wilson covered & \"What'll I do\" that's used for the theme tune to the British Sitcom Birds of a feather (!).\nSo an admirable sentiment for Dylan to try & introduce Sinatra music to a new audience, but this is slight if enjoyable collections of songs from a artist who still has to energy & appetite to continually push his self & surprise his listeners.","classification":3,"fold":7}

Along with Teddy Riley, Tony! Toni! Ton&eacute;!, and Bell Biv Devoe, Sweat defined the forward-looking but history-mindful new jack sound that combined old-school aesthetics with hip-hop rhythms.

{"text":"Even though I didn't buy this album from amazon(sorry Amazon) I feel so compelled to write a review on this remarkable album. Anyone who reads the story of natalie grant's struggles coming into creating this album (not mandatory but recommended)knows that Natalie Grant is not content to just say 'its ok' and other Christian cliches that knowingly or unknowingly get thrown in for good measure to sell a song. She writes with such fervor and passion that it's hard to tell who's the songwriter and who's the character being sung about...they seem almost meshed into one. She has such a strong faith in Jesus and this album does a good job portraying that. The banjo style in the end song is one of my favs although 'closer to your heart' and of course the bombshell hit 'Hurricane' are very good as well. Amazon is saying this is the number 1 seller in christian music right now. No doubt whatsoever. It deserves it! When you choose to write songs straight from the heart instead of just conforming to the expectations of a 'good christian album' the results speak for itself. That's exactly what Natalie Grant has done here! If you want to hear an artist talk about struggles and yet the marvelous hope that is in Jesus Christ, don't hesitate on this one! Besides, you get to hear her do a duet with Gary Levox of Rascall Flatts; that alone is worth it!!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"If you're one of the moral minority with a healthy disdain for stock drum machine rhythms, sound-alike synth patches, and vocals that are compressed, de-essed, and auto-tuned to the point of emotional sterility, then dive right into Lake Street Dive.  Side Pony is the bands fifth release, another refinement of the bands original sound conceived by the quartet at the New England Conservatory and birthed in Boston.  No, this is not a hoity-toity recital of sterile adroitness.  Lake Street Dives chops rock a side pony (its a hairstyle) with doses of retro soul, R&B, jazz, rock, and Brill Building banter.  Vocalist Rachael Price belts out a fierce independence, and bandmates Mike McDuck Olson (guitar, Rhodes, and trumpet), Bridget Kearney (upright and electric bass), and Philadelphias Michael Calabrese (drums and percussion) answer in kind.  Its all in the key of fun.  The Motown echoes of Call Off Your Dogs, the wry laments of Mistakes, the ping-ponged guitars of Hell, Yeah, and the carefree confidence of the title track are each sound examples of how it used to be done before the machines took over the Top 40.  Lake Street Dive is Beantowns answer to Phillys Hall & Oates (whose Rich Girl they even covered on an earlier EP).  To paraphrase, because they rock a side pony, baby, they're just livin their life, because they rock a side pony.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Written before Daughtry left for American Idol semi-superstardom, this song was also used for the actual show, and made for the best goodbye song yet. Although the song has lost a little of its luster after going through the ugly radio cycle, the song still remains as good as ever with its touching lyrics, perfect vocals, great structure, and its build-up during the course of the song. In fact, the only thing that could top this song, is its acoustic version, which I believe was distributed by Wal-Mart. It perfects the song in amazing ways, and makes the song a real stunner with new depths of emotion. That version was quickly added to my long list of best songs of all time.\n\nSo overall, Daughtry's best song, and it deserves all its praise. Try to get the acoustic version if you can, but either way, its a great song that'll always be remembered for American Idol.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Rick is one of my all time favorite songwriters... I have no reason to be lackluster in any review unless it is how I really feel...\n\nThis is not a bad release.  Unfortunately, its not a good release either.  It's a solid \"ho hum\".  It's main problem is it and its songs is generally boring.  The songs are either slow or most are lacking in emotion.  Most are also very close to the originals in arrangement but a lesser finished product... in the way you hear when some studio band cranks out the top 40 hits \"as performed by ____\" that you used to see for $1.99 at department stores.  For me, it makes me think of the originals and why I like them better.  Broken Wings and Waiting For A Girl Like You are great songs originally... but they sound very similar here and in the case of WFAGLY, it was simply BETTER, with Lou Gramm singing it.  Unfortunately, there is not one cover here that I think is an improvement upon the original... (unlike how Rick made \"I've Done Everything For You\" and a few other covers through his career so much better than their originals).  Few here even get me remotely excited.  Here, the standout covers are Human and Baker Street (which is a lighter more heartfelt version than the one put out a few years ago by Foo Fighters).  The whole album is so lacking in intensity.  I know he intentionally chose songs that are mellow, but I just don't think that was wise and it makes for a release that is easy to file in your collection and forget.  There isn't any cover song except Baker Street that makes me want to hear it again.  Rick is a master of intensity in the right places... Shock Denial Anger Acceptance seemed to reiterate that point both to Rick and to the fans.  Had he done a cover CD with some more rocking tunes mixed in, I think it might have been at least more interesting if not downright good... this one just isn't and I can only hope this hasn't kept him from working on new songs for the next real CD.\n\nThe one gem on this release is Rick's own song Cry, and that alone really makes it worth something to the diehards (in addition to the fact that diehards will buy anything he does anyway).  It is a very good song that is emotional and has some great vocals upon it.  I find it only adds to my wish that Rick would have spent this time recording his own work than doing this!  Unless you have all other Rick albums already, you are better off putting your money into them than this album.  Especially be sure you have Shock Denial Anger Acceptance, Living In Oz, or Working Class Dog before even considering this one... those are Rick at his best.\n\n(Again, this isn't a bad CD... but Rick's real work is so superior and an average release for Rick isn't indicative of his abilities.  I'd hate to see someone buy this as their introduction to Rick and come away thinking he isn't all that good.)","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"Bettye is back with another album of classy soulful covers, this time produced by Craig Street, probably best known for his work on Norah Jones gazillion-selling \"Come Away with Me\" but he's also worked with Cassandra Wilson, k.d. lang, John Legend and Chris Whitley. This album carries on in the same style as her previous albums \"I've Got My Own Hell to Raise\" and \"Interpretations: The British Rock Songbook\" - stripped-down, sparse arrangements of various interesting songs that highlight Bettye's excellent world-weary, tortured voice.\n\nAs with the previous albums I think that this formula can wear a bit thin and that some covers work (Sly Stone's title track) while others don't (Beth Nielsen Chapman's \"Fair Enough\") and I still can't decide if Betty's re-write of Ewan MacColl's \"Dirty old town\" (transferred from Salford UK to Detroit USA) works or not. I thought that Dylan's \"Everything Is Broken\" was a bit predictable and that the Black Keys' \"I'm Not the One\" was a bit pedestrian but Gnarls Barkley's \"Crazy\" is transformed into a downhome blues (?!?) and the Savoy Brown Blues Band's \"I'm Tired\" is rescued from obsurity for a funky workout.

{"text":"Between extensive touring, befriending numerous other bands, and making their new full-length, this young, Orlando-based quartet have barely had a moment's rest since their exceptional breakthrough album, \"Ascendancy,\" arrived in stores in March of 2005. And to make life even more difficult, they decided to have the new album ready in time for a late 2006 release date (less than nineteen months after their previous effort was released). I don't know how they did it, but Trivium managed to find a way to write, rehearse, record and release the new record (entitled \"The Crusade\") in time, and they were even able to make it even better than \"Ascendancy\" (more unique, music-oriented, expansive, and complex). In fact, come year's end, it won't be at all surprising to see this C.D. near the top of more than a few \"Best Of 2006\" lists.\n\nEvery aspect of Trivium's music has matured and improved by leaps and bounds. In fact, instrumentally speaking, it doesn't get much better than this in metal nowadays. The guitarists stitch together gobs of unexpectedly excellent, professional riffs, strong, propulsive leads that evoke Metallica's heyday (somewhere around 1984's \"Ride The Lightning\" and 1986's \"Master of Puppets\"), and they even come up with an abundance of technical, ripping solos. The drummer (Travis Smith) is more remarkable, too, because his beats appear to be getting more complicated and energetic.\n\nTrivium's twenty-year-old frontman, Matt Heafy, probably saw that his band had made some significant improvements, so he, in turn, honed his own skills. His previous vocal style (prototypical metalcore yells) has been almost completely abandoned in favor of a new, low singing (almost crooning) voice that vividly brings the Metallica frontman (James Hatfield) to mind. Heafy also took time to become educated in and inspired by world events, and as a result, his lyrics on \"The Crusade\" are about a hundred times more intelligent, poignant, and thought-provoking. Several songs here take on political or taboo (and extremely morbid) subjects, such as governmental leaders and war (of course!), the spread of the AIDS virus, killing for honor, a nameless woman (Andrea Yates, maybe?) who takes her childrens' lives because she thinks they're possessed, Matthew Shephard's murder, being \"Hellbent\" on world domination, and police corruption (more specifically, the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo).\n\nBut perhaps what's most impressive about this record is that Trivium are capable of wearing their influences on their sleeves, but they never come across as a terribly unoriginal band. The music evokes thrash's glory days, but it also features a noticeable modern-sounding side (which is apparent in the acoustic mid-section of the opening track and the faint commercial appeal of songs like \"Contempt Breeds Contamination.\") As a whole, \"The Crusade\" sounds something like Metallica's guitar chops wrapped in (old) Testament's melody and topped off with Megadeth-style hooks (circa the \"Rust In Peace\" era).\n\nThe album opens with five killer cuts. The first two,  \"Ignition\" and \"Revelation,\" combine to produce a great, memorable one-two punch. Crunchy, punching riffs, pounding drum beats, and pulsating rhythms abound here, and the two songs also share five wailing guitar solos. \"Entrance of the Conflagration\" is an intense thrasher that bolsters fiery, dueling guitar leads with busy double bass work. Next, \"Anthem (We Are The Fire)\" is very impressive in how it builds and gains momentum. Much of it is occupied by busy riffing, thumping drums, a propulsive bass line that makes the listener wonder if Dave Ellefson secretly joined the band, and a catchy (though somewhat brief) call-and-response part. The song's climax, a series of mazey solos, is also quite cool. Lastly, \"Unrepentant\" keeps the energy flowing with forceful machine gun drums and more propulsive, twin guitar fireworks.\n\nThe next two tracks, \"And Sadness Will Sear\" and \"Becoming The Dragon,\" are fairly slow, but \"To The Rats,\" which is a breakneck roller-coaster ride of blistering riffs, kicks the album back into high gear. Track twelve, \"The Rising,\" is also of note for its laid back tempo, melodic leads, irresistibly catchy, lurching rhythm, and powerful, fist-pumping, softly chanting vocals. The lyrics to this song, which deal with unity and rioting, prove to be very inspiring and memorable (they might bounce around your head for a couple days).\n\nFinally, the last track, the title song, almost deserves its own review. It's an intricate, brilliantly written instrumental piece that symphonically intermingles numerous different tempos, moods, rhythms, and guitar styles (including fast leads, heavy and melodic riffs, a bass solo, and slow strumming). Some truly stellar musicianship is heard throughout this song, making it a perfect way to end the album.\n\nAt this point, you might have the impression that \"The Crusade\" is a flawless, timeless classic. Well, it's not -- not quite. One thing that it could have benefitted from is having at least one more explosive, unrestrained, attacking-the-jugular climax. Next, while these guitar solos are generally impressive, they're never very long (twenty seconds is as long they get). And finally, Trivium couldn't fully extinguish every metalcore cliche: the soaring chorus in \"This World Can't Tear Us Apart\" is sweet and heartfelt, but it's just too trite and unnecessary to work.\n\nIs it the next \"Master of Puppets?\" Nah. Is it even the best metal you'll hear this year? Probably not. But you can bet your bottom dollar that \"The Crusade\" is a great, entirely solid album (easily Trivium's best to date), and that it will probably be one of only a handful of \"metalcore\" era discs that you'll still be listening to in ten or even twenty years. It'll likely take several listens before you start hearing this album's genius, but a lot of great albums take time to fully appreciate. This is a realized, well-played, nearly epic release from a talented young band that's clearly just beginning to scratch the surface of its full potential.","classification":4,"fold":7}
{"text":"Khia is not one of my favorite arists for reasons not relevant to this post, but I like this song. It's a fun little line dance number with good syncopation and the dance itself is easy and enjoyable to do.\n\nIt is said by Flordians that I know (Khia is from Tampa) that the song's orgins are from an incident in a nightclub where an Asian male dancer known as \"Kang Wang\" was dancing in his own unique fashion in a club down there one night. Khia supposedly saw this and based the song and dance on Kang Wang's moves.

{"text":"The best studio albums have something to recommend about them: the artist and the mixers can make the recordings just as perfect as  possible - mixing the various tracks to blend perfectly, and editing and re-recording any mistakes.\n\nStill - live shows always have an appeal that can't be recreated in a studio.  Something about performing live, especially in front of an appreciative audience,  inspires musicians to heights that are difficult to reach in the more sterile recording studio.\n\nThat being said, \"Live\" albums are notorious for not quite capturing the experience of actually being at the concert.  James Taylor (Live), recorded during his Fall Tour of 1992, masterfully dodges limitations that  plague many recordings.\n\nFirst of all - the recordings are incredibly good, with the mix reflecting the notoriously talented and tight band that Mr. Taylor always has at his disposal.  A perfectionist universally respected in the biz, James Taylor is in a class all by himself among singer-songwriters: he can call upon enough talented musicians to flesh out TWO grammy-level bands, and while he gives everyone a place to shine within the structure of a concert, they all know that they are there to make James and his music sound as good as possible.\n\nSecond of all - this live concert, like an actual JT concert - is extremely generous in the amount of music available.  With two 15 song discs most of his best known songs (up to 1992) are splendidly represented.  Among the 30 tracks are one of my favorite renditions of \"Carolina in my Mind\", plus exceptional versions of \"Sweet Baby James\", \"Fire and Rain\", \"You've Got A Friend\", \"How Sweet It is\", \"Up On The Roof\", \"Something In The Way She Moves\" and many others.\n\nHe is also known for superb covers (thus his two recent projects consisting entirely of cover songs). It is an embarrassment of riches that perhaps the quintessential song writer blesses us with that velvety voice on other's songs as well.  In this project he gives an absolutely scintillating version of George Jones' classic \"She Thinks I Still Care\" and one of the best things about this live recording is listening to his introduction of the song - he says George Jones sings the song so well \"it makes you weep, makes your dog weep, and makes your roof leak.  It's pathetic!\"  Then he unleashes a version so good it would make George Jones weep tears of joy.\n\nIf you don't have any James Taylor in your collection - why not?  And if you're only going to have ONE in your collection... this wouldn't be a bad one.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Lately Ive had a great deal of success in finding large, outstanding compilations of classical music at the unbelievably low price of 99 cents. I recently acquired The Bach Guild's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Haydn-Symphonies-Box\/dp\/B013THM8PA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Haydn Symphonies Box<\/a>&nbsp;from Amazon.com, and I liked it so much I decided to add another one of the Big Box albums to my digital music collection. This time I chose the Big Mozart Box. It turned out to be an inspired choice.\n\nBig Mozart Box features nearly 14 hours of instrumental music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, all for only 99 cents. This superlative MP3 album contains an extraordinarily impressive array of music from a variety of sub-genres within the oeuvre of Mozarts music. Mozart is known to have composed over 600 works across a large spectrum of sub-genres during his short lifetime. Over 40 of his instrumental works appear in their entirety in Big Mozart Box. They include divertimenti, serenades, symphonies, string quartets, piano sonatas, overtures, fantasies, concertos for a variety of solo instruments, and others. Each clearly shows the depth and breadth of Mozarts incredibly inventive musical genius.\n\nThese are all superb performances from the mid-20th century. They feature various world-class orchestras, conductors, chamber ensembles, and solo instrumentalists, all of whom demonstrate the highest degree of artistry and musicianship in every performance. They do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama that Mozart infused into his music. Although these are mostly older stereophonic recordings (a few of them are monaural), the audio quality of the entire album is clean, crisp, and well-balanced.\n\nOf all the Big Box albums I have acquired thus far, I think Big Mozart Box is clearly the best. I listen to it constantly, and I am always highly entertained by it. Most highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"First up London Bridge Is Falling Down by Peter Bradley Adams. Simpering rendition of the nursery rhyme, not sure Mr Adams had to repeat the title quite so many times.\n\nTrack 2 is Barnaby Bright with Reverend's Son. Great clean female vocal dominating guitar and backing vocal on sophisticated folk song. Very nice.\n\nColin Devlin singing Refuge is next. Another great vocal and piano opening. The vocal stays while the backing music builds some tension with stronger piano and other instruments. Very nice Folk Rock song.\n\nTrack 4 is Kat Maslich Bode playing Sky Falls. Very cool female vocal over active band complimenting the song. Sound quality is not the best but the singer imposes her will over the song and brings us a brilliant somber track. This ain't Folk this is great.\n\nAnother Barnaby Bright song this one is The Stone. Same great female vocal, stronger band providing much more noise on another quality song.\n\nColin Devlin playing The Heart Won't Be Denied. Low key male vocal dominates this simple singer songwriter number. Nothing wrong with this. Sounds great.\n\nTrack 7 Kat Maslich Bode playing March. Slow female s\/sw feel to this song that allows Kat to showcase her voice as she ranges through powerful feelings in the lyrics. Another very nice song extended ending.\n\nPeter Bradley Adams with Full Moon Song closes this excellent Folk\/Rock\/Singer songwriter sampler from Mishara Music. Much better than the annoying London Bridge we opened with, Mr Adams picks his guitar and sings a very nice controlled mellow song. Competent unspectacular song although I note from Wikipedia he has already arrived, probably playing better songs than this.\n\nWindows Media Player codes the Genre of this free download as Rock, Amazon covers itself by listing Folk\/General, Rock\/General & Rock\/Singer-Songwriters. They are all right. There is no Hard Rock there are some very good slow ballads and a couple of singers with a lively band behind them. Every track is very good (except London Bridge, you may like it). Everyone should download the sampler for those quieter evenings or plane journeys, or delete and regret.\n\nMishara Music should pair tracks from the same artist (in my opinion) it works well on other samplers.

{"text":"Duck Rock from 1983 still sounds fresh and relevant. It's a brilliant fusion of world & roots music, scratch and sampling techniques, dance beats, pop hooks and rock riffs. The mainly instrumental Obatala opens the album on a moody mid-tempo note; based on a drumming style from the Dominican Republic, the languid track has snippets of a female vocal far in the background. Legba is similarly atmospheric but based on Cuban beats and purely instrumental whilst Buffalo Gals is an expertly arranged feast of samples, scratching, percolating rhythms and solo & massed vocals.\n\nFour songs are inspired by and employ musicians from South Africa, three from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Zulu\/dp\/B000000DXI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Zulu<\/a>&nbsp;culture and from the Shangaan (Tsonga). They are (1) the uptempo Double Dutch, one of the most melodious tracks with various forms of backing vocals (2) the fascinating hybrid Punk It Up, a song about&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Sex-Pistols\/dp\/B000002KIE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Sex Pistols<\/a>&nbsp;sung in English and Zulu with pennywhistles and gospel backing vocals, (3) the tuneful Jive My Baby Jive with its great interplay of male and female vocals and hypnotic beat. Shangaan township music is represented by (4) the buoyant Living on the Road in Soweto, an example of a popular style also present on Paul Simon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Graceland\/dp\/B0002EQ7E2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Graceland<\/a>.\n\nAnother one with a pronounced African influence is Song For Chango, a combination of chanting & Afro-Cuban rhythms. The fast-paced and polyrhythmic Merengue takes the listener back to the Dominican Republic, and is vaguely reminiscent of some of the styles that&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Kid-Creole-The-Coconuts\/dp\/B0000DG028\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kid Creole & The Coconuts<\/a>&nbsp;experimented with. Duck Rock concludes with Duck for the Oyster, a vibrant finale based on the Appalachian square dance with inspired fiddle playing. What makes it all the more charming and cohesive is the voice of a DJ and the callers that give it the lively feel of a radio show. Malcolm McLaren proves himself to be an excellent stylist on this innovative and well-produced album. Duck Rock is a joyful musical tour through Africa and the Caribbean.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Following the departure of guitarist\/co-founder Brian \"Head\" Welch in early 2005, Korn pressed on without him by releasing a fairly experimental new album called \"See You On The Other Side.\" The Bakersfield-bred nu-metal originators continued drawing attention to themselves as a four-piece by touring extensively, and even going so far as to appear on an episode of the TV show Monk. Then, when drummer David Silveria decided to take an indefinite leave of absence from the band in late 2006, Korn again rushed into the studio and recorded an even more experimental effort, \"Untitled,\" which was released in 2007. Now flash forward three more years later to 2010, and another new full-length, this one entitled \"Korn III: Remember Who You Are,\" is upon us. This is the band's first album recorded without losing an original member in more than five years. (Although they couldn't help but go through another lineup change, as \"Untitled\"'s drummer, Terry Bozzio, was replaced this time around by a guy named Ray Luzier.)\n\n\"R.W.Y.A.\" positively oozes with inspiration. For the duration of this eleven song, forty-four minute set, frontman Jonathan Davis wages war on his demons over his band's great, infectious riffs that will make your head sore from banging it too much. Meanwhile, Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu's bass is still as strong as a dachshund's jaw. However, unlike what was heard on \"Untitled,\" his bouncy, rubbery bass lines aren't used as a way of disguising how the band's rhythm section suffers from the absence of the Head. True, Korn's rhythm section may not be quite as strong as it was when they had two guitarists, but for the first time in over five years, it is now safe to say that they sound completely comfortable and even confident using only one. The result is, aside from an ominous intro track (\"Uber-Time\"), easily Korn's most brutal and riff-oriented offering since 2003's \"Take A Look In The Mirror.\"\n\nSongs like \"Uber-Time\" and the hit lead single \"Oildale (Leave Me Alone)\" boast pounding, staccato, serrated riff slices, and huge, irresistibly anthemic choruses. They both have noteworthy bass work, too -- Fieldy donates thundering bass lines to the former, and funky, slapped bass fills to the latter. Another one of the best tracks, \"Let The Guilt Go,\" with its amazing, massive, eminently memorable, and brutally pounding riffage -- seriously folks, this is some of Munky's nastiest riff work of all time! -- augmented by one of the absolute best and most memorable choruses Korn has written in quite some time, is a clear-cut choice for being the album's second single. And its neighbor, \"The Past,\" with its quiet verses which build well and seamlessly segue into huge, explosive choruses that will have mosh pits everywhere going berserk, seems to have \"hit single\" written all over it, too. The tune also features excellent, prominent bass work -- including an ominous, crunchy bass intro -- and noteworthy lyrics (i.e. \"Love without affection\/Is hate without the pain\") throughout.\n\nBut those aren't the only good songs! \"Move On\" and \"Never Around\" are perhaps the two most distinctly old-school Korn-esque tracks of the bunch. Both have great, lumbering -- and kind of trance-inducing -- riffs and memorable vocal patterns. (Jonathan offsets the choruses, which are accented by hauntingly melodic singing, with really guttural growls, vehement screams, and anguished howling. And, in the case of \"Never Around,\" some maniacal laughter rears its head, too.) And elsewhere, \"Pop A Pill\" is an exceptionally heavy, heads-down driving, and adherently groovy number with thunderously downtuned, mosh pit-ready guitars and Les Claypool-styled bass riffs. Similarly, \"Fear Is A Place To Live\" marries slamming, pounding, lock-step unison rhythms with great, staccato guitar hooks. And by adhering to a distorted, dissonant, and jagged guitar and bass riff, \"Lead The Parade\" is made a very powerful and booming song, albeit one with a slow, skin-crawling outro. And the record is rounded out by \"Are You Ready To Live?,\" which is similar to the tracks \"Move On\" and \"Never Around\" mentioned above in that it is a showcase for Davis's very impressive vocal range. He repeatedly builds from a creepy whisper to a full-throttle scream (and even tosses in some crazed, throaty, gargling vocals), over the course of this song's four-minute playing time. Getting right to the point, it is a quite killer vocal performance, and it compliments the band's patented heavy, punishing guitar and bass riffs perfectly.\n\nPerhaps the best thing about \"Remember Who You Are\" is that it sounds like a natural progression for Korn. Yes, it is one of the heaviest, rawest, and most viscerally satisfying recordings of their storied and influential career, but its heaviness and anger literally never sound uninspired or even forced. When all is said and done, what John Davis and Co. have delivered, here, is an album that is a standout in their discography, and easily their best and most infectious record since 2002's \"Untouchables.\" A fine effort all-around, indeed.","classification":5,"fold":7}

I can sing every song from the \"Supermodel of the World\" album by heart....\"Do you think you are fierce??\" \"Tell the man with the money to come here and pay me..\"\n\nSo here we are with \"Born Naked\" the latest from the Rupaul\/Lucian Piane series.  The first thing you instantly notice when comparing this album to the previous Piane collabs, is refinement and quality.  This album has just gone through a massive upgrade in style and sound.\n\nI don't necessarily like that the album opens with \"Freaky Money,\" but I look at it as a continuation almost.  This track sounds closest to that raw, unfinished quality the previous two Piane albums had so it almost makes sense to open with this as a gesture of closure and then to reveal the rest of the album which is polished and flawless.\n\nThe Dance-Floor ready bangerz are really exceptional:\nSissy That Walk - This really has potential to be the Supermodel of this era.  Stunning vocals, great beat and highly addictive.\nAdrenaline - Another fresh aggressive beat meets great vocals from Ru and Myah.  Think electro banger in the vein of LMFAO.\nFly Tonight - Sounds like pure top 40 dance r&b.  Think last few singles from Usher, Taio Cruz, etc.\nModern Love - Vocoded with that rock dance Daft Punk sound from the 2000's.\nDance With You - This one was heavily highlighted on the Rupaul show and is extremely catchy\/accessibly dance-pop.\n\nNon-Dance Tracks\nLet the Music Play - Cheesy lyrics but truly such an addictive track and just finely produced. LOVE this mid-tempo track.\nGeronimo - Love this trap\/twerk track with Ru rapping about bouncing your booty and Game of thrones and such.

Rupaul is crossing over beautifully into genres outside dance.\nBorn Naked - 80's pop rock and a rather unnecessary track on this album.\n\nAside from opener Freaky Money and closer Born Naked, this album is flawlessly executed, produced and delivered.

{"text":"If judging music is always an acquired taste, then how much more so for Bob Dylan's seasonal `Christmas in the Heart'?  I hear a clamor of dissent:  Naysayers believe that the Bard of Hibbing is overreaching into territory that is clearly not his.  I can only try to saw through the objections with some answers that counter the premise that this is not his album, nor is it the material he was meant to master.  However, after a sample listening of the C.D., if you still don't think it's your cup of rhyme, then leave it on the table for someone else to savor.  I think even Dylan, himself, will understand.\n\nIf you're reading this review, you most likely possess and treasure '<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Modern-Times\/dp\/B000GFLAI0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Modern Times<\/a>,' the latest and probably the best of Dylan's tri-Renaissance work.  Here on '...in the Heart' we have many of the same players:  Tony Garnier on bass and cello; George G. Receli on drums and percussion; and Donnie Herron, the virtuoso, plays on steel guitar, mandolin, violin, and trumpet.  And, just as significant, Jack Frost is still at the producing helm.\n\nFrost's production is impeccable:  The clarity of the music is crystal clear and emulates the desire that Dylan has consistently coveted throughout his career,  and I love the supporting voices that garner nearly every song without going mushy (say, in contrast to Phil Spector's controversial hand with The Beatles' \"The Long and Winding Road\").\n\nStill, many may find Dylan's voice unsuitable to the material.  For me, I've described his gravelly voice of late as being Leon Redbone`s successor, so many of the traditional numbers are given a rustic appeal other renditions lack.  \"Here Comes Santa Claus,\" \"Winter Wonderland,\" and \"Little Drummer Boy\" work in spades for me.\n\nThis isn't to say there isn't overreaching.  \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\" is meant to soar, and Dylan's voice doesn't muster what is necessary to carry it through.  With all due respect, I have a feeling that for some of you, my exceptions may prove your rule.\n\nClearly the best songs are lesser known works which are garnished by Bob Dylan's most excellent supporting band.  \"The Christmas Blues\" (Sammy Cahn & David Jack Holt) gives the dinner club jazz sensibilities inherent in 'Modern Times,' and \"Christmas Island\" (Lyle Moraine) competes with The Beach Boys' \"Melekalikimaka\".  Perhaps the best song, \"Must Be Santa,\" (William Fredericks and Hal Moore) incorporates what could be described as a ho-down at a Swiss Lodge.  It's highly festive and full of good humor.  If only all the songs could be this good, we'd have one of the great Christmas classics of all time.\n\nWhen one hears a C.D. throughout and cannot appreciate it after several listenings, then it's easy to dismiss.  I still haven't tired of 'A Christmas in the Heart,' which is still playing in the car, on the C.D. player, and in the I-Pod inside my head alongside the fondest of my most recent Christmas memories.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"This is an album for `everyman\", the definitive statement by Jackson Browne of his disturbing and apocalyptic view of contemporary society, and his hopes and fears for its future. It is also a lovely, stirring, and  evocative song cycle that illuminates Jackson Browne's unique vocal and  instrumental arrangements, and sends one running for the door to buy more  of the albums of the early \"JB\" variety. My personal favorites on this  wonderful album are \"Our Lady of the Well\", a interesting and fetching  suggestion of Browne's social and political concerns blended with a  celebration of the common rural peasantry of Latin America, \"Take It Easy\"  written with Glenn Frye of the Eagles and recorded by both Browne and the  Eagles, \"These Times You've Come\" about an old pair of lovers who still see  each other romantically after parting, and of course, the combination song  cycle of \"Sing My Songs\" and \"For Everyman\", which like \"The Deluge\" on  another album, sets out Browne's fear of a pending eco-disaster and  apocalypse. Browne is still around, still creative, and still as socially  and politically outspoken, but this is one of his best early albums, when  he was one of the most talented and creative young folk-rock luminaries on  the popular scene, a superstar a long time in the making.  This is a  `must-have' album for any real fan of Browne's music and for anyone just  interested in top-shelf folk-rock music by one of the seventies and  eighties greatest popular artists.","classification":5,"fold":7}

One of them was last year as winner of Dancing With The Stars. But musically, she hasn't really shown that she could sing more than she could chew. Her latest song Don't Hold Your Breath isn't really a song that feels exciting or well-displayed. She doesn't do enough to show that she can fully be seperated from her pussycat dolls days, and be taken more assertively as a solo act in the ways others' like Beyonce' have thrived. Nicole really needs to get something out to make it more of a \"wow factor.\" She said she will have something out soon, but honestly what she has shown is more of a snoozefest that makes it worth holding your breath.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":7}

The songs cover several genres including rap, country, blues, rock, and pop and they are all sung by various a capella groups. I enjoy almost all of the songs on this soundtrack but some of my favorites are the Winter Wonderland\/Here Comes Santa Claus medley by Anna Kendrick and Snoop Dogg and the Riff Off by the different a capella groups. I'm from Wisconsin so of course I am very interested in the songs sung by the Packers! The soundtrack is approximately 44 minutes in length so it's fairly short but it's packed full of excellent, fun, and catchy music. After hearing this soundtrack, I am very eager to see the movie.

{"text":"Bob Dylan sings Sinatra? What a preposterous idea!...\n\nas Im sure many music fans reacted when they heard that such a project was happening. Why would rocks most polarizing vocalist attempt songs made famous by the man who many consider to be pop musics best ever singer?\n\nPut those misgivings aside. Shadows in the Night isn't a cash-grab vanity project like Rod Stewarts Great American Songbook series; its a focused, carefully constructed and beautifully executed project that treats each song with genuine respect; Dylan puts his own touch on these classic songs without comprising the integrity of the original recordings.\n\nThe singing throughout Shadows in the Night is simply magnificent. Bobs voice is warm, lithe and has none of the gravelly sound fans have grown accustomed to over the last ten years or so. His phrasing is fantastic and each word of each lyric is as carefully considered as the last. This is the best Dylan has sounded on record in 20 years. Musically, the album is a revelation. Dylan and his musicians draw from the lush arrangements of Sinatra collaborators Nelson Riddle, Gordon Jenkins and others and strips them down to their barest elements, plumbing ballads like Im a Fool to Want You and Whatll I Do to unbearable, heartbreaking depths that would make Ol Blue Eyes both proud and a little jealous.\n\nAs for the song themselves? Wonderful selections across the board; Dylan made a smart move by not covering songs that are ubiquitous in the Sinatra catalog (Luck Be a Lady, Witchcraft, All the Way), instead opting for lesser known tracks largely culled from Franks legendary series of heartbreak records during his stint at Capitol in the 1950s. Several of these songs, including Where Are You, Whatll I Do, and Why Try to Change Me Now, are among the most beautiful and most underrated entries in the Great American Songbook.\n\nDo yourself a favor: dim the lights, pour yourself a glass of your favorite liquor, ease back into your bed or a reclining chair, and just listen to this record. It is a true work of beauty that begs repeated listens, and ranks comfortably among the best records of Dylans career.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"If you read my other reviews one thing should become very clear:\nI'm 100% old school...\n500 reviews on Amazon, and its rare for me to purchase or review anything made after the late '70s...\nand for a really good reason:  I think American music lost its vibe and groove with the advent of drum machines and digital music...\nGreat talent has emerged, but to me we've yet to escape the musical cheesiness of the '80s...\nan era where BIG and FAT went out...\nThen along came AMY...\n\nTrue, this album is RETRO... and Amy is not the first pop star to get big doing the retro thing (- - think B-52s, Brand New Heavies, Brian Setzer) however, I think Amy Winehouse is the first to really pay homage to the era in a convincing way... the music has an authentically convincing \"back then\" sound... yet at the same time... the attitude is truly NOW(!)  Winehouse has a voice that is a total throwback to the Pop and R&B divas of the '50s and 60's... but a persona perfectly fit for today's TV\/tabloid generation...\nin addition, her lyrics are engaging too... (A certain line in \"Me and Mr. Jones\" has just been entered into my book of all time classic lines...  Even though its Amy Winehouse, every time I hear it I go, \"Did she just say that???\")\n\nAs for the album,  as mentioned it is throwback to the sounds of '60s\/'70s AM hit radio...\nbut its done convincingly...\nAmy Winehouse has a voice that's thick and elastic...  Sort of Bette Midler attitude... but Della Reese\/Dinah Washington delivery...\nwith a hip hop mindset... which when juxtaposed with the old Girl Group Pop sound, definitely make an interesting listen.  - - In addition, you can listen to the music with a magnifying glass, and more and more \"substance beneath the surface\" becomes clear about her deep understanding of the roots of the music and her ability to express it in her own way.  Further, another strong point about the album that amazes me is that its a \"straight through\" listen... not just one hit and a bunch of fillers (as Phil Spector used to complain), but a whole album that's strong from start to finish... (also a gem of really great production and engineering to an extent that hasn't been heard in popular music for many many years!)\nOf note: If your idea of SOUL does NOT include the \"Mariah\" influence, you'll particular dig her singing...\n(I'm not trying to put down Mariah, but after 20 years, enough Mariah and Madonna already!)\n\nOf course, there is one problem:  her public image.\nLet's not be fooled... the words \"disgusting\" come to mind...  however, I sometimes wondering if its possible that she has a publicist who simply watched THE ROSE one time too many.. and is simply using shock tactics to market her... (I would really like to believe this as opposed to believing that she's yet another great talent on the road to self destruct.)\nActually watching videos on YOU TUBE, she seems a lot more together than many of the critics would have you believe and she definitely has an act that works...\nthe bands kinda dress throwback and she has the beehive... but then the tattoos, the piercings and the occasional obscenities... and subtle stuff the back up dancers do let you know she's a girl of this era... ultimately her attitude makes the music convincing as music that DOES indeed belong on the charts.\nin addition the band, arrangements and engineering are really convincing... some of the tunes do drag on a bit and lack dramatic build,  however, this is nitpicking...  it has been a long time since an artist has managed to present such tightly arranged and structured music to the listening public.\nfact is this:\nSomeone has finally come along to save modern music...\nher public image might be hard to stomach... however, fact is:\nMusic is back...","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"After early underground releases Nevermind exploded with this album on the backs of the excellent angsty hard rocker Teen Spirit - whose connection to Bostons More Than A Feeling has been well documented. Tapping into a vein of anti-hero, anti achievement misery that spoke volumes to the gen X slacker generation and promoted via an alternative couldn't-give-a-toss style reminiscent of the punk ethos the album was also blessed with evocative cover art that really caught the punters eye and was truly indicative of the sentiments contained within - and how often does that happen?\n\nThe entire package is well thought out, the production by Butch Vig and the band being adequate and while probably a product of it's budget more than anything else the fact that it suits the downhearted vibes so painfully evident in Kurt Cobains vocals actually works as a bonus. Other aspects of the construction of this album (see the Classic Albums release about this album if you possibly can - it's out on DVD) also speak of a well thought out plan. The megahit title track is the lead cut, then the mood is instantly dropped a couple of notches in the soupy thouth interesting In Bloom and the maudlin Come As You Are - three tracks that all have their own feel while still working in the same idiom. The guitar attack is insistant and the fuzzy style of it is so indicative of the underground movement, the punk movement and also the hard rock movement because given the heaviness of it this album wasn't going to convert people to liking hard music. No way, you pretty much had to already be predisposed to hard `n' heavy music to get into this.\n\nAs the album unfolds further we get the first of the lesser lights in Breed, which can be forgiven as it's followed by Lithium, another musically interesting tune that shambles along and uses the underlying vocal melody so indicative of much of what Kurt Cobain was about and is one of the tunes where his love of Beatlesque tunefulness is apparent. Polly, apparently one of the salient tracks of this album, has a couple of amusing couplets but ultimately always left me unmoved as it seems to me indicative of the shambling pointless side of the Cobains persona.\n\nTerritorial Pissings is anarcho-punk at it's best. The perfect song for when you want to listen to something incoherently angry. And if you've never felt that way your reading the wrong review!\n\nThe problem with this album becomes apparent at this point however as Drain You and Lounge Act are pretty anonymous. Stay Away has it's moments but isn't enough to pull side two (in oldspeak) out of the muck. On A Plain - well after listening to this album however many times over the years I still couldn't tell you what it sounds like. Not a great advert for the tune is it?\n\nSomething in the Way finishes the album off..... Eventually. And it evokes more of the same sort of anger-management-gone-wrong vibe of Territorial Pissings and the title track and as such must be rated a success.\n\nAll up in many respects this album is a success as art - something people such as myself who actually don't like the tunes much can still recognise as having some sort of purpose whether intended or accidental. It's also successful in that it's been seen as something of a watershed moment in the history of hard rock\/heavy metal and whether it floats your boat or not that's an achievement. And in terms of making lots of money for everyone involved it was also pretty darn successful (trust me - it's shifted a few units...). Potential downsides are that the constant pessimism can be grating, the attempts at arty rear and internal cover graphics smack of indie rubbish, full lyrics not included which is a pity given they were marketed as having a message and the fact that the sad ending to Kurt Cobains story may tinge your impressions of the album as you hear him rail against life and the universe. And each man alone must rage against his fate indeed....","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"With a trio of top quality singers ibcluding Miranda Lambert, this album, like its sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Annie-Up\/dp\/B00BSXXWIU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Annie Up<\/a>, sounds more country than what I've heard of Miranda's solo music so fareen conceived partly as a way for Miranda to record some recognizably country music while recording other nusic to satisfy her record label and the fans who buy her solo music. Am I being cynical? Maybe, but I enjoy her solo music even though I question its classification as country, whereas I have no hesitation in classifying the music of the Pistol Annies as country.\n\nSome of the songs are amusing including Trailer fir rent, which has some mild expletives in the lyrics. I generally prefer songwriters to avoid expletives of any kind, but they work well here.\n\nThis whole album is great from the opening Hell on heels to the closing Family feud.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Gotta have this in your collection folks. While the music is on point, the message is even more compelling. No if's and's or but's about it, we can do NOTHING without Jesus Christ. Try it and you'll definitely be back because it is in Him that we live, move and have our being. His love for us is unbeatable which is why we all need to accept His salvation in our lives TODAY!

{"text":"\"Mezzanine\" is another classic album by the legendary group Massive Attack, and I would even argue that it's better (there aren't any bad songs and the best songs here are simply extraordinary)! The best tracks are the first four songs which deliver a 1-2-3-4 of such creative genius that it'll instantly make you a fan. Sometimes relaxing, sometimes haunting, and always groovy, \"Mezzanine\" delivers a worthwhile follow-up to \"Blue Lines\" that \"Protection\" failed to be. Like \"Blue Lines\", \"Mezzanine\" features several singers who are ALL very likable and charismatic (\"Blue Lines\" suffered from the track \"One Love\" where the singer arguably kind of ruined the song). The lyrics aren't as memorable as on \"Blue Lines\", though, but you won't mind. Overall it's a much darker album than \"Blue Lines\" as it occasionally blends metal and industrial music with their trip-hop sound. Hip-hop and probably casual music fans will love this album. A word for the wise: the rest of the album might take a bit before you  realize how good it is. Anyways - very highly recommended along with their first album \"Blue Lines\" and Portishead's \"Portishead\" (though this one isn't as good).\n\nHighlights include:\nthe entire album!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Eleanor Friedberger comes off like a snazzier Melissa Etheridge on `My Mistakes', a song that has a lot going on and yet can't seem to find a real focus.  It's fun, but it grows weary before too long, a little frenzied in a controlled kind of way, just not controlled enough.  There are some interesting sounds and musical enhancements that add a layer of intrigue to the track, but they are compiled atop a rudimentary musical arrangement that gives Friedberger an almost dated feeling.  The horns at the end of the track are a nice touch, but they too don't really feel new or inspired.  They just serve to throw yet another trick in the bag.  It's decent and certainly has its moment, but overall this isn't as inspired as it is obviously trying to be.\n\nI can't say for certain that Eleanor wouldn't grow annoying after four or five tracks, but I'd be willing to give her a try.","classification":3,"fold":7}
{"text":"Not only did Wilco surprise everybody with the sudden release of new material in digital format, they made it free (for a limited time). What's sure to be a surprise to some fans as well, is the rather unpolished sound. There aren't songs with the level of polish found on recent efforts. For me, this is a welcome change, even if only temporary. It shows the band isn't willing to just settle and is willing to take risks still. Upon first listen this release will be a bit jarring for some, but I strongly urge those fans to give it many listens before passing final judgement.","classification":4,"fold":7}
{"text":"Leona Lewis has seemingly come out of nowhere to have the number one album and song in the world, and vocally, to me at least, she seems to trump Mariah, Celine, and all those 90's divas. And this song showcases that to the nth degree. Yep, like it or not, those days are making a comeback.\n\nThe song is an universally inspirational ballad, in the same vein of \"You Raise Me Up,\" and so many others, complete with huge chorus and finale. Taken from the famous poem I believe, Leona belts out the song in such unoriginal fashion, most people will have serious deja vu, but that won't stop them from eating it up. It could be a huge song on any number of radio formats, and it's the perfect world eating follow-up to \"Bleeding Love.\"\n\nOverall, if you love this type of song, this is about the best thing that's ever happened to you, it rivals Josh Groban, and if they play their cards right, it could dominate radio for years to come. As for me, I'm a little on the blah side, although it doesn't irk me as much as the 90's divas. Nope, Leona is better, and she could be the next big thing. Look out 90's divas, you have some much-needed competition.","classification":4,"fold":7}

Mild as the song might seem, it was actually banned by the BBC during the First Gulf War (1990-91) for its critique of nationalism and religious militarism.\n\nSo be dangerous, and sing out loud and proud, \"Swear Allegiance to The Flag\/Whatever Flag They Offer\/Never hint at what you really feel....\"","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"The title of this CD is misleading.  It is not the 2nd set from the earlier \"An Evening With the Allman Brothers-First Set\".\nIn 1989, the Allman Brothers reformed, adding Warren Haynes on guitar and Allen Woody on bass.  They recorded the studio albums \"Seven Turns\" and \"Shades of Two Worlds\".  Next came \"An Evening With the Allman Brothers\", which was recorded in 1991.  On the cover in little print, was written \"First Set\".  They then recorded the studio album \"Where It All Belongs\".  In 1994 they went on tour again, and released a CD from the tour called \"2nd Set\".\nThis CD is very good, but not quite as good as the \"First Set\".  The old songs are played in new and exciting ways.  The acoustic version of \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\", is very interesting (but not stunning).  The new songs are all very good.  The real show piece is \"Back To Where We Belong\".  It ends with a 15 minute version of \"Jessica\" that doesn't sound very much like \"Jessica\".  There is alot of jamming and playing around with bits of \"Mountain Jam\" thrown in.  There are no bad spots in the CD, but it doesn't have the continous intensity of the \"First Set\".\nNote that \"First Set\", \"2nd Set\" and \"Seven Turns\" can be bought together as low priced packaged set.\nAfter this CD, Haynes and Woody left the group to concentrate on their side project Gov't Mule.  Woody died last year and Haynes is now playing with Phil Lesh and Friends.  The Allman Brothers reformed once more, with Butch Trucks' nephew on guitar.  Dickie Betts has been temporarily kicked out of the band.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I've been a fan of Type O ever since I first heard \"Blood & Fire\" on my Mortal Kombat soundtrack cassette when I was 10. When Peter Steele died, I felt like I had just lost an uncle. But enough with the biography, let's get on to the review...\n\nI picked this album up when it first came out, and I honestly wasn't very impressed. I liked the fact that they had gone back to the long, complex song structures, but other than that, I really wasn't feeling it.\n\nRecently, I started throwing this album in more often and found myself loving it more and more. At this point, I would have to say that it's my favorite next to Slow Deep and Hard, and Bloody Kisses. Musically, this album is a complete success. Their maturity really shows, and the gothic Beatles-esque melodies that were absent from Life is Killing Me have returned.\n\nI would go so far to label these songs as \"beautiful\". With the exception of Halloween in Heaven (it's waaaay too cheesey), I would give these songs 9 and 10\/10 each. My absolute favorites are: September Sun, These Three Things, She Burned Me Down, and Hail and Farewell to Britain. I may even have to say this album is tied for 2nd place with Bloody Kisses only because this album flows better where BK was kind of all over the place stylistically.\n\nAll in all, this is a great swansong to Peter Steele's amazingly unique career. Buy this. Set aside an hour or so and listen to this album as a whole. Loudly, I might add. It will not disappoint.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"\"Musiqinthemagiq\" is a decent album collectively. I just turned it off feeling like it went in one ear and out the other; nothing jumped out at me or stayed with me. He still sounds good, using everything from the bass in his voice to his higher register, and the lyrics are still good, but there is nothing special per se'. Personally, I feel that he does better with slower songs. I am not impressed by many of his up-tempo tracks. For example, \"anything\" is one of the lackluster tracks on \"Musiqinthemagiq.\" Swizz Beats only makes things worse with his weak few bars. \"Single\" is one of the weaker moments on the album, it's okay though. \"Yes\" is one of my favorites especially because of the sweet words, fine delivery and jazzy vibe. \"Lovecontact\" has a 70s feel to it. It sounds like it could have been on \"The Way I See It\" by Raphael Saadiq.\n\nPretty good album, but I walked away feeling unfulfilled overall.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n1. \"Yes\"\n2. \"Lovecontact\"\n3. \"Waitingstill\"\n4. \"Backtowhere\"\n5. \"Medicine\"","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"There's no doubt that R. Kelly is in a class by himself when it comes to R&B music. I can still recall being twelve years old and slow dancing to Honey Love. R. Kelly has always had a central theme in his music which his sex, however every album is his catalog would always truly show his vocal talent.  After Chocolate Factory, R. Kelly began to release mediocre discs which would only have its share of good songs. This was most evident on Happy People , TP3 & Double Up and most recently Untitled. I almost wrote R. Kelly off as someone who would never reclaim me a diehard fan since or starters,  Kells is 44 and no one wants  to hear him singing auto tune. Now R. Kelly has released an album that I can let play from beginning to end. Love Letter is the type of album that R. Kelly should have started making a while ago.  Love Letter is the best R. Kelly album since Chocolate Factory and it features songs about love and not just sex.  As a matter of fact, the only sexual song on the disc is Taxi Cab which has more in common with The Greatest Show On Earth from Happy People then say Feelin On Ya Booty from TP2.  Two of the strongest ballads Radio Message & the lead single When A Woman Loves would make the late greats Sam Cooke, Luther Vandross and Marvin Gaye proud. While Love Letter, Number One Hit and Music Must Be A Lady just make you want to grab your lady and dance. I do wish that Kelly had included some of the outtakes from the aborted Loveland disc of 2002 such as Somethings Never Change, Kiss You In The Places & You Bring Me Joy. In addition  two of the strongest songs from Untitled disc, Religious & Elsewhere would be welcome on this disc. All in all this is a great album and along with the recently released  Eric Benet disc Lost In Time and 2008's Raphael Saadiq The Way I See It that pay tribute to R&B music. The only song I didn't care for was his cover of You Are Not Alone.

{"text":"Muse just keeps getting better and better with each album. \"Drones\" is co-produced by Robert \"Mutt\" Lange, which I must admit, I had my reservations about. He was a popular music producer in the '80s, but he lost credibility for me later in his career, but thankfully his \"studio magic\" is back in a big way with \"Drones\". This is STILL a Muse album so expect big and crazy guitars riffs, catchy melodies, and a nostalgic but modern sound. You can hear a little of that '80s nostalgia on \"Mercy\" (a haunting and deeply emotional mid-tempo track) and \"Dead Inside\" (a synth-heavy juggernaut about a broken relationship). There are some beautiful ballads like \"Aftermath\" and \"Drones\" (the harmonies are insane). \"The Globalist\" is a 10+ minute masterpiece. Probably the most experimental track. I love the whistling intro, piano riff, sound effects, and string arrangement. Matthew Bellamy's voice is still in fine form. HE CAN SING ANYTHING. His range is astounding and HUGE. A lot of people complained about the lyrics on \"Drones\" but I think they are good. Simple but good. The lyrics on \"Psycho\" are NOT terrible, they are very tongue-in-cheek. Bellamy doesn't take himself too seriously. It's good he has a sense of humor. \"Psycho\" is simply amazing but I could've done without the drill sergeant dialogue (too distracting). The verses are gorgeous and the hook is awesome. And that riff! Wow. \"Reapers\" is the BEST track. It's another song that has mind-blowing riffs. Bellamy puts his falsetto to good use on the chorus. Again, wow. \"Defector\" and \"The Handler\" are also hard-hitting tracks. Great arrangements and the chord changes are impressive. \"Revolt\" is a solid mid-tempo track. I like the message of the song. Very inspiring. Is there anything this band can't do? They are insanely talented. \"Drones\" is a concept album. Usually concept albums are a hit-or-miss for me, but \"Drones\" works because the theme and tone of the album is ever-present. This album is political but NOT in an obnoxious or self-righteous way. It's dark, edgy, and above all else, HIGHLY entertaining. BUY. THIS. ALBUM. NOW.  Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Whitechapel recently released their fourth studio album \"Whitechapel\" It's their first album since 2010's \"New Era of Corruption\" and first project since they released their \"Recorrupted\" EP back in November of last year. When they released Recorrupted it wasn't received well by their fan base. Most felt they were selling out because there was two dubstep remixes of two previously released songs. I found nothing wrong with it, I mean I'd rather have them experiment on a five song EP than a full album.\n\nWhitechapel still dips their toes in a few new things on this album, but it doesn't sound bad or forced. In my opinion I think the best way to mature and progress as a band is to try things in small doses and see how the fans react to it. A lot of bands just change their entire sound on an album, and it doesn't really work out in their favor. So I think Whitechapel did a very good job when it comes to experimenting with new elements.\n\nFrom the chilling piano at the start of \"Make It Bleed\" to the ending piano on \"Possibilities of an Impossible Existence\" this album is amazing. It's heavy, it's in your face, and it's just an overall great album. I recently played through their entire discography one day just so I can see how they've evolved as a band, and I must say if there's a band out there that's having trouble maturing their sound take notes from Whitechapel. Over the years the albums became less chaotic and started focusing on one specific sound throughout the entire album. Not only that, but Phil's vocals have became very crisp and a hell of a lot clearer than they were on \"The Somatic Defilement\"\n\nStandout Songs: '\"I, Dementia\" & \"Faces\"\n\nOverall Score: '8\/10 - This album is great, but I still felt like there was something missing. As I said they did a great job maturing their sound and Phil's vocals sound better than ever, but I feel there's something missing that makes the album amazing. If you're a fan of Whitechapel or deathcore then I highly recommend you check this out.","classification":4,"fold":7}

My next thought was, will I actually buy it? (Not my usual thought when I hear that Dylan has new music coming out.)  Finally, I thought, \"Yeah.  I'll buy it.  I'll listen to it once, maybe play it on Christmas, and that'll be it.\n\nBoy, was I wrong!\n\nI've already played this one through several times.  It is great!  The musicians play superbly, and Bob seems to be totally engaged in the music.  He sounds downright spritely on \"Here Comes Santa Claus,\" \"Winter Wonderland,\" and, especially, on \"Must Be Santa.\"  He delivers his versions of traditional Christmas hymns with reverence but without sounding dry.  Once again producing himself under his \"Jack Frost\" pseudonym, this may actually be his best self-production yet.  And, at 68, Bob keeps pushing that craggy voice of his to hit some high notes.  I find that in itself invigorating.\n\n\"Christmas in the Heart\" is a very good Christmas album, and a mighty fine addition to the formidable Dylan catalog.  I'm no longer concerned that I'll only play it once; now, I'm concerned that I'll wear it out before Christmas.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"A great album from a great Detroit soul singer and the word \"thankful\" doesn't come close. Bettye LaVette is one of those singers who like Mavis Staples has never quite garnered the respect she deserves. She is lauded in critical circles and by lovers of soul, has paid her dues and then some; but the world is a cruel place and as more below par warblers are inflicted upon us in programmes like the X factor, true talent is sidelined. Bettye LaVette celebrates her 50th anniversary in the music business this year and it has seen her tour with the premier division of rhythm and blues musicians such Clyde McPhatter, Ben E. King, Barbara Lynn and Otis Redding. Her past is very colourful and her recently published autobiography \"A Woman like me\" is understood to be a salty good read.\n\nOn \"Thankful n Thoughtful\" she produces an album which you listen to in marvel. That voice could sing the menu down the local Tandoori house and make you weep, just check out the two covers of Ewan MacColl's \"Dirty old town\" one very soulful the other so full of emotion its almost impossible to get that lump out of your throat. Her version of Neil Young's \"Everyone knows this is nowhere\" takes Shakey's plaintive country rock and infuses it with a passion that you never thought possible. Equally she turns Gnarls Barkley's pumping dance anthem \"Crazy\" into a haunting raw blues song that you should really seek out as a matter of urgency. Other great covers of the Black Keys \"Im not the one\", Patty Griffin's lovely \"\"Time will do the talking\" and Bob Dylan's \"Everything is broken\" are included and amply demonstrate the sheer versatility of an artist who has seen and done it all. However it is her New Orleans music hall version of Tom Waits \"Yesterday is here\" that steals the show. The late night bar stool philosophies and heartaches of Waits are the perfect backdrop for the hurt in LaVette's voice and she really should undertake a whole album of Waits covers and send that young Scarlett Johansson off with a flea in her ear. Why not take a punt and as we approach Christmas before your cursor hovers over the Amazon \"add to basket\" on artists like Emeli Sande or Adele go to the source of the river instead and honour one of the best women singers alive today.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"The Fray is one of those contemporary soft-rock groups that show that that genre's stereotype of being slow and dull need not always apply.  \"Over My Head (Cable Car)\" describes lead singer, Isaac Slade's, contentious relationship with his older brother Caleb (nicknamed `cable car').  In the music video for \"Over My Head\", Isaac plays the role of his older brother, while his real life younger brother, Micah, portrays Isaac.  The lyrics are very relatable and that type of connection to a song gives it tremendous staying power.","classification":5,"fold":7}

I look forward to another stand up show from this ultra talented young man. Donald Glover covered almost all current topics, from racial issues, family memories over a smore chocolate, and the meaning of the word nigglet! Lol. You will not be disappointed with this stellar comedy show. I like his calm demeanor and voice impressions too. Most people know Donald Glover from either the critically acclaimed show \"30 Rock\", or you may know him from his rap career under the name of Childish Gambino. Honestly watching this comedy stand up \"weirdo\" is the first time I have ever heard of him(Donald Glover). I recently checked out his rap albums \"Because the internet\" and \"Royalty\". I must say I was thoroughly impressed with Donald Glover aka Childish Gambino's music. Versatile, witty, and funny beyond measure, Donald Glover's is a truly talented weirdo for sure. Check this entertaining show out and laugh your butt off.  Peace","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Wow!  There's sooooo... much to like in this album it's amazing.  The music is mostly upbeat & very catchy--making you want to (& will if no one's around) sing along.  The lyrics are fine, meaningful, & personally touching--about life which is getting faster & faster in the contemporary world, while people are still people with hopes, feelings, needs, desires, & all the rest of what makes people human.  The lead singer, Jennifer Nettles is powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice (though a bit twangy in style).  She grabs you quickly for a wild ride--immersing the listener in the musical story she's telling.  I bought the CD based on hearing Baby Girl & Something More (on the TV show Vegas of all place).  Then I heard Sugarland on the CMA show--winning awards as they so deserve.  The range & variety of the songs on the album are good too--from sweet & poignant ballads to wild & spicy soaring.  Virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to & the majority could become successful singles.  Yes, the style is their own mixture of influences--the 3 artists come from different musical backgrounds, which makes their wonderful blending are the more impressive.  And, the trio wrote all the songs on the CD--with Hall the primary author (solo writer on one of them).  How many trios are there with 2 women & 1 man?  I wonder if they are unique?  Well, they are unique even if not in that respect--how many bands include a mandolin?.  Of course, country purists may not be happy with them, but the vast majority of listeners ARE.  This has become one of my favorite albums, at the speed of sound.  IMHO, it's terrific.","classification":5,"fold":7}

However, both also do suffer from a hard flow that sometimes does not go over their beats well.\n\nJones' album suffers from an uneven flow, and his track beats are a little weak in my opinion. I was not eye-popped by any of the tracks on this album; they were all listenable and ok. The best of the bunch were Your City, Kingdom Figures and WOG, but Mouthpiece and Bizzle really bailed the first two songs out.\n\nOverall this project was ok. If you really like Christian Hip Hop, you can pick it up. Maybe it will sound better to you, like it did for these other reviewers.

{"text":"One of the most consummate storytellers of the last 40+ years, James Taylor has also remained a dynamic and charismatic onstage performer. While he isn't as visually exciting or physically demanding as many of his piers, his shows have an intimacy that few performers are able to capture.\n\nThe two disc 1993 release offers an excellent sampling of Taylor's tour from that year. The song selections could not be more perfect, offering his biggest hit singles (\"Fire and Rain,\" \"You've Got a Friend,\" \"How Sweet It Is,\" \"Handy Man\"), beloved fan favorites (\"Sweet Baby James,\" \"Something in the Way She Moves,\" \"Carolina in My Mind,\" \"Country Road\"), obscure album cuts (\"Traffic Jam,\" \"Secret O' Life,\" \"Millworker,\" \"That Lonesome Road\"), and several cuts from his most recent efforts.

{"text":"Dear Music Appreciators,\n\nIf you don't know who Richard Thompson is for some reason, then Ill start by saying this - if you're looking for pretty vocals you might want to look elsewhere.  For pretty vocals from a singer\/songwriter with the last name Thompson, look up Teddy Thompson, Richard Thompsons son,  who sometimes plays and records with his dad and is an accomplished singer\/songwriter in his own right.  Teddy is the type of singer whose voice is familiar with the adjective golden.  His father, Richard, is a much more, shall I say, \"human singer.  Fortunately Richard is a guitar wizard and a first-rate songwriter.  He is also a witty and wizened old folkie from the sixties, who is now in HIS sixties, but who remains in full command of his guitar playing and songwriting powers on this, his 42nd album, titled STILL.\n\nAbout half of this album had to grow on me, and about half was instantly appealing, which is actually a nice balance.  Enough low hanging fruit to attract me to the tree and keep me there long enough to notice something desirable is also growing in the upper branches.\n\nAnd now, without further ado, I present:\n\nCONSTANT LISTENERS ALBUM OPINION AWARDS for STILL by Richard Thompson\n\nMost quickly addictive guitar hook = Long John Silver, though \"Beatnik Walking and No Peace, No End are pretty great too...\n\nPrettiest acoustic guitar work = Josephine\"\n\nLeast likably sung word = the word doll on Broken Doll, (nearly a tie with the word hand on Dungeons for Eyes)\n\nBest autobiographical story song = Guitar Heroes\"\n\nGreatest variety of musical styles in one song = Guitar Heroes\"\n\nSong most likely to be skipped over by me = Dungeons for Eyes\"\n\nSong I initially didn't care for that began to grow on me the most = Wheres Your Heart\"\n\nMusic that most reminded me of music from another song by another artist = opening guitar on Beatnik Walking \/ Solsbury Hill by Peter Gabriel\n\nMost noteworthy guitar soloing = Patty Dont You Put Me Down for the tumbling and trips and bends.  Well, lets call it a tie with Shes All Buttoned Up.  Wait, what about Pony in the Stable? And what about the epic, unravelling chimey-ness of She Never Could Resist a Winding Road?  Oh man, Long John Silver is really cool too - how that electric guitar digs low and then sprouts another personality about 3\/4 through...\n\nBest singing with a British accent = She Never Could Resist a Winding Road I didn't like it at first, but this is nice to hear actually - so many singers don't sing with much trace of their native accent, as if they're playing the part of an American pop singeror maybe it has something to do with how the mouth works singing vs. talking - I don't know - whatever the reason, it feels true and authentic to hear some accent in there...\n\nI imagine fans of Richard Thompson will find plenty to enjoy on STILL, and for those who may be new to his world, if you like folk, rock, virtuoso guitar work (both acoustic and electric), acerbic wit, failed relationships, English nostalgia and romance, songs about pirate con men...and 1960s recording artists who have influenced hordes of contemporary musicians and who've still got it after all these years, then this latest offering from Richard Thompson might just be your cup of tea.\n\nPsst...Wilco fans, this ones produced by Jeff Tweedy.\n\nSincerely,\n\nConstant Listener","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I TITLED THIS FEARLESS BECAUSE TAYLOR STEPPED OUT OF HER SAFELY ZONE AND WHILE SHE DIDN'T HIT A HOME RUN THIS CD DID NOT FALL FLAT EITHER, FAR FROM IT. Definitely, I will begin by saying Fearless and Speak Now are far better cd's than Red.  But that being said, we are still talking about a remarkable artist and Red is still a true accomplishment. At first, I was flipping frantically from song to song wondering where did Taylor go?!  But after my initial breakdown I listened carefully to this cd and I give it five stars on its on merit apart from anything else.  I think the best cd's like Fearless and Speak Now are the type that you don't need to get used to; that you know from the first second you hear it, it's amazing.  With Red, every listen gets better; songs are discovered that are even brilliant.  I think Sad Beautiful Tragic is one of the best and most haunting love songs I ever heard.  I love The Lucky One and it's insurmountable message not so much for famous people like Taylor Swift who has kept a level head all her life but more like Kurt Cobain or Janis Joplin or in recent times Britney Spears or Amy Winehouse.  Sometimes the lucky ones are those that break away from a fame that is destroying them.  Anyway, I look forward to finding new depths every time I listen to this CD over again; and I also look forward to Taylor's next CD which I hope will return back to her roots.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"If you need to fill holes in your Grieg collection, or you're looking to replace that lost or broken CD.  Or, if you've never bought a Grieg CD or MP3, then this is the collection for you - at $1.99 you can hardly go wrong.  You can't beat the price with a stick and you get hours and hours of quality music by one of the greatest Scandanavian composers of all time. Of course, all the standards are here, from the Peer Gynt Suite we have Anitra's Danse and In the Hall of the Mountain King.  In fact, the entire Peer Gynt Suite is here.  Others include The Holberg Suite, 6 poems by Henrik Ibsen set to music, various lyric pieces and sonatas, Norwegian, Symphonic and peasant dances,  Sigurd Josalfar amongst others.  Grieg has a national identity and strength to his music that harkens back to the myths and legends of his home country.  This is music at it's best!  Grieg was clearly a genius, and it shows on the tracks on this MP3 download.  Use it for singing and dancing, or as the background for your life.  It's strong and  beautiful!\n\nFOR THE MUSIC PURISTS:  Use this to fill holes in your collection - it's so cheap, it's almost like stealing.  There's so much here that you can't go wrong, even if some aren't perfectly executed.\n\nFOR EVERYONE ELSE: Use this to build your collection.  There are at least 8 other MP3 downloads like this one which would start the basis for a lovely classical music library. If you get to the point where a piece doesn't sound right, or bothers you in any way, go out and explore alternatives.  There are tons out there.  What I like, you may not, and vice versa.  For example, the only people I like play Rachmaninoff are Rachmaninoff and Mischa Dikter.  Yet, I'm told a lot of people play him well - I just don't agree.  It's all personal taste.  Take recommendations, but figure out what you like yourself.\n\n At $1.99 each, that makes it under $18.00 to have 1800 tracks of 9 classical masters, ranging from Bach to Debussey.  You can't even buy a family of 4 fastfood for that little.  Or you could buy 18 tracks on i-tunes, not 1800.  I can tell you, I did it, and it's been the soundtrack to the greater part of my life since I did so.  It especially makes wonderful background music while reading anything from fiction to nonfiction - and of course making dinner.  You can't beat this deal - just buy this!  Buy all of them!

{"text":"This debut from New York's southside Jamica, Queens crew led by Mr. Cheeks has made boyz with their hustlin', partying, street grooves on Legal Drug Money.  With memerable, catchy hooks and freestyle rhymes the Lost Boyz had themselves an almost classic.  Their party, upbeat joints like \"Music Makes Me High\" and \"Get Up\"  are what makes this such a hot commodity.  On the other end of the spectrum we have \"Renee\".  This is a song mourning over a death.  Besides, Mr. Cheeks uses the word love and keeps it raw and hardcore.  Member Freaky Tah also represented on here with Mr. Cheeks and with a solo song, \"1,2,3\".  Going back to their most obvious freestyle flow, listen to the two of them on \"All Right\".

{"text":"I normally despise remakes of my favorite songs.  Invariably, they lose something of the charm of the original when updated and translated to a modern musician's style.  Whether it's Madonna remaking Don McLean's \"American Pie,\" Destiny's Child remaking Roberta Flack's \"Killing Me Softly With His Song,\" or the Dixie Chicks' remaking Fleetwood Mac's \"Landslide,\" it always feels to me like the new versions are little more than watered-down copies of the originals, annoying at best and downright soulless at worst.  So when a video of Simon and Garfunkle's classic \"Sound of Silence\" being performed by metal\/rock band Disturbed began circulating on Facebook, I braced myself for the worst.  The only thing worse than a modern remake of \"Sound of Silence,\" I thought, would be a metal cover of it.\n\nI was blown away.  No, Disturbed's version of \"Sound of Silence\" doesn't have the same tone and quiet thoughtfulness of Simon and Garfunkle's song.  But instead of giving us a weak copy, Disturbed gives us something powerful and resonant, a cover that is unique and excellent, even masterful, in its own right.\n\n\"Sound of Silence\" is a slow, melancholy ballad, but while S&G made it thoughtful and wistful, Disturbed infuses it with a great sense of sadness and even rage that slowly builds to an ultimately hopeful crescendo.  It makes for a haunting, yet in the end thrilling, listening experience.  The singer's voice struggles a bit with some of the higher notes but otherwise has a rich and even gorgeous tone, carrying a great deal of emotion as he sings.  And despite Disturbed being mostly known for harder stuff like metal and hard rock, they don't spoil this cover with unnecessary guitar riffs or drum-bashing -- the instrumentation is mostly subdued and provides haunting accompaniment, though it apes the singer by building to a thundering, powerful crescendo in the end.  A good song has singer and accompaniment working together rather than fighting one another, and \"Sound of Silence\" delivers.\n\nDisturbed didn't change a single lyric of the song in the process of covering it, which I greatly appreciate.  Sometimes covers take advantage of the song they're remaking by altering the lyrics, and this rarely works out for the best in my mind.  Disturbed made a good call by keeping all the original lyrics in place -- their message of a society where people are afraid to speak out or listen to the ugly but necessary truth is still resonant today, and is a message that needs heard now more than ever.\n\nI still love Simon and Garfunkle's version of this song... but Disturbed's cover is amazing, and one of the few song covers that I would call just as good as the original.  Disturbed takes a well-known and well-loved song and makes it their own without weakening it at all, and I highly recommend it even to those who aren't fond of the band or their style of music.  You won't be disappointed.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Sorry, can't really articulate any other word or \"ism\" to describe my feelings abot this and the other live track, \"After The Love Is Gone.\"  The latter isn't a Chicago song at all and is present on this collection because of Bill Champlin. I would have liked to see unedited versions of the \"singles\" on this collection but we are dealing with Rhino, the edit kings.

She though has tried to hit that nail on the head with her voice with We Can't Stop from her upcoming record Bangerz, which was blah and not anything to rave about. Wrecking Ball fares a bit better trying to get her voice into a spin similar to what Demi Levoto did with Skyscraper a few years ago. The song isn't a bad song, yet it is no The Climb. Still, it is better than what has been coming out from Miley and also what radio has had for the past year.

{"text":"Well, I LOVE this collection.  Saying that, this is not an album for everyone.  This is a collection for the fan of early music, and true folk songs (as opposed to the Kingston Trio variety).  Selections are mostly played on the lute, and the primary singer is one of the 20th century's leading counter tenors.  If you don't know what a counter tenor is, I suspect this may not be your cup of tea.  If, however, you are prepared and knowledgeable (or are just adventurous), this is one of the biggest values for excellent music I've ever seen.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I heard this song late (not a big fan of top 40s radio), so it was already long popular before I even knew about it, but when I did hear it, it stuck, partially for the lounge room blues sound from the early 1960s, and partially because it reminded me of all of the people that I used to know; people that I once called friends, but now have no idea where they are. Sad to think of all of the people that used to be part of my life, but now may be gone forever, but that's what a song like this should do: make you remember what was, and make you think about what might have been.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"To some R&B is dead music field in the mainstream, however there are some singers ,Eric Roberson & Kem to name a few who are still delivering classic albums. On his fourth album in his six year solo career, Bobby V (previously known as Bobby Valentino) shows his growth not only as artist vocally but his maturity as well. From wearing jeans and a t-shirt on his first album, Bobby is now rocking a suit like a grown man is supposed. The album lead by the lead single Words is ballad heavy which are where Bobby is the strongest. Longtime producers Tim & Bob contribute six songs to this project including the grown & sexy If I Can't Have while Bryan-Michael Cox gives us the concert ready Sweetness. To my surprise Bobby also covers the classic Bobby Brown song Rock Witcha to great success. There's a few songs on here which feature guest appearances from rappers 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks & Piles which came off as filler to me, but they don't take away from the strength of this album. Bobby V may not be a strong a singer as KEM or Will Downing, however with Fly On The Wall he shows that he does deserve a place in the R&B world and I look forward to his next album release.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"After \"JAGGED LITTLE PILL,\" I thought that there was no way Alanis could ever create material that would even come close to that amazing debut album. I was very, very wrong! \"Under Rug Swept\" is not the continuation of \"PILL,\" but it certainly rivals it with similar rhythms and melodies (not to mention the beautiful poeticness of \"JUNKIE\")! To put it simply, '21 Things I Want In A Lover' 'Precious Illusions' and 'Hands Clean' recall the white heat that made 'PILL' so enormously successful, while recalling 'JUNKIE' with emotional, deep lyrics. With or without Glen Ballard, Alanis is a true master of her craft. \"Hands Cleans,\" the first single, is a beautiful, up-tempo, radio-ready cut that is deeply personal for Alanis. This song is based on a true life account that goes back to her years as a teenager. Like all songs from Alanis, though, each is either based on experience or thoughts on society. \"So Unsexy\" speaks of insecurities, and how people can sometimes feel unworthy when compared to others. Too Deep? Well, that's just Alanis. Love her or not, \"Precious Illusions\" is definitely the best track on the entire album. Hard rock, mixed with hip-hop, and deeply meaningful words that speak of dreams that give illusionary happiness, I can't get enough of this song. But then again, the whole album is so well constructed and balanced, there isn't a tune on the entire record I could honestly call my least favourite. Some tracks that are missing, and are also brilliant, include: \"Sister Blister\" (Japan only album track - also available on \"Hands Clean\" singles for the UK, Canada and Australia), \"Fear of Bliss\" (Japan only album track - also available on \"Hands Clean\" singles in the UK and Australia), \"Unprodigal Daughter\" (UK and Aussie singles), \"Awakening Americans\" (Aussie single), \"Symptoms\" (UK and Aussie singles), \"Bent 4 You\" (UK and Aussie singles), \"Offer\" (UK and Aussie singles), \"Sorry 2 Myself\" (UK and Aussie singles), and \"Hands Clean - Acoustic Version\" (UK, Canadian, and Aussie singles). Kudos to Alanis on another job well done.","classification":5,"fold":7}

It has alright lyrics though.\n\n(Nice to Meet You) Anyway - 3.75 stars. Stronger than Just Friends, weaker than Follow Through. It makes for a decent song though.\n\nChemical Party - 3.5 stars.

This song is kind of weird. I don't really know much about it besides some person defended and captured Gavin's heart...But the lyrics: \"When you came to my defense\/With a knife\/In the shape of your mouth\/In the form of your body...\" doesn't make too much sense to me. I do like the ending though.\n\nCrush - 4 stars. Thank you, Gavin. You delivered another strong track. I love the composition of this song. Once again, good job!\n\nI Don't Want to Be - 4.25 stars. Gavin's first single. It's a great one at that. Gives off a good message.\n\nMeaning - 3 stars. This song doesn't really do much for me...it's skip-able.\n\nMore Than Anyone - 3.25 stars.

{"text":"Jamie Foxx made his fans wait a long three years for this album. And coming off the huge success of his break through album Unpredictable, there was quite a bit of anticipation for this album. But Jamie switched it up a bit with this album compared to his last. Intuition has alot more up tempo\/radio friendly tracks than Unpredictable did, but Unpredictable has alot more romantic\/bedroom friendly songs. But both albums have a pretty reasonable balance of slow tempo and party tracks. The one thing that hasn't changed is that Mr. Foxx still has an amazing voice. And The Dream, who handles the production on most of the tracks on Intuition with five of the albums 15 tracks being produced by him, which works sometimes, like with the happy go lucky first single \"Just Like Me\" which pushed this albums sales up, despite it not being a huge single, it still made a dent on the charts. And then on the baby making slow jam \"Slow\", again produced by the Dream with its echoing softness, we get to hear Jamie at his best vocally. \"Slow\" will definetly make any late night affair alot more passionate, as Jamies hazed vocals drip like honey over the banging beat. And then on \"Overdose\", the ballad about lost love produced by the Underdogs, we get to hear the Unpredictable Jamie Foxx again, as most of his last album was produced by the Underdogs to. \"Overdose\" is my favorite track on the album so far, because its where he sounds the most comfortable and he really captures the heartache in this song with his smooth vocals. And then there's the weekend affair anthem, \"Weekend Lover\" which sounds like a typical mid tempo Jamie Foxx R&B track, which stands out as well. And one funny thing about this album is that one of the best songs is the 1:49 seconds long \"Intuition Interlude\". Even though the song is really short, he still really sets a grown and sexy mood for the second half of the album with this track. But other than that, alot of the rest of the album is up tempo\/party\/radio music, similar to the huge club hit about alchohal influenced cheating \"Blame It\". Overall, Intuition isn't going to win any awards for R&B album of the year, but it serves Jamie Foxx fans with another healthy helping of his grown and sexy R&B, even though  there are some obvious attempts to capture some radio airwaves, it never really detracts from the overall appearance of the album. As long as Jamie Foxx still has his amazing voice, im sure he will be able to give us good R&B music...He made us wait long enough though...lol\n\nGrade:\nB-","classification":4,"fold":7}

For newcomer Emeli Sande, she has had a lot to prove in so many ways, with her songs and to a generation of singers that have no voices. Her debut single, Next To Me is very upbeat and delivers well. I like the rhythm of the song, it is very simple and strong in voice. I hope that there are many more good songs from Emeli Sande down the road. She has a lot of good pipes in her soul. She has been in the shadows of artists like Adele this year, and joke singers like Nicki Minaj this year.

{"text":"I have bought all versions, but this is something special sound-wise if you can listen in a 5.1 system , the blu ray version\n\n-The  the blu ray  instrumental versions are great, you can listen to  a lot of stuff unheard before.\n-High The Memory (Studio Run-Through) is great for a couple of listens, pretty clean unlike the other run throughs, that a are  dirty and noisy for my taste. It includes magical moments of squire`s beautiful singing  in 1:49 (in High The Memory (Studio Run-Through))  if you are a true yes fan, this passage with chris doing harmony, unburied under anderson,  will make you cry. This take did not make it but is way better than the final chorus released on the record.\nOf course squire`s bass work all over the 4 songs is absolutely genius imho  -There are lots of great rock and prog players out there, but squire lines wereunique, imho more profound musically than his teachers, other momumental counterpointers and out of the box bass gods that preceded him  like jack bruce,  Mccartney and Entwistle, specially the latter with his sharp rotosounds,  his massive Rickenbacker sound and elegant basslines.

{"text":"Five stars for the tight harmonies and the individual and collective talents of Home Free. As I said with their premier album, there haven't been harmonies like this since the Mills Brothers, and that is high praise indeed. That said, I had some difficulties with the arrangements of the standards that are on the album. \"Arrangements\" are interpretations, but it's hard to interpret or put a new spin on songs that have been around since the 1930s. I'm not saying that it can't be done, but it's a tall order and for someone whose been living these songs since the 1940s, the initial response was one of disappointment. I was set to give it 4 stars or, on my rating scale, 8 out of 10.\n\nBUT then I started listening (third go-round) to the voices and harmonies and the way they were interwoven to produce what for me is slowly becoming the standard for acapella group. They're so good that it may be that orchestral backup would interfere with the purity that these guys bring even to the more \"novelty\" songs.\n\nEach song highlights the extraordinary talent of each member of the group. A big plus is that they really seem to get along together and appear to be really likeable on a personal basis. That makes a difference even in how you hear their music.\n\nThese ARE an extraordinary group of guys, and even with my minor disappointments, I can't wait for their next album. Was really happy to see that they're now recording for Columbia Records!\n\nP.S. Next Christmas, make it a \"winter\" album with \"The Christmas Song\" (you know, the Mel Torme song) and \"Blue Christmas.\" And please don't make me wait for your next album for 10 months.","classification":5,"fold":7}

This recording shows the band at its best,\n\nRaul Malo has never sounded better and, frankly, I believe he simply gives a better performance when inspired by The Mavericks. There is not a single cut out of the 14 on the album that you might want to skip over. I dare say that several will become Mavericks classic from the opening song, \"Back In Your Arms Again\" and \"That's Not My Name \" (an homage to early 60's rock) to \"As Long As There's Loving Tonight\" (shades of Louie Prima) and \"All Over Again\", The Mavericks you expect.\n\nRaul Malo has once again brought the Mavericks into the forefront.

{"text":"The career of singer\/songwriter Lucinda Williams continues to gain momentum with the release of her new LP, \"West.\"\n\nA moody collection of life, love and Americana, the record testifies to her ever-evolving talent and drive for musical perfection.\n\nWilliams is a tough chick -- the kind you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of -- but her sensitivity comes to the forefront once again.\n\n\"Are You Alright?,\" the lead single and opening track, is beautiful in its stark vulnerability. Asking questions such as, \"Do you have someone to hug and kiss you?\" and \"Is there anything I can do?,\" Williams could just as easily be singing to a friend as a would-be lover. She enhances the song with an emotionally resonant romanticism that stems from uncensored, unyielding honesty.\n\nThis upfront quality permeates the collection. \"Everything Has Changed,\" for instance, underscores the monotony of life, whereas the richly melodic \"What If\" has Williams questioning many so-called facts of life.\n\n\"Where Is My Love?\" is passionate and pleading in its quest for the ultimate affirmation, appropriately going hand in hand with the autobiographical song \"Learning How to Live.\" A particular standout, the latter finds Williams picking up the pieces of her life and moving on after a difficult breakup:\n\n\"'All I have left is this dime store ring\/But I wouldn't trade it for anything\/The days ahead will never be the same\/For you I might have even changed my name\/I'm learning how to live.\"\n\nThe melancholy edge of the disc can also be attributed to the recent death of her mother, whom she pays tribute to in the desperate yet understated \"Mama You Sweet.\" This experience surely played a part in the composition of another standout track, \"Fancy Funeral.\":\n\n\"So don't buy a fancy funeral\/It's not worth it in the end\/Goodbyes can still be beautiful\/With all the money that you'll spend\/There's no amount of riches\/Can bring back what you lost.\"\n\nHer search for love continues on the haunting, lyrically intense \"Unsuffer Me.\"\n\nAlternately, \"Rescue\" finds her articulating the disadvantages of being a damsel in distress.\n\nDifferent melodic tones and rhythmic patterns break up what would otherwise be a slightly monotonous album. \"Wrap My Head Around That\" has funky, organic grooves with clean-cut lyrics that don't mess around with pretense or metaphors, and the surprisingly upbeat \"Come On\" rides along an impressive electric guitar solo as Williams dismisses a deserving former flame.\n\n\"Words\" attests to the life-affirming power of language, whether uttered or harbored within, providing the most seductive melody of the disc, while the title track closes the album with her most evocative lyrics yet:\n\n\"I sleep out in the desert\/Under the stars above\/And keep making an effort\/To wander into love\/Who knows what the future holds\/Or where the cards may fall\/But if you don't come out west and see\/You'll never know at all.\"\n\nWilliams will likely never be able to replicate the cultural impact of her already classic 1998 album \"Car Wheels On a Gravel Road,\" but \"West\" proves that her talents as a musician continue to mature.\n\nWith her compelling abilities to connect with listeners on such an intricate, personal level, it is no surprise that more than 20 years into her career, her fanbase only continues to expand.\n\niTunes and Best Buy are among a myriad of music retailers that sell slightly different versions of \"West,\" offering various bonus demos of the album's selections.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I am extremely saddened by the untimely death of Amy Winehouse; she had so much more to give! Back To Black by Amy Winehouse features her talents as a professional singer, songwriter and guitar player. She even provides her own background vocals on some of these tracks! I'm impressed. Amy had her personal demons; but she does an incredible job performing the songs on this CD. The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is beautifully done. The liner notes include the song lyrics as well as the credits.\n\nThe album begins with Amy singing her heart out on \"Rehab.\" She sings of a woman, probably based in part on her own experiences, who is not exactly eager to go to a rehabilitation center as a way to get better. The musical arrangement has a strong percussion element that supplies the foundation for the music; the guitar and brass work well for \"Rehab\" to create a lush musical arrangement. Nevertheless, this arrangement never steals the spotlight away from Amy's vocals; and \"Rehab\" is a powerful, catchy and memorable number. \"You Know I'm No Good\" starts off with what sounds like a rap or hip hop musical intro; but when the music goes into the main portion of the song you get that `60s style arrangement Amy does so well. Amy sings this without a superfluous note and she never falters. \"You Know I'm No Good\" explores complicated, painful love relationships and Amy delivers this like a champ! In addition, I really like \"Just Friends;\" Amy sings this wearing her heart on her sleeve. Her excellent diction enhances her performance even more and again the music fits in perfectly with her singing.\n\n\"Back To Black,\" the title track for this album, reminds me of a tune The Supremes might have released in their time. Amy delivers this without a hitch and that's grand. \"Back To Black\" deals with the pain that can come with the ending of a love affair; and \"Back To Black\" is obviously a major highlight of this album. \"Love Is a Losing Game\" is another tune that explores the painful end of a love affair. \"Love Is a Losing Game\" also has a somewhat mellow, old school vibe arrangement to accompany Amy as she sings this to perfection and beyond! \"Wake Up Alone\" has complex key modulations but Amy handles this like the pro she is and always will be! \"Wake Up Alone\" stuns me with its beauty even though it's not the happiest of songs; Amy Winehouse does a great job on \"Wake Up Alone.\"\n\n\"Some Unholy War\" has Amy singing, playing guitar and providing her own backup vocals. \"Some Unholy War\" has Amy squarely in the spotlight--right where she belongs! Although the track set appears to end with \"He Can Only Hold Her,\" the CD has silence for about 20 seconds before we are treated to a remix of \"You Know I'm No Good.\" Excellent!\n\nReview update: There is a two CD \"Deluxe\" edition of Back to Black; here is the track listing according to Amazon's British website:\n\nCD 1\n1. Rehab\n2. You Know I'm No Good\n3. Me And Mr. Jones\n4. Just Friends\n5. Back To Black\n6. Love Is A Losing Game\n7. Tears Dry On Their Own\n8. Wake Up Alone\n9. Some Unholy War\n10. He Can Only Hold Her\n11. Addicted (an extra track for the first CD)\n\nCD 2\n1. Valerie\n2. Cupid\n3. Monkey Man\n4. Some Unholy War (Down Tempo)\n5. Hey Little Rich Girl\n6. You're Wondering Now\n7. To Know Him Is To Love Him\n8. Love Is A Losing Game (Original Demo)\n\n\"Addicted\" is a very good tune; Amy sings her heart out! \"Valerie\" showcases Amy's excellent diction and the musical accompaniment fits in perfectly with her singing--I love it. \"Cupid\" features just how well Amy could interpret a lyric with a reggae style that just can't sound any better--and I'm very impressed. In fact, Amy's rendition of \"Cupid\" sounds even better than the original; and that's grand. \"Monkey Man\" is another fine song; and listen for Amy to do a great job on \"Some Unholy War;\" she really pours her soul into ballads like this one! \"Hey Little Rich Girl\" just plain sounds good; and \"You're Wondering Now\" is absolutely brilliant. \"To Know Him Is To Love Him\" is very well done; and the second CD closes with a demo of \"Love Is a Losing Game\" which leaves me wanting more!\n\nBack To Black still sells well years after its release; this proves just how wonderful the music is on this album. This CD and especially the two CD set is a \"must-have\" for Amy's fans; and people just discovering Amy would do well to start with this album. In addition, people who enjoy songs with a retro soul, R&B and even reggae flavor to them will not be disappointed.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"\"True sound of the underground\" is the 3rd full length studio album by Swedish Sleaze Metal\/Hard rock band `Sister Sin' and one of the most characteristic cases of female fronted Sleaze metal.\n\nDespite the bold title of the release, one could claim that, in a sense, the new \"Sister Sin\" album is based on the sound of the underground hair metal; specifically the band has gone back to the original sleaze metal concept as defined by \"Motley Crue\" in the early 80s. Indeed every song on \"True sound of the underground\" references directly the first two iconic sleaze metal records of \"Crue\". So you can expect loud but sleazy guitar riffs topped by short yet effective leads, dark bass lines and totally `Tommy Lee'-like drumming (with the trademark locomotive tempos and characteristic fills). Evidently their brand of sleaze metal has a very American flavour on this new album, perhaps a result of being signed by US label `Victory Records', still whatever the reason, the approach is spot on and seems to work perfectly for them.\n\nWhat arguably deviates from this musical approach are Liv's vocals which instead of the high pitched tones and dark\/romantic themes, are seriously aggressive (without going `brutal') and mostly mid range. In comparative terms the vocal approach is very very similar to that of \"Crashdiet\" (and their front man Simon Cruz). In terms of lyrical themes, the concept of the album evolves around youthfulness, defiance, social revolution and, of course, sleaze metal style.\n\nThis album was quite as a surprise to me, as I did not expect `Sister Sin' to come up with such aggression in their new material. The preceding album was pretty rocking but not quite as focused or commanding as this new one. Therefore this time they go beyond loud and heavy rock'n roll to a more personality expressive style.\n\nOverall new \"Sister Sin\" album is an ideal choice for any fan on `Sleaze metal'. If you have bought the latest \"Ratt\", \"Crashdiet\" and \"Crazy Lixx\" albums then \"True sound of the underground\" is definitely next in line.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Seth MacFarlane decided to record an album of traditional pop (for lack of a better term).  Wisely, he didn't record done to death \"standards\" like \"Stardust\", \"Makin' Whoopee\" or \"I've Got You Under My Skin\".  Instead, he chose lesser known songs from the same era (plus one new song).  Seth's singing is good, but equal praise must go to the arrangements by Joel McNeely.  Here is where these songs came from:\n\n1. It's Anybody's Spring - sung by Bing Crosby in the movie The Road to Utopia\n2. Music is Better Than Words - sung by Dolores Gray in the movie It's Always Fair Weather\n3. Anytime, Anywhere - recorded by Frank Sinatra in 1953\n4. The Night They Invented Champagne - sung by Leslie Caron, Louis Jourdan and Hermione Gingold in the movie Gigi\n5. Two Sleepy People - a hit for several people in 1938, the most popular version was by Fats Waller\n6. You're the Cream in My Coffee - a hit for several people in 1929, the most popular version was by Ben Selvin\n7. Something Good - sung by Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer in the movie The Sound of Music\n8. Nine O'Clock - from the Broadway show Take Me Along\n9. Love Won't Let You Get Away - recorded by Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney in 1958\n10. It's Easy To Remember - a number one hit for Bing Crosby in 1935\n11. The Sadder But Wiser Girl - sung by Robert Preston in the Broadway show and movie The Music Man\n12. Laura - a hit for several people in 1945, the most popular version was by Woody Herman\n13. You And I - a hit for several people in 1941, the most popular version was by Glenn Miller\n14. She's Wonderful Too - original song by Seth MacFarlane","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Man I hate getting my hopes up only to be disappointed. The hype over this album was said that it was supposed to be the best produced album in years by Jackyl. That might be true, but the materiel wasn't worth producing well to begin with.\n\nThere is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh songs. Not one single song here sticks out above the rest as the best song on the album. They all are a mediocre at best rating. Nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of Jackyls 'best of'.\n\nUsually I like when Jackyl do cover versions, but even \"Everyone's a winner\" here is a song that is just meh, not a song I liked before and still don't. The only track that seemed to have anything going for it was the final one, but then again, how many times is Jessie Dupree going to try and write the same song? Enough with the \"Rev it up and go\" already. The same can be said for \"Just because i'm drunk\"... it's just a watered down version of \"Secret of the bottle\".\n\nI don't get why some have already said \"Rally\" is a favorite of theirs? The song sounds silly with lyrics \"Rally, Rally, Rally, Uga, Chugga, Ugga Chugga\"... really? Was this inspired by wanting to see a rally car being driven by that 20 year old dancing baby animation thing? Not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over another song and it sounds out of place together.\n\nThis album has failed to rock me, roll me or jackly me off in any way. Sure, the production is good, but you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish. The attempt at a deeper sound of metal too doesn't seem right for Jackyl. It sounds more like them trying anything to keep current, and thats not why fans stick with them.\n\nI haven't given up hope, and think Jackyl can still bounce back, but they sure are not the same band they once where. They really need to find themselves again and work out what made their first couple of albums great. Nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a Jackyl classic.","classification":2,"fold":7}

{"text":"When it has came down to Rihanna's last album Rated R, she just really didn't have the songs to shine upon and deliver, in the ways that Good Girl Gone Bad had delivered. That unfortunately wasn't a very strong record, yet she is about to try it again later this year with Loud, her 5th album. Her debut single from that album, Only Girl (In The World) isn't a driven song, in fact it feels less than strong. She tries to bring out more of an electronica sound to her voice, but the feeling of the song, doesn't score a home run. I really wasn't very impressed with the song, in fact it felt like the wind didn't even take my breath away. I really think Rihanna should take her time, rather than rushing her music out there. Hopefully, when Long comes up in November, she can deliver better songs than this one did. Only Girl (In The World) wasn't one of them.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":7}

{"text":"Signed to a new record label after his last label insisted he do an album of eighties covers, Adam Lambert's new album \"The Original High\" is a pop delight.\n\n\"Ghost Town\" opens the album, a gently strummed sung which kicks into high club gear with jabbing synths and a haunting whistle refrain. Vocally, Lambert is powerful but exhibiting restraint and nuance. The title track is a Trancey dance number with Lambert crooning \"Just let me feel the rush like the first night\" in a tender falsetto, letting rip in the final minute of the song.\n\nThe midtempo \"Another Lonely Night\" alternates between skeletal verses and the wobbly synth-driven chorus - truly beautiful, while \"Underground\" is a lovely R&B-ish ballad. Lambert's passionate vocals get to shine on the more stripped back ballad \"There I Said It\", while the synth ballad \"Rumors\" is a duet with Tove Lo garnished with eerie electronic flourishes.\n\n\"Evil In The Night\" sets scratchy funk guitars to skittery hip hop beats and groovy bass. Highlight has got to be the chugging rocker \"Lucy\" with Brian May on guitar and a skyscraping chorus, towards the end, his yelping duelling with the squealing guitars.\n\n\"Things I Didn't Say\" recalls UK dance duo Disclosure, while \"The Light\" starts off a sublime dance number till stabbing synths shimmering like the aurora borealis kick in for a killer chorus.\n\nThe deluxe edition has three additional songs, the upbeat \"Shame\", the guitar-driven mellow \"These Boys\", and the incredible quirky sounding drum-free \"After Hours\" which sounds like a song to play in the dying hours at a disco. Adam Lambert has been consistently bringing out strong albums and this is no different.","classification":4,"fold":7}

Sevyn Streeter, whom sung back up for Chris Brown on his Michael Jackson sampled hit She Ain't You, has a lot to prove from her own spotlight. Sadly, for her debut single It Won't Stop, I found the song to not even ignite at all. It felt more like Chris Brown was taking over with the song a bit more than her rhythm. She really didn't bring out more from the voice to stand and drive her sensual rhythm. I think if she wants to thrive in it for the long run, she needs to find ore from her voice to say it won't stop. Because for her and from her, it just didn't feel like it stood from the song. Hopefully, if her debut record comes around, there will be more than just a second of heartbeats in song.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":7}

Surprising me  was Tim Robbins' \"All My Children of the Sun.\" So he can sing,  too? Amazing.\n\nListen to Greg Brown singing \"Sailing Down My Golden  River.\" He has a Johnny Cash thing going on when he sings it, don't  you think? Check it out.

{"text":"The 2nd solo album from BONNIE POINTER is another self-titled album title, which features mostly remakes of Motown oldies, featuring a purple cover with a drawing of her. Ultimately, it is not as rewarding as her excellent 1st solo album released just one year prior to this that has a red cover. I don't know why the decision was to redo more old Motown songs from the 60's , whether it was her decision, producer Jeffrey Bowen or Motown . Only 6 songs, with only 1 song being an original new song, DEEP IN MY SOUL, which is excellent! It is a ballad much in the vein of the inventive tunes on her 1st album. It's what this album should have contained more of - original music.\n\n As for the other 5 songs, I guess since HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was a big hit, they combed the Motown catalog for more classics to redo. It's far too many to have done. What should have been a step forward in doing more progressive music like on her 1st album, was instead a fatal error that pretty much ended her solo career. This easily could have been an EP, and probably should have been only that, not a 2nd full album of remakes. Of these I CAN'T HELP MYSELF , JIMMY MACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES are the best. The arrangements are at least new & different than the original versions. But really, how could she top the original versions. It's a case of overdoing it. Even the presence of SLY STONE and FREDDIE STEWART paying on 2 songs doesn't add up to much, as well as OLLIE E. BROWN, TRUMAN THOMAS and NATHAN EAST - all top session men. I once read that there were more recordings done for her 2nd album, but they were shelved in place of this. Grave error. This could have advanced Bonnie's career had it been filled with great songs like her 1st. And why name it BONNIE POINTER like the 1st? All it has done is confuse people.\n\n So, if you like Bonnie's singing, and she sings great on here, or Motown oldies remade, you'll like this. Otherwise, get her 1st slo album - it IS amazing. Bonnie ledt Motown after this album, and recorded one more solo album, IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT, in 1984 for the Private I label. That is better than this album, features all original songs, and even has Ruth & Anita singing background vocals on 2 songs. The Pointer Sisters , of course, were now platinum recording artists with a string of hit singles and albums . A shame she won't be let back into the group, but since she left in 1978, that was it for her with her sisters as a group.\n\n Released in late 1979 on MOTOWN M7-929R1 with the purple cover.

{"text":"The Heavy return with a heavy hitting album in 2016. Like most, I've been a fan ever since catching these guys on the Late Show with Letterman where they played \"How you like me now\" and \"What makes a good man\" and I have been looking forward to hearing them put together a new album since.\n\nFinally it comes, and ... well, nothing really sticks out like the previous two mentioned songs, but in different ways there is some great songs here that would definitely be welcomed around the set of the previous hits. Saying that, it's kind of hard to put this band into a category of what exactly their style is... as they seem to take on many styles, mix them up and what not, but unlike many bands, these guys make it work!\n\nSome songs sound kind of generic ok, like the first two tracks... they are nothing special, but have that kind of \"Robert Randolph\" thing going... you know, it's not memorable, but it's good while it's playing, then you forget it, but if you hear it again it's like, \"Oh yeah, that one\"... nothing bad about it, it's not filler, but it's not great, but it's ok if you know what i'm saying?\n\nThe best tracks here for me are \"Not The One\", \"The apology\", \"Nobodys hero\", \"Miss California\", \"Ghost\", \"Mean ole Man\" and if you have the bonus track, \"Panic Attack\" which some seem to be getting a low score on for some reason? Dunno if its me or whats happening there?\n\nIt's a real shame we're living in times where only R&B music is being paid by the record companies to be shoved down 12 year old girls throats and those who don't know what music really is. Because these guys here really deserve to have their music played everyday and not just be seen occasionally on a guest spot on tv or heard in a movie now and then. These guys are band flying low under the radar that should be soaring high and being taken notice of.","classification":4,"fold":7}

There is an real 90's vibe to the track, but it is obviously modernized in all the right ways.  The vocals are creamy good, dwelling in that ambiguous nature with which Active Child stakes their claim as well (What is feminine?  What is masculine?).  This is a great introduction to a band I can't wait to hear more from.  The musicality is fluid and dreamlike, which only adds to the lasting impression made by this band.\n\nI will be snatching up their album as soon as possible!","classification":5,"fold":7}

I put in the album and the first song I was jamming, of course yet as I was listening to the rest of the album, I was looking to connect to something. Along the way, there were a few I was really pleased with. \"Trust & Believe\" of course but what really surprised me was her duet with Ashanti. Ashanti got her swag back and it sounds like her voice has grown since whatever album, you choose. I kept listening, hoping to get more of the same and I started to realize that this album is more in the vein of \"A Different Me\" where everything is \"safe\" and not as passionate or energetic. I will listen to the latter half of the album a second time but I'm not expecting \"Just Like You\" kind of groove, emotion or passion.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"During a Larry King interview, Cher Lloyd revealed that she had a falling out with X-Factor\/'American Idol' cohort Simon Cowell (Lloyd & Cowell parted ways over disagreements regarding Lloyd's musical direction: Cowell=wanted Lloyd's music\/image to remain 'kid-friendly', Lloyd=not 'kid-friendly'),\n\nCher Lloyd was then determined to break away from her singing competition pop star-groomed self & prove the X-Factor\/'Idol' mainstay wrong.\n\nThe result is quite good. Cher Lloyd's 2nd effort finds the UK native all grown up, but not so much so that she alienates her well-established fan base. In fact, aside from her core (young) fan base, 'Sorry' is bound to attract new fans as well.\n\nSure, the fresh, bouncy & carefree pop sound is still there. However, just because 'Sorry' is full of slick 'radio-ready' pop doesn't necessarily mean it's 'kid-friendly' (and if the Parental Advisory label doesn't tip you off, then I don't know what will). The 20-year old (acquiring more control over her music career) turns things up a notch. As stated above, Lloyd did not want to be seen as 'kid-friendly' anymore. P.A. label aside, some glaring examples include the tracks:\n\n3. ''I Wish'' - The album's lead single. Here, Lloyd lists a barrage of things that she wishes she had, namely ''a butt & a rack''. Rapper T.I. makes a guest appearance on the track.\n\n5. \"Dirty Love\" - Lloyd sings about how \"I'm getting bored\" with \"...all the right boys'' & ''I need a wild boy\" to have a good time with (both in the bedroom & out).\n\n7. \"Sweet Despair\" - Her love interest screwed her over. Lloyd tells him to, \"Go & put the knife in\" to (figuratively) stab her. In an odd way, reminds me of a cross between Taylor Swift's ''I Knew You Were Trouble.'' & Green Day's ''Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)'' [yeah...don't ask].\n\n10. \"M.F.P.O.T.Y.\" - an acronym for...well, the 20-year old boasts that she's going to host the greatest party ever. Or in her words, ''...the Mother F- Party Of The Year\"!!! & that everyone's encouraged to attend. She teases a boy at the party by telling him, \"Keep it all in your pants, boy.\" The chorus reminds me of Weezer's ''Beverly Hills''\n\nThe tracks \"Sirens\" & \"Human\" display a more mature sound & a reflective Lloyd, shedding her bubblegum pop music\/image by showing that she's a serious artist. She upped the ante so to speak.\n\nI'm slightly disappointed (reason for only 4 stars), however, that Lloyd seems to equate 'grown up' with smoking *see album cover* & using explicit lyrics. Ms. Lloyd doesn't need to use foul language throughout or smoke (no offense to people who smoke) to show how much she's 'grown up'.\n\nOverall, 'Sorry I'm Late' has a refreshing sound & presents Lloyd as a viable artist. She's not just a flash in the pan. It shows promise with Ms. Lloyd blossoming into a mature young woman.\n\n-Chloe","classification":4,"fold":7}

He compares the Boyz as being on a par with Celine Dion, Andrea Bocelli, Sade, and Kenny G. Oh come on, the first 3, of course not, they are completely different, and terrific in their own genres...but Kenny G, DOH! I think the Boyz would give up singing if they ever heard that one. Comparing Boyz 2 Men to Kenny G is like comparing silk to polyester, prime rib to hamburger, Belgian chocolates to dog chocolates and champagne to grape juice. Come on Mew! Hey, maybe there's a reason why, in your \"About Me\" section, you give yourself the nickname of \"The Jerk\".\nOk, now I have that out, I shall get back to the album. These guys are a talented foursome from Philly. Their vocal harmonies are of the best Motown tradition, but given a modern touch and are second to none. \"I'll make love to you\" is one of the most romantic songs ever, but we've come to expect great songs like that from Babyface. The Boyz also wrote quite a few of their own songs that are featured on this album,  which further showcases their talents. This album is a must for all R&B fans.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"In the follow up to 'Cork Tree,' Fall Out Boy had to capitalize on their success to engrain themselves. Their first single here, comes off less as a single, and more as an arena-anthem. As a single, I thought it was good when in first came out, catchy, unique, good build-up. However, this song has worn on me, and not by radio mind you, but just the song itself. The song could be described as an angry power-rock (rather than power-pop) anthem, and because of the style that goes along with a song like this, it just doesn't hold any staying power. Maybe for a month or two, but then it's history.\n\nSo overall, if you've never heard the song, try it, you might like it.

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nI was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.\n\nThis song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?\n\nAnd don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here\n\nFREE MUSIC:\nFrom Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free","classification":5,"fold":7}

I love Raheem DeVaughn's version of \"We are One\",and  Joe's version of \"Can't Get Over You\" (and his video for this song).

{"text":"I'm tired of the bland musical product that oozes through corporate pipelines. There's a deadening sameness about the fuzzy guitars and humdrum drumming and affectless vocals of contemporary pop. In this environment, the deliberate creation of an unusual album feels like a gust of fresh air.\n\nDavid Byrne of Talking Heads fame has teamed up with another brilliant nonconformist, St. Vincent (Annie Clark, formerly of Polyphonic Spree), to write and record songs set to danceable electronic beats by John Congleton. They are accompanied by the complex, swooping, angular orchestrations of a very funky horn section. Both artists sing lyrics of ambiguity and anomie that recall some of their intriguing solo performances, but \"Love This Giant\" doesn't rehash their previous work. It's is a one-of-a-kind hybrid, and I like it a lot.\n\nByrne and Clark open with the first single, \"Who,\" a very propulsive, rhythmic track on which they duet, but then they start alternating lead vocals. Clark sings the even-numbered and Byrne the odd-numbered songs until they reach \"Lazarus,\" when they duet again. Clark takes over for the next two tracks, while the final two belong to Byrne.\n\nThe album has an arc to it, beginning with high-energy music -- jumpy and jagged on the first three cuts (I especially enjoy \"Weekend in the Dust\") -- then dialing back the energy somewhat for three songs whose dreamy intros bring to mind minimalist composers like John Adams, Philip Glass, and Steve Reich, particularly on \"I Am an Ape.\" With \"I Should Watch TV,\" they leap back for a couple of tracks into the jangly, dissonant sounds that opened the album. When Clark performs \"Optimist\" and \"Lightning\" (another favorite of mine), a cool, pensive atmosphere prevails. The penultimate song, \"The One Who Broke Your Heart,\" has a cheerful, lively tone that blends the music of two more collaborators: the soulful Dap-Kings and the Afro-beat band Antibalas. The last track, \"Outside of Space & Time,\" is simply a gorgeous love song.\n\nThere's a lot happening on this recording. It's often sharp and chaotic, yet occasionally smooth and calm, so it really calls for careful, conscious listening. I've heard it all the way through three times now, finding my interest renewed each time. I'm sure to listen several times more to absorb what's going on, which makes this release a clear \"buy\" for me.\n\nA 37-minute live concert of songs from this album is available free online at NPR, together with eight additional minutes of rehearsal footage and insights about the creative process. Filmed at Strathmore Music Center in Rockville, Maryland, it's a must-watch to appreciate the unity of vision with which David Byrne and Annie Clark approach their music and art. The eight-piece brass band is integrated into their choreography, Annie is a badass on guitar, and we get to hear two songs not on the album, St. Vincent's \"Marrow\" and Talking Heads' \"Burning Down the House,\" in entirely new settings.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Dear Music Appreciators,\n\nWhat a cool album cover.  Kind of a lofty suggestion though, water for MY soul?  Water, with all its refreshing, restorative, and life-sustaining qualities, for \"my soul?\"  I hate to be the semantics police (I know, I know, there might be other meanings here) but unfortunately the music on this album doesnt quite do these implied concepts justice for me.\n\nBut for plenty of Joss Stones fans, perhaps this album will be sort of like water for their souls I guess, in the sense that Joss  always has a beautiful voice and a sort of a hand-holding, healing-soul-sister were all in this together kind of vibe going on, and lots of people will enjoy and identify with that regardless of what she does on her records.\n\nYes, there are reggae beats and a wide variety of instruments spread around on this album, and thats pretty cool and groovy and everything but where is there any sense of joy or fun or at least some good ol fashioned showing off of that big expressive voice?  Even the \"up with people type songs (such as Star or Clean Water)  seem restrained by an overly busy instrumental background and relatively understated vocals and never quite seem to take off and soar.  Star hands the big chorus off to a childrens choir for example, which gives the song a sort of plodding, creepy feeling rather than turning it into the jubilant, people-come-together kind of anthem it could have been.  And this one particular example of choosing a musical style or effect over a chance to feature Joss Stones greatest asset (her voice) might just be symbolic of the main issue that infects the entire album.\n\nIn many ways WATER FOR YOUR SOUL is too long and too serious, and it lacks the big vocal moments that have made Joss Stone a pleasure to listen to so many times in the past.\n\nBut I criticize because I care.  Funny thing is, despite all of its issues, with each succeeding listen Ive found more to like and cant deny that there are words and music and beats here that want to wear some grooves in my mind.  Okay, fine, Ill take numbers 1 through 5oh and numbers 7 and 8basically Ill take half the album and you can keep the rest.\n\nSincerely,\n\nConstant Listener","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"I may be one of the few devotees of a now obscure one-shot summer replacement NBC-TV variety series called \"Mickie Finn's.\" Never missed an episode; loved the quirky, cluttered speakeasy replica where honkytonk pianist Fred Finn and his small band entertained with a mixture of modern and old-timey tunes.\n\nFirst and foremost of the supporting cast was Fred's tall, blonde, buxom wife Mickie (an alias). She sat, always in a tight revealing costume, on the lid of his upright piano and simul-strummed a banjo while nimble-figered Fred tickled the keys, Dimples Jensen blew a left-handed trumpet, Cugar Nelson and Owen Leinhard wailed on trombones, Stormy Gormley alternated between tuba and cello and Spider Marillo pounded out that rhythm on the drums. Curiously missing in this aggregate that often played Dixieland standards was a clarinet.\n\nThe set for \"Mickie Finn's\" was marvelous, supposedly a duplicate of Fred's San Diego nightclub of the same name, which was a fantasy tribute to elegant but kitschy on-the-QT watering holes of the Prohibition era. The show was always fun; there were a number of interesting guest stars like Crazy Guggenheim, Bobby Darin and the Dapper Dans barbershop quartet, and Mickie was always so cool, a genuine star who, like husband Fred and that great ragtime music, has been all but forgotten.\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes NBC ever made was not renewing \"Mickie Finn's\" for the 1966-67 season. Instead, they filled that 9:30-10pm slot with a sitcom called THE HERO. Like the program it replaced, \"Hero\" lasted only 16 episodes. Blame ABC's PEYTON PLACE for both shows' premature demise.\n\nAs for the CAPITOL Records 1965 LP entitled MICKIE FINN'S - The West Coast's No. 1 Speakeasy (ST 2210), its fatal flaw is stated right on the front cover: \"...plus ten violins.\" Additionally, there's two extra trombones, a soprano sax and three guitars. Put 'em all together and it spells: MUDDLE, a musical confusion that is nothing like the Mickie Finn's I remember.\n\nThere are moments before the extra musicians join in that give a good idea of the genuine Fred Finn sound. \"Sidewalks of New York\" is an excellent example of his aggressive playing style, as is the first go-round of \"Five Foot Two.\" Finn's souped-up Voss Nickelodeon gets a serious workout on \"Bumble Boogie.\" The man's speed and note-for-note accuracy is awesome!

{"text":"Amy Winehouse-Back To Black *****\n\nSo after my first listen to Back To Black, mine, and I think everyones introduction to the great Amy Winehouse I was left speechless. All I could say was this girl is talented, damn is she talented. I had to listen to the album numerious times before I could fully take in what I had just heard and how fantastic it was.\n\nThe terms throw-back and retro are used way to loosely these days. If your gonna attempt to be retro and a throw back you had better know what your doing. Well Miss Winehouse did not try to be retro or sound like a throw back, she just is. From her now standard beehive hair due to her Etta James meets Lauren Hill on a good day voice. From her self-deprecating to self-medicating lyrics, Amy Winehouse is one of the most pure and honest atrists to emerge in a long time and Back To Black is a testiment to this.\n\nFrom the opening chorus of 'Rehab' which will surely become her signature song in the years to come, through the get-off-my-back stance of 'You Know Im No Good' through 'Some Unholy War' early 60's girl group feel to the albums closer of 'He Can Only Hold Her' Back To Black is an album worthy of all of the praise which has been bestode upon it.\n\nAs for our hero in this story, Miss Winhouse has maintained to be a homage to what was and yet be completly original in an age of dissposable music and artists. From her tattoo's to her sexy sultry voice, and her drug addictions to her convictions, if Back To Black is an indication of what is to come then we are in for one hell of a ride.","classification":5,"fold":7}

This cover of an early sixties tune reeks of \"I am so coked out that I can't think of anything original to record\" Syndrome- alot of artists suffered from this in the late seventies, with the advent of cocaine as the drug of choice. Coke hampers creativity, but , i guess a lot of these Laurel Canyon artists bought the hype peddled by Jann Wenner in his music rag, Rolling Stone, which by this time had become more mainstream. Jackson Browne has written some great songs (These Days comes to mind) but this Stay cover, with it's overtly \"white cracker\" falsetto by some female singer, is a disgrace!

After the departure of Lou Gramm, they have instead of making fresh and new music have decided to make a few re-introductions with a new lead singer.

It feels fair, but doesn't strike as strong and invigorant like when they had made their dues paid off back in the 70's and 80's.

{"text":"Soulfly's self titled debut album from 1998 has to be my least favourite Soulfly album. Soulfly have definitely since moved on to create some very strong material, but if I set aside nostalgia and judge this album fairly on its own merits I cannot claim it is a very good record.\n\nThe album sets the tone for most Soufly albums to come; the material blends together world music influences and groove metal along with Nu Metal sections like Sepultura's 1996 album Roots, and similarly it was also produced by Ross Robinson, this time fresh from producing Limp Bizkit's 1997 debut album Three Dollar Bill, Yall$.\n\nLimp Bizkit's front man Fred Durst (and also DJ Lethal) makes a guest vocal appearance on the album on the track `Bleed,' but he isn't the only musician to perform on the album aside from the members of Soulfly. Chino Marino from the Deftones shows up on `First Commandment,' and Benji Webb from Skindred adds some of his distinctive flavour to `Prejudice.'\n\nEven the albums main single `Eye For An Eye,' features Burton C Bell and Dino Cazarez from Fear Factory, who's bassist Christian Olde Wolbers appears on yet another of the album's tracks later on. All that is before you even consider the non-famous contributors like tribal percussionist and Max's friends and relatives. The album is much more like a large project, some grand experiment like Probot or Roadrunner United than the debut album of a band who write songs together in a room.\n\nI did like the album for a time, but it has not aged very well. I find it difficult to listen to in one sitting and think it is more of an album for cherry picking a few of the best moments from than sitting down to and consuming whole. Don't get me wrong, even with all I've said there are some moments on the album that are very good, `Bumbklaat,' and `Fire,' are good songs.\n\nI also like the intro to `First Commandment,' even if it is a little too similar to Tool's `Disgustapated,' for comfort and finally `Eye For An Eye,' is good even if you do sometimes feel a little like it is an attempt to repeat the success of Roots Bloody Roots however knowing or unknowingly that may be on Max's part.\n\nOverall though, the music for me at least is a little to plain and uninteresting during the proper metal sections, and the tribal sections do not fit as well as on subsequent Soufly Records. This, coupled with the production and the aforementioned disjointed project feel makes this album Soulfly's weakest in my opinion. I wouldn't go as far as to say it is valueless and Soulfly fans should check it out and judge for themselves, but unfortunately this is not an album that I personally enjoy all that much.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"These days when most bands aren't saying much, Green Day manages to convey an entire message in a song. After 20 years of singing Billy Joe still sounds exceptional on his newest track \"21 Guns.\" The song is a departure of sorts for the group that has made fast-moving alternative tracks a mainstay. Instead it's a somewhat tragic and somber tune. But it still includes their signature beat and Billy Joe's voice always comes through loud and clear. I enjoy it very much and feel that it's one of Green Day's most original and reflective singles to date.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I first came across Tommy as a sideman on his brother's and Max Roach's albums, so when I saw this one years back I grabbed it. Common wisdom claims he was unrecognized, but in fact he was highly regarded among his peers and jazz enthusiasts. I won't go into his total discography as a sideman, but if you look it up he was definitely first call trumpet for some top musicians.\n\nListen to the sound samples on this album at&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Tommy-Turrentine\/dp\/B002FDKYTC\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tommy Turrentine<\/a>&nbsp;for a taste of the music itself. It is certainly hard bop a la Jazz Messengers (and I have to wonder how he escaped a stint with that group.)  He shines on each track, especially as accompanied by a strong front line comprised of his brother Stanley on tenor sax and Julian Priester on trombone. The rhythm section is especially strong too -  Horace Parlan on piano, Bobby Boswell on bass and Max Roach on drums.\n\nPart of the reason this album is so tight is the fact that Tommy had extensive collaborations with most of the ensemble. He is featured on more than a few albums (and performances) with his brother, Parlan and Roach. It shows here because they are all on the same page musically.\n\nThis album was recorded for the Bainbridge label at the Capitol Studios in NYC on January 19, 1960. One can lament the fact that this is his only album as a leader, but he is represented (and featured) on a number of other albums where his talent shines. On that count we are fortunate because he won't fall through the cracks like so many other talented musicians before and after him.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I have been listening to this while working on a project, and it has helped keep me relaxed and focused. Although I already own much of this music in other recordings, I was impressed with Cobra Entertainment's first \"Chillout\" set and was curious about their follow-up. It is just as good, and I enjoy the mix -- it was put together well and flows very well. And it lives up to its name -- there is nothing to spoil your chill here.\n\nThe performances are very good, often by well-recognized orchestras from eastern Europe, particularly Bulgaria and Hungary. Some of the soloists are recognized as top-notch international performers, such as Hungarian pianist Jeno Jando who appears on a number of tracks.\n\nAnother reason I found for the purchase, beyond the ridiculously low price, was to get to know some composers and works I was not familiar with, such as the guitar works of Francisco Tarrega. One beautiful piece that was a real surprise for me was Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Cradle Song\", which I hadn't heard before.\n\nThe quality of the recordings is good to very good overall. Bitrates are variable and range from 171 to 246 kbps on average. Total download size is 719 MB for 7.5 hours of music.\n\nThe set really lives up to its name. Warmly recommended.\n\nAmazon no longer makes composer information available on the product page or even in Cloud Player. (I'll say it again -- shame on you, Amazon!)

This one features 22 of her greatest works. There are way too many personal favorites like: Sweet Dreams, I Fall to Pieces, Back In Baby's Arms, She's Got You, Crazy and well really she could make any song come alive with emotion. The sound is superb. My only beef is that I purchased this for only 8.95 at Wal-Mart in the cardboard box and it does not feature a booklet with dates, personnel. Well, I'm an old record nerd, but for most people that may not matter. (All these songs were recorded between 1957 and 1963, the year of her tragic plane crash). If all you want is the music, this is one everyone should have in their home.

{"text":"This musician is on a roll, releasing three amazing CDs in close proximity.  I hope the sales follow the stunning music.  \"Broken Valentine\" opens the set with Isadar's piano vibrant, joyful, with a wistful touch, like a failed love affair that energizes you to go and love some more.  The title track \"Red\" has a brisk and vibrant piano that follows several themes.  \"The Man Who Broke My Heart\" may be my favorite track with its melody expansive, perhaps with touches of anger tempering the joys of the heart.  \"Letting Go\" hits a more somber reflective tone on the longest track on the CD before soaring into orbit about two minutes into the song with Isadar vibrant runs on the piano.  \"En Face Du Miroir (Facing the Mirror)\" has a slower pace that matches the often melancholy melody.  The set concludes with the amazingly confident \"Blood...Thicker Than Water\" that to me speaks of the joys of family relationship, strong despite its ups and downs and periodic conflicts.  \"Red\" is vibrant piano, incredibly inventive and fresh.  Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Paolo Nutini makes a huge splash with his debut album, These Streets. Paolo displays a natural talent for singing and songwriting; and his voice is rich and full of masculine warmth. Just one listen to this CD proves it!\n\nThe track set begins with \"Jenny Don't Be Hasty.\" Paolo sings with the style of a seasoned pro; this number about a woman he wants makes a strong start for this album! The electric guitar, drums and percussion make a good musical arrangement. \"Last Request,\" another highlight of this fantastic album; lets Paolo sing with great sensitivity of how he wants one last time alone with a woman who doesn't love him anymore. The melody charms me with its beauty; and I predict that you will enjoy \"Last Request\" very, very much.\n\n\"These Streets,\" the title track of this album, begins with some pretty awesome guitar; and when Paolo comes in this number takes off like a jet! Paolo laments losing his childhood because in retrospect he realizes things were simpler for him back then. The guitar works wonders for this number; and the guitar alone with Paolo's voice makes \"These Streets\" a true masterpiece!\n\n\"White Lies\" has another beautiful arrangement for the guitar; and \"Loving You\" lets Paolo sing happily of finding his one true love. Paolo also shows off his wide vocal range, sometimes singing a few words in falsetto--flawless!\n\nThe album ends with \"Alloway Grove.\" This number starts with the drums and guitar; and when Paolo comes in he sings this perfectly! Paolo sings of his disappointment that the girl he loves is no longer there for him. The upbeat melody belies the sadness of the lyrics; but it all works well for Paolo and his musicians. The lengthy number works well.\n\nThe liner notes include the lyrics to all the songs except for some of the lyrics to \"Alloway Grove;\" and the artwork impresses me. We get some good shots of Paolo, too.\n\nPaolo Nutini's first album sounds like a tour de force of a very seasoned talent--which is truly phenomenal since he's still rather young and this is only his first CD. I highly recommend this CD for fans of comparatively mellow rock and pop vocals.\n\nGreat job, Paolo!","classification":5,"fold":7}

There are far better recordings of the symphonies out there, with better performances and recording fidelity.  However, those recordings come at a high price and typically don't have the quantity or variety that this album features.\n\nThat being said, the price of this album is just about unbeatable, as are the rest of the Rise of the Masters releases, so I really can't complain about any slight issues, because these performances are just fine.","classification":5,"fold":7}
{"text":"My favorite album is The Division Bell.  For some reason 20 years ago that album connected with me.  I know it's not a classic like Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here or The Wall, but to me Division Bell is a classic.  Just an amazing listen.  Without hesitation I ordered the Endless River as the press release advised it's a continuation of the sessions left over from the Division Bell sans the vocals.  So going in I knew what the expectations would be.  I am not disappointed.  It feels like dreamy, floating David Gilmour era Pink Floyd.  Look anyone who is a fan, or knows their PF history...the band experimented in the early years with instrumental albums and album sides.  That's the closing book end to their career.  I like it, it will definitely get repeated listens.  If their is a gripe, this release could have been marvelously included in the 20th anniversary Division Bell box set.  What a treat that would have been...but nonetheless, a great new listen from the band.  RIP Richard Wright.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I've been a Slipknot fan since they first came on the radar in 2000 and thought they were really hard and cool, even \"Version 3\" which was more structured and more like straightforward rock. I kind of moved away from Slipknot and got more into thrash and death metal but after the death of their drummer, I found myself paying attention to the band once again. This album \"The Grey Chapter\" is definitely in the memory of their passed comrade and one song is sung to\/for him. It is a very intimate album but it can go from sounding soft and sentimental, to the soft to loud dynamic found in most Stone Sour songs, ultimate hardcore metal with authentic pain and sadness, and almost Pantera-esque presence oand power at times. I've heard complaints that this sounds like bad nu-metal or something until Stone Sour put out another one but this doesn't feel like something excessive put out to cash in. Of course there are a few tracks on here that aren't really that great, almost every Slipknot album has a few fillers. Still, this is one of Slipknot's best hands down  up there with their best work. They used to sing about pain and anger from another standpoint but here it's coming from their own tragic loss and it really elevates the performances, the song quality, and the overall album. Sure, they use some Stone Sour like clean vocals\/guitar once in a while but this is DEFINITELY a Slipknot record when all is said and done. I would recommend it to any fan, I was starting to lose faith in them but this reaffirmed it for me. If not here, their debut or Chapter 3. For anyone still hating Slipknot for being nu-metal or being too trendy, that should be put to rest because they have proved themselves.","classification":5,"fold":7}

I was not willing to wait until spring of 2002 for the US release of \"Living Proof\". I was happy to shell out the big bucks for her new album. Needless to say, the results were positive. \"Living Proof\" is ten times better than \"Believe\". The material she chose to record is far better than most of the songs off its predecessor. Although I do think Cher overdoes it on the vocoder sounds on this cd, I was able to forgive her for that since every song on this cd is a winner in my book. I immediately fell in love with \"Alive Again\" which is one of my favorite tracks off this cd. I was completely surprised when I heard Cher cover one of my favorite songs from another dance diva Amber. Cher does a swell job at \"Love One Another\". Unlike \"Believe\", \"Living Proof\" is a stronger dance album. The songs are tight and the material was just right for Cher. I love this album.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"MG is actually Martin Gore. Martin Gore is actually that guy that pretty much makes Depeche Mode Depeche Mode. Songwriter, guitarist, keys, angelic backing vocals...that's Martin Gore. MG is what he's going by this time around on a new solo LP. This solo LP is all instrumental and filled with analog synth buzzes and whizzes. There's some beats here and there, but mostly it's some seriously heavy synth stuff. If you're sniffing around this one looking for some classic Depeche Mode sound, you will be sorely disappointed. But if you like instrumental electronic music in the vein of Tangerine Dream, Cluster, and the Reznor\/Ross film score noise, then you might have found that brisk fall record you didn't know you were looking for.\n\nSo right off the bat, I was never much of a fan of Depeche Mode. I was still playing with Star Wars toys when they appeared in the early 80s. In 1990 when Violator was unleashed on unsuspecting, sexually frustrated sadsacks, I was beginning a love affair with Seattle, Rush, and Queen. My loyalties didn't lie with personal Jesus' and enjoying silences. As the years rolled on I grew a fondness for DM, and in particular Martin Gore and his contribution to what became the DM sound. In 2009 the band released Sounds of the Universe, an album that relied heavily on analog synths and 808 beats. It was a throwback to their beginnings as an new wave\/goth\/electronic band. I really dug it. Fast forward to me falling heavy for bands like Tangerine Dream, Cluster, and modern guys like Jakob Skott and Jonas Munk. The analog synth became this tool for time travel. Childhood noises and wisps of yesterday emanated from these circuit-driven machines. Thanks to Boards of Canada's mix of nostalgia, eeriness, subtle breakbeats, and synth layers my affinity for the analog synthesizer was cemented firmly. So when I came across this MG record I was quite taken aback. Not that I didn't think Martin Gore was capable of creating such a subtle and sublime collection of songs. I just couldn't imagine he'd have any interest in such a project.\n\nThe songs on this double LP are short snippets. There's a few that hit above the four minute mark, but most are two to three minutes in length. They linger long enough that once they end you wish they were a bit longer. It feels like a score to some dystopian sci fi film, and each song is scoring some colorfully shot scene of orange and purple horizons, vast space, and crumbling humanity. You know, the fun stuff. \"Pinking\" is bright and prickly, while \"Swanning\" sounds like a slowed down version of Wire's \"I Am The Fly\". \"Exalt\" is swaths of synth light. It's the moment the ship takes flight and breaks through the atmosphere. \"Elk\" is one of the shortest pieces here and one of the most sublime. Imagine the Beatles' \"Sun King\" played entirely on a Clavinet and moog. It's spacious and illuminating in just over two minutes. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, well Martin Gore takes us through light years in just over two minutes. \"Europa Hymn\" feels and sounds like some lost Boards of Canada tune. Maybe something left off Music Has The Right To Children. Again, this feels very familiar yet alien at the same time.\n\nElsewhere, \"Creeper\" has the menace of a John Carpenter piece and \"Stealth\" feels like something from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' The Social Network S\/T. \"Islet\" sounds like cascading digital water. It's sparse and moody, while \"Trysting\" sounds like the audio innards of some late 80s video game. \"Blade\" seems like a proper finish to this record, feeling all melancholy and dour.\n\nI'm not sure I'd ever jump head first into another Martin Gore record like I did with this one. I don't think anything could ever hold up to my cantankerous scrutinizing. Not that I'm saying he doesn't have another quirky little album like this in him, I'm just saying I highly doubt it. Besides, I'm not sure in my strange, little interior world he could write a better imagined soundtrack. MG is dark, subtle, melancholy, moody, and quite wonderful. It's an anomaly, really. I hold anomalies quite close to the chest.","classification":5,"fold":7}

The intensity of Mr. Cockburn's passion for political justice and human rights, and his interest in human relationships, nature, and spirituality continue unabated as themes in songs from his fine new album, \"small source of comfort\".  Mr. Cockburn has engendered an abiding and fierce loyalty among his fans in a career spanning many decades because of this.  He is an artist who has that rare ability to connect with his audience on a personal level.  On this album, his songs continue to tug at our conscience and hearts and are, indeed, a source of comfort as the title suggests.\n\nOther reviewers have contended that the melodies on this album do not have the immediacy of his earlier work.  Yet listen to the songs a few times and they will grow on you; for the patient and intelligent listener there are substantial rewards to be had.  He continues to be a lyrical craftsman, and is among the finer acoustic guitarists on the planet.  He also continues to challenge himself and his listeners by exploring different musical idioms and instrumentations.\n\nThis album is classic Bruce Cockburn and is highly recommended.  Here's hoping that Bruce Cockburn may continue to entertain, inspire, and enlighten us for years to come.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Real get-up and go music with a positive energy not often found in tunes of recent times. \"Soul Refershing\" is simply beautiful and \"Smile\" is interesting (Robert's sister Lenesha does the vocals here). \"Calypso\" (not to be confused with the Harry belafonte tune of the same name) is an interesting novelty. A few of the songs (like \"I Need More Love\") are somewhat lacking in the right mix of melody and energy that characteris\\zes this group-but a so-so song from these guys are better than the best of a lot of what's out there now!\nI would suggest that those who may be interested in this start with \"Live at the Wetlands\" before going on to \"Unclassified.\" That will give you a better preperation for this. Then pick up \"The Word\" (RR without the Family Band) and the \"Sacred Steel\" Cds after you listen to \"Unclassified.\" Then see these guys live and  you will have hope for the future of American popular music.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"There is so much that can be said about the legacy of Prince. He has been one of the most innovative and driven entertainers of the past forty years in soul, funk and R&B. But nevertheless, he has always had a few songs that have not been able to ignite aflame thee way he showed it years ago. Still, the guy has always been a genius, and brilliant with driving his crafts in song. A few years ago when he came back with Breakfast Can Wait, I was not very thrilled with the song, because I felt the song was more like a step back from the driven soul he had back in the 80's and the 90's. His latest song 1000 X's & O's, off of his latest album Hit N' Run, isn't really as strong in the rankings he has had for years in great songs. The song has a similar bass line to Breakfast Can Wait, and feels a little bit repetitive at the soul. It is a fairly good song, but it doesn't ignite for the die hard Prince fan, and for new fans of the Purple One alike.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"Music: 5 stars; Compilation: 2 stars; Sequencing: 2 stars; New relevance: none.\n\nIt's of course pure coincidence, but with McCartney scheduled to come to Cincinnati in early July, I've been going through another Macca re-appreciation phase. I have many of his CDs (but certainly not all). Recently there was the new biography \"Paul McCartney: The Life\" by noted rock biographer Philip Norman. And now there is this, a new 'best of' compilation (the first one since 2001's \"Wingspan\"), and on top of that, personally curated\/selected by Sir Paul himself.\n\n\"Pure McCartney\" (4CDs; 67 tracks; 257 min.) is a head-scratcher from start to finish for me. Let's start with the obvious: there is a TON of great music on here, opening perfectly with \"Maybe I'm Amazed\" from his debut solo album, and then quickly going to a selection from the Ram album (\"Heart of the Country\"), and by track 3 we are already in Band on the Run territory (\"Jet\"). By the time we are at the end of CD1 and going into CD2, I can't make heads or tails as to the sequencing of these tracks. It seems frankly all over the place and without any rhyme or reasons. Then, what is even more remarkable is what is MISSING on this compilation. Despite being a generous 4 CDs, there is NOT A SINGLE TRACK from the 1989 'comeback' album Flowers In the Dirt. Hence, no \"My Brace Face\" (a genuine hit, actually), or the touching \"Put It There\" or \"Figure of Eight\". How in the world is this possible? Surely I am not the first one to notice this, and Macca management asked Sir Paul about it. Also missing, just to mentioning these: \"Take It Away\" (a hit from Tug of War), \"Hope Of Deliverance\" (the delightful and warm 1st single from \"Off the Ground\" (and a genuine hit), and \"Wonderful Christmastime\", an iconic song that, despite its mere seasonal appeal, should be on here. And the worst of it is that we really shouldn't have this discussion as the 4 CDs as they are contain free space of good for about 40 min. worth of music, meaning another 7 or 8 songs could've easily be added to what is here.\n\nBottom line: I'm not sure for whom this compilation is intended: the casual (?) fan, if there is such a thing, or the die-hard fan? If you are the latter, you already have everything on here as there is no new or unreleased music of any kind. I would much rather see a \"McCartney Anthology\" release, patterned after the Beatles Anthology, with outtakes, demos, unreleased songs, live material, Just one example:\"The Mess\" was a live track from Wings' European tour in summer of 1972 (released as the B side of \"My Love\", later included in the reissue of \"Red Rose Speedway\"). This surely isn't the only song recorded on that tour? Let us have more! Now that would be something! Meanwhile, I am looking forward to seeing Sir Paul live in Cincinnati in early July!\n\n*UPDATE* I saw Macca in concert a few days ago. Fabulous 2 hr. 45 min. show, The guy looks at least 15 years younger than he is (74). Five years after his last show in Cincinnati. I compared the setlists of both. Remarkably, he played TWENTY songs not heard in the 2011 show. Thank you, Sir Paul.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"&iexcl;Tr&egrave;! rounds up with a very a solid 12-track set list, which kicks off  with the 1960`s flavored power ballad Brutal Love. The next two tracks, Missing You and 8th Avenue Serenade are as solid as any song from the previous  Green Day releases. Drama Queen gets the band back into the power ballad territory, however,  with the following four tracks Kid, Sex, Drugs & Violence, Little Boy Named Train and Amanda-, Green Day sounds  even more stronger than at the beginning of this album. Walk Away takes the band , once again, to the balladry territory, only to return to the energetic punk of Dirty Rotten Bastards-a  6 min and a half  punk epic similar in vein to that of Jesus of Suburbia- and 99 Revolutions, which in my humble opinion, has to be the best track on this album. The Forgotten closes up the album in a slow paced manner. In fact, it is probably one of the most melodic, polished  tracks of this CD. Overall, &iexcl;Tr&eacute;! Is simply the best disc of this trilogy. On a personal comment, each disc of this collection portrays a different effect on the listener. It has party, fun-like tracks, catchy pop\/punk tunes and  strong alternative punk songs worth to listen to. So, if you are a Green Day fan, grab this disc along with &iexcl;Uno!

{"text":"Kendrick Lamar is undoubtedly a rising star in the hip-hop world. Odd, Liberal, and Rebellious, Lamar is quite creative.  \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Swimming-Pools-Drank-Explicit\/dp\/B008PN7O94\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Swimming Pools (Drank) [Explicit<\/a>]\" balances Lamar's endearing idiosyncrasies and commercial sensibilities well. With moody, lush production with Drake sensibilities, clever references\/allusions to swimming and drinking, Kendrick Lamar pulls off a sold rap track in 4:07.\n\nSo from the forefront, it is obvious that \"Swimming Pools (Drank)\" will feature plenty of alcohol references.  The secondary hook (or bridge for lack of better label) confirms this in all it's simplicity: \"Pour up, drank, head shot drank\/sit down, drank, stand up, drank...\"  Then Lamar raps in verse 1: \"Now I done grew up round some people living their life in bottles\/Granddaddy had the golden flask\/backstroke every day in Chicago...\"\n\nThe sung hook is incredibly `intoxicating': \"...Why you babysitting only two or three shots?\/ I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch\/First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive init\/pool full of liquor, then you dive in it\/I wave a few bottles, then I watch `em all flock\/all the girls wanna play Baywatch\/I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it\/pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it.\" Yep, it's all about the DRANK!\n\nVerse two begins boldly, with Kendrick exhibiting some of those aforementioned idiosyncrasies where Lamar's `conscience' takes over: \"Okay now open you mind up and listen to me, Kendrick\/I'm your conscious, if you do not hear me...\"  Alrighty then Kendrick - few rappers are going in that direction for sure.  He later goes on to say \"...The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive\/this how you capitalize...I'm over influenced by what you are doin'...\" Hard not to get drunk just indulging into the song.\n\nSo essentially, \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Swimming-Pools-Drank-Explicit\/dp\/B008PN7O94\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Swimming Pools (Drank) [Explicit<\/a>]\" is pretty addictive, if for nothing else than all of the alcoholic references.  Maybe it's not the most `intelligent' track considering its message is all about alcohol, but it is hard to deny that it isn't well put together.  The production is good, the rhymes are creative even if the theme isn't, and Kendrick Lamar's album should be quite a listen.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Wiz Khalifa's latest album is nothing more than a huge dissapointment. With NUMEROUS pushbacks in the late 2012 you would think it was to make the product much better. But that didn't seem to be the case here. It's not anything but the lyrics that seems to be the problem here. If you wanna know how much money Wiz has and how much weed he smokes, just listen to this album. He makes more than an obvious point here in about 90% of the songs. I called&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Rolling-Papers-Explicit\/dp\/B004TP6O8O\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rolling Papers [Explicit<\/a>] a dissapointment because of the obvious attempts at mainstream pop status, but still a worthwile listen.

O.N.I.F.C. (Only N**** In First Class\/One Night In First Class) is the worst of all. And one would expect this to be good after the mixtape Taylor Allerdice, which was good as well.\n\nProduction heren is good. You can tell that Wiz picked the beats that have the nice long vibing sounds, which is heard all over this album. The best songs on here are the ones he colabs with other artists. \"Let It Go\" has Akon singing the chorus around Wiz' braggadocious lyrics. \"The Bluff\" has Cam'ron spitting a good verse. Even 2 Chainz sounds refreshing on \"Its Nothin\". And his Taylor Gang crew members sound better than him on \"The Plan\" and \"Medicated\". The single \"Remember You\" with The Weeknd sounds good, but having Abel lead off the song and sing the chorus and has Wiz rhyme about something totally different makes the song almost a waste. There are a small number of solo songs that Wiz has that he can hold his own, but don't expect much from those.\n\nO.N.I.F.C. had the potential to be a good album. I for one is very dissapointed after all the pushbacks and delays, this is the best we as fans can get. I think I am done with buying Wiz Khalifa's materal, unless its Taylor Gang or any colaboration albums (*hint, hint* \"How Fly 2\"). Anything else will be downloaded.

{"text":"Robert Plant and Jimmy Page,late of Led Zeppelin,mellow out with some R&B\/swing numbers like the Top 10 hit SEA OF LOVE and the Top 20 hit ROCKIN' AT MIDNIGHT. Joining Plant and Page in this ensemble is Nile Rodgers,who himself had chart success with his R&B band Chic. Rodgers had quite a workload with this album and Madonna's LIKE A VIRGIN. It's understandable that Plant and Page declined to carry on with Led Zeppelin after the 1980 death of drummer John Bonham. SOL was made famous originally by Phil Phillips in 1959. The differences between Phillips' recording and the cover are no \"buh-buh-buh-bum\" in the cover,a key change in the cover and Plant's accenting of some of the lyrics differently than how Phillips did it. I guess that's because Plant is English(as is Page) and Phillips is American(as is Rodgers). ROCKIN' AT MIDNIGHT really swings. It got the lively 1940's sound that the fighting men of World War II were dancing to at clubs. After this album,Plant,whose solo career began in or around 1982,continued going solo. Page formed his third band THE FIRM and released an album in 1985. Recently,the surviving Led Zeppelin members re-formed with a new drummer and are currently on tour.","classification":4,"fold":7}

Hopefully on his next album he will learn from some of the mistakes he made on this album. Some parts of the album are perfect, it's just not all of it is. Some of the lyrics seem a bit out of proportion for this album and don't seem to fit. Like the lyrics on \"Belief\" are a bit sexually driven and are quite stupid and lame. The whole album doesn't have a very sexually driven attitude at all, anyway that song is the only one that appears a bit out of the ordinary. \"Chariot\" has a very mature and overall wholesome feel to it. DeGraw seems to have real talent, writing all the songs himself in all, yet the comparisons I can make to Destiny's Child is unforgivable. Some of the songs are really amazing though, such songs as \"Follow Through\" and \"Chariot\".\n\nSo, I do recommend this album as you may find it different to how I found it.

There are songs that are enjoyable as you listen to them but nothing that grabs you and makes you play it in your head during the day.  Also the pressing of this album seems to be poorly done.

So if you plan to use this with a media server or Ipod device be prepared to enter all the Meta Data and change out album covers.\n\nConclusion:  I could only give this 3 stars do to the pressing of the CD  and the fact the material just does not do service to Marian's voice.

{"text":"It is a myth that soul was a singles medium. At least half a myth. In the 1960s, it was true. Most Motown albums were not meant to hold together as such. But when Stevie Wonder released Music Of My Mind in early 1972, he proved soul LPs could work as cohesively as any rock LP.\n\nAnd so it went for Gamble and Huff and Thom Bell, the Philly Sound. Both the O'Jays with Back Stabbers and here, this first Spinners album, are just that: albums. Playing the singles on AM was AM's gain and lack of FM airplay was FMs loss.\n\nThe Spinners, the album, does not have a concept like the O'Jays Back Stabbers or Ship Ahoy.  Or does it? If love and passion can be a concept, it is best illustrated on this album\n\nThere is the Philly Sound, there is........well, easy there, let's climb one mountain at a time.  The lush horns, strings, vibes, and master vocals are wound into one massive, wonderful silk sheet of sound. I don't have to tell you, just listen. Wagner would be proud\n\n\"I'll Be Around,\" \"Could It Be I'm Falling In Love,\" \"One Of A Kind Love Affair.\" Anyone born by 1970 or before grew up hearing these on the radio, and do you believe how stupid some of us were? We heard this music next to Daddy Dewdrop's \"Chick-A-Boom,\" or \"Have You Ever Been Mellow,\" by Oliva Newton John, and quickly ran to our King Crimson albums, unable to separate the prime rib from the beef jerky. The best soul from the worst pop. We look at ourselves now. Wagner would NOT approve.\n\nMore proof. Yeah, sure. Play part of Coltrane's Love Supreme next to Bobby Goldsboro's \"Honey,\" and run for the hills. The blimp has crashed. But take said 'Trane and then go into \"One Of A Kind Love Affair,\" and it will be the start of a one of a kind love affair--for you. Me too.\n\nTalking jazz,  I almost forgot. There is jazz here, too. Check out the third track, \"Don't Let The Green Grass Fool You\" I needn't go into this, but it proves my point. All this wonderful music is wonderful music, some of which happened to be singles. But listen to The Spinners from start to end, like a stranger to this music, and all the richness and craft and variation, and there is a ton, holds together musically and conceptually.\n\nWhat an  ALBUM","classification":5,"fold":7}
{"text":"There are very few artists that really did break out in the 2000 decade, whose music has meant to so many people, and is also melodic it really means a lot more than just a image altogether. Coldplay has honestly been one of those groups that really has been so dominant in their songs, they are definitely more infectious than most of the songs today that have felt more like they were cheap, and not worth anything overall. But what Chris Martin and company have still shown is that their songs are great. One of my favorite songs Coldplay has recorded was back in 2002 when they had recorded Clocks from their breakthrough album A Rush Of Blood To The Head. The song is definitely a deep and infectious song that is definitely so melodic it still reaches to the core of the soul every time I hear this song. It is absolutely worth owning as a part of your music library, and I sincerely recommend you have this song, even if you have never heard a Coldplay song before.\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Even if this weren't Robin Gibb's last recorded set, it would have been great.  \"Instant Love\" is a delightful pop tune with Robin and his son Robin-John trading verses, \"You were there for me when I was down.\"  \"Mother of Love\" is a stately melody with lush strings, \"Mother set me free, give me wings to fly eternally, Across the world the tide of war is rising; The suffering of children fills our eyes, Mother of Love, Angel of Light, I'm a long lost child so alone in the night.\"  \"Avalanche\" was originally written in the 1960's, but updated for this set.  It's a midtempo rocker, fresh and catchy.  \"Broken Wings\" starts out with bars from \"Days of Wine and Roses\" played backwards and then breaks into a toe-tapping dance groove, \"I never would abandon you, Upon the wind I hear you calling, No, don't go.  No, no, don't go.\"  The liner notes tell us \"Sanctuary\" was written about Robin's house on Isle of Man.  It is a transcendent track that marries a lovely melody with a catchy hook amid cosmic lyrics, \"Hey now, don't think twice; We could be together in Paradise.\"  \"Solid\" is a confident love song with Robin's tenor strong and lovely.  \"50 St. Catherine Drive\" is a gorgeous farewell to this master musician whose work with the Bee Gees and his solo sets shine like a musical beacon.

There is some strong material here, key tracks including Runaway, We All Sleep Alone and All Or Nothing, which is the standout of the album.

It shows a much softer side of him even though the lyrics reflect some anger and disgust like a lot of his more staunch and powerful songs. When I first heard it I had to confirm that this was in fact Billy singing. I liked it right away. It stuck with me to this day. It is a 1999 remaster. It sounds ok. There is not that much difference between it and the original '83 recording. It depends on what kind of sound system you are using. It does have more dynamic range than the old vinyl.","classification":5,"fold":7}
{"text":"There is no doubt about the feeling of the voice within these days. But there are those few guilty pleasures that have been one-hit wonders that have proven to be a bit more than that. For Uncle Kracker, who had done a brilliant duet with Dobie Gray on his classic Drift Away, he hasn't yet been able to try to dominate and top the success of that, as someone who was a protege of Kid Rock, but his latest single is a delightful diddy. Smile, the latest single from Uncle Kracker is a laid back and delightful pop diddy. The song has honestly came as nothing more than a complete surprise. I really like how surprising the song has been. I do hope his next single can be just as good as this one.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Touted as a return to the band's early, analog-driven improvisations, circa Phaedra and Rubycon, this 2-disc set promises a lot.  Originally known for stretching the capabilities of early synthesizers, the '70s Tangerine Dream, led by keyboardist \/ guitarist Edgar Froese, constructed a trademark sound of free-form washes of audio smears, frantically beeping sequences, symphonic electronics, and subterranean motor rhythms.  Subsequent decades found the band stuffing its catalog with blander, poppier, Yanni baloney.  So does Booster really redeem the band?  Maybe.  Several tracks, such as the Floydish \"The Greek Mirror\" or the 14-minute episodic \"Hyper Sphinx,\" do recall the throbbing oscillations that made Phaedra a theme song, to this day, of WXPN's long-running space-music show Stars' End.  But several tracks trip over their drum machine laces and major-key feet, falling into sun-drenched flowerbeds rather than an orbit around the dark side of Neptune.  Phaedra *****, Rubycon ****, and Ricochet **** remain the untouched trio of Dream classics, supplemented by Froese's first two solo discs, Aqua **** and the rare Epsilon in Malaysian Pale *****.  Booster is a rooster for the rest.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"You already know the tracks on this album, but the way I choose whether to buy or not usually comes down to the number of tracks I would probably be willing to buy anyway divided by the album price.  In this case I could easily see myself buying the following tracks to add to my MP3 collection:\n\nI Want You Back\nABC\nThe Love You Save\nI'll Be There\nNever Can Say Goodbye\nGot To Be There\nSugar Daddy\nand\nDancing Machine\n\nSo, when I saw this album listed in one of Amazon's $5 album selections I went \"click\" - sold.\n\nOK, in full disclosure I'm not a huge MJ fan, though I did have some of his stuff on cassette - \"Off the Wall\", but I thoroughly enjoyed the Jackson 5 - their music is a major throwback experience to when I was a young teen and their music was new on the radio.  It's amazing how many of these tracks have strong enough staying power to entice me to be interested in listening to them again 40+ years later.  Ha.\n\nJ5's music is upbeat, uptempo, and a hallmark of those heady days mainly in the early 1970s.

{"text":"This 3-CD set, recorded live in November 2014 across a period of three days at the Fillmore in San Francisco, is both exhilarating and frustrating. The exhilarating part is the instrumental music, which is, as on other DBT albums, of a generally high quality. The signature sound of this group is there: walls of sound, built of the amped up sound of two guitars, an electric bass and the on again off again organ\/ keyboard; high voltage guitar solos; heavy, elemental drumming driving the musicians along; arrangements complicated enough to make you want to listen but basic enough to make you feel in your groove while doing it.\n\nThe frustrating part is the quality of the recording itself, and especially the singing. Recording live across three days of concerts in front of a sea of fans may have pumped up the excitement but it didn't help the recorded sound, which is indistinct and fuzzy, rather than crisp as it is on previous studio albums. Listen to the version of The Righteous Path recorded live on this album. Compare it with the original on Brighter Than Creations Dark. The instrumental lines still come through but the vocal, well, thats another story. You can hear the singers on these live cuts but I defy you to tell me what they are saying most of the time. And thats a crime, because the members of the DBT write interesting lyrics, which add meaning, tell stories, and thus enhance the music. Those are things that don't happen on this set. Instead, you get mush exciting sounding mush, but mush nonetheless.\n\nReaders of this review should remember that 3 Stars is not meant to mean this is a bad record. It's not. It's good music but flawed in delivery because of a sound problem.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"Mary Christine Brockert died suddenly December 26, 2010 at the relatively young age of 54.  It was a sad day for the music world, particularly the R&B community of which Brockert, better known as Teena Marie shined brightly.  A big voiced singer known for hits like \"Square Biz\" and \"Lover Girl\", Teena Marie was a profound talent.  After believing 2009's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Congo-Square\/dp\/B001XJBDHQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Congo Square<\/a>&nbsp;was Marie's final studio album, 2013's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Beautiful\/dp\/B009PCHB5Q\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Beautiful<\/a>&nbsp;arrives posthumously, ultimately delivering Marie's best album in years. True to its title, Beautiful is nothing short of just that.\n\n\"Luv Letter\" gets things off to a rousing start. Opening mysteriously at first with spoken word intro by Marie (\"Music is meant to inspire, to elevate you and to take you higher...\"), it isn't long before Marie's signature adult contemporary R&B production\/groove takes over.  Well written and definitive Marie as of late, \"Luv Letter\" sets the tone and the bar loftily for Beautiful. \"I'm a love letter baby sign myself to you \/ sign myself to you baby, just sign myself to you,\" she sings on the memorable chorus.\n\n\"Sweet Tooth\" cedes no momentum, characterized by plush production and constant rhythm.  Marie's vocals take on a hip-hop rhythmic flow, quite teasing given the seductive, playful nature of the lyrics.  Zipporah Garnett provides a rap, which ultimately shows how hip Marie was and how she easily fitted into contemporary music circles.\n\n\"Rare Breed\" features Marie's daughter Alia Rose and Ty James. Very much in the adult contemporary R&B idiom, the 'contemporary' part of that title is particularly noteworthy. With burst of synths, Teena Marie looks back while also adhering to music of the new millennium.  A cut laden with personality, \"Rare Breed\" may be Marie's sassiest performances in years.\n\n\"Love Starved\" gives ode to Marie's heyday in the 80s given its production and overall sound.  Supported by rich backing vocals and delivering her own commanding lead, Teena Marie continues to be on 'autopilot'.  \"Baby I'm love starved \/ Hungry for real love wishing on a star \/ looking for a pure love with a heart that's true \/ needing comfort and protection boy \/ love starved for you...,\" the chanteuse sings on the chorus.  \"Simply Beautiful\", to quote Al Green.\n\n\"Definition of Down\" finds Marie styled in pizzicato strings, including harp.  Throw in some contemporary drum programming and the diva sounds very much in step with Jennifer Hudson and Keyshia Cole (stylistically).  Marie manages to look back as well, alluding to Chaka Khan classic \"Through The Fire\" when she sings \"Through the fire to the limit to the wall \/ here I come every time you call \/ like the autumn leaves that fall \/ never hesitate to give my all.\"\n\nOn \"Maria Bonita (for my Mother)\", manages to sing in Portuguese flawlessly on the chorus. Fusing Latin and R&B cues, songwriters Marie, Allen, and Cadena manage to deliver yet another solid performance.  Even stronger is a second dedication, title track \"Beautiful (for Alia).\" Here, the bass line is sick (in a good way), playing perfectly in to the slow-jam idiom.  Marie shines in her upper register, further accentuated by lush production and a well mixed group of backing vocals.  Seven tracks in, Marie hasn't missed yet.\n\nAfter her dedicatory cuts, Marie delivers arguably her most clever track in years on \"The Long Play\", a sensual play on LP (records).  Marie opens with spoken word, posing herself as a radio DJ about to drop the needle. The bass line seems a direct pipeline from the 80s, reminiscing The Isley Bros. bedroom hit \"Between The Sheets\".  Thoughtful, risqu in tasteful fashion, \"The Long Play\" serves as a masterclass of pushing the envelope just the ideal amount.  \"Give me the long play \/ drop it on me that's my song \/ give me the long play \/ we won't stop until the morning light,\" Marie sings seductively on he chorus.\n\nOn \"Carte Blanche\", Marie authorizes her lover to do whatever he wants to, confirming \"...any story you write, I'm gonna sign it baby....\" and \"...you're really bossy I know, but I love when you take control.\" Lush as everything else, \"Carte Blanche\" doesn't supersede \"The Long Play\", but remains highly above average.\n\n\"Give Me Your Love\", a Curtis Mayfield cover, once more features Alia Rose, who's raspier vocals are fine contrast to her mother's smoother, angelic pipes.  On \"Wild Horses\", an original, Marie does manage to allude to the Rolling Stones's classic of the same title.  Throughout the verses, Marie focuses mostly on her lower register.  Closing cut \"The Perfect Feeling\" is mysteriously beautiful, given it's ethnic musical cues.  Haunting, sad, and Celestial, \"The Perfect Feeling\" feels like a memorial to the late singer.\n\nEverything said,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Beautiful\/dp\/B009PCHB5Q\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Beautiful<\/a>&nbsp;is an exceptional closing to a brilliant career by Teena Marie.  Consistent, enjoyable, and creative, Marie left the musical world with a brilliant R&B album by all means. Furthermore, Beautiful provides 2013 with quite an electrifying spark. 4 stars.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"For his last disc, Matthew West did something different.  He invited his fans to send him stories about their lives, and he used that as inspiration in writing the songs.  It worked so well, that he did it again for his latest release, Into the Light.  And the results are just as fantastic.\n\nFrankly, one of my disappointments is that we don't get at least a hint of the story behind some of the songs in the booklet.  Yes, they are posted on his website, but last time there were a few lines about each song with the lyrics.  Not that these songs aren't universal and enjoyable by all, but it's always fun to hear a bit about what inspired them.\n\nThings start off with the light and bouncy \"Into the Light.\"  It's a fun mid-tempo opener that celebrates our salvation and being freed from the darkness of sin.\n\n\"Hello, My Name Is\" is one of my favorite tracks here.  Again, this one has a nice, up beat tempo and a very catchy melody.  The first verse talks about regret and defeat, but then the song goes on to remind us that we are really the children of God, and that should be how we identify ourselves.\n\n\"Moved by Mercy\" is probably the most unique song on here.  The first verse finds Matthew introducing a woman who was abused and hurt as a child.  But starting with the chorus, Caitlin Evanson joins him, and she sings from this woman's point of view while Matthew sings the promises of God that He hasn't abandoned her and is working in her life.  It really captures the struggle between pain and the promises of God well while still offering the hope of God's truth.  While this one starts out slow with some strings, it soon gets a driving rock beat.\n\nAnd hope is certainly one of the main themes of the disc.  \"Unchangeable\" focuses on God's unchanging love for us while \"Wonderfully Made\" reminds us that God made us exactly as He intended.  Even \"We are the Broken\" is an encouragement to share who we really are so others can see God working through sinful, imperfect people.\n\nThere are some songs of struggle here.  \"Waitin' on a Miracle\" is a song of someone trying to hold on to their faith despite the trials they are facing.  It's surprisingly upbeat musically wise.  \"Restored\" is the song of a marriage in trouble as two people commit to find the love that once brought them together.  And \"The Power of Prayer\" is written from the point of view of a kid who is watching his mom's heart break from the way his dad is treating their marriage.  This piano ballad is one of the few slow moments on the disc.\n\nThere are even a couple songs of conviction on the disc.  \"Forgiveness\" is the difficult call to forgive those who have serious wronged us.  It's got some cliched thoughts in it, but it's still a good track.  I also saw where \"Do Something\" was going early on.  It is a call to action against the unjustness that happens in the world.  The first verse is our reminder that God made each of us to do something to stop these things we see in the world around us.\n\nI've saved my other favorite for the end.  \"Love Stands Waiting\" is great song reminding us that, no matter what we've done, God's love will take us back when we repent.  It starts out slowly, but soon builds to mid tempo on the chorus.\n\nHonestly, that's the only issue with this disc.  \"Forgiveness\" and \"The Power of a Prayer\" are the only truly slow moments here.  The rest is pretty much mid tempo with a few faster tracks.  And it's all guitar and keyboard driven.  It's just shy of blending together.  More stylistic differences would really makes the tracks here stand out.  But thats a minor point because the songs here are just as powerful.\n\nMatthew has taken what could have been a gimmick and turned it into two great discs now.  Into the Light is a second great disc inspired by real people's struggles and the truths of God's word.  Listen and be encouraged.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Barbra Streisand's new CD \"Partners\" pairs her with 12 male vocalists including a duet using Elvis Presley's recording of \"Love Me Tender.\"  It is classic Streisand with lush strings, great arrangements and that glorious voice that soars to touch the sky.  I like much of the early part of the set, especially Blake Shelton's country chops almost mixing with Streisand on \"I'd Want It To Be You.\"  The set totally ignites for me when Barbara's son James Gould takes spotlight on the lovely \"How Deep Is the Ocean.\"  His voice jumped out at me on first listening, making me ask, \"Who is that!?!\"  \"How far would I travel to be where you are?  How far is the journey from here to a star?\"  The track is so powerfully felt that it may be the best track on the set with Streisand's vocals powerful and the harmonies gorgeous.  John Legend unexpectedly bowled me over in his duet with Barbra on \"What Kind of Fool,\" \"There was a world when we were standing still, and for a moment we were separated; And then you found him; You let the stranger in, Who's sorry now?\"  Josh Groban's teaming with Barbara on \"Somewhere\" inspires as these two gorgeous voices meld seamlessly.  While part of me wishes that songs Streisand had not previously sung were chosen, Barbra's liner notes makes each reworking personal.  This set is a wonderful addition to the Streisand catalog.  Enjoy!","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Small Source of Comfort is the worst Bruce Cockburn music ever!  Bruce Cockburn has not done it for me over the last several years.  His early work (up through \"Circles In The Stream\") has a sort of innocence to it.  It was filled with spiritual wonder and well crafted lyrics - poetic and insightful.  I lost interest from \"Circles\" until \"Stealing fire\" and \"World of Wonders\".  The CD \"Big Circumstance\" seemed to go back into his heavy political activism views.  His live CD was okay, but nothing like his first live CD \"Circles in the Stream\".  Then a jewel came along reviving Bruce as fresh and insightful again with \"Nothing but a burning light\".  Then came along a nice Christmas CD filled with unique arrangements, and then \"Dart to the Heart\". \"Nothing\" and \"Dart\" were fantastic.  Bruce seemed to back away from his political BS and back into spiritual songs, insightful lyrics, and songs filled with real meaning.  Bruce was back.  Then came Charity.  A pretty good CD but lacking a bit from \"Nothing\" & \"Dart\".  Then it went downhill.  \"Breakfast\" and \"You've never seen everything\" were musically good, but lyrically lackluster.  Kind of dull.  Then it got worse.  \"Life short\" was a dissapointment and a CD rarely listend to at all.  I thought it could not get any worse until \"Small source of comfort\" came out.  This is the first CD that is total trash and worthless.  Bruce has lost his mind, is alienating most everyone and appealing to the liberal left to the maximum.  Sometime I did not agree with some of Bruce's songs but I could undersand was coming from, or his view point.  I am open to other opnions and with music, you certainly have to be.  However, with \"Small source of comfort\" instead of love, spiritual, and political; the listener gets ALL political mumbo jumbo.  Yuck.  The music is not as good, Bruce's voice is not as strong, and most disappointing is the lyrical content.  The songs have no passion or insightful meaning, just quotable hate and low tolerance for anything other than those who preach tolerance but are the least tolerant of all.  I used to really enjoy Bruce Cockburn.  Wonder if the spiritual side will reawaken sometime in the near future?  Who knows, but \"Small Source of Comfort\" is awful.  I really tried to give it a fair shake by using the test of time.  I could not even listen to it when I got it so I put it away for a year and tried it again.  No such luck, it is just as awful today as when I first recevied it.  Can Bruce produce something worthy of listening to again?  He is so far left now that I do not know if he can pull himself back into some sort of normalcy.  Then again, I guess that is the trouble with the normal and I will just be waiting on a miracle.

Of course Green Day does get loud in a few songs, but every single song on this album is unique and stands out each and every time on its own.\n\nI don't know what this album means or what this Green Day will become in the future, but now that the trilogy is complete I am happy with what I got.

The lyrics she is given are worse than the worst Taylor Swift lyrics and her voice-cracking vocals don't do her or the song any good.  With \"Titanium\", Sia proved she is an excellent singer.  It's too bad it doesn't show here.\n  Overall, \"Wild Ones\" still gets the grooving going when it comes on.

{"text":"Just as Robert Randolph And The Family Band successfully entered the 2010s after\n  becoming a rock phenomenon which made him a hero on the jam band circuit a decade\n  ago, the band would decide to record a different and aspiring masterpiece, which was a\n  year in the making.  Released in 2010 and produced by T-Bone Burnett, We Walk This\n  Road will gives us a harrowing, but aspiring listening experience which feature the band\n  paying a special visit to American roots music that combine a stark mixture of the blues,\n  gospel and rock- blues standards while maintaining their high rocking artistry, for whom\n  they perform with compassion as these results succeeds in extending the bands scope\n  in a way that match its sound.  Featuring a high-pitched track set containing fresh new\n  original hits like Traveling Shoes, Back To The Wall, Dont Change and Take My Hand,\n  as well as on pop or blues standards, like Blind Willie Johnsons If I Had My Way, John\n  Lennons I Dont Wanna Be A Soldier Mama, Bob Dylans Shot Of Love, and a groove-\n  conscious pop-savvy take on Princes Walk Dont Walk.  The most striking sonic thread\n  that connects the winding paths are his visceral, but very worthy sacred steel virtuosity\n  that makes We Walk This Road a timeless music journey that they will be regarded for,\n  and despite the six half a minute Segue tracks, you will find the entire session to be an\n  interesting labour of love between Randolph and Burnett a special listening experience\n  that made it an unforgettable and uplifting achievement.","classification":5,"fold":7}

The song definitely ranks high with great stadium anthems like Queen's We Will Rock You, and showed what they are still made of as a Y2K band still standing strong. Yet, I honestly do wish though that I could say the exact same thing about their second song from American Beauty \/ American Psycho. Uma Thurman, the second single from that album isn't actually as catchy or as strong as the first song. It is alright, but not really as a strong song that really is more driven than what Fall Out Boy had shown before. I do hope there is another single that can be better from the band down the road.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"Once any noteworthy band \"blows up,\" it seems the U2 comparisons fly rampantly - first it was Coldplay and then it was Kings of Leon.  The Arcade Fire are subjected to nothing different.  Like the beloved U2 (who are the slightest bit too hyped at times), The Arcade Fire use minimalistic progressions and production tactics to make grand songs.  Creativity runs rampant on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Suburbs\/dp\/B003O85W3A\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Suburbs<\/a>, surprisingly trumping the grand&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Neon-Bible\/dp\/B000MGUZM0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Neon Bible<\/a>&nbsp;at times.  While \"Intervention\" isn't necessarily bested, there are songs of nearly\/if not the same level on 'The Suburbs'.\n\nThe album opens up superbly with the strong \"The Suburbs,\" where frontman Win Butler's vocals are their most clear and present - not to mention his grand falsetto on the refrain  (\"sometimes I can't believe it\/I'm moving past the feeling again\").  \"The Suburbs\" benefits from a fine and haunting production work filled with strings, electric and acoustic guitars, and piano.  \"Ready to Start,\" a personal favorite cut, maintains a driving groove and contrasts the mid-tempo groove of \"The Suburbs.\" Again, the superb songwriting lends a catchy refrain (\"If I was scared, I would, and If I was bored (broke, pure, etc.), you know I would, If I was yours, I'm not... now I'm ready to start.\" 'The Suburbs' bats a thousand with \"The Suburbs\" and \"Ready to Start.\"\n\n\"Modern Man\" finds the band dabbling in asymmetrical meter and once again a minimal harmonic progression provides the backdrop for Butler's vocals.  Not quite as epic as \"The Suburbs\" or \"Ready to Start,\" its still a fine cut.  \"Rococo\" loses no momentum, while \"Empty Room\" is an interesting listen, if a bit hard to decipher.  Regin Chassagne, wife of Butler leads the charge vocally but the busy production work overtakes her vocals.  This cut would've benefited from being mixed slightly better, but maybe the cacophonous effect was what the band had in mind.\n\n\"City With No Children\" proves to be much better featuring a notable bass line and a clever groove.  On \"City With No Children,\" the religious allusions come full circle as Butler sings \"feel like I've been living in, a city with no children in it, a garden left to ruin...\" \"Half Light I\" and \"Half Light II (No Celebration)\" are two contrasting cuts, both worthy of a couple of spins.  On \"Half Light I\" Regin Chassagne is the main focus, where her lovely vocals are better produced this go-round.  On \"Half Light II (No Celebration), \" Butler takes the reigns, with Chassagne's vocals harmonizing mid-way through the first verse, mixed in the background.\n\n\"Suburban War\" stands out, if mainly because of its stylistic changes at given points within the track.  \"Month of May\" finds Arcade Fire channelling \"punk rock\" to an extent  with its driving guitar work and Butler's raw vocals.  \"Wasted Hours\" doesn't necessarily stand out, but it is another solid number.  \"Deep Blue\" and \"We Use To Wait\" are both Arcade Fire cuts at their best.  On \"Deep Blue,\" the guitars take on a \"garage\" sound and the piano twinkles make this cut reminiscent of a saloon or lounge.  \"We Use To Wait\" makes clever use of a minimalistic piano figure and clever songwriting.\n\"Sprawl I (Flatland)\" turns out to be a languid, dark cut exploiting a vulnerable sounding Win Butler while its sister cut \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\" sounds as if it could have been equally at home on MGMT's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Congratulations\/dp\/B0037W68F4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Congratulations<\/a>. \"Sprawl II\" is a worthwhile cut if for no other reason than it contrasts everything else that Arcade Fire has released at this point.  Kudos for that.  A reprise of \"The Suburbs (Continued)\" closes the album.\n\n'The Suburbs' is easily one of the top albums of 2010.  Here, Arcade Fire deliver an album that is both captivating and different from their previous effort.  No wonder the Canadian based band debuted atop the Billboard Album Charts.  4 stars.","classification":4,"fold":7}
{"text":"Lotus Intro - I really like this intro for many reasons. The mellowness of the track is intoxication, and the length is very welcome.\n\nArmy of Me - A song about being independent, rising up against the disenfranchisement one tried to push on you. She sings about being a fighter, and no longer taking ones crap anymore.\n\nRed Hot Kinda Love - This song is basically about the freshness and infatuation of love in the moment, even if you at first were not looking for it. About not being able to think about anything else but the person you are in love with, and wanting to spend all your time with them.\n\nMake the World Move ft Ceelo Green - Right out the gates of this song I knew this was going to be a song that I liked. This song is about moving forward in the world with positivity. Ceelo Green brings his funkiness to the track, and the collaboration is very crisp and just works. This could make a definite single, and would make a very interesting music video. Very funky and positive track that is too short.\n\nYour Body - First single off Lotus and at first I didn't care for it, but to be fair I did hear the entire track. This track just pulls you in. After listening in the entirety I grew to love. I will say that I have heard only the censored version of this song, and I think it works very well. I heard rumors of a graphic version but haven't seen that anywhere.\n\nLet There Be Love - Right away this type of beat or production seemed super familiar. It's definitely a Max Martin production, and is something I believe will do well on the dance billboard, clubs and overseas. However, the beat sounds like something I have already heard, but cannot put my finger on. Definite potential to be a single, but I wouldn't release it as single number two.\n\nSing for Me - First ballad of the album. This is an uplifting, rising from the ashes kind of song. The beat reminds me of the type you would hear near the end of a late 80s-early 90s movie when the protagonist has learned the lesson of the movie, or when everything is in their favor. I know that is a random picture, but I was able to imagine a scenario right away and to me that is a good song.\n\nBlank Page - Sia Furler and Christina Aguilera have a very interesting dynamic when it comes to working together. This is also a ballad about regret and apology. This track is only Christina singing over a piano. Solid vocals all around.\n\nCease Fire - I did not immediately fall in love with this track. I think it was the ennunciation that did not pull me into it. But there are definite parts that I liked about it. This track is about knowing when to draw your cards, for you do not have to exhaust your energy on every call. It's also about realizing that you are not alone and have allies by you. Basically, just chill out. It's an alright song.\n\nAround the World - This is a very loud track. A mix of a lot when it comes to the beat and production. A lot of drums, etc. I like it a lot.\n\nCircles - Right away the beat caught me. Then Ms. Aguilera's attitude on this song is tough! It's basically an \"F You\" to the haters. It's so catchy and something that will be on repeat.\n\nBest of Me - Another ballad type song. This song is basically about not sacrificing yourself to the detriment of someone else. Of not lowering yourself to the low level of someone else, and not playing their games anymore by tarnishing yourself. Positive message of not breaking yourself to someone you no longer recognize because of someone else.\n\nJust a Fool ft Blake Shelton - Very interesting collaboration, because I never really listened to a Blake Shelton song before. But neither artists overpowered one another, and this bluesy\/country-lite song actually works. If released, I think it would do great in the country market.\n\nLight Up the Sky - Positive uplifting song. Love the song. You just have to listen to it in it's entirely to hear the message and feel the song.\n\nEmpty Words - An inspiring and spiritually elevating song. A standout to me. It is a long the same lines as Circles, maybe even it's counterpart - same message, just without the bad or crass words.\n\nShut Up - I do not know if the beeping was a purposeful aspect of the song, but it can go either way for some people. For me it was distracting and a bit annoying, especially when she does curse in the song. I wish we could get the full experience of the song. Otherwise it's an alright song.\n\nYour Body [Martin Garrix Remix] - A solid dance remix.\n\nThere are some very interesting themes in this album, the standouts to me being positivity, love, redemption and confidence in oneself. This is a really great musical effort that I hope redeems Christina Aguilera with the fans that did not come out and support her last effort&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/BIONIC-DELUXE-Explicit\/dp\/B003G4DFRC\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">BIONIC - DELUXE (Explicit)<\/a>, which I actually really liked. She has moved more towards the pop-ish side of the spectrum where as Bionic was very experimental with a lot of electronica and Euro-pop elements, but this album totally works for me as well. But I can always appreciate an artist who can sing as well as write, which she has credits on a majority of this album.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I'm aware that \"More Than Words\" is a rather atypical hit for the band Extreme, which leans more toward the harder spectrum of music than a mellow guitar song would suggest.

It's a very simple song in its message, in the instrumentation that consists solely of a single guitar, and in the laid-back and unadorned (and un-auto-tuned) voices of the singers.  And sometimes, a simple song works nicely.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"BOOM! Bjork just suprised us with her follow-up to Biophilia.  She announced her album over the weekend and then it leaked in full a day later and then we get it officially released today.  I've literally only listened to the album twice and as any Bjork fans will tell you, two listens is not enough to take in the breadth of genius on a Bjork album.  With that said, upon 2 listens, I am happy to report that Bjork has returned with one of her most elegant, lush, albums since Vespertine.  PHEW!  Thanks for this fabulous return to form.\n\nThe Best:\nStone Milker is a grand beautiful opener and excited for it to be part of the Bjork music catalogue.\nLion Song continues with the grandness of Stone Milker and  while there isn't any new territory here, it takes one back to the Homogenic\/Vespertine days.\nFamily continues with the homogenic\/verspertine wails and the drum n bassy'esque sound.  There is no catchy chorus to latch on to with this track but where it lacks in catchiness, it makes up for in its haunting energy.\n\nThe Good:\nHistory of Touches goes back to the feeling of the last album except the instruments are much more soothing.\nBlack Lake is a 10 minute track that increases in intensity as the song builds.  Very similar again to the vibe of the last album.  Pullls at the heart strings.\nAtom Dance is the collabo with Antony.  Bjork owns the first 4-5 minutes of the track and then Antony kicks in.  His unique vocals have been warped so they sounds even more unique.  The song then goes into them singing in unison which is the most enjoyable part of this 8 minute track.  She wails, he wails, the strings, the drums kicking....emotionally intense.\n\nThe Unique:\nNotGet confuses me alittle.  The entire song it feels like her vocals have not been aligned correctly with the track and theres this pull.  This one is hard for me to get into and the musical accompaniment is very unappealing to me.\nMouth Mantra has a unique musical track.  Reminds me of 80's video game sounds.\n\nUltimately this is her break-up album from Matthew Barney.  I have some thoughts on that.  They've been together from the early 2000's.  Her last accessible album was Verspertine.  The bjork that came after was clearly influenced by this very avant-garde artist.  Her work before him is significantly different.  It is easier to follow and grasp and understand.  Everything since has been creative, brilliant, complex, hard to follow, etc.\nAs a Bjork fan, I hope this is the final piece of the Matthew Barney era.  I am truly excited for what the next Bjork album will have in store for us.  For now I will enjoy this album as best as I can and look forward to her next new creation and sound.  The Barney era is over.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I love it!!!! I'm 24, so growing up, I was raised on classic rock, and (new?) rock. My family has always been a bit racist, so anything black musicians wrote, was terrible, except K.C. and the Sunshine band, since they had two or three white guys. Fortunately for me, I never cared about race, so I made friends of every color, and was able to broadly expand my horizons on the music front. I've never really cared for R&B, and still don't.  But some Rap, and Funk, really hit the spot. Earth, Wind, and Fire, was one of those funk bands. I LOVE Funk\/Disco! Even my family hears me listen to EWF, and says \"Hey! That is really good! Who is that?!\" But, of course when I say \"EWF\" they say \"Oh, It's alright\". I KNOW THEY CAN FEEL THE FUNK!!!!!! They know it is great! EWF is probably my favorite, when it comes to funk! Anyway, enough about racist families. If you like Funk, and\/or R&B. You can't go wrong with EWF!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Firstly, I am a huge Jewel fan.  She has written some of the most gorgeous ballads ever.  At first, I was disappointed to see her change her style for this latest offering.  The cover looks cheap and countless reviews slammed the album in general.  But let's not give up on Jewel so quickly.  I admit, I don't like the first single from 0304 \"Intuition\" because it is rather forgetful pop (and won't go down as a classic), but you cannot deny that it appealed to many younger people.  The second single \"Stand\" really appeals to me, on the other hand.  It is a very catchy song, and while it is not traditional Jewel, it shows that she can be versatile like any star out there. And at the end of the day, isn't that what is important about a singer?  To be able to re-invent themself from time to time?  Madonna has done it countless times and people accepted it.  I consider \"0304\" an opportunity that Jewel took to try something different.  She never said she wouldn't go back to her traditional style in the future.  Unfortunately at the moment, folk type music isn't that popular ... so that's another reason why Jewel is trying something different.  In 1978, the Rolling Stones released a disco single (Miss You) because that's what the public were really into then - even though rock was their normal style. Going with the flow, in other words. Times will change yet again, and folk music will be what the public want.  Cycles ...\n\"0304\" is Jewel in 2003.  It's not the classic of \"pieces of you\" or \"Spirit\", but it's not as vile as many reviewers have stated.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"Rob Dougan is justly best-known for his track \"Clubbed to Death,\" which first appeared when Mo'Wax was a can't-miss label. And the cinematic quality which marked that track (as well as the track itself) reappear on his debut album, _Furious Angels_. More interesting, Dougan adds his hoarse vocals to his creations, which veer more towards country-western than to pure electronic music. It's an interesting combination, if not an entirely successful one. The title track has a gospel chorus that add tension to some potentially overwrough lyrics. \"Will You Follow Me?\" sounds as if it came straight off a soundtrack -- John Williams would be proud. Not sure what Mr. Williams would think of the dirge-like \"Left Me for Dead,\" however. At times, Dougan sounds as if he's straining his voice in an attempt at emotion, and it's at odds with the elegant orchestrations. When he doesn't try as hard, as on \"There's Only Me,\" he gets across a sense of desperation and sadness much better, as does the melancholy trip-hop and warbling falsetto of \"Nothing At All.\" Not surprisingly, on the instrumental disc, the tracks in which Dougan's vocals proved problematic feel improved with just the strings, but the ones in which the vocals were an asset feel slightly empty. But the most surprising track would be \"Drinking Song,\" which has much of the simplicity and directness of the Pogues' \"Fairytale of New York.\" It brings romanticism to a drunken haze -- reminiscing with a gravelly voice.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Originally recorded as an LP in 1972, \"Amazing Grace\" remains one of my favorite recordings. In this expanded CD version, David Nathan in his liner notes says that \"Amazing Grace\" was Aretha's best-selling album, information that should not come as a surprise to anyone who has ever heard it. She recorded it live at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Los Angeles with the Southern California Community  Choir directed by the Reverend James Cleveland on two consecutive nights, January 13 and 14, 1972.\n\nThe CD has everything going for it: the enthusiasm of the audience, the spontaneity possible only in a live performance, the beautiful gospel piano accompaniment by Cleveland (except for two songs), the commentary by both Cleveland and Aretha's father, the Reverend C. L. Franklin (\"Aretha never left the church\"), the angelic voices of the choir and finally that voice. No one ever said that Ms. Franklin sounds like anyone else on earth, and she never sang better than in this recording session. She has a tremendous range and can do anything she wants to do with a melody, even to singing an acceptable version of Puccini's \"Nessum Dorma.\"\n\nBesides the title song, Aretha sings a glorious arrangement of Marvin Gaye's \"Wholy Holy,\" the Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"You'll Never Walk Alone,\" and \"How I Got Over.\" She turns Carol King's \"You've Got A Friend\" into gospel and then seques into Tommy Dorsey's familiar \"Precious Lord, Take My Hand.\" Ms. Franklin sings \"Precious Memories with Cleveland and does a fantastic version of \"What A Friend We Have In Jesus.\" If I had to pick a favorite, a difficult decision, I would have to go with \"Never Grow Old\" with Aretha accompanying herself on the piano.\n\nThis music arises above gospel music and appeals to music lovers of all colors and religions. The CD should be put in a time capsule.","classification":5,"fold":7}

And the tiny one second drum break around 2:01 is cool.

{"text":"This second round with the Blue Ridge Rangers \/ John Fogerty is probably largely as one would expect it. Very accomplished and well-played! What it needs is perhaps a few more surprises. The traditional country are largely allowed to draw the picture. The song choice is probably okay; a mixture of well-known standards and a few more obscure country songs, but in either case the arrangements contain few surprises.\n\nThe album opens well with John Prine's \"Paradise\", which probably has all a good classic country song should.  Among the following songs Rick Nelson's \"Garden Party\" definitely is a number that deserves to be revisited; unfortunately the arrangement is so faithfull to Nelson's original that experiment almost seems superfluous.\n\nActually I first really woke up when the tones of track 7th were to be heard. Where was it I'd heard this song before?? - Oh, yes. . It was Fogerty's own \"Change in the Weather\" from the overlooked album \"Eye of the Zombie\". Definitely one of this album's highlights and more \"CCR\" than the original version, which is also very good.\n\n\"Moody River\" was a nice beat, and it is altogether a fine melancholy tune.\n\nThe final track is Everly Brothers' \"When Will I Be Loved\", which is one of the few songs which has really been given a different treatment - a more rocking arrangement, and with a surprise guest vocal by Bruce Springsteen.\n\nAll in all a solid album from Fogerty, which however, contains only few surprises.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"At a different time, Little Caesar would have been big. They certainly deserved to make it with this self-titled debut that was released in 1990, at a time when style ruled over substance. Heaven forbid that the band looked like a bunch of bikers and weren't pretty like Poison, Winger, White Lion, and a slew of other more successful bands. And none of those bands made an album this good. They also brought the goods live as evidenced on that year's tour with Kiss and Slaughter. I saw them on this tour and they blew the more popular Slaughter away. The fans loved them. This album has a great balance of hard rock anthems, emotional power ballads, and soulful tracks. The best known song is their very good rocking version of Aretha Franklin's \"Chain of Fools\" which received some radio airplay. \"Hard Times\" is a fantastic anthem while \"Down N' Dirty\", \"Rock N' Roll State of Mind\", and \"Drive It Home\" are good time hard rockers that work very well. Their soulful side reveals itself on their awesome cover of the R&B standard \"I Wish It Would Rain\" and their own \"Midtown\". And as great as all of these tracks are, their ballads were even better as \"In Your Arms\" has a fantastic chorus and a great vocal from Ron Young while the harder and more melancholy \"From the Start\" is a killer with a memorable melody. Other strong tracks include \"Little Queenie\", \"Wrong Side of the Tracks\", and the driving \"Cajun Panther\" which would be featured in the movie, \"Another 48 Hours\". This is an awesome album and one of the best of the era and has aged very well. Highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"They rose to the top of the pop music world virtually overnight! This talented quintet, originally known as The Versatiles, formed in Los Angeles in 1966 and within a year they had secured a recording contract with Johnny Rivers' fledgling Soul City label. Rivers loved the sound but hated their name and as a result group member Ron Townsend came up with the name we would all come to know so well...The 5th Dimension. And it did not take very long for the group to make its presence felt. Their very first release \"Go Where You Wanna Go\" cracked the Billboard Top 20. Just five months later the group would score a major hit with Jimmy Webb's \"Up Up and Away\". Yes, the 5th Dimension was on its way! Over the next six years the group would prove to be a dominant force in American popular music amassing a total of nearly 30 charted singles and a dozen hit albums.\n\nOver the years the 5th Dimension recorded a number of tunes by the noted American songwriter, singer and pianist Laura Nyro. In September 1969 Soul City records released \"Wedding Bell Blues\" a tune that Nyro had originally recorded in 1966. The song zoomed to the top of the charts and stayed there for three big weeks. It was the group's second biggest single of all-time. This is the original hit recording that has been remastered for your enjoyment.  Simply outstanding!","classification":5,"fold":7}

There are some great tunes here and this collection plays better than the snooze fest that was found on the AT LAST CD.\n\nFUNNEL OF LOVE has Cyndis trademark vocal tics and hiccups and they work wonderfully in this context.\n\nDETOUR sounds like it was recorded in the 1950s by Kitty Wells.\n\nMISTY BLUE is a dynamic vocal performance, period. This and HARD CANDY CHRISTMAS are probably the best ones on the CD.\n\nWALKNG AFTER MIDNIGHT is one of the weak links only because no one can sing this like Patsy Cline and the arrangement isn't as atmospheric as the original; the lack of male backup is detrimental. I FALL TO PIECES works much better even though its a carbon-copy version of Patsys.\n\nHEARTACHES BY THE NUMBER has a vocal that is typical Cyndi and an average arrangement.\n\nEND OF THE WORLD is less cringe-worthy than the syrupy Skeeter Davis version.\n\nYOURE THE REASON OUR KIDS ARE UGLY with Vince Gill is a cute duet with lots of funny banter and it works better than the drowsy Willie Nelson duet on the country-blues number NIGHT LIFE.\n\nI WANNA BE A COWBOYS SWEETHEART is noteworthy for the yodeling if nothing else.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"This song's mix has a history that fans like to harp on and on about. JJLC was released originally on\nZZ Tops' third album, \"Tres Hombres\" album, in 1973.  It was the band's breakthrough album. Push\nto the mid-80s when CDs made the scene and the original '73 mix was discontinued. The CD mix\ninstruments seemed to sound very different, especially the drums. The mid-80s CD version was the\nonly one available for over 20 years. When the album was remastered in 2006 (this version) the\noriginal 1973 mix was used. Hallelujah, brother.\n\nThe song also has many people trying to decide the meaning of the lyrics as well. Anything from\nthe spiritual side to a gospel radio station to drug deals. To be quite honest unless the writers\ncome forward and explain, line by line, what their original meaning, or intent was, I really don't\ncare. Here is why: The Music.\n\nThis music is so blues-drenched, with it open ringing tones and walk-down chords on the refrain,\nthat all I can think of is that this was handed to ZZ Top as a gift from the Blues Gods from on high.\nIt seems so much like a classic blues tune in many ways. You got some nasty 12-bar blues, add\nsome honky tonk and finish off with a growling, wailing, ringing 6 string electric. That stinging\nlead punctuates your soul to the core. Never mind that Billy Gibbons played it through a '55 Strat.\nOh, and don't forget the gravely can-barely-sing vocals. Nice and Cool. I wouldn't want it any other\nway.\n\nThe album also sported their big hit single, \"La Grange\", basically a well-done homage to the\ngreat John Lee Hooker. \"La Grange\" is still in regular rotation on radio stations to this day. I would\nmuch prefer to hear \"Jesus Just Left Chicago\" over any other ZZ Top song. To me this song was\nborn classic and remains that way to this day. Some feel \"Tres Hombres\" was their pinnacle work.\nJJLC, I feel, had a lot to do with them hitting their stride on the album. Have a listen and immerse\nyourself in the decades of blues influences ZZ Top has synergized thorough their souls.","classification":5,"fold":7}

I think it's considered to be the most played song ever, by whoever keeps track of such things. Its worth getting this album for that track alone, although if you are download friendly then you could shortcut that process and simply purchase the track all by itself.\n\nBut if you did that, you'd miss the 21 other great songs here, starting with 'Walkin' after Midnight', and continuing one after another to transport us to those days in the late 1950's and early 1960's when Patsy Cline was at the top of her career.\n\nThe only better collection for just about anyone short of Patsy Cline fanatics would be this one -&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Patsy-Cline-Gold\/dp\/B0007OY44M\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Patsy Cline: Gold<\/a>&nbsp;- that includes all of the 22 tracks on this 'Definitive' disc, plus 10 more, spread over 2 CDs.\n\nThis was my choice, and I'm happy with it.

{"text":"This cd is difficult to review.  I made sure I listened to it many times before writing this.  I am a huge Jennifer Hudson fan and don't necessarily agree that she so much had to prove she could sing with this cd as show she could be a competitive cohesive artist.  We all know she can sing.  American idol and DREAMGIRLS showed us that. (And we are reminded with the inclusion of AND I'M TELLING YOU I'M NOT GOING here.)\n\nStudios and producers can take a person with minimal talent and produce a very appealing cd that showcases them well.  Here we have a singer with amazing pipes and range who can carry an album by those qualities alone and what do we get?  Total overproduction and songs that are just not up to the caliber she deserves.\n\nThe cd opens very promisingly with the single SPOTLIGHT with strong and emotive vocals.  Then IF THIS ISN'T LOVE comes on and the quality of song definitely diminishes.  It's very generic but Jennifer does get to show her strong vocals at the end.  POCKETBOOK with Ludacris is just silly and WHAT'S WRONG(GO AWAY) with T-Pain is ridiculous.  So unecessary and just does not work.  The static effect used with T-Pain is irritating and Jennifer merely floats through.  GIVING MYSELF is the first ballad and it is ok.  The song quality just doesn't cut it though and it works adequately.\n\nHalfway through the cd starts to come into its own.  YOU PULLED ME THOUGH is a better soulful ballad and Jennifer again gets to showcase those pipes.  She soars range wise and emotively in the duet with Fantasia I'M HIS ONLY WOMAN and CAN'T STOP THE RAIN and WE GON' FIGHT are both priceless - highlights of the cd.  She soars on both and showcase her amazing abilities as an artist.  Then INVISIBLE comes and it does just that.  It's a rather forgetful song.  Including AND I'M TELLING YOU doesn't really fit - it merely shows what Jennifer is capable of with the right material.  Even the final gospel track is ok - excellent vocal performance of an adequate song.\n\nI wish this had been so much more.  Clive Davis gets so much credit for his talent but his producing skills here get a very low grade.  He was given pure raw talent and he surrounded her with nonsense.  Never are Jennifer Hudsons vocals not supreme and heavenly.  This just won't be the cd to start the true music career she deserves and is capable of having.  There are not enough songs here to be singles and the set lacks any true continuity.  Noit to say I can't enjoy it.  I really do for I just love Jennifer Hudson's voice and abilities.  I just can't help but wish she had been dealt a better hand.  Till the next cd I will enjoy this one.  SPOTLIGHT, CAN'T STOP THE RAIN, WE GON' FIGHT and a few others will carry me through.\n\nThis 3 star review is certainly not a judgement of the talents of Jennifer Hudson.  Those would receive a 5+, but rather an honest review of the material on the cd.  I do recommend purchasing it.  It is enjoyable and she will become a legendary talent in time.  Enjoy this in the meantime.","classification":3,"fold":7}

Etta James went through something similar, but she managed to get her act together. One can only wonder what Amy was capable of had she put out another album. People keep calling her sound \"retro soul.\" I disagree: I would call it wonderfully \"trashy pop\": she was like the bad Ronette, or perhaps the lead singer of a modern day Shangri-Las called The Shangri-Lows.

The only real hit here is \"The Sound Of Silence\", and while that's excellent, my two favorites are \"Bleeker Street\" and \"Sparrow\". There's just something about those two tracks, and really the whole first side that's amazing. Maybe because they're so simple, I really feel like I'm being read a story, but to music. Anyway, all three of those songs are thankfully on \"The Essential Simon And Garfunkel\", which is probably best for casual fans.

That being said, after first listen I was disheartened.  However, after repeated listens, it's quickly grown on me!.\n\nThere are many great songs on 48:13: Eez-Eh, Stevie, Bumblebee, Treat, Bow.  I do feel these would have been great-ER had Serge, the creative mastermind behind Kasabian, who also took on the role of Producer for 48:13, done less production work with dubbing, overdubbing & electronics. Both Tom's (lead singer) & Serge's (backing & some lead) vocals are in fine form.  The lyrics are a bit repetitive.  Serge is definitely flexing his creative \"muscles\" on 48:13 & I have to believe that's a good thing which will continue to carry Kasabian forward rather than repeating themselves.  It is definitely more electronic than earlier releases, but it does work after all!  Just don't be anticipating another West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum or Velociraptor and if you don't discount it after the first full listen, you'll probably grow to appreciate it very quickly.  Kasabian don't usually release the same sounds twice; 48:13 just goes a little further \"left of the dial\"!!  I'd strongly recommend going for the 48:13 Deluxe version which comes with a bonus live DVD because Kasabian live are always a \"Treat\"!!!

Of that early quintet, baritone Fambrough, bass Patric Jackson and tenor Billy Henderson appear on their self-titled debut 1973 ATLANTIC Records LP (SD 7256). Technically considered an original, tenor Bobby Smith replaced James Edwards only weeks after the one-time Domingoes were formed. He's here, as is tenor Phillip Wynne, co-lead with Smith and a 1971 replacement for G.C. Cameron, who chose to stay with MOTOWN when the group left for ATLANTIC.\n\nThis album was a huge seller in its day. Certified Gold, an R&B #1 and #14 on BILLBOARD's 200.\nProducer, arranger, conductor Thom Bell also plays keyboards.\n\nOriginally an \"A\" side, \"How Could I Let You Get Away\" peaked at #77 on the Hot 100\nand reached #14 on BILLBOARD's R&B chart.

{"text":"Taylor Swift returns after a two-year hiatus with 2012's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Red\/dp\/B008XNZMOU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Red<\/a>, arguably the year's biggest album, seeking to extend upon her previous successes (2008's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Fearless\/dp\/B001EYGOEM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fearless<\/a>&nbsp;and 2010's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Speak-Now\/dp\/B003WTE886\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Speak Now<\/a>).  Red serves as more of a departure for Swift, delivering more pop sensibilities than previous efforts have exhibited.  This pop nature has been evidenced in full fruition via singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" and \"I Knew You Were Trouble,\" both produced by one of pop's `it' teams in Max Martin and Shellback. Country may be ever so disappointed by Swift's pop stylings, though should appreciate the fact she balances enough singer-songwriter cuts. Overall, Red is another intriguing release by the 22-year old star.\n\n\"State of Grace\" opens possessing a sound pop\/rock blend with country elements more understated and minimal here.  Written by Swift, she and Nathan Chapman produce the cut, characterized by pummeling drums and electric guitar.  Swift's songwriting remains sharp, most notably on the succinct, though emotive chorus: \"And I never saw you coming, and I'll never be the same...\" Ultimately, Swift `pitches' well here, with the only quibble being it's five minute length.\n\n\"Red,\" also penned by Swift, loses no momentum and successfully contrasts \"State of Grace\" by trending more country\/pop than the opener. Lyrically, Swift continues to allure, promoting cutting edge lines like \"Losing him was blue like I'd never known\/missing him was dark grey all alone\/forgetting him was like trying to show somebody you've never met\/but loving him was red...\" Ultimately, \"Red\" keeps the momentum afloat.\n\n\"Treacherous\" loses a bit of the luster of \"State of Grace\" and \"Red,\" but ultimately remains consistent.  Swift chooses a more restrained approach throughout, which is a pro.  She does covered ever so slightly on the bridge, which features more production and intensity than the majority of the song.  Pop cut \"I Knew You Were Trouble.\" is stronger, contrasting the restraint of it predecessor in favor of the pop gimmickry of producers Max Martin and Shellback.  Most shocking is on the incredible hook when Martin and Shellback throw in a dubstep bass line and whacky electro-influenced synths.  It shouldn't work, but Swift actually delivers more vocal edge and personality than we've experienced previously.  The songwriting suffers none: \"Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in\/so shame on me now, flew me to places I'd never been\/'til you put me down\/oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in\/so shame on me now, flew me to places I'd never been\/nowI'm lying on the  cold hard ground.\" Verdict? A+.\n\n\"All Too Well\" atones for Swift's more country-leaning fans, opting for a more conservative direction and slowing down the tempo after the ferociousness of \"I Knew You Were Trouble.\" The cut possesses a sound rhythmic flow and the chorus is not concrete, but possesses lyrical variations given each iteration.  The main quibble is length, which clocks in at 5  minutes\n\n\"22\" contrasts country, swapping for care-free pop: \"Uh oh, I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22\/everything will be alright if you keep me next to you\/you don't know about me but I bet you want to\/everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22...\" As always, Max Martin and Shellback provide Swift with an excellent backdrop.  There is little to quibble about here, but perhaps Swift does overreach vocally as she tries to soar. Overall though, \"22\" is sassily excellent.\n\n\"I Almost Do\" lacks the hit potential of the pop cuts, but maintains a sense of consistency.  Never fear as the feisty lead single \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" proceeds, maintaining high energy.  One feels that Swift really `lets go of her cool' and is reveling in her youth.  The message may be stemmed out of a breakup\/heartbreak, but Swift spins it as one of 2012's most fun and memorable songs: \"We are never ever ever ever getting back together...you go talk to you friends talk\/to my friends talk to me\/but we are never ever ever getting back together...\"\n\n\"Stay, Stay, Stay\" shifts gears incorporating ukelele, which gives the cut a folk-pop\/tropical sound (think Colbie Caillat).  Swift is joined by Gary Lightbody (Snow Patrol) on the piano-driven \"The Last Time,\" which is slower in tempo, but yields some sound vocal chemistry between the two.  \"The Last Time\" works, but is a bit `sleepy.' \"Holy Ground\" proceeds, produced by Jeff Bhasker. Quicker possessing a country-rock sensibility, \"Holy Ground\" lacks the spark of the best, but remains enjoyable and consistent.\n\n\"Sad Beautiful Tragic\" features nice lower register vocals by Swift.  The balance between country and singer-songwriter idioms is well executed.  Bhasker produces once more on \"The Lucky One,\" which features more memorable lyrics from Swift. Both cuts are solid, but pale in comparison to \"State of Grace,\" \"I Knew You Were Trouble,\" \"22,\" or \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\"\n\n\"Everything Has Changed,\" featuring Ed Sheeran, produces a cut that competes with the very best of Red.  Produced by Butch Walker and co-written by Swift and Sheeran, \"Everything Has Changed\" showcases superb vocal chemistry between the two.  The chorus works spectacularly: \"Cause all I know is we said hello\/and your eyes look like coming home\/all I know is a simple name, everything has changed\/all I know is you held the door\/you'll be mine and I'll be yours\/all I know since yesterday is everything has changed...\"\n\"Starlight\" bridges country and pop quite effectively, though stands out less than \"Everything Has Changed.\" \"Begin Again,\" a preliminary single, closes the effort solidly, though doesn't eclipse better singles.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Red\/dp\/B008XNZMOU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Red<\/a>&nbsp;isn't necessarily Taylor Swift`s best album compared to the quality of the work she's released, but shows Swift able and willing to stretch her wings.  The crossover appeal possibilities have already shown themselves and are evidence of why Red  will sell one million-plus its first week. Highly recommended.","classification":4,"fold":7}

Musically, she showcased being the world's great soulful singer, whom not only made covers brilliantly, but songs all her own. The biggest example is I Will Always Love You from The Bodyguard. The song is just as intimate and beautiful from her soulful heart and voice alone. Something that stands taller beyond the tests of time. The song is honestly the biggest movie song of all time, and definitely is the most classic cover she had ever done in a lifetime. Her Dolly Parton cover even stands taller than any song that anyone has made within the past several years.

Although THIS CD displays his incredible voice and makes him a STAR...I'm saving my FIVE star review for his NEXT CD.

Where Luther had a touch of female in his phrasing (which made his voice incredible)...Teddy's voice was ALL testosterone, without apologies.  Forceful, direct and demanding, Teddy's singing reminded me of old Southern Negro field hollers.  All due respect to David Ruffin, Eddie Levert, Dennis Edwards...even Gerald Levert (excellent ALL)...but they're urban...they're missing that \"pig feet and hot sauce\".  Teddy had the quintescential southern black, arrogant, macho, R&B song voice...and during the 70's, I'm sure it made many white people (especially women) uncomfortable in various ways.\n\nJaheim has the same voice...the same approach.  What played well in the 70's...continues to play.  His \"ghetto-ness\" might turn some off...but I hope he doesn't completely drop that thug affect...yet.

{"text":"...seductive, spellbinding.  There are probably many other words out there that can describe this record, but the five I've mentioned are probably the closest that will match the feeling I get from listening to it.  Imagine a dark, tranquil atmosphere with shimmering electronic music and bassline grooves and narrative, soulful vocals in the background.  \"Mezzanine\" perfectly fits this description!  Some of the highlights include \"Angel\" where the music starts soft and then builds up into a screaming frenzy.  Or how about \"Teardrop\" (w\/former Cocteau Twins vocalist Elizabeth Fraser) which features an angelic voice, an acoustic guitar, and the same shimmering electronics.  I could go on and on.  But I think it's best that you go out and buy this fine record and experience it for yourself.  If I'm not mistaken, it was one of SPIN magazine's top 20 records of 1998.

He's gotten the attention of some vets in the game like Nas, and of course MF DOOM who produced this entire project and shows up to rap on a few track. The production here is standard MF DOOM stuff, but it works. Nehru goes over these beats really well. He is dope for his age, and he'll only get better.\n\nMy only complaint is the song \"Mean The Most\". Kind of a boring beat and lame hook. The rest of this project is dope though.

{"text":"Paul Stanley is a hero of mine. He and Mr. Simmons wrote the sountrack to my childhood. I always loved his voice and appreciated the fact that he showed some class, unlike Gene who stamps his name on anything that can make a buck. But i must admit to being a bit disappointed at this cd. Aside from the fact that he used co-writers on every track, i am very unimpressed with the quality of some songs here. Almost as if it were a connect the dots pop record. The guitars are a bit in the background and some of the cheesy 80's style keyboards are too much for my taste. A few tracks have potential, but overall an average cd that took a very long time to come out.\n\nThe fact that he had years to put this together and he had no contractual obligation to put out anything got me excited. I may have expected too much, but i don't believe so. All i wanted was a nice rock record with balls. Maybe in the vein of some of the 80s (Animalize) style Kiss records that were very good. And i do understand that Paul is in his 50's now and his musical taste is a bit different at the moment. I will grant him that. But this album is very cliched lyrically and the music is quite light. The most surprising thing is that with all the additional writers it is very generic. Thats what bothers me the most. Paul is a great songwriter in his own right, and this album does not let him shine. But this is what he wanted. Trying to cater to the 40+ age group with a light AOR style cd.\n\nKiss fans will buy this so im sure it will sell ok. And it is still better than Genes crap as*hole cd. Just wish it was a bit heavier.","classification":3,"fold":7}

Their renditions of some classics from Whitney Houston, to Bon Jovi, all the way to Madonna have shown that they are just not as brilliant as what they were. For their rendition of Adele's Rumour Has It & Someone Like You, feels absolutely awful. Yet when it has came down to Adele, she has really brought out a absolutely strong vibe from her rhythms with Someone Like You and the definitive song of the year, Rolling In The Deep. Even if you're a fan of Glee, I would definitely recommend that you pass this one up, and just stick with Adele's originals instead.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":7}
{"text":"The Essential Cyndi Lauper really should have been a two CD set. While we get a good number of her biggest hits on this album, there isn't quite enough to satisfy me. Although the material that we do get is wonderful; where are some more very good tunes? At any rate, Cyndi worked hard to produce great music for her fans; and just one listen to this album proves it. In addition, the quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is very well done.\n\n\"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\" starts the CD off with a huge number that was one of Cyndi's earliest hits. \"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\" celebrates women who just want to enjoy their relationships with men without long term commitments; and Cyndi delivers this like a pro! The number is full of positive energy and it's great music for dancing even today. \"Money Changes Everything\" was another early hit for Cyndi; this has that mid `80s dance flavor to it and Cyndi's really good diction enhances the number even more. \"Who Let In The Rain\" features Cyndi front and center--right where she belongs! \"Who Let In The Rain\" is a fine number that proves Cyndi can easily tackle a rock flavored ballad to make it take flight!\n\n\"She Bop\" was always one of my very favorite Cyndi Lauper hits; this hit the airwaves big time during the summer of 1984 and I remember going to dances where the DJs played this very often. \"She Bop\" has a great, power-packed melody that is also rather catchy and it remains one of Cyndi Lauper's best hits ever. \"Time After Time\" also comes from the mid 1980s; and Cyndi does this wonderfully. \"I Drove All Night\" comes from Cyndi's great album entitled A Night To Remember and just one listen proves that Cyndi is a champ! \"Hat Full Of Stars\" is a ballad from the album of the same name; and listen for \"All Through The Night.\" \"All Through The Night\" is one of Cyndi Lauper's best hits ever--period. The percussion enhances the musical arrangement and Cyndi's excellent diction makes her performance even better. \"All Through The Night\" is another one of my very favorite Cyndi Lauper tunes and it deserves its place on this CD.\n\n\"When You Were Mine\" comes from Cyndi's first album entitled She's So Unusual; and Cyndi's cover of the song originally done by Prince really shines bright. \"True Colors\" comes from the album of the same; Cyndi does this with great sensitivity and the guitar work enhances the melody quite a bit. Awesome! \"Unhook The Stars\" plays with major and minor keys as Cyndi sings this very well; and the album ends strong with a great number from the movie The Goonies entitled \"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough.\" I agree with other reviewers who write that this last number is a most welcome addition to this album.\n\nI always liked Cyndi Lauper; so while I love the tunes on this album I must admit that it's not as complete as it should be. There should be several other songs here. Specifically, I would have wanted extra songs like \"Hole In My Heart (All The Way To China);\" \"My First Night Without You;\" \"Ballad Of Cleo & Joe;\" \"Boy Blue\" and maybe even one or two more. That's a missed opportunity; and I can only hope that we get a better Cyndi Lauper \"essential\" collection two CD set soon. Nevertheless, I still recommend this album for Lauper's fans; and it makes a great starter CD for people just discovering Cyndi's talents. It's also a fine CD for people who merely want a small sampling of Cyndi Lauper's incredible artistry.","classification":4,"fold":7}

Musically, they have been absent from the scene for a long time, while Steven Tyler did well on his brief stint on American Idol.

The song feels like a throwback to the ballads that Aerosmith had that were strong back in the 90's like Crazy and Cryin'. The song isn't a bad song, but honestly not as driven as their other songs had shown before. I really am eager to hear what is next for Aerosmith from their what their next single is going to be.

The title track begins with rain & thunder sounds before guitar & keyboards float seamlessly.  \"Away\" is a gentle track with chimes and guitar that transport us to a dreamlike wistful place.  \"Inland Returned\" is a lovely track that starts as a little guitar melody and seems to transform into a minuet with flutes and fanciful percussion.  The set concludes with one of its strongest melodies on \"With You\" that has some punchy percussion and brings this journey to a close.

{"text":"Bruno Mars 24K Magic is pure R&B radio bliss and showcases how the genre evolved over the years from 60s soul (the fun, energetic Perm) to New Jack Swing (Finesse). \"Versace On The Floor\" is reminiscent of Gregory Abbott's \"Shake You Down\". \"Too Good To Say Goodbye\" & \"Straight Up and Down\" feel like classic unreleased ballads also.\n\nI grew up on R&B, so this album is really nostalgic and close to my heart. There is an awesome wave of current artists dipping deeply into 80s nostalgia and doing it well, may I add. (If you like 80s synth pop with sexy sax, check out The Midnight). Bruno Mars contribute to that wave in a huge way. The album could have used just one more song to round it out; however, not one of the songs on the album is a miss. Cant wait to catch them on tour. 24K Magic is another Bruno Mars classic!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Anyone with direct experience of infidelity - the numbers seem to grow annually - would probably really appreciate having an international platform on which to air their grievances. The concept definitely has its appeal: one person betrays another and the betrayer receives a presumably well-deserved dressing-down accessible to thousands or perhaps millions of people. Who wouldn't want that kind of outlet? Though the threat of such exposure likely won't eliminate or even reduce these situations from humanity's intimate relations, it may provide some consolation and opportunities for healing to the betrayed. Of course, the number of people with feasible recourse to mass accusation remains somewhat on an infinitesimal level. Most people turn to the obvious sources of family and friends when confronted with a demeaning and egregious loss of trust in a loved one. Perhaps social media now serves as an additional platform for venting loss on an even wider scale, at least for those seeking it, in our increasingly attention-hungry society. Others may choose to suffer and heal in private, camouflaged from the potential messiah complexes and morbid curiosities that inevitably lurk in any public sphere. Either way, those who both possess a large audience and also wish to share their damaged feelings, warts and all, with a wider population may indirectly assist those without such means in coping with their own deeply personal experiences of amorous disloyalty. The realization that even prominent public figures can face personal acts of shameful dishonesty within their own inner circles might help comfort those more lonely sufferers simply by the mere suggestion that others do experience such wrenching and humiliating pain. These same others also overcome their losses and regenerate their lives afterwards, often for the better. As such, celebrities who outwardly display their emotional upheavals through their work do risk charges of narcissism or puerile selfishness. \"Entertain us,\" some fans may exhort, \"don't whine at us!\" Yet these explicit and seemingly self-serving displays also potentially enrich and support those who seek more from entertainment than mere sensual pleasure.\n\nAlong those lines, some may have rolled their eyes upon hearing rumors of Bjork's so-called \"infidelity album.\" \"Here we go again,\" they may have sighed, \"another celebrity had another inevitable celebrity breakup and she now wants the rest of us to wallow with her in her emotional misery.\" Given some of the history of artists venting their personal frustrations and disappointments through their songwriting, this reaction seems somewhat understandable. Not only that, Bjork often comes under fire for \"pretentiousness\" because of her unabashed artistic and experimental approach to music and image. The esoteric title of the album, \"Vulnicura,\" meaning \"cure for wounds,\" probably didn't quiet the \"snooty police.\" Not only that, some former fans have decried her move away from more \"accessible\" material, often citing the earlier album \"Homogenic\" as a yet unsurpassed peak. Though undoubtedly a fantastic album, Bjork made it clear that she had no intention of simply repeating her crowd-pleasing, best-selling, most talked about efforts. She moved on. Subsequent albums have met with almost equal praise and criticism as the music became even more complex, cutting edge and at times approaching the avant-garde. The rhythms became more staccato and jarring on \"Biophilia\" as the album's ambience seemed to simultaneously encompass both entire chunks of the universe and the most microscopic existential realms. \"Vulnicura\" continues the electronic exploration while incorporating compositional elements of \"Homogenic,\" \"Biophilia\" and aspects of \"Volta,\" but nonetheless it creates something distinct. Many of its pieces and themes apparently emerged via the healing process that accompanied a painful breakup allegedly originating from her partner's infidelity. The album overall avoids myopic individualism in its themes and instead treats them abstractly enough to allow anyone to identify or interpret the lyrics to their own circumstances. \"Vulnicura\" is not memoir.\n\nFar from self-indulgent melodrama, \"Vulnicura\" contains some of Bjork's most stunningly beautiful and moving work. \"Stonemilker,\" an absolutely gorgeous opener saturated with strings, openly and nakedly begs for emotional expression and respect as the strings soar with painful longing. The title's intriguing meaning gets revealed in the line \"What is it that I have, that makes me feel your pain? Like milking a stone, to get you to say it.\" Many people will probably identify with the analogy of \"milking a stone\" when confronted with the emotional betrayal of a loved one. Not only does it appear quite futile, any real effort at drawing milk from a stone would probably result in considerable pain. If only stones could lactate. Oh well. \"Lionsong\" seems to muse on the reaction of the betrayer to the situation at hand while also dismissing any real concern: \"Maybe he will come out of this, maybe he won't, somehow I'm not too bothered either way.\" With equally juicy strings, a similar brooding mood to the previous song also pervades this second track. Such situations present a frustratingly complicated multidimensional matrix, which this song seems to examine. Will he come out? Maybe, maybe not, who cares? Well, I'm curious, but I really don't care. Also, the line \"it's a sign of maturity to be stuck in complexity\" seems to excoriate simple black and white emotional interpretations. These situations cause real anguish, confusion and perplexity that defy words. Music can sometimes get the feelings across, and \"Lionsong\" largely succeeds in communicating the inevitable miasma. The considerably more electronic \"History of Touches\" delves into a remembered intimate moment that in retrospect felt tinged with a lurking finality. But all such moments seem simultaneously omnipresent. A sensuous oneness floats above the staggering and indistinct background keyboards. \"Black Lake\" returns directly to \"Stonemilker's\" themes and mood. A sprawling ten-minute exploration of what went wrong, it occasionally explodes into storms of electronic percussion. It also includes some intriguing passages: \"You fear my limitless emotions, I am bored of your apocalyptic obsessions.\" The accusations also come out in full force: \"I did it for love, I honored my feelings, you betrayed your own heart, corrupted that organ\" and \"family was always our sacred mutual mission, which you abandoned.\" Some fairly intense interludes punctuate the verses. A bittersweet string melody closes the piece. \"Family\" uses digital thumps and scrapes and an eerie ambience as a foundation for mourning the death of a family, potentially the already mentioned abandoned family in \"Black Lake.\" A sonically surprising bridge then suddenly interrupts the murky dirge with bouncy staccato strings. This song may represent the acceptance stage of grief. Basically, it's over, bring on the funky strings.\n\n\"Notget\" reaches a cathartic peak. Full of open throated lamentations such as \"love will keep us safe from death\" and \"I will not forget this notget, will you not regret having love let go.\" The song succeeds phenomenally in portraying ominous emotions. It ranks as one of the album's most unforgettable moments. \"Atom Dance\" exudes the cosmic and molecular mood of \"Biophilia\" with plucking strings and lines such as \"I am fine tuning my soul to the universal wavelength, no one is a lover alone, I propose an atom dance.\" Once again, the song quickly transforms with the voice of ANOHNI, who also dueted with Bjork on \"Volta.\" Healing appears: \"we aim at peeling off dead layers of loveless love\" and \"when you feel the flow as primal love, enter the pain and dance with me!\" Then finally some signs of release appear: \"atoms are laughing at last.\" \"Mouth Mantra\" hints at some kind of inexplicable verbal constipation. \"My throat was stuffed, my mouth sewn up, banned from making noise, I was not heard.\" \"Quicksand\" departs somewhat from the album's underlying mood with percussion and digital giant wasp buzzes. The lyrics discuss \"our mother's philosophy\" which \"feels like quicksand.\" Other interesting lines suggest energy sources to carry on: \"locate her black lake, the steam from this pit, will form a cloud, for her to live on.\" This may provide an alternate to the less elegant line \"when life gives you poop, put it on your garden.\"\n\n\"Vulnicura\" presents yet another dimension of Bjork's continuing artistry. Yes, it feels safe to apply that dangerous and now almost quaint word to her work. She sits directly in the tradition of \"music as art,\" arguably traceable to the Beatles, that tries to push boundaries, to not simply repeat past successes, to explore and unearth new ideas, sounds and emotions. This album contains no instantly radio-friendly or easily accessible pop hooks. And that's a good thing. The airwaves have far too much of that already. The curious human brain needs to stray away from safe cultural havens at least once in a while, and Bjork's ever evolving music continues to provide such an oasis. She hasn't stopped either. Apparently fully past the pain of the breakup that inspired \"Vulnicura,\" 2017 will apparently see another new Bjork album titled \"Utopia.\" The first single, \"The Gate,\" certainly points to another indescribable and endlessly fascinating collection of songs, not to mention more stunning surreal imagery. Slowing down certainly doesn't seem like an option for Bjork at this point. \"Vulnicura\" will probably end up as one more step on what hopefully remains a long journey.","classification":5,"fold":7}

The instrumentals, pauses, soft and high notes are perfect and timed well. Many songs are repetitive but you don't sense that from this song. The lyrics and chorus may be similar, but the tone and his voice definitely transforms throughout the song, building with tension, emotion, and heartfelt love.\n\n- Fun to sing out aloud.

If anyone but Cher had done this album it would go down as the greatest of all time.  Unfortunetly, because people want Cher to die for some reason, they ignore her.  It's sad that someone who the great Madonna models herself after can be ignored.  Living Proof is the greatest album of Cher's career...which is tough to say about a diva with albums such as \"Believe\", \"It's a Mans World\", \"Cher\", \"Heart of Stone\", \"Take Me Home\", and \"Half Breed\".

{"text":"This is Weezer's first ever album, and I think it's pretty good. I think Raditude might be my first favorite. I think this is a good album for anybody who needs a nice rockin' tune to listen to, but it's not quite hard-rock enough to be like Nirvana or Smashing Pumpkins. The music is also very creative and original, much different from all the grunge that was released back in 1994. Best of all, it's timeless! Each song has at least something to say about it.\n\n\"My Name is Jonas\" might be a song about the singer's brother, since the actual singer's name is Rivers. A punk rock song with a light guitar intro. The only bad thing is that the rhythm is kind of hard to find at first.\n\nThe Amazon sample for \"No One Else\" says \"My girl's got eyeballs,\" but the whole line is \"My girl's got eyeballs in the back of her head.\" The music is fun, catchy, and a little simple.\n\n\"The World Has Turned And Left Me Here\" is so Weezer-y, you can almost immediately tell who sang it if you hear it for the first time on the radio. I would've given it a 5\/5, but it kind of got old after a while.\n\n\"Buddy Holly\" is Awesome! Does Rivers really look like Buddy Holly? Kinda, kinda not.\n\nNext comes \"Undone\", which isn't the kind of song that's meant to be played on the radio. It starts of as a pretty decent Weezer song, but it's a bit long. Rivers starts singing at 0:52 [after a conversation sound-clip with two people] and stops singing at around 3:20, then the music gets annoyingly intense at 3:52. Once it dies down, we just start hearing some microphone feedback and some ominous piano chords. I think it'd be much better off without them.\n\n\"Surf Wax America\" is a nice song that makes you want to go surfing [or take your board to work, as Rivers says]. But like the previous song, it has something that I wish it didn't have--the middle section. I know they're trying to sound cool and slowed down, but why is it so quiet?! I heard Holiday before this one, so I thought Holiday was the only song to have a middle section like that, which would make it seem more original. [Before I bought this album I had the songs Buddy Holly, Undone, Say It Ain't So, and Holiday] Other than that, I guess it's cool song.\n\nNext comes \"Say It Ain't So\". This one has everything that a Weezer fan would like; Pretty good lyrics, rockin' chorus, guitar solo, and it's really catchy. Say it IS so!\n\nSomebody said that \"In The Garage\" this one is an anthem for nerds\/ rock 'n' roll lovers, and I might have to agree. It's my favorite song on the album. I like the intro because it sounds so different from the rest of the song. [Is that a bagpipe?]\n\n\"Holiday\" is a bluesy song about setting off for adventure. Yes, it has a middle section, but much louder and better than the one SWA had.\n\n\"Only in Dreams\" is the finishing song, and it sounds EXACTLY like Undone at first, but it later starts to sound like a big mix of every other song on the album, so it makes a great last song [8 minutes]. But it had a lot of mic feedback at the end and Rivers stopped singing early again, so I'm not so sure about it. It got quiet like Surf Wax America and Holiday, but that's not exactly a middle section, since no one was singing, and because it happened towards the end. Long story short, it's a good last song, though it kind of sounds like Undone. [5\/10]\n\nNow for the bonus tracks:\n\nFor \"Mykel and Carley\", I'm not so sure who Mykel and Carley are, but the song was great! It had a guitar intro that reminded me of the intro for My Name is Jonas. Unusually it was also a bonus track for the band's newest album, Death to False Metal.\n\n\"Jamie\" is Just boring. Enough said.\n\nHowever, \"Susanne\" is Another great hit from Weezer!]\n\nFinally, we have \"PaperFace\". I have no idea what that means, but the actual song was just annoying. Rivers starts off singing quietly, until the tension in his voice builds up and enters the chorus. The chorus really annoyed me because Rivers is screaming his lungs out while the rest of the band is banging as hard as they can on their instruments. Once AGAIN, there's another middle section. Just don't really like it.","classification":4,"fold":7}

Her work on songs like Sledgehammer and This Is What You Came For, continue to show that her own album success firmly is not what it used to be a decade, largely because she overexposed her own brand in the way that Beyonce' Knowles had done as well. The past few years showed Rihanna doing more singles that really were not a part of what became Anti, and bigger hits than what she released from Anti, with the exception of Work. Her latest single, Love On The Brain, the fourth from Anti, shows Rihanna is trying to be more of a swooner in the way other legendary divas had shown in classic R&B like the legendary Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin showcased. But Rihanna does not make the mark well, and sadly it is not the best on what she had n ballads for her songs. She showed it better when she teamed up with Ne-Yo on Hate That I Love You a decade ago. Perhaps when Rihanna does more ballads, she can swoon with a broader and more brilliant appeal than what she showed here.\n\nSong: C-","classification":3,"fold":7}

Fortunately, those places are few and far between on this particular set. I wish Vanguard could do something about this, though.\n\nThe Brandenburg Concerti with Josef Suk and his chamber orchestra are very enjoyable. However, the recording of the First Concerto begins here with the first movement of the 5th Concerto. The actual first movement of the first Concerto is missing. Another glaring mistake by our friends at Vanguard.\n\nStill, highly recommended.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Finally Lester, Kalel, Noah and Rob together again making an album after the last one they released together was For The Love of The Game. I love One Love Revolution, it sorta has a mixture of WDWGFH, Fireproof, and The Reckoning if you were to the sound of those albums and throw them together.

{"text":"If the gang on \"Scooby-Doo\" met Karen O and decided to form a punk band, it would probably sound a lot like Be Your Own Pet. Part Saturday morning cartoon, part suburban punk, Be Your Own Pet pack relentlessly raucous rhythms and frenzied attitude into twelve songs that rush by like a Japanese Bullet Train. It takes less than thirty minutes to play all of `Get Awkward,' but that's enough to leave a permanent mark.\n Most of the bandmembers have reached their golden (post-teen) years since their debut album was released two tears ago, but thankfully, they haven't quite yet settled into maturity. There's still plenty of songs about feeling awkward (see the title?) such as \"The Beast Within,\" and goofy youth fantasy tunes like \"Zombie Graveyard Party,\" but most of the album revolves around experiences that have befallen them since their rise to recognition (or are they already `famous'?), combining lots of attitude with a generous dose of humor. \"Bitches Leave\" is a funny and poignant rant about girls who bring their attitude backstage. \"You're a Waste\" summarizes a blown relationship with an idiot ex, with these lines; \"Go ahead and tell your sob story, all I have to say about it is `Blow Me'. As sung by female vocalist Jemina Pearl, the line cuts to the bone while it makes you laugh.\n Perhaps the best thing about Be Your Own Pet is their ability to communicate beyond their own peer group. Anybody who listened to early Blondie or the Buzzcocks will appreciate the intelligent songcraft of this band's songwriting. If you have to grow up, you may as well enjoy it, but on \"Get Awkward,\" Be Your Own Pet make it clear that they are too busy enjoying themselves to be bothered. Since they can make music as infectious as this, why should they?  B+ Tom Ryan","classification":4,"fold":7}

The song brought in more of a retro R&B \/ Soul rhythm that honestly was a laid back style that was overshadowed as a Top 10 song in the Billboard R&B charts, without a video for the song from his 2001 record, Invincible. It wasn't a bad song to hear from the album, but honestly not as a strong song as was 80's songs from Thriller and Bad.

{"text":"Paolo Nutini makes a huge splash with his debut album, These Streets. Paolo displays a natural talent for singing and songwriting; and his voice is rich and full of masculine warmth. Just one listen to this CD proves it!\n\nThe track set begins with \"Jenny Don't Be Hasty.\" Paolo sings with the style of a seasoned pro; this number about a woman he wants makes a strong start for this album! The electric guitar, drums and percussion make a good musical arrangement. \"Last Request,\" another highlight of this fantastic album; lets Paolo sing with great sensitivity of how he wants one last time alone with a woman who doesn't love him anymore. The melody charms me with its beauty; and I predict that you will enjoy \"Last Request\" very, very much.\n\n\"These Streets,\" the title track of this album, begins with some pretty awesome guitar; and when Paolo comes in this number takes off like a jet! Paolo laments losing his childhood because in retrospect he realizes things were simpler for him back then. The guitar works wonders for this number; and the guitar alone with Paolo's voice makes \"These Streets\" a true masterpiece!\n\n\"White Lies\" has another beautiful arrangement for the guitar; and \"Loving You\" lets Paolo sing happily of finding his one true love. Paolo also shows off his wide vocal range, sometimes singing a few words in falsetto--flawless!\n\nThe album ends with \"Alloway Grove.\" This number starts with the drums and guitar; and when Paolo comes in he sings this perfectly! Paolo sings of his disappointment that the girl he loves is no longer there for him. The upbeat melody belies the sadness of the lyrics; but it all works well for Paolo and his musicians. The lengthy number works well.\n\nThe liner notes include the lyrics to all the songs except for some of the lyrics to \"Alloway Grove;\" and the artwork impresses me. We get some good shots of Paolo, too.\n\nPaolo Nutini's first album sounds like a tour de force of a very seasoned talent--which is truly phenomenal since he's still rather young and this is only his first CD. I highly recommend this CD for fans of comparatively mellow rock and pop vocals.\n\nGreat job, Paolo!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I recently downloaded the full album and, must say, it is one of the best  Jimmy Cliff has  put out in years. Rebirth is Jimmy Cliff's return to form, performing the best reggae, rock steady and ska you come to expect from a legend like him. With Tim Armstrong (from the punk band Rancid) as a producer, Jimmy Cliff has all the necessary  ingredients to succeed with this album. Highlights on this album include the opening track World Upside Down, One More, Children's Bread, the catchy Reggae Music (which reminds me of one his classic hits of the mid 1980's Reggae Night) and a couple of covers: The Guns of Brixton (The Clash) and Ruby Soho (Rancid). Although I must admit that I haven`t listened to this album as fully as it should be, it has all the potential to be one of the best reggae albums of all time. So, if you are a reggae fan or a serious music fan like me, grab a copy of this CD and enjoy.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Although I'm a first-generation Beatlemaniac, I have always loved these collections because they present an excellent overview of the Fab Four's career, from Love Me Do to The Long and Winding Road.  While not all of my favorite Beatle songs are represented herein, the Fabs had so many great songs that it would be impossible to produce a definitive collection that would please everyone.  This set may have been a forerunner to all of those \"The Essential...\" collections that we see today.\n\nI purchased the combined Red\/Blue set from Amazon.ca for a slightly higher price (around $42); that set is a QVC exclusive in the States right now, but it may be available on other sites, including Amazon.com, later on.\n\nPackaging of the two sets is much better than the 1993 CD issues; foldout digipaks replace the clamshell jewel boxes.  The booklets are really nice with a great essay by Bill Flanagan and lots of photos.  The version that I purchased combines the two sets in a nice slipcase.\n\nThe sound quality, using the 2009 remasters, is much better than it was in 1993, when the inferior 1987\/88 masters were used.  My only disappointment is that the mono masters of Please Please Me and From Me to You were used, as was the case in 1993, instead of the stereo mixes that were issued on the original 1973 LPs.  Perhaps Apple wanted to release these versions to the general public, as they were previously available (the remastered versions) only on the pricey THE BEATLES IN MONO box set.\n\nI'm surprised that Apple didn't upgrade BEATLES 1 for its 10th anniversary issue; perhaps they will.  These sets have all 27 tracks from 1, plus 27 more.\n\nFor new Beatle fans, these albums are a perfect introduction to the group, and will leave them wanting more.  For the casual fan who just wants the big hits, this set is perfect.  But even for the rabid fan and collector, this set is a must-have.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Although she's long been known as the Queen Of Hip Hop Soul, Mary J. Blige hasn't been afraid to step out of her comfort zone. After the release of 1994's \"My Life\", she went on a musical journey that showed her maturing and evolving. Her first album without the auspices of mentor Sean \"Puffy\" Combs - 1997's \"Share My World\" saw Blige break through with newcomer Rodney Jerkins while working with R&B legends Jimmy Jam  & Terry Lewis, George Benson and James Mtume. 1999's \"Mary\" was largely devoid of any hip hop influences, but ironically became one of her best albums. 2001 saw the release of the aptly titled \"No More Drama\", where Blige wanted to leave behind the music of her past and transition to a happier vibe - much to the chagrin of her fans. She reunited with Combs on the noticeably upbeat \"Love & Life\", while adopting a more mature outlook for 2005's \"The Breakthrough\" and 2007's \"Growing Pains\". After two more recordings for Interscope, Blige decided she wanted a change of labels - as well as a change of scenery. Those changes brought about her 2014 album \"The London Sessions\".\n\nHer first album for historic label Capitol Records, Blige decided to collaborate with mostly British producers, songwriters and singers - most of whom were big fans of hers. The only American musician involved in the project is Blige's longtime collaborator Rodney Jerkins. On the album, she works with British producers such as Disclosure, Sam Romans, Fraser T. Smith, Jimmy Napes and Steve Fitzmaurice. Blige also gets songwriting help from UK singers - and Capitol labelmates - Sam Smith and Emeli Sande. Blige starts off the recording with the track \"Therapy\", where she tries to deal with her difficult emotions. On the track \"Doubt\", Blige tries to remain positive in the face of negative criticism and tries to help a significant other's self esteem on \"Not Loving You\". She expresses her feelings on the lovelorn ballad \"When You're Gone\", which leads into the first single, the trip hop influenced first single \"Right Now\". She sings of dealing with relationship up and downs on \"Long Hard Look\", while exploring the topic of heartbreak and domestic violence on the single \"Whole Damn Year\". She collaborates with Disclosure again on the track \"Follow\" and ends the album with \"Worth My Time\". \"The London Sessions\" is a good recording from Mary J. Blige. Although it's deeply rooted in the the subject of heartbreak, she makes an effort to expand her sound beyond her usual hip hop soul fare. To that end, she's made a listenable effort without alienating her fanbase.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"The 1990s was a turbulent time for music. I just found it difficult to adjust to the change from the awesome music from the 80's to the music of the 90's. The introduction of grunge, rap, and other music was hard to get use to. In 1992 along come a great song from Alannah Myles, BLACK VELVET. I thought the music of the 1990's is not lost we have a winner. The reason why I love this song is the lyrics beat, and it has something for everybody. It is a song that is a blend of Pop\/Country, the beat is a blend and the lyrics to me is more pop. So if U hate Pop music you will still love this song and vice-versa with those who dis-like Country music like me. I guarantee you will get attached to this song regardless with music you prefer, so enjoy.\n\nTHX,\nKris L. CocKayne","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I continue to be utterly amazed by Brandi Carlile. I know it sounds clich, but she just gets better and better. In my opinion, this is her best, most mature work yet. I thought \"Bear Creek,\" her most recent album before this was a stunner. I actually thought it just can't get better than this. Well, I am happy to say that I was wrong. There are no obscure or \"filler\" tracks on this album. Each is a gem in its own right and each is uniquely Brandi Carlile. I admit to favoring the title track at the moment, but as this album rotates through my most recent playlist, others are beginning to grab their own special place.\nSpeaking of special places, I believe that Ms Carlile writes from her own special place. She is a keen observer of our culture, yet manages to put her wisdom into language that sounds like she is a much older observer than she is. She is, as they say, \"an old soul.\"\nI give this my highest recommendation. It is a thrill to be able to watch and hear this great artist become even greater.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Kelly Clarkson's second single from her fabulous new CD (\"All I Ever Wanted\") is the uber-catchy \"I Do Not Hook Up.\"  Katy Perry co-wrote the song along with Kara DioGuardi (the new judge on \"American Idol\") and producer Greg Wells, and she recorded it for her abandoned first solo CD (her version is available several places online for comparison).  Fortunately, Katy's reject is Kelly's gain as \"I Do Not Hook Up\" sounds like a surefire hit.\n\nIn the song, Kelly is being pursued by a guy, but she wants to make it clear that she's not in for a one night stand - Oh, no I do not hook up\/ up...I fall deep\/ `Cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight to say.  Like her previous single, the smash \"My Life Would Suck without You,\" this song is rock-based pop with plenty of guitars backing up Kelly's driving vocals.  \"I Do Not Hook Up\" is going to sound amazing on the radio.  After her last CD (\"December\") failed to deliver more than one Top 10 hit, I think Kelly is back on track as the biggest hit-maker from \"American Idol.\"","classification":5,"fold":7}

This also is her first single since the domestic violence spat with the controversial Chris Brown back in February.

{"text":"Contrary to another review here, this isn't the Soft Machine nor is it live. This album consists of semi-professional recordings of Giles, Giles & Fripp when they added multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald, lyricist Peter Sinfeidl and vocalist Judy Dyble (original vocalist for Fairport Convention). We get an early folkier sounding version of Crimson's \"I Talk to the Wind\" as well as one with Dyble on lead vocals. \"Under the Sky\" which would be a center piece later on Peter Sinfield's solo album written with Ian McDonald.\n\nThis album shows Giles, Giles & Fripp changing into Crimson all they are missing is Greg Lake. Featuring jazzy chord changes, Michael Giles characteristic drumming, Peter Niles exceptional bass playing and Ian McDonald on piano and flute (as well as occasional vocals) throughout, this is a worthwhile addition to fans of early King Crimson and even of Giles, Giles & Fripp. This album marks the transition from of GGF from into Crimson.\n\nSound quality is remarkably good given that these are demos (albeit professional demos)and the tapes are well over 30 years old. Dyble might have been an interesting choice as vocalist after Lake had left Crimson--a pity that Fripp didn't revisit her as a possible vocalist\/replacement. It certainly would have taken the band's sound in an interesting, distinct and different direction. There are alternate takes of various songs here included as well.","classification":4,"fold":7}

And then you have \"Pernicious\", which is both heavy and dramatic at the same time, an unbeatable combination. This album has definitely earned all four of its stars!","classification":4,"fold":7}
{"text":"I'll be upfront about this: while I like when Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds cut loose and fills some poor sap with lead (MURDER BALLADS remains one of my all-time favorite albums, of any artist from any genre), I'm more partial to their melancholy work.  THE BOATMAN'S CALL is simply a beautiful album; same with NOCTURAMA, even if the songs on it don't stand up with his best.\n\nPUSH THE SKY AWAY is comparable to both of these latter albums.  Ironically, the album's best and worst moments come in the same tune: \"Higgs Boson Blues.\"  One moment, Cave croons, \"Robert Johnson and the devil, man\/Don't know who's gonna rip off who.\"  The next, he's referencing Hannah Montana (twice!).  This idiosyncrasy is what irks me the most about SKY: at times, it feels like Cave didn't quite know what he wanted to write, and so just put something down, throwing it off as an artistic non sequitur.\n\nThose moments abound here.  They don't last long--not one song here is completely unlistenable; and face it, Cave has given us some of those during his career--and they're mostly overshadowed by the artistry we hear elsewhere.  Cave's poetry is in fine form; he manages to be brooding, threatening, subtle, outlandish, and romantic all at once: \"She was a catch\/We were a match\/I was the match that would fire up her s*****.\"  The album culminates in the beautiful title track.  When Cave sings \"Some people say it's just rock and roll\/Ah, but it gets you right down to your soul,\" he's not just reiterating something we've heard other, lesser artists say; he's speaking a universal truth.  Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds aren't for everyone, and their albums tend to be about as diverse as you can get.  But PUSH AWAY THE SKY is up there among Cave's better recent efforts.

If you're looking 4 more WHINING vocals from the lead singer you can forget it. He has finally reached P*berty and no longer sounds like Eminem. The lyrics to me just seem so much more mature and the group has collaborated so well with each other to create such an amazing piece of ART. I've noticed the roaster contains some big name producers and that is probably what everyone is experiencing on the shift in sound. But it's a very small semi change. The change actually seems like it's for the better. \"I Can Wait Forever\" has got to be one of my favorite songs on this album. It's a stand out track and is also an amazing ROCK BALLAD. Almost every song on this album is a 5 star track and the leads singer's voice really sounds so soothing and beautiful this time around. The hooks to the CHORUS lines are beyond ADDICTIVE. Great to see this band mature and I'm looking forward to see where this group lands next. Don't pass on this album because it's a total GEM.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"If you ignore the lyrics, this is a great song. Monster hook, great vocal performance and a girl who can shred the axe (apologies for the mixed guitar metaphor). But heaven help any girls who take this song's dreadful message to heart.\n\nIn one of the most awkward love triangles since Twilight, meet the key players:\n\nYOU are the guy Orianthi is hung up on. You are a Grade A hole.\n\nI is for Orianthi, the gifted singer and guitar goddess who is most popular for standing next to famous people (Michael Jackson, Carrie Underwood, Alice Cooper).\n\nHIM is the guy who sees I for everything she is worth.\n\nAccording to YOU, I'm stupid, worthless, can't do anything right, a mess in a dress, boring, moody, can't get anywhere on time (since this last point isn't subjective and can be proved or disproved by fact, I, as in me not her, bet he, as in YOU, has her, Orianthi, pegged).\n\nAccording to HIM, I'm beautiful, incredible, funny, irresistible - so naturally WE (me and you, the reader of this essay, and YOU, the jerk she is hung up on since she just told him a verse ago) can deduct that I has no interest in dating HIM.\n\nNever once in this song do we hear what I thinks about herself. Never once does she utter the words, \"According to ME, I'm fabulous, smart, intelligent, well-read, talented...\"\n\nSo the message is - Girls, your self-worth is totally defined by what men think about you. Good or bad.\n\nNice message. Wait, it gets worse.\n\nFine, I doesn't like HIM; he's probably a bit too clingy anyway. So what does she do? Hold her head high enough to find someone worthwhile of her companionship? No. Define herself on her own by not needing someone to complete her? No chance. I uses HIS opinion of her to beg YOU to come back.\n\nKid you not, she says, \"Why can't YOU see me through HIS eyes? Why are you making me decide?\" Um, decide WHAT? Stay in an abusive relationship with YOU, the guy who I just told us that he just told you that \"he can't take you anyplace?\" YOU have moved on. I should too.\n\nTo be fair, I didn't write this song, THEY (Steve Diamond and Andrew Frampton) did. Perhaps it would be best for Orianthi to speak for herself from now on.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"After years of grinding on the mixtape circuit, Meek finally releases his debut album. Back in 2005 he actually had a little buzz out here in South Jersey, not to mention Philly isn't far from New Jersey anyway. Alot of people in my high school was listening to him, he even did a few songs with a local artist out here years ago. I always thought he could rap, but I hated his style of rapping, my boys had a few his of mixtapes (The Real Me Pt. 1 & 2). I enjoy some of his music alot more now than I did in the past. Power 99fm, a popular radio station in my area played some of his joints in regular rotation like \"Rose Red\" and \"In My Bag\". I listened to the come Up Show by Cosmic Kev on Friday nights and he always played the latest Meek joints, as well as other Philly artist so I'm familiar with the Philly rap scene.\n\nNow on to the album, the album starts off with a great intro track produced by Tone the Beat Bully, where he spits \"I used to pray for times like this\/ to rhyme like this \/So I had to grind like that to shine like this\" and \"See my dreams unfold\/ nightmares come true\/ It was time to marry the game and I said Yeah I do\", then on \"In God We Trust\" he talks about things people do for money, especially people who snitch to get rich. Meek hits the clubs for \"Young & Gettin' It\" featuring Kirko Bangz, its a catchy song but it would of been way better without the autotune. Things get real on the intense Boi-1da produced \"Traumatized\", where Meek reminisces about friends e lost and threatens to kill the dude who murdered his father with lines like \"When I find the n**** that killed my daddy know I'mma ride Hope you hear me, I'mma kill you n**** To let you know that I don't feel you n****\/ Yeah, you ripped my family apart and made my momma cry\/ So when I see you n**** it's gon' be a homicide\/ Cuz I was only a toddler you left me traumatized\". Other gems include \"Maybach Curtains\" featuring Nas, John Legend and Rick Ross, \"Tony Story Pt. 2, \"Polo & Shelltops\" and \"Who you Around\" featuring Mary J.Blige.\n\nWith all that being said, there is some less than average joints like \"Believe It\", which is typical a Rick Ross type song with a trap beat and repetitive hook that we heard from him a thousand times already \"I gotta a bad b**** in my Chevy \/Sellin Miley Cyrus in my brand new Monte Carlo\/ I got that Justin Bieber please believe it!\", just in case nobody understood those lines, hes making drug references. \"Rich & Famous\" featuring Louie V is a automatic skip, this song is talking about buying a girls love wth a atrocious hook \"I wanna buy your love, tell me what it's gon' be? \/I wanna buy your love, everything is on me\/ Lifestyle of the rich and the famous\/ Don't you wanna be rich and be famous?\", \"Lay Up\" featuring Wale, Rick Ross and Trey Songz could be a hit, but it looks better on paper.\n\nOverall Meek drops a solid debut, but his limited subject matter holds him back from reaching his full potential. Meek spends too much time addressing haters, and bragging about what hes got to the point it can turn listeners away. He also lacks consistency, unlike his Philly peers (Beanie Sigel, Young Gunz, Eve, and Freeway) whos debut albums were street and had replay value as well, and they didn't sound repetitive.  At the end of the day Meek is rapping what his life is about, things he seen, he really is from streets and he holds the streets down. When he raps, his aggressiveness makes you believe what hes saying. Its good to see him bring Philly hip hop back to the mainstream. One more issue I had was that it seems like he used his best tracks for his Dreamchasers mixtapes, songs like \"House Party\", \"Lean wit It\" and \"Dreamchasers Featuring Beanie Sigel\" could of easily replaced some of the filler on here and made it a 4 star album. On his next solo album I would like to see him grow more as an artist.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Jason Derulo may forever be trying to recreate his number one smash 'Watcha Say'. Why wouldn't he? After all, the Imogen Heap sample was quite brilliant, with his vocals more built around it rather than the other way around.\n\n'Don't Wanna Go Home' samples two different songs, leading to a bit of a desperation to earn a hook. However, it works here, due to the more obscure nature of the two tracks in question, and the fact that they are integrated a bit more subtly than on 'Watcha Say'. The lyrics don't lend anything new to the pop music scene, in full-out party mode since what seems like the dawn of time these days (or before Tik Tok became the seventh most downloaded song ever). With that being said, there's nothing wrong with this single; it will easily propel Derulo into the Top Twenty once again, as it seems to have already done.\n\nThe bottom line is that Jason Derulo's new single is a good, faceless piece of pop worth dancing to. It's not the song that's going to earn him any credibility or establish his image, but it is going to keep people from leaving the party early, and that's all he really wants to do anyway.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"As we all know, the hard rock\/heavy metal world recently lost a true legend and icon in Motorhead frontman Lemmy Kilmister as he passed away on December 28th after a short battle with an extremely aggressive form of cancer just four days after celebrating his 70th birthday, but at least he didn't go down without a single fight, as Lemmy and the rest of the Motorhead crew were able to crank out one last knockout punch of pure Motorhead magic with their 22nd full length album \"Bad Magic\" which was released back in August, just five months before Lemmy's unexpected passing. I've been a huge fan of Motorhead's music since I was 19 when I first got into both \"Ace of Spades\" and \"No Sleep 'til Hammersmith\" back in 2002, and even though I never got a chance to see Motorhead live in concert, but their music really left a lasting impression on me, and they quickly became one of my favorite bands of all time.\n\nAnyways, \"Bad Magic\" is just 100% pure essential Motorhead, and in other words, it just plain kicks ass. This album like any other Motorhead album is a blast of pure attitude and sonic power throughout. When you hear that opening grab-you-right-by-the-throat scream from Lemmy of \"VICTORY OR DIE\" in the album's opening track \"Victory or Die\", there's certainly no question that this album will definitely have you hooked within an instant. Every song on this album is definitely a real winner. The production is just top notch throughout, and of course the band's musicianship doesn't disappoint whatsoever. Guitarist Phil Campbell is in fine form throughout this album as he displays his masterful guitar skills with awesome, mean sounding riffs and furious, ripping solos through one track to the next, meanwhile drummer Mikkey Dee sounds absolutely amazing as he flawlessly pummels his way relentlessly throughout with his awesome drumming through each track with ease, and of course Lemmy himself delivers with his always heavy, powerful, snarling vocals and awesome, heavy-as-a-bulldozer bass playing. There's certainly no question that Lemmy was the true driving force behind Motorhead and they'll definitely never be another one like him.\n\nThe album's opening track \"Victory or Die\" immediately gets the ball rolling in blistering fashion with Lemmy's opening scream of \"VICTORY OR DIE\" and is quickly followed by a lethal abundance of heavy, blistering riffage, and loud, thundering drum beats throughout, meanwhile the following cut \"Thunder & Lightning\" (My favorite track on here) steps the album up a notch with a more faster tempo, heart pounding drums, and intense, furious riffing, plus a very memorable ripping and wailing guitar solo from Phil around the 1:35 mark is also featured, plus awesome vocals from Lemmy as well. Afterwards, we have track three \"Fire Storm Hotel\" which is a super catchy, groovy number that features a very catchy and groovy ZZ Top-like groove throughout with awesome riffs and catchy vocal melodies, while track four \"Shoot Out All of Your Lights\" brings back the intensity with a blistering drum intro, and is further highlighted by more furious, thundering double bass drumming from Mikkey, and mean blistering riffs plus a wicked, wailing, and screaming solo from Phil, as well as more amazing vocal delivery from Lemmy too. Next up, track five \"The Devil\" is another killer song that packs a nice punch throughout boasting heavy crunchy guitars and bass, and it also features an awesomely, wicked, blazing guest guitar solo courtesy of Queen guitarist Brian May, and moving on, the sixth track \"Electricity\" (another one of my favorites) is a short yet very fun and super catchy rock n' roll number that features awesome riffing, catchy vocals and lyrics, and a very catchy upbeat rhythm that you just can't resist headbanging and dancing to, and elsewhere, track seven \"Evil Eye\" is yet another favorite on here that boasts a fast, bouncy, pumping rhythm, along with more heart pumping riffage and awesome, memorable vocal deliveries.\n\nMoving forward, the eighth track \"Teach Them How to Bleed\" is another brilliant standout track that begins with a cool bass intro, and then thunders in with a relentless, fast-paced, onslaught with relentless, streamrolling riffs and heavy, thumping drums beats, and is also further accompanied by an excellent guitar solo from Phil, along with more of Lemmy's awesome vocals, and some intelligent lyrics to boot as well. Following that up is the sober, meaningful, and truly grand, slow-paced brilliantly written ballad \"Till the End\" and it is such an incredibly moving and meaningful song that definitely earns a place amongst Motorhead's classic songs. I really dig Lemmy's vocal melodies throughout, plus Phil's guitar solo from 2:26 to 3:29 is really top notch too. Track ten \"Tell Me Who to Kill\" is another top notch song that boasts another batch of awesome riffs, and super cool bass lines, plus another fantastic guitar solo from Phil, and excellent vocals from Lemmy to boot, meanwhile the following song \"Choking on Your Screams\" is a brilliantly delightful, and fearsome number that is very dark both lyrically and musically. This song is just filled with dark lyrics, and amazing musicianship throughout. I just love it. Then we have track twelve \"When the Sky Comes Looking For You\" which contains a very catchy and upbeat feeling throughout with delicious, rocking riffing and solid drum work, plus a fantastic chorus and another killer guitar solo are also featured in this song, and then finally, we have an immensely joyful, and satisfying cover of the Rolling Stones' \"Sympathy For the Devil\" which caps off this amazing album in perfect fashion.\n\nWell there you have it folks, all in all, \"Bad Magic\" is an all around amazing effort by Lemmy and Co., and a very nice and fitting end to an absolutely incredibly massive, and influential 40 year career, and yes even though Lemmy may be gone now, but there is certainly no question that his legacy and spirit will forever live on in our hearts. Buy this album now!!! 5 stars all the way!!!\n\nR.I.P. Lemmy!!! Farewell and God Speed!!!","classification":5,"fold":7}

May I suggest also these by Joe Baker for your listening enjoyment:\n\n1) Thunderstorm By the Sea--this sounds like a gentle thunderstorm while at sea so it is very soothing and relaxing to listen to and it is 73 minutes.\n\n2) Ultra Pure White Noise--this is the very calming white noise and very gentle, the soft and relaxing kind. And I must say the best quality of white noise that I have heard and it is 73 minutes.\n\n3) Wind and Rain - This is a soothing and gentle wind and rain. Easy to listen to and so so relaxing! IT is 73 minutes.\n\n4) Ocean Waves and Wind - This is 74 minutes of pure relaxation!\n\n5) Thundering Rainstorm - This is about 73 minutes.\n\n6) Babbling Brook - This is my very favorite one.

{"text":"Sadly, it almost has been 5 years since Michael Jackson passed away, and sadly almost all of the unreleased songs haven't been as strong as what made the King Of Pop such a perfectionist in the first place. He was a one of a kind, but sadly his death remains one of the most deviating heartbreaks of the world. Posthumously his songs have reached a generous world of new fans. Love Never Felt So Good, the lead single from the upcoming Xscape record tries and brings in a disco pop sound to what made Michael so special. But hearing a Barry White style into his voice doesn't actually ignite in the voice. It worked better with Hold My Hand with what he was planning with Akon and This Is It, but overall there are some artists that sound cheaper when they have passed on, and unfortunately Michael Jackson is one of them. He was great as a performer, but overall you should listen to his works when Michael was around for the world to see, not unreleased work after he passed on, because it has been very weak.\n\nSong: C","classification":3,"fold":7}

Naturally, I wanted to purchase Glow but it was not yet available for purchase, so I went with an intuitive feeling to get Ghost.  Ghost is also a song that draws a listener in because she is singing about someone who has left an impact on her and is singing about her though process of trying to figure out how to best deal with it. Henderson also carefully projects her voice during the song in a way that conveys she is really putting all of her spirit and emotion to the song.  Ghost by Ella is great for those who are open to listening to pop songs with hints of R&B and synth-pop.","classification":5,"fold":7}
{"text":"Rick Springfield just knows how to craft good songs and good albums, plain and simple. And so much of what he brings to the table is missing from today's music. Good songwriting, emotional lyrics, and power pop\/rock and roll like it was meant to be played. Springfield has taken a few breaks from recording over the years but aside from those gaps he has delivered consistent album after consistent album, with the themes and tones of his work varying slightly but staying true to what he has always done best.\n\n\"I Hate Myself\" makes for a great single, the emotional guitar-studded ballad \"You & Me\" recalls the Gin Blossoms at their finest. \"Gabriel\" is a beautifully written ballad as well. As far as the rockers go, he may have his best set of hooks in decades, with \"Wide Awake\" and \"Our Ship's Sinking\" hitting hard right off the bat. This is an artist who knows what he does best, does not try to stretch the formula too far, but works like a craftsman. He has this type of music down to a science, and he has never sounded more immediate and enthusiastic as he does now, nearly three and a half decades into his career.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I really had high hopes for Barbra Streisand's new PARTNERS CD especially after seeing her on the Tonight Show w\/Jimmy Fallon and hearing the first couple of songs on the CD.\n\nDon't get me wrong the CD is good, but there's nothing new to hear people.\n\nI LOVE her duet with Michael Buble \"It Had To Be You,\" which has that big band sound (and borders on a swinging beat but never goes full throttle) and I had hoped that the rest would be in a similar vain. Streisand is in PRIME voice for doing a full-on swinging\/jazzy up-tempo CD and why this has not happened is beyond me.\n\nTracks 2-5 are nice re-workings of her song book including a fabulous duet with Stevie Wonder and his harmonica on a Bossa nova tinged version of \"People,\" and the guitar riffs by John Mayer on \"Come Rain or Come Shine\" are fantastic -- even though those are her \"standards\" -- they sound fresh and revamped. Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds puts his own stamp on \"Evergreen,\" but it doesn't stray to far from the original, and the duet with Billy Joel on his song \"New York State Of Mind\" was a long time in coming but it works.\n\nUnfortunately tracks 6 and 7 don't work for me. \"I'd Want It To Be You,\" Streisand's duet with Blake Shelton -- though I like the song -- their voices don't blend very well together and seems out-of-place with the first five tracks. This song sounds more like something that belongs on a kid's movie or something. This song will probably grow on me, but still it just doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nLikewise, Barbra's duet with Lionel Richie on her classic \"The Way We Were\" misses the mark altogether and sounds too 'elevator-ish' losing all the intensity of the original. It almost sounds like they were trying to combine \"The Way We Were\" with \"Endless Love.\" Now if they did a medley of those two songs then this might have been stand out (maybe).\n\n\"I Still Can See Your Face\" is a nice duet with Andrea Bocelli, only because both are such talented singers, but the music is more of the same in that it's lush, quiet, and nocturnal.\n\nThe duet with her son Jason Gould \"How Deep Is The Ocean\" is nice and he can sing, but this was featured in a live performance on \"Back To Brooklyn,\" so nothing new.\n\nTracks 10 and 11, \"What Kind Of Fool\" with John Legend and \"Somewhere\" with Josh Groban, are great but only when they hark back to the original compositions. Sometimes you just can't top the original or original reworking of a song and that shows here.\n\nLastly, the duet with Elvis Presley, \"Love Me Tender\" is OK, but it's missing something and I don't know what? It lacks the intimacy(?) -immediacy(?) of other manufactured duets like Natalie Cole's duet with her father on \"Unforgettable\" or even Barbra's duet with an on-screen Marlon Brando \"I'll Know\" (maybe she just sung with his character on Guys and Dolls) and I think she did another one with Frank Sinatra \"I've Got A Crush On You,\" which was shown during her concerts, so it isn't like she hasn't done it successfully before. Maybe it's because the song itself isn't a good match? I'm not sure, but you'd think that this would be an instant classic-hit but I don't think so. It just sounds slapped together.\n\nAnyway, the CD comes with a booklet with pictures and liner notes by Barbra on each of her singing PARTNERS. Hopefully she'll do a follow up CD with up-tempo and swinging jazz\/torch songs, this time featuring other divas like Diana Ross, Patti Labelle, Lady GaGa, etc., because that would put her back at number 1!","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Miley Cyrus' train-wreck status, and atrocious other music, makes it hard embrace what, on its own merits, could be a solid song.  People may be critical of me not focusing only on the song but, in certain circumstances, you have to consider the bigger picture.  When Avril Lavigne released \"When You're Gone\", it was a relatively emotional, heartfelt song.  However, it came so soon after her bratty, and obnoxious, song \"Girlfriend\", that it negatively impacted how I felt towards the latter song.\n\n  Cyrus' run of horrid music (\"We Can't Stop\", \"Party in the USA\", and \"The Climb\"), and her ridiculous \"I'm trying to shock you to show you how grown up I am\" behavior, detracts from any positive vibe one could get from \"Wrecking Ball\".

Until that time, I cannot view this song positively.","classification":2,"fold":7}

{"text":"------------------------------------------------------\nRosanne Cash\n\"The Essential Rosanne Cash\"\n(Sony Legacy, 2011)\n------------------------------------------------------\nThis expansive 2-CD best-of could help save a lot of shelf space for CD-oriented fans, gathering material from throughout Cash's career.  It kicks off with \"Can I Still Believe In You,\" a lone track from her long-lost 1978 debut, an out-of-print rarity that was released in Europe, but never in the States.  Then come the Rodney Crowell years, where she and he helped sculpt a hip new country sound, melding artful, introspective lyrics with big, hook-heavy production -- just the right mix to take her to the top of the country charts throughout the early '80s.  There are a bunch of missing songs that I, personally, would have added here (especially \"Couldn't Do Nothin' Right\" and \"Take Me Take Me\") but with a collection like this, you can't have everything.  Disc One contains primarily her younger, Crowell-related material, including gems such as the smash hit, \"Seven Year Ache\" and \"My Baby Thinks He's A Train\"; Disc Two encompasses her later, more introspective albums, with standouts that include her tribute to her father, \"September When It Comes,\" and a smattering of songs from the List album.  There are, of course, several duets gathered here as well, including a nice one with Vince Gill and a fun version of Don Gibson's \"Sea Of Heartbreak,\" sung with Bruce Springsteen.  All in all, a great introduction to a thoughtful, potent, spiritually mature artist - definitely worth a spin! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Country Music)","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Anything written by David Foster and Jay Graydon is bound to be awesome. This song features production by Graydon and piano and synth by Foster. Graydon also does guitar work here and when you catch the guitar work towards the end of the song, it's incredible. The lyrics are pure poetry and, to date, I don't think anyone could have pulled this off like Al Jarreau. I'm sure this song could have been given to a screamer or belter, but the lyrics are too unique to be relegated to that platform. The keyboards are sparkling and this production has all the glisten that made other peer-songs a success: Lionel Richie's \"The only one\", Peter Cetera's \"The Glory of Love\", Paul Anka's \"Hold me till the morning comes\". If you were to look at the words of the chorus on paper, they would never come alive the way they do in this arrangement. Honestly, everyone involved in this project made it an adult contemporary success. If you're not an Al Jarreau fan (shame on you!), this song is also available on \"Slow Grooves\", a compilation of mid-80s R&B\/Soul that features Freddie Jackson, Jeffrey Osbourne, Teddy Pendergrass, Levert and more(may only be available on cassette). Don't let the critics fool you by calling this sound \"dated\". If you enjoy the love songs of the mid to late 80s, this is a timeless masterpiece to hang on the wall of your heart.","classification":5,"fold":7}
{"text":"It's no surprise that Henley would eventually make a straightforward country album at some point. Well, 15 years after his last solo album, this is it. \"Cass County\" is not what I wanted from Henley, but it's all right. There are some songs that have that old Henley bite lyrically, but mostly this is a watered down affair. I don't agree with all the four and five star reviews. Like the last Eagles album in 2007, \"Cass County\" is pleasant, but offers nothing new either lyrically or musically. It just exists in its own bubble. \"Cass County\" is no classic like \"Hotel California\", \"Building The Perfect Beast\" or \"The End Of The Innocence\". But, I'm fine with the fact that 68 year old Henley is happy with this product, it's just not what I was hoping for.\n\nWhat was I hoping for? Well, that cutting edge, both lyrically and musically. You know lyrically he has been prescient at times throughout his career, and musically he's always had someone helping him make music that eventually becomes classic rock, we haven't had that spirit here since 1989. Henley and Stan Lynch (of Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers) can't seem to hit the right stride on \"Cass County\", and instead they wrote songs that are just barely passable.\n\nI bought the standard cd version of this album, and then I downloaded the four extra tracks from the digital deluxe version. Of course, there's two more tracks on the super deluxe version that only Target sells, but how ridiculous can you get? I guess Henley doesn't really care about his product having so many different formats? Why couldn't we just get all 18 tracks either on one universal cd or as a digital download? At times, Henley is a hypocrite with his music deals with different corporations and what he actually gives his fans.\n\nAnyway, there are some tracks that stand out like \"The Cost Of Living\" with Merle Haggard, \"Take A Picture Of This\", \"Waiting Tables\", \"Praying For Rain\" and \"Where I Am Now\". And, is that a faint trace of synth I hear on \"That Old Flame\"? What's THAT doing on here? This is a pure country album, right, Don? There's also only three up-tempo tracks: \"No, Thank You\", \"That Old Flame\" and \"Where I Am Now\", the rest are all country ballads. This gives the album a slow and repetitive nature. The four extra tracks found on the digital deluxe edition don't do much to salvage the standard version of the album. At 68, I don't see Don Henley recapturing his glory days with one last classic effort, but stranger things have happened.\n\nHere's how \"Cass County\" compares to Henley's previous works:\n\nEagles:\n\nEagles (1972): Two and a Half Stars\nDesperado (1973): Three and a Half Stars\nOn The Border (1974): Three Stars\nOne Of These Nights (1975): Three and a Half Stars\nHotel California (1976): Five Stars\nThe Long Run (1979): Four Stars\nLong Road Out Of Eden (2007): Three and a Half Stars\n\nDon Henley:\n\nI Cant Stand Still (1982): Four Stars\nBuilding The Perfect Beast (1984): Five Stars\nThe End Of The Innocence (1989): Five Stars\nInside Job (2000): Three Stars\nCass County (2015): Three Stars","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"4.5 stars\n\nThe new album by the \"coolest musician in America\" (Sunday Times) starts off by flattering to deceive. \"Futile Devices\" the opening track to Sufjan Stevens new set of songs could have happily appeared on the outstanding \"Seven Swans\" and is a gentle bubbling track with a fragile folksy beauty which Stevens can appear to evoke with consummate ease. So then Stevens is clearly going to compensate for his abandonment of his 50 state album cycle promise with a return to earlier glories?\n\nNo such chance, indeed while the \"\"he Age of Adz\" has many transcendent moments, this is primarily an album of electronic soundscapes, whose trajectory can be loosely traced back in Stevens musical past to 2002's largely electronic Chinese Zodiac concept album \"Enjoy your Rabbit\". It is therefore not surprising that the critical reception to this album thus far has been in places bemused and quizzical (and in Uncut's case characterised by outright hostility questioning whether our hero is \"a genius or just a show off\").\n\nThe line between originality and over indulgence is of course a thin one but in Stevens case his ability to make his music soar is the special ingredient. For example the second track \"Too much\" is Sufjan Stevens meets Yeasayer and a joyous electronic concoction. The funky electronica of \"I walked\" revolves around a trip hop big synth loop, combined with Stevens trademark angelic vocals and surreal lyrics where he asks \"Lover, will you look from me now\/I'm already dead\/but I've come to explain\/why I left such a mess on the floor\". Other highlights also include the gently rolling 'Vesuvius' which concentrates on giving self advice and messages to himself plus \"Bad communication\" a short beautiful fragment of a song. The title track is alternatively; erm what's the word I'm looking for, yes thats it ....mental! A tribute of sorts to the weird abstract art of Louisiana based Royal Robertson it starts off with great Wagnerian voices then Stevens singing through cat calls and symphonic whistles over an eight minute hodgepodge powerhouse that has to heard to be believed not least the lovely acoustic end.\n\nAnd then we have the final track the 25 minute (I kid you not!) \"The Impossible Soul\" which is a mini album in its own right and a sort of Tubular Bells for the Twitter Generation which wanders far and wide. It starts conventionally and then leads into a strange exhortation where Stevens cheekily pleads with us \"Don't be distracted\", has a lovely vocoder section, at 13 minutes sounds like Kraftwerk for 30 seconds and then has one of those \"Illinois\" style chants for a further 8 minutes around the refrain of \"boy we can do much more together\" underpinned by all sort of beeps, electronic synths and weird machinations. It finishes with a fairly straightforward but gorgeous Stevens song with the \"boy\" lyrical refrain back again. Oh look, listen to it yourself and begin to connect with a song which has sections which will variously bore you, amaze you and often leave you in tears.\n\nThe \"Age of Adz\" is album devoid of discipline, restraint or brevity. It is a smorgasbord of ideas some of which work brilliantly, others fail gallantly and a few never get out of the starting gate. Certainly this a very different proposition to the mix of orchestrated packed bravado combined with the wintry acoustics of \"Michigan\" and \"Illinois\". Yet if the masterful experimentation of both those albums left you gasping for more \"The Age of Adz\" should hold no fear for you for this is pop or rock music in its loosest sense. Last year Stevens wrote a Stravinsky inspired album dedicated to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and only two months ago he released an EP entitled \"All you delighted people\" which extended to well over an hour. Stevens is a composer packed with musical ideas some great, some claptrap, some challenging and some sublime. What is the truth is that there no one else out there working this distinctive seam in this manner. Thereby \"The Age of Adz\" is full testimony to Stevens uniqueness and it should be a cause of great celebration and rejoicing for this is not so much an album release as a musical event.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Well, this is it, the seminal debut album of Hollywood Undead - Swan Songs.  I did not start here, though.  I only discovered HU through Day of the Dead, and then went back and collected all their other albums.  While I love all of them (I feel HUs quality across their works is very consistent), Ive noticed that I tend to listen to Day of the Dead and this album the most often.\n\nWhere do I start?  Well, theres a great variety of tracks on this debut album, ranging from party songs like Everywhere I go, to tracks like Undead and Paradise Lost that are harder-hitting.  All of them feature amazingly catchy backing instrumentals and choruses you can easily sing along to, along with a fair number of anthem-like themes of rebellion and discontent  perfect to get your blood pumping.  The only thing that originally gave me pause about this album is that it does seem to feature the least mature of their songs (which makes perfect sense given that this is their first release), but if you're willing to tolerate songs that contain the word weenie then its quite an enjoyable album.\n\nOh, and I must mention that I bought the physical cd, but I also suggest going to itunes and grabbing the extra bonus songs from the collectors edition.  They are well worth owning, in my opinion.\n\nOverall, Id have to say that this album is among one of my favorites, period.  If you are HU fan, then Im sure you already own this, but if you arent, then this is as fine a place to start as any.  Of course, people with low tolerances for gangsta personas and songs with a bit of immaturity need not apply.  I, however, rarely find albums that I love every single song on and can honestly say contain no filler tracks, so I heartily recommend Swan Songs.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Having read other people's reviews on this latest live album from Van Halen, I feel like putting in my 2 cents' worth as well.  I've been following all of VH's records (including the solo albums by David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar, respectively) since 1997, and they have gotten better over time.  I desperately wanted to get my hands on any VH album that was available -- whether by vinyl, cassette, or CD.\n\nWith the frequent personnel changes (i.e. Roth, Hagar, Cherone, then Roth again, then Wolfgang replacing Michael Anthony), it's a wonder how VH has stayed intact for so long.  But I have to give Eddie Van Halen and brother Alex for STILL having the energy of teenagers to pull off such awe-inspiring, amazing guitar\/drum solos.  It really shows on each song.\n\nAs for Roth, he's basically off-key and off-balance, ruining many of the songs that make the band famous in the first place (\"Unchained\", \"Everybody Wants Some!!\", \"I'll Wait\", \"Romeo Delight\"); however, I do give him an A+ for effort and still wanting to rock -- even now in his 60's.  Which is why it saddens me so much that his hot hell yelps, screaming banshee wails, and top octave range are all but GONE.  Still, it doesn't change how I feel about him as an overall individual; he deserves many accolades for the powerhouse voice that he USED to have.\n\nEddie, on the other hand, went through a very painful divorce with Valerie Bertinelli, dealt with hand surgery, and fired Michael Anthony because the (alleged) reason was that Michael was working with Hagar in his supergroup, Chickenfoot.  Enter, Eddie's son -- Wolfgang Van Halen.  Wolf pulls off all of the moves that Michael had, nearly note for note; you can clearly hear it when he battles it out alongside Eddie's solos and Alex's drums on \"Hot For Teacher\", \"Ice Cream Man\" and \"You Really Got Me.\"  Wolf has DEFINITELY got a huge, promising musical career ahead of him.  :)\n\nOf course, Eddie HIMSELF steals the show!!  For anyone that has loved hearing his solos for the past 4 decades, you won't be disappointed here.  The songs where he stands out the most are \"And The Cradle Will Rock...\", \"Panama\", \"Tattoo\", \"Mean Street\", and \"Jump.\"  But the HUGE kicker is \"Eruption\" when he starts out with his usual wailing, ear-shattering solo (and deftly battling it out with Alex's fast and furious drumming) before he segues into 1983's \"Cathedral\" from the Diver Down album, then back to \"Eruption\" once again.  He'll definitely go down in history as one of the greatest guitar gods of the 20th\/21st century, giving Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton a run for their money.  :)\n\nSo where does VH go from here??  Whom really knows, but since I am still a huge superfan of ALL 4 members (PLUS Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony), I'm still going back to hearing those early records.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"After twenty years on the scene, the artist wants to come out with something experimental. For most bands this is a signal that they're out of ideas and are about to collapse into radio nostalgia on way-back-weekends.\n\nNot Trent Reznor. The Ghosts are truly something very new on a long-known but previously underdeveloped foundation. Consider \"A Warm Place\" off Downward Spiral or the opening to \"Something I could never have\" off Pretty Hate Machine. These were reminders that beneath (and even coexisting with) the screams and mechanistic vicissitudes that define industrial music, Trent Reznor is a consummate musician.\n\n\"Ghosts\" is fully a harmonic successor to the atmospheric movements on the very underappreciated \"The Fragile\". Consider the 1999 album's \"La Mer\" or \"Pilgrimage\" as opposed to \"Where is Everybody?\" or \"The Wretched\". Not to say that NIN isn't atmospheric, but rather that there are definitely tracks with an intentional message as opposed to tracks that are more meant for the listener to get lost in. Ghosts is clearly the latter.\n\nThis is not an album you'll \"get\" in one sitting. It would fail miserably if it were so simplistic. Let it grow on you as you meditate through it.","classification":4,"fold":7}

ALL OF THEM!!!!\n\nIf you want to hear Blink 182 sound exactly like their did in the mid 90's, go get the Cheshire Car and Dude Ranch CD's. I promise you Blink 182 will sound EXACTLY like they did back in the day on those albums. It'll be like you took a ride in a time machine. Science!!!!\n\nIf you've grown up at all since 1995, and are willing to let your favorite bands grow a little as well, I think you'll like this 2016 album. It's a little different, but it's still them. The song themes are a little more mature, but then so am I. (I said a LITTLE more)\n\n Cynical - The beat really gets you going. The lyrics are pretty awesome as well. It's got a theme of \"what's the point\", hence the title 'Cynical'. It's a good song.\n\n Bored To Death - The lyrics here are really good. It's all about that feeling where nothing gets you excited, no matter how interesting it actually is. The chorus includes \"Life is too short to last long\". That sounds kind of dangerous...but then isn't life more fun that way? It's a really cool song. And the music rocks.\n\n She's Out Of Her Mind - The vocals are more prominent on this track, which works well because Matt Skiba is awesome. The song is one that anyone who's ever dated anyone is going to relate to pretty well. The whole song is awesome and is one of my favorites on the album.\n\n Los Angeles - This one didn't resonate with me. Maybe that's because I've spent a grand total of 24 hours in LA in my life. Maybe I just don't have the background to get it. The music wasn't particularly my favorite either. It's not a bad song. It's just not working for me.\n\n Sober - The theme here is \"I messed up bad because I'm drunk. I would like to take a recess from this argument until I am sober enough to properly defend my moronic behavior.\" That's the verbose version, but it pretty well explains it. As long as you're not currently in or suffering from the effects of a seminal situation it ends up being pretty funny. And the music is awesome. It's a great song on this one.\n\n Built The Pool - The whole track is 16 seconds long. It will.....catch you off guard. Then you will laugh.\n\n No Future - Liked the music. The lyrics didn't do anything for me. Neither did the overall sound of the vocals. Overall this was one of the few 'misses' on this album for me. But music is a funny thing...you might think it's the best song ever and wouldn't be wrong.\n\n Home Is Such A Lonely Place - This is a much more mellow sound than the rest of the album. It's a beautiful song. The vocals are fantastic. The lyrics discuss a really dark situation with a relationship that isn't what it once was. It's sad, but beautifully done.\n\n Kings Of The Weekend - From the first riff of this track, it's awesome. The lyrics are all about having a great weekend that's so awesome it might kill you, where you are in charge of your own destiny for 48 hours unlike the rest of the week when responsibility is in charge. This is a great song to start your weekend with! (It's Friday when I'm listening to it for the first time. It's putting me in the right mood)\n\n Teenage Satellites - The vocals are put through a weird filter that I'm not loving. But the band is rocking it. The song is cool. It's one of my least favorites on the album but I don't hate it.\n\n Left Alone - Sounds really cool. They do a vocal harmony on this one that's working well. The band sounds great. The lyrics are really well written but aren't going to resonate with everyone. Even if the words don't reach you, the sound is awesome and it's still a good track.\n\n Rabbit Hole - The song opens with \"Dear Head, shut up.\" It hooked me right from there because I can't recall how many times I've been in that mood, where I don't want to do the smart responsible thing. Sometimes I just want to react emotionally and not worry about the consequences!! This song is about that. And the music sounds great. This ended up being one of my favorites on the album. I love this track!\n\n San Diego - I've spent a lot more time in San Diego, but that wasn't what made me like this one. This song isn't really about the city, so much as the memories the singer has there with someone he once loved. San Diego is a euphemism for a happier time with an old love that he can't go back to. I've spent a lot of time in that San Diego too. This one resonated with me. It sounds awesome. Its' a great song.\n\n The Only Thing That Matters - I think this album is getting better towards the end because this is another one of my favorites. It's got a happy upbeat theme about a great love making everything right with your world. The music is probably the fasted paced on the album. It really gets you moving. It's another great song!\n\n California - They slowed it down for this on. The band takes a very back seat to the vocals here. It's very mellow music (I wasn't sure Blink 182 knew how to do that) It's a great song. It's beautifully sung. It's all about imagining the perfect life.\n\n Brohemian Rhasody - It's 30 seconds long. It's got one line. It's funny.\n\nAll in all, listen to this. Enjoy it.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I have long thought of the Bangles as a second tier band, sort of the ugly stepsisters to the more enjoyable GoGo's, and nowhere near in the same league as the Cinderella of all groups, Fanny (still the premiere all-female band). I've always liked the group, I just wasn't moved by them. Too much of the time they seemed like four individuals fighting for the solo spotlight, versus a tight, together unit. Well, all that has changed with DOLL REVOLUTION, the new release from 2003's Most Improved act. Tight, cohesive and intelligent, this is a group to be reckoned with. This is clear right from the start; the disc opens with a blistering cover of Elvis Costello's \"Tear Off Your Own Head.\" Susanna Hoff's opening \"HEY!\" only hints at things to come in the rest of the song...hand claps, a pounding rhythm section, tinkling piano and soaring vocals coalesce, resulting in one of the Bangles' best, hardest rocking songs to date. \"Stealing Rosemary\" has a rockin', neo-folk vibe to it, while \"Something That You Said\" has a delicate (yet fresh) techno groove behind it's hushed vocals and tender lyrics. This touching song of true love (\"Showing you every weakness and feeling strong for it\/I used to run from real love now I long for it\/Now I know what I've been missing\/Since I've been listening\") features an assured lead vocal from Hoffs, probably her best to date. The same could be said about Debbi Peterson and her aching take on \"Ask Me No Questions.\" Gorgeous harmonies round out this beauty. \"The Rain Song\" has to be one of my favorite tracks. A mid-tempo rocker, it sports a gutsy lead vocal from guitarist Vicki Peterson and smart lyrics (\"I don't think about us much anymore\/Frankly the topic has become a bore\" and \"I don't think about us when I'm sleeping\/It doesn't even cross my dreamlike mind\/And I don't think I see your face through the curtains\/Hell, I don't even miss you half the time\"). This is an AC hit waiting to happen! Bassist Michael Steele steps into the spotlight and shines on her groovy \"Nickel Romeo.\" This cut is a great example of how much the group has grown into a more unified musical unit. \"Ride The Ride\" is a rollicking group effort, while \"I Will Take Care Of You\" is another gentle Hoffs number. \"Here Right Now\" is a real gem that slowly grew on me. Drummer Debbi Peterson was always kind of \"the kid sister who has to be in the band\" to me, sort of a female Ringo, but she has SO come into her own on DOLL REVOLUTION, both as a vocalist and lyricist (\"In and outta town\/Time for you to settle down\/Stand back, take a look around you\/You're runnin' from the pressures of the restless world\/Hush for a moment, baby just be still\"). Captivating....simply captivating! From here we segue into another favorite, Vicki Peterson's hauntingly dark \"Single By Choice.\" With it's opening chorus (\"Single by choice\/Never married, never ever divorced\/Listen to the solitary voice\/Tell you I'm single by choice\"), one might think there's a bitterness to the song, but nothing could be farther from the truth...as you get deeper into the track, you see there's an intelligence and life-experience to it that's missing from much of today's music (\"I know what you're thinkin'\/She can't be complete\/Til the right kind of man\/Comes sweep her off her feet\/Well I've been there before\/Times four, times five\/With the right kind of man\/Barely made it out alive\"). Brava, Ms. Peterson (kind of ironic, though, that Vicki just got engaged)! \"Lost At Sea\" is another winner from Peterson's baby sister...Debbi once again shines on this heartfelt ballad that builds and soars, with spot-on lyrics that everyone can identify with (\"Can we try to salvage what we can\/From the weight of water and sand\/Lift us up again\", \"Well,you walk\/Never ever looking back\/One defends and one attacks\/There's a thousand reasons to begin again\"). \"Song For A Good Son\" is a great story-song from Steele. Intense and propulsive, the lyrics are stunningly visual - sort of a mini movie! - and Michael delivers them with conviction and in a strong, authoritative vocal. \"Mixed Messages\" and \"Between The Two\" are probably my two least favorite tracks on DOLL REVOLUTION, not because they're bad, just because everything else is so strong. \"Mixed Messages\" has a nice enough 60's feel to it, while \"Between The Two\" has a soaring (albeit slightly forced) intensity. The disc closes with the gorgeous \"Grateful.\" Be it an ode to her children or a musical thank-you to her fellow band members for a successful second chance together, the song is delivered from Hoffs' heart and gut. Floating out of your speakers, it makes you thankful for unexpected opportunities and small surprises. Much the same could be said about DOLL REVOLUTION!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Armed with a contract from the fledgling Arista record label and building on the success of the stripped back \"Winter in America\", Gil Scott-Heron and musical partner Brian Jackson entered the studio to record \"The First Minute of the New Day\".  Whereas \"Winter in America\" was largely just Scott-Heron and Jackson, \"The First Minute of the New Day\" is fully arranged music sitting close to a vocal jazz style, but with a healthy dose of funk overtones.  The sound on this record is distinctive and quite unlike much of Scott-Heron's other work-- in part because of the presence of additional vocalist Victor Brown.  Brown's high tenor provides a fantastic offset to Scott-Heron's lower register, and the two harmonize to great effect.  The band supporting them is essentially a sax quartet (Bilal Sunni Ali on reeds, Jackson on piano, Danny Bowens on electric bass and Bob Adams on drums) augmented by a trio of percussionists-- Charlie Saunders, Eddie Knowles and Barnett Williams.  The band whips up a blues\/jazz\/funk stew, anchored effectively by Bowens, who proves stunningly agile and effective, weaving in and out of the delicate wall of percussion and the melodies.\n\nThe pieces themselves on the album are staggering in their diversity, from a mournful blues (\"Winter in America\") to a delicate and serene jazz ballad (\"Offering\") to deep funk (\"The Liberation Song\") and spoken word (\"Pardon Our Analysis\").  As expected, Scott-Heron's lyrical wit is in full effect, whether discussing the politics of Africa, the Nixon administration, the state of the nation or just reflections on everyday life, he's nothing short of brilliant.\n\nThis reissue augments the album with a pair of bonus tracks- an extended spoken word piece including a reprise of Scott-Heron's famed \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\" (and one of the most brilliant performances on record by him in spoken word) and a solo performance of \"Winter in America\" from the late '70s.  All of this is remastered and sounds superb.\n\nIt's not quite the masterpiece that it's predecessor (\"Winter in America\") or its successor (\"From South Africa to South Carolina\") is, but \"The First Minute of a New Day\" is a fantastic album, capturing an artist at his peak.  Highly recommended.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"This review addresses the vinyl version of the album. The double-LP was pressed by Pallas (Germany) on 180-gram vinyl over three sides. The fourth side is an \"etching\". There is a free included CD of the entire album as well. The vinyl was perfectly flat and dead quiet across all three sides (typical of Pallas), at least on my copy. If you have a decent analog system, the differences between this LP and the digital version is immediately apparent, especially on tracks such as \"Turn It Up\", with its soft\/loud dynamics, reverb-inflected vocals and deep, tight bass, all stunningly presented on the vinyl. There is, on my relatively humble system, a superior width and depth of the soundstage as well as that sense of \"air\" around the vocals and instruments such as one hears at a live event. Doing a direct A\/B comparison, the LP betters the CD in every way (no surprise there). I saw comments on this site regarding \"poor production\" (done by Plant), which I don't understand at all.

I mean, this girl comes off the American Idol of England, comes to the states, and this song comes out of nowhere building radio play all the way to #1. What's the secret? Apparently America just loves those female R&B Love Song vibes.\n\nLeona Lewis herself has a rather good voice, and carries herself pretty well throughout the song. The song itself is pretty darn standard in the R&B Love Song genre, so it could be sung by Mariah, or any artist in that mold for that matter. No ground is broken, but it is a nice listen, and so far, it has not annoyed me to death, so that's always a positive.\n\nSo overall, nothing brilliant, nothing new, but Leona Lewis seems to nice enough to be let on my radio dial. And, even though this might be saying much, this song might be better than most of Mariah's work, since her stuff is so overly done, it's pathetic.

In fact, it was during these recordings that Ian McDonald was asked to join. Several of the songs here would end up in the setlists of the original King Crimson lineup and I Talk To the Wind was redone for In The Court Of The Crimson King. One of the two versions of I Talk To The Wind on here would end up on 1976's A Young Person's Guide To King Crimson. If you're a fan of King Crimson, you'll dig this.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Theres always that album that will stay in your ears forever. And this is one of them I was around 7-10 years old in 2003, and I remember how soul siring the songs \"Voice of Truth\", \"We Are The Body\" and \"Who Am I\" appeared on the radio for the first time. That is such an overrated statement. These songs were more then soul stirring. They were convicting and pinned the nail right on the donkey. Even for such a kid like I was. I can't believe how raw this album is, looking back at it. The lyrics are phenomenal. But it doesn't stop there; the instruments, the key signatures, octaves, rhythms and melodies. They play a very key role in this album.  Listen to this essential hit, which is one of CCM music greatest Debuts right next to DC Talk's \"Jesus Freak\", Newsboys' \"Shine,  Mercyme's \"Almost There\", Rich Mullins' Raggamuffin Band\", and so many more.","classification":5,"fold":7}

With this album, she evokes a timeless voice for this decade. She is next to Aretha, Patti, Whitney, and Mariah. I hope she gets the success with this album.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"It is hard to believe that today is the first anniversary since Whitney Houston's saddened death. While the music industry has seen dramatic changes, what it has not been able to show is a clearness and depth of someone and their beautiful voice. Whitney Houston showcased more bravado and simplicity in her songs that still withstand the test of time more than any of the songs that today's acts could reach. That stands with her biggest template, I Will Always Love You from The Bodyguard, and off of her hits record I Will Always Love You: The Best Of Whitney Houston. The song still is just as majestic as it was when it first came out 20 years ago, and just the strike of the notes that Whitney had delivered is still with brilliance. This is a must download for anyone whom has never heard a brilliant note from Whitney Elizabeth Houston. She will always be loved.\n\nWhitney Houston 1963-2012\n\nSong: A","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"This rating isn't fair to Don Henley but then again Henley would probably agree when I say \"that's life and life can sometimes be a bitch\". I'm rating this CD after only listening to samples of each of the songs. And while I find most of the songs to be pleasant to listen to I find that the majority of them are slow paced.\n\n Even at my present age I prefer livelier tunes and while Henley still has an excellent voice I realize that his writing is still much more melancholy than I enjoy. In large doses I find slower introspective songs just so damned boring!  On those few songs that he picks up the pace I find myself enjoying the music more. Come on Henley get over yourself!  Hey now there's a good title for a song! I call \"Dibs\" on any royalties you get from using my title!\n\nPS: Here's a huge hint; if you're going to sample songs that are duets with other famous singers, then make sure the samples contain parts where your singing partner is part of the samples with you!

I suspect I heard this song so many times when I was small, it's remained permanently lodged in my brain ever since.  And honestly, for its era, this is probably one of the most sexually open songs out there.  What, you think he wants her to stay so they can play another game of Canasta?

{"text":"\"Pure McCartney\" is a compilation put together by Paul himself, it's just solo material, so no Beatles stuff. If you have all of his albums, it's redundant, if not, this is a fun listen. Of course all of the big hits are here, but also a bunch of later album cuts. Nearly every album is represented (except for his 1989 \"Flowers In The Dirt\", which is too bad because it has some great stuff on it). What I like is that more well known songs are mixed in among the newer or otherwise lesser known tracks. Pretty much the only song I haven't liked is \"My Love\" which I've never liked. I have the live albums and the other Hits albums, I have a handful of the solo albums, but I think the last one I got was \"Flaming Pie\". So for me, this set is sort of an introduction to his more recent material. I've been playing this all day and it's done what Paul set out to do with it, it's just a fun playlist of various solo songs.\n My only complaint is that nothing from \"Flowers In The Dirt\" is on this, the reason probably being that the Archive Collection edition comes out later this year. However if this \"My Brave Face\" or \"Put It There\" I'd give this five stars.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"When Modest Mouse hit the scene with this song a few years ago, it took awhile for the modern rock crowd to accept originality and great riffs in their music. In fact, it probably wouldn't have hit #1 if it hadn't been for Nickelback being in the studio with their best-seller. But when they finally came around to the song, they saw it for what it was, an original rock piece that would go down as a rock classic from the 2000's, and a riff that would go down in history as the bumper-music for many a radio program.\n\nRight off the bat, you get those classic rock riffs that just scream awesome with every note. They're memorable, rockin', and most importantly, original. The verses continue the trend with the catchiness and the trademark Modest Mouse style. It might not make the most sense at first, but it all blends in one amazing song. And even though those trademark Modest Mouse vocals are incredibly hard to work-around usually, in this song they're perfect. Nope, original songs require original vocals. No Nickelback notes are allowed here.\n\nOverall, this is going to be one of those songs that goes down in those Rolling Stone best of music books. It's original in every manner, and it has great riffs and chords to keep you rockin' through the night. Modest Mouse's best by a mile, and it's nice to know there's still classic rock ruling the radio waves.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.\n\nI can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title \"The Essential Jim Reeves.\" To please everyone would be nigh on impossible considering the fact he had 80 Country hit singles between 1953 and 1984, 27 of which crossed over to the Hot 100, six to the Adult Contemporary charts (which didn't begin until 1961), and one to the R&B charts. Never mind the hundreds of equally-wonderful selections from his many EPs and LPs.\n\nAll in all, however, I'd say he did a fairly credible job, augmented by five pages of liner notes by Colin Escott and three more photos of Jim, including one with wife Mary at an Awards ceremony. A partial discography of the contents is also included, but without any chart details.\n\nAll but track 20 [recorded in 1958 and included on an early LP] were hits for Jim, 18 of them pop crossovers [only track 4 made only the Country list, going to # 2 early in 1959]. His version of the old standard, I Love You Because, was recorded in 1962 and was first released on the RCA Victor LP Gentleman Jim and, in 1976, became a # 54 Country hit as a single.\n\nNote, too, that the version of Am I Losing You was the one cut in 1960 and released on RCA Victor 7800, going to # 8 Country\/# 31 Hot 100 as the flipside of I Missed Me [# 3 Country\/# 44 Hot 100 and not included here], The first version, done in 1957 [# 3 Country], remains a bit difficult to find.\n\nThe earliest hit represented here, and the one that leads off the disc, is Four Walls [# 1 Country for EIGHT weeks in 1957] which was his initial pop crossover [# 11]. However, this came after 13 Country hits beginning in 1953 with Mexican Joe [# 1 for NINE weeks credited to Jim Reeves And The Circle O Ranch Boys].\n\nSo I tend to agree with another reviewer who says that at least one of those should have been included in an \"essential\" CD. Not counting the first six, five of which were for the Abbott label and one, I Love You, a # 3 duet with Ginny Wright on the Fabor label, there were seven RCA cuts to choose from. The best of these included the afore-mentioned Am I Losing You, as well as Yonder Comes A Sucker and According To My Heart, both # 4s.\n\nStill, it's hard to be critical of this fine effort which richly deserves every one of the maximum 5 stars.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Grizzly Bear's fourth album \"Shields\" is one to work at and preserver with. On first listens its all a bit complex, fussy, unsettling and wayward. There is no Beach Boys style pure pop such as \"Two Weeks\" to draw you in, or razor sharp indie rock like \"The Knife\" to play over and over again. The band comprising Daniel Rossen, Ed Droste, Chris Taylor and Chris Bear decamped to Texas in an abandoned military base and were fed musically on an eclectic diet of rap and Talk Talk's magnificent \"Laughing Stock'. The latter is an album which creeps up on you by revealing more of itself on every listen like a musical striptease and its pleasing to report that \"Shields\" plays a similar waiting game to the new listener. The opener \"Sleeping Ute\" has been round the music blogs as much as Sir Chris Hoy has covered the Olympic velodrome track. It is because of this that what would sound like a strange start now seems so familiar. Its swirling psychedelia with a heavy pop slant for some reason reminds this reviewer of a 10cc song that is about to spontaneously combust. It punches and rages until 3 minutes in it turns into a a flowing Spanish sounding acoustic ballad with a lovely Droste vocal. This album is all about layers and the free flowing \"Speak in rounds\" has so much going on in the background that the listener struggles mentally to pick up its different parts. But then it clicks and all of a sudden its one of the albums best tracks.\n\nMore pop orientated but by equally demanding are songs such as \"Yet Again\" where Droste starts off with the big claim \"Yet again we're the only ones\/no surprise this is often how its done\". This is no idle boast for its hard to think of many bands that plough this particular furrow which at its best can be completely compelling. \"The hunt\" for example is a beautiful ballad but its structures are angular and background instrumentation often jarring. Much more straightforward is the excellent \"A Simple answer\" which shows that sometimes the more stripped down Grizzly Bear has more to offer than the complex Grizzly Bear. In this respect quite why the dreary instrumental \"Adelma\" is present is a mystery but it only last a a minute so a small complaint. It is interesting that their counterparts\/rivals the Animal Collective have a song \"Today's supernatural\" on their new album \"Centipede Hz\" which owes a debt to the French pop masters \"Phoenix\", and in the track \"Gun-shy\" easily the most accessible track on the album Grizzly Bear has performed a matching exercise of dreamy introspection. The best however is saved to last firstly with the rolling chamber music of \"Half Gate\" which has a huge cinematic feel which builds to a big swirling finale. Finally nothing else on the album comes close to the sheer perfection that is the last song on Shields; the seven minute plus \"Sun in your eyes\". In the same way that \"Foreground\" provided a suitable climax to \"Veckatimest\" this follows the format of a slowly building piano ballad but it is populated with high octane choruses and unusual time signatures that pull it out of shape. By 4.30 minutes it seems to mutuate into a different piece of music that soars to a massive climax and reintroduces the hook \"Stretched out, fallen wide\/The light has scorched the same\/So bright, so long\/I'm never coming back\" where Droste literally sings his heart out until it gently fades.\n\nMany bands go through album after album and will never come close to this heightened level of musical ecstasy. And whilst there remains a nagging doubt that Grizzly Bears masterpiece is yet to come the point of \"Shields\" is to present an album which is populated by staging posts of sheer sublime beauty but which often requires travel on densely populated harmonic paths and byways to reach this satisfying destination. Should you choose to accept the journey the rewards are rich since Grizzly Bear again prove their impeccable credentials as a fiercely independent band and \"Shields\" is one of there most memorable collections.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I pulled this CD out of my shelf the other day and the songs were just as good as I remembered from when I purchased this back in 2010. Songs such as \"Do you Love Me\", better than the Contours version and the best version I've heard, \"Glad All Over\", \"Bits and Pieces\", \"Can't you See That She's Mine\", both songs titled \"Everybody Knows\", \"Catch Us If you Can\", \"I Like It Like That\", \"Because\" and the previously unreleased \"Universal Love\", which has the same corde progression as Marmalade's \"Reflections Of My Life\". Also loved the lowd haunting \"Ninteen Days\", a nice blues rock song about being lonely. \"Everybody Knows (We're Through\" was covered by Engelbert Humperdinck and both versions are great. Sadly I got rid of the imbossed outer box to this package. I happily have the 28 page booklet included, but I am not fond of the liner notes here because it makes Dave Clark sound very selfish. It only mentions stuff about him and no other band members. I was expecting that to happen as he is a really greedy selfish man who always resists the chance to keep his albums available on CD. When he passes away, there is a better chance of more CD reissues as the masters will be lisenced to his family and maybe we'll see them on CD in the future. I don't really want to say this, but hurry up, Dave and die! so your fantastic music becomes available forever on CD.","classification":5,"fold":7}

It has that 80's New York blues feel to it and plays with chord progressions that move in unexpected places; making a melody that is both complex and familiar. Elton's singing is at its best here. The song takes me to places when I hear it. He sings like a smooth and mellow crooner, giving a little edge just where the song needs it. I am baffled this track wasn't included in any of the greatest hits collections. It was a top ten song on the UI.K. and and top 15 in the U.S.\n\nIf you love ballads or mellow songs that are a cut different than your standard pop tune that are still catchy and beautiful you must do yourself a favor and check out Blue Eyes.","classification":5,"fold":7}

But while other talented artists have now inserted their names into the discussion, I feel that Flame, like Da Truth, has fallen out of it. His last few albums have received high marks, but the artists he enlists have often over shown his own work.\n\nThere are a ton of average songs on this album, but a few are terrific. All In, Sanctuary, Read Em' and Weep, and especially Start Over are very good. However, KB, V Rose, and NF played a majority in the reason that 3 of those tracks are good. Flame's flow is just decent, and he doesn't have the it factor, the ability to drop lines and rhymes that make me ponder or flinch. They're more simple, and very \"been there, heard that\" in christian rap. VERY been there, heard that.\n\nNow this album isn't bad, just a bit tired. Its a 3-star album bolstered to a 4 by great guest performances and a strong, faithful message. By all means, go ahead and get this if you like rap, like I do. But there are better albums, and I suggest getting those too.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"I write this as more a tribute to Lee's accomplishment's throughout his life and career.  If you hadn't heard, he passed away unexpectedly in March of 2013.  I first heard of him in 1971 while living back east where a healthy dose of reinterpreted blues from England was taking place.  Ssssh was the first album i purchased, but for some crazy reason, Watt became a big favorite of mine.  I recently went through a bit of nostalgia and repurchased the Deram TYA and the predecessor to this album, Lee's last.  Like Kim Simmonds, Lee brought a different dimension to the blues he interpreted.  Faster.  Yet he wasn't afraid to coast into the song either, playing softly while others took the spotlight.  I guess his death was so much a shock more than anything else.  He wasn't reported ill.  Thanks for the music, Alvin.  May your path take you home!","classification":5,"fold":7}

First, it has been available in very high quality form since Joe Pope released it on a series of 45s on his own Deccagone label in approximately 1974.  It then appeared on several LPs, two of which I own, in the 80s.  These were not \"bootlegs\" in the traditional sense.  They were excellent quality and were probably legal recordings at that time.  I don't know if there has ever been a legal release of this material on CD, but there are at least two (probably many  more) really good quality bootleg CDs that contain this material, in true studio quality, with no hiss or surface noise.\n\nFinally, there are 3 original Lennon\/McCartney songs: Loved of the Loved, Hello Little Girl and Like Dreamers Do.

You can absolutely feel the love and respect from the bands for each other and the music, and boy oh boy the peaks are breath-taking. I tend to crack up in laughter at moments throughout this recording, the intensity is so overwhelming. These are some of the best jazz players the genre has produced, veterans of four decades of swing at this point in 1961, and this one-off meeting never disappoints.\n\n  Having each band in one channel makes this surreal on good headphones. Nice production too, solid remaster with the brass register rarely shrill.\n\nAlong with Cannonball Adderley's Know What I Mean?, this is one of the sweetest semi-unknown jazz recordings. If you know someone who says jazz doesn't rock, just throw on cut one, crank it loud and proud, and step back with a smile.\n\n  Are there any musicians of this calibre still alive? I can't seem to find them...","classification":5,"fold":7}

Lonnie Mack plays bass on it, that's pretty cool. The opening guitar is just what I'd expect to hear at a roadhouse. Bikers and chains. Then I'd expect the beer drinkin, the sweat, the hollerin, the name callin, the fightin, but I don't know. I've never been to a roadhouse and I've never seen the Patrick Swayze film.

{"text":"The robot rock space men are back after five years since their last album. I've only listen to this album twice since thursday when I got it in the mail. I am a big powerman 5000 fan, got into them like a lot of people did with their album (tonight the stars revolt). I like the album, but i'm hoping it grows on me a little bit. I like for bands to try new things and change their sound up a little bit and I think Spider-one and co do that on this album. The frist two tracks are heavier than anything I have heard by powerman since Tonight the stars revolt. The album starts off strong but my opinion sort of lulls in the middle. But I really dig the track \"I want to kill you\" its got sort of a david bowie, space odity classic rock vibe I really dig and wasn't expecting from powerman. The track really shows off Spider's voice. Alot great tracks, it totally sounds like powerman. I'm glad Spider and co are going back to their trademark sound of Tonight, and Anyone for doomsday! A cool effort and I hope it becomes a classic one day like their others. I saw them live a couple of weeks ago and the new songs sound killer live. I hope to hear more robot rock from these spacemen in the future!","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I tended to think late Dead albums weren't so hot until I bought the GarciaLive album from the 1990's and thought that it was fine.  So I bought this, and it's really good.  It isn't a single concert but selections from a tour, and the selections have been very well made.  I don't think I've heard the Dead cover \"This could be the last time\" on any other album, and they do a nice job here.  Also \"Loser,\" which is on many concert albums, really comes across well here -- Jerry's vocals are particularly strong.  And I agree with the reviewers who praise Brent Mydland's work here.  I love Keith Godchaux (and really miss Donna Jean's vocal contribution) but Mydland is his own man -- in some ways more interventionist in the aural mix than Keith tended to be.  His songs and singing are fine with me too, though I realize he's an acquired taste.  \"West L. A. Fadeaway\" and \"Feel Like a Stranger\" were new to me, and very attractive.  On the second disc, The opening three songs were strong, and I love \"Morning Dew\" (soulful stuff), which is really nicely done here.  A nice mix, then, of the familiar and unfamiliar, well performed and in good sound.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Have listened to it on multiple road trips since purchasing to keep my spirits up and road rage down.  Never disappointed; if anything, it gets better with every listen.  Personal favorite tracks include \"Your Girl\", \"Biggest Fan\", and \"Instigators\".  There are none that I truly dislike but I will say that \"Nobody's Born with a Broken Heart\" and \"Low\" were the most difficult for me to get into.

Mick and Lou coulda gotten back together and been Foreigner once again.\n\nBut the truth of the matter is that Foreigner now sounds better than they ever did, ever since Gramm permanently left the band several years back.  And Lou has lost most of his singing ability, so Kelly Hanson is actually a true blessing to the band.  He perhaps sounds the most like Lou Gramm than anyone else out there whom I've heard, even Lou Gramm himself (in his current condition).\n\nI empathize with those who say that Foreigner is no longer Foreigner with Mick being the only remaining original member.  But the current line-up does a wonderful job of cranking out the old tunes.  My biggest complaint with Foreigner is that Mick Jones continues to push his band toward Pop music, when everyone knows that deep inside him, that rocker is just waiting to burst back out!","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Live by the compilation, die by the compilation.  Maybe that's not quite how the saying goes, but that's what's going on with Cash Money effort<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Rich-Gang\/dp\/B00CAZOHVQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rich Gang<\/a>.  The compilation effort features a host of artists including Birdman, Lil Wayne, Future, Ace Hood, Detail, Nicki Minaj, and others.  With so much talent on the roster, you would think that this effort would be a home run. Unfortunately, that's just not the case.  Regardless whether they are called 'Rich Gang' or not, too many rhymes are spent bragging of monetary excess with little other substance.  There's is nothing wrong with the occasional bragging about a 'come up', but Birdman particularly seems incredibly materialistic.\n\nThe effort gets off to a rather lethargic start with brief cuts in \"R.G.\" and \"Million Dollar\".  \"R.G.\" reintroduces Mystikal to the world, but don't call it valedictory as he's indecipherable and too manic for the most part.  On \"Million Dollar\", Detail and Future pair up for nothing short of an autotune laden mess.  By the time prize cut \"Tapout\" arrives, much of the anticipation has come and gone.  Nonetheless, \"Tapout\" is more signature Cash Money, featuring Future, Mack Maine, Lil Wayne, Birdman, and Nicki Minaj.  It's raunchy and unapologetic, particularly Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj's contributions.  \"We Been On\" follows up, featuring Birdman, Lil Wayne and R. Kelly. If 'raunch' characterized \"Tapout\", it's all about bragging about the money flow on \"We Been On\".  R. Kelly paints a picture of cigars, Audemars (luxury watches), and foreign cars.  Lil Wayne isn't nearly as nasty as his previous showing, but that doesn't keep him from remaining very sensually charged.  \"We Been On\" should be a turn-off, but it's actually a decent cut.\n\n\"Dreams Come True\" continues the money trip, but it also is a good one. That said, Birdman's rhymes could use a shake up, though I'll spot him a pass on \"moving eleven, strapped with a mack \/ a hundred G's in a duffle bag stacked.\" Rick Ross gets his own track on \"50 Plates\" which should be awesome without a rub, but basically its pretty typical for the MC who has rapped about his bank account a million times it seems. \"Bigger Than Life\" is confident as well, but tickles the fancy.  Chris Brown makes the song, contributing a verse, the hook, and a bridge. Birdman, Tyga, and Lil Wayne all provide verses.  On \"100 Favors\", Kendrick Lamar steals the show on his third verse. It's not the greatest song, but it trumps \"Everyday\" which is average at best and the horrid Detail feature \"Burn the House\".  \"Panties to the Side\" is an improvement, but definitely not tasteful.  Even so, French Montana seems perfect for the hook given a previous hit entitled \"Pop That\".  \"Angel\" is a solid penultimate cut, easily eclipsing a clumsy closer in \"Sunshine\", which features the odd combination of Limp Bizkit, Flo Rida, and Birdman.  Yeah really?\n\nUltimately,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Rich-Gang\/dp\/B00CAZOHVQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rich Gang<\/a>'s wealth is too based in materialism as opposed to quality. Some of it works and other parts fall flat and uninspired. It's a shade below average in my eyes, particularly given a lack of memorability throughout this 13-track affair.","classification":3,"fold":7}
{"text":"Foreigner's Feels Like the First Time is a triple disc release containing two audio cds and one dvd. The first cd is Foreigner unplugged playing many of their hits acoustic. CD two contains rerecordings of Foreigner's greatest hits with the current line up. The rerecordings are quite good as the band plays the songs just like the original recordings. Kelly Hansen's vocals sound close to Lou Gramm's voice as well. Like I said the rerecordings are good, but they won't replace the original versions. A concert dvd finishes off the set. As far as I know this concert has not been previously released in the United States. The concert runs about 90 minutes, with all the standards like Double Vision, Cold as Ice, Hot Blooded, Juke Box Hero, etc. Feels Like the First Time is not an essential purchase for Foreigner fans, but when you can pick up two cds & a dvd for under twelve dollars you really have no reason to complain because you don't like one or even two of the items. If you enjoy just one of the three you got your money's worth. I bought this for the dvd. I would have gladly paid a little more for it.

I wouldn't rank \"Hard Bargain\" among my five favorite albums by Emmylou (she has so many great ones, that it's hard to crack the top tier), but nevertheless there is a lot to enjoy on here. These are well-crafted songs with atmosphere and passion, lyrics that are reflective and meditative. All in all, a very stirring, evocative collection of songs.

{"text":"I won't pretend that I've listened to all of this massive collection. Like many prospective purchasers, I bought the set to supplement my LPs of Woldike's Haydn performances that I acquired in my undergraduate days. I somehow never got around to purchasing the Vanguard CDs of the symphonies and \"The Creation\" when they were in print so the MP3s were a no-brainer, particularly at the give away price. How do they do it? Have the artists (or their estates) waived royalties?\n\nHow do the digital files compare to to my cherished LPs? Quite well, thank you. Despite loving care, cleaning, careful calibration of cartridge tracking weights, and audiophile inner sleeves the Sterolab pressings show the effects of 40 years of playback. Room tone and ambiance often goes by the wayside in digitized files along with what, for want of a better term, is characterized as \"warmth.\" Again, not so in this case. Strings actually sound like bowed strings rather than what LP fanatics characterize as \"grains of rice dropped on tissue paper.\" I'm playing them through an external 24 bit\/192khz DAC in an \"audiophile\" system that bypasses the usual mediocre sonics of computer audio to get the best out of them. They do not disappoint.\n\nI look forward to further explorations in the weeks to come.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Indeed, the French master, Claude Debussy used Grieg's String Quartet as a template for his own String Quartet.\n\nApart from Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto #1 and perhaps the two piano concertos by Brahms; Grieg's Piano Concerto is probably the best piano concerto of the Romantic Era.\n\nGrieg's Piano Sonata might be the greatest piano sonata of the Romantic Era bar none.\n\nAll of these outstanding works can be heard in this collection of Grieg's music; and you get it for less than $3.\n\nWhile I'm not familiar with any of the performers; my reaction was that the playing was sincere and more than adequate.\n\nApart from the above mentioned works, and the very popular \"Peer Gynt\"; are also Grieg's piano music and songs which are all quite lovely.\n\nTo the novice, I would advise that this is not thunderous music along the lines of Beethoven or Brahms. Don't expect to hear anything big and brassy. Grieg composed a smaller scale creating lovely little flowers as opposed to powerful mountains and delicate snowflakes as opposed to raging storms.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Besides Rehab, my favorite track is called Love Is A Losing Game, a gem of a song with a beautiful melody in the lost love tradition. Another great one is You Know I'm No Good with its powerful sax. And Me & Mr Jones is a stunner. The music gains a distinctive flavor through the use of samples from classic 1960s pop songs, while the lyrics are intelligent and mature. There is a certain authenticity to this seamless blend of funk, torch, R&B and pop grooves that reaches the heart and soul. It's rare to find an album these days where every single track is memorable; Back To Black has thus been a very pleasant surprise. Judging by this excellent CD, Winehouse will prove to be a major force in the years to come.","classification":4,"fold":7}

He won the Grammy for Bust A Move, which led me to listening to the album more.  Got More Rhymes, Just Say No, much of the album's second half could rival any of today's artists that ride on a negative image.  Matt Dike, and this Ross fellow did a fine job producing this album as well as Tone Loc's album on the same label of Delicious Vinyl.

All of the 13 songs are quite a pleasurable listen, and if one has not listened to Swifts version, this is definitely a treat.  This somewhat reminds this listener of the musical artists of the past of the 1950s and 1960s where cover versions were the mainstay, and at times, were better or equal in sound as the original -- 1989 is that record.\n\nEvery song is memorable and a few are worth mentioning.  The opening song Welcome to New York provides a nice start for the record with a bit of pop energy.  The proceeding tracks are the singles Blank Space and Style that are comparable to the originals.  And for listeners accustomed to Adamss folk and country and rock sound Out of the Woods and Shake it off, offer the touch.  One of the beautiful ballads on the record This Love is also exceptional as well.\n\nWhether listeners are interested in Taylor Swifts pop and dance version to Ryan Adams eclectic rendering, both are worth a listen and a nice addition to ones play list.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Has the new working class American hero just walked into the room or what?\n\nRest In Chaos delivers a dusty bluesy countrified bit of rock n roll with some jam band psychedelic influences laced around the edges that allow it to go down easy, and dance across your ears long after the songs are over.  Hard Working Americans lay out a series of stories, and whether they're true or not doesnt matter in the least, cause Im taking em to heart, like they're happening down the street, in the car next to me at the light, and in the supermarket, where I get a whiff of weed as the guy in a tattered muscle shirt rolls by me, with all the wrong stuff filling his cart.\n\nThis is pure rock n roll with a sinister attitude belaying disorder, dystopia and an unsavory desire for salvation.  But not salvation from God, rather from skeptics and the streetwise, where gunslingers carry a hard-lived six string, and ride in muscle-cars shot with gray primer and windows that never roll up.  This is a band with a deep bottom and lyrics that hold your attention, sounding lost, forgotten, disregarded, impossible to ignore, and delivers an album that shivers with heart ... making the last minutes of the day seem like the best youve ever lived.\n\nReview by Jenell Kesler","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I love Owl City.  Even if it's only one guy with a synthesizer, it still produces a unique and cheerful sound, full of whimsy and beauty without being overly cutesy.  I fell in love with Adam Young's music with his huge hit \"Fireflies,\" and have grown to like other songs of his such as \"Alligator Sky\" and \"Peppermint Winter.\"  Even his contributions to movie soundtracks, such as \"When Can I See You Again?\" (from \"Wreck-It Ralph\") and \"To the Skies\" (from \"Legend of the Guardians\") are fun and enjoyable.\n\nWith \"Shine Your Way,\" yet another soundtrack contribution, Owl City seems to be shifting more toward the pop end of the spectrum.  But despite this genre shift, this song is still uniquely his, and is an upbeat and happy number.\n\nUnlike many of Adam Young's songs, this one's a duet -- singer Yuma joins in the song.  Her voice fits Adam's quite well, both having a dreamy and youthful quality that helps maintain the upbeat and cheery feeling of the song.  The whimsical electronic sounds of previous songs are mostly replaced by more traditional-sounding musical accompaniment here, with an emphasis on violin-sounding synthesizer and a drum track.  It's a different sound from Owl City, sounding more pop-like than his previous songs, but it's still quite enjoyable.\n\nThe lyrics to this song fit the movie perfectly.  Just as \"The Croods\" was about a family struggling to find their way during dark times, the song talks about finding the light in the dark times and not being afraid.  There are even references to the family's discovery of fire in the song.  While the song can stand well on its own, it's also a perfect number to close the movie.\n\nOwl City \"purists\" may dislike the more pop-like feeling of this song, but I still enjoyed it immensely.  It's still uniquely Owl City's number, and fits its accompanying film well.","classification":5,"fold":7}
{"text":"I really love this song, I was an abused woman with 3 sons and the one thing I know they still feel is a desire to pay back their stepfather,not that they would because we live a christian life now. But the song really speaks to the long term ramifications of abuse. My precious son who was killed in a car accident 3\/10\/2013 once at the age of 12 had to put himself in a football stance and knock his stepdad off me because he was breaking my arm, so this was mine and my ons favorite song,because we survived it and went on to have abuse free lives, until he was killed in a car accident at age 36.

And in a world where half-hearted covers of Sinatra and others are common by half-hearted sell-outs trying to make a buck, Mr. Bubl&eacute; puts them all to shame. And it's not just his covers which are good, his originals are great too; \"Home\" was an awesome love song. However, this song seems to fall for the most part, flat. While Bubl&eacute;'s vocals are still as charming and brilliant as ever, the song itself could have been better. It's a simple song saying, you guessed it, you're my everything. Pretty darn simple to say the least. And while you could complain all day about how light and poppy the music sounds, I won't go into too much more depth than that.\n\nSo overall, not Bubl&eacute;'s best, and probably not even close. It's a light poppy tune, that keeps it very simple. Whether this is a good thing, or not, is up to you to decide, but this song isn't for people like me, who want a little bit more complexity and originality for our music.","classification":3,"fold":7}

And while Groban does have a good voice (it's more of a very mature acquired taste), his songs are boring, and inspirational. This song also sounds like the producer was heavily involved making this, rather than the artist. And due to the undue success of this song from saps who need a little lifting up, the inspirational genre is now a big sappy industry. And what's bad is, it has zero substance. Sure the lyrics, good gosh the lyrics, I mean, anybody can write these songs, but all the great ones don't because it's unoriginal. I mean if this song helps you, great. But for the rest of us that only care about great music, the song is only ok.\n\nOverall, if you're a sappy soccer mom who needs a little lifting and inspiration in your life, buy the song, otherwise, don't support this genre any longer.

(Which is kind of odd for an artist who wowed me with her song 3AM, but hey...what she does at 3 in the morning should in no way dictate what she should do in a bar. So good for her!)\n\nThe lyrics are clean.\n\nIt's got Meghan Trainor's normal sound to it. It's girl empowerment pop music, which is definitely her thing.

{"text":"5th album (first in nine years and the first one since 1998 with the original line-up) from this Chicago area band is packed with potent, classic female vocal led indie rock.  For me, Veruca Salt always fell in the same category as Smashing Pumpkins:  Everybody I know loved them and I thought they were just pretty good.  Well, either my taste has changed or they're better than I remember.  Ghost Notes is built with addictively expressive voices, strong melody lines, and solid, ripping rock guitars spitting out some viciously hummable power pop tunes.  The songs sparkle and roar with confidence and the kind of fun-but-muscular melodic density that is so often lacking in indie rock today.  There are no weak tracks here!  Recalls bands like Throwing Muses, The Breeders, Sleater-Kinney, Hole, L7.  It may not be a world-changer, but there is a fresh & vital feel to Ghost Notes that gives it a power I want to experience again and again.  Recommended.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"In what must feel as divisive as the day Bob Dylan plugged his electric guitar in at the Newport Folk Festival, Mumford and Sons put away all their acoustical instruments and  jack in the electrics. I don't see how this album could do anything but divide those fans who listened to \"Sigh No More\" and \"Babel,\" then come to this. \"Wilder Mind\" says so long to the banjos and hello to the amplifiers. Is this a good thing? How does the band deal with wanting to step into the shoes of U2?\n\nI don't think it's any secret that Mumford and Sons always wanted to sound big. After all, even with the acoustic guitars, the songs were often all about the bombast. Think of how potent \"Lover Of The Light\" or \"The Cave\" are, even behind the sound. They are anthems meant to shake the rafters. A friend of mine even referred to \"Babel\" as \"God and Bombast.\" Turning the amps up is kind of a natural progression for the band. But I still doubt anyone would have predicted the pounding that comes from \"The Wolf\" or \"Ditmas.\"\n\nWhat remains is Marcus Mumford's voice and his way around a lyric. The songs are credited to the entire band, which likely meant that each member designated his volume to the instrumentation, as the lyrics remain as soul searching as ever, and a little less on the God Quest side of things. And when the sonics aren't overwhelming, the songs sound as brightly as they might have on the band's earlier albums (\"Believe\" and \"Hot Gates\").\n\nThis may still come as a bitter pill to swallow for the fans expecting more of what the first two albums represent. I would suggest that you test the samples first or think about what U2 (or a heavier version of Coldplay) might sound like. The songs themselves are good enough for me to forgive the amplification, but \"Wilder Mind\" takes a little getting used to. Be prepared.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"After listening to this record, it's her  most safest work she has ever done by far. I wasn't too fascinated. In fact, I felt bored with most of the songs. Many of its uptempos didn't kept me on my feet like the ones on Bionic apart from Your Body, Shut Up, and Around The World. It felt like the fun and excitement were missing. I would say that Blank Page and Sing For Me easily outshine most of the tracks on Lotus.  I would place Lotus behind B2B, Bionic, and Stripped because I feel that it does sound a bit generic compared to the more experimental sounds on the predecessors.\n\nDo I think that Lotus is an improvement on Bionic? Heck no..not really.  I like how Bionic was less commercialized, very artistic, and experimental. Bionic sounded at least more distinctive and more inviting in sound. Sonically, it's far more interesting and fun than Lotus. It had alot more variety in sounds while Lotus sounds like something that could easily be done by Rihanna, Katy, or Britney. People think Lotus is better than Bionic. If generic music is their kind of thing, then ok. But people who have been following her since Stripped and with REAL musical tastes knows she could have done a LOT better than this and not playing it safe. I can't really say that Lotus is more cohesive because most of the tracks left me more to be desired. I wanted to get into the songs, but the beats just didn't feel all that mind blowing to me. None of the songs truly gave me that wow factor like her older albums. None of the songs even compare to AMAZING, stellar songs like Monday Morning or Bobblehead. Bobblehead is one of those tracks that make me want to do hopscotch or double dutch. Christina needs to leave that generic mess to the younger crowd and return to the formula that made her stand APART from the rest. It feels like Christina's input and vision have been considerably absent on this one. It feels it's been greatly compromised for the sake of staying relevant and current.  it's really sad that people would rather praise her most generic work (Lotus) than the more artistic, riskier one (Bionic) that sets itself apart from the rest. Of course, commercialism always sell more and gets more rave reviews.  I find it so ridiculous that it's even got a higher score on Stripped on metacritic. The reviewers were spot on that people would like the mix and style of Stripped and Bionic won't be turning heards with this one. I couldn't believe that Lotus actually got a higher score than Stripped and Bionic. Lotus is by far her most safest, generic work and it gets more praised. I find it to be her weakest effort. It really frustrates me how Bionic never got the success it deserves and less praises. It's her most riskiest work ever and nobody wants to salute her for that. For being unique and different. Love u, Xtina. But your creativity is slipping. I want Riskytina BACK! The one who was not afraid to experiment. Show me that freak side like you did on Bionic! And I miss her interludes. It made her stand out more from the rest. Like this person said, \"Say what you want about Bionic, the album had a powerful theme and overall vision both in her artwork and music, there was a connection and overall vibe. That is really missing from Lotus. It's like her artistry has been toned down by her people to help her sell but its just made it lacking. There's no interludes on this album which is classic Christina musically, there's no REAL or strong sense of musical themes because her label must have requested she go back to a safe formulas to sell. It's a random mix that does not work for me. There's no change of genre or change of image. I expected a very sensual and spiritual album, like the cover suggests \"  Team Bionic ALL THE WAY!\n\nI know I am being very critical and harsh, but I strongly feel that Christina is WAAAY better than this. She doesn't need to resort to this. I'm an Aquarius. I can't help it if I like something more unique and different from the rest. I know her self-worth and the wonderful, great artist that she's truly is. I am feel really disappointed with this era. It's a total setback from the true artist she had aspired to be from Stripped. Like another reviewer had mentioned, she promised her fans that would never do safe\/mainstream music. My...have the tables have turned. Hopefully, she makes it up to her devoted fans that were fans of her earlier work and returns to her OLD self. Because honestly this does not feel like a Christina album. The REAL Christina wouldn't resort to generic dance music and work with used up producers.  Overall, I would give Lotus 4\/5. I still think it's worth listening, just not worth remembering. Even though I haven't felt compelled to put this album on repeat like her earlier ones, I will still get Lotus though...just to support Christina and her sales. I have to admit that the cover and images in the booklet are very beautiful and subtle. It had some nice themes like self defense and keeping positive vibes, just wish the music itself live up to my expectations. I guess this is her own \"Charmbracelet\".\n\n1. Lotus- Probably the most experimental and unique track on the entire album.  One person mentioned that her vocals on this track are soft and heavenly and, like the Lotus Flower, this song slowing grows and eventually blooms. I couldn't agree more. Best intro since Stripped!  5\/5\n\n2. Army of Me- Wasn't really that crazy about this song at first. The sound is a little bland for my taste,  but it may be a nice follow up to Your Body. She makes references from her older song Fighter. \"One of me is wiser, one of me is stronger, one of me is a fighter\"  This song may grow on you.  4\/5\n\n3. Red Hot Kinda Love- Sounds like a reject from Bionic. It's good, but I would probably have put this as a bonus track. 4\/5\n\n4.  Make The World Move- I was really disappointed with this one when I heard it initially. I was ready to dismiss it as her weakest track on here, but it grew on me the more I listen to it. It can be a bit bland at times. Their other collaboration \"Nasty\" would have been a better choice for this album.  4.5\/5\n\n5. Your Body- Honestly, it starts to get better with this. Perhaps, the most strongest, catchiest one on this album.  I love her body, just not this album. The lyrics will make you want to hit that repeat button each time!  5\/5\n\n6. Let There Be Love- My mind screamed \"Girl Gone Wild\" as the song begins to start. Very generic, but it sounds radio friendly. 4\/5\n\n7. Sing For Me- The first ballad on the album.  Now she is really starting to grab my attention here. Things start to get mellow. Pretty empowering song. Love the 80s throwback.  This would make a nice single choice.  5\/5\n\n8. Blank Page- feels like You Lost Me pt. 2 with more strength. I could imagine this song being used on So You Think You Can Dance or being sung on shows like American Idol or The X Factor. 5\/5\n\n9. Cease Fire- The drum beats are the only ones that give this song its own saving grace, other than that it can feel boring at times. She sounds bored.  People say this song reminds them of Rihanna, but I don't hear it. 4\/5\n\n10. Around the World- I can picture Rihanna doing this song as well. Those were my immediate thoughts. This would also make a good single choice. If only they were more uptempos on this record that could sound this good as this one, but unfortunately only this song and Your Body caught my ears.  5\/5\n\n11. Circles-The fiestiest track of them all. It clearly goes out to her haters that won't back off.  5\/5\n\n12. Best Of Me- Have some good moments, but wish it could have been better. 4\/5\n\n13. Just A Fool-the only non-generic song on the album. Nice to see Christina dabbling into country. This will comfort any doubters who were a bit hesitant of her doing this kind of thing. I love how Christina can pull off any genre. 5\/5\n\n14. Light Up The Sky-Not my favorite, but it sounds very pleasant. 4\/5\n\n15. Empty Words- Decent song. Like it better than Light Up the Sky. 4\/5\n\n16. Shut Up-My favorite bonus track. I would add this song to the standard edition to spice things up cuz honestly this album feels boring. 5\/5\n\nI won't bother giving the remix a rating.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"THE BLUE RIDGE RANGERS RIDES AGAIN has quite a few flaws (starting with the tongue-twisting, grammar-defying title): much of the song selection is ho-hum (John Denver?  Really?); the arrangements are often uninspired (\"Never Ending Song of Love\" sounds just like every other country-tinged bluegrass love song); and even Fogerty himself tends to slack off a bit here and there.\n\nBut you should still listen to this album.  Why?  Because, despite its flaws, there are still a few career-defining moments here.  Fogerty's take on \"Haunted House\" is truly inspired; as is his collaboration with the Boss on \"When Will I Be Loved\" (talk about a final double-whammy).  His duet (can I call it that?) with Don Henley and Timothy Schmidt on \"Garden Party\" plays out like a sixties\/seventies country-rock wet dream (the Eagles and CCR collide; it's just as amazing as you would expect).\n\nThe problem is, Fogerty never really sounds like himself.  I have yet to hear the original BLUE RIDGE RANGERS album; it was on my shopping list at one point, but got knocked aside for whatever reasons.  I still intend to purchase it; John Fogerty is a musical icon, a true rock\/country legend who deserves every bit of respect (and, yes, disrespect) he's garnered.  But THE BLUE RIDGE RANGERS RIDES AGAIN just doesn't sound much like a Fogerty record; we get the lovable, happily-married guy on a few tracks, and he sounds genuinely blissful (bliss is boring, as the rock adage goes), but we don't get much of the angry rocker; he comes close on John Prine's \"Paradise,\" though he gives the tune a more up-tempo melody than it necessitates (check out Johnny Cash's PERSONAL FILE for a very haunting version of the tune).  Still, it's nice to hear Fogerty's take on the classic; and it's nice to hear his interpretations of all these songs.  The record is heavily flawed in spots, but when it shines, it's blinding.  If you're a fan of Fogerty or CCR, you need to pick up a copy of this album.  If you're new to the man, you might want to start elsewhere and work your way back here.","classification":3,"fold":7}

Yet, he has an undeniable presence and new era style to her music.\n\n  \"Summertime Sadness\" is the type of song that will take Lana from being a novelty singer, appealing only to a niche audience, to becoming a larger mainstream presence on this charts.

This album establishes the fact that the more a REAL MCee raps, the better the lyric becomes and when you add emotion and confidence you will become unstoppable. This is the best Cd that has ever come from her. The first single \"Bk Anthem\" jumped it off but in actuality it jumped off with that \"Bang, Bang\" flow. In which Lil kim was put in her place.

Having read a little about them I'm not surprised to find out that they are an alternative band formed in the late 90's. \"C'mon, C'mon\" has all the features that attract me to alternative music (I do not claim to be an music expert and many times I do not follow bands, I simply go by what I like and my own interpretations of the music--if you listen long enough you're able to identify the rock, punk, and even some 70's sounds in  many songs that are considered or identified as alternative). For me at least, the influence of good old fashioned well known punk bands, like the Clash and American punk like the Ramones is clear even in \"C'mon, C'mon\"--probably one of the reasons why I liked it and bought it.\n\nI did not know that \"C'mon C'mon\" was used as the opening music for the TV show \"Rescue Me\" but this is besides the point. I have no idea what the lyrics mean and are beyond the scope of my review. However, they're simple enough, I've caught myself singing to this song and I usually don't sing. I love that anthem sound that is so particular of alternative music (also punk, yes?). In some crazy way, it reminds me of the Clash's \"Police on my back.\" Crazy, but that's what it reminds me of.\n\nI've given \"C'mon C'mon\" five stars because I'm very happy with my purchase.

{"text":"Written before Daughtry left for American Idol semi-superstardom, this song was also used for the actual show, and made for the best goodbye song yet. Although the song has lost a little of its luster after going through the ugly radio cycle, the song still remains as good as ever with its touching lyrics, perfect vocals, great structure, and its build-up during the course of the song. In fact, the only thing that could top this song, is its acoustic version, which I believe was distributed by Wal-Mart. It perfects the song in amazing ways, and makes the song a real stunner with new depths of emotion. That version was quickly added to my long list of best songs of all time.\n\nSo overall, Daughtry's best song, and it deserves all its praise. Try to get the acoustic version if you can, but either way, its a great song that'll always be remembered for American Idol.","classification":5,"fold":7}

I think is it a perfect intro to a great singer.  Her voice is so distinct that it can never be copied, and her styling and phrasing is deep.  \"In the Dark\" & \"I Want a Little Sugar in My Bowl,\" are absolute gems, but the CD overall is excellent.  My only complaint is the measly 38 minutes, I think there could have been more songs added, but other than that it's a good CD for starters.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Ghostface Killah has been consistent in the two decades of his career. His body of work has rivaled many in the music industry- even if at times the sales didn't match the acclaim. He made a lasting impression on Wu-Tang Clan's debut \"Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)\". He took things a step further by appearing on another classic album- this time on half the songs on Raekwon's \"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...\". His time came in 1996 with his Gold selling RZA produced debut \"Ironman\", which featured the singles \"Daytona 500\" and the personal song about living in poverty \"All That I Got Is You\". After a four year wait- mostly due to constant pushbacks- he released his long awaited sophomore effort \"Supreme Clientele\". He followed it up with his third and final album for Epic Records- 2001's \"Bulletproof Wallets\". By 2004, he ended up on Def Jam- where he would put out a lot of material but some of the albums never got the attention they deserved (See: \"The Pretty Toney Album\" and it's predecessor \"Fishscale\"). He issued the disappointing \"The Big Doe Rehab\", followed by his long talked about R&B album \"Ghostdini: Wizard Of Poetry In Emerald City\". His final album for Def Jam, 2010's \"Apollo Kids\" was well received, despite the little to no promotion from the label.\n\nIn 2012, he signed with The RZA's independent label Soul Temple Entertainment. He made his debut on the label on the soundtrack to the martial arts film \"The Man With The Iron Fists\"- a film directed by The RZA and executive produced by Quentin Tarantino. His first project under Soul Temple was the concept album \"Twelve Reasons To Die\". The album was produced solely by Adrian Younge, who also produced the soundtrack to the blaxploitation parody \"Black Dynamite\". From there, they created an album that was based around the comic book also called \"Twelve Reasons To Die\". While it is a hip hop album, the production is deep rooted in early 1970's northern soul. He works with several members of the Wu-Tang family, such as Inspectah Deck on the song \"Blood On The Cobblestones\" as well as \"An Unexpected Call (The Set Up)\". Masta Ace appears twice also- first on \"I Declare War\" and again on \"Revenge Is Sweet\". He teams up with half of Wu-Tang Clan on the song \"Murder Spree\", although his onetime rhyming partner Raekwon is noticeably absent. After sampling a song by The Delfonics on his 2004's \"The Pretty Toney Album\", lead singer William Hart returns the favor on the sinister \"Enemies All Around Me\". Lastly, Ghostface gets help from Cappadonna on the ballad about an untrustworthy woman \"The Center Of Attraction\". \"Twelve Reasons To Die\" is a soiid recording from Ghostface Killah. While it's not as strong as his earlier works, it's definitely one to add to the catalogue.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Untethered Moon is a fantastic return for Built to Spill. This album is an instant classic filled with everything that makes Built to Spill a great band. The scorching guitar riffs and solo in opening track All Our Songs represent some of the best musicianship the band has ever laid down on a studio album. Fortunately, the album doesnt peak with this incredible first song.\n\nUntethered Moon is a strong effort throughout, rivaling some of the best work in Built to Spills catalog. All Our Songs, C.R.E.B, and When Im Blind are some of the strongest tracks, but the entire album is outstanding. This is a guitar-driven album with blaring riffs that will rip through your speakers. Its not necessarily groundbreaking in that it doesnt explore too much new territory for the band, but there are still plenty of fresh sounds that will make you glad Built to Spill is still making music. I think its their best work since Keep It Like a Secret. Lets hope it doesnt take so long to get the next one.","classification":5,"fold":7}
{"text":"Admittedly I'm biased towards this collection of songs.  I've been a Jeff Tweedy fan since I first heard the Uncle Tupelo album Anodyne many years ago (wish I had discovered them before their last disc but oh well!).  I loved the Jay Bennett era Wilco stuff when it came out, and even more the first two albums after that (A Ghost Is Born and Sky Blue Sky are probably my favorites).  I've also followed Tweedy's work with side projects like Golden Smog (Weird Tales is a top-ten album for me) and Loose Fur (with famed indie sonic experimentalist Jim O'Rourke).\n\nThis album is full of moments that draw from all of these periods, although it reminds me most of Sky Blue Sky and, at times, Loose Fur.  It's mostly subdued and strummy, but with a clear production style that feels a lot like Sky Blue Sky.  Some of these songs kick up the tempo (World Away is my favorite of these so far) but most are happy to march along at a steady pace (Low Key is my favorite of this type of song). Jeff Tweedy always seems most comfortable sharing the spotlight with other talented players, and it's very cool that he gives his son so much room to carry the proceedings. It's often the rhythm that propels these songs along, and Junior proves himself to be an excellent percussionist who knows how to bring out the best in dad.\n\nThis album is a subtle charmer full of rich melodies, intricate rhythms and intimately confounding lyrics.  It sounds fantastic on first listen but reveals greater and greater depth with subsequent hearings.  I don't give out 5 star reviews lightly these days, but this album certainly deserves it.  This is easily my favorite set of songs I've heard from Jeff Tweedy since Sky Blue Sky.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"The main selling point here is the cult-classic set of Ren Leibowitz's nine Symphonies of Beethoven, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Leibowitz's accounts were recorded for Readers Digest Classical Collection in 1961-62 using the acoustically excellent Walthamstow Town Hall in London, under producer Charles Gerhardt and legendary Decca Sound Engineer Kenneth Wilkinson. Leibowitz was an extremely talented but relatively unsung conductor. I'd never previously heard the set, but my rummaging around on the web suggests that it has been prized by connossiers for many years in various LP & CD versions--and with good reason.\nI'd been impressed with anything I else ever heard by Leibowitz, so when this popped up for really cheap, I had to grab it. The sound is quite good for its era, and the pace is always brisk and intense without losing lyricism. Up to now, I've listened to Symphonies 3, 5, 6, 7 & 8 and all are in my mind really impressive. I'm looking forward to hearing the others, and the other material in the collection. The sound is bright and vivid, with plenty of impact--and this suits the VERY energetic performance style. Sometimes in really loud passages there's a wee bit of overload, but I'll take that over a muffled sounding recording.\n\nThis would be a very good starter set of the Symphonies for beginning collectors who don't already have one, but it will also provide a fresh way for jaded collectors to hear these wonderful but perhaps overfamiliar warhorses .\n\nA couple of points: 1) In general, these versions are very fast (in a good way--they're energetic and clearly articulated without being rushed). Just for a little context, Leibowitz takes the first movement of the Eroica in 12:34. Toscanini takes 13:46. Munch takes 13:59. Karajan ('63) takes 14:44. Krips takes 14:50. Klemperer takes 16:41. Leibowitz has the late Sir Thomas Beecham's Royal Philharmonic in its prime playing full out and the recordings are anything but routine. Even if you have many versions of the 9, you might be hearing an approach to the symphonies that you haven't heard before.\n2) There's a sense of unfolding drama. I was listening to the 5th for the first time this morning and my college-senior son (a classical music fan who lives at home) wandered into my home office. He immediately volunteered, \"This is a really good performance!\" Then he sat down and we listened to the whole symphony together. Now please excuse the rest of the anecdote, but about 3 minutes from the end of the Finale, my son mentioned, \"Gee, I need to go to the bathroom, but I need to hear how this turns out.\" So we listened to the ending, talked about the impact of the coda, and then he headed off to the facilities. He could have asked me to pause the recording, but he didn't want to let go of the experience.\n\nThe Beethoven sonatas I've listened to so far by O'Reily are not bad. I haven't listened to the other performances, but the Leibowitz versions of the symphonies alone would be worth your $1.09. Given how good they these, I'm not really worried about the duplications in tracks 89-99. Based on similar issues with other mp3 sets, I do sometimes wonder if the folks who assemble these compliations have any idea what they're doing, but in this case we've lucked out with a rare and really cool set of the Symphonies--and more!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I was able to listen to the the first time it was made available on tunelinks, without anyone telling me it was a classic 5 minutes after it's release, and without anyone telling me it was trash. It made for a very good listen. I'm not a Drake fan, but he knows how to craft some good songs, and i would have to put IYRTITL as probably his second best release behind Take Care. The production is fairly dark, with a handful of lively beat thrown in to break up any possible monotony. Drake is a decent rapper and a decent singer, but a very good artist overall, and makes for a really good product. This album may be long, but it doesn't really feel that way upon listening. My favorite tracks are Madonna, Legend, Know Yourself, and No Tellin', all on the first half of the album. 6PM In New York, 10 Bands, and Company with Travis Scott (one of only a handful of features) are notable songs too. A lot of nice samples used throughout as well.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Q-Tip returned in 2008 with \"The Renaissance\", his first album in nine years. This album had been in the making since 2005, under it's original titles \"Open\" and \"Live At The Renaissance\". Two songs were released in that time, \"Work It Out\" and \"The Fever\"- neither of which made it on the album, but the official first single \"Gettin' Up\" did. It starts off with \"Johnny Is Dead\" and leads into \"Won't Trade\" which isn't a bad song, but is the weakest compared to the rest of the album. Later on in the album is the song \"You\" in which Q-Tip confronts a woman over her infidelity. The long absent D'Angelo appears on the inspirational tune \"Believe\" and the closer \"Shaka\" touches on the deceased, including his former manager Shaka, jazz musician Weldon Irvine and the late J. Dilla, who produced the only song that Q-Tip didn't- the rather brief \"Move\". \"The Renaissance\" has only twelve songs, but all of them are worthy of listening to from start to finish. This record will not disappoint.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"3.5 Stars...decent but didn't knock my socks off.\n\nMy Morning Jacket's album At Dawn quickly became a favorite for me when I bought it back around 2002.  At the time I was very much enamored with the so-called alt-country sound, artists like Wilco, Old 97s, Lucinda Williams, Whiskeytown, Steve Earle, etc. (I still love all those artists).  MMJ provided a unique spin on that loose genre, with an echoey style reminiscent of Daniel Lanois's production on albums by artists like Robbie Robertson and Emmylou Harris.  The rich texture of the sound is what brought me to the table, but the strength of the songs and feelings with which they were imbued is what made me stay.  To this day At Dawn is one of my favorites, as is the follow-up album It Still Moves.  I remember seeing MMJ perform around this period, when they were making peanut butter sandwiches for the audience (or at least those in the front row) and giving away free concert tickets with album purchase at the local indie record store (wow things have changed).  They had fire and grit, clearly ready for a bigger stage than they were on.\n\nSo here I am four albums later (and quite a bit older) listening to The Waterfall.  In the interim, MMJ has branched out a lot.  First came the very modern-sounding Z, which began to shed the grain-silo-alt-countryish sound for something more slick and progressive.  I really liked that album, perhaps not as much as At Dawn but still quite a lot.  The songs were strong and anthemic, with the beautiful 10-minute sweeping epic called Dondante (at the time a concert staple) closing the album.  After that came Evil Urges, a bit of a schizophrenic effort which didn't fully cohere but nicely showcased the band's restless nature and refusal to be pigeonholed.  Again I didn't love it but I liked it quite a bit.  With the follow-up Circuital, MMJ moved away from the overt experimentalism of Evil Urges but kept searching for new sounds.  At the time it was released, I liked it about as much as Z.  However, the songs didn't really stick with me nearly as much over time.  By now we were clearly pretty far from the early days.\n\nI had read some reviews for The Waterfall which touted the album as something of a return to the band's roots.  Given my inability to fully warm up to Circuital, I wasn't so sure.  But I gave it a chance.  To start with the positive, this one certainly has strong moments.  The catchy \"Compound Fracture\" is one of the best songs I have heard from this band, and \"Get To The Point\" is a clever song which sounds very connected to the band's roots.  \"Big Decisions\" is interesting and lyrically more challenging than much of the band's prior work as well, which opens up a new facet of their style.  I also found myself really enjoying the mystical \"Tropics (Erase Traces)\" quite a lot.  I think this is my favorite track on the album and for me successfully captures a lot of what makes MMJ great.  It's simply spellbinding.  However, the rest of the album just doesn't do it for me.  The opening track sounds like generic arena-ready anthem rock designed to appeal to the masses.  Beyond that there's just a lot of meandering mid-tempo experimentalism which to me isn't very interesting or memorable.  What's missing is the (Tennessee) fire and grit I remember from the early years.  Ultimately the whole experience didn't cohere and just fell flat for me.  I downloaded the songs I liked and left it at that.\n\nI certainly can't fault this band for trying to keep their sound fresh and pushing in new directions.  It would have been all too easy to keep making At Dawn and It Still Moves over and over, touring with bands like Band of Horses which have pretty much built entire careers from imitating that sound.  What separates The Waterfall from the far more engaging Evil Urges and Z is the general dullness of about half of this material.  Maybe I am just missing it.  Maybe I should keep trying.  But to me, this album doesn't represent a return to roots at all.  It's another new direction, but one which doesn't fully deliver on this great band's promise.  Again, just my opinion, please give it a listen and see what YOU think!","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"When Weezer released Everything Will Be Alright in the End back in 2014, I know I wasn't the only fan who breathed a massive sigh of relief. After years of puzzling, strange and (in some cases) downright embarrassing albums, it seemed they had finally found their footing again and were ready to reclaim their place as one of the best pop\/rock bands out there. While I was thrilled with that record, it also caused me a bit of trepidation. Was it a fluke? Could Weezer really remain consistent and maintain their winning streak? With the White Album, the band's fourth self-titled release, it's safe to say that my fears have been put to rest. Weezer is officially back---and this time they're bringing summer with them.\n\nRight off the bat we're treated to \"California Kids\", complete with big guitars, driving drums and those Weezer melodies we've come to know and love so well. The Beach Boys are a major influence on this LP and you'll hear it in several tracks, most notably \"Wind in Our Sail\" and \"(Girl We Got A) Good Thing\", which floats so effortlessly into your ears that you can't help but smile and sing along. Other tunes like \"King of the World\" and \"Summertime Elaine and Drunk Dori\" are slices of vintage Weezer, taking you on a catchy ride in about three minutes. Despite its stupid title, \"L.A. Girlz\" manages to deliver the bright pop power we've come to know and love from the band.\n\nThere's also some subtle experimentation thrown in, albeit in very conservative measures. The dark and brooding \"Do You Wanna Get High?\" is a standout, its ominous chords building an atmosphere that Make Believe's \"We Are All on Drugs\" desperately needed. It feels like a Pinkerton b-side and that alone puts it near the top of my list. \"Jacked Up\" is driven by a bouncy piano and quirky melody that gets better with every listen. The pensive, building closer \"Endless Bummer\" is beautiful, with only \"Thank God for Girls\" being the album's weak spot. It's not terrible but lyrically it feels way too silly and forced to be much more than a curiosity. Cuomo's lyrics aren't as strong here as they were on the previous album, though they're still far better what what we got on albums like Raditude and Hurley.\n\nAs the weather warms up and the flowers bloom, it's wonderful to have a new Weezer album as the soundtrack. It's a perfect companion to their previous colored records and a bright sign that Weezer truly has returned to form. Those of us in the mid-west probably won't see a beach this summer...thankfully Weezer is back to help dull that pain","classification":5,"fold":7}

Should appeal to fans and followers of MGMT, Comets On Fire, Syd Arthur and possibly White Denim or Spacemen 3. Nonetheless, a great lo-fi psychedelic piece.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"There is something about Rucker's voice that I just can't get enough of.  He's so smooth and the way he carries a chorus is unlike any other.  I remember when Hootie and the Blowfish was striking gold with `Cracked Read View', singles like `Hold My Hand' and `Only Wanna Be With You' hitting the radios and staying for countless spins.  I also remember thinking that something just wasn't right about it all.  It was good, but it felt like something was amiss.  Then Rucker went solo and switched gears to the country side of things and it all made sense.  Rucker, the frontman for Hootie, just wasn't feeling it.  Now he is, and it shows.\n\n`Charleston, SC 1966' contains a slew of great ballads as well as some uptempo numbers that show Rucker's complete grip on the genre.  I personally gravitate towards his ballads since his voice has such a smooth baritone that is complimented by those tones, but he nails some of the catchier tracks, which is shown on the success of singles like `This' and `Come Back Song'.  For me, `I Got Nothin' and `Things I've Never Do' dominate this album, showing vulnerability and honesty in his commiseration over failing relationships.\n\nHe can't avoid the stereotypical `country' pitfalls entirely though.  A common issue with country albums is the clich&eacute;d and generalized `storytelling'.  This problem even runs into the songs I really love, but his charisma and vocal quality help keep them afloat.  Still, `Love Will Do That', `Might Get Lucky' and `I Don't Care' ride that line of `anyone could have sung this song' and I hate it when a track feels like a throwaway.  I want my artists to connect to the material and not just grab songs from a list.  Sadly, as a whole this album just doesn't try to do anything.  It is a very safe album, and while some of the songs are beautifully done, none of them (even the ones I love) are noteworthy for their creativity or originality.  They don't really say anything that isn't generalized in many other country songs floating out there, and in a sea that vast you really need to try and differentiate yourself.\n\nStill, Rucker manages to hold this album together for the most part, giving us a glimpse at where his heart is at.  He loves this music and you can feel that in his voice.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"RIDE THE LIGHTENING, Metallica's second album, is notable for its musical direction, combining thrash metal with more symphonic, and much more complex, songwriting than previously seen in metal music.\n\nWhen Metallica recorded their debut,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Kill-Em-All\/dp\/B000002H5E\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kill 'Em All<\/a>, the record was brutal, fast, and noholds barred.  The music barrels ahead, and there isn't nearly as many different instrumental subtetlies and flourishes that Metallica would later use to adorn their music with.  Instead, the focus was to play the music as loud, and as fast, as humanly possible.  They sounded rather like their contemporaries in drawing from the same overall musical milieu.  A lot of bands from NWOBHM (\"New Wave of British Heavy Metal\") were covering a lot of the same territory, such as Black Sabbath, Diamond Head, Iron Maiden, Venom, Motorhead, early Def Leppard (think&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/On-Through-the-Night\/dp\/B000001F7R\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">On Through the Night<\/a>, their 1980 album, not their hair metal stuff), Saxon and other bands considered part of that movement..\n\nBeginning with this record, and culminating in ... AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, Metallica changed their approach.  Still retaining the aggression and attitude of punk, mixed with the loud, bone-crunching amalgamation heavy metal sound popularized the major bands of NWOBHM then put in progressive songwriting that owes as much to classical music as pop or rock or traditional heavy metal, and you have a good idea of what RIDE THE LIGTHENING,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Master-of-Puppets\/dp\/B000002H33\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Master of Puppets<\/a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/And-Justice-For-All\/dp\/B000002H6C\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">...And Justice For All<\/a>&nbsp;sounds like.  Those three records are what I call their progressive metal trilogy; with each album their song writing got more complex and more symphonic.\n\nAs much as I like KILL `EM ALL, this is the album in which Metallica really comes into their own.  While KILL `EM ALL has some very strong songwriting, they don't display the same complexity and melodic integrity as they do on this record. All over we see Metallica opening their sound up.\n\n\"Fire with Fire\": The soft intro to \"Battery\" from MASTER feels like a nod to the great acoustic intro to the opening track, \"Fire for Fire\".  After the mellow intro, the band kicks the song into high gear.  This shift is clear evidence the band is mastering different dynamics and integrating shifting tempos into a coherent song structure, and they're not just brutally fast like KILL `EM ALL.\n\n\"Ride the Lightening\" is one of Metallica's more epic compositions.  Lyrically the song sets up themes of being powerless in a hostile situation, a theme Hetfield would often return too.\n\n\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" deals with the futility of war, another theme the and would revisit on both MASTER and JUSTICE, and is titled after the Earnest Hemingway novel.  One of the band's more famous early songs.  The intro is pretty long, at over two minutes before Hetfield starts singing.\n\n\"Fade to Black\" is notable as it is the first ballad ever commercially released by the band.  [Just because they were labeled sell outs during the load era doesn't mean it diddn't happen fore then.]  Those people who hate LOAD and RELOAD should take note that accusations that Metallica sold out first surfaced with this very song, due to how much of a departure this was for the band's clearly established sound.  Now, however, most fans and critics, as well as the band itself, considered this one of Metallica's great songs.  The song is very much a study in dynamics, and while it is primarily a slower ballad, Metallica works in some heavy passages in the song as well.  The song deals mainly with death, and is considered a \"suicide classic\".  This is one of Metallica's most important songs, as it showed the band's fan base there was a lot more to the band than just mind numbingly fast thrash.\n\n\"Trapped Under Ice\" has some killer chorus work and interesting lyrics.  Musically it's very solid as well.  The song has some absolutely intense guitar work.  Probably the second weakest song though, next to \"Escape.\"  Metallica has only performed the song four times live.\n\n\"Escape\" is one of the few songs the band has never played live.  Written as filler because they didn't have enough songs for the album, the band has pretty much disavowed the song.  While I don't know why the band hates it that much, it is true that this is easily the weakest song on the entire album, though not necessarily bad par se.  It's just the other songs are that good.\n\n\"Creeping Death\", written from the point of view of the angel of death coming to kill all the first born in Egypt, remains one of the band's principal early epics, and is still one of their most frequently played songs.  Drawing their inspiration from the movie THE TEND COMMANDMENTS, Cliff Burton made the observation that the plague of the first born was like creeping death, and the band wanted to use it for a title they liked it so much.  One of the band's most famous of their early songs, this one's an undeniable thrash classic.\n\nAnd last, but definitely not least, is \"The Call of Ktula\".  The second instrumental released by the band (after Anethestia, Pulling Teeth from KILL `EM ALL), this is the last song primarily written by David Mustaine of Megadeath fame that Metallica would record. Originally entitled \"When Hell Freezes Over\", Cliff Burton had the song renamed, because he was a H. P. Lovecraft fan and was referencing THE CALL OF CTHULHU.  Megadeath actually uses the chords for their song \"Hanger 18\". Discounting the two covers \"Tuesday's Gone\" and \"Mercyful Fate\" it's the band's fourth longest recording, and the longest song on RIDE THE LIGHTENING.  For my money, this is one of my favorite Metallica songs, and when I really started listening to this album in the late 1990s, this was the song I would play over and over.  It's much better than MASTER's instrumental \"Orion\".  Absolutely brilliant, even if Mustaine did write it.\n\nOverall, this is the album that would set Metallica on the artistic path they would follow for the rest of the 1980s.  This is the album they became truly progressive.  If it weren't for \"Escape\", this could arguably be one of their top albums; as it stands, this is still one of Metallica's best records, just only slightly flawed for the inclusion of \"Escape\".  And it's important that while hair metal and spandex were giving metal a bad name, bands like Metallica and Iron Maiden were still keeping the hardcore music close to its roots.  Hair metal and glam\/pop is rather dated.  It's too Metallica's credit that their albums stand up as well as they do and aren't dated at all, given they were, recorded in that same era of Def Leppard, Poison (damn Brett Michaels), Ratt, Slaughter, Warrant, Stryper, Europe, Journey, and other rather ridiculous bands were doing commercial hair metal and power ballads.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"When I first spun this set, I liked several of the tracks a lot, but thought it might be an average disc.  \"What You're Doin' to Me\" has a great urgency with a driving beat.  T-Bone Burnett penned \"Shakin' Shakin' Shakes.\"  It was the first track in personal top ten rotation with its flat-out rock riff and Bonnie's vocals strong and rich, \"And Lord, it makes me tremble.\"  \"If You Need Somebody\" has such a great backbeat with Ricky Faataar's drums and percussion rich and pounding.  As I spin the disc more and let the music sink in, I'm warming to more and more tracks.  The opener, \"The Unintended Consequences of Love\" has such a funky feeling with Bonnie's unadorned vocals cutting to the bone, \"I'm calling on you, baby, now or never; Let's dig in deep & get out of this rut; Well get back to what brought us both together, baby & find a way to resurrect our strut.\"  Michael Hutchence, known as the frontman for the 80s band INXS, penned \"Need You Tonight.\"  The track doesn't overpower but drives addictively, \"Slide over here & give me a moment; Your moves are so raw, I've got to let you know you're one of my kind.\"  Pat McLaughlin had a string of Americana albums in the 80s that had me waiting for each new release.  On Bonnie's new set, she pulls his song \"I Knew\" which slows the pace and lets the soulful Raitt vocals shine, \"There ain't no telling what you'll find in the corner of a darkened room.\"  \"Gypsy in Me\" bounces joyfully, a great road song.  Raitt is in strong form on this set.  Enjoy!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Matthew Wilder is an American musician, composer and record producer best known for his 1984 smash single \"Break My Stride\".  During the 1970's Wilder was one-half of the Greenwich Village folk group Matthew & Peter.  Then in 1978 he made the move to Los Angeles to follow his dream. Wilder found work as a backing vocalist for both Rickie Lee Jones and Bette Midler. Towards the end of 1983 Wilder released his debut album \"I Don't Speak the Language\".  The first single from that album was that bouncy little number \"Break My Stride\".  The song was a Top 10 hit not only in America but also in the UK, Ireland, South Africa, Germany, New Zealand, Austria, Sweden, Belgium and Denmark.

{"text":"Lewis Black's third album, Rules of Enragement, is his first release where his material really became more political. Keeping with tradition, Lewis starts out his show by busting on the city he's performing in. This time around he busts on Minnesota and his bit on their cold weather is hysterical. As usual, he's spot on when it comes to tackling issues like greed in big business and society's obsession with health. In particular, his commentary on milk and water are very funny. However, the end of the album is dominated by his views on Iraq. While his commentary is accurate, it does tend to drag at times. All told, Rules of Enragement is a very good album even if it tends to be too political near the end.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Lake Street Dive's move to a major label (Nonsuch, part of the Warner Bros. family) bears both the blessings and pitfalls of the move.  The production seems more homogeneous.  The instrumentation doesn't pop as much for me.  I kept playing the disc over to see if my difficulty getting into the disc was just because it's new; but I think here the instrumentation is treated more like background session players rather than more of a jazz-flavored soloist.  On the great song, \"I Don't Care About You,\" there is a great bass line.  Rather than letting it rip, it gets submerged into the background until it ends the track.  \"So Long\"  slows the pace in the middle of the set with a lovely vocal by Rachel Price.  The title track bops deliciously, \"We're having fun and we're keeping it flirty; Everybody might say that it's dirty, but don't you worry.\"  \"Mistakes\" swaggers like a jazz torch track with trumpet by McDuck playing off Rachel's vocals.  The set concludes with \"Saving All My Sinning\" that bounces and pops, with the drums unfortunately submerged in the mix.  \"Side Pony\" is a strong set with great songwriting.  While \"Side Pony\" may not be their best recording, it's a really good one!  Enjoy!","classification":4,"fold":7}

She honestly has not found better for her own work. When she made waves by pulling out a surprise album, it might have been good for some, but honestly the result was a complete waste of time, and a waste of her own voice. Partition is one of those songs that has been sincerely annoying. She really didn't bring a lot of drive into the song, just weakened her own heart. I really found this song to be a complete waste of time. Beyonce' does not have any chemistry to play seduction onto Jay-Z, she just makes the listener say, \" Why Do I Even Bother With Her?\" Overall, if you a new fan of Beyonce's music, go back to her early work with Crazy In Love, because her best in not even here.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":7}

{"text":"Prime Cuts:  Belongs to You, All the Time in the World, Just Look at You\n\nWayne has left his mark as a storyteller-singer: who could forget Wayne's passionate meliorism coming alive in the tale of an abused child finding hope through the altruistic love of a stranger in his hit \"Paper Angels\"?  Or how can one's heart not be dashed when listening to Wayne's \"Blue and Brown\" which tells of a policeman having to imprison his own brother?  Such heart slashing stuff dissipated with Wayne's sophomore album \"Do You Believe Me Now?\" \"Do You Believe Me Now?\" sadly fell into the cracks of bombastic commercialism where most of the track lacked threadbares of intricate heart woven tapestry.  Now album number three \"Sara Smile\" is a vast improvement--though still not on par with his meritorious debut--it has more heartfelt moments balanced with a few run of the mill radio treats.  Perhaps such improvements is due to the tight control of songs--instead of giving us a truckload of fillers, Waye has narrowed down to the traditional sacrosanct number of 10.  However, what is avant-garde (at least in country music) is that Wayne has enlisted not one but three producers:  all of whom are dignitaries--Nathan Chapman (Taylor Swift and Sara Evans), Mark Bright (Carrie Underwood and Reba McEntire) and Dann Huff (Martina McBride and Keith Urban).\n\nConsistent to Wayne's canon of songs, the ballads are hands down the winners here.  Though the theme of heartbreak has been part of country music's repertoire since its genesis, when Wayne sings Steve Robison and Hillary Lindsey's \"All the Time in the World\" he brings right us into the story as the protagonist re-visits the rendezvous he used to meet with his old flame.  \"Belongs to You,\" is a all out power ballad in the tradition of Rascal Flatts that showcases Wayne's endearing and high soaring tenor.  Unlike his debut, there is only one message song (those that belong to the \"Soup for the Soul\" collection), this time it's the sober \"Elephant Ears.\"  \"Elephant Ears\" is a narrative song that details the touching story of an adopted child struggling to say \"I love you.\"  This is inspirational stuff at its most affecting best.  \"Just Look at You\" ought to swoon the romantic right off their feet:  earnest, elegant and all so beautiful; this is destined to be a future Valentine's Day staple.\n\nThe title cut \"Sara Smile,\" for those who did not grow up in the 70s, is a cover of a Hall and Oates' smash.  Reverentially keeping close to the original, Wayne's version adds little to the duo's version, though fiddles and steel are added in to curry radio's favour.  Nevertheless, its catchy melody and well constructed melody are worth introducing to today's younger generation.  It doesn't take a prophet to foresee that \"Things I Believe In\" will be a mammoth hit. Written by Keith Urban and John Shanks, \"Things I Believe\" bears all the finger marks of Keith Urban.  From its feisty banjo flicks, to its breezy rock groove, to Wayne's Urban-like falsetto, it is almost as if this is Wayne being a guest vocalist on Urban's track.  \"That's A Memory,\" on the other hand, is one of those obligatory rocks with an anthem rock climax and rousing guitars.\n\nWayne has certainly climbed out of his sophomore slum as \"Sara Smile\" is a much better album in terms of a stronger material and more investment by Wayne in the lyrical depth and emotional levels.  However, it still doesn't hold a candle to his stellar debut.  Alas, ballad fans who are looking for sonic decadence to indulge in will find plenty to put smiles on your faces.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Dale Watson has always been a country music militant. But as he's aged, he's moved away from explicit railing against the modern country music establishment, choosing instead to show them up by crafting songs that are more country than \"country.\" Of course, there's some irony in Watson's embrace of an era that was scorned by then-contemporary critics who felt Nashville had irrevocably compromised the hillbilly roots of earlier times with the introduction of electric guitars and drums. But one can easily trace the DNA shared by the Carter Family, Merle Haggard and Dale Watson, while many of Nashville's modern radio stars seem to have grown from the Petri dish of arena rock. The music that Watson idolizes, and the place from which he composes, grew from the same roots, even as electric instruments were introduced and pedals were added to the steel guitars.\n\nHis latest album draws directly upon the golden age by featuring Lloyd Green (steel guitar), Hargus \"Pig\" Robbins (piano) and Pete Wade (guitar) as instrumentalists, with the Carol Lee Cooper Singers (led by the daughter of legends Wilma Lee and Stoney Cooper) adding deft countrypolitan touches in the background. Watson's baritone is less strident than in his earlier days, showing his love of country songs with his vocal caress rather than with lyrical barbs. He shuffles with the swinging glide of Ray Price, tenderly holding a lover, switching to the bottle's embrace when left behind, and finally counseling the cheaters of the world \"How to Break Your Own Heart.\"\n\nThe album's title track borrows the rolling rhythm of \"Gentle on My Mind,\" but its self-assessment of an aging party boy charts a future without John Hartford's wistful memories. Robbins' piano and Green's steel underline the emotions as Watson's songs wallow in romantic misery, moon over absent mates, and celebrate being in love. The album's one moment of modern-Nashville-inspired enmity is the closing \"Hello, I'm an Old Country Song.\" But here the words are filled with sorrow rather than barbs, more nostalgic and resigned than ready to pick a fight. Still, as long as Waston is writing and singing, he keeps the flame of his beloved country sounds vital, and that's truly the best rebuttal of all.

{"text":"This was Leonard Cohen's first album in 9 years after a stay in a Zen monastery.  It feels like he's never been away.  This is another great work by Mr. Cohen, sad, depressing, uplifiting, haunting, and moving.  Some have complained about the spare instrumentation (mostly a synclavier\/computer performed by Sharon Robinson, who co-wrote all the songs here with Leonard), but I think it works very well.  It's simple and straightforward, and it really enhances the sad, Scotch drenched lyrics.  A Thousand Kisses Deep is my favorite here, along with Alexandra Leaving (a great title to a great song), and By the Rivers Dark.  This isn't my favorite Cohen album (that's The Future), but this is probably the 2nd most played album in my Cohen collection.  I hope that Mr. Cohen doesn't go away for 9 years again.  Everyone missed him.  But it's amazing that despite the fact he was gone for so long, he didn't miss a beat.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Even on a less personal note, \"Still Crazy After All These Years\" remains incredibly poignant as Paul sings of two former lovers who meet by chance and how the man feels unhappy and unsatisfied with the way his life is going, \"Longing (his) life away.\" The beautiful music fits in so well with Paul's vocals and the modulations between major and minor keys work wonders for this masterpiece.\n\nI highly recommend this classic piece by Paul Simon.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Brandy returns with her 5th studio album and her first in over 4 years, \"Human\". Her last CD, \"Afrodisiac\" may have been her smallest seller (Gold certification) but it's my favourite brandy CD, mature and fab with production by Timbaland and Kanye West.  \"Human\", as its name implies, is filled with lyrics showing her humanity; contrition, vulnerability, life and love.\n\nHer new disc kicks off after a brief and rather kindergarten (in my opinion) definition of what being a human being means to her, leading into the upbeat \"The definition\" (the definition of love\/is you), which is followed by the piano-tinkled \"Warm it up (with love)\" and lead-off single \"Right here (Departed)\". The trio are produced by Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins and while pleasant, sound rather dated and like cast-offs from her 2002 Darkchild produced \"Full moon\" album. \"Piano man\" with its jittery techno strings and laid back groove sounds very much like Timbaland (\"2 man show\" from Timbaland's \"Shock value\" CD). It is actually an ode to Darkchild.\n\nFrom here on, the tempo dips into a stream of ballads; second single the piano ballad \"Long distance\" (which sounds a bit like Janet Jackson's \"Again\"), the gently shifting \"Human\", the stunning \"Shattered heart\" (with ghostly harmonies and tempo shifts to stomping club beats in parts), the stirring \"True\" (beautiful song), the rather clever \"A Capella (Something's missing)\" (as its name implies is a capella with just harmonies, finger snaps and some vocal electric guitar effects in the background. It perfectly showcases the superb vocal layering she's known for), the adorable \"1st & love\" (with thundering beats in the chorus, my favourite) and closing the Natasha Bedingfield co-penned \"Fall\" (with interesting drum patterns). The last 5 songs stand out by a mile from the rest of the album.\n\nIt is good to have Brandy back (Her dusky vocals sound as great as ever) but I think this album is a bit bogged down by some rather ordinary songs (\"Camouflage\" and \"Torn down\" sound like they were bought from the same shop Beyonc got most of the songs on her boring \"I am..\" disc), and the upbeat songs sound like they have been done before. Still, I hope it can give her the comeback she deserves.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I think it's difficult to expect a lot from a new Bangles cd.  Their last full one was 1989's 'Everything'.  In my opinion it is hard for them to ever top their debut album (not their EP).  You had to figure U.S. record companies must have had similar thoughts since this disk has been released everywhere else since early 2003.\nThey still have decent songwriting abilities and continue to have great blended harmonies (\"Stealing Rosemary\").  Both of these things are their saving grace.\nEach member has one very good song. Debbie Peterson has \"Here Right Now\", which should have been the initial single. Susanna Hoffs has \"Something That You Said\", which is the first single and would have been a great follow-up single selection. Vicki Peterson has \"Single By Choice\" and Michael Steele has \"Between the Two\".  There are others that are certainly ok, just nothing outstanding.  Even \"Ride the Ride\" isn't as good as the version I downloaded off the internet (oops) almost 2 years ago.\nOverall, Debbie Peterson and Michael Steele are the most consistent on this disk.  Steele has always been under-utilized as a lead vocalist and songwriter. Nothing changes here.  I'm really liking her  \"Song For a Good Son\".  She's at least got the most original material of the four - and always has. I always liked Vicki Peterson's stuff, but it's all just very bland on this disk (\"Ask Me No Questions\").  Susanna Hoffs is astonishingly the weakest during this set (except for the aforementioned 'Something That You Said\").  \"I Will Take Care of You\" is just downright lame.\nIn my opinion, the album closer, 'Grateful', is possibly the worst song the Bangles have ever done.  The chorus is one step away from a bad children's chorale.  And they did nothing special to cover the Elvis Costello title tune.\nSupposedly they are working towards a new release, since this has really been completed for a year.  Let's hope they get it together and deliver a stellar disk.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"This album was a great shock, understandably, to many people when it came out - almost as much as Self-Portrait was. For that reason, and for Dylan's subsequent backing off from his Born Again phase - which has since received a certain \"cornpone\" status in his mythology - this album is often overlooked by many people. Let me be honest: if it wasn't Bob Dylan who made this album, I probably never would've listened to it, much less bought it. I am not a religous person, and Gospel and Gospel-inflected music are not among my favorites. I held off on buying this and made it one of my last Dylan purchases. However, let me be the first to tell you that I was pleasantly surprised! Odd as it may seem, this album is actually a return for Dylan in many ways. Ever since Blood On The Tracks, Dylan had been dipping his toe into more and more complex musical visions - the international vibe of the Desire album, the Rolling Thunder Revue, the big band-addled Street Legal, and his subequent \"Vegas\" tour - and this album goes back to the stripped-down rock band arrangements that he had long been known for. Whether or not you like it as much as his previous two albums - I don't, personally - it's easy to see that it's more focused, more concise, and that Bob was way more into it. Here we see him, perhaps for the first time ever, trying his hardest to make his music as smooth, polished, and presentable as possible. Clearly, Dylan was trying to reach as many as people as possible with this album, something he had never cared about before. The production by Barry Beckett and Jerry Wexler on this album is immaculate, and still sounds great today. It sounds better than anything he has recorded and released since (with the exception of the re-mastered songs on Biograph.) It's a sad fact that Columbia has neglected the Bob Dylan catalog - without argument, their most important artist - with only one of his albums, Street Legal, being remastered; and this is one of his few albums that still sounds great today. Furthermore, Dylan took even greater steps: hiring the then-in vogue (and terrific) group Dire Straits to be his backing band, and going down to Alabama to record the album with the Muscle Shoals Horns and a full gospel choir. Although the music on this album is not his best, and certainly not his most original, it is a very tight, focused effort. Mark Knopfler has gotten props several times for his playing on this album, and it's easy to see why. The rest of the players, as well as the production, are top-notch as well. The album is not necessarily what you might expect lyrically, either. Certainly, it's steeped highly in Christian imagery and Biblical allusion, particularly that of the book of Revelation. But, Dylan had been weaving Biblical allusions into his lyrics for his entire caree - from early tracks like When The Ship Comes In to practically the entire album John Wesley Harding, to the deeply spiritual-leaning Street Legal. Of course, he had never approached it the way he does on here. They are not merely enrichening the songs, they ARE the songs. The lyrics can be a bit dogmatic at times - and, of course, self-righteous - but you can enjoy, and like, them regardless of your own personal set of beliefs. Even if you don't agree with the opinions expressed within, you can still appreciate them as art. They do often have a very arrogant ring to them - Bob is practically breathing fire and brimstone on some of the tracks! No less a figure than Nick Cave has gone on record as saying that this is his all-time favorite album, citing its \"anger and nastiness... certainly not like the thing you find on most Christian albums.\" We get bitter, impassioned performances from Dylan on such songs as Gotta Serve Somebody and Slow Train. He hadn't been this focused and into his material since... well, quite a long time. You can tell he's really into it, and truly pouring his heart out into his vocals and his performances. Standout tracks include the Gotta Serve Somebody, a \"list\" song with some truly biting vocals from Dylan (it's just unbelievably cool to hear him stretch out that word \"somebody\"), for which he won a greatly deserved vocal performance Grammy. Precious Angel is nothing less than a love song - a moving ode to the woman who turned him on to Christianity. Slow Train is an absolutely ferocious song that attacks corrupt politics - one of the album's sub-themes - while weaving in much distressing imagery from Revelation. I Believe In You is an absolutely beautiful song about unwavering faith (Dylan as JOB.) To be sure, not all the songs are of this quality, and some even border on embarrassing, now. Still, this is quite a good album, and an essential one for any Dylan fan. Whatever one might say about Dylan's conversion, one thing is certain: it re-invigorated him artistically, and got him interested in his work again and he turned out his most focused and concise album since Blood On The Tracks.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"MAGMA is an excellent album from the French metal band -- less complex this time around, yet retaining their distinctive sound, which began as death metal some years back.  I am not a fan of death metal, so this is fine with me!  Guitarist\/vocalist Joe Duplantier and his brother Mario, the drummer, built their own studio in NYC where they did the recording.\n\nThe album is well constructed, with diverse alternating moods and styles. The opening \"Shooting Star\" is slow and brooding, and is followed by three powerful and heavy songs -- \"Silvera,\" \"The Cell,\" and \"Stranded.\" The instrumental \"Yellow Stone,\" which sounds Celtic, provides a breather before another powerful trio -- \"Magma,\" \"Pray,\" and \"Only Pain.\" \"Low Lands\" is more reflective, with a lyric that seems to be addressed to the band's namesake:\n\n\"in all there is to learn\nthe sun is on our side\nand though you're on the run\nyou will survive\n\nexpanded to the state of light\nthe deepest corners of the world\ngliding through the lowlands\nand swimming all the oceans\n\nwhile you drift away\nfrom all the plagues of this world\nyou're put out of misery, giant\nmonster\"\n\nI'm only now catching up with the band, but it seems clear that Gojira is building a bigger and bigger following, expanding beyond the extreme metal underground like a monster headed for the center of the city!

{"text":"If you've never heard of Monster Magnet, then I pity you. This band rocks HARD, and their music is beyond awesome. Monolithic Baby is just one of the albums that showcase their talents. The songs here have a tendency to make you want to play some air guitar (that's not what I do, personally). Either that, or make you want to buy the album straight away. Songs like \"Radiation Day,\" \"Hotel Baby,\" \"The Right Stuff,\" and \"Too Bad\" are surefire winners of ultimate stoner rock. \"Monolithic\" is just craves for your attention (and that's a good thing), while \"Master of Light,\" my personal favorite on the album, can be best described as nothing short of amazing. \"There's No Way Out of Here\" and \"Ultimate Everything\" should go down in history as two of the most underrated rock songs of the 2000's.\n\nI'm just getting into Monster Magnet's other albums, and I don't think I'll stop because their music is never boring or dull.

{"text":"Honestly, the past few years for Robin Thicke have been very hard for him and his personal life, with the end of his marriage to Paula Patton, and losing big in regards to a lawsuit with his song Blurred Lines, which resulted in paying the family of Marvin Gaye for using one of Marvin's songs, Got To Give It Up, without permission, and his lackluster Paula album, failing to ignite in regards to sales and deep hearts. He has had a lot of sadness that has definitely gone through his heart. But for Robin's latest single, it has given him a little bit of a boost from the heart, and the new sense of purpose of the Robin Thicke that used to be more of a crooner. Morning Sun, Robin's latest song is actually a good song that really takes it back to square one with his own soul from the lost few years. If you have loved Lost Without U and The Sweetest Thing, than you will absolutely this song from Robin Thicke. I sincerely recommend you download this song.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Bach Guild has done it again. The highlight here, as others have mentioned, are ten of Bruce Hungerford's superb Piano Sonatas from a widely lauded set of the Beethoven sonatas that was left uncompleted when he was killed in a car accident at the age of 55. The earlier Bach Guild&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Beethoven-Box\/dp\/B00AOMZHSO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Beethoven Box<\/a>&nbsp;contains 14 Hungerford sonatas. Four are duplicates--the only duplicates in the new set, I think. If ou don't already have the earlier Beethoven Big Box, you should buy that and then you'll have all the Beethoven sonatas Hungerford recorded. That alone is worth the price of admission. [UPDATE: Bach Guild mislabeled two of the Beethoven sonatas, No. 14 (Moonlight) and No. 32 (Op 111) as by Hungerford, but further research they're really by Giuomar Novas, who is correctly credited with play No. 26 in the set. This means that, in fact, there's less duplication than we were led to believe, and a couple of new and really good performances of major piano sonatas by yet another a distinguished pianist.]\nAnd there's much other cool stuff here. Dennis Matthews renditions of the Beethoven Bagatelles Op. 33, 119 and 126 are top-notch. We have some nice recordings of WoO works for piano by Jorge Demus.\nAnd then are the suprisingly gorgeous selections of Scottish, Irish and Welsh songs with Denis Stevens leading the Academia Monteverdiana and some fine English soloists. Beethoven scholars often write these pieces off as mere potboilers, but if these are potboilers, give me more of them. And really, I wish there were many more of these songs. The four here, including a \"to die for\" \"Auld Lang Syne,\" merely whet the appetite.\nI haven't even mention the  Beethoven violin sonatas #s 1-5 with Szigeti and Arrau. Sonatas 8-10 are in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Big-Violin-Box\/dp\/B00M5NXYWG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Big Violin Box<\/a>, so for a pittance, you can have the almost-complete Beethoven violin sonatas performed by two of the greats of 20th century music. The sound is a bit scratchy, but these are unique and valuable performances.\nI confess I haven't listened to the symphony performances yet, but the rarely heard dances that are here in abundance are fun.\nThere's lots here to like (or love) and while you're at it, pick up th earlier Beethoven Box (now back down to 99 cents) and the Violin Box as well, if you don't already have them.","classification":5,"fold":7}

And I know the guys have skills, but they have weird ways of using them on here.\n\"Out Of Breath\" is a good song, but it sounds just like \"Hanging By A Moment\"; and when you stop to think about it, so does \"Spin\" (but not as much). \"Anchor\" is really overproduced, while the chorus to \"Wash\" could stand to be rewritten. And while I'm talking about the lyrics, Jason tends to say \"All I want is you\" repeatedly in a lot of the songs.\nNone of the songs are bad per se (well, maybe they could've left \"My Precious\" behind), but the songs sound so much like their previous work that it makes you wonder where originality factors in.

{"text":"I've been a fan of Type O ever since I first heard \"Blood & Fire\" on my Mortal Kombat soundtrack cassette when I was 10. When Peter Steele died, I felt like I had just lost an uncle. But enough with the biography, let's get on to the review...\n\nI picked this album up when it first came out, and I honestly wasn't very impressed. I liked the fact that they had gone back to the long, complex song structures, but other than that, I really wasn't feeling it.\n\nRecently, I started throwing this album in more often and found myself loving it more and more. At this point, I would have to say that it's my favorite next to Slow Deep and Hard, and Bloody Kisses. Musically, this album is a complete success. Their maturity really shows, and the gothic Beatles-esque melodies that were absent from Life is Killing Me have returned.\n\nI would go so far to label these songs as \"beautiful\". With the exception of Halloween in Heaven (it's waaaay too cheesey), I would give these songs 9 and 10\/10 each. My absolute favorites are: September Sun, These Three Things, She Burned Me Down, and Hail and Farewell to Britain. I may even have to say this album is tied for 2nd place with Bloody Kisses only because this album flows better where BK was kind of all over the place stylistically.\n\nAll in all, this is a great swansong to Peter Steele's amazingly unique career. Buy this. Set aside an hour or so and listen to this album as a whole. Loudly, I might add. It will not disappoint.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Few would have guessed that Type O Negative would still be developing and improving after all these years. Sure, this album may not contain any obvious classics, and some longtime fans may complain that distinctness and variety are missing from the band's most recent work. But at the level of an entire album, Dead Again is the most consistent and accomplished release of Type O Negative's career. The band's wild-and-wooly past achievements, not to mention Peter Steele's darkly odd sense of humor, are still represented here in \"Dead Again,\" \"Halloween in Heaven,\" and \"Some Stupid Tomorrow.\" But otherwise, many of the songs on this album show great strides in the Type O game plan, and as an overall statement this album is a punishing display of sonic architecture and mood manipulation. The playing is better than ever before, with guitarist Kenny Hickey and drummer Johnny Kelly toughening up their attacks considerably. Kenny's throat-shredder vocals are also utilized with great success, offering effective counterpoints to Peter's always grave-rattling lower baritone. There is some intrigue in the songwriting department as well, including the dramatic quasi-ballad \"September Sun,\" which includes a surprisingly romantic piano intro from Josh Silver.\n\nMeanwhile, Type O's songs are getting longer and longer overall, and here the lengthy compositions offer the band room for true musical exploration, rather than just repetition. This album's pinnacle is surely the sinister epic \"The Profit of Doom,\" while the 14-minute apocalypse \"These Three Things\" actually manages to stay musically fascinating throughout its entire length (though it tends toward Tool-ness in places). One source of static here may be the lyrics, as Peter's eccentric manic-depressive humor has been largely replaced by esoteric neo-Catholic theology, particularly in \"An Ode to Locksmiths\" and the aforementioned \"These Three Things.\" Also, many reviewers seem to be picking out one song that doesn't quite work, and I would nominate the sluggish \"She Burned Me Down,\" which isn't quite the epic slow-burner that it thinks it is. But overall, Type O Negative have nearly two decades of crushing and subversive goth-metal under their belts, and this album shows that they're not even close to slowing down yet.

{"text":"I had the great pleasure of paying a closer attention to legendary country singer-songwriter Willie Nelson's last three CD releases that I couldn't let this new CD 'To All The Girls' (18 tracks) pass me by without a spin. The last three albums I'm talking about are his impressive collaboration with icon trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and the graceful Nora Jones in the 2011 CD 'Here We Go Again: Celebrating The Genius Of Ray Charles' (a live recording), the 2012 country gem CD 'Heroes' and the incredible 2013 diverse CD 'Let's Face The Music And Dance'.\n\nLike wine, Willie Nelson (WN) at 80 shows no sign of slowing down and he's on a roll in this great duet album 'To All The Girls'. WN is great on guitar and his voice is great and enticing as ever. The 'girls' are great female singers that the record label team could invite and assemble for this project (diverse 18 singers mainly from country music genre but also those from other genres as in Mavis Staples, Norah Jones, Alison Krauss and Emmylow Harris). It's an incredible display of song arrangements and dueting by Willie Nelson, his producer and guest artists. Great classics are given a fresh dress-up in this CD release as in the tracks \"Far Away Places\" (orchestral based track featuring Sheryl Crow), \"Always On My Mind\" (slow-tempo track with an incredible melody & vocals featuring Carrie Underwood) & \"Have You Ever Seen The Rain\" (slow-tempo track with a beautiful melody and vocals featuring Paula Nelson). My real surprise was the cover track \"Dry Lightning\" from 1995 Bruce Springsteen's acoustic album 'The Ghost Of Tom Joad'. It's well done featuring Emmylow Harris and even The Boss should be impressed.\n\nStands-outs\/gems\/my favourites are the tracks \"From Here To The Moon And Back\" (orchestral, great melody & vocals. It's a Dolly Parton composition for the 2012 movie Joyful Noise and features the lady herself: gracious vocals), \"Please Don't Tell Me How The Story Ends\" (wonderful violin, melody & vocals featuring Rosanne Cash), \"Always On My Mind\", \"Somewhere Between\" (slow-tempo track with beautiful accordion & melody featuring Loretta Lynn), \"Back To Earth\" (incredible music instruments arrangement. Melonie Cannon, her vocals are incredible), \"Will You Remember Mine\" (orchestral, slow-tempo track with wonderful melody and vocals featuring Lily Meola), \"Making Believe\" (featuring Brandi Carlile) & Creedance Clearwater Revival classic cover \"Have You Ever Seen The Rain\". There is no weak track or CD filler in this great CD 'To All The Girls'.\n\nOn overall, legendary singer-songwriter Willie Nelson is incredible in this new CD release, great music by the master, wonderful guest artists ('the girls') and production. A highly recommended CD for your listening pleasure.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.\n\nLYRICS:\nA long long time ago there was a volcano\nLiving all alone in the middle of the sea\nHe sat high above his bay watching all the couples play\nAnd wishing that he had someone too\nAnd from his lava came this song of hope that he sang\nOut loud everyday for years and years\n\nI have a dream I hope will come true\nThat you're here with me and I'm here with you\nI wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above-a\nWill send me someone to lava\n\nYears of singing all alone turned his lava into stone\nUntil he was on the brink of extinction\nBut little did he know that living in the sea below\nAnother volcano was listening to his song\nEveryday she heard his tune her lava grew and grew\nBecause she believed his song was meant for her\nNow she was so ready to meet him above the sea\nAs he sang his song of hope for the last time\n\nI have a dream I hope will come true\nThat you're here with me and I'm here with you\nI wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above-a\nWill send me someone to lava\n\nRising from the sea below stood a lovely volcano\nLooking all around but she could not see him\nHe tried to sing to let her know that she was not there alone\nBut with no lava his song was all gone\nHe filled the sea with his tears and watched his dreams disappear\nAs she remembered what his song meant to her\n\nI have a dream I hope will come true\nThat you're here with me and I'm here with you\nI wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above-a\nWill send me someone to lava\n\nOh they were so happy to finally meet above the sea\nAll together now their lava grew and grew\nNo longer are they all alone with aloha as their new home\nAnd when you visit them this is what they sing\n\nI have a dream I hope will come true\nThat you'll grow old with me and I'll grow old with you\nWe thank the earth, sea, the sky we thank too\nI lava you\nI lava you\nI lava you","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Jason Mraz is definitely an underrated artist in the music world. It's all too easy to write him off as another John Mayer\/Dave Matthews type artist. Nope, M.R.A.Z. is a whole nother breed. He has a little bit country, little bit rap, bit adult alt, bit pop, bit folk, the point is, Mraz can do it all. And this song shows all those elements, and the song writing style of Mraz. Even though this song was co-written by The Matrix song writing group, you can tell which parts are theirs, and which parts are Mraz.\n\nFirst off, the opening lines are awesome, and really set the tone for the verses. They're out of the ordinary, but seem to fit, and most importantly flow. And that's what this song's got going for it the most, flow. The verses, the pre-chorus, the chorus all flow freely even though they all have their unique style. This is accomplished for the most part by Mraz's vocals. The structure is also unique in that it has the verses which are great in of themselves, then you have the pre-chorus which could be a chorus in its own right, and then you have the chorus, which is in true radio-friendly style to grab those radio people, and has the true influence of The Matrix.\n\nIn fact, the only thing you could really criticize the song about is the pre-chorus, as it may just be one chorus too many, or maybe it could be a thinly veiled reference to sex or something. In either case, it both works, and it doesn't. I personally think it should have its own song, although it does great in this song.\n\nSo overall, definitely not your everyday radio fare. It may have a few of those elements, but it has enough originality to keep you interested and tuned in. Kudos to everybody involved with song. It's well-written, well-sung, and well-structured. This song is just another in the long list of reasons to love Jason Mraz.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"So I approached Jewel's \"0304\" album with an open mind, knowing full well that the days of \"Who Will Save Your Soul\" are long behind us. It's not the out-right \"bad\" album that I had feared, but it's also not a \"classic\" by any stretch of the imagination.\n\"0304\" (14 tracks, 53 min.) starts of nicely with \"Stand\", with its light-beat dance rhythms. \"Run 2 U\" and \"Intuition\" follow along the same vein, and then it starts to set it: the songs all sound pretty much the same! Oh no! That's the trouble with an album that goes on WAY too long, it all starts sounding the same. Admittedly, there are a couple of outstanding tracks: the dramatic (and non-dance) \"Haunted\", and the name-dropping and culture-referencing \"America\".\nOverall, this is an average, somewhat bland album. What surprises me is that in the liner notes, Jewel writes that this album is \"the first record I enjoy listening to\", which in a way is a put-down to all the fans that have loved her earlier albums. It makes me ache for the knock-out punch of \"Deep Water\/What's Simple is True\/Hands\", from the Spirit album: Jewel was never better.","classification":3,"fold":7}

I like the song a lot, he definitely follows in suit with the greats in voice he grew up listening to, like Frank Sinatra.

{"text":"No surprises here for long time Motorhead fans, \"Motorizer\" is yet another slamming bluesy hard as hell rock and roll album for Lemmy Kilmister and his bandmates.  Like AC\/DC before him, Kilmister has always known his strengths, and consistently delivered pretty much the same type of album from day one, full of bluster and sloppy during the Fast Eddie\/Philthy Animal Taylor years, and growing into more musical territory without sacrificing one bite.\n  \"Motorizer\" is a fine later period Motorhead CD, but then again, they all are.  Phil Campbell is the longest serving guitarist in the band and is as beloved as Clarke, maybe more so.  Mickey Dee is tight as hell, and it's this lineup that has consistently outrocked everybody.  Lemmy's lyrics are more pointed, politically and socially, but like on \"English Rose\", his love for the ladies is still present, albeit in a tongue in cheek way.\n  Kilmister has long hated religion and closes out with \"The Thousand Names of God\", further attacking an institution he views as one of the most terrible concepts ever devised.  \"Motorizer\" is a fast paced blistering rocker that Motorheadbangers should have if they don't.  The spirit of rock and roll as it was intended lives in Motorhead.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I would hear Kem on the radio, mostly on the stations which focused on playing jazz music and said to myself, \"This is just where this artist belongs\". I liked his voice from the first time I was introduced to it. It's very unique and befitting for jazz. It has been a long time since I have heard Kem on the radio, but something just compelled me to pick up his debut album and listen closely; I'm glad I did.\n\nPlease be warned: The younger generation may not like or appreciate this album. For example, when I was listening to this album, my brother gave me a crazy look and said, \"What the hell are you listening to?\" On the contrast, my older sister heard me playing the LP and said, \"You know about Kem? I didn't know you liked Kem!\" I really don't want to limit him to a particular audience, by this really is grown folks music. There is not one up-tempo song  in sight, just slow jams and mid-tempos. Everyone doesn't always like fast music anyway; I'm one of them. I can easily appreciate an album comprised of quiet storm tracks especially since radio plays almost all upbeat music. I get so tired of it, I hardly ever listen to the radio nowadays. \"Love Calls\" was the first single from \"Kemistry\" and what a fantastic song it is! Kem makes sure that he croons women and gives the fellers something to think about. This song is very laid back and mellow; it's sure to put one in a romantic mindset. Also, the lyrics are really good. He's letting the listening know that when love calls, there is no where to hide. \"Inside\" and \"Cherish this Moment\" are fine moments on the album. These tracks actually bring Sade to mind. I love the hook on \"Inside\" simply because it's catchy. This album is slightly flawed because it was boring in a few areas, but overall, I was impressed.  He did a fine job.\n\nMikeisha's Top 5\n\n1. \"Inside\"\n2. \"Brotha Man\"\n3. \"Love Calls\"\n4. \"I'm Missin' Your Love\"\n5. \"Miss You\"","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Emmylou's \"Hard Bargain\" unfolds with grace as she spreads her wings as a songwriter.  \"The Road\" that opens the set has grown on me with repeated listenings with the sonic landscape broad & expansive, \"I come down from the mountain; I come walkin' in your shoes; I was taken for a gambler when I had no more to lose.\"  It's exquisite.  Emmylou tackles the death of Emmett Till, a martyr for the cause of civil rights in a fitting musical elegy.  Harris turns up the tempo on \"New Orleans\" with Jay Joyce's high string guitar imitating the sound of raindrops.  Harris' sense of humor comes to the fore on the loping \"Big Black Dog.\"  The melodic title track evokes sadness and anticipation, \"Each time I'm headin' for nowhere, doomed & determined to go there.\"  \"Darlin' Kate\" is a lovely elegy, I assume for Kate McGarrigle.  The set concludes with the tantalizing \"Cross Yourself\" that builds and blooms like a gentle caress.  \"Hard Bargain\" is not flashy, but it is deep, heartfelt and has some passionate and emotional vocals by one of our master musicians.  Enjoy!","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"\"We hope you will be willing to bat this music around, turn it inside out, caress and pound it, question it, and we hope that something of value, something unexpected remains.\" ~ Tierney Sutton ~\n\nThe Tierney Sutton Band takes some of the best-loved standards from the Great American Songbook and elevates them to a more creative and innovative level of renditions. The end-result is a truly wonderful album that can be enjoyed for all the years to come. Ms. Sutton is a singer of a-rare-form who consistently lends finesse and elegance to all the songs she interprets. Underneath that beautiful voice is a line-up of incredible musicians such as Christian Jacob (piano), Ray Brinker (drums), Trey Henry and Kevin Axe (bass).\n\nOn the very first time I listened to this remarkable album, I forwarded it to track six, set it on repeat mode and listened endlessly before listening to the rest of the tracks. I was simply moved and blown away by her impressive delivery of \"Then I'll Be Tired Of You,\" a great song from the pens of two brilliant songwriters America has ever known, E.Y. Hamburg and Arthur Schwartz. She has made it her very own and given it the retire-the-trophy treatment. Likewise, she gives this nearly-forgotten song a new lease on life and made it alive again. Her interpretation is the best-ever. She even bested Ella's, Sarah's and Peggy's versions of this rarely-recorded, one of my favorites and was once my song for my ex-hubby (so it is very special - it evokes fond, cherished and hauntingly beautiful memories). Accompanied only by Christian Jacob's striking chops on piano, she has conveyed the true essence of the song in a very simple delivery yet utterly gorgeous. Kudos to Ms. Sutton and Mr. Jacob for the most exquisite interpretation ever recorded, bar none. This alone is worth the price of admission. A charming twenty-second piano intro is heard prior to Ms. Sutton's heart-stopping rendition that is so full of heartfelt emotion and tender perfection...\n\n\"I'll be tired of you\nWhen stars are tired of gleaming\nWhen I am tired of dreaming\nThen I'll be tired of you\n\nThis I know is true\nWhen winds are tired of blowing\nWhen grass is tired of growing\nThen I'll be tired of you\n\nBeyond the years till day is night\nTill wrong is right, till birds refuse to sing\nBeyond the years the echo of my only love\nMust still be whispering, whispering\n\nAnd if my throbbing heart\nShould ever start repeating\nThat it is tired of beating\nThen I'll be tired of you\"\n\nThe band cleverly treats the material with overwhelming inventiveness yet staying true to the spirit of each song. The arrangements are exceptional and the interpretations are sublime. Ms. Sutton's artistry is defined by her clarity of vocals, flawless diction and excellent phrasing. The musicians' instrumentations are, as always, top-notch and beautifully-executed.\n\nI never thought that there will be a version as gorgeous as Ella Fitzgerald's \"Then I'll Be Tired Of You\" or Sarah Vaughan's \"Whatever Lola Wants\" or Peggy Lee's \"Fever\" or Julie London's \"Cry Me A River\" or Dianne Reeves' \"Skylark\" or Billie Holiday's \"Love Me Or Leave Me,\" but she proves me wrong on that notion. With her exquisite renditions, she gives these songs new meanings and fresh styles. She now shares the ownership of such songs with the aforementioned jazz divas, with the exception of \"Then I'll Be Tired Of You\" - she made it a gem of a song, hence, she is now the sole owner.\n\nThe beauty of this album is that it stays interesting to the end - there's never a dull moment listening to it in its entirety. I'm totally jazzed! There's nothing left to be desired in an album.\n\nWith my heartfelt recommendation.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Whether it is an instrumental track or a guest-vocal one, Jamie XX shows off his polished and intricate compositions and direction. When partners in crime from The XX, Romy Madley-Croft and Oliver Sim join him on tracks See-Saw and Stranger in a Room respectively, magic of a different kind, apart from their main group, is sparked. The best track, Gosh, which also starts the album is simply the track of the year. The instrumental bringing you from the mid-section right to the end will be the most dazzling and emotive thing you will ever hear this year. Not even a certain mega-diva could rival that.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Applause, the lead single from her third album Artpop is actually not one of her better songs. In fact, it felt definitely weaker than a lot of the tracks she did from her last album Born This Way, and I wasn't impressed with the bulk of the songs from that record either.

{"text":"Outside the supernova explosions of the early Jackson 5, Michael Jackson's peak years were '80-'82 of Off The Wall and Thriller. In fact, Thriller and its breakthrough, extended-length video dominated mainstream popular music during its amazing chart run. Those years, also, however, hosted rebellions against that same mainstream, with punk and new wave bands continually storming the staid pavilions. A lot of people were fed up with corporate crap, top-down thinking and the pop band as commodity\/tool. Michael Jackson was anything but staid, but he was of them. I mean, Quincy Jones! Industry creation though he was, Jackson synthesized the tension and energy around him to reach his creative zenith, plunging his music into the currency of sexual politics well-beyond the dance floor blatherings that typically decorate even genius killer grooves. He produced the toughest, most sophisticated work of his career in \"Billie Jean.\" That song touched off a widespread national conversation about the dangers and responsibilites of sex. But as big as Thriller was, Michael Jackson never again displayed the confident, at-ease sexuality of Off the Wall and his hits were scarcely more beloved than the best of hitmakers Hall and Oates from that point on. The opening Jackson 5 bombs detonate here as if preparing you, and the big early 80's hits still deliver a huge amount of excitement. This holds well up into \"Bad,\" opening the second CD, then slowly unwinds until midway into the second disc it completely disappears under a showcase of embarassing schlock. And that includes the DOA dance floor misfire \"Dangerous,\" which does nothing to illuminate beat cues cribbed from Prince. The Essential Michael Jackson shows a tantalizing artist on a blazing short run, shaping the best dance grooves in the land into actual cohesive songs. I certainly love him yet its pretty obvious listening to this Essentials package that Jackson's place in the pantheon is cushioned with padding.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I have always considered Audiomachine to be one of the best in the business.  As the world of \"trailer music\" and \"epic score\" gets larger, these artists must differentiate themselves in order to stand out.  Audiomachine can do bold and intense cues as good as anyone, but the result is always more than just loud noises - their music tells a story and paints a vivid picture in your mind.\n\nI was a big fan of Audiomachine's last album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Chronicles\/dp\/B007RJSQYE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Chronicles<\/a>.  That album was epic with 28 tracks and over an hour of music.  By contrast, \"Epica\" has just 12 tracks totaling 43 minutes.  Of course, quality is always more important than quantity, but it still feels as though this album lacks the value that the previous one had.\n\nThe album gets off on the right foot: the first track, \"Prologue: Birth\" is incredible.  There are many other strong tracks, including \"Fire and Honor\" and \"The New Earth\".  In fact, the entire album is almost consistently strong, even if some of the tracks begin to sound a bit similar.  Among the 12 tracks are a few cues that may sound familiar to attentive listeners - Track 6, titled \"Knights and Lords\", was recently used in a trailer for the film \"Prometheus\".\n\nOverall, \"Epica\" is just a bit too short and not quite diverse enough.  The album never reaches the heights of the best tracks on \"Chronicles\".  But it's still a worthy entry for Audiomachine, and I'm already looking forward to their next album!","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"First of all, I consider Jaheim to be one of the standout male R&B singers of our time.  Unfortunately for Ja, he hasn't found commercial success easily. Sure, GHETTO LOVE and STILL GHETTO went platinum, but it took time and airplay. Last year's GHETTO CLASSICS landed Jaheim in the top spot of the Billboard Chart yet it only went gold (and its chart stay was brief as well)and none of his excellent singles made a splash at radio.  Sad considering \"Everytime I Think About Her\" and \"The Chosen One\" were both fine songs, among Jaheim's most soulful. This time around, Jaheim lands at Atlantic and the difference is noticeable.  Sure, Jaheim sounds as refined yet soulful at the same time, but the production doesn't feel as bombastic or bright as it did on last year's GHETTO CLASSICS.  It's not a bad thing, but despite this album being as consistent as any Jaheim album, it at times feels too safe and reserved. Vocally Jaheim is refined and never overdoes melisma, but you sometimes wish Jaheim would give just a bit more.\n\nThe material is overall fine, but a bit safe. The opening \"Voice of R&B\" has a nice vintage soul feel to it with the horns and 1970s feeling production. Jaheim still possesses his street-savvy persona here despite the soulful underlying production.  On \"Hush\", Jaheim gets his R. Kelly on (literally), though it isn't a complete successin my eyes.  Sure, Ja pulls it off pretty good, but I think Jaheim is better suited with soul-samples and vintage production work - nothing against Kells. It's not bad though, just different. \"Have You Ever\" and \"Lonely\" start to really heat things up while \"Life of a Thug\" truly brings the heat with its wah-wah clavinets, strings, and synthesized horn production.\n\n\"You Just Don't Get It\" isn't bad, though the highlights that follow are incredible.  \"She Ain't You\" is absolutely beautiful and is my personal favorite.  \"Never\" is a bit subtle, but maybe it is the subtlety that makes it so great. Jaheim vocal control is phenomenal here.  \"I've Changed\" features an as of late ubiquitous Keyshia Cole and proves to be solid as does \"What You Think of That\".  \"Make A Wish\" and \"Back Together Again\" are solid as well, if not as exceptional as the aforementioned best (\"Have You Ever\", \"Life of a Thug\", \"She Ain't You\", \"Never\", and \"You've Changed\".\n\nOverall, THE MAKINGS OF A MAN is Ja's fourth consistent effort.  Again, the material is good but safe in a couple of cases.  This isn't a bland effort, but it is even less ornate than GHETTO CLASSICS and there is no \"Could It Be\" this time around.  With that said, there are enough solid numbers to make this album overall enjoyable. 4 stars Ja.","classification":4,"fold":7}

For the first time (in a long time), the Grammy voters did the right by not giving an imposter an award. This cd sold hot, but it is not respected. 50 Cents even lost \"Best New Artist\" and had the nerve to get on stage to \"protest\". He only made himself look bad because no one saw his point (even his fellow rappers thought it was in bad taste). The worst offense to rap music this year is 50 Cents's \"Get Rich Or Die Tryin\" which is painfully dated. Gangsta rap died when 2Pac and Biggie died. Plus, this cd is not even \"gangsta\". Its corporate mindless rap, meant only to make money. I hope 50 realizes that his time is almost up.","classification":1,"fold":7}

For me, this one really had to grow on me. I had to listen again and again and let these songs sink in, let the atmosphere settle, and after a while I realized; this really is a fine album! And I think with the passing of time, after a few more years, more people will \"get it\" and there will be added appreciation for this lovingly crafted album. I still think there are few too many lulls and slow moments, but in an odd way that sort of adds to the vibe of the whole album. But the highs and sweet spots on here are very good. If you liked the previous album, give this one a try too, but be patient and don't force it. Let these songs work their subtle magic on you with the passing of time.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"It came especially late but alas we finally have a live Van Halen album featuring David Lee Roth. Tokyo Dome ln Concert was recorded on March 22 2013 during VH's last tour. It's not the band's first live album as there has been a live Van Hagar release but it's the first with Diamond Dave which fans had been asking for decades now. This lineup features the Van Halen brothers (of course) Alex and Eddie with DLR and Wolfgang Van Halen au lieu of original bassist Michael Anthony. One has to ask why a live album at this point late in their career but it's better late than never l suppose. Van Halen's classic lineup and first six albums with DLR from 1978-84 have touched and inspired generations. It's all-time classic rock and there are plenty of masterpieces and classics to be found. The band knows this too as they perform the songs that everyone wants to hear from those six albums along with a few from the current lineup's 2012 output A Different Kind of Truth.\n\nThe setlist is incredible! I mean seriously look at it ( They open with Unchained) and tell me that it's not damn well near perfect. All the hits are there along with favourites and that's one of the album's strengths and main appeal. I don't think l would've taken anything out. I wouldn't have added much more either. Anyone who complains is just nitpicking. I would've wanted to see \"You And Your Blues\" from ADKOT instead of \"Chinatown\" but that's about as picky as l can be. Everything l could've asked for is here. Two discs and 25 songs (one is a drum solo) at this price is excellent. Those things l can't complain about.\n\nNow let's address the elephant in the room. Yeah THAT one! Roth's singing. Sometimes he completely leaves out lines, his timing is off or at the very last second, and occasionally he'll almost talk instead of singing. To his credit he's getting up there in age and moves a lot during live performances, it's not getting any easier for him and l know criticism of his voice will be harsh towards this release. I'm trying not to be too harsh while reaming objective. Granted he doesn't sound great and there some not so good moments but Diamond Dave was never truly an amazing singer to begin with. Less so live. He was always known to be the charismatic and energetic frontman and no one could touch him. Ons of my favourite moments has Dave being Dave during the beginning of \"Pretty Woman\" where he goes : \"l know that song!  *pause* I know that song! *pause* l f****** love that song!\". People have mixed feelings to say the least about Wolfgang replacing Michael Anthony. I think it hurts them not to have Anthony around because his backing vocals were truly the band's secret weapon and they improved Dave's overall sound, something Wolfgang simply cannot do (but he does sound a little better now) but he does get the job done on the bass guitar. The back vocals are not awful and they try their best (You Really Got Me is a good effort) but they could have used Anthony's presence. Alex Van Halen has lost nothing with the years and plays incredible and the \"Me & You\" piece is amazing. Eddie does what he does best, and surprises us at times adding things here and there being the player we know he is. I can't say that they really live up to their past glory, but very few bands can and at the end of the day it's a fun performance.\n\nThe sound is very raw and bare-bones, it doesn't sound like it was overdubbed at all which is one of Tokyo Dome's best qualities. I think they were going for a bit of a bootleg sound, but not too much as clearly this exceeds a bootleg but VH wanted a real raw, gritty and heavy feel. Now the audience is essentially nowhere to be found. I own lots of live albums and this has got to be one of the quietest crowds l've heard for VH  (and a rock concert for that matter). I can only assume they turned them down during the mixing perhaps.\n\nOn a side note I think it was a missed opportunity to film the show and have it released as a CD\/DVD package, l think it would have helped gather even more interest in the band and Tokyo Dome. I'm just glad we finally have some new VH out and a live one with Dave.\n\nIs it perfect? No. Does it have it's flaws? Yes. Could it have been more? Well l think if you don't expect too much out out of Van Halen you will find much to enjoy. The guys are a little older, Dave's voice has aged and it's 3\/4 of the classic lineup but they can still deliver a good performance and entertain you. Some will completely rip on Dave's voice and l get it, it's the main reason l'm giving Tokyo Dome 3 stars. It does make you long for a proper live release from the early 80's. The musicianship though, is very good and the setlist incredible.","classification":3,"fold":7}

Some of the vocals sound like they were mailed in, or sent in via attachment on an email.  The choice of songs is rather annoying, too--we've all heard all of these songs over and over in many different versions, and unless you're going to do something new with them, why bother?  Oh, yeah--because you can make a ton of money without having to challenge yourself to do anything creative.  Very disappointing.","classification":2,"fold":7}

Lauper's original style will evoke memories of the 80's for those living in that era.  These songs have a classic and magical style to them that gets better with each listen.  Lauper's vocals are not for everyone.  For some they may be irritating but for others comforting.  Her powerful vocal range makes Madonna's vocals pale in comparison.  She can sing ballads as well as up-tempo 80's pop songs.  Co-writing every song on this album she proves to the public that she is a respected artist for the most part.  In 2008 she released a new album called \"Bring Ya To The Brink\" which is the style of dance-pop.","classification":5,"fold":7}

One of the songs on this EP is is from the n\/b Polydor album they released before joining Fleetwood Mac and purporting them onto Super stardom.  Couldn't Mick Fleetwood add some exotic songs from his occasional excursions into solo projects?  Ah well, it is what it is.

Some of the song choices themselves are encouraging\/soothing\/empathetic\/engaging to the double tragedy (massive earthquate & devastating tsunami), e.g. \"Shelter From The Storm\" by Bob Dylan, \"Human Touch\" by Bruce Springsteen, \"By Your Side\" by Sade, \"Hold On\" by Michael Buble, \"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\" by Elton John, \"Teo Torriate(Let Us Cling Together)\" by Queen, \"Fragile\" by Sting, \"Save Me\" by Nicki Minaj, \"If I Could Be With You\" by Enya & \"Pray\" by Justin Bieber. 2 CDs (36 tracks in total, Disc 1 = 17 tracks & Disc 2 = 19 tracks) with overall great music to hopefully warm the hearts of the Japanese communities torn apart by a natural disaster of Biblical proportion. Some music fans may have most of the songs already, but not as this compilation and hey it's for a very good charity cause!

{"text":"Otis Redding's passing and the appropriation of the original Stax catalog in 1967 was the biggest one-two punch out southern soul probably ever endured during it's orginal run in the mid to late 60's. Even so it would appear that up to the very end Otis Redding was musically prolific and moving in new directions even. One of the elements that characterizes this album is how Redding,long thought of as more of an interpretive singer actually emphasizes his excellent songwriting here and throws down some real showstoppers such as the deeply funky \"Hard To Handle\"-a tune that has not only been covered from everyone from Tom Jones to The Black Crowes but provides the important link between the sound of Stax in the 60's and what Al Green would do a few years later with the Hi sound,minus some of the light orchestration. He even follows up another one of his classics in \"The Happy Song\",a more upbeat and chorded variation on \"Fa Fa Fa Fa (Sad Song)\" from earlier.\n\n  The only cover tune here would have to be \"A Fool For You\",originally a bluesy Ray Charles hit which for this offering really brings out that country churchy\/gospel cry in Otis's voice-pleading and preaching rather than confessing in Charles. The album likewise concludes with his version of \"Amen\",which becomes a gospel medley in Reddings hands. One of the things,listening to this album today is that it shows you how much-especially in the hands of people such as James Brown and Curtis Mayfield how much soul and R&B made a very big about face rhythmically;from being more a vocal medium with some elements closer to rock and roll to the complex rhythmic patterns of the different funk and jazz hybrids of the genres in the next decade. Now in more recent years this kind of \"deep 60's soul\" has become the basis for much of the retro music in R&B. All the same it should be noted if Redding had lived he'd have even progressed so this music was likely the transitional element in a change he was planning to make rather than another variation on a theme. So in the end there's much to get excited about here.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Drenched in guitars and strings, and in a minor key, \"There Is A Tree\" hooked me the minute Carrie began to sing, and from there the album never lost my interest.  Thoughtful, unusual songs yet sound familiar, and upon a second listen, feel like old friends.  The instrumentation, although relatively spare, sounds full and rich, complimenting Newcomer's lovely, alto voice perfectly, without ever stealing the spotlight.  A few tracks have gentle, sometimes driving rhythms, and there are subtle yet surprising sounds around every bend, so there's enough variety to keep THE GEOGRAPHY OF LIGHT from becoming too somber.  In fact the title and the cover art are quite apt, as the general mood of this wonderful CD does remind me of one of those days when half the sky is dark with a passing storm, yet clear enough in spaces to let shafts of golden sunlight through.\n\nA couple of side notes: not only has Carrie written perhaps the only song ever sung about geodes, but she then ends this elegant album on an upbeat note with \"Don't Push Send,\" a highly amusing ditty about the dangers of writing and sending letters in cyber-space.  Presumably, she calls this a \"bonus track\" because it's so different from the rest of the album, but it works, and I've quickly decided that it's not a throwaway; it belongs here...\n\nI've been listening to Carrie Newcomer's songs for many years, and have most of her albums on CD.  But it wasn't until 2000's THE AGE OF POSSIBILITY that I thought Carrie had finally done a truly solid album.  In 2002 and 2005, respectively, she released two more fine CD's, GATHERING OF SPIRITS and REGULARS AND REFUGEES.  The latter included a single from the previous release, a BEST OF collection, \"Betty's Diner\" which had been inspired by her own short story.  The subsequent album was all about the people she imagined as customers of said diner.  The conceit worked well, and I could hardly wait to hear what Newcomer would come up with next.  It would be a two-year wait, but it was worth it.  I believe Carrie Newcomer has topped herself and turned out her best album yet.  Not a false step here; this is a woman who has hit her stride.  She has always written compelling lyrics, but this time out, the the melodies, music and arrangements rise to their level in just about every instance.  If you like thoughtful, mature songs that are about something, and your taste runs toward the melodic, I can recommend this CD without reservation.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Well we all did when he came out with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Black-Star\/dp\/B000067CLT\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Black Star<\/a>&nbsp;with Mos Def, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Reflection-Eternal-Train-of-Thought\/dp\/B000067CLQ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Reflection Eternal\/Train of Thought<\/a>&nbsp;with Hi-Tek. Yes in a time of crisis when hip-hop is under construction (as most would say if not worse) this album would be. Fortunately here most of everything here is on point. Talib's strong lyrical perfomance and Hi-Tek's great production here in 2010, and signed to a major record label WB (and loosing most, if not all the artists on your roster: Jean Grae, Strong Arm Steady, etc.) could you expect anything less?\n\nTo start with the bad first, unfortunately, Revolutions Per Minute (RPM), is nowhere near as good as the first Kweli and Ti-Tek colab. Not to say it's bad, but when you set the bar so high for fans, it's easy to make a less quality follow up together. Some of Hi-Tek's production sounds empty, and some songs have not so good hooks. For example \"Back Again\" with RES (where she been?) doesn't sound right with her vocals. \"In The Red\" and \"Long Hot Summer\" both suffers from forgettable production from Hi-Tek. On the latter song, even Talib sound weak.\n\nThe good about this album are songs like \"Lifting Off\", the catchy \"Get Loose\" with Chester French, and the classic appearances from Mos Def, Jay Electronica, and J. Cole on \"Just Begun\". The latter song is certified classic material. Other notable songs on this album are \"Ends\" with Bilial, and \"My Life (Outro)\". Songs not mentioned are neither good or bad, but were not really worth noting.\n\nSure we can all say that the bar for these two were set a decade ago, and to follow up with that is very hard, but that is like that with most artists. RPM is definately refreshing material from these two and I'm glad that it was finally put out to fans after such a long wait. If anything, I don't want to wait another 10 years for another colab from these two (even though they've made so many songs together on seprate albums). This one is greatly recommended, but my warning is not to approach it with high expectations. Peace.\n\nLyrics: B+\nProduction: B+\nGuest Appearances: A\nMusical Vibes: A-\n\nTop 5 Tracks:\n1.

{"text":"From the time I first heard John Legend's \"Green Light\" featuring Andre 3000, I knew that his forthcoming October 2008 album EVOLVER would be different from his previously critically lauded GET LIFTED (2004) and ONCE AGAIN (2006).  I wouldn't go so far as to say that EVOLVER is terrible as some critics and fans have said, but it is a different Legend album, save for the incredible soulful voice that remains unscathed by the hip-hop production. Also, I don't think \"different\" is bad either in this case - I actually like the album, though it doesn't work as well as his two previous albums.  It is perhaps the first truly flawed Legend album.  And what flaws it isn't necessarily the \"R. Kelly\" moves that Legend makes, but rather some of the songwriting is a bit blander than usual.  There are still hits, but nothing here is necessarily of the same magnitude of \"Use To Love You\", \"Ordinary People\", \"Save Room\", \"Heaven\", or \"Show Me\".  However, there are a couple of important tracks - it is John Legend, one of the voices of \"nu-soul\" after all!\n\nThe album opens up with an intro, \"Good Morning\" in which it sounds like John Legend has a had an erotic night of passion.  This track is insignificant for the most part, but it does signal that Legend is getting his \"mack\" on on this album as opposed to his more refined neo-soul tracks from his previous albums.  \"Green Light\", the first single featuring Andre 3000 demonstrates this concession with its hip-hop beat that sounds like he could've \"copped\" from an OutKast album.  Those who loved previous first Legend singles \"Use To Love You\" or \"Save Room\" may be  a bit surprised or disappointed, but honestly, despite a more contemporary sound, Legend sounds as good as ever and the track is solid by all means.  Keeping up the momentum is my personal favorite, \"It's Over\" features the newly vocoder-converted Kanye West.  The track is  a collaborative writing effort between Pharrell Williams (The Neptunes) and Kanye West.  The production is exceptional and John Legend soulful infused vocals sound perhaps the best of the entire album. West even sounds good utilizing the vocoder (singing), which ends up being a pleasant surprise (can't wait to buy 808s & HEARTBREAK). This production has a hip-hop influence, thought it is just as soulful as anything John Legend has ever performed.  This would make an exceptional choice for a single.\n\n\"Everybody Knows\" returns Legend back to his soulful roots absence of studio tricks, which is good for those who feel his makeover isn't truly Legend.  \"Everybody Knows\" is another favorite.  The Brandy duet on \"Quickly\" is solid as well, if not as sound as the previous performances.  It's potent enough, though not like the best of Legend.  \"Cross That Line\" balances the soul with the glitz of contemporary production with its \"hard drums\".  It is successful and blends the best of both worlds as opposed to showing two differing John Legends.  \"No Other Love\" is an exceptional cut from EVOLVER that sits Legend and the up and coming Estelle atop a brilliant tropical beat\/production.  Here both Legend and Estelle blend almost celestially and the vocal performances are particularly grand.  \"This Time\" is not quite \"Ordinary People\" from GET LIFTED, but it is similar in sound (save for the synths used).  It isn't quite a hit, but it is solid.  \"Satisfaction\" is enjoyable, produced by standout producer will.i.am (Black Eyed Peas).  After that, the album generally falls a bit flat.  \"Take Me Away\", \"Good Morning\", and \"I Love, You Love\" are OK, but they don't represent the full potential of a singer the magnitude of Legend.  \"If You're Out There\" is a solid closer and overall strong, thought perhaps not as strong as the very best (\"Green Light\", \"It's Over\", \"No Other Love\", etc.)\n\nOverall, this album is good, though not great like the other two Legend albums.  It is imperfect, but it is still enjoyable and worthy of note.  If you are a Legend fan and love to hear his soulful, distinctive voice, then you should purchase EVOLVER. 3  stars.","classification":4,"fold":7}

Being turned on by the beautiful album cover, I gave it a try and WOW! This is an absolutely gorgeous and elegant debut release. The CD is described as a mix of Yanni, Tangerine Dream, and Robert Miles. Overall, I describe this as closer to Robert Miles as opposed to the other two with the exception of \"Letting Go\" which has a very Yanni-esque feel but having a far more sophisticated and beauty that Yanni can only dream of. \"Secret Garden\" is arguably my favorite song on this release having a beautiful electronic beat and fast rhythm.

The strings and other back-up instruments that complement Persson's voice are spot on.\n\nWhile this song may not have the pop appeal or driving force it usually takes to gain major recognition, I've had this track on my iPod's playlist ever since it was made available at Amazon.com.\n\nThis song isn't what I'd cal mainstream country, folk, or even pop, but is an intruiging mixture of those genres.

Imagine my pleasant surprise when I noticed (after meeting my husband around 6-8 years later) that he enjoys this song (my husband had previously purchased the Fashion Nugget cd by Cake before I figured out he liked The Distance).  The Distance song by Cake gives the song imagery of race car driving and about a character who is so dedicated to his intensity for race car driving to where the interest at times encroaches on his personal life.

{"text":"Despite the title, this song is actually a pleasure to listen to.  I must first start off by saying how much I love the fact that that Three Days Grace manages to turn a song about love involving pain into a genius art form.  This is another fun song that I have on my zune player and I like how he expresses himself when he sings lyric such as \"trust me and take my hand\" \"when the lights go out you will understand\" and then the song pauses for s split second before he belts out pain among the right timed guitars to help break the pause.  He raises his voice some times during the songs but he does it at the right times in the songs such as in the end of it and at one of my favorite moments in the song when he sings \"I'm always here for you\" \"Iknow, I know, I know, I know that you'll thank me later\".  The lead singer's awesome voice goes perfect with this song. Anyhow, the interesting thing about this song is that if you would like to listen to a sensual erotic song that falls under the hard rock\/alternative rock genre then this song would be a must have in your musical collection.  It's been a couple of years since this song came out but I am still enjoying it and I am glad to have it as part of my musical collection.  This song is definitely recommended for rock music lovers amd even music lovers that may only be lightly into rock but would like to add something different to their musical collection.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Six years and one messy public breakup later and Ben Burnley has recruited new members drummer Shaun Foist, bassist Aaron Bruch, guitarist Jasen Rauch, and guitarist Keith Wallen and leads this reconstructed version of Breaking Benjamin through \"Dark Before Dawn.\" You could be forgiven for not noticing that the old band members are no longer around, but it also shows a minor flaw: the songs are little more than what you've heard on other BB albums.\n\nSo what does \"Dark Before Dawn\" have to offer? Well, you do have the fact that Burnley is the driving force (after all, the band name namechecks him), and his vocals still are as tough as ever. He does add melody to the well-hewn genre of hard rocking from the alternative zone. The push and pull between Burnley and the guitar licks are balanced nicely (although I will postulate that Aaron Fink was a hotter guitarist then either of the two newbies). There are the sharp, obvious singles (\"Failure,\" \"Defeated\" and \"Angels Fall\") that stand out from the pack and a couple non-singles that sound just as good (\"Hollow\"). Then there is the moment where BB opts to provide a different sound altogether.\n\n\"Ashes Of Eden\" has an atmospheric instrumental bed and gives Burnley the chance to drop the growling posture and actually sing. His natural voice is far more pleasant than you would have guessed. It's \"Dark Before Dawn's\" most original song and - by default - its best. It gives a fan hope that BB may have more hidden away in the trick bag than just worshiping Tool or Korn. So there you have it. There's little here to alienate longtime fans of \"Phobia\" or \"Dear Agony\" (still my favorite BB CD), but the new band doesn't break away from its sound after the long hiatus. It's just as you would expect it to sound in the scheme of things Breaking Benjamin-wise. That makes this review a minder for readers, if you like your alt-rock better than average, this CD will do just fine. Otherwise, you can take a pass.","classification":4,"fold":7}

Billy Elliot won Elton the tony for best musical in 2009 and the songs Elton and Bernie Taupin composed still have a lot of meaning today, as they did when they first came out in 2005. Electricity is one of those songs. The song originally appeared on the expanded version of Elton John's 2004 album Peachtree Road album.

The style of music on Where Have I Known You Before (1974) is somewhat similar to Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy (1973) although there is a bit more in the way of softer textures, making for a very balanced listening experience.\n\nThe lineup at this point included Chick Corea (Fender Rhodes electric piano, acoustic piano, clavinet, Yamaha organ, ARP Odyssey synthesizer, and percussion); bassist extraordinaire Stanley Clarke (Alembic electric bass guitar, Yamaha organ, bell tree, chimes; excellent drummer Lenny White (drums, percussion); and newcomer Al Di Meola (electric and acoustic guitars; acoustic 12 string guitar).  I think it goes without saying that this is a musician's band.  These guys are all unbelievably talented, with Stanley Clarke setting new standards for performance on the bass that would be equaled by few - this guy is mind-blowingly fast.  For his first time playing with RTF (Al was 19 at the time), Al does an incredible job, although his playing is not as dominant in the mix as it would become on later albums.  With this album, Chick had started weaving synthesizers into the RTF sound and he gets some great tone colors out of the ARP Odyssey on this album, which is plastered everywhere.  As a huge fan of progressive rock and electronica, I do not mind the analog synthesizer use at all, although some jazz fans might be turned off.\n\nThe eight tracks on the album range in length from 1'02\" to the 14'21\" Song to the Pharoah Kings suite.  In terms of the music, it is an incredible amalgamation of jazz; jazz rock; progressive rock; space rock; funk and even a tiny bit of classical - more like a proggy jazz rock actually.  In fact, as a progger, I really appreciate the dense arrangements and virtuosity.  Speaking of which, just about every odd time signature under the sun is used on Where Have I Known You Before and there is some incredibly complex ensemble work.\n\nSandwiched in-between the highly electric rave-ups are three of Chick's acoustic piano improvisations including Where Have I Loved You Before; Where Have I Danced With You Before; and Where Have I Known You Before.  This is the closest this album comes to sounding like traditional jazz and showcases Chick's considerable talents on the acoustic piano.  The softer acoustic tracks provide a nice contrast with the highly charged electric tracks.  Earth Juice is the \"funkiest\" piece on the album, although this funk is pretty far removed from Sly and the Family Stone.  Of course, Chick's work on the clavinet here and there on the album really lends to the funkiness.  The suite that closes the album out is a high point for me and opens with a great synthesizer arrangement, which then launches into some extremely complicated ensemble work that sounds very similar to some of the music that was coming out of the English progressive rock scene at the time.  Although there are solos on this lengthy track, they are really very interesting and are seamlessly integrated with the arrangement - in fact, they sound pre-composed.\n\nAlthough it may not appear to be the case, this Verve release was remastered (albeit a low budget remaster), and the sound quality is very good.  There are a few photos of the band and a lengthy bit of \"cosmic\" verse from Neville Potter.  The imagery of the words is both colorful and evocative.\n\nAll in all this is an excellent RTF album (my \"new\" personal favorite) and is very highly recommended along with Romantic Warrior (1976).  Proggers should definitely check this album out.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"It is hard to believe that it has been 3 years since Michael Jackson tragically died. Yet, his music remains in vivid memory as he was still alive today. Something that only few and far between artists whom has passed on can still deliver in spirit. His last major hit, You Rock My World from his lackluster Invincible record still remains very solid with his standard dance songs from the late 70's and 80's. It is one of his better songs from Invincible that still stands tall. While it isn't as good as his ballads were like Man In The Mirror or Lady In My Life. Still, it holds up well into why he will always be The King Of Pop. He knew what he wanted in song and heart. The song still stands taller than most of the junk on radio today.\n\nSong: B","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I read all the reviews and mine is about the music, It has really everything you need in one place for \"Almost\" all the tracks for a box set. It misses a few titles available on other releases but really, its trivial as far as I'm concerned. Just a quick note, this is not a real expensive box set, try the last \"Moody Blues\" set, anyway, if you really want a box with most of the \"Works\", this is the box to get, if you want to sample their work, try one of the numerous \"Best Of\" collections of the band. So not to repeat what many have said, it is the set with best tracks as well as the albums (Cut The C*ap is missing), rare tracks etc. Sure, has lots of stuff in the box that has some \"Bells & Whistles\" but all box sets have many of the same things included. So in conclusion, if you want it, get it, if not, don't because of the price is too high or missing some track you think it should have had included. I collect their work is why I got it, your reason may be different. It is the music in the end that is important.\nDrop by my website sometime & look around at \"JudeMac Forever\", something is their for everyone. google it.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"\"Stay the Night\" by Benjamin Orr of the Cars is his most notable solo hit. It has a cool soothing vibe that was most popular during the eighties. For some reason, I can always picture this song being blasted out of numerous car stereos during the 1980's on those moonlit Friday and Saturday night dates. It's definitely slower and a bit more poppy than much of the other Cars stuff that he's known for...I'm not sure if that was by design or trying to fit into the cornucopia of music that comprised the 1980's. The more I listen to the song, I realize that there's something dark and slightly creepy about this song maybe its' the sound like crickets chirping in the background or the low hum in the background that sounds like human breathing. It really doesn't matter though because it's so eighties and I love it.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"John Legend is so talented. Alot of people look at this album as a cop-out because he took a more contemparary R&B approach, as apposed to his previous two albums where he did more soul and light rock music. But honestly, i don't look at it like that at all. I feel like this album really shows how versatile of artist John really is. Evolver shows that he can do those beautiful piano tinged track like \"Ordinary People\" and the gorgeous \"This Time\" from Evolver, but he can also do the radio grooves like the super contagious and super catchy \"Green Light\", which has become his biggest hit to date. Alot of people ruled Evolver out right after they heard \"Green Light\", because without a doubt, John Legend has never done a song like that before. \"Green Light\" is the first John Legend song that belongs on the radio. It has some great and misty production from up and coming producer Maylay, of course it has the sultry classic John Legend vocals that everyone loves, and to top it all off, Andre 3000 just kills this song. Maylay also produced my favorite track from Evolver, and maybe my favorite John Legend track period, \"Everybody Knows\", which is a beautiful ballad about the pain you feel after losing that someone you love. See a lot of people just assumed that because \"Green Light\" was so radio friendly, that Evolver was gonna sound like an Ne-Yo album or a Chris Brown album, which it did take a different sound than his previous efforts, cuz there are a lot more up beat songs and a lot more songs that were produced with tracks instead of live instruments like his previous albums, which some fans im sure won't appreciate. But he still is John Legend, which pretty much means that your gonna get at least a few songs that are great because John Legend is one of the best R&B\/Soul artists of our time. Evolver definetly has a more contemporary feel than his previous efforts, like on the scorching hot song produced by previous collaborator Will. I.Am, \"Satisfaction\". And then on \"Take Me Away\", he gets Ne-Yo to write him a beautiful song about just falling in love. John sounds SOOO good on \"Take Me Away\", which makes the song that much better. But we still get some of that classic John on tracks like the piano tinged \"This Time\" which pretty much could be called the \"Ordinary People Pt. 2\". And then on the super relaxing and soothing guitar laced \"I Love, You Love\", John really shows why people love him. People love John Legend because he makes people feel good with his gritty vocals. That song along with the sure to be hit song about how to heal a relationship thats falling apart \"Everybody Knows\", are both sure to be fan favorites. And another thing that has Mr. Legend running laps around the other R&B artists of today, is that he has mastered the art of live performances. I finally got to see him live in 09, and he sounds just as amazing, if not better live. It helps that i was fifth row in a already small auditorium at Mystic Lake Casino, but the man just knows how to give his fans a great show. I read in a article not to long ago that was ranking the top artists to see live in concert, and John was towards the top of the list, and now i know why. Overall like i said, Evolver isn't going to win any awards like Get Lifted did, but its still better than 90% of the other R&B albums coming out right now, and thats why i love John Legend, because no matter what, any music from him is guaranteed to be better than most of the junk that floods the air waves right now.\n\nGrade:\nB","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Ry's latest record carries on from where his last, `Pull up some dust and sit down', left off - both lyrically and musically as Ry bemoans the current state of politics in the U.S. in the run up to the forthcoming Presidential election.  Ry came to fame as a supreme `guitar technician' reinterpreting old folk and R&B but his last four records have seen him concentrating on writing his own songs to express his  political views . At times I find these views a bit nave and over-simplified, and in the case of \"Mitt Romney Blues\" and \"Cold cold feeling\" I felt the lyrics were a bit clunky and detracted from the music. However, they are obviously heartfelt and when they work, as in the majority of the songs here, they combine with the music to give added gravitas and grit, with swipes at Sarah Palin, the Tea Party, the N.R.A. and Romney's Latter Day Saints. I don't think that Ry will be voting Republican any time soon!\n\nAgain we have a mix of Guthrie-esque Cannery Row-style folk blues together with harder-edged electric blues, with Ry playing all the instruments himself with just son Joachim helping out on the drums and Arnold McCuller singing harmony vocals on the final track. Indeed I think that Joachim really comes of age here, really driving the up tempo tracks and adding subtle contributions to the more folky songs.  Fans of Ry's electric blues slide guitar will love the rocking \"The Wall Street side of town\", \"Guantanamo\" and \"Kool-Aid\", while \"Cold, cold feeling\" probably has Ry's most bluesy slide for years, very much in the Elmore James style.  The gentle \"The 90 and the 9\" sounds like an out take from \"My name is Buddy\", as does the haunting \"Brother is gone\" and \"Going to Tampa\" has some really nice mandolin, like a throwback to `Paradise and lunch'.\n\nI really liked `Pull up some dust and sit down' and this is almost as good, it was great to hear Ry's blues slide guitar again (both acoustic and electric) even if the music again seems to play second fiddle to the lyrics.  My only criticism is that with 9 tracks clocking it at just over 40 minutes it is a bit short - perhaps Ry should have saved the excellent \"John Lee Hooker for President\" for this album.","classification":5,"fold":7}

My favorite comes from Albert Hammond Jr. who has issued two albums, one better than the other: \"Yours to Keep\" in 2007 and \"Como Te Llama\" in 2008. Now singer-songwriter Julias Casablancas joins the fray and issues his own solo album amidst high expectations.\n\n\"Phrazes For the Young\" (8 tracks; 40 min.) is the classic case of a traditional A and B side to the vinyl album of old. The first 4 songs make up Side A and the opener \"Out of the Blue\" is by far the most commercially sounding track on here, and somewhat reminiscent of the classic Strokes sound of strumming electric guitars. \"Left & Right in the Dark\" and \"11th Dimension\" also are quite pleasant to the ear. Side A concludes with a pensive \"4 Cords of the Apocalypse\". As the next 4 song cycle gets underway, it made me realize that the further you go along in the album, the less and less it sounds like the Strokes, so for anyone expecting a Strokes album in all-but-name, save your money and don't buy this. Side B starts with a strangely mesmerizing \"Ludlow St.\", bringing a hotchpotch of sounds with brass, Eastern influences and more, but somehow it works great. \"River of Brakelights\" and \"Glass\" continues the now-ever stranger journey with yet more enticing musical adventures. By the time we get to the closing track \"Tourist\", a mid-tempo track with gorgeous musical layering that feels like a catharsis. It is my second favorite track on the album and a great way to close out the album.\n\nDon't make too much about there \"only\" being 8 tracks on here. They are all around the 5 min. mark, and I never felt that this was a \"Strokes-like\" short album. In a recent music magazine interview of Casablancas, I read that he has high hopes for mainstream-commercial success for this album, which truly surprised me, I mean, really?. I can see one track, tops, getting some commercial radio airplay, and even that is doubtful, given the sorry state of commercial radio. Not that this reflects poorly on this album, not at all. If you are not looking for a carbon-copy Strokes-like album, I venture you will be very pleasantly surprised. I know I certainly have been.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"When it has came down to Mariah Carey, she hasn't been able to strike that nail on the head with her music lately. The songs on her latest album, Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel have been very weak, from start to finish, and haven't been able to click to fans as much as her prior records. Her first single from her album, Obsessed, feels a bit overdone. It honestly is a very weak and dormid song for Mariah, compared to her more upbeat R&B and Pop hits from her earlier records, like It's Like That and Honey. I wasn't as impressed at all. I think Mariah needs to find a better sound for herself as a whole for her next album, because it just isn't really the obsession her fans should've gotten. Hopefully, Mariah will do much better in Precious when it does come out next month.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":7}

Tweedy are a father\/son duo comprising Jeff Tweedy (of Wilco) on vocals and guitar and his teen son Spencer on drums.\n\n\"Sukierae\" is an album of melancholic Folk\/Rock with dashes of psychedelia. A double album of 20 tracks, everything is beautiful and makes for compulsive listening, from the cleverly titled messy-sounding garage rocker \"Please Don't Let Me Be So Understood\", the dark \"Diamond Light Pt. 1\" (with clattery percussion, a creepy piano riff and ghostly effects, with Jeff singing \"Are you scared? are you frightened? Terrified of being alone?\"), the tender acoustic \"Pigeons\", the experimental \"Slow Love\" (with gently crashing beats, eerie effects and a pseudo Jazz feel), \"Nobody Dies Anymore\" (with its wall of Ooohs), the upbeat \"I'll Sing It\" (with catchy Yeah yeah yeahs), \"Where My Love\" (with lovely piano breaks), and closing cut \"I'll Never Know\", with tenderly plucked guitars and accidental-sounding horns.\n\nInspired by Jeff's wife's battle with cancer, the album is named after her (Sukierae is her nickname), It's a beautiful collection.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"It's surprising how many classic Christmas LPs have never been re-mastered for conversion to CD, none more so than Christmas Carols by Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra which first came out in 1958 as mono Dot 3148 containing: White Christmas; It Came Upon A Midnight Clear; O Holy Night; Deck The Halls; The First Noel; Joy To The World; Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful); Silent Night; God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen; O Tannenbaum (O Christmas Tree); Hark! The Herald Angels Sing; Faith Of Our Fathers; Jingle Bells; O Little Town Of Bethlehem.\n\nOver the years with subsequent reissues there were 3 different covers with the original having a mostly yellow cover and a stylized drawing of a sleigh inside a large red oval (which made it a bit odd in that Sleigh Ride itself was not among the tracks). In 1959 the same album came out in stereo (Dot 3148\/25148), with a glossy front cover, \"Billy Vaughn\" in white on a green background and gold-embossed \"Christmas Carols\" on red, with a gold embossed border. When re-issued again a few years later the cover was a flat red, the \"Dot\" logo in its usual 3 colors situated in a green circle, \"Billy Vaughn\" in white and \"Christmas Carols\" in yellow. Charting-wise it made it to # 145 on Billboard's Christmas charts in 1962 and # 101 in 1967.\n\nSome of the tracks have appeared on these CDs: Christmas With Billy Vaughn & His Yuletide Orchestra - 9 of the same tracks in a 10-track 2006 release that includes Auld Lang Syne; Christmas Classics, a 1996 release from Chicago Music Company that contains the same 10 sides; and Christmas Song, a 2012 release from Essential Media Group containing the same line-up. None of these include God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen or White Christmas, nor can I say with any certainty that they are all the same original 1958 renditions.\n\nWhy that has never been re-mastered for CD is a puzzle since Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra wasn't just some run-of-the-mill band back then. After being part of the highly-successful Dot vocal quartet known as The Hilltoppers, who had 15 hit singles for the label from 1952 to 1954, he left to form the in-house Dot orchestra in 1954 that would go on to back the vast majority of Dot artists on so many hit singles and albums (e.g. Pat Boone, Gail Storm, The Fontane Sisters, Tab Hunter, Nick Todd (Pat Boone's brother), and many more for years to come.\n\nIn the midst of all that, he and his orchestra would rack up some 31 hit singles of their own from their first, Melody Of Love in late 1954\/early 1955, to their last in 1967, I Love You (And You Love Me), while selling albums in the millions, 4 of which went Gold: The Golden Instrumentals (1956); Sail Along Silv'ry Moon (1958); Blue Hawaii (1959); and Theme From A Summer Place (1960).\n\nA great deal of his music is available on CD, so why are they dragging their heels with his premier Christmas album?","classification":5,"fold":7}

Beyonce' Knowles pulling a surprise record to the music industry, well has had a lot of wasted songs that hasn't delivered from the soul of the heart.

Partition from the album has honestly bee one of the weaker songs from the album. She didn't really give it her all in a song trying to be more sexy to her man on the outside, than being a trophy overall. I just didn't find the song to absolutely impress.

{"text":"Why would someone with my musical tastes,even in rock n roll be interested in a new release by Rick Springfield? The answer is that I've always appreciate his devotion to rock song craft and survivability of well constructed guitar based pop\/rock. That goes all the way back to the \"Jesse's Girl\" days of course. In the last decade or so Springfield has revived his career,making a serious of comebacks that are welcomed with a good degree of positive support. Because in terms of rock music Rick seems to adhere to an outlook that says it's more important to stick to ones own guns than follow any sort of particular trend (although in his heyday his style of pop\/rock was somewhat trendy),I did have a level of excitement about the release of his new album. Felt it was even appropriate to change a few things to accommodate the modern era. Personally? There are some things about this album I feel just were not the best way for Rick to accomplish that.\n\n  To start with there are some excellent songs here that,if the general album had stuck around that area,might've had a bit more to it.  \"Our Ship's Sinking\",\"I Hate Myself\",the acoustic flavored \"Gabriel\",\"Joshua\" and the closing \"One Way Street\" are five of the most captivating guitar based pop\/rock songs I've heard come out of Rick-very much in his classic sound if very heavily produced to accommodate contemporary listeners. On a personal level some of these songs such as \"A Sign Of Life\",\"Depravity\" and to some extent the opener \"Wide Awake\" embrace some of the guttural singing and overly loud and enraged,overly noisy guitar sound of the grunge rock era. Never much cared for how radio and critics tended to use that genre and alternative rock in general to smother over...well rock music of the kind Rick Springfield once specialized in. To me it's a cliche. And I really can't understand why Rick of all people would embrace that sound. If it's your kind of thing though,these songs will be just for you.\n\n  On this special addition the bonus songs more than make up for anything I saw as weak on the album with another excellent guitar based pop\/rocker in \"Let Me In\" as well as two demos \"Lust\" and \"Her Body Makes Vows\". With their classy production and use of echo and light electronic effects,they are full on 80's era Rick Springfield. Yes I feel that's the sound that made him and yes,I find much to value in that sound even today. There's also an excellent and like minded live rendition of Wings' classic \"Jet\". It's the type of version where it almost seems as if Paul McCartney wrote it for Rick Springfield. No contest that songs like that inspired his sound though. Though I must admit,my personal dislike of grunge and the controversially disintegrating sociological effect on the world around me did prevent me from giving this album a fully positive review,it's got a lot more going for it than not. And the best of it is,as they say,five star melodic pop\/rock all the way.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"The catchy radio-sensation is a quite interesting listen, and it really speaks the the artistic integrity and under-lying political side of Mr. Mayer. Why the strange chorus? Well if Mayer sung \"We're going to change, we're going to change the world,\" he figured that the listener would be like, \"Yeah, I'm going to change this station.\" But as is, it's a call for change, and speaks more directly with more impact. The listener then identifies with the song, and is like, \"Yeah, that's how I feel!\" And this is by no means an anti-war track as some have made it to be. If he is anti-war, it's not explicitly stated in the least bit, in this song. This is a change track, to which I wonder where I could fit an Obama reference in here or there, or somewhere\/anywhere.\n\nCap all this off with some ultra catchy vibes floating around, and more great guitar work, and you got a true winner. I'm just amazed the radio crowd embraced it so much. I guess all hope is not lost.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"First of all, let me say that I have always thought that Kanye West was\/is a complete and total jackass. From his \"George Bush hates black people\" comment to his brazen disrespect of Taylor Swift FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER, I have always turned away from the guy, both on radio and on TV. People who present themselves in such a manner are simply are not permitted in my reality. CLICK: you're gone. And when people present themselves as stupidly as Kanye West has managed to present himself these past few years, I CLICK really, REALLY fast.\n\nHowever....\n\nI now think that I might have been a little hasty in writing the guy off.\n\nKanye West has a style of writing that is, almost by definition, schizophrenic (schizos unite concepts by means of non-essentials; I remember reading that one schizoid actually stood in front of a Judge and said that a beach was like a cigar because of some crazy definition of \"encirclement\" that made perfect sense to him, the schizo. The sentences formed by the guy, literally, made no sense whatsoever.) Kanye West adopts this as a sort of poetic style -- which in the hands of most folks would be an invitation to poetic disaster -- and yet he finds ways to make it work.\n\nIt's really, really interesting what he's doing, here.\n\nWithin a work of art, schizoid flavoring occasionally does create very powerful effects - particularly within the context of visual metaphor -- or via lyrics that employ the description thereof. There's a Pearl Jam video out there somewhere that has all sorts of random non-essentials thrown into the imagery (34 degrees, partly cloudy) and the effect is masterful. I don't have a name for this, but whatever it's called, Kanye West gets it, and gets it completely. He takes it just far enough, and no farther. He does it right. (Too, in what sounds like D-flat Major, the key itself gives the track a bit of a schizzy feel.)\n\n\"I slapped my girl, she called the feds\nI did that time, and spent that bread\nI'm heading home, I'm almost there\nI'm on my way, heading up the stairs\nTo my surprise, a n-gga replacing me\nI had to take 'em to that ghetto university...\"\n\nKanye then inserts a FEMALE voice here, who sings:\n\n\"All of the lights...\nCop lights, flash lights, spot lights\nStrobe lights, street lights\n(all of the lights, all of the lights)\nAll of the lights (all of the lights)\n(Lights, lights)\nAll of the lights (all of the lights)\"\n\nThink about this for a moment, and consider how well this works. A conceptual focus on non-essentals is exactly what Ayn Rand would have called a non-objective epistemology - which it IS, no question about that - but observe the artistic power of this. Kanye creates some compelling imagery, here; violence presented via metaphor (ghetto university) - the verse creates the situation, while the Female voice then arrives with the chorus and presents LAW ENFORCEMENT via a conceptual non-essential dressed-up as metaphor.\n\n\"All of the lights...\nCop lights, flash lights, spot lights\nStrobe lights, street lights\n(all of the lights, all of the lights)\nAll of the lights (all of the lights)\n(Lights, lights)\nAll of the lights (all of the lights)\"\n\nKanye West is showing some incredibly unique poetic skills, here. I don't know what this is called (it's not free verse (welllll... not really)), but whatever it is, it certainly is NOT iambic pentameter. It's nothing out of the textbook. You won't find what Kanye is doing here listed as a style in the Oxford Guide To Poetry. Kanye seems to have his own rulebook on what poetry is, and if you want my opinion, it's very cool.\n\nKanye continues:\n\n\"Restraining order\nCan't see my daughter\nHer mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order\nPublic visitation\nWe met at Borders\nTold her she take me back\nI'll be more supportive\nI made mistakes\nI bump my head\nCourts suck me dry\nI spent that bread\nShe need a daddy\nBaby please, can't let her grow up in that ghetto university....\"\n\nObserve that Kanye is ASKING the girl, he is not TELLING HER HOW IT IS. Look at his word choice; he's asking PERMISSION. He's PLEADING.\n\nThe Female voiced then responds with a thinly-veiled threat:\n\n\"Turn up the lights in here baby\nExtra bright, I want y'all to see this\nTurn up the lights in here, baby\nYou know what I need\nWant you to see everything\nWant you to see all of the lights....\"\n\nIn other words, the Female voice is saying, in metaphor, that she has law enforcement on her side - pay attention to the word choice: \"want you to see everything, want you to see all of the lights.\"\n\nLook at this as a whole work - see the song WHOLE:\n\nMale voice presents: Violence\nFemale voice responds: All of the lights (law enforcement)\nMale voice presents: I need to see my daughter\nFemale voice responds: All of the lights (law enforcement)\n\nObserve how this is all done: via metaphor. Literally every reference to lights in the song is a reference to law enforcement.\n\n\"If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life,\" sings the Female voice - to a guy who has just said that \"I did that time\" and that the \"courts suck me dry.\" Heh... I don't know the back-story on this, but I can probably guess.\n\nLook, I'm not familiar with much of Kanye's West's music - and I'm gonna go ahead and get that handled here on my end. This is a master craftsman; this is what music is when it gets created by somebody who has something to say and knows exactly how to say it. Lyrically, Kanye breaks all of the rules here. The final result, however... is absolutely INSPIRED.\n\nIt's a rap OPERA, and it's sublime.\n\n5 stars, no question.\n\nThis is EXCEPTIONAL. This is some of the most original, unique, creative, and BRILLIANT work to find airplay in YEARS.\n\n(I almost expected to hear a young girl's voice at the end, asking Mommy and Daddy to turn off all the lights -- in other words, to get their nonsense HANDLED so that she can have a childhood. Songs that even lead you to think such things (to re-interpret something within them) are a rare breed these days, and I'll take all of it that I can get.)\n\nAbsolutely brilliant.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Reigning from Washington D.C., Oddisee is an example of a rare breed of rappers who doesn't sacrifice his art of substantial music for pop irrelevance. \"The Good Fight\" is a nice collection of informative and uplifting music. From the Oddisee's textured lyrics to the immaculate soul and funky production, this is an album that is meticulously put together from start to finish with no filler tracks in sight. From self appreciated \"No Love\" all the way to the reflective \"Worse Before Better\" this album is just amazing. Another comment that should be mentioned is that fact that there is no unnecessary use the \"N\" \"F\" or \"B\" word which is a accomplishment in today's world of Hip Hop. I cannot praise this album without sounding redundant, but this is definitely in my top 5  Hip Hop albums of the year right next to Kendrick Lamar's \"To Pimp and Butterfly\" and Lupe Fiasco's \"Tetsuo & Youth\".\n\nFavorite 5\n1) Counter-Clockwise\n2) First Choice\n3) Contradiction's Maze\n4) Want Something Done\n5) Book Covers\n\nDo yourself a favor and support this mans music!","classification":5,"fold":7}

This is one of those works. \"My Dick\" is nothing but pure crass comic genius. It doesn't sample the tracks of songs far greater than it, it doesn't labor to spin some BS thug life fable, nor does it try to be anything other than what it is. What it acomplishes is laying down old school rap with only one concern; busting out awesome rhymes, and doing so in fantastic comedic fashion.

{"text":"I recently saw Elle King in concert for the first time (more on that later). I admit that I really didn't know all that much about her before I saw her live show. Of course I had heard \"Ex's & Oh's\", a great single, reminding me of Adele, never a bad thing. It is the big hit of this, Elle King's debut album (released last year).\n\n\"Love Stuff\" (12 tracks; 42 min.) opens with the wickedly funny \"Where the Devile Don't Go\", which is followed by the hit single \"Ex's & Oh's\". \"Under the Influence\" continues the pop-smart sounds. \"Last Damn Night\" is an outright rocker, yes! Side A closer \"Song of Sorrow\" does not sound sorrowful at all. Side B opens with the other hit, \"America's Sweetheart\", another highlight on the album. The off-center \"I Told You I Was Mean\" reminds me of Amy Winehouse to an extent, but the lyrics are Elle King through and through (the song opens with \"I lied to you\/I never cried for you\/I swear that I tried to\/But I had better things to do\", and that's just for starters... wow). \"Jackson\" is another hard-charging rocker. The album closes with the only introspective tune on here, \"See You Again\", just Elle and her acoustic guitar. What a way to finish things off!\n\nI recently saw Elle in concert at the rapidly growing Bunbury Music Festival here in Cincinnati. She played an early evening set before a massive crowd, obviously playing mostly from this album, but surprisingly not \"America's Sweetheart\". But it's a minor quibble. Her set was simply amazing. Elle switched from guitar to banjo back to guitar, and live is sounds a lot less \"pop\" than on the album and a whole lot more rough and down to earth. Elle reminded the crowd that she hails from Ohio originally (albeit the eastern portion), and the crowd roared in approval. If you have a chance to see her in concert, do not miss her! Meanwhile, \"Love Stuff\" is a strong debut album for sure.","classification":4,"fold":7}

Also I've seen a couple videos where he was singin' acappela and was just blown away. I go through so much music so sometimes it takes me a minute to get around to really listening to something. I took the time to actually listen to this album before I bought it. I've learned to do that instead of buying something and end up disappointed. I am very impressed with this guys progression. Most artists end up in a situation where they're always trying to out do their last album. With Jeremih it just seems to get better and better. I hope he's around in this business for a long long time. This album just makes me want to hear more of him. I think I got through the 3rd track when previewing this and said o.k. I'm buying it. I'd put Jeremih up there wit Trey Songz right now. What's even more amazing is this guy composes his own music and lyrics. I don't know if all tracks on this album are 100% done by him but even if they aren't this album is still worth every penny.

{"text":"It's a strange scenario when within a short time of each other we had two female fronted hard rawk bands from Scandinavia sally forth with full length nuggets of road worn wisdom. I'm of course referencing the relatively short space of time betwixt the release of Vanity Inks `More Senseless Random Behaviour' and this album from Sister Sin.\n\nAnd to tell the truth both bands are playing much within the same ballpark. Both have produced solid second albums that stay very much within their remit of playing tight party rock sliding into more formal metallic realms at times. Both have somewhat charismatic female lead singers and both are quite obviously inspired at least in part by all the great party wattage from the harder end of the 80's musical spectrum. If one were to split hairs it has to be said that Sister sin are the more metallic, their sonic attack that touch harsher, the vocals of Liv being more barren sounding, more visceral and less in possession of self awareness of the inherent clichs within the lyrics, if that makes sense.\n\nAll up this is a very full sounding album sonically, pretty much everything is louder than anything else. The whole album pretty much careens into one and many of the tunes themselves seem just about ready to collapse in a rather elegantly wasted manner. A little like the audio equivalent of the huge fender benders one sees on TV where 75 vehicles have all piled into each other - and yeah I'm meaning that as a compliment. A few studio trick are used here and there and the whole thing sounds crystal clear. Lyrics are not included in the booklet alas though it has to be said that they are probably not the strong point of this album. Then again as long as you attack the task at hand with the right amount of vigour then much can be forgiven. And the Udo Dirkschneider penned cover song.... hearing a female vocalist attack such a number was.... interesting.\n\nEleven tracks, plenty of meat on the bone with little or no fat. A very strong four star album and I can understant the five star reviews. A CD well suited to your next bout of self destructive behaviour.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I'm one of the rare Sevendust fans who doesn't buy the Cubs\/White Sox-like dichotomy that you can only like Sonny Mayo's or Clint Lowery's guitarwork. This is Sonny's final album with Sevendust, and it is for the most part excellent.\n\nThat said, too much attention goes to the Sonny\/Clint thing. John Connolly is an excellent guitarist by any standard, and Vinnie Hornsby on bass is utterly insane in the best bassist kind of way.  While Morgan Rose's powerful drumming and backing vocals and Lajon Witherspoon's sometimes-raging sometimes-gentle vocals often take center stage, John and Vinnie together form the solid sinews of each song, whether with Sonny, Clint or any of their guest instrumentalists. That kind of flexibility for a rhythm duo should not be passed up.\n\nTo the album itself:\n\"Chapter VII\" is the most brooding and mood-changing album since \"Animosity\". It reflects the band's maturity and that they are consummate artists - something that may not be appreciated by fans who stopped listening after the viciously good \"Home\" or who didn't tune in until the mainstream-friendly but deliciously experimental \"Seasons\".\n\nWhere \"Alpha\" was pure aggression (listening to the title song is like kickboxing on four shots of espresso), \"Chapter VII\" remains agitated but is consciously brooding and sometimes defiant.\n\n\"Inside\" is an awesome opening track (though I would have put \"Enough\" later in the album, since it shares the same energy and made me wonder whether they were two movements on the same theme). I can picture the lights slowly coming up as Morgan's drumming agitates further to the driving guitar crescendos, followed by Lajon's terse argument and his more melodic self-rebuttal as John, Vinnie and Sonny blend into a tempo change that at once foretells and anticipates the complex harmony at the core of the song.\n\n\"Hope\" is, ironically, the darkest song on the album, though Mark Tremonti's guitar work adds a stunning narrative that makes me wonder if the band will tap him if Lowery takes on another project. There's something in the pacing of \"Scapegoat\" that doesn't seem to mesh as well with other tracks; \"Prodigal Son\" is the opposite - strongly driven by Lajon's own vocal rhythm. \"Lifeless\" and \"Walk Away\" are both masterful and let each member of the band shine - blends of minor and power chords, alternatingly intense and soulful drumming, shifting bass lines that both lead and drive the melody, and Lajon's incredibly expressive range.\n\nIn short, \"Chapter VII\" is an excellent album that, while not as singles-friendly as \"Animosity\" or \"Next\", holds together in a cohesion that good albums should and rare albums do.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"There is no question about how Michael Jackson had to follow up his monster album Thriller with his Bad record; While Bad wasn't as strong as Thriller in sales, it did have some great songs to follow in stride. But very rare there is one without the theme of being a perfectionist in video. I Just Can't Can't Stop Loving You, the duet with Sieda Garett, whom co-wrote Man In The Mirror is one of those songs that still sounds irresistible to the heart and the ears for anyone that is a hard core fan of Michael Jackson. Surprisingly, the duet was suppose with be with legend Whitney Houston in heart, but didn't actually go as planned because of other things. But this is one song you can definitely enjoy without him being too much demand as a singer, or what Michael was able to accomplish without fault of his legacy.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":7}

But actually, in Brazil, the Bossa Nova fever never did quite cool off and in '72, when I was visiting family there, this album was still trotted out proudly at every gathering.\nNot only is this album a great party CD for \"retro\" parties, relaxed evenings or just sitting at home and relaxing, but it introduces you to the greats of Brazilian music. Oh, there is a whole lot more great Brazilian music than just this, but this album is surely the place to start.  (By the way, if you have insomnia, this can be quite soothing.

{"text":"I recently discovered Audiomachine through my love of soundtrack music.  It was recommended through Amazon after purchasing other soundtrack items and I am glad I gave it a listen.  From my understanding, this is the music that is sometimes used in trailer music for both movies and video games.  Each piece is just perfect and unique in a special way.  They can be epic, action packed, futuristic, mysterious, and emotional.  It is easy to see how each of these can be used for the various trailers that they are sometimes created for.  It is amazing that Audiomachine can come up with some many great tracks.  I've since bought all of their other albums and they seem to never run out of creative ideas.  One of the things that I've always loved about soundtrack music is that it gives me the ability to close my eyes and create my own movie.  Each of these tracks has that same power.  They can each be a different adventure each time.  Great music to write to.  All of their albums are just wonderful and I highly recommend them.  Some of my favorite tracks from this particular album are Sol Invictus and Farewell to Earth.  Get these...you won't be disappointed!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"The final release in 2012 from the \"Dave's Picks\" series (Williamsburg, Va * 9\/24\/76) was a most excellent show with many highlights and while folks were still able to score that goldmine of a show word appeared from cyber-deadland that the Pauley Pavillion show of 11\/17\/73 was next up to bat and as I thought Dave was real good at what he was doing this new release shows he has listened to us and knows just what we want.\n\nWhen I first met Grateful Dead tape traders live and in person in Virginia back in the early 1980's the Pauley Pavillion show of November 1973 was mentioned as a must-have tape by two of the first three traders I met. Stuff like: \"For a band that lives for the moment, this show sounds like the band was reheasing for a week prior to this\" and \"You might think they overdubed the entire show - It's TOO perfect\" were spoken and I wondered just how in the world could you get studio overdubs on a live tape from an audience cassette. Was this possible in this strange world of Grateful Dead live tapes (and even stranger people!)\n\nWell, I ended up with three tapes of the second set of this night and they all started with \"Playing In The Band\" and those tapes would end before that entire 50 minute sequence was over as they were always on 45 minute a-side cassettes and I never did hear just how that spacey Playing reprise ended but getting past the crowd noises it was easy to hear just how \"on\" the band was in Los Angeles on this night. The vocals are as great as any official \"Europe 72\" versions and next to nobody had ever heard The Grateful Dead sing and play this well anywhere else (Heck, Donna doesn't even mess this one up!) I never came across a tape of the first set from this night on trader's lists but after playing CD one from this set over the past few days I sure wish I had as there is a a killer \"Here Comes Sunshine\" with a \"China Cat>Rider\" and \"Brown Eyed Woman\" that are as great as those songs can be played and this is one of the best first sets of Grateful Dead music to ever appear on a CD and it only took 30 years for me to hear it.\n\nWell, the second set shows that the energy level is way off the ground and a different drumbeat is featured in \"Row Jimmy\" and I really enjoy what Billy is playing this night on his kit and if anyone doubts his abilities as a great drummer this set shows he elevates the music up higher with much swing and sometimes big power and as Jerry is plays so many great runs I could hear Billy, Keith and Phil loud and clear on this collection as this isn't from an audience source tape any longer and if this is a two-track master I say thank you as it is a great mix that (for my ears) only leaves Bobby's guitar hard to hear in spots but there is great clarity and separation found on this set and I wonder that if it was played on the Wall Of Sound in 1974 it could have made heads explode as this is indeed very powerful stuff.\n\n\"Playing\" is the third song on disc two and this is where the fun really starts as the jams are unreal and you can forget about gravity as this beast is heading for Jupiter and the music is indeed playing the band for the next 50 minutes as \"Playing\" melts into \"Uncle John's Band\" and that drops perfectly into \"Morning Dew\" that keeps building and building and right before Jerry sings the final line of \"Dew\" it's fuses perfectly back into the coda of \"Uncle John's\" and has another fine jam building that bleeds right back into a more cosmic finish of \"Playing.\" Yeah, it only took 30 years but, now I get to hear this entire sequence of music without a tape-cut before the end of \"Playing In The Band.\" This is magical stuff and I'm very impressed by how well it has been presented here.\n\nDisc three is almost like a coda to the first set as it's back to songs played perfectly and with much more punch than you have heard them before and Bobby gets to sing his fourth Cowboy song of the night with a late appearance of \"El Paso\" and get's to scream out the set closer \"Sugar Magnolia.\" The encore? Well, it's gotta be \"Casey Jones\" and it's time to ride that train home as this 3 hour plus concert is now over.\n\n13,000 of these sets were produced and 13,000 have already been sold...I hope you didn't miss out!\nFIVE STARS!!!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Prime Cuts: Shout for Joy, Little Drummer Boy, O Holy Night (Another Hallelujah)\n\nLincoln Brewster is a trailblazer.  \"Joy to the World,\" Brewster's eighth album, is further evidence that this Arkansas native would not be bound by the sonic restrains of Contemporary Christian Music's genre.  Though this album is marketed as a Christmas project, it is far from what one would expect from the copious festive offerings out there.  Pushing the envelope to include a rap praise shout, a showy orchestral display of instrumental carol montage, a couple of worship classics donned with Christmas garb, and a few electrified rock offerings of traditional carols, Brewster shows that Christmas songs are more than just sleigh bells jingled muzak.  Further, in the dictum of many music reviewers, Brewster bears a striking resemblance to country star Keith Urban. Just like Urban who could successfully cross pollinate genres satisfying his country fans without alienating those accustomed to pop music, Brewster has a way of connecting the traditionalists who want a religiously unwavering rendition of the carols as well as those who want a more contemporary flair.  Like the country artist, Brewster would not let a track go by without some display of his virtuoso as a guitarist. And vocally both gentlemen have a gift of bending their light distinctive tenor to a populist utility.  The only difference being that Urban would stuff his catalog with bedroom ballads and open-highway tunes while Brewster's is unabashedly worship centric with God at the cynosure.\n\nMost interesting in this corpus of songs is the way Brewster gives a couple of regular worship anthems a Christmas reading.  The first of which is the Paul Baloche, Jason Ingram and Brewster co-write \"Shout for Joy\"--a track lifted out of Brewster's previous album \"Real Life.\"  A Christmas makeover for this worship ballad is observed by its chiming bells, stirring keyboard and a newly written Christmas verse added to this ode of joyous praise to the coming of the Savior.  Arguably the best rendition of Chris Tomlin's hugely popular \"Our God\" is by Hillsong's matriarch Darlene Zschech when she led a powerful rendition of it this year at Hillsong's annual conference in Australia.  In an effort to commemorate the season, the only notable amendment was for Brewster to tag on the line \"O Come Let Us Adore Him\" to the bridge.  Considering Brewster's love to improvise, one would have wished that more was done to morph the song into a festive worship chorus.\n\nBrewster really pushes the envelope with \"Little Drummer Boy.\"  With thrilling rock guitar riffs, hip hop drum beats and a rap by KJ-52, \"Little Drummer Boy\" becomes a delightful potpourri of genres coming together in giving glory to the baby Jesus.  \"Miraculum,\" on the other hand, overturns all expectations again.  An over six minute instrumental medley of \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,\" \"O Come O Come Emmanuel\" and \"Carol of the Bells,\" this song finds Brewster at his finest moment with his finest guitar work at the fore backed by a beautiful orchestra.  Another uncharacteristic move is to tag \"O Holy Night\" with Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah.\"  On paper, it might not seem to work.  But on record, Cohen's \"Hallelujah\" actually adds a worshipful response to the glorious work of Jesus Christ starting at his birth proclaimed in the hymn \"O Holy Night.\"\n\nThe Keith Urban connection is the strongest on album opener \"Joy to the World.\"  A jaunty guitar driven rocker with flashes of country rock, \"Joy to the World\" reminds us in glowingly holiness that though our world is filled with destruction and sin \"he (Jesus) (still) rules the world with truth and grace.\" Brewster shows us again and again through his trailblazing ways that Christmas is about Jesus.  He is our joy even though wrong may seem to triumphant and evil may seem prevalent.  And this disc is perfect soundtrack for us to utilize this Christmas to worship Him and thank Him for Jesus truly is our unspeakable joy.","classification":5,"fold":7}

But I'll just say that I've been listening to Richard Thompson since the late 1970s and own a few dozen of his albums, and consider him one of music's greatest treasures. And to the point: This new album ranks with the best of his many fine albums.\n\nAlso no need to give a track-by-track breakdown, but there are MANY fine moments on this album (the first disc produced by Jeff Tweedy, and the second disc --- more of an EP --- produced by RT himself) that will please longtime fans of this amazing artist. Yes, he's a talented guitar player with a very distinctive style, but I've always been more impressed with his songwriting chops. This guy can write some killer songs, and there are plenty to savor here. Listening to this new set of songs, there is a familiarity to the tone and the texture of the music, yet nothing feels regurgitated or forced.

Coldplay however has held it together the way bands like U2, DMB, REM, and many other greats have.\n\nA few of the songs took a couple times of listening to get them, and into them, and now I have no song I don't like on the CD.\n\nIf you think this is a muddy poor cd, turn off your cheapo boombox, and get something worth listening to.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I stumbled upon \"100 Must-Have Bach Masterpieces\" while browsing the digital music section at Amazon.com. I was a bit surprised to see that this MP3 album's track listing on its Amazon web page does not show the performing artists' names on well over half the listed tracks, and the few names that are shown I have never heard of before. I thought it best to give this album a \"try-before-I-buy\" listen before committing even a couple of bucks to its purchase. I am glad I did.\n\nThis may be the worst compilation of music by Johann Sebastian Bach I have ever heard. The 100 tracks selected for this album are alright, although they only cover 25 different Bach compositions and therefore don't give a particularly well-rounded picture of the immense depth and breadth of Bach's incredible genius. The biggest problem, however, is the dated musicianship on the album.\n\nEvery one of the selections is played too slowly, and every performance is flat, lifeless, and dull. Allegro (quick) movements, especially in the Brandenburg Concerto, Orchestral Suite, piano concerto, and violin concerto selections, are played at a nearly Andante (moderately slow) pace, and Andante movements are played at close to a Largo (very slow) tempo.  Choral pieces fare no better. Choruses and solo vocalists, while technically competent, sing with little of the artistry  found in the best Bach recordings. I found the selections from both the \"St. Matthew Passion\" and St. John Passion\" especially lethargic and monotonous.\n\nThere are far better compilations of Bach's music that are performed by world-class musicians who infuse their performances with energy, passion, and tremendous artistry. Two such particularly praiseworthy albums are&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Essential-Bach-2CDs\/dp\/B000W0B1CO\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Essential Bach (2CDs)<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/50-x-Bach\/dp\/B00P3CEUXS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">50 x Bach<\/a>, both of which are highly enjoyable and very affordable.\n\nBottom line: \"100 Must-Have Bach Masterpieces\" is a non-starter at any price. Not recommended.","classification":1,"fold":7}

About halfway through the record she begins speaking the lyrics as Nino--who was her brother, as I recently found out--sings behind her.

What i am going to do is say how awesome he sounds on Now What?!  The lyrics are great throughout, he sounds like he's having a lot of fun. I really dig him as a lyricist, sometimes funny at times ominous at times bizarre Mr Gillan shines throughout this record that i think is a masterpiece and one of Purple's best.  The rest of the band are merely stunning. Don Airey has really captured Jon Lords epic Organ sound so essential to DP.  The rest of the guys are just fantastic, Roger Glover is one of Rock's best bass players.  AS far as the songs go, there is not one single throwaway on this record, even the bonus track \"It'll be Me\" is a cool tune that holds up to repeated listens.  \"Vincent Price\" is over the Top and so cool i'm almost surprised these guys came up with it at this stage of their career.  The whole record is a real feast for lovers of 70's music.  Out of all the bands\/artsits that came out of the 60's and 70's that have made records late in their careers including, YES, The Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath, McCartney etc. etc. Deep Purple's What Now?! tops them all.

Her latest song from the Prism record also doesn't actually feel like it is anything better. Unconditionally, the second single from her Prism record is actually not worth listening to.

{"text":"There is no question that when it has came down to music, Journey had been the most distinctive in Rock music ballads. But nevertheless, they have been known for so many great songs that are just as strong today as they were back in the 80's. Faithfully, when it came out originally from their record Frontiers in 1983, still is just a beautiful classic. It is simply one of those songs standing tall in simplicity that will never die. Just like Open Arms or Send Her My Love, it really is a excellent song that is a pleasure to listen too. It is definitely a great song worth checking out if you have not even heard a Journey song yet. While they haven't been able to thrive without Steve Perry at heart, Journey will always remain classic for the faithful.\n\nSong: A-","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I paid all of $1.99 for this set of MP3s, and it was well worth it.\n\nThe main attraction here are the symphonies. Recorded by BIS in exceptional sound, and featuring the Swedish Chamber Orchestra under Thomas Dausgaard, this is one of the liveliest Schumann cycles one could ever hope to hear. The tempos are swift throughout, but the playing is crystal clear and does get weighty when needed. Personally, I like an even-weightier account of this music. I like my brass to sound regal, rather than punchy. But one can't deny that the orchestral playing is super, that the choirs are all well balanced, that the voicings are superb and that the musical gestures one expects are made, if at a quicker tempo than one is used to hearing. This is a great cycle for those who find Schumann to be lugubrious or overwrought. None of that here, and a MUCH cheaper way to acquire the cycle than through buying it on CD at $14 a pop.\n\nMajor piano pieces are also included, also in excellent sound.\n\nThe rest of the set is good, though I wonder why the Piano Quintet is absent.\n\nHighly recommended at 10 times the price.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"After the blistering debut Metallica delve further into their psyche, further into their songbook and further into their fiercely traditional yet updated NWOBHM muse. And it's a more difficult metal experience in general, the songs on the debut cutting with a sharper knife whereas the numbers here tend to pound through only after repeated hammering with a blunter instrument. Fight Fire With Fire is perhaps the most similar to the songs of the debut and is the perfectly thought out album opener.\n\nAfter that however the differences start seeping in. Ride The Lightning itself clocks in at over six minutes and I'm not sure it needs it. For Whom the Bell Tolls redeems everything however with it's excellent musical and lyrical assault. The production values on this album seem a little dull, the production credit goes to Metallica and perhaps that's the reason why the album always sounded to me like it was blasting away at me from behind a closed door.\n\nBut the mental imagery the band were playing with on the debut is expanded on this release. The very essence of metal lies within the sinews of songs such as Trapped Under Ice, Creeping Death and the swirling robes of the apparition that is The Call of Ktulu. And the literary references are a nice touch. Speaking as someone who has regularly had to defend metal to his friends (hey, we've all been there), it's refreshing to be able to blow them out of the water with examples of both mindless metal mayhem AND the more educated aspects of it.\n\nAll up I would not recommend this for the total metal novice. There are other more accessable slabs of metal out there. But I would heartily recommend it to any casual fan of the band who wants to explore the earlier stuff. In fact I'd recommend that all hard rock and metal fans accumulate every album this band did from it's debut Kill `Em All through to the black album. If for no other reason than for a useful history lesson regarding the harder end of the music spectrum.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Debrah Bond is a groove artist for the chic set. A consistent presence as a session and background singer in the Washington, DC independent music scene, her voice consistently falls into the pocket and effortlessly rides the modern rhythmic production waves of her atmospheric band, Third Logic. On sublime neo-funk compositions like 5:35 and You are the One, Bond kicks up her heels and parties on musical shores as sophisticated as they are fun. On jazzy electric-soul ballads, Bond coos like an island breeze across string-heavy, percussive neo-80s soundscapes that pulsate with the city sounds of champagne toasts and penthouse living. Throughout these moonlit rides, Bond and her band prove to be thinking musicians with an unfailing sense of maturity, place, and drive.\n\nIt feels liks an age since we last heard from singer\/songwriter Debrah Bond on her 2003 debut, DayAfter, and its standout ballad, Sweet Lullabies. Her alto has grown lighter, surer, and more technically proficient since then. Refined from the ensuing years of supporting a virtual whos who of East Coast indy and mainstream soul from Kem and Ledisi to Frank McComb and Eric Roberson, Bond has come a long way in eight years, leaving fans only a remix of DayAfter to tide them over in the meantime.\n\nAiry voiced with a sultry resonance, on her sophomore project of original tunes, Bond - possessing her still youthful tones - does not always yield the most distinctive vocal presence as a soloist. But, her skill, brilliance, and efficiency is never less than awe-inspiring. The ease of the many transitions on Perfect is a technicians sleight of hand, making the difficult look effortless. Bonds deft hop-scotch handling of the tunes multi-syllabic phrasing and her perceptive nestling in the songs sweet spots making every moment count. In her vocal choices, Bond consistently reveals an intelligence that is understated, but hard to miss. With far less intricacies to maneuver through, she massages Think Twice and Never Was with a breezy beauty that a heavier voice would have made leaden. Her ample experience on backgrounds shines on every harmonic arrangement with voices rivaling Incognito and the Jones Girls on cuts like 5:35. Always appearing to glide over her subtle melodies, Bond is gifted at working hard without ever showing a seam.\n\nIf Bonds skill as a professional songstress wasn't worthy enough of eternal respect, she pulls off the coup of the century by excavating the M.I.A. cult legend Lewis Taylor, who hasn't been heard on a new recording since 2006, and then goes toe-to-toe with the eccentric star for every vocal riff, run and growl. The always pristine-voiced Taylor pulls a ferocity out of Bond on the track that would be nice to hear more of from the usually unflappable chanteuse. Warm and more blood-beating than the albums cooler illustrations, the mid-tempo guitar and percussion bumper is both a tease and a joy, leaving drooling listeners ravenous for more from this thoroughly edible duet.\n\nA cousin to the music of Foreign Exchange minus that band's melodrama, the hybrid Madame Palindrone fuses 90s acid jazz and 80s new age dance music with elements of modern day chillout, lounge, and progressive soul to create a series of briskly paced, though never rushed sonic moving pictures. The lockstep Third Logic musicians sacrifice themselves to mood and tempo, making only the most muted of individual impressions, like the discreet latin percussion and light spectral effects closing Say It or the fleeting bass, violins, and strings accenting Highest Mountain, all to moving effect. It is unobtrusive, atmospheric music that cannot help but light a candle, pour a glass, and set a seductive mood without ever being unseemly. Lyrically sound with less than obvious - but nonetheless compelling - choruses, Bond is more storyteller than hook-meister. Though a lack of singularity plagues Bonds profile as a signature soloist, the overall quality, impressive technique, and humble talent rolling through Madame Palindrone raises Deborah Bond to a circle of other elite, independent ladies whove made strong careers of riding urbane grooves, including: Julie Dexter, Conya Doss, and Amel Larrieux. Welcome to the big leagues, Madame Bond.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"There is so much that I can say about female singer of today, they sincerely do not even come from the heart. With artists like Beyonce' Knowles, Rihanna and others have sincerely sounded more like robots than really a voice that really came from the soul of the heart. For some singers of the past, they have not been able to really have the credit that other songstresses have been able to deliver. Phyllis Hyman has been one of those songstresses that really showed a sophistication and a sheer inner beauty that really was amazing. However, she had never been able to be in the pantheon of the greatest divas like Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin. It is very sad, because she has had some really good albums to her credit, but died very young at the age of 45 years old. She had a lot of great songs and a promising future, but only had one album in her career that had ever went gold or platinum to her credit. This is it.\n\nPrime Of My Life, has been Phyllis Hyman's only album to have ever struck gold or platinum to her recognition. The songs on her 1991 record really bring out a sophistication and a sense of real joy in her life, finding love and a sense of purpose while trying to get past addiction and a feeling that she could not be lonely in her life. The albums is simple and places in her career what Anita Baker had in the 80's with Rapture. The songs really show a nice sentiment in her career and show good and sincerely soulful songs like Prime Of My Life, Living In Confusion, the seductive Meet Me On The Moon, and the upbeat Don't Wanna Change The World. Phyllis really brought out a voice that really brought her out of the 80's and the 90's. While Living All Alone really was a good album that was seductive, she just didn's get that credit. But something out of Phyllis was a sense of sheer R&B. The album might be short and simple, but it does stand up, and sound better than many of today's joke divas.\n\nIt is just so definitely sad that Phyllis Hyman passed away 20 years ago, but at the very end, she had a beautiful legacy of her own that should get more recognition that what has shown. Prime Of My Life really is a good album that really is worth the money. It really brought out one of the best in her of the 90's, just as much as the posthumous I Refuse To Be Lonely did. She really has had a amazing career that is recognized in Philly Soul. I really do wish that people would check this album out, and for this generation really get a listen to a vice that really had something to say, than many of today's joke divas.\n\nAlbum Cover: B\n\nSongs: B+\n\nPrice: B+\n\nMastering: B\n\nOverall: B 1\/2+","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Sometimes I will hear a song and I can listen to it over and over and over again and it never gets old and it just makes me FEEL something that I like.  Do you ever find a song like that?  A million years ago in college, it was Lita Ford's \"Kiss Me Deadly.\"  I have no idea what it was about that song, it's not my typical music at all, but I couldn't get enough of it.  There have been just a few others since then, and this is one of them.\n\nI love the lyrics even though they are a bit depressing, they are just so true.  \"Love is a polaroid\/Better in picture\/But never can fill the void.\"  And so playful, too, \"I am a head case\/I am the color of boom\/Thats never arriving\/And you are the opera\/Always on time and in tune\/And I am the color of boom.\"  Who doesn't want to be the color of boom?  And how many of us Operas are moths to the flame of someone like that?  We Gregs want our Dharma,  Chuck Bartowskis want our Sarah Walkers, it's the classic case of opposites attracting.  But it's always better in pictures, isn't it?\n\nI can totally picture this being used by a SYTYCD choreographer for a mash-up piece with ballerinas and hip hop dancers.  I mostly buy music to workout to, and create a lot of my own Zumba-like or dance aerobic routines.  After a few times goofing around with them, I generally have a set routine down, but with this song I can't stop myself from just dancing.  It inspires my imagination.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I always want to love whatever Dido does, for she has an amazing voice that's extremely unique and expressive.  For the most part, this album certainly isn't something that I dislike, but the safeness of it all definitely turns it into a mediocre listening experience.  While the vocals are pleasant--though nothing past that--the music that backs her up sounds like someone playing around on one of those Casio keyboards that I had a couple of decades ago, on which I'd hit a button and get a drum line, then hit another button and I'd get a bass line. . . .\n\nThis album is, quite simply, safe.  Not once do I hear anyone here, vocalist or musician, challenging themselves to do something unique.  By the fourth song, my interest was completely gone, and there was nothing after that that brought my interest back.  I know that if I want to listen to Dido, I'm going to put on \"Life for Rent,\" because songs like \"Happy New Year\" (which is among the least-inspired songs musically that I've ever heard), \"Love to Blame,\" and \"Day before We Went to War\"--and virtually the entire album--sound heartless and soulless without significant music behind them to flesh out her vocals.\n\nIn an interview, Dido said that there were never any moments when making the songs here was difficult.  I believe that completely because it's very obvious that there was almost no challenge here.  Safe, boring musical tracks backing safe vocal tracks doesn't add up to a work of art here--they add up to a collection of songs that will sell quite a few copies and make quite a bit of money for an established artist, but if this was the work of a new artist, Dido wouldn't be gaining a following with this uninspired fare.","classification":2,"fold":7}

{"text":"In my continuing quest to find large, outstanding compilations of classical music at bargain prices, I have been very successful, unearthing several Big Box MP3 albums from The Bach Guild for 99 cents. They include Big Beethoven Box, Big Handel Oratorio Box, and others. So far, I have found each of them a delightful listening experience.\n\nI recently added Little Big Box: Bach Orchestral Music to my digital library. This album is very good. It features over four hours of Johann Sebastian Bachs orchestral music, including all of his Brandenburg Concertos and Orchestral Suites, as well as several concertos. All are performed with a high degree of artistry by a variety of world-class, but lesser known musicians.\n\nAlthough I think Little Big Box: Bach Orchestral Music certainly upholds the high standards of the other Big Box sets I own, I don't think it quite rises to the level of the finest albums of Bachs orchestral music, many of which I also own. (Those include: Brandenburg Concertos and Orchestral Suites by Trevor Pinnock and the English Concert; Keyboard Concertos by Murray Perahia and the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields; and Oboe Concertos by Christian Hommel and the Cologne Chamber Orchestra.)\n\nThe performances found on Little Big Box: Bach Orchestral Music appear to date from the mid-20th century. They feature various world-class orchestras, conductors, chamber ensembles, and solo instrumentalists, all of whom demonstrate a very high degree of artistry and musicianship. However, these performances seem (to my ears, anyway) to lack some of the driving tempos and pungency found in later historically informed performances of Bachs music that I prefer. Although these are mostly older stereophonic recordings, the audio quality of the entire album is clean, crisp, and well balanced.\n\nDespite my minor concerns about Little Big Box: Bach Orchestral Music I still think it is a good sampler of Johann Sebastian Bachs orchestral music. With its excellent performances, well-rounded musical selections, and good audio quality, and with its low price of 99 cents, I can easily recommend this album.","classification":4,"fold":7}
{"text":"John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band have been playing here in the Rhode Island area and around the Northeast for decades. In fact they are still at it. The group finally struck pay dirt in 1984 with a tune called \"On The Dark Side\" from the motion picture \"Eddie and the Cruisers\".  At long last this talented and hard-working outfit had themselves a major national hit. The single was originally released on the Scotti Brothers label in October 1983.  Listing the artist as \"Eddie and The Cruisers\" the song spent a total of 9 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart peaking at a rather lackluster #64.  But \"Eddie and The Cruisers\" would become something of a cult classic.  The record label saw fit to re-release the single In August of 1984.  Now the label credited \"John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band\" as being the artist.  The record got a ton of airplay and this time around the tune spent 18 weeks on the national charts peaking at #7.  What a terrific rock and roll record!  One of the best singles of the 1980's.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"With 2015s Shadows in the Night, Bob Dylan surprised us all with unique and compelling takes on some of the best songs the Great American Songbook has to offer. The record was a haunting, cohesive effort that also had some of his best singing in years. While normally not one to follow the same path for too long, the now 75 year old troubadour has followed up with another selection of Sinatra-esque standards, Fallen Angels.\n\nDespite the ominous title, Fallen Angels is a generally lighter affair than Shadows in the Night, which was exclusively torch songs. Here, Dylan diversifies the palette a little, with lighthearted takes on classics such as Young at Heart, the silly but charming Polka Dots and Moonbeams, and wily rendition of That Old Black Magic, which is the most fun Dylan seems to have had on record since Love and Theft. He even shows his romantic side, particularly on a wonderful take on the classic All the Way. What he lacks in matching Sinatras smoothness of tone he makes up for in terms of beauty, emotionality and phrasing, all of which are top-notch here.\n\nVocally, Dylan is once again on top form here, sounding surprisingly smooth throughout and rising to notes he hasn't been able to hit in years. His readings are uniformly impassioned, and the arrangements are appropriate and effective. Fallen Angels won't go down as a genre-defining masterpiece, but its a an extremely solid effort that showcase the Master on top of his latest game.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Her song Roar which she stole the rhythm and sampled Sara Bareilles' song Brave which was more down to Earth and intimate from the voice alone. For Katy, trying to make something original is like trying to find a new voice, which should work and it hasn't. Unconditionally, the second single from her latest album Prism is actually a very poor ballad. She really doesn't ignite from her voice and the feel of the lyrics isn't really the strength at best either. It really was a poor;y recorded and delivered song. I think if Katy Perry is going to have better in her career, she should try and make a song that feel ore unconditional with love.\n\nSong: D-","classification":2,"fold":7}

{"text":"As modern as Tank may try to portray himself, Tank's voice hearkens back to `old-school' adult R&B, which is the in the `minority' unfortunately.  Regardless of Tank's dismal commercial lot,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/This-Is-How-I-Feel\/dp\/B007MMRWTG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">This Is How I Feel<\/a>&nbsp;is a stronger showing for the R&B singer than 2010's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Now-Or-Never\/dp\/B003XJDSZ4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Now Or Never<\/a>&nbsp;was. Tank and producers attempt to change the formula ever so slightly by incorporating more hip-hop qualities as well as more overt, sensual lyrics. The effects work, even if at times the innuendo is ever so slightly overwrought.  Regardless, Tank remains in sound voice and shines throughout.\n\nThe intro \"How I Feel (Intro)\" sets up the sometimes salacious, self-confident nature of This Is How I Feel from the first line Tank utters claiming he's \"...the baddest mother [bleep] in the world...\" Despite his overconfidence, the use of harmonized background vocals and lush, urban production work foreshadow the soundness that makes This Is How I Feel so appealing. \"Lonely,\" featuring the ubiquitous Chris Brown is certainly a better collaboration between the two than \"Foreplay\" was from Now or Never.  The production is lush and tailor made to Tank's sensual, romantic voice.  Much like the intro, Tank's much more overt and explicit. Certainly the grinding groove incites Tank's inspired performance.  The only drawback - the cut is almost five minutes long.\n\n\"Your One\" is less enthralling than \"Lonely,\" but solid.  Soulful guitars and hip drum programming characterize this production.  The cut could use some extra finesse though; more background vocals would have energized the cut more.  \"Compliments (Interlude)\" follows, featuring Kris Stephens foreshadowing the full track. \"Compliments\" as a full entity is a solid cut, notable for both its production and songwriting.  Stephens continually graces the listener with the lines \"...I'm the most beautiful girl in the world...\" while Tank delights with his sensual, chivalrous hook \"We could start off with some compliments...\" T.I.'s verse is ok, but he's not necessary to the success of the cut.  Rap or not, \"Compliments\" is solid.\n\n\"Don't Give Up\" opens up nicely with Tank singing in falsetto \"You better work girl, work girl, work girl...\" The production is tasteful with piano and simplistic drum programming to begin with.  Unfortunately for \"Don't Give Up\" is that it follows a juggernaut in \"Compliments,\" arguably the best cut of the affair.  \"Nowhere\" doesn't quite restore This Is How I Feel to full fruition, though the quicker tempo serves as a nice contrast to \"Don't Give Up.\"  \"Off Your Hands\" is a winner through and through giving the solid \"Compliments\" a huge run for its money.  Well produced, well written, and an instant attention grabber, \"Off Your Hands\" is the urban ballad so many R&B singers wish they could pull off.  True R&B at its best, listening to the background vocal harmonies and commanding, sensual pipes of Tank makes you wish all R&B could go back to this lush sound.\n\n\"This Is How I Feel (Interlude)\" proceeds the full cut, which happens to be another winner.  \"This Is How I Feel\" is more `out-of-the-box' than \"Off You Hands,\" making it one of the more intriguing listens of this effort.  The drums sound particular solid and the grind-it-out groove is infectious.  Tank sounds at his best.  He remains on `autopilot' on the excellent single \"Next Breath,\" which isn't even the best cut from the effort.  What is notable about \"Next Breath\" is the fact that it provides adult R&B listeners with a traditional, adult-contemporary R&B single in the vein of Brian McKnight, Eric Bent or Kem.  The production is solid and even more notable might be the grit that Tank achieves, something we rarely hear from the vocalist.\n\n\"Better Than Me\" and \"Lost it All\" are less exciting cuts, but thankfully by this point Tank has given `his best.`  \"Better Than Me\" is a `B,' though to its credit it is a sound departure from the lewder cuts of the effort. The use of strings is definitely notable on this cut.  \"Lost it All\" is also a `B,' cut, but is probably appropriately placed as the closing cut.\n\nOverall,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/This-Is-How-I-Feel\/dp\/B007MMRWTG\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">This Is How I Feel<\/a>&nbsp;is one of Tank's better releases.  It is a shame that Tank does not have a higher visibility outside of the R&B market.  His songwriting and singing talents are truly amazing, even when he grows a bit too sensual.  Solid R&B album.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Presented in more or less chronological order, the first CD is filled with hits while the second CD covers Rosanne's career since the hits dried up. There is, of course, no drop in the quality of Rosanne's music on the second CD, which has always been at a high level. That said, I slightly prefer the hits CD overall, partly because of the greater familiarity of the songs but also because it seems to have more variation in pace and tempo.\n\nThe first CD omit's a couple of top 30 country hits from 1980 (Couldn't do nothing right, Take me take me) and a couple of top 5 country hits from the mid-eighties (Ain't no money, Second to no one) but it includes two early non-hits (Can I still believe in you?, Baby better start turnin' em down) together with her top ten country hit duet with Vince Gill (If it weren't for him) and her number one country hit duet with her former husband Rodney Crowell (It's such a small world). All of Rosanne's ten solo number country hits are also featured including Tennessee flat top box (a cover of one of her father's country hits) and I don't want to spoil the party (the first and so far only cover of a Beatles song to top the country chart  Rosanne wrote or co-wrote some of her own material including four of her number one hits (Seven year ache, Blue moon with heartache, I don't know why you don't want me, If you change your mind), so she certainly didn't depend on outside writers.\n\nThe second CD contains several tracks that were released as singles, to of which (On the surface, What we really want) became minor country hits while the others failed to chart at all. Not that it mattered, because Rosanne had established her career and was able to continue earning a living via tours and album sales, and she preferred to do things her way. Rosanne wrote most of the songs on this CD, with three of the five tracks that she didn't write coming from her excellent covers album The list. Among the original songs on this CD, highlights include her introspective The real me and the emotional September when it comes, a duet with her father.\n\nThis 36-track double CD provides an excellent introduction to Rosanne's music for anybody who hasn't got any of it, but is also great for anybody who (like me) has some of her music already. If you only want a hits collection and aren't interested in what came later, you could opt to buy one of the single CD compilations, but even though I slightly prefer the hits, Rosanne's later music is well worth hearing.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Cher made a huge comeback in late 1998 with BELIEVE, a song that made her comeback a success. This album dabbles mostly in electronica, which was very successful and a formula she again used on her 2002 album LIVING PROOF. The title track and hit single is an inspiring song about picking yourself up after failed chances. The rest of the album is pretty good too. \"All Or Nothing\" should have been a huge hit, its the highlight of the album. \"Runaway\" is another strong suit, should have been a single. She remakes her 80's classic \"We All Sleep Alone\" on here with an updated sound, excellent track. \"Strong Enough\" was the second single and basically has a similar theme to \"Believe\". Ohter highlights include \"Love Is The Groove\" and \"Dov'e L'Amore\". The only songs I didn't care for and felt were more bside quality were \"The Power\" and \"Taxi Taxi\". Cher may have comeback with this album, but I always felt her 1995 album ITS A MANS WORLD should have done that, as I feel its better than this album, but still check this one out nonetheless.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"This song begins with a series of techno notes overlaying a slowly rhythmic keyboard melody. At a minute slow drums enter and at a minute and a half a synthesized female vocal intertwines itself in the slow cadence. Overall the sound is favorably reminiscent of Teardrop by Massive Attack. Mid song there are some mild syncopations and empty moments that give a good contrast. If I have any complaints it is that the lyrics, while not intrusive, are just the same phrase (\"don't think about all those things you fear, just be glad to be here\"), but it is intermittent so not too irritating. If you like Massive Attack you will probably like this song.","classification":5,"fold":7}

There's about maybe 3 songs on here that of worthy of listening to over and over, and the rest is all repetitive. I swear after track 2 I was wondering if my vinyl copy was broken\/problematic, because it's so damned repetitive. Almost all the tracks have the same pattern of \"start off slow\/start music about a minute in\/delay vocals 30 seconds after\/verse\/chorus\/bridge\/chorus\/verse\/chorus\/long end\". That, plus Butler's whining is becoming just plain annoying to the point where I wanna superglue his lips together to make sure he doesn't make that grating noise, ever.\n\nWe Used To Wait, Empty Room and Suburban war are the 3 tracks that are worthy of listening to, and the rest is boring and repetitive doss.

{"text":"Crossover night for Otis took place in June 1967 at Monterey where he garnered a whole new audience. He provided insight to the \"Love Crowd\" from the universe in which he emerged. After that show he redefined himself and set out to stretch his music and had created an amalgamation of disparate styles while still extolling the virtues of R&B tradition. Most evident is that he was incorporating more rock and tackling funk into his music than what came before. Yet these brilliant song structures have the same economy and clarity.\n\nThis is a masterpiece diffused with personal introspection. He's forged an individual sound with the responsive backing unit of Booker T. & The MGs' and the Mar-Keys. This is a crucial collaboration in which every musician has empathy towards the material and this can be attributed to their unity.\n\nThe tricky key changes and brass arrangements seem to amplify the desire in the lyrics. The use of the stop-start break on \"Nobody's Fault But Mine\" is an ideal touch. Otis's rough-and-ready baritone elevates the spirit of each song and it's revealing in its totality. His delicacy of expression on \"Think About It\" complements its pointed analysis. He's playful on the suggestive \"Hard To Handle\". The poignancy in his voice on \"I've Got Dreams To Remember\" is truly gut-wrenching. An extraordinary revival of \"Amen\" is straight out of a country Georgia church as though Otis was baptizing new lives. On the readymade classic \"The Happy Song (Dum-Dum)\", he weaves a narrative with his subtle humor as he devilishly gloats. This song stands as my absolute favorite in his entire canon.\n\nThis towering figure in American Soul Music bestowed a beautiful gift and the world is better off for it. This is an eminently powerful draft of his final recordings and a true find.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"The last three concerts of the Monkees summer 1967 concert tour were professionally recorded, with the idea of assembling a live album from the tapes.  Also, two weeks before those concerts, a member of the Monkees touring crew recorded one of their concerts, probably for his own use.  As far as I know, these four concerts are the only recordings of Monkees concerts from the 1960s that exist.  Unfortunately, the exact same songs were played in the exact same order at all four shows.  Which is not to say that the concerts are exactly the same.  The Monkees make different mistakes at each of the concerts.  Sometimes they sing the wrong lyrics, sometimes they play the wrong notes.  And there are often technical problems with the microphones and instruments.  Probably the major difference other than the mistakes is in the ad libs that the Monkees say during the concerts.  They even occasionally ad lib a few lines from songs like \"Singin' in the Rain\", \"There's No Business Like Show Business\" and \"Act Naturally\".  So, is it worth owning copies of all four concerts?  Not really, unless you're an absolute Monkees fanatic.  Of course, I own this collection, so I guess you know where I stand.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"I am going to admit that the only reason I picked this up is because I came across I Surrender on YouTube and was moved to worship and tears.  I wanted that song in my collection and hoped that I would find more of the same.  Well, I both did and didnt.  I did because there is a bounty of worship none of which I was familiar with but I didn't because I didn't find any other song that generated the same type of emotional or worshipful connection that I Surrender did.  Im not terribly into worship music and don't like a lot of it so when I find something that I resonate so strongly with I end up having high hopes.  I wasn't disappointed but sometimes I found myself having to work at being engaged.  I do think that the albums last two tracks, Greater Than All with its crescendoing force and a studio version of Hope of the World with an upfront piano line and steady rhythm, are very good worship songs.  Vocalists vary and include both men and women leads.  There are some other tracks on here that are moving or that I just enjoy (the production is such that the live experience is muted and it really sounds more like a studio album with background shouts and choral voices and echoes tracked down) and I was surprised at how long Hillsong has been doing this and it being commercially available.  Personally I don't know that I will go out and purchase another Hillsong Live disc but at least they're on my radar.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Calvin Harris' latest hit, \"Summer\" is just an 'ok' song.  I applaud him for continuing to get involved on the vocal side of his songs (which most DJs won't do), but this particular one is not one of his better efforts.  For me, part of the issue is the choice of music.  With some music templates, they are relatively timeless and can be used 20 years after they were first used and still sound fresh.  Others seem like they are product of the particular time frame they were first used.  With \"Summer\", it sounds like beats that were wholly characteristic of 2005-2006 on the music scene (specifically Cascada's \"Everytime We Touch\").  Instead of sounding fresh, it is more like listening to a local Mix station playing hits from a decade ago.\n\n  That being said, it's still a good song.  It's just not great.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"I love Tommy Shaw, and Damn Yankees to this day is still one of my favorite rock bands of all time despite their short run. Nonetheless, while Tommy was doing his thing with Ted Nugent and the boys, Styx was also creating one very fine pop\/rock album. While this might not quite stand up to their classic stuff, it was still a very refreshing, enjoyable listen around 1990-91 when it came out.\nGlen Burtnik was Tommy Shaw's replacement, and he brought a great energy to the band for this effort. To this day, I love the leadoff track on this album with Glen on lead vocals, \"Love Is The Ritual\". While some might say that this sounds nothing like Styx, I counter with this: what does Styx really sound like? Their sound has never stayed the same, and for sure this catchy, rocking song is a great start to the album. Next comes another famous Dennis DeYoung ballad, and it stands up in quality to the rest of them. \"Show Me The Way\" is the one song that \"strictly radio people\" may still remember from this album. Truly another fine hit ballad.\nNext comes another upbeat Burtnik track--the title track. Also a fun, exciting sounding song. Then comes \"Love At First Sight\", another quality DeYoung ballad that did make a dent in the to 40 charts. The fifth track on the album is a beautiful and to me unique song--\"All In A Day's Work\". Here is the one time on the album you hear the softer side of Glen as he teams with Dennis on a very sweet, sad song.\nEveryone who has followed this band talks about how Dennis doesn't rock anymore. For sure, that is true. But for one track at least we get to hear Dennis sing a rocker one more time. \"Not Dead Yet\" is a very whimsical song in which Dennis shows a rocking side which certainly hasn't been seen since. Then comes \"World Tonite\", another rocking Burtnik anthem. \"Carrie Ann\" is another sweet DeYoung ballad, and while I appreciate the sentiment of the song it is what I refer to as the \"one too many ballad syndrome\" on the album. Still a nice song, though.\nFinally, James Young gets to sing on track nine, and he puts forth a typical rocking effort on \"Homewrecker\", nicely offsetting the previous Dennis ballad. Then Dennis sings again on the closing track \"Back To Chicago\", which is a bit more uptempo than the other ballads and includes a nice brass section.\nI rate Styx albums like \"The Grand Illusion\" and \"Pieces Of Eight\" as true five-star albums. This one isn't to the level of those classics, but it still is great fun. Call it 4 3\/4 stars for an album that truly was a worthy comeback by an all-time legendary rock outfit. Surely the later comeback album in 1999 \"Brave New World\", even with Tommy Shaw again involved, doesn't measure up to this one. Definitely still an enjoyable listen after all these years.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"It seems strange now with the hindsight of 46 years distance that 1971's hugely articulate \"Muswell Hillbillies\" by THE KINKS was such a commercial dog. Their newest platter and first with RCA Records was released November 1971 on both sides of the pond - but barely managed a No. 100 placing in the US LP charts with a big fat zilch in the UK.\n\nBut then again 1970's \"Lola Versus Powerman...\" and 1971's Soundtrack to \"Percy\" (both on Pye) hadnt bothered British LP charts either. In fact - excepting obvious crowd-pleasing hit singles between the LPs like \"Lola\" and \"Apeman\" and despite the musical-excellence of what Raymond Douglas Davies & Co. was collectively producing - the public seemed utterly indifferent  especially in their native Blighty. I can recall this album being in bargain bins for decades. Commercially this most British of bands were adrift in arguably their most creative period...\n\nAnd that's where this rather excellent 2014 'Legacy Edition' 2-Disc reissue of \"Muswell Hillbillies\" comes in - determined to get us all to see the error of our fatuous ways. Armed with nine Bonus Tracks and a new DVD of period recordings on Disc 2 (all restored) - here are the cups of tea and pints of beer in the Archway Tavern...\n\nUK released 19 December 2014 (10 November 2014 in the USA) - \"Muswell Hillbillies: Legacy Edition\" by THE KINKS on RCA\/Legacy 88843093772 (Barcode 888430937727) is a 2-Disc Reissue and Remaster [1CD + 1DVD] that plays out as follows:\n\nDisc 1 CD \"Muswell Hillbillies\" - The Original Album (72:30 minutes):\n1. 20th Century Man [Side 1]\n2. Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues\n3. Holiday\n4. Skin And Bone\n5. Alcohol\n6. Complicated Life\n7. Here Come The People In Grey [Side 2]\n8. Have A Cuppa Tea\n9. Holloway Jail\n10. Oklahoma U.S.A.\n11. Uncle Son\n12. Muswell Hillbilly\nTracks 1 to 12 are their 11th album \"Muswell Hillbillies\" - released 24 November 1971 in the UK on RCA Victor Records SF 8243 and in the USA on RCA Victor LSP 4644. Produced by Ray Davies - it peaked at No. 100 on the US LP charts - didn't chart in the UK.\n\nBONUS TRACKS:\n13. Lavender Lane\n14. Mountain Woman\n15. Have A Cuppa Tea (Alternate Version)\n16. Uncle Son (Alternate Version)\n17. Kentucky Moon\n18. Nobody's Fool (Demo)\n19. 20th Century Man (Alternate Instrumental Take)\n20. Queenie (Backing Track)\n21. Muswell Hillbillies Radio Spot\n\nTHE KINKS were:\nRAY DAVIES - Vocals, Guitars and Keyboards\nDAVE DAVIES - Vocals and Guitar\nJOHN GOSLING - Keyboards and Accordion\nJOHN DALTON - Bass\nMICK AVARY - Drums\n\nGuests:\nVicki Brown - Backing Vocals on \"Skin And Bone\" and \"Holloway Jail\"\nKen Jones - Harmonica on \"Here Come The People In Grey\"\nMike Cotton Sound [Mike Cotton, Trumpet - Alan Holmes, Clarinet - John Beecham, Trombone and Tuba]  play on the LP cuts \"Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues\" and \"Alcohol\" and on \"Lavender Lane\" in the Bonus Tracks\n\nDisc 2, DVD (NTSC, Region 0):\nTHE OLD GREY WHISTLE TEST - BBC TV 4 January 1972\n1. Have A Cuppa Tea\n2. Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues\n\nTHE KINKS AT THE RAINBOW - BBC TV 21 July 1972\n3. Till The End Of The Day\n4. Waterloo Sunset\n5. The Money-Go-Round\n6. Sunny Afternoon\n7. The Virgin Soldier March\n8. She Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina\n9. Alcohol\n10. Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues\n11. You Really Got Me\n\nWhat the track list on the rear cover of this Legacy 2-Disc issue doesn't advise is that there's more footage on the DVD in-between tracks than is listed above. \"The Virgin Soldier March\" section includes the whole of the (rather rough) opening credits to the 1969 John Dexter movie \"The Virgin Soldiers\" starring Lynn Redgrave, Hywel Bennett, Nigel Davenport, Nigel Patrick and an uncredited David Bowie as a soldier (Wayne Sleep is credited). It features Ray's music playing throughout with the Mike Cotton Sound being the brass band accompanying him. There is also a short interview with Carl Foreman (clearly a fan of Ray Davies and his articulate writing) discussing how Ray's incendiary British lyrics were re-written\/softened by the American studios so as not to offend or illicit riots in Washington (marches that didn't materialise). There is also interviews with the clearly bemused\/amused owner of the grimy Archway Tavern Pub in North London and patrons supping pints being asked how they feel now that they've been immortalised on the gatefold album cover (cue more laughter). The Mike Cotton Sound brass ensemble are also introduced by Davies to the live audience at The Rainbow and play with The Kinks on three tracks -  \"She Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina\", \"Alcohol\" and \"Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues\".\n\nThe three-way foldout digipak offers a new period photo on the left flap with tape boxes pictured beneath each CD and its see-through tray. The 28-page colour booklet is a pleasingly well-endowed affair - pictures of Ray alongside black and whites\/colours of the decidedly longhaired five-piece band. The booklet's front and back cover reproduce that photo where the 'Cats On Holiday' shop is all but obliterated by aluminium sheeting. The four-leaf foldout display of centre pages shows foreign picture sleeves for \"20th Century Man\" (Japan) and sheet music to \"Supersonic Rocket Ship\" as well as trade adverts and reviews - it even has a 26 June 1972 ticket stub for the Free Trade Hall in Manchester with Steve Goodman as the support act. IRA ROBBINS of New York provides the very entertaining and well-written liner notes - examining the album's themes of Her Majesty's Government interference in normal people's lives - inner city alienation - people in red coming to take him away - all of this working-class British angst wrapped up in American imagery of Shirley Jones, Errol Flynn and Doris Day.\n\nANDREW SANDOVAL - who handled all of the Universal 'Deluxe Editions' for The Kinks Pye years - is the Project co-ordinator once again. But the big news is a new Remaster - the first generation tapes transferred by RICHARD WHITTAKER at FX Mastering in London and the Remastering carried out by the vastly experienced VIC ANESINI at Battery Studios in New York. Anesini is a name I actively seek out - he's sprinkled his knob-twiddling fairy dust magic on the catalogues of Elvis Presley, Simon & Garfunkel, The Byrds, Nilsson, Santana, The Jayhawks, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Mountain, Carole King and many more. This album was always a muddy mess to me - compounded by that 'Flexi' vinyl crap RCA engaged in at the beginning of the decade. There are hissy moments still on this remastered CD (the acoustic beginning of \"Holiday\" is just one of them) - but those slide guitars on \"Holloway Jail\" and the barroom piano on \"Have A Cuppa Tea\" now have more oomph for damn sure. That drum and guitar intro to \"Skin And Bone\" has fantastic punch all of a sudden - and there are other moments too. A good job done that's allowed the LP to breathe anew...\n\nAs Ray sings \"...I was born in a welfare state...ruled by bureaucracy...controlled by civil servants...and people dressed in grey...\" on the brilliant opener \"20th Century Man\" - you gather our Douglas is concerned once again for England's no-longer green and pleasant land and especially its increasingly homogenised and divided populace. Many critics commented on the depth of the song themes and lyrics (there's a lot of them) and their social commentary and insight  but it didn't seem to move the buying public in the same way. Just after the albums release - RCA put the song \"20th Century Man\" out as a US 45 in December 1971 (RCA Victor 74-0620) with the equally hard-hitting social consciousness of \"Skin And Bone\" on the B-side. But despite the lyrical\/musical strengths of both sides - there were few takers. RCA Britain didn't even bother to support the album with a 7\" single - their first UK 45 on RCA Victor being the new \"Supersonic Rocket Ship\" in May 1972  which in itself acted as an advance promotion for the \"Everybody's In Show Biz\" double in August.\n\nThe hippy dream is dead and nailed to the wall in the brilliant \"Alcohol\" where some floozy has fleeced a heartbroken sucker - and The Kinks begin to sound awfully like Lindisfarne's \"Fog On The Tyne\" on \"Complicated Life\" (the accordion and guitars are clearer). You also notice how well he's integrated the Mike Cotton Sound brass ensemble into \"Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues\" and \"Holloway Jail\". I never was a fan of the 'Hallelujah Rosie Lea' cod nostalgia of \"Have A Cuppa Tea\" - but I'm loving the slide acoustic guitars of \"Uncle Son\" where The Kinks sound like Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance three years before the event. Recorded 17 October 1971 at Morgan Studios in Willesden, London - the album finisher and title track \"Muswell Hillbillies\" could easily be one of those Rolling Stones Country-Rock jaunts they throw so effectively into the Blues-Rock mix of their albums (\"Let It Bleed\" and \"Sticky Fingers\" jump to mind).\n\nAnd as ridiculously good outtakes - you'd have to call \"Lavender Lane\" (a sort of acoustic \"Waterloo Sunset\"), \"Mountain Woman\" and the superb piano pain of \"Kentucky Moon\" - more evidence of the album's greatness (even the rejects were hitting the mark). The 50-second Radio Spot advert tells of \"Album of The Year\" from many American publications - but the public itself thought otherwise. It's also nice to see the Old Grey Whistle Test and Rainbow footage so clean - and dig those credits to \"The Virgin Soldiers\" movie from 1969 with Raymond Douglas Davies credited for the music (his full name used).\n\nI'd admit that the hiss levels on some tracks are disappointing - but as I re-listen to this excellent remaster - I'm digging it more and more and my admiration for the LP has gone through the roof. Fans apparently magic-markered their song requests onto paper plates at gigs - flinging them stage-ward as the Band played. Flick your schizophrenic paper plates this way and hope for a reply...","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"For readers wondering what I am referring to in the title,it only refers to a childhood game I made up shortly after I discovered Pet Shop Boys for the first time. It was the way everyone else did via \"West End Girls\" and somehow or other their sound became refreshingly addictive and captivating. In a very healthy way. The pair did a lot to teach me the value of crafting an great pop song,no matter what contemporary technology assisted in creating the music itself. Also related was my understanding of the value of melodicism in dance music. As for Neil and Chris and their relationship to the dance music world,they've seen it all in my lifetime anyway. The post disco period in which they came together via Bobby Orlando,having that great one\/two punch with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Please\/dp\/B000002U9K\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Please<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Actually\/dp\/B000002UD7\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Actually<\/a>&nbsp;and along the way helping Dusty Springfiled become a star again. Well for one shinning moment. But the duo soldiered on. Wrote and produced for Liza Minnelli and,in the 90's survived a massive assault on anything associated with the 80's,particularly dance music with wonderful ventures such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Behavior\/dp\/B000002UWL\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Behavior.<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Very\/dp\/B000002USP\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Very<\/a>. They beat the odds many years ago. And if they'd retired after the mid 1990's,it would've still seemed like a long and creatively lucrative career. But that didn't happen. They are still around. And they are still expanding what they do further into different arenas.\n\n  Always great commentators on the world around them,in particular with Neil's lyrical wit and intellect,there's plenty of source material for this new album to draw on. Overall there's a feeling of acceptance of all kinds of relationships,beginning and leaving them. And musically? Well the album starts off with leaving and also has another song \"A Face Like That\". These showcase the vitality of the musically layered eurodance\/pop\/post disco sound the band pioneered in their salad days. Even in the world of bassy,effects laden EDM sounds everywhere at this current time,there's still a place for their more subtle approach to their chosen genre. The more ambient side of their nature is reflected in \"Invisable\",as well as a more uncertain side of their personality. The wit is most present on two songs,both in the more abstract electronica mode. \"Your Early Stuff\" sounds like a conversation from someone to Neil and Chris about their stubbornness in sticking around when their are newer and more popular faces in their crowd. \"Ego Music\" is more obviously self explanatory in terms of exploring the consciousness of an internally shallow pop star trying to convince everyone how \"deep\" he is to gain recognition and likely sexual encounters.  \"Give It A Go\" explores a modern take on the world of 60's Northern Soul,a cross between the world Dusty Springfield helped usher in and people like Adele have continued recently.\n\n  \"Breathing Space\",\"Memory Of The Future\",\"Everything Means Something\" and \"Winner\" all have an epic flavor blending live instruments with Chris Lowes electronic productions. The song that actually impresses me most in a way is the closer \"Requim in Denim And Leopardskin\". Lyrically it seems to speak of reflections on the past pointing to the possibility of either musical continuation or retirement. Neil's conversational lyrical poetry is at an all time high on this song. But most impressive is the sleek,percussive and rather funky disco\/dannce\/pop musical sound of the song featuring what sounds like a completely live band. It shows once and for all (for those not quite convinced) their type of dance compositions can function totally outside the electronic effects they often have. And there's also another exciting thing about this. The lyrics all tell stories as always. But as always they also have an ambiguity about them. In fact,my particular views on the intent of this lyrics could be completely backwards to what they really are. Having ready their book&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Pet-Shop-Boys-Literally\/dp\/0306804948\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pet Shop Boys, Literally<\/a>,Neil & Chris are one of a group of people I would love to talk to about pop music and it's influence on society.

Thanks to a casual email exchange with a friend, I was finally brought up to speed.\n\nIt is far too early for me to truly assess how I feel about \"Seven\" since I can sometimes take awhile to truly appreciate a new album. How I wish most albums were instant no-brainers like the Album(s) of the Year, \"The 20\/20 Experience Pts. 1 & 2). I will say, the last few songs on \"Seven\" drew my intention more than the first half.\n\nBut, I rate it 4 stars because I trust that this final work by Vesta will soon find a place in my heart.\n\nShe looks great on the album.

{"text":"Where did this movie come from?  I wasn't even aware that a Tarzan movie was in the works until the soundtrack was made available on Amazon.  Since then, I've watched a few of the trailers and the movie looks impressive and it seems to have earned some positive feedback from those who have seen it.  It appears to have been released overseas and is slated for a July 1st opening in the United States.  Rupert Gregson-Williams is providing the score for this latest film about the iconic character and some of you film score fans might see something familiar about that name.  Rupert Gregson-Williams is the younger brother of film score composer Harry Gregson-Williams (who has done films like \"Chronicles of Narnia\", \"X-Men Origins:  Wolverine\", \"The Equalizer\", and \"The Martian\").  I was first introduced to Rupert Gregson-Williams through his \"Battlefield 2:  Modern Combat\" (2005) video game score.  He's also done numerous film scores for Adam Sandler's Happy Madison Productions, as well as, a lot of animated film like \"Over the Hedge\" 2006) and \"Bee Movie\" (2007).  I know he also provided the score for \"Winter's Tale\" (2014) but that is one that I haven't heard yet.  \"The Legend of Tarzan\" appears to be a move towards some of the more blockbuster type films that his brother gets involved with and I think he's done a fairly good job with this one.\n\nThe score begins with \"Opar\" (track 1) performed by Zoe Mthiyane.  This opening track immediately takes you to the mysterious and foreboding jungle landscape.  This opening piece is both beautiful and dangerous with Mthiyane's vocals setting up the mood of the setting wonderfully.  She also provides her talents briefly in the piece entitled \"Elephants in the Night\" (track 13).  Her work here combined with RGW's (Rupert Gregson-Williams) music really works well together in creating a peaceful and almost magically surreal moment in the score as you envision these animals in their habitat.  \"Diamonds\" (track 2) is a bit less interesting and appears to be more conflict introducing.  I suspect that there is evil and greed surrounding the diamond trade here.  The tone of the piece is largely ominous evil with a dash or horror mixed in.  I particularly enjoyed some of the more sentimental pieces in the score like \"Togetherness\" (track 3), \"Campfire\" (track 7) and \"Tarzan and Jane\" (track 8).  \"Campfire\" is a bit bolder, thematic, and heroic with it's accompanying support of a choir.  The pieces are not overly complex and at times can be quite daydreamy, especially in the case of \"Tarzan and Jane\".\n\nA Tarzan movie means action and adventure however and you can be sure to find some of that music here as well.  \"Akut Fight\" (track 12) is a really interesting one that grows into an all out brawl.  The percussion work is great and there is this wild sounding tribal (electronically generated) horn sound that is pretty intense.  \"Stampede\" (track 19) is also an epic sounding action track that shifts into various movements to keep things interesting and \"The Legend of Tarzan\" (track 21) revisits some of the themes and moments found throughout the score.\n\nThe score definitely works and has plenty of moments both in the action and sentimental realms to keep things interesting and enjoyable to listen to.  The tribal percussion work, solo vocals provided by Zoe Mthiyane, and choir work from the London Voices really help to bring us to this environment and take you away on an adventure in Tarzan's world.  I wish the score could of been more \"organic\" in it's presentation however and rely less on some of the electronically produced instrument sounds.  It would of been great to experiment with unusual and exotic instrumentation to help connect more with the jungle environment of the film.  Although Hans Zimmer is not specifically credited in the liner notes, I'm sure he played an advisory role somewhere.  The score is big and it's diverse enough to keep things interesting however.\n\nApparently they are not releasing an official CD for this soundtrack so I opted to go for the CDR version offered by Amazon.  Both the digital download and CDR versions of the score are currently inexpensive fortunately.  The CDR sounds great and all tracks played flawlessly.  There is a 12 page insert that contains photos from the film, a brief note from director David Yates, production credits, and some photos of Hozier in the studio working on the included song \"Better Love\" (track 22).  Hozier fans won't be disappointed with this latest song from the talented artist.  He wrote this song specifically for this film and it obviously reflects the love between Tarzan and Jane.  The CDR contains 22 tracks with a running time of 1 hour and 12 minutes.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Conor Oberst once made the ambitious mis-step or releasing two Bright Eyes albums at once; he issued the classic \"I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning\" and the cringe worthy electronica of \"Digital Ash in A Digital Urn\" on the same day. One was a beautiful, thoughtful descendant of Bob Dylan, the other was an amateurish Kraftwerk homage. \"The People's Key\" sounds like he learned from that moment and pulled the best of each onto one album. \"The People's Key\" uses a full band to highlight Oberst's gifts of melody, penchant for strange narratives\/spirituality and his curiosity for electronic instruments and forges them into a dynamic album with many highlights.\n\nLike Iron and Wine's \"Kiss Each Other Clean\" (issues roughly the same time), \"The People's Key\" shows Oberst fleshing out the edges of his comfort zone with richer arrangements and fuller singing. Purists might not take to it easily, but there is a direct line from Oberst's time in Monster's Of Folk (who did a raucous concert performance), his more personal songs on the solo album and the opening narrative of \"Cassadaga.\" Also, like Dylan, there are moments of inexplicable lyrical oddities that are as filled with beauty as they are strange. Who else could rhyme the title of the song \"Haile Selassie\" with the line about his audio equipment (\"one drop and a bubbling Leslie, calling me home like Haile Selassie\").\n\nOberst is a restless artist, as anyone who has followed his eclectic career can tell you. The wild mood swings on \"The People's Key\" are testament to that factor, yet it is strong enough an album to hold together. I'll probably always be wedded to the style of the man who wrote and sang \"I'm Wide Awake,\" but even the annoying \"shamanic vocals\" credited to one Denny Brewer (without which I might have given this 5 stars) can distract from the richness of \"The People's Key.\"","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I've always liked The Killers.  Sure they had hit or miss albums.  Hot Fuss is a modern classic that brought back sounds of the 80s in good infectious fashion with it's post-punk revival vibe.  Their second album had a change in tone to Heartland Rock similar to early Springsteen, which sounds good on paper but was far from their best album even though the lead single, 'When You Were Young', was one of their most memorable.  Day and Age was slightly better but still a slight downward trend for the band.  I still to this day think that Battle Born is the bands best and most underrated album.  Brandon himself recently disregarded the album, but I think that was mostly because of its lack of success compared to others.  He'll appreciate his Frankenstein monster album soon enough again.  So enough of me being typical and yapping away about The Killers and let me talk about Brandon Flowers and this new album.  Many will disagree but I thought Flowers debut solo album was a near dud.  Sure it had the hit song 'Crossfire' and some other decent songs, but it was not an amazing album.  It just didn't work for me and its no surprise that the sales of the album quickly failed.  This new album on the other hand is a huge breath of fresh air for Flowers solo career.  When I heard the lead single 'Can't Deny My Love', I was blown away but I was worried it would be the 'Crossfire' of the new album, meaning, the only good song.  As he released 3 more songs from the album I was quickly proved wrong as each one seemed to be better than the other.  I'll say this beforehand.  It's impossible to not compare this album to The Killers, because Flowers was the main identifier of the band and his voice and style hasn't really changed much in this solo release.  That being said, remember when I said that Battle Born is The Killers best album?  Well this album is even better.  Here is a track by track review.\n\n1. Dreams Come True:  Talk about a great opener!  Such a dreamy and upbeat uplifting pop gem.  The horns throughout are just classy and the chorus is so catchy it gives me a tingly feeling.  The last minute and a half is extra amazing.  Possibly the best opener of Flowers career so far, including that of his band.  10\/10\n2. Can't Deny My Love:  The lead single.  I love the song.  Its like a modern take on the classic song \"I Need A Hero\" but with male vocals.  It's an anthem for sure.  The groovy guitars, the synths, the vocals, the beats, the awesomeness.  It's a shame it hasn't hit as big as it should've.  This is the type of song that sounds like it would dominate the world but it hasn't.  Hopefully it rebounds.  Great song, but believe it or not, it's definitely not the best on the album, which is a good thing.  9.5\/10\n3. I Can Change:  This is another one of Flowers U2 inspired songs.  If you hate U2 sorry but this is a compliment to say this sounds like a lost U2 track from the early 90s.  Things start off slow before the beat and synths come in, then comes the heavenly evangelic backing vocals throughout that are similar to U2 hits like \"Ultraviolet\" and the recent \"Iris\".  This song just gets better and better.  Great inspiring love song that I'm sure would sound great in a 80s style montage in a movie about a guy trying to win back his girl!  10\/10\n4. Still Want You:  At first I wasn't that impressed with the song as a whole when it was released.  But its just so impossibly catchy.  It gets twice as good with each listen and never gives up.  The playful staccato synth thoughout just makes me feel good.  The chorus has an oldschool betty boop feel but if that sounds off putting to some don't worry, it really works.  Another song to win back an ex that you know shouldn't be an ex.  9.5\/10\n5. Between Me And You: Another early Springsteen styled song.  It really sounds like it could be among songs like 'Jungleland' and not feel out of place.  Very romantic and emotional track.  I think his vocals are the best on this track.  Sure he doesn't really reach any high notes, but its his overall performance that just impresses so much.  Everything about this song screams romance, and not corny at all.  10\/10\n6. Lonely Town:  Just wow.  What a great song this is.  It has everything.  Catchy vocals that you will have stuck in your head.  Awesome attention to detail to every instrumental aspect even if it's just something small in the background.  Great lyrics.  A perfect song.  Some will complain about one certain moment in the song that uses autotune, but ignore those bigots.  This song is something divine.  10\/10\n7. Diggin' Up The Heart: Another gem!  This one features a strangely appealing guitar riff in the beginning before it turns into a perfect synth song for the road.  There is this great background synth during the chorus in the second half similar to the opening track of Battle Born that is just pure eargasmic.  Love it.  10\/10\n8. Never Get You Right:  Can it be?  Another great song?  Yes!  This is another one that pays so much attention to detail with its little moments you'll miss on your first listen.  This song is meant for headphones or good quality car stereos.  Such a feelgood song with another chorus that you won't get out of your head.  The production is so crisp and beautiful!  10\/10\n9. Untangled Love:  Another Springsteen styled song in the verses with a little Bono styled chorus again.  I just love Flowers ability to come up with some of the most beautifully catchy chorus's.  He really knows how to use backing vocals or effects perfectly without sounding generic.  There are nice guitar moments throughout in the slight background throughout too. 9.3\/10\n10. The Way It's Always Been:  A great closer to the album.  Very soothing.  Theres the typical Flowers light Queen styled vocals that sneak up to remind you its there.  But mostly its a laid back and relaxing.  It's definitely not as catchy as the rest but so what?  Just a nice song to sit back and enjoy.  If you don't like it at first, listen to it a few more times and it'll grow.  9\/10\n\nSo this was a much better album than Flowers debut solo effort.  He doesn't stray too far away from the style of The Killers and thats good.  Sorry naysayers but not all solo artists need to break away from the sound that made them loved in the first place.  This is the style of music that Brandon does best.  Honestly if he made an all out Alt Rock album that experimented with wacky sounds too much I think it would've failed.  This is just an all out catchy and beautifully epic pop rock album that does what many recently have tried but failed to do, and that is to perfectly pay homage to the sound of the 80s.  Dare I say it?  I think Flowers took the best part of 80s pop and improved it for a modern album.  Yeah I can already see many of you shaking your heads at that comment but its very true.  Don't be too hipster and realize the truth of this mans genius and musical power.  Yeah honestly this sounds like another Killers album, but much better as I've stated.  I know many will think \"But the rest of the band matter too\", and thats true, but they don't matter nearly as much as Flowers.  If his band released an album without him, it wouldn't be The Killers.  Flowers voice is the ultimate legacy holder of the band whether its with them or solo.  This album keeps that legacy going.  Hopefully this album finds the success it deserves.  It needs to be heard.  Not overlooked.  If you're a fan of his band, then you'll more than love this album.  If you're new to this mans voice and style, but love the sound of the 80s, then remember my previous comment about that.  If you love good music, you'd be doing your ears a favor in checking this album out.  It's a rare pop album that has no filler and doesn't stop in its quest to make you love it.  Highly recommended.  Its worth the money.  I'd even say you should actually purchase the CD.  Sure you can enjoy it on Spotify, but having this gem physically just makes it that much more endearing.  Your choice though.  Great album.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"One of the key factors that made the late Ray Charles Robinson the musical icon he become in the two or three decades before his passing was the fact that,if blues came from the crossroads than Brother Ray was crossing the musical interaction. During his salad years of the late 50's\/early 60's there was hard bop jazz,urban electric blues and country\/western music all somehow playing on jukeboxes in black communities all over America. Ray Charles had reflected this all. Of course the foundation in all of this,if not overtly was the blues form. And considering,even on his later Atlantic days,Ray was beginning to deal with concept albums as a strong musical possibility. It would simply be the right musical choice to reflect his roots in the blues.\n\n  \"Early In The Mornin'\" and \"I'm Movin' On\" are the two major uptempo numbers here. The melodic form is right there,smack in the center of the 12-bar blues. Yet the rhythm is right out of that Afro-Latin vibe-with Ray's electric piano all making this an extension of the uptempo,funky soul sound he'd pioneered a couple of years earlier with \"What'd I Say\". \"The Right Time\",while nostalgically conjuring up that image of Rudy Huxtable in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Cosby-Show\/dp\/B00GOC74Z2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Cosby Show<\/a>&nbsp;is an elegant,chunky number full of Fathead Newman's growling sax and the Raelette's singing at their prime. Not to even mention Ray going from his strong vocal lead to impassioned cries at a moments notice.  \"I Believe In My Soul\" starts out with a rather Oriental sounding melody on the piano while Charles own compositions \"Hard Times (No One Knows Better Than I)\",\"The Midnight Hour\",\"Feelin' Sad\",'Ray's Blues\",\"Nobody Cares\",\"Mr. Charles Blues\",\"Some Day Baby\" and \"I Wonder Who\" are all mid to low tempo straight up piano based jazzy blues numbers.\n\n  With the recent passing of Crusaders pianist\/co-founder Joe Sample? I've come to think about how grateful music fans of my age group should really be that currently deceased  musical icons such as James Brown,Ray Charles and even someone as late in the game as Michael Jackson were still around during part of our lifetime. Many were musicians who played,some were masterful performs and some were both. But to people such as myself? They will not merely be a page in a history book. Even though this album was recorded almost twenty years before I was born? The strands of the new music I'd have absorbed as a child are ever present here. The really exciting part is Ray was an originator too-the key architect of the soul genre. And here he is in 1961-paying a vital musical tribute to a genre that he absorbed growing up. And so the cycle continues,and meets full circle. Pretty likely this is going to be one of the finest and most important albums you'll ever hear in your life!","classification":5,"fold":7}
{"text":"\"24 Karat Gold ~ Songs From the Vault\" is a newly recorded album by Stevie Nicks, however if you didn't know better you would easily think this was a long lost album from Stevie. Going back to 2010 when Stevie was working on her \"In Your Dreams\" album she discovered one her lost demos, \"Secret Love\", on YouTube. She reworked that track for that album. Jump ahead a few years and she discovered lots more of her lost demos on YouTube and with a few weeks this past spring, she and producer Dave Stewart headed down to Nashville to rework these tracks.\n As a long time fan, I've had these demos in my collection for years, when I heard what her plan was, I was skeptical. This isn't the first time she's reworked old demos, but the results haven't always been great. Listen to her original demo for \"Smile At You\", then check out the watered down released version on Fleetwood Mac's \"Say You Will\". Would she be able to recapture the magic in these original demos, or would the suffer the same fate of \"Smile At You\" where too much time has passed and the inspiration behind the song is long forgotten. Another concern was her voice, it's aged a lot since the recording of the demos. The answer is not only do these songs come to life, but in nearly every case, outshine the demos.\n  Among the highlights, the album kicks off with \"Starshine\", this is a fun rocker that is a great album opener and would also be a killer opening song on stage. If you're familiar with the demo, you'll hear how she really recaptured the feel of 1980 and the recording of the \"Bella Donna\" album right down to the organ solo.\n \"Mabel Normand\" is one of her more rare demos, the song tells the tale of the long forgotten actress but here Stevie compares her own life to that of Mabel. The song dates back to the \"Rock A Little\" era and like \"Thousand Days\" or \"Mirror Mirror\" it has an almost rambling feel to the lyric, that's not a bad thing.\n The album's title \"24 Karat Gold\" was a demo that I could never quite get into, the version here though shines. From the opening lone bass riff, which rolls into a drum beat, the song just comes to life.\n One of my favorites from the album, \"Belle Fleur\" is another of the demos that I never got into, but once again, Stevie has transformed the song into a gem. The first minute of the song here is just a chugging drum beat that hooks you just before the song has it's proper start. I also like the banjo heard throughout the song.\n \"All The Beautiful Worlds\" is a great song period. It's got a haunting tone that has a very definite late 70's\/early 80's feel to it. Again here Stevie's vocals sound as strong and vibrant as they did in the 80's. With Sharon and Lori providing their background vocals, the song is classic Stevie.\n \"Lady\" was known for years among fans as \"Knocking On Doors\". Stevie wrote this back in the late 60's when she and Lindsey were trying to get noticed. Her voice has aged to perfection here. Just Stevie and a piano, that's all this song needs.\n With \"I Don't Care\" Stevie rocks out. The music track was written by Tom Petty guitarist Mike Campbell and Waddy Wachtel. It's got a swampy bluesy feel, a very different sound for Stevie. Stevie has said the end of the song lyrically was made up on the spot, honestly the whole song lyrically sounds improvised, but it works.\n \"Watch Chain\" written about Mick Fleetwood in the late 70's has retained much of the feel of the original demo. I've always liked this one and yet again, Stevie's vocals have somehow transported back to the 70's.\n \"Hard Advice\" is the sister song to 2001's \"That Made Me Stronger\", two songs written about the same conversation. In this case a conversation Stevie had with Tom Petty. This is a beautiful track.\n \"Carousel\" is a Vanessa Carlton song that Stevie did not write, however it's included here because it was one of Stevie's late mother's favorites.\n \"Blue Water\" is something of holy grail song among fans, written by Stevie with Sharon Celani back in the late 70's. I never cared for the demo, but once again the song has come alive here. She's helped out on this one with Lady Antebellum.\n \"Cathouse Blues\" was always something of a oddball among Stevie's demos. As with \"I Don't Care\" Stevie musically is trading new ground here, the song is given a jazzy treatment along with dixieland horns. Yes, it works.\n \"The Dealer\" has long been one of my favorites, one can assume it was one of Stevie's favorites as well, as she has recorded several demos of this. This version is slowed down a bit from the 1970's demo, and some of the excitement from the original demo is missing. However if you've never heard the demo, then there is much to like here.\n Closing out the album is \"She Loves Him Still\", another track she's attempted a few times. Some don't like the woodwind on this, I think it fits the song. Years have passed since she wrote this and she has moved on from whatever inspired her, but yet she sings it as if it was inspired just yesterday.\n\n Stevie said recently that she couldn't write these songs today. She's right, she's moved on and grown since these songs were written, in some ways these are really very simple songs. In every way though these are classic Stevie songs. This is very much the most pure Stevie album we've ever gotten.  Many of these songs probably wouldn't have been hits during the time they were written and that's probably why they were left behind. Looking back on these songs now, the heartbreak that inspired them has healed and now the songs are allowed to shine.\n In some ways this doesn't feel like a new album at all, it seems almost like a greatest hits album. At the same time it IS a new album filled with classic Stevie moments.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"This is a wonderful work of blues songs both covered and composed\/arranged by Ray.\nThe production is tastefully spare, avoiding overly lush arrangements and remaining raw but still darn smooth.\nMr. Charles has a wonderful ability to draw out and convey seemingly contradictory feelings in the same song; a sad song will be so beautiful  that it brings joy; a song of content carries undertones of trouble and impermanence that creates an insidious edge.\nI was turned onto this album when I read that Leonard Cohen played this frequently while writing on the Greek island of Hydra.

He's joined by the ECO, a fine quartet of soloists and his Amor Artis Chorale in a recording I should have heard years ago. For some reason, the Osanna movement gets played 3 times, rather than two times. I wonder if there was a mix-up during my downloading of this file. In addition, there are some annoying stops between tracks that should segue into each other, no doubt having something to do with the way MP3 tracks are coded for playback.\n\nThe set also includes the compete Brandenburgs under Somary, the Orchestral Suites with the Vienna State Opera Orchestra (aka the Vienna Philharmonic) under Felix Prohaska, French Suites with Andras Schiff, as well as recordings featuring Joseph Szigeti, Anton Heiller (wonderful in the Harpsichord Concerti) and others. The recorded sound on the Orchestral Suites is rather distant and shows its age.

{"text":"When it comes down great guilty pleasure artists, we often seem to forget what influence they've made on music today, especially back in the 80's. For those acts, we always will think of Madonna, Michael Jackson and Prince. But, for Billy Joel, he really made the best that was still coming around. 35 years after he broke ground with Piano Man, he has still dominated with his music on the radio. While he hasn't recorded an album since 1993's River Of Dreams, his music still stands the test of time because it is worth while from beginning to end. But for those who seem more interested in acts like Britney Spears and anyone who has been on American Idol, and doesn't own a Billy Hoel record, than this is a start to download for your MP3 player.\n\nThe Essential Billy Joel is a collection of over 30 tracks from Billy's long and successful career from the 70's, 80's and 90's. The songs here have all been remastered well, and chronicle a innocent man who has made the music of our times. The collection includes a lot of great standards he has made his own for over 35 years like Piano Man, River Of Dreams, We Didn't Start The Fire, the delight diddy Uptown Girl, and The Longest Time, all the way to #1 hits like My Life, It's Still Rock N' Roll To Me and Allentown. There is so much that is great in music, but there are a few of his great songs that were sadly overlooked like You're Only Human (Second Wind), Modern Woman and a few other good songs. But, those are small complaints, because those songs were only minor hits. Instead, the collectin includes some of his songs from his 2001 classical pop album instead.\n\nAll in all, The Essential Billy Joel is a very strong and standard greatest hits album from beginning to end that is fun and a joy to listen to, whether you're a hard core fan, or anyone who is new to Billy Joel's songs. This album is definitely a great purchase to download off the internet, or buy from your local record store. Even though Billy Joel hasn't made anything new in awhile, his music is still making us go to extremes.\n\nSongs: B+\n\nPrice: B 1\/2+\n\nRemastering: A-\n\nOverall: B+","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I fell in love with the single \"Rehab\" when I first heard it on the radio.  It was something different and original. Unique.  There aren't words to describe this great song!  Amy Winehouse has such a great voice.  It's perfect for the bleusy music she sings on this album.  If you like Joss Stone, then this album's for you.  You can tell Amy has had many different musical influences.  To be  honest when I first heard \"Rehab\" I thought the singer was black.  Her voice is that good!  She sings to kind of an old fashioned style of music, allowing her to have fans of all ages.  Older people may enjoy the old fashioned bluesy feel of her music and younger fans will enjoy a mainstream feel of her songs.  This is one of the best albums of 2007 and I highly reccomend this if you enjoyed \"Rehab\" on the radio.  It deserved to be a hit and so does this album.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Grimm isn't as bluesy as he was on AGT (from his songs listed on another website, I didn't watch the show) but that isn't a negative. This CD seems to find all avenues of pop\/rock and blues. A tad country, a tad honkytonk. Vocally, Grimm comes across as emotionally raw, exposed and vulnerable as if some lady hurt him pretty badly. Fallin' is truly brutal. It may be an Alicia Keys helmed song but Michael Grimm has clearly lived it a time or two. This will be an odd comparison but this CD reminds me of Josh Groban's latest, Illuminations, wherein JG tried something different with much less success. Voices do need to be great, as is Groban's, but material matters. Grimm, mixing in the other styles, nailed it.\n\n  While I am rating this as five stars but it isn't perfect. It isn't Grimms' singing or the production value that I find fault with - it's the duet with Ann Wilson nor do I care for song #6, Champagne and Wine. But I am more of a root beer and Aqua Fina kinda lady so that's just that. The duet with Wilson struggles because she doesn't seem able to keep up with Michael. It could be any back-up singer and I relish that song so it was a bit disappointing for me. The other duet with Travis Tritt, includes a vocal misfire by Tritt but it's still the better of the two. Even with the Tritt bobble towards the end. All in all, this CD is a reminder that America did pick the right winner last run of AGT. And I didn't even watch the show, just heard of MG by word of mouth. This is one sincere album.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I love the song \"Gun Song\". This is a great song about not owning a gun, but finding it hard to escape the presence of guns.  I like songs that try to advocate non violence. A few of these songs in the album are about trying to find a sense of independence in the world.  \"Sleep On The Floor\" and \"Angela\" are two beautiful songs that communicate this theme perfectly.  Wesley Schultz is a talented song writer.  His songs make me think about the world I am living in and my place in it. \"Cleopatra\" is a song about finding love at the wrong time.  I think I am not the only person who can relate to the lyrics of this song  I love the guitar playing on this song.  It sounds very upbeat.  \"Ophelia\" is a sweet love song.  The piano playing by Jeremiah Fraites is superb here. \"In The Light\" is a song that puts my mind at ease.  The guitar playing and piano playing are just so soothing on this song.  I will listen to this song each time I am stressed out and it will make feel better.  \"Gale Song\" is another beautiful song.

That being said, Kris has managed to personalize this song.  He has really made it his own.  The emotion that he puts into the song pretty much makes up for the awful lyrics.  Kris' emphais on the feeling of the song and on certain words makes all of the difference.\n\nThis is still not the best song in the world, but Allen's talent for getting to the heart of a song, even one as cheesy as this one, can't be ignored.

It feels more like it tries to bring in that crossover feeling acts like Taylor Swift and The Dixie Chicks had shown in making that same way into the mainstream. I really thought it was alright, but not deeply as strong as their title track displayed, which was absolutely more to bridge over.

{"text":"Warrants eighth album, Rockaholic is just another piece of hard rock heavily influenced by the likes of Guns N Roses, AC-DC, The Scorpions, and Poison. So just so were clear, there is basically no innovation present on this 2012 release. But even if it sounds like youve heard some of these songs before, their sheer live energy, contagious hooks, memorable vocal patterns, and inspiring guitar leads are plentiful enough to outweigh anything negative or lackluster.\n\nThe album opens with Sex Aint Love, a really simple yet equally as catchy and infectious number with a Brian Johnson-style shout-worthy chorus. The next couple of cuts, the wailing Innocence Gone and Snake, are both highlighted by ripping, borderline wailing, and positively air-guitar-able solos. And Dustys Revenge is crunchy and confrontational, despite beginning with an acoustic guitar. But it is then, around the mid-section, that the album seems to drag a little bit, thanks to the inclusion of the mostly-acoustic Home, What Love Can Do, and the almost completely unremarkable Lifes A Song. But even these songs have some merit, as they all feature memorably soaring vocals\/lyrics, grumbling bass, and well-placed cymbal crashes. And despite these three less-than-thrilling and\/or irresistible moments, the energy that the band captures in up-tempo hard rockers like Show Must Go On compensates for any sub-superb songs, and does so by being a vibrant and bouncy anthem with more good guitar solo work and wailing vocals.\n\nAnd fear not because the album concludes on a strong note, with Cocaine Freight Train being an up-tempo and energetic chugger with industrial-strength guitar hooks, (what sounds like) a wailing harmonica run, and catchy, and even borderline anthemic choruses. A little bit of whammy-bar-soaked guitar work is also included, here, and it is also on Candy Man, which follows up the unremarkable Found Forever in fashion by being a whammy bar\/wah pedal-worshipping hard rocker. Next we have Sunshine, a bass-driven rawker with fat, grumbling bass lines, solid guitar licks, a catchy main groove, and some wah-drenched soloing. And then, following Tears In The City, a somber acoustic ballad, Warrant storm back as hungrily as ever with The Last Straw, which is a briskly chugging metal song, thus making it quite possibly the albums heaviest and most aggressive moment.\n\nRockaholic might be a pretty inconsistent and less-than-amazing effort with a handful of forgettable songs. But, on the whole, it is a very decent (and certainly, consistently listenable) affair from a band that has routinely kicked out effort after eminently enjoyable effort for the past twenty-four-plus years. As such, Warrant definitely and once again, uh, warrant a listen from all serious hard rock and heavy metal aficionados.","classification":4,"fold":7}

Two vocalists trade off on this piece (female and male), accompanied by guitar, drum, strings orchestration, and clarinet here and there (I believe).

Interesting mix of classical strings, acoustic guitar, blues electric organ and a jazzy clarinet. Each providing a light touch of different genres. Who would have thought of putting this all together and that it would blend well. I like the voices, the male voice is baritone and has a slightly rough edge that is an interesting contrast to his female counterpart (and doesn't sound like all the other male voices I've heard).

{"text":"In the years that both The Roots and John Legend the general world around them had actually returned to a state very similar to the way it was in the late 60's\/early 70's. Political and social tensions are running rampant yet again among almost everyone and so it seemed fitting that when these two soulful and funky musical entities got together it would be these issues rather than ones of a romantic nature would be dealt with. After seeing a sneak peak video about the making of this album I was convinced that Legend,Questlove and Malik Yusef were on yet another mission of \"saving music\" here and sacrificing high quality production values and original material by spouting a \"real instrument\" only ethic while interpreting songs by Curtis Mayfield,Marvin Gaye and Bill Withers. As commendable as this goal was it often has the effect of diminishing the music itself when it's bogged down with such heavy baggage so I tossed it aside. Upon hearing parts of it I decided to give this album a chance and,I must admit it's not quite what it's own hype was delivering on. True it isn't perfect and on some occasions the \"naturalness\" ethic does stick out more than it should. But the very fact that this album will DEFINATELY not \"save music\" is actually part of it's charms. This album is made up primarily of cover versions of message centered songs such as \"Hard Times\",\"Compared To What\",\"Hang On In There\",\"Wholy Holy\" and an 11 minute version of Bill Withers anti war story song \"I Can't Write Left Handed\". Legend brings a lot of passion and life vocally to these songs and the music is genuinely funky with it's scratch guitars and basslines,even if the live drums are played by Questlove in a somewhat hollow manner. On the other hand some of the lumbering,downbeat nature of these songs may not make them quite as condusive to \"partying your troubles away\" much the way the originals are. And that is where the saving music ethic comes in; John and The Roots seem to take these songs a little too seriously to infuse them with much joy and hope. A bit more potent in that respect are the Yusef penned \"Little Ghetto Boy\", a wonderfully poetic groove that tells it's story with a glimmer of hope for the character involved. Same goes for the albums closer in the gospel fueled \"Shine\",same going for the reggae jam \"Humanity (Love The Way It Should Be)\". There are elements to the album that will detract from it's appeal to some and a lot of them have to do with the way the artists themselves come at the music. But considering the very uneven quality of John Legends previous album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Evolver\/dp\/B001E7OO2I\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Evolver<\/a>&nbsp;this could be the start of something big in terms of rediscovering a positive musical direction for all parties involved.","classification":4,"fold":7}

Written by the legendary songwriting team of Burt Bacharach and Had David \"Make It Easy On Yourself\" would become a Top 20 hit. The song had been a hit for Jerry Butler some three years earlier.

All other songs are covers (like Praise the Invisible) or remakes of songs released on other 3D albums. There isn't one fast song out of 22 tracks! Every song is basically a midtempo ballad, which is OK but once you've listened to all 22 tracks, it feels like you've had the same song on repeat for an hour and 18 minutes.\n\nI prefer some variety in an album. I also wish Third Day would get back to making rock music. Conspiracy No 5 is their best album and each one since then has gotten softer.

{"text":"After the daring but critically unsuccessful 'Kilroy was here' came six years of separation for the Styx boys, releasing various solo albums in that time, only to reconvene in 1990 without Tommy Shaw. The product is 'Edge of the Century', which, instead, featured the credible Glen Burtnik.\n\n'Edge of the Century' is a very careful album, no daring concepts or experimental songs. Instead, it is a slab of predictable rockers and ballads, with very little variety. 'Edge' has a flavour of hair-band music, which was all the rage at the time. So this should be a weak Styx album, and, admittedly, it is disappointing upon the first listen.\n\nHowever, while 'Edge of the century' is generic and artistically dull, it succeeds with quality songwriting. DeYoung's ballads soar with uplifting melodies and passionate vocal harmonies, while Burtnik's rockers are fun and catchy. The only deviation from predictability, 'All in a day's work', is a real gem. It mixes acoustic rootsy musings from Glen Burtnik with a melodious, classically-tinged chorus.\n\nSo, a fairly uneventful album, but 'Edge of the Century' has enough genuine substance to become a keeper in a discerning music lovers collections, rating ***1\/2","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"NF's first release that I listened to didn't impress me too much. I can't rap to save my life, but the I'm Free EP seemed boring and standard flair to me. Many people loved it, but I felt the one-gear speed, and the all-too familiar \"People doubted me\" theme was all that was being used, rendering the album to the absolute peak of general.\n\nNot so with this self-titled EP. Ever since his collaboration with Flame on the exceptional track, Start Over, NF has added a new dimension to his style with his nice singing skills. The release starts with All I Have, another song that adheres to the doubt theme. Yet NF throws in some terrific lines and the awesome flows and nice hook make it a standout track, even with the tired theme. Thankfully, NF throws in some variety this time around. Wake Up and This Thing Called Love have different, albeit simple Christian themes. Both are good tunes, and benefit from his singing, and there are some nice punch lines. Hands Up and Only One throw in a bit of a curveball with some rock and club sounds, and while I'm not a fan of rock-rap, these songs were totally fine with me. Probably the biggest positive for this release is the raw sound and the utter intensity NF brings with each track. He is passionate and excited about what he does, and its infectious.\n\nI don't see the Eminem similarities at all. They're both white, and they're both talented. That's all. They don't sound alike, nor do they really rap about the same things. NF is his own capable rapping self, and that is plenty fine with me. I'm sure its fine with him too.\n\nBreakdown:\nAll I Have: 4.5\nWake Up: 3.5\nHands Up: 3.5\nOnly One: 3.5\nThis Thing Called Love: 4.5\nJust Being Me: 4","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"This one's my first Katy Perry cd, so I don't have anything else to judge it against other than what it sounds like to my uninitiated ears.  And what I'm hearing is a lot of Autotunes and ProTools filtering, layering and remixing on every track.  And it doesn't help that nearly every track ends the same way with an extended reverberating echoed tone or note.  I'm not sure if there's even any actual instruments used on this one.\n\nAll the tracks are pretty short- only a handful make the four-minute mark- and utterly formulaic.  You can practically tell what's gonna happen when- when the bridge is gonna hit, when the reverb will kick in, etc- which starts to get boring fast.  There's kind of a flow as the later tracks sound more mature and introspective and much less glam and glitz.\n\nSome highlights:\nRoar- by now we all know this one.  Catchy, with a good hook yet still like something more along the lines of Selena Gomez' teen queen stuff.\n\nBirthday- definitely an early 80s New Wave\/R&B feel to it; more old skool yet still fully computerized.  Good cheesy fun to nod your head to.\n\nWalking On Air- straight EDM\/House with an 80s\/90s club vibe, this one's like some Taylor Dane or Cece Peniston.  Even Perry's treated voice sounds similar to them on it.\n\nUnconditionally- finally something resembling a song from a grown woman.  Lyrically it reminds me of Alanis Morrisette, and thanks to the engineering some of Perry's high notes sound a lot like her as well, which really ain't bad a thing here.\n\nDark Horse (feat. Juicy J)- did Kanye West produce this one?  No?  You sure?  Cause thanks to that rap they inserted in it really kinda bites.\n\nThis Is How We Do- remember Jamie Foxx's Blame It On The Alcohol?  Take it down a few notches and rework it into a teen friendly anthem of a club vamp.  The beats are alright; it kind of grows on you.\n\nInternational Smile- some Daft Punk stuff going on here.  Synths and vocorder are really popping on this one and her voice is mixed well with it.  Another one that gets your head nodding.\n\nDouble Rainbow- slower, moodier pulses and beats on this one are a nice change of pace.  And I really like the lyrical sentiment of two souls in harmony on this one.\n\nBy The Grace Of God- mostly piano based at first, it morphs into another attempt at overproduced maturity, which is what drags it down.\n\nIt Takes Two- sharing responsibility when things go wrong is difficult.  But this song makes it a little easier to ask for forgiveness and shoulder your part of the blame.  Not so much techno-filtering and the more emotional lyrics in this one makes for one of the better tracks on the cd.\n\nAll in all Prism ain't bad; like Miley Cyrus' Bangerz, it's an absolute reflection of the state of popular music, but infinitely better than that thing.  But it also shows what's wrong with it: too much reliance on tricks, smoke and mirrors instead of vocals, instruments and lyrics, plus still trying to straddle the line between tween girl and club queen like Britney Spears tried to do. Which is a shame because I get the impression Perry really doesn't have to rely on either one of those if she doesn't want to.","classification":3,"fold":7}

For their latest single, Dead Man Walking from their sophmore album  Science & Faith, it shows that they really are more than just a few lads from the U.K. just serious with their music. I really was surprised. It really sounds refreshing to the sound. I really hope that keep it up, and do what acts like Lady Gaga and Rihanna couldn't do, and that is keep coming out with strong music that is not about flash and flare, just about heart.\n\nSong: B 1\/2+","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"\"Tre!\" Is the final of the trilogy by Green Day begun by September's \"Uno!\", and it opens with the delightful retro ballad \"Brutal Love\" with jangly guitars, fleeting horns and a tinge of Soul and Doo Wop, followed by a pair of perfunctory rockers \"Missing You\": and \"8th Avenue Serenade\" which while not bad never quite rise above the ordinary. \"Drama Queen\" is another nice ballad with a retro feel, followed by the upbeat \"X-Kid\" which is just okay.\n\n\"Sex, Drugs & Violence\" regains the zest and vigour missing from the earlier rockers and sounds more like Green Day. From here on, the band sound rejuvenated; \"Little Boy Named Train\", \"Amanda\", \"Walk Away\" (with an interesting key change in the final minute), and the 6 minute musical suite \"Dirty Rotten Bastards\" (with some great guitar solos). \"99 Revolutions\" is frenetic paced, while closing is the theatrical piano\/string ballad \"The Forgotten\" which featured on the soundtrack \"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2\".

{"text":"As most Dead fans know, the likelihood of any given Grateful Dead studio album sounding good and not disappointing is pretty slim.  For whatever reason, the magic that was created onstage never quite made it to the studio.  \"From the Mars Hotel\", while nowhere nearing deserving of the title great or inspired, is nonetheless a solid and listenable affair.\n  The strength of the material paves way for a lot of this album's success.  Songs that would soon become live standards- \"Scarlet Begonias\", \"U.S. Blues\", \"Ship of Fools\"- mixed with instant classics that we wished we heard more of live- \"China Doll\", \"Unbroken Chain\", \"Loose Lucy\"- mixed with two of the strangest songs the Dead ever recorded- \"Pride of Cucamonga\", \"Money Money\"- and the whole becomes this enjoyable, never boring little ride.  Phil Lesh is represented twice, with his \"Unbroken Chain\" pushing the Dead's musical boundaries and forcing them to step up their game, with success.  Jerry dominates the album, providing a timeless ballad in \"China Doll\", some loose funk with \"Loose Lucy\", and a calypso classic in \"Scarlet Begonias\".  Bob is the only one who strikes out, with the horrible but hilariously so, \"Money Money\".\n  As with all the recent re-releases, this album also comes with a handful of live and studio outtakes from the same era, and while not as inspired or valuable as other albums' bonus tracks, there are some nice treats here. Live versions of \"Scarlet Begonias\" and \"Let It Rock\" are the obvious highlights, along with live curios \"Money Money\" and \"Wave That Flag\", which is essentially an early version of this album's \"U.S. Blues\".  The remaining three bonus tracks are studio outtakes, providing an interesting look into how the Dead build upon and re-imagine basic tracks.\n  The production is clean without being too slick, and at times, the band sounds similar to its stealthier live incarnation.  Again, in no way a great album, but by Dead standards, one of the better studio efforts.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"In my mind, this CD is what east coast hip hop should sound like.  This album had an impact in that was summed up well by one reviewer that said: \"When this album dropped in '96, everybody's ears perked up a bit and heads turned.\"  This was one of those albums that you could turn on and just zone out to.  Tracks like \"The Yearn\", \"Music Makes Me High\", and \"Get Up\" were sure to get any party started while cuts like \"Legal Drug Money\", \"All Right\", \"Straight From The Ghetto\", and \"1,2,3\" were equally effective tales of ghetto life.  Then you throw in classics tracks like \"Jeeps, Lex Coups, Bimaz, & Benz\", \"Lifestyles Of The Rich & Shameless\", and \"Renee\" and you have as good a rap album as you're gonna find on the east coast.  Even the intro is hot without taking all day to get to the point.  This is easily the best album released by the Lost Boyz.  It seems that Mr Cheeks leads the charge while Freaky Tah picks up the slack.  Tah doesn't rhyme much, but he does manage to spit a few bars on \"Legal Drug Money\", \"The Yearn\", \"All Right\", and \"1,2,3\".  And when he's not rhyming, he's ad libbing in the background on most songs (don't front like I was the only one that was singing along with Tah in most of those songs).  There are a few shortcomings that keep this album from achieving classic status.  Freaky Tah has a very simplistic flow that can come off as boring from time to time (but not often).  Then there are tracks like \"Da Game\" and \"Is This The Part\" that could've been left off the album and no one would've missed it.  Aside from those mishaps, the rest of the album is flawless.  It's been 8 years since this album came out (damn, that was 8 years ago?!) and you can still zone out to it in 2004.  Overall, this album is near classic with party jams and street tales that are effective in their purposes.  This CD is definitely worth your money if you're considering buying it.\nStandout Tracks: 1 2 3, Legal Drug Money, Straight From Da Ghetto (My Favorite), Renee, Jeeps Lex Coups Bimaz & Benz, & Get Up","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"1. Ayesha Says (Intro) - NA\/5\n\n2. Strange Fruition - 4\/5 A decent way to start out the album. The hook is kind of weird and almost feels like a gap in the middle of the song, but Lupe comes back in before it gets too unbearable. The instrumentals are decent being dominated by a violin during Lupe's parts, and the Benjamin parts are mostly just a beat with some computerized whispering.\n\n3. ITAL (Roses) - 5\/5 This was almost immediately a fan favorite. It's got a little more of an uplifting sound, while Lupe's flow matches the song well. Lupe does a little bit of a half rap, half singing chorus which again fits well.\n\n4. Around My Way (Freedom Ain't Free) - 5\/5 Lupe's lead single from the album. He uses the hip-hop classic \"They Reminice Over You (T.R.O.Y)\" by Pete Rock as the backing sample. Lupe fits the beat very well as he lays down a couple of verses that all seem to be comparable to the others. He speeds things up a little bit to do the hook, which turns out to be one of the best parts of the song.\n\n5. Audubon Ballroom - 5\/5 I smiled the first time I heard this song. It has an humbly epic feel to it. Lupe goes solo which is great to hear, especially knowing he attempted singing. His singing actually isn't bad, in fact it's one of the more memorable moments from the album, in a good way. A great song overall.\n\n6. B*tch Bad - 3\/5 B*tch bad comes out a mixed plate. He sends a good message through the song using three \"acts\". In between the acts he lays down an incredibly mediocre and ultimately lazy hook, where he chants \"B*tch bad, woman good, lady better, they misunderstood\". Lupe paints a half finished picture through the three acts, with the third hurrying to put it all together. Lupe has been known to have deep lyrics, but with how blunt he was with the lyrics this time around, it comes off as kind of bland. The song never really sucks you in, though the beat is somewhat enjoyable.\n\n7. Lamborghini Angels - 4\/5 The best way to put Lamborghini Angels is a decent love child between \"Around My Way\" and \"B*tch Bad\". The lyrics are a little more evened out compared to \"B*tch Bad\", as well as more controversial and even kind of disturbing. The beat is good, but still doesn't match up with what Lupe has done on \"Food & Liqor\" and \"The Cool\".  Overall a good song.\n\n8. Put Em Up - 5\/5 This song was absolutely refreshing. It was released a few days before the album dropped and it reminded me so much of \"The Cool\" I'm not kidding when I say it could of been a part of \"The Cool\", and all for the better. The hook, the rapping, everything reminds you of the old Lupe.\n\n9. Heart Donor - 3\/5 This is somewhat of an elevator music version of Strange Fruition with a better hook. Poo Bear does a decent job with the hook and Lupe, like always, does great. It almost seems like a filler track. Nothing outstanding here.\n\n10. How Dare You - 4\/5 How Dare You is a little bit of a disappointment knowing it was supposed to be a single before being axed by Battle Scars. It seems a lot like an original Food and Liquor song, which is actually kind of nice. The title kind of throws you off a bit since the song has a happier vibe to it.\n\n11. Battle Scars - 5\/5 Okay, this wasn't really Lupe's song in the first place, but if you want to sell albums you'll probably want some radio time. The song does a great job fitting in lyric wise with the rest of the songs, though it kind of sticks out as the most mainstream song on the album, for better or for worse. Lupe does great with his two verses and Guy Sebastian the same with his parts. A good song, just one that doesn't really fit in great with the rest of the album.\n\n12. Brave Heart - 4\/5 Another kind of filler track. The hook is done well as Poo Bear does a chanting chorus which fits the beat very well. Not bad, but ultimately forgettable.\n\n13. Form Follows Function - 5\/5 Lupe's favorite song on the album is not a disappointment. The instrumentals are excellent with the saxophone coming and going every once in a while, it just fits the song well. It may not be the \"masterpiece\" Lupe promised, but it's still a pretty good track.\n\n14. Cold War - 3\/5 Jane $$$ throws in a good hook on this one which is good because the track almost crashes and burns beyond that. Lupe surprisingly gets kind of boring, the instrumentals do absolutely nothing to suck you in.\n\n15. Unforgivable Youth - 5\/5 After my first time listening to this track I was reminded of the first time listening to \"The Instrumental\" off of Lupe's first album. which is freaking awesome since that is easily my favorite Lupe song of all time, not to mention one of my top 25 songs of all time. Now whether it will ever hit that status is unknown, but I'm a sucker for piano beats in rap songs, and this is one of the best I've ever heard. Without a doubt my favorite track from the album.\n\n16. Hood Now (Outro) - 3\/5 Lupe lazily shouts \"Hood Now\" multiple times over a synth dominated beat. It gets pretty boring after a while, there isn't really anything about it that will keep you listening.\n\nClosing Remarks: Lasers was almost panned by audiences everywhere, and for a good reason. It wasn't the Lupe we all know and love, this is. After five years we finally have the Lupe Fiasco album fans have wanted, and it was one darn good ride. Now I'm going to go listen to Unforgivable Youth again.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 8.5\/10","classification":5,"fold":7}

I already love the sound of just rain and the added wind is a very nice touch.  On a lot of other wind tracks the wind is low and kind of hard to hear at a lower volume.  With this track, however, the wind is nice and loud with the rain as a backdrop.  The wind sounds kind of eerie, but that's what I like about the sound of wind; it brings back memories of being curled up inside during a storm.  If you like the sound of rain and don't mind the eerie sound of wind, then I definitely recommend giving this track a buy.

{"text":"Linkin Park's hard rock sound on this album represents a return to the past. While this is not a bad thing, it would have been more interesting if it were accompanied by some sort of evolution. A little bold experimentation would have been welcome.\n\nStill, it is generally a good, loud, hard rock album, and maybe that's enough. There are some segu&eacute;s between some of the tracks that give it a loose unity. I read that Mike explained the theme of the album in relation to its title (that Linkin Park is hunting to bring back the energy and soul of rock), but I also find a lot of very timely war talk (considering current events) or at least war allusions. In \"Keys To The Kingdom\", we are told \"It's our Final War\/Tell me what's worth fighting for\". In \"All For Nothing\", \"Why you debate what it can take to instigate a war?\" In \"War\", \"There's no peace\/Only war...You better be prepared to fight!\" In \"Wastelands\", \"When tomorrow disappears\/When the future slips away\/And your hope turns into fear\/In the wastelands of today\". And in \"A Line In The Sand\", \"Today, I look for a sign\/With flames in my hands...And it came, like fire from below\/Your greed led the call\/My flag had to fall\".\n\nThere are some musical elements that stand out. \"The Summoning\" is a brief techno\/industrial instrumental that serves as a sort of intro to \"War\"; and \"War\" features a psychedelic guitar solo, something you don't hear every day. In \"Wastelands\", I like the line \"John with no Yoko\", which I interpret to mean that Yoko was a \"peace\" influence on John. The instrumental backing of \"Rebellion\" is frantically fast, and it works. \"Drawbar\" is a pretty, melodic piano instrumental. And the final track, \"A Line In The Sand\", opens with what is practically chanting, then launches into full hard rock, then alternates between the two with a rap thrown in. It sort of sums everything up as the most complex track of the set. I especially like the opening lines, \"Today, we stood on the wall\/We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns\/We laughed at it all.\" It reminds me of Bowie's \"Heroes\".\n\nThe ballads \"Until It's Gone\" and \"Final Masquerade\" are pretty formulaic. On the other hand, \"Mark The Graves\", is a semi-ballad which is special because it manages to include hard rock and screaming, an unusual mix.\n\nAll in all, not a bad album. And I don't think this is Linkin Park's last word. I think they will come back with something big, something stupendous! I hope so.","classification":4,"fold":7}

Now, with Selena pushing 21, she is moving in a more mature direction with a \"Come and Get It\".  Selena's lyrics and voice are more mature and the beats are sexier.\n\n  Unlike the 'trying to shock everyone' adult moves by child stars such as Miley Cyrus, Selena is definitely growing into adulthood normally and naturally.

Right After this hit parade they made #1 hit with Back To The Future theme song POWER OF LOVE.\n\nThe Opener THE HEART OF ROCKN' ROLL starts with upbeat heart rhythm giving tribute to the places where the great rockn' roll music was born. HEART AND SOUL is their trademark rock sounds with rhythm and blues flavor. BAD IS BAD and HONKY TONK BLUES also are nice blues flavored tracks. I WANT A NEW DRUG tries heavier rock sound with an excelellent guitar solo. WALKING ON THE THIN LINE blends techno pop beats while IF THIS IS IT nicely mixes blues and power ballad with guitar solo.\n\nVerdict: Typical 80s All-Hits Album but an excellent one.\n\nRating: 92 out of 100\n\nRecommended for wide range of 80s rock fans","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I knew Tower of Power loved to use lots of horns based on the few songs I've heard before going into East Bay Grease, but I guess I had no idea they liked to use horns *this* much, and *this* loudly!  Constant horns all over the place, and often times soulful vocal melodies overriding everything else to a great extent.  Pretty good stuff though.  If there's one thing you can't fault Tower of Power for, it's not being boisterous enough, haha!  This band takes the supposed high energy level of other bands at the time, reinvents said excitement and shoots it through the roof!\n\nNot a single song is below 5 and a half minutes either.  \"Knock Yourself Out\" opens with nice marching horns and somewhat messy vocals, but perhaps what sounds like messy vocals is just a very enthusiastic and uncontrollable lead singer!  The background vocals provide the \"Knock yourself out woooh!\" part.  Solid melodic sax solo in the middle too.  I really like this song.  \"Social Lubrication\" opens with steamy bluesy guitar lines before quickly shifting into a funkier and soulful direction.  I feel the vocals are a little unfocused\/uninspiring here which makes the song sound a bit clunky, but I like the horns during the chorus.  The vocals remind me of Terry Kath of Chciag fame a little bit during the middle part.  I like the \"Everyone's got their own way\" part because it's sung so honestly.  The vocal melody gets more intense near the end.  Overall decent song but not one of my favorites.\n\n\"The Price\" provides refreshing horns mixed with funk in the beginning.  Geat driving verse melody.  \"It's a hard thing to say but that's the price I gotta pay, the price is too much my darling\" is a VERY strong melody and lyrics.  Lots of horns decorating the song and making it stand out boisterously, and a nice guitar solo at the end.  \"Back on the Streets Again\" has a quality funky groove and sincere vocals about survival and making a return back on the streets in apparent grand fashion based on the lead singers confident demeanor.  Decent though relatively messy saxophone solo in the middle, and the rhythm is notable for doing some tricky stuff.  \"The Skunk, the Goose and the Fly\" is funky with cheerful\/playful vocals.  More exceedingly boisterous singing with funny lyrics \"Drunk as a skunk, loose as a goose!\"  AWESOME guitar solo.  Wow if this band ever wanted to jam on the guitar for an extended period of time, it would be incredibly good.  I wonder if they DID jam when performing this live.\n\n\"Sparkling in the Sand\" is my favorite song on here by FAR.  Instead of being a horn-drenched tune with a loud soulful vocal melody, it goes in a quieter gentler direction while keeping the soul sound completely in place.  It opens with beautiful dreamy flutes.  \"When God made you he had a lot to do, in a day or two you were my dream come true\" is a funny and beautifully sung line.  Reminds me of Blood, Sweat and Tears when the brass instruments arrive.  There are no words to describe how beautiful the vocal melody is while the lyrics emphasis the subject of love.  The flute that jams throughout the song is really amazing, as is the trumpet solo later on.  The jazzy tempo change at the very end is beautiful too.  \"You're a diamond sparkling in the sand\" is a memorable line.\n\nOverall, well if you like a LOT of horns, constant horns, this is the album for you.  There's also brief guitar solos, funky rhythms and constant soulful vocal melodies, but in the end other than the vocal melodies, nothing else is as instantly noticeable as the horns.  It can be a bit much to take overall, but I still thoroughly enjoy East Bay Grease and highly recommend it.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I think the biggest glaring problem with this album is that it continues PATD's trend of copying whatever their parent band Fall Out Boy is doing. This album sounds exactly like American Beauty\/American Psycho. The beats, synthesizers, and auto tune vocals are the exact same tune. However, that doesn't exactly mean that this album is bad. There are some good songs like \"Victorious\" and \"Emperor's New Clothes\" and a couple other ones but everything else is just kinda meh. I think they did it better on their last album. I think Brendon being the only sole member left isn't necessary a good thing. The band is now more of a solo project than an actual band. I have to give some respect to Brendon for doing all the instruments. If you liked PATD's last album then I'm sure you'll enjoy this one even more, but for others, I encourage you to look elsewhere.","classification":3,"fold":7}

That honestly is the case with her latest song Alejandro, from The Fame Monster. I really didn't find the some to be anything really special nor strong. It really felt like she was taking the page from Madonna with Gag's take on style of La Isla Bonita. Sadly for Lady Gaga, the song really isn't a definitive song for her.

{"text":"I pre-ordered this album, which allows you to grab three tracks: The Threat is Real, Dystopia, and Fatal Illusion.  So far, I've listen to them on repeat for extended periods of time, one at a time, to get my feels.\n\nI believe Fatal Illusion was the first video (audio track) tease\/release.  I like it around the :58 mark when it gets past its fills (Ellefson's bass is sweet). So from there until the end, it is just killer and guttural.  It got me excited to see what Megadeth (this version) would put out.\n\nThe Threat is Real reminds me of old school Megadeth. It doesn't have the classic step-down like Peace Sells or So Far, So Good(1986.1988), but sounds like it could fit with Youthanasia (1994).\n\nTitle track, Dystopia, has an updated feel for Megadeth. This doesn't always prove to be a good thing, but I think they nailed this one.\n\nMegadeth is one of my all-time favorite bands.  I was 'with' them since Killing is My Business...but I'm not the biggest fan after Risk.  I did come back for Thirteen, though. So, so far, Dystopia is lining up to be a solid album.\n\nI eagerly await the full release.\n\nNot sure what's up with all the negative voting - but so it goes.","classification":5,"fold":7}
{"text":"After Diana Ross and the Supremes, Martha Reeves & the Vandellas were Motown's biggest female stars.  But whereas the Supremes offered listeners sophistication the music of Reeves was more in the gospel tradition.  Reeves got her big break when she was a secretary at Motown and Mary Wells failed to show up for a recording session.  The song, \"I'll Have to Let Him Go,\" which is not included in this collection, was the first song credited to the suddenly created Martha & the Vandellas.  The original Vandellas were Annette Sterling and Rosalind Holmes, although the lineup changed over the years; the name came from combining a couple of Detroit favorites, Van Dyke Street and local singer Della Reese).  The group's second single \"Come and Get These Memories\" made the Top 5 of the R&B charts and the girls were on their way.  Other Top 5 hits included \"Dancing in the Street,\" \"\"Nowhere to Run,\" \"Jimmy Mack,\" \"I'm Ready for Love,\" \"(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave,\" and \"Honey Chile.\"  These danceable R&B hits made Martha & the Vandellas the chief rivals to the Supremes until 1968, when Reeves had a nervous breakdown after a bad acid trip.  The group disbanded after a farewell concert in Detroit in 1973 and after an undistinguished solo career away from Motown, Reeves was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Class of 1995.  This Millennium Collection offers up all of the group's hits, but is limited to only 11 cuts.  Consequently, while this album certainly covers the basics there is more of Martha & the Vandellas out there for you to enjoy.","classification":4,"fold":7}

Keying on the power ballads that were a staple of the late 80's and early 90's, the band plays to their strengths.  \"King Of Might Have Been\" is strong ballad that is faintly reminiscent of \"Hard To Say I'm Sorry\", \"Caroline\" has some meaty guitar riffs and \"Better\" is accentuated by the classic Chicago horn sound.  Only the album's opener, \"Feel\" which has a spacey trip hop beat, strays from their tried and true sound.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"As the title might imply, this is a very mellow album that might send you to sleep if you are in any way tired. But if you were to fall asleep while this CD is playing, you'd miss some great music. The book from which Shawn selected these carols and lullabies obviously contains many songs that are rarely heard these days, making this particularly interesting for those looking for something different, though there one song here that is famous all around the world - Silent night, which works as a lullaby as well as a carol.\n\nThe opening track, In the bleak midwinter, is a wonderful old English carol and it's great to hear this sung by an American - a rare occurrence. Rocking is another old English carol, one that is particularly suited to this album, being both a holiday song and a lullaby. All through the night is a carol I've heard before but recordings of it seem to be even rarer than Rocking and In the bleak midwinter.\n\nElsewhere, there are beautiful songs such as Windy nights (words by Robert Louis Stevenson), All the pretty li'l horses, Little road to Bethlehem and Love came down at Christmas. The final track is Close your eyes, so it seems that Shawn really does want you to fall asleep after that.\n\nThis is definitely not a typical Christmas album but very soothing - and very satisfying.","classification":5,"fold":7}

If your hoping that this album will stand on par with their earlier material then you may be disappointed however, I will say this is most certainly one of their better later career albums. I know sticking to the old stuff makes most people happy but after a while your going to get bored and crave something new. If you're already a fan of this group then this album is for you.

{"text":"The fact that Roger Waters has graced us with a new studio album, his first in 25 years, is a noteworthy moment in itself. But sometimes artists that we loved from decades ago come back with an album and we end up merely yearning for their younger selves. Thankfully, that's not the case with this album.  If you're a Pink Floyd fan, you'll really enjoy this. It could easily fit in with the style of late 70's Pink Floyd (minus David Gilmour's voice\/guitar), more than any of his other solo work. Lyrically, it falls in line with his excellent 1992 solo album \"Amused to Death.\" Both deal with the jaded modern response to war and refugees. It's incredibly timely and very consciously an act of resistance. While he's always been interested in the theme of war and its impacts on all those involved, this album is very conscious of the global state of social decay, most eloquently stated on the track Deja Vu:\n\n\"The temple's in ruins\nThe bankers get fat\nThe buffalo's gone\nAnd the mountain top's flat\nThe trout in the streams are all hermaphrodite\nYou lean to the left but you vote to the right\nAnd it feels like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu\nThe sun goes down and I'm still missing you\"","classification":5,"fold":7}

But after hearing from multiple sources that \"Africa\" was one of their best, I decided to give it a listen.  Turns out I'd heard it before, I just hadn't known the title or connected it to Toto at all.  And while I still prefer \"Rosanna\" over \"Africa,\" \"Africa\" is still a very enjoyable song, and makes me want to check out more by the band.\n\n\"Africa\" is a nice upbeat song, a well-done mix of pop and rock with a tune that's pleasant to listen to and good vocal harmonies.  The lyrics are somewhat generic -- despite the occasional Africa references (such as Kilimanjaro), it seems more like a generic love song than anything else.  Still, as another well-known band likes to say, \"some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs, and what's wrong with that?\"\n\nA pleasant song, and a good listen for anyone who enjoys Toto or '80s music in general.  Pairs nicely with \"Rosanna\" or anything by Starship or Journey.","classification":4,"fold":7}

For Sam Smith, whom has been new to making music for the past year, and has shown that simplicity with great music with Stay With Me.  But trying to follow up a smash, can be a hit and a miss as well. But for Sam, he has such a lovely and beautiful voice that definitely delivers much better than joke acts like Robin Thicke or Beyonce' Knowles. I'm Not The Only One, his second single from his American debut, In The Lonely Hour, is a sophisticated and classy song that really is delightful. The song definitely is a song that really works for Sam, and shows him ranking up there with Michael Buble' and greats like Rod Stewart and George Michael, whom have also shown real beauty from Blue-Eyed Soul.

{"text":"Let me state upfront that I wasn't aware of the Black Angels until a friend of mine, who knows my musical tastes quite well, directed me to them with this, their second album. I would not be not disappointed. (I confess that I have not heard the band's first album, 2006's \"Passover\", yet at this time, but I will seek that out shortly.)\n\n\"Directions to See a Ghost\" (11 tracks; 71 min.) starts off with a blast, \"You On The Run\", which at first reminds me immediately of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, but then the song evolves. \"Doves\" kicks off with thundering drums, only to be joined by even more thundering guitars, awash in reverb, just great. \"Science Killer\" starts with a great bass line, and eventually works into a frenzy, just great. \"Mission District\" reminded me of early Pink Floyd (Syd Barret-era). The energy throughout the album is fantasic, shoe-glazing psychedelic-influenced music at its best (and it's not a coincidence that the Black Angels are now on the same label as Brian Jonestown Massacre). Other highlights for me include the hard-charging \"Vikings\" and the closer, a 16 min. epic \"Snake In the Grass\" which goes on forever, but you never want it to end anyway, fabulous. In all, this album is just great, and sure to make my \"best of the year\" list.\n\nPlease note that simultaneously with the album, the band released an EP \"Black Angel Exit\" (4 tracks; 24 min.), which you could get by pre-ordering the album, or now at the band's shows (which is where I got it). It is a great companion to (and in the same vein as) the album, with the 9+ min. title track as the highlight. I had the good fortune to catch the Black Angels in concert here in Cincinnati recently in support of the new album, and they were nothing short of fantastic, a delight for any fan of live music. Meanwhile, \"Directions to See a Ghost\" is HIGHLY recommended!","classification":4,"fold":7}

I pre-ordered this one before the release date and it just arrived. It's currently on its first run through my CD player.\n\nOn the first play through I can say with certainty that this album is up to Mark Knopfler's usual high standards. With a few exceptions, it's definitely on the mellow side but Knopfler has a real talent for doing this kind of material and that talent shines through here.\n\nBottom line: another excellent Mark Knopfler album.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Blow, from Beyonce' Knowles self-titled record actually starts slow, and instead feels much weaker in voice and heart. She instead tries to be a bit more sensual and instead it blows up from her face badly. It is not what she had with Diva or the wasted Countdown from her 4 record or Check On It. It instead feels like she is singing something she had made before from her music. I think instead Beyonce' Knowles needs to grow up and find better from her voice, so it doesn't feel like she has blown it.\n\nSong: D+","classification":2,"fold":7}

{"text":"Eminem isn't really a Rap God. The title is just a metaphor. Rappers have been calling themselves \"King\" since Run-DMC's second album. They've been calling themselves \"God\" for a long time too, as Wu-Tang fans can attest, but the boastful declaration has received a recent surge in popularity. Kanye West's Yeezus album, released a few months ago, includes a song entitled I Am A God. Jay-Z is also one on his album. It's a new trend among popular rappers. What separates Eminem from the rest is that he generally raps better than they do. So when he follows along and calls himself a God, which the most religious of his detractors will probably consider blasphemous, it's a little closer to the truth.\n\nThe problem is that the song doesn't really match the claim. Not to say that it's a lackadaisical affair. It seems Eminem put a lot of effort into composing these verses, the third of which lasts for nearly sixty bars. It's just that rhyming a complex array of words at Supersonic speed doesn't compensate for a lack of clever or otherwise interesting things to say. The \"Columbine\" line is a nostalgic highlight; listen for the gun sound effect; and the Ray J bit is sort of funny, but most of this is just a long-winded Eminem rapping to a generic beat produced by someone he should've passed for DJ Premier. The hook is weak too. The song, based on the concept alone, would've been better without any breaks.\n\nmarcellee.com","classification":3,"fold":7}

That is something that felt better than what the overexposed Beyonce' and Rihanna were able to showcase, due to their \"It Factor!\" I hope Janelle can really craft more surprisingly good songs like this one that get the recognition like Tightrope showed. It really is a great change of pace. We'll see if that happens down the road, and I hope that does.\n\nSong: B+","classification":4,"fold":7}

Bette doesn't play around with this one.  She sings the song in a simple fashion, letting the listener focus on the words and melody.

{"text":"MacArthur Park is the one of the definitive odes to obsessive love, sung by a youngish Richard Harris, of course well-known later as Dumbledore.  This song is the perfect mix of non-singer Harris's enthusiastic delivery, the bizarre lyrics, great melody, and excellent instrumentation.  It was one of my favorite songs from a well misspent California youth.  It is still a great song!  This is the original, over six-minute long version of MacArthur Park - the one that reached No. 2 on the Top 40 - and is the one you remember fondly.

{"text":"Trina's 'Still Da Baddest' may be part of the rap genre but the music on this release isn't as hardcore and 'rap' as one would expect, which I actually think is part of this release's strength. My main criticism that makes this average is that even after a few listens, a lot of the songs blend in together and fail to stand out. The sound, production and lyrics are rather bland and aren't exciting. A positive thing about these songs is that, to me, it's more of a blend of pop and rap than straight forward rapping. Even with the 'explicit' label, there's only one or two songs that are from start to finish explicit as we'd come to expect from Trina. She does manage to dabble with a rap-ballad in 'I Got a Thang For You' and full-blown pop in 'Single Again.' The title track 'Still Da Baddest' is another rather pop-sound with Trina proclaiming and listing reasons why she's at the top of her game. Other stand-out tracks are 'Killing You Hoes' and 'Hot Commodity'.\n\nAs a whole, 'Still Da Baddest' is just average. It's good, but I wish there was more variety and that the songs stood out more from one another. She's at her best when she's trying out new sounds and genres like on songs 'Single Again' and 'I Got A Thang For You' but falls flat when she's intentionally trying to shock the audience with something dirty and explicit, like on 'Look Back at Me'. I also wish she had dug deeper lyrically because on many tracks she's simply rapping about her body and how she's better than others out there; it's good on one song but sounds tired after two or three. A decent release though with some really good tracks and the some that could have been left off due to a lack of creativity and production.","classification":3,"fold":7}

{"text":"Ocie Lee Smith (better known as O.C.) was an R&B singer born in Mansfield, Louisiana and raised in Los Angeles. From a very early age Ocie expressed a keen interest in becoming a singer. His first love was jazz but he also dug the blues. He was greatly influenced by people like Nat King Cole, B.B. King, John Lee Hooker, Tony Bennett, Billy Eckstine and Ray Charles. Ocie sang with a number of big bands including a two and a half year stint with the Count Basie Orchestra in the early 1960's. Then in 1966 he signed a recording contract with Columbia records. His first single in early 1966 was a mellow, slowly swaying and highly memorable song called \"Thats Life\" (by Kelly Gordon  Dean Kay Thompson). \"Thats Life\" made some noise but didn't sell enough copies to hit the national charts (later, in early 67, it bubbled under at # 127). While riding in his car Frank Sinatra, however, heard the song on the radio, arranged a meeting with O.C. and asked for O.C.s blessing to cover the song.  O.C. was flattered, and almost a year later, in late 66, Frank took the song into Billboard Hot 100, where it climbed all the way to #4.\n\nThen in the autumn of 1968 O.C.s cover of Bobby Russells gentle and innocent ballad \"Little Green Apples\" hit the market and became O.C.s biggest hit. It went as high as # 2 on both the pop and R&B charts and became a certified gold record. The record also garnered two Grammy awards as Pop Song of the Year and Country Song of the Year for 1968.  This is the original Columbia hit recording you would remember from the radio.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"If there was an example of a classic band ready to stumble at a crucial hurdle, it would have been Ratt. Wayward lead-singer, dead founding member,  not to mention pretty much being inactive for the best part of two decades, you could be forgiven for thinking that things didn't bode well for this comeback. However, if you wrote a wishlist for what Ratt HAD to do to get you to listen to them again, then they definitely fulfill it on 'Infestation': Great production, crunchy riffs, can't-get-it-out-of-your-head catchiness, tasteful shredding, Pearcy's sneer - all present and correct. Thankfully, they now have a  producer ( Elvis Baskette ), who is obviously a fan. He knows the limitations of the Pearcy 'voice', and makes sure it's upfront and unapologetic. You hear Pearcy, and you hear the 'Ratt Sound'. So you get the patented attitude and swagger. Stand out tracks include \"eat me up alive\", \"best of me\",\"a little too much\", and \"lost weekend\" is so utterly brilliant, that it already stands out as a Ratt classic, rubbing shoulders with such bad boys as \"round & round\", \"you're in love\", \"lay it down\" and \"nobody rides for free\". Individually and collectively,the band are in top form .","classification":5,"fold":7}

To hear some of the greatest guitarists of today (Clapton, Page, Beck, etc) say that if it were not for the older blues musicians they would be nowhere today, just says it all. I love this album and have listened to it over and over. If you have an appreciation for the old school classic blues, this is a great piece work to add to your collection.

{"text":"Unlike some Megadeth fans I did enjoy 13 quite a bit.  it reminded me of Youthanasia a lot but witha  modern feel.  I certainly wouldn't have complained if it had been more thrashy though, but the song writing was good.  Super Collider was another story.  After initial positive feelings I grew to really dislike about half the album and it was a bit worrisome where Megadeth was headed.  My concern grew with the changing of the lineup again.\n\nThankfully Dystopia is a return to form for the band and the new members make great contributions to the album.  The album has a good enough sound to it.  It kind of reminds me of a more consistent World Needs a Hero mixed with Endgame.  Oh yes fellow Megadeth fans the metal is back.  The solos are nice.  The band feels rejuvenated and the song writing is pretty solid as well.\n\nMusically this is a solid album.  Everyone plays very well.  Some complain about Dave's vocals but he sounds fine to me.  Sure he doesn't have the voice he use to but he was never a Rob Halford nor  a Bruce Dickinson.  I feel the vocals are done nicely enough.  Dave has a lot of political views in this album, but honestly if you didn't expect him to do that after 30 years then something's wrong with you.  he's been doing that since Peace Sells.\n\nThe Threat Is Real 8\/10 is a solid thrashy opener witha  nice pace to it and great main riff.  This song kicks you in the teetha nd lets you know Megadeth is a metal band again.  The chorus is only ok, but it's good enough given the rest of the song is so awesome.\n\nDystopia 6\/10 is ok.  It's got some nice guitar licks but I wish it was heavier.  The pace is pretty good and most of the melodies are solid.  the chorus is a bit too repetitive.  Still it's not a terrible song.\n\nFatal Illusion 6\/10 is an ok song.  I like the thrashier section in the second half, but it's got some nice moments.  I don't know this one doesn't do a whole lot for me but it's not bad.\n\nDeath From Within 9\/10 is probably my favorite song on the standard edition.  It's up tempo with some nice melodies and riffs.  I really like the pacing.\n\nBullet To The Brain 8\/10 This one has a different feel to it especially in the too short verses but I like it.  The build up to the chorus is easily as catchy as the chorus itself.  This is another Dave is pissed off at some chick song.  It's pretty solid though.\n\nPost American World 7\/10 This one makes me think of Angry Again.  It's got a nice up tempo to it with the mood being anything but up tempo.  The build to the chorus is slower, and the chorus is faster.  Overall this is a decent song.\n\nPoisonous Shadows 7\/10 this one is more mellow but not soft.  There are some points it reminds me of something from Hero maybe Promise but this is a better song.  Even some of the melodies in the chorus remind me of that chorus.  This one is one of the hardest for me to remember.\n\nLook Who's Talking 7\/10 is a bonus track i just put it here on my ipod in the album.  It's kind of slower but still reasonably heavy with a faster catchy chorus.  This one isn't bad though the talking vocals in the verses aren't great.  Still an enjoyable song that I'd like to have had on the standard edition.\n\nLying In State 9\/10 another of my favorites.  I love the pacing frantic and thrashy.  The drums and bass work very well with the guitars.  This song is freakin' amazing.  I love the tone of it.\n\nThe Emperor 8\/10 has the catchiest chorus on the album.  It's got some silly lyrics but it's still a fairly good song.\n\nForeign Policy 5\/10 is some sort of punk cover I assume.  It's got a nice pacing and Dave and the guys do a decent job at it, but I'm just not a big fan of this song.  I've never heard the original but it's just not my thing.  Still it's ok and doesn't require skipping.\n\nLast Dying Wish 6 \/10 this is another bonus track.  It's got more talking vocals in the verses.  I'm personally not a fan of those style vocals for a song.  the chorus is ok, but I can see why this is a bonus track.  Still it's not bad and worth listening to.\n\nMelt The Ice Away 6\/10 is another cover and another bonus track.  This one is ok I guess, but I've only heard it a couple of times and really don't remember it.\n\nMe Hate You 9\/10 This one has a stupid name, but it's a very solid song.  This definitely should have been on the standard edition.  It's up tempo with anger filled lyrics I'd dedicate to Dream theater at the moment, well part of the lyrics anyways.  Its pacing is solid and the chorus is catchy.\n\nOverall this is a really nice Megadeth album.  It's not as good as their classics but it definitely deserves a place in any Megadeth fan's collection.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Although I've always quite liked Mark Knopfler as a guitarist I've never really been a fan of his or Dire Straits but this new solo record is really good with lots of variety - rock, folk, Celtic, blues and lots of Mark's distinctive guitar and equally distinctive voice. The song writing is also really good, the more folky songs like \"Yon Two Crows\" and \"Haul Away\" have definite British references but so do some of the more rocky songs like \"Corned Beef City\" and even the down home country blues \"After the Bean Stalk\" refers to pantomimes! Mark and co-producer Guy Fletcher do a great job in achieving amazing sounds on all the different styles of music on this record, helped by the excellent band featuring amongst others Richard Bennett on guitars, Jim Cox on keyboards and Ian Thomas on drums.\n\nOne real bonus for me is the presence of Kim Wilson's wonderful blues harmonica on so many of the tracks and this is definitely Mark's most bluesy album. He fully demonstrates his skill as a very versatile blues guitarist, both electric and acoustic and with or without slide, and like all the best blues guitarists he can show real emotion through his playing. However, his voice is just as effective and is totally individual (with just a nod to Dylan) and on many of the slower songs like \"Go, Love\" his vocals are heart-breakingly sad.\n\nThis is a very consistent album and with so much variety that it means it is very hard to pick one track as your favourite. On my first few listens the beautiful, gentle \"Miss you blues\" (with its wonderful slide guitar solos) is the track that stands out for me but I suspect that in the longer term it will be the more folky songs that linger, or perhaps my favourite track will continue to rotate...","classification":5,"fold":7}

Well, actually it's still the only song the band has done that is great, still, after 4 years. Sad. But again, the message is great, and amazingly, I have experienced this with many a church, and the majority refuse to let this great message go through their head.\n\nOverall, great song, great and important message.","classification":4,"fold":7}
{"text":"I ignored this release from Joe when it was released last year. After checking the set list for his upcoming tour, 8 out of 22 songs will be coming from this one. So I decided to listen to the whole thing on You Tube rather than just the sound clips, and then bought it on a gift card. It is a winner with no filler. Granted, there is a good bit of reworkings from his previous catalog, but so what? After such a lengthy career as an instrumental guitar player, it is rather difficult to maintain his own unique stamp without rehashing older material. For any new fans of Joe, this one is actually a good place to start. I have been a fan of his since he first released The Extremist, which is a quarter of a century ago. Try and catch him on this upcoming tour.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Turn Up The Radio takes me back to the days where everyone loved their music loud and people were in their own little world. In the mid 80's there were no cell phones, tablets, smart phones, Internet,  ETC.. We were more social, computers didn't dominate our life. We had MTV with music videos, and that awesome sound of rock coming from Ur ghetto blaster\/boom box. This song is classic and I believe no matter what type of music U like or age you will connect with this hit.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"When I had just found out about the heartbreaking death of Whitney Houston, I was deeply heartbroken beyond what words can say. But for me, I went back to her voice and singing her songs in honor of her memory, and her spirit, and the one song that impacted me the hardest when it came out is I Look To You. The song is still beautiful beyond what words can ever say, heart and soul simply from the voice within. When I first heard this song, it was at the time I was, like the rest of the world, mourning the death of Michael Jackson, just a week after his public memorial service, now I am playing this song non-stop in loving memory of our voice, Whitney Houston.

{"text":"It's been a long time since Rob Zombie graced us with a new album, five years to be exact. What has Rob been up to in that time? Well, there's been new music popping up in various places such as his 2003 Best-Of Collection, \"Past, Present & Future,\" as well as soundtracks for \"The Matrix: Reloaded\" and his own \"House Of 1,000 Corpses.\" But most importantly, he brought his passion for the silver screen to life, with the aformentioned \"House Of 1,000 Corpses\" and it's sequel \"The Devil's Rejects.\" Many doubted he would ever return to music ever again, and I was one of them. However, as his stock in the film industry is rising, Zombie returns to the format we all love him for.\n\nIf you were surprised to find Rob Zombie making new music, you will be shocked to hear what it sounds like. As the bizarre title, \"Educated Horses,\" indicates (as it is not in typical Zombie theme), Rob's music has changed. Typical Zombie fare is here in the form of \"American Witch\" and \"Let It All Bleed Out,\" and believe me, you will love these songs instantly. However, the rest of the album is a bit more challenging. Take for example the first single, \"Foxy Foxy,\" which reeks of 70's funk. This ain't your typical single from Rob, as it's in a totally different realm than songs like \"Dragula\" and \"Living Dead Girl.\" For this album, Zombie enlisted a new backing band, and that could account for the change in musical direction. Fresh from his Zombie-esque side project, Scum Of The Earth, bassist Blasko has returned to the fold, along with the acquisition of ex-Marilyn Manson guitarist John 5 (who has another band by the name of Loser) and Tommy Clufetos, who has spent time playing for Alice Cooper and Ted Nugent, with Zombie veterans Josh Freese and Tommy Lee helping to pad out the drum duties. This dynamic obviously refreshes Rob's sound. I'll admit, as much as I liked it, 2001's \"Sinister Urge\" felt a bit tired. It pales in comparison to Zombie's previous work and I just don't find myself listening to it today as much as I do the other albums. \"Educated Horses,\" however, feels like a different story. Two of my favorite songs are songs that I totally didn't expect Rob to pull out. First, the acoustic (yes, you heard right) \"Death Of It All\" shows that there's more dimension to his music than Rob was willing to show in his past, while the bluesy \"The Devil's Rejects\" is a perfect companion to the movie. The album as a whole is a short listen, but Zombie gets a lot accomplished in a short amount of time.\n\nYou can draw comparisons between Zombie's studio efforts and his directing efforts. \"House Of 1,000 Corpses\" was everything Rob had been building up to, and stylistically went with the theme that he had been going on with both White Zombie and his solo music. \"The Devil's Rejects\" threw everyone through a loop, and showed he was capable of more than is expected of him. Just like the movie was a more mature and fully realized work, so is \"Educated Horses.\" With this album, I don't feel like I've heard it all before, which is not something I can say I've said about Rob in the past. It takes a bit more effort to appreciate, but it's a simply brilliant album. This is 2006, and let's face it, if Rob was pulling the same old tricks, people would be complaining to no end. \"Educated Horses\" is the natural progression, and if you can handle something a little more mature, then surely you can appreciate this.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"One of the coolest things about being one of the best and most original, seminal, untrendy, and influential things to happen to the world of heavy music is having the right to play it safe. And having a free pass to make the same album again and again? That's okay, too. Nobody illustrates this point better than Motorhead. Ever since the date of their inception way back in 1977, this band's sound (which is first and foremost rooted in fast and heavy metal - including thrash, speed, groove, and traditional metal -- yet is also poised with enough restraint and memorable melodies to add dynamic and keep things from getting out of control - and is tinged with punk, hard rock, and even some blues and Southern rock elements) has essentially remained the same. Nonetheless, it is a very potent, catchy, hard rocking, strongly grooving, and contagiously fun sound...so, all is forgiven. Plus, all of their releases come with a stamp of guaranteed quality. In other words, for a long time now, Motorhead have had a fairly high level of excellence looming overhead. And they have always met or exceeded that standard by, time-after-time, kicking out one undeniably good record after another. (This has been the case for so long that it has become almost like clockwork.) Hence, this Birmingham-based trio may not try overly hard or do much in the way of converting non-fans, but one would be exceedingly hard-pressed to find a more consistent band, or one with a more epic discography.\n\nAnd even after all these years, full-length release number 500 (okay, okay, 19), 2008's \"Motorizer,\" finds vocalist\/bassist Lemmy Kilmeister, guitarist Phil Campbell, and drummer Mikkey Dee still sticking with their guns (i.e. the tried and true formula that has gotten them this far). And as usual, no time is wasted in getting right into the thick of things, thanks to a vintage ripper (and probably soon-to-be concert staple) like \"Runaround Man.\" It is an excellent opening blast of all the usual good stuff, including: An energetic snare drum intro, corrosive thrash grooves, punk-flavored rhythms, and yet another all around top-notch performance from the frontman (it is filled with lots of terrifically infectious singing and lyrics.) Meanwhile, the guitars blaze and shred throughout, with a dazzling showcase of blistering riffage and a wild solo. However, once \"Runaround Man\" draws to a close, things suddenly settle way down. \"(Teach You How To) Sing The Blues\" has concertedly restrained chugging anchored by thunderous and commanding bass grooves. The tune is also of note because (as if its name weren't a dead give away), it finds Motorhead's non-metal influences shifting to the forefront - as evidenced by its fluid and positively bluesy guitar soloing. Later on, \"One Short Life,\" works similarly, with its tasty guitar crunch and industrial-strength, churning rhythms, opts for a mid-tempo, groove-oriented approach complete with ample tasty guitar crunch, industrial-strength, churning rhythms, and really thick, driving, dirty\/downtuned\/grungy-sounding bass lines.\n\nOn that note, there is only one other slow moment to be found here. Track nine, \"Heroes,\" blurs the line between being a near-balladry and leather-clad hard rock. A bit of blues also enters the fray during a superb bit of nicely clean soloing near the end. But no matter what genre the song falls under, it is easy to like, thanks to Lemmy's classic phlegm-flecked sing-speak vocals intertwined with borderline-clean singing, a funky bass bottom, AC-DC-esque rock `n' roll beat, and the aforementioned solo section. Back on more familiar ground, it is on the fairly thunderous \"When The Jungle Screams\" (which boasts crunchy, deft, machine-gun riffing, bouncy drumming, and a great chorus and wailing solo to boot), \"Buried Alive,\" the rhythmically stomping \"Back On The Chain,\" and \"Heroes\" that Motorhead unabashedly let their fiery, full-blast, mosh-pit-friendly tempos rip. And elsewhere, the aptly titled \"Rock Out\" (which has an excellent, hulking -- if familiar -- bass intro in the same vein as prior classics like, say, \"Ace Of Spades\"), \"Time Is Right,\" and the album-closing \"The Thousand Names Of God\" all play like 100% pure, groovy, hard-rocking (and distinctly old-fashioned) speed punk.\n\nThe bottom line is that \"Motorizer\" never pretends to be groundbreaking, but, to bastardize an old clich, if it ain't broken, why fix it?! This is definitely an impeccably solid and extremely enjoyable affair. But hey, any metalhead worth their salt should have figured-out long ago that it seems physically impossible for Lemmy and the Gang to make anything less!","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"I still remember my first encounter with MM music.  It was in 1998 when I was only five years old.  My oldest brother was showing me the music video for 'The Dope Show'.  I was traumatized by the appearance of The Goddess Bunny toward the end whom my brother had convinced me was 'Bloody Mary'.  Well you can imagine I steered away from MM music as I grew up after that only really knowing and liking their song 'Beautiful People'.  But in 2011 I suddenly had the urge to look into the band after learning that one of my favorite musicians Trent Reznor had worked closely with the band early in their career.  I began reading about the bands history and the true nature of their songs.  I'm glad I suddenly gave this band a chance that year as I listened to each and every album in a weeks time during my time in Miami, a city that Brian Warner had spent some time in before truly forming the band.  I loved his Trilogy albums.  I liked Grotesque.  I only subtly enjoyed his recent albums after that.  'Born Villain'  was a step in the right direction for the band for me.  But it still lacked in my opinion.  I enjoy music of a wide variety from rock to rap to dance to pop.  To put that in perspective, the next album I'm looking forward to in 2015 is from Modest Mouse, a very different genre from MM.  Recently their haven't been many good metal or hard rock albums in the past few years.  It was almost like the genre was dying.  The last somewhat hardcore music album I purchased was NIN 2013 album.  Then in 2014 when I heard the single 'Third Day of a Seven Day Binge' I was instantly back on track.  Too many people dismiss Marilyn Manson immediately just based on his appearance and costumes.  But most people have no idea how intricate and powerful his lyrics are and how impressive the bands instrumentations can be.  If someone saw me on the street they wouldn't guess that I listen to this band, but that doesn't matter.  What matters is how solid this album turned out to be.  But I must say I do like Mansons attire in the cover of the album, which I also think is the best album cover of their career.  It's almost Joker--esque.  Though I've said I listened to all of the bands albums, this is honestly my first actual album I've purchased from them, and it was worth it.  Here is my track by track review.\n\n1.  Killing Strangers:  As Brian has stated, this song showcases the blues inspired style right away.  The guitars are rocking throughout with some of that haunting vibe the band is known for.  Great powerful vocals too.  9.5\/10\n2.  Deep Six:  I honestly didn't really like this song at first when it was released.  But like most hit singles, it grew on me like a parasite.  This album version with its slow intro build up was nice and made it a much better song to me.  Great lyrics.  Great industrial track that I hope brings back the popularity of this genre!  9\/10\n3.  Third Day of a Seven Day Binge:  One of the best songs by the band ever.  Definitely the best track from them in over 10 years too in my opinion.  This song is just sexy.  Mysterious.  Brooding.  The raspy crooning by Warner is just infectious.  The guitar work is perfect.  Like many are saying, this is one of the prime examples on the album of how mature and evolved the band is even without its original members.  10\/10\n4.  The Mephistopheles of Los Angeles:  I like to think I'm intelligent, but I really did have to look up the word in the title.  I'm liking the guitar style of this album already!  Warners vocals are laid back for such a rocking song, but I love it.  9\/10\n5.  Warship My Wreck:  Gotta love the wordplay.  This one starts slow and brooding before suddenly the band somewhat kicks off in this steamrolling way.  Its really nice on the ears.  The vocals are some of the most emotionally powerful I've heard in this band in a long time.  This one reminds me of some of NINs more apocalyptic work musically.  The final minute features some haunting group vocal work that just works well too.  Great midpoint song.  10\/10\n6.  Slave Only Dreams To Be King:  The song begins with a sample of a speech, and ironically the vocal style of this one is almost speech-like.  Another great industrial track meant to be played loud though.  Great pumping song to add to your workout playlist as well.  Deep lyrics that showcase much more than what the title suggests!  9\/10\n7.  The Devil Beneath My Feet:  I read a critic compare this album slightly to the band Interpol in its sound.  This song is the song that makes that comparison almost legit.  I wouldn't mind hearing this dance rocker in a club.  There is a nice electronic area within the song that surprisingly works amazingly well!  Don't be fooled again by the title, this is a deep song with great meaning and some of the best guitar work from MM in a while.  I would choose this as a single.  10\/10\n8.  Birds of Hell Awaiting:  Aside from MMs appearance, it's these titles that make some people think this is a satanic band which is entirely false.  The lyrics will state otherwise.  Even though this has haunting hell-ish howling within the song, the song is still good.  The bass is nice similar just a bit to that of The Dope Show.  The guitar riff is very bluesy and nice.  Not my favorite, but it could grow on me more.  8.5\/10\n9.  Cupid Carries A Gun:  Infectious and creepy good.  There is even more of that raspy crooning very similar to Third Day Binge.  There is even a nice bell toll throughout.  This song just works all around.  One of the best on the album and will surely be another great single.  Also another great workout playlist addition!  9.5\/10\n10.  Odds of Even:  A slow burner closer and its great as expected.  Just masterful guitar work throughout.  Things almost reach orchestral quality toward the end.  Epic end to this unexpected classic.  9\/10\n\nAs everyone is saying, this is much more mature than you'd expect from this band.  Each song works as a piece to a puzzle.  This album would be incomplete if any instance of the record was gone.  I know I've praised the vocals and guitars throughout, but I almost forgot to mention the great overall production from Tyler Bates which gave the album an almost cinematic feel.  Tyler Bates is a very up and coming name in the film industry with his most popular film score being of Guardians of the Galaxy, the score, not the old school soundtrack.  He is also responsible for the great bluesy guitar riffs throughout.  Hopefully Bates is here to stay with the band in the long run.  It's rare that a band that peaked in the 90s would put out such a masterpiece nearly 20 years later when most bands would be long forgotten.  I would compare this comeback to the recent comeback David Bowie had in 2013.  Many years from now, this will be one of the albums that people will remember this band for.  Now this album will be divided with negative to positive reviews.  There will be the people who are stuck in the 90s and haven't matured through the years as Warner has.  People who haven't grown up to put it more bluntly.  They will probably trash this softer more old school rock sound.  Then there will be the people who did grow up and will appreciate the new mature nature of this middle aged Warner.  Then there will be the people who have no idea about MM from the 90s and will discover a new favorite in this album.  I can see people who didn't like MM like this album.  This is a good album to start with whether you listen to his other work or just enjoy this album as a standalone.  For fans of good music.  But I will say that this isn't an easy listen even though it is very melodic.  I recognize how great it is, but at the same time it isn't the type of album you can binge listen to on repeat for hours.  This is a good but exhausting experience.  Listen at your own precaution, but enjoy.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"There is so much that can be said about Don Henley, and the legacy he has shown in the music industry. Yet, it is a quiet and simple approach to his own music. He had a simplistic plan to take time to make music, but by being patient in regards to his heart. It has been over 15 years since he had simply came out with new music in regards to his own heart with Inside Job, and about 8 years since he had came out with music with The Eagles on the Long Road Out Of Eden. His latest song definitely shows that even after all this time, he has definitely been worth it as a remarkable singer\/songwriter. Don's latest single, Take A Picture Of This, the lead single off of his long-awaited album Cass County is sincerely classic Henley, nothing more and simply nothing less. He has definitely delivered with his sincerest heart, and shown that even after all this time, Don has not changed one single bit from his voice to his humanity in song.

{"text":"Nobody talks to themselves quite like Nicki Minaj, man... and I LOVE the laid-back, COMPLETELY chilled vibe here, for the chorii. Nicki begins MOMENT with the voice of somebody who is absolutely ON FIRE, delivering a manifesto, and then she simply relaxes, as if, when discussing magic(al) moments in life, there is simply no need to even TRY to make the (obvious) point. It feels exactly right, too: when everything is clicking on all cylinders (in life), you simply don't feel any need to force the issue -- or even argue it: you KNOW it's all on-track; you KNOW you're on the correct road. Her arrangement of the song here feels truly right, absolutely sincere -- and that's why it's so powerful -- the laid-back chorus after the insistent, raging, rampaging intro is brilliant... the crit against this track by practically everybody out there in pundit-ville badly misses the point. I've said this before, and I'll say it again: Nicki is the single best Female rapper in the business -- the genre of rap was MADE for this girl to come along... and now, she's here, showing everybody how it's DONE.\n\n\"I fly with the stars in the skies,\" Nicki begins, and then: \"I am no longer trying to survive, I believe that life is a prize... but to live doesn't mean you're alive.\"\n\nPreach it, Nicki.\n\n\"Don't worry bout me, and who I fire\nI get what I desire, it's my empire\nAnd yes I call the shots, I am the umpire\nI sprinkle holy water, upon the vampire (vampire)\nIn this very moment I'm king,\nIn this very moment I slay, Goliath with a sling,\nThis very moment I bring\nPut it on everything, that I will retire with the ring,\nAnd I will retire with the crown, Yes!\nNo I'm not lucky I'm blessed, Yes!\nClap for the heavyweight champ, Me!\"\n\n...you get the idea.\n\nMOMENT is a brazen, bold, triumphant song -- and that the hook here is delivered with a completely relaxed aire is PERFECT. It's NOT a flaw; it's INGENIOUS. It's a demonstration of sheer MUSICAL SENSE. Nicki knows exactly what she is doing -- and the critics are TOTALLY and COMPLETELY wrong in their slamming of this one: they just don't get it.\n\nI do get it, and I like Nicki just fine.\n\n4 stars.\n\n(Drake wrecked it for me, but still, Nicki shines as always.)\n\n\"This is my moment...\nI waited all my life...\nI can tell its time...\n...drifting away...\nI'm one with the sunsets...\nI have become alive.\"\n\nDamn, Nicki.\n\nWhat took you so long...?\n\nThis is what rap SHOULD be: intelligent, thought-provoking... it should feature something worth saying said by somebody worth saying it -- and saying it CORRECTLY -- and by that I mean with voice matching music, and with vocal tone matching content. (Rap, in fact, is a relatively new musical genre, and since it is so young we're haven't yet seen the real FULL development of it yet, as a style. Nicki is leading the charge, though. Mark my words, here: fifty years from now, when rap has gone through the period of development that American jazz went through after it's foundings, we'll be looking back on artists like Nicki Minaj as the people who took a musical style that was still in raw infancy, and showed what kind of potential was really buried deep within it.)\n\nDon't stop making music, Nicki.\n\nYou're here on Earth to do THIS.\n\nDon't let ANYBODY tell you any different.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Nic Pizzolatto created such a sensationally successful series with HBOs TRUE DETECTIVE last season that we all wondered if he could come up with an equal for the second season. The answer is a resounding yes. This series takes place in a make-believe town of Vinci in Los Angeles (very close to the image of the town of Vernon) and is an anthology series in which police investigations unearth the personal and professional secrets of those involved, both within and outside the law. The players include Colin Farrell, Rachel McAdams, Vince Vaughn, Taylor Kitsch, Kelly Riley, David Morse, Lolita Davidovich, Abigail Spencer and a host of others.\n\nThe tie in to this show is the often focused background guitar playing of Lera Lynn whose contributions could not be more impressive. Especially this song My Least Favorite Life. It rings as true as the stunningly intelligent dialogue. A fine script, suberb cast and direction, and the gift of Lera Lynn. Super!

On this CD you get the original 9-track line-up plus one demo version of THE HEART OF ROCK 'N ROLL and live versions of four other tracks. In addition to THORNR,hits from this original late 1983 or early '84 release include HEART AND SOUL,BAD IS BAD,I WANT A NEW DRUG,WALKING ON A THIN LINE and IF THIS IS IT. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic recycled the music of IWAND for his parody entitled I WANT A NEW DUCK for his '85 album DARE TO BE STUPID. Ray Parker Jr. sued Lewis because Parker believed Lewis used pieces of music from Parker's song GHOSTBUSTERS for IWAND. Parker and Lewis agreed to not let their settlement leak at all. Later,Parker inadvertently broke the promise and Lewis sued Parker! The rest is history. HL&TN's frequent hit-making continued with 1986's FORE! which won a multitude of Grammys as well. By the time SMALL WORLD was released in 1988,that album failed to garner any Grammys like its last two predecessors did.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"The water was cool, if a bit murky. The lake was the color of tea, owing to its past as a logging route. Great banks of long tree trunks would bob and sink, staining the lake. At least, that's what the boy's grandpa said. He dove off the dock, slipping into the cool water as easy as an otter, his sunburned skin drinking in the cooling water.\n\nThe lake was very deep, and quickly he was over the vast, deep edges, paddling softly with the easy grace attainable only by the happy few who know the width and depth of summer break. He turned over to his back, the murky, tea-colored haze buoying him up on billows of cool water. He flicked his hands with a careless annoyance as he skirted a patch of loosed seaweed, sending it bobbing away. He watched the clouds, listening to the empty hum of the lake in his ears.\n\nHe slowly noticed more patches floating about him, and bobbed to vertical, wincing as his feet kicked and brushed the slippery, brown strands of weed. The strands twitched and clutched with their soggy strength, and he sighed as he started to plot a course out of the muck.\n\nDeep below, the twitching strands stirred the muck they were rooted so deeply in. The mud puffed then bulged, rising softly in a great mound. Then it opened eyes, great sludgy orbs the size of cars. It slowly rose, freeing its gnashing maw, and drifted up to see what its feelers had found.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Don Williams was a singer\/songwriter\/guitarist who was a major star in the world of country music during the 1970's and 1980's.  In fact, between 1974 and 1986 Don would amass an impressive total of 17 #1 hits on Billboard's Top Country Singles chart.  Despite all of his success as a country artist Don Williams could never seem to come up with the crossover hit that most country artists were always looking for.  Then in 1980 he recorded a ballad written by Roger Cook and Sam Hogin.  Don finally had his crossover hit.  \"I Believe In You\" spent an impressive 20 weeks on Billboard's Hit 100 pop charts peaking at #24 in November of that year.  Meanwhile, \"I Believe In You\" would also become Don's eleventh #1 country hit.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.  Good stuff!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Hard to believe this guy is already in the middle of his second decade in music! In his some eighteen years of recording history he's taken us down some very interesting and often innovative roads and,unfortunately some controversial ones as well. When it seemed that he'd gotton lost on his musical path on the releases following his excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Chocolate-Factory\/dp\/B00007E8J1\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Chocolate Factory<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Happy-People-U-Saved-Me\/dp\/B0001VOHH0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Happy People \/ U Saved Me<\/a>,both albums that were able to effectively blend some of the modern musical stylings with the melodic and rhythm textures of 70's and early 80's funk\/R&B\/disco he released this album that shows in every respect that the muse that inspired the creation of those two excellent albums is not only very much still there but still has enough room within it to grow and develop.\n\n  From the cover art to the music this album actually is a fitting tribute not only to \"retro\" styles of R&B,funk and soul but has the advantage of maintaining that flavor throughout,without the addition of hip-hop guest stars and any variation of that \"\"WHOA HO WHOA HO\" chant over a digitized beat\" style of contemporary R&B that has long since become overused even by Kelly himself. The title song,\"Lost In Your Love\",\"Just Can't Get Enough\",\"Radio Message\" and the Chrisette Michelle duet of \"Love Is\" all are heavily indebted to that sound that bought the \"stepping\" revival into play during 2003\/2004 and represents a style that works extremely well for R.Kelly's style of singing,writing and lyricism-which here represents a turn toward elaborately chorded melodies and passionately sung lyrics that showcase a great deal of maturity and outward realization about love and life that the typically lustfull R.Kelly often skims over and\/or ignores. The only time that (sort of) shows up is on the lusty \"Taxi Cab\" which is also the closest thing this album gets to contemporary.\n\n  Another highlite of this album is the light jazz-funk flavor of \"Number One Hit\",which finds Kelly in his classic style comparing a lady to music by Michael Jackson and Sade and (even though not credit) the harmony vocals of the hook sound a lot like Sade in fact. The latter half of the album showcases Kelly putting a spin on the 60's Motown\/Vee-Jay style of soul balladeering (with the JB influenced mixed in) on \"When A Woman Loves\",\"Music Must Be A Lady\" and \"How Do I Tell Her\". Even though this style of R&B would've seemed retro even in the 70's they showcase a very decent and human outlook on romance that speaks to Kelly's more mature state of mind at this time and aware as I am of the duel sides of his romantic\/sexual outlook I can only hope that this is more an outlook on the future than yet another sidebar. The album ends with his own version of \"You Are Not Alone\",a song so linked with Michael Jackson that people tend to forget R.Kelly wrote it.\n\n  So all and all,considering the high level of musical and production quality that went into it this album might be looked at as a runner up for R.Kelly's most impressive overall album. Now fans of his more sexually aggressive hip-hop\/R&B style of music will not find exactly what they're looking for on this album. But this album actually eludes lyrically to the fact that what constitutes for radio airplay has grown steadily more shallow over the years which,of course leads to a certain amount of self commentary in this case. One can only hope that the twin sides of R.Kelly's nature have reconcilled themselves to the point where him producing music of this quality can become the rule as opposed to the exception but we will just have to see what happens when his next album comes out.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Honestly, when it has came down to it, she has been more of a product than a actual diva at the heart. Somberly, the ballads she has had has been nearly 100% corny, rather than striking the nail on the head. at the voice. Unfortunately, the ballads she has came out with have been poor, but one in a few have been good, but not going as strong from the soul. So when it came down to her pulling a surprise record out for her fans, most of the songs have been more like a waste of time than really worth the effort. XO is one of those songs that really doesn't ignite as a ballad. She really didn't strike the way she tried to do when she covered Etta James' classic standard, At Last. The song really was not strong for her as a ballad, rather than weak from the soul. I think Beyonce' Knowles shouldn't pull rabbits out of her hat, that would not multiply from the heart, rather than leaving raw carrots to the side.\n\nSong: D","classification":2,"fold":7}

'Real Love' 'Song for the Lonely' and 'When the money's gone' are the best of the best. High energy, fun, and radio-ready cuts to say the least. Cher has changed with the times, that is why she had such a long-standing career. Sometimes the computer effects on the tracks get to be a bit much, but I love every song nontheless. Be sure to listen to this disc from start to finish. I can honestly say that there is not one track that could be considered the 'worst' song on the album.

{"text":"Miss You features a lush palette of twin guitars on a disco canvas. Just listen to that four on the floor drum beat, the offbeat bass strut. It is the foundation for the guitar exchanges between Keith and Ronnie. It seems like the guitars are playing something cool every second. Notice in particular these moments: 0:17, 0:26, 0:42-0:45, that little squeak at 1:10, and on and on...it's like finding musical pokemons. You just have to listen. Small\/Faces Ian McLagan on electric piano and the great Sugar Blue on harmonica. Great riff.\n\nThen there's Mick delivering a classic vocal, in particular on the spoken sections that serve to demonstrate how much Mick really misses, well, You, right? Not even his friends can entice him with Puerto Rican girls and cases of wine. He ends up stumbling around Central Park at night like some kind of crazy Aqualung figure, people think he's craaaazy.","classification":5,"fold":7}

Unfortunately, Rihanna has been one of those artists that has been for the past several years, been more like a manufactured product. Sadly, the quality of her songs, just like herself has slowly withered away, to where she has no rhythm in the songs she has came out with. With all the hoopla she has with her upcoming album R8, she really hasn't yet found her real voice in her own work. Also, with the songs that she has done Four Five Seconds with Paul McCartney and Kanye West and American Oxygen, she honestly needs to have better. Bitch Better Have My Money, from the upcoming R8 record is so terrible, she sounded like she took one too many doses of medication, and lost her own voice. I really found this song to make my ears bleed. If Rihanna really wants to impress her fans, maybe she should retire and go back to what makes a real songstress swoon, because she  has became more like a broken record.\n\nSong: F","classification":1,"fold":7}

{"text":"1969 is an EXCELLENT set of covers by Los Lonely Boys. The group sounds as good as they ever did; and the arrangements and the mixing couldn't be any better on this EP. Every one of these five tunes is a classic and Los Lonely Boys put their own stamp on all five of them using a few key and tempo changes here and there plus some mighty special vocals; and it all works very well. I love it!\n\nThe EP album opens with Los Lonely Boys doing a great job on Santana's \"Evil Ways.\" The guitars are awesome and these guys make this tune electric with a rendition that ups the tempo just a little that amazingly adds quite a bit of extra energy to this tune. The Garza brothers really do this one up right--hey, is that Santana I see getting jealous?\n\n\"Well Alright,\" a number written by Buddy Holly, Norman Petty, Jerry Allison and Joe B. Maudlin, gets the royal treatment from Los Lonely Boys--and wow, what a great effect this has! There's a noticeable Latin flavor added to some awesome rockin' music with those guitars and drums especially. Now THIS is great music! There's also a fantastic cover of The Beatles' \"She Came In Through The Bathroom Window;\" Los Lonely Boys yet again score a huge goal by taking this and mixing it up just a bit with a Latin flavor--and they play with the tempo and keys just enough to keep it quite strong in their own way. The Beatles would have approved!\n\n\"Polk Salad Annie\" rocks as Los Lonely Boys perform this tune originally written and recorded by Tony Joe White and later re-recorded by the great Elvis Presley. \"Polk Salad Annie\" leaves little to be desired as Los Lonely Boys do this to perfection! Their sense of timing and that really cool arrangement make this a winning number yet again. The EP ends very well with Los Lonely Boys doing \"Roadhouse Blues;\" this is an electric number that rocks--it also makes me cry out for MORE!\n\nLos Lonely Boys turned out an excellent EP with 1969. Andy Johns also did his usual outstanding job when he mixed these tracks. I highly recommend this for fans of this group; and it's so good that even if you're not a fan already you may want to consider picking this one up or downloading it soon.","classification":5,"fold":7}

But, as they say, better late than never, and fans of good old southern soul will eat this one up!\n\nBell has astutely chosen some very talented people to co-write the songs with him for this album, luminaries such as Rosanne Cash, Marc Cohn, and John Leventhal (Rosanne's husband). He also covers a Jesse Winchester song, \"All Your Stories,\" that sounds like it was made to order for him. From the striking opening track, \"The Three of Me\" to the poignant closer, \"People Want To Go Home,\" this album is polished and smooth, but also powerful and gritty when it needs to be.

{"text":"Keystone Companions\/The Complete 1973 Fantasy Recordings, recorded live on July 10 and 11, 1973 at the Keystone club in Berkeley, California, beautifully captures the magical musical friendship of keyboardist Merl Saunders and guitarist Jerry Garcia.\n\nThe band featured Saunders on keyboards; Garcia, guitar and vocals; John Kahn, bass; and Bill Vitt, drums. Virtuoso David Grisman added mandolin to Bob Dylan's \"Positively 4th Street.\" The mix of songs ranged from Saunders originals to covers of songs by Jimmy Cliff, Junior Parker, Holland-Dozier-Holland, Rodgers & Hart, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup, Lightnin' Hopkins, Don Nix and Dan Penn and Dylan.\n\nThis four CD set documents this long lived musical friendship commencing back in 1970 when Saunders replaced Howard Wales at a weekly jam session at the Matrix in San Francisco. The two musicians learned from each other and over time grew a musical relationship that would last up to the time of Garcia's passing in 1995. Live at The Keystone was recorded in 1973 while The Dead were touring heavily.\n\nIn all the years of friendship and collaboration between the two, Merl only played with The Dead three times. I read, \"Saunders told Garcia biographer Robert Greenfield that the Grateful Dead seemed somewhat threatened by the pair's musical alliance.\n\n\"This music is as exciting and satisfying 40 years later as it was on the day it was made.\"\n\n\"This deluxe four-disc package contains remastered versions of all the material from both those concerts presented in original running order. In restores the three-and-a-half-minute jam \"Space\" with the full, nearly 14-minute version, now entitled \"Merl's Tune.\" In addition, there are six more previously unreleased selections. All are different takes of songs that were featured on the earlier sets, including \"The Harder They Come,\" \"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry,\" \"My Funny Valentine,\" \"Merl's Tune,\" \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You),\" and \"Someday Baby.\"\n\nThey had a chemistry that you can hear and feel. The most important thing is the music. It's live and it's experimental, so sometimes the quality is not the best but much of this set is brilliant because of the spontaneous interplay between the two.\n\n\"If you're a Deadhead, you already know how great these shows were, and you probably have some of the earlier releases. You should still get this, for the extra hour of unreleased material and the better sound. If you're not a Deadhead, listen to some of the samples on Amazon; this music is very different from that of the Grateful Dead. If you don't like the Dead, you may find Jerry's solo work to be wonderful. This is a testament of a great guitarist playing the music he liked when he wanted to relax, at his peak, with a fine backing band.\"\n\n\"The band, in a bid to avoid the kind of attention that followed Garcia in his main job as guitarist in the Grateful Dead, didn't even have a name. It quickly becomes clear that the music was so good, the atmosphere so loose and the times so memorable in and of themselves that, well, they simply didn't need one.\"\n\nThis is smooth laid back 70's progressive jazz rock that everyone should appreciate. This is a fantastic package.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"I know, I bought a Train album, I still can't believe it myself and I'm still not sure my reasons are sound but here goes. This isn't old school \"Drops of Jupiter\" Train, this is new school let's get POP Train. The sound of the band has changed over the years much in the same way Maroon 5's have, it's gotten more upbeat and radio friendly, though Patrick Monahan's voice isn't nearly as whiny as Adam Levine's has become. Changing with the times I guess to stay relevant. Alas, after listening to bits I found I kind of liked the hand-clappiness of it. Strange it was released in the fall as it has more of a happy summer vibe to it instead. Songs are catchy (a formula that got them a couple hits on their last set) and I do like the duet with Marsha Ambrosius. Overall I think it is a solid pop record that deserves a listen from any Top 40 aficionado, something I do consider myself at times and not in an ironic or disrespectful way. Sometimes it is good to just put on something upbeat to dance and clap the day away.","classification":4,"fold":7}
{"text":"Mastodon has evolved. Again. Gone are the sludge metal\/prog metal days of Remission and Leviathan. They are a hard rock band now so get over it! While some fans may not like the stylistic change of this album and The Hunter, one thing remains clear- at any given time, whatever genre Mastodon has been playing, they play it well. Unlike their prior records which shifted significantly from the previous release, OMRTS is quite similar to The Hunter, but better executed. Yes there are intros on many of these songs that are reminiscent of Leviathan\/Blood Mountain era riffs, and yes the drumming of Brann Dailor is still frenetic and unpredictable. However the verses and choruses are definitely more \"hard rock\" sounding than anything recorded before The Hunter. Clean vocals are nothing new for Mastodon (remember \"Seabeast\"?), but catchy, sing along choruses are what I think many long time fans are having trouble with. Fortunately, many of these choruses work very well (\"Motherload\", \"High Road\" and title track), while others are a bit cheesy (\"Ember City\"), or just a total mess (\"Asleep in the Deep\"). There are a few great tracks here - \"Halloween\", \"Aunt Lisa\", and the title track being my favorites. \"Aunt Lisa\" in particular stands out for the great opening riff, awesome drumming and unexpected changes of pace that make it the most interesting song on the album. It's crazy and weird, apparently just like Brann's real Aunt Lisa. I have the feeling that every song on the album will be someone's favorite- there's quite a bit of variety so different tastes will find something to latch onto. In summary this is a solid, satisfying record which has improved upon the formula laid out on The Hunter. Mastodon will continue to gradually change over time and I think this album shows the general direction in which they are heading.\nAnd I don't mean to sound like an old man , but for God's sake, buy the damn CD or vinyl - don't download it - the artwork itself is worth the price, and take out those damn earbuds and listen to this on some loud big-ass speakers or a good car stereo system","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Once upon a time there was a director who, along with some friends - a writer, a cameraman, some actors - made a movie. It doesn't matter what the movie was about. It could have been about aliens, or cowboys and indians, or a young couple suffering through a rocky relationship, or a bank robbery gone wrong. Whatever it was about, the director wanted to make the best movie he could make, and for the audience who saw that movie to care about the characters, and to empathize with the emotions they felt. At some point, he approached a composer, in order to give that film a musical voice. The composer - who was well-versed in musical theory and composition - was as much of a storyteller as the director was, and wanted to enhance the film with his music; to bring out subtle emotions so the audience could feel them, to highlight subtexts that acting alone could not convey, to make it a better film than it would be without the music being there.\n\nThe director and composer decided what sort of music was needed, and how much, and then the composer went away and wrote: he wrote music which was specific to that film, tailored to those scenes, and those characters. His score gave the film an identity, with an overarching structure, recurring thematic ideas and musical reference points that drew characters, concepts and locations together, so that they felt like a part of the fully realized world the movie inhabited. He poured all his knowledge and craft into the score, making it interesting and compelling from a musical point of view, while simultaneously serving the drama on-screen. He made the action more exciting. The made the horror scarier. He made the relationships more romantic. He made the tension so tense you would bite your fingernails to the quick. Of course, the composer would have a musical style of his own, and once in a while a certain way of phrasing an instrument, or the way a chord progressed, would relate back to something else that same composer wrote before, but that's inevitable when a composer writes as much personal music as a film composer does, and would not detract much from the new work. The composer then recorded that score, using the finest musicians he could find, bringing all that talent and experience to bear on the music. The resulting work was a perfect marriage of pictures and sound, with music that was memorable, musically compelling, interesting and complex, dramatically appropriate, emotionally powerful, and crafted solely to serve that film and no other. This approach was so successful that everyone decided that this should henceforth be the way films should be scored, and everyone lived happily ever after. The end.\n\nExcept that it's not the end, because brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo decided that, when it came to their film Captain America: The Winter Soldier, they would ignore all of that and ask composer Henry Jackman to write one of the most grating, themeless, emotionally barren scores I have had the misfortune of hearing in several years. The words \"clichd\" and \"generic\" could have been invented specifically for this score, which takes all the worst aspects of modern film scoring and amplifies them a hundred fold, reveling in their lack of coherent musical ideas, individual identities, and musical inventiveness. In these circumstances I would usually break out my `polar bear with a migraine' photo and leave it to speak for itself, but my friend and colleague James Southall's excellent review of this score made me want to make some points of my own.\n\nThe film itself is apparently very good; more of a political thriller than a super-hero movie, it picks up Captain America's story two years after the events of The Avengers. Now living in Washington DC and struggling to adjust to life in the 21st century, the Captain himself Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) finds himself thrust back into action when a SHIELD operative is attacked by a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier, whose exploits date back to the cold war. Teaming up with fellow super-heroes Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Captain America must uncover the mystery surrounding the Winter Soldier's identity, and stop the threat he poses to the world. The film has a fantastic supporting cast, including Robert Redford, Sebastian Stan, Frank Grillo, Emily Van Camp, and Marvel Universe regulars Samuel L. Jackson, Colbie Smulders and Dominic Cooper, and looks set to be one of 2014's most successful films.\n\nIn musical terms, however, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an absolute disaster. The Marvel Universe films have always been a bit hit or miss when it comes to their scores, with little to no musical continuity between them, and a revolving roster of composers ranging from Ramin Djawadi to Patrick Doyle to Brian Tyler. Alan Silvestri's score for the first Captain America film was excellent, filled with all the things I talk about in my opening paragraphs, and - best of all - containing a rousing, memorable theme for Captain America himself. Sadly, Winter Soldier's composer Henry Jackman ignores everything Silvestri did, instead composing a more `modern' score which emphasizes sound design and electronic textures over anything resembling actual music. I hate writing paragraphs like this, because historically I have liked Henry Jackman's work a great deal. It's astonishing to me that a composer who can craft such wonderful scores as Gulliver's Travels, Puss in Boots or Wreck-It Ralph could turn around and write something as obnoxious as this.\n\nThere is a new theme for Captain America - a bit of martial heroism for brass and snare drums introduced in \"Project Insight\" - although why Jackman decided not to use Silvestri's established theme for the character is beyond me, especially when Brian Tyler even quoted it in Thor 2. There's a bit of warm Americana which appears in the brief \"The Smithsonian\". And that's about it, in terms of positive things I can say about this score. Probably the worst aspect of Jackman's score is that, for the most part, it's not even made up of his own ideas. For example the opening track, \"Lemurian Star\", is little more than a combination of Hans Zimmer's now-ubiquitous extended brass note from Inception, John Powell's synthy action rhythms from the Bourne series. Similarly, the big action set pieces which come later - \"Taking a Stand\", \"Into the Fray\" and \"Countdown: for example - have moments of power and grandeur, but have no real individual identity. Despite a couple of them containing repeat performances of the new Captain America theme from \"Project Insight\", nothing about them ever really says `this is music for Captain America'. Jackman's theme is so nondescript, it could be from any superhero or action movie from the past 20 years, and the action rhythms and percussive patterns Jackman employs sound like all the other action rhythms and percussive patterns everyone from Hans Zimmer down has used for the past decade.\n\nAt the other end of the scale cues like \"An Old Friend\", \"Alexander Pierce\", \"Frozen in Time\" and \"Natasha\" are quieter but say nothing; they just meander along for a couple of minutes, presenting muted orchestral textures, string sustains, serious timpani rumbles. Unobtrusive, understated, but completely inert in terms of anything resembling musical development.\n\nWorst of all are cues like \"Fury\", the truly awful \"The Winter Soldier\", \"Fallen\", \"Hydra\" and \"The Causeway\", which are simply appalling: little more than exercises in repeated string rhythms and loops overlaid by various banging and clanging industrial sound effects, and groaning electronic textures. Both \"The Winter Soldier\" and \"The Causeway\" contain what sounds like a processed scream as part of the electronic sound mix, and which appears to be an attempt at a leitmotif for the Winter Soldier character himself; when I first heard it I had to stop and check that it wasn't my own screams I could hear over my headphones.\n\nI have been around the film music industry for a long time now - almost 20 years. I have attended scoring sessions, and attended lectures and seminars on the art. I have met pretty much every major composer working in Hollywood today, and I consider many of them friends. I understand fully that the demands put upon a film composer's shoulders are enormous, ranging from ever-decreasing budgets and ever-decreasing timescales to having to deal with temp tracks, focus groups, musically illiterate directors, and boardrooms full of producers who all want to have their say about how the music should sound. Long gone are the days where one director and one composer would work together to craft their musical vision of a film, as in my rose-tinted once-upon-a-time story that opened this review. Truthfully, I'm not sure my idyllic fairytale of the film score world was ever what it was truly like. In many ways, you can't blame Henry Jackman for giving his employers exactly what they wanted: that's his job, after all. But, still, there has to be a way to write a score which fulfills all the demands set by the no-nothing money men, but doesn't strip away all the emotion, doesn't pander to the common denominator, and still manages to contain some semblance of identity, uniqueness, and inventiveness for both the composer and the film. There has to be a way.","classification":1,"fold":7}

{"text":"First of all, Secondhand Serenade isn't a rock band, it's a solo act (John Vesely) who made his own success the old-fashioned way...playing live and selling his music independently.  John is a perfectionist at what he does and it shows in his work.  \"Fall For You\" isn't just another ballad written to appease a record exec who wanted something to sell.  It looks like one reviewer forgot to do his homework before doing his writing.  What \"Fall For You\" IS?...another shining example of his excellent craftsmanship and ability to express emotions everyone feels through his gift of beautiful music.  On this album, \"A Twist In My Story\", he chose to record with a full band...when he plays live, he mixes things up and uses different musicians to keep things original.\nALL of his songs are intimate, from the heart tunes, simple but effective in sending chills down the spine of the listener.  John has an incredible vocal range with a special unique characteristic in his vocal tone.\n\"Fall For You\" has a great melody, and when you hear it once, it makes you want to hear it over and over again.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Steve Jablonsky has been Michael Bays go-to composer for a long time now, and even before he got that honor he was composing additional music on scores like Hans Zimmers Pearl Harbor and Trevor Rabins Armageddon and Bad Boys II. I really think Steve Jablonsky and Michael Bay make an awesome composer\/director combo, and the Transformers films have given us some great action scoring over the years. To cut straight to the point through, no this still doesnt match the emotional action epicness that the first Transformers score was. But it does do a great job of doing what it needs to do. It lacks a definitive hooking element, but the Age Of Extinction score is solid summer entertainment.\n\nIts actually quite interesting to look at all 4 Transformers scores and see how little they actually share in terms of structure and approach. #1 was all big themes and grand arcs, #2 was a disjointed mess at no fault of Steves, #3 layered the bombast thickly with a sweeping action romanticism, and #4 seems to be the most restrained and grounded in reality of them all. I know saying reality while talking about Transformers seems a little dumb, but the score isn't trying to be sweeping or thematic here. Jablonsky hits hard, and while the score is restrained in approach it still has a sharp edge to it. The comparisons to Man Of Steel are valid, as the Lockdown motif carries a similar structure to Zimmers DNA motif from Man Of Steel. But then again you could say Dark Of The Moon had Inception elements and that the first Transformers had Black Hawk Down\/Batman Begins elements. Hans has actually been involved a little bit in these scores (technically, not creatively) since Steve and him are good buds. So there will always be style similarities any way you look at it. The score is still a Steve Jablonsky score. I could pick out moments that reminded me of his other non Transformers scores such as The Island and Pain & Gain, which was great. The one aspect of the score I thought didn't really work was incorporating Imagine Dragons. The vocals work up to the point that they turn from tonal layers and into audible lyrics. When you try to blur the line between score and song for a film like this, I think it takes you out of it more than it pulls you in. You start to try and listen to the lyrics and it kind of ruins the moment. It starts to become a music video. In the end though there are some great moments and the whole score has a unified feel. Jablonsky gives the music a serious weight, and it adds plenty of dramatic heft to the film. The textures and action builds are all great and work in this more restrained form.\n\nI would say Age Of Extinction boasts some of the best structure and approach since the first Transformers. The only difference is that the score played over the action in the first Transformers, while it plays under the action here. I prefer the former over the latter, but I still enjoyed the score and experience. There are plenty of moments worth revisiting as the score is indeed a memorable blockbuster effort. It can be seemingly average at times, but there are some great standout moments.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"The 1980 classic debut album by Zapp, with production by Roger Troutman and Bootsy Collins (of P-Funk fame)is a one-way trip to funkville.  The 9 minute classic \"More Bounce To The Ounce\" introduces the world to Roger's trademark talkbox over a deep-groove lowrider ready beat.  If you live in So. Cali, you'll hear this jam blaring out of Impalas' sound systems sittin on D's.  The song does not have many lyrics except for a hook and some phrases here and there, a trademark of many of Zapp's jams.  Those type songs are reserved for groovin' on the dancefloor, and are perfect as they are.  I love the uptempo twangy, guitar-ridden groove.  It is easy to hear a P-Funk influence here.  There is an element of soul in the jam \"Be Alright.\"  It has a slightly softer vibe and has nice harmony and is cool for chilin' with ya boo.  Of course, this song regained infamy as it was sampled in 2Pac's classic hip-hop joint \"Keep Ya Head Up\" from 1993.  \"Brand New Player\" is a cool, twangy swingin' joint about a cat who is cool and has mad mack for the ladies.  I love the jazzy hook with the ladies harmonizing.  More talkbox madness abounds on \"Funky Bounce,\" a self-explanatory jam which is tailormade for the disco clubs of the early 80's.  \"Coming Home\" is a faster-paced harmonica laden jam that is for getting with the ladies.  Zapp ruled the 80's with their deep-groove funk and dance floor ready numbers, and that all started here with this bangin' debut.  Fans of P-Funk should definitely check for this one provided such fans have not already had this in their collections for decades.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Yes is one of those bands that I love no matter which lineup is currently working.  That being said, I jumped aboard the YesWorld bandwagon with the album \"Drama.\"  I didn't know that much about them then, so didn't care who was \"supposed\" to be singing or playing keyboards.  Therefore, I judged that album at face value and believed it to be one of best prog-rock albums of all time.  I believe that still.\n\nNeedless to say, I was very excited to hear that \"Fly From Here\" boasts the same basic lineup as on \"Drama,\" with the exception of Horn singing...sort of...Trevor Horn adds backing vocals, which makes the sound complete to my ears.  \"Fly From Here\" is not nearly as dramatic (for lack of a better word) as \"Drama\" but the sound is there and it is still very magical.  To me, it is the \"middle-aged\" version of \"Drama\" so it makes sense to me that it is more mellow than it's predecessor.\n\nBottom line?  The songs on \"Fly From Here\" are beautiful.  In fact, I believe this to be the most listenable Yes album in their catalog.  (Check out \"Hour Of Need\"!!!)\n\nAnd the icing on the cake is that Chris Squire's bass sound still kicks butt!","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Ah, the Supreme Warbler!  She is to popular music what Florence Foster Jenkins was to classical.  Were they parody?  Or unfortunate victims of a cruel and greedy commercial machine that used them up like oil and spat them out when they were spent?  There were, after all, musical satirists like Anna Russell and much later, The Bonzo Dog Band and Monty Python, who reeked havoc with their sonic exploits, and made pots of money doing it, too.  But they knew exactly what they were doing.  What about Mrs. Miller?\n\nJonathan & Darlene Edwards came along years before Mrs. Miller, but I only discovered them many years after I fell in love with Mrs. Miller.  The former act was, in case some readers don't know it already, a gifted piano player\/bandleader Paul Weston, and a supreme vocal stylist known in popular vocalist circles as a singer's singer, Jo Stafford.  She eventually became Weston's wife.  They were best known as themselves, but forged a separate career in musical parody.  What made me convulse with laughter when I was in the mood to listen to these two cutting up vinyl was the knowledge that bad singing isn't easy, and Jo did it by singing sharp.  Try it.  It's harder than singing flat; believe me (and sounds even more horrible).  Now, you may be asking, what do Jonathan and Darlene Edwards have to do with Mrs. Miller?  For me, it's personal, but it may help me to explain the appeal of Mrs. Miller to so many people.\n\nI tried to introduce a foreign-born coworker in an office where I worked to Jonathan and Darlene.  He would have none of it.  He said, \"she's doing that deliberately; that's not funny.\"  You see I had previously turned him on to the giddy delights of Mrs. Miller.  In prying my friend for answers as to why he found Jonathan and Darlene NOT funny, and Mrs. Miller roll-on-the-floor hysterical, I got an unexpected response.  No, he said Mrs. Miller is like your grandmother singing your favorite popular songs to you, and maybe even some songs you hate.  Somehow, she's innocent, charming, and yes, very, very funny.  Whatever the true story, and you'll read of several in these Amazon reviews, what the person called Mrs. Miller left us was a small body of crystalline comedic treasures.  She may or may not have been exploited, or she may have exploited herself, but she was an otherwise nobody who became immortal.\n\nJust listen to these miracles of concise humor and comic mistiming.  How can you not laugh and love this woman all at the same time?  And face it, who's gonna take \"Sweet Pea,\" \"Catch A Falling Star\" and \"I've Got A Tiger By the Tail\" seriously, anyway?  This music was ripe for a little destructive reinterpreting.  And her \"Boots?\"  Sorry, Nancy, Mrs. Miller's is The Definitive Version.\n\nMy one, small criticism of this nearly complete compilation is the omission of \"Up, Up And Away.\"  Talk about Definitive! (If you're a Mrs. Miller fan already, and haven't heard \"Up, Up and Away,\" you owe it to yourself to hunt down this delightful rarity). But perhaps the best moment on this particular collection is when Mrs. Miller hits that high note in \"Lover's Concerto.\"  She NAILS it!  And people said she couldn't sing!\n\nI think Jonathan and Darlene Edwards had the harder task, both musically, and as comedians, but they could always have the perspective in life that they had a goof, enjoyed it, made some money, and did it with purpose; you can even hear them winking in their recordings.  I do think they are funny, but in a very different way from how Mrs. Miller is funny.  My coworker was right about one thing:  Mrs. Miller was Grandma.  And you might laugh WITH her and even AT her when her back was turned, but never would you sneer at her face to face.  No, you want to give her a hug, because somehow these crazy, one-of-a-kind creations exemplify the best that comedy has to offer.  I completely disagree with those who say that laughing at Mrs. Miller's music is cruel.  I think Mrs. Miller might have understood, had she lived to witness her digital revival, that she had created something entertaining and unique, even if it wasn't taken as she had intended.  Nothing to be ashamed of there, and if her life was in some ways tragic, its legacy is not the least bit sad.","classification":5,"fold":7}

{"text":"Bruno Mars certainly had one of the more anticipated debut albums of 2010.  After superb turns with other artists (\"Nothin' On You\" with B.o. B and \"Billionaire\" with Travie McCoy), Mars struck out on his own with his solo #1 hit, \"Just the Way You Are.\" Mars's debut is not as perfect as the Billy Joel lifted title, but&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Doo-Wops-Hooligans\/dp\/B003ZJ0ZX0\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Doo - Wops & Hooligans<\/a>&nbsp;possesses more than enough solid moments over it short ten tracks at thirty-five minutes total to be both enjoyable and promising for Mars's future.  Hopefully, Doo-Wops & Hooligans strikes more a chord than some recent albums by debut artists, namely the dismal selling, though enjoyable<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/31-Minutes-to-Takeoff\/dp\/B003R4JB56\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">31 Minutes to Takeoff<\/a>&nbsp;by soulful pop singer Mike Posner.  Additionally, let's hope his recent run-in with the law (a felony) does not degrade a promising career.\n\n\"Grenade\" opens the album off a bit oddly, finding Mars contrasting his usually polished, lazy vocals with more overt, forced vocals.  \"Grenade\" sounds the slightest bit clunky at times and does not represent Mars as the crooner that we've (the listeners) have come to know him as.  He has some nice vocal moments, achieving some soulful grit that listeners have also desired to hear, but he overdoes the nuances vocally.  \"Grenade\" does grow on you after a couple of listens, but despite its sound production work, it is eclipsed by much better cuts from 'Doo-Wops & Hooligans.' Think of \"Grenade\" as a bit of `false-start.'\n\n\"Just The Way You Are\" atones for any questions of Mars's credibility that may be raised from the left-field \"Grenade.\" Here the songwriting is much better executed and the production work is simple, yet beautiful and captivating.  \"Just the Way You Are\" is the valedictory cut by all means, accentuated by a schmaltzy, yet sincere refrain: \"when I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change, cause you're amazing, just the way you are...\"  \"Our First Time\" rivals the greatness of \"Just the Way You Are,\" only missing its superbness by a few short notches.  Initially, the reggae-tinged cut may be a bit `off-putting,' but quickly one feels the lazy vibe suits Mars perfectly.  Again, the songwriting is strong with another catchy, though not revolutionary hook (\"just go wit it... and I will go real slow wit it... it's our first time\").  But let's face it, the charm of Mars's vocal makes up for the corniness right?\n\n\"Runaway Baby\" is like \"Grenade\" in the sense that it is a bit awkward.  Mars thrives on lazier cuts as opposed to up-tempo numbers that degrade his vocal polish slightly.  But he once again atones for this with a the enjoyable and lyrically relevant \"Lazy Song\" which finds  Mars referencing the rap song \"Teach Me How To Dougie,\" among other absurdities.  \"Lazy Song\" is enjoyable because of Mars' consummate pop culture references and `stream of consciousness' approach in addition to it brief 3:20 length.\n\n\"Marry You\" is solid, though it sounds similar in conception and sound to \"Just the Way You Are,\" lifting the underlying progression.  Despite this, the production is clever, the drums are big sounding quoting the 1980s, and the corny `wedding bells' are actually a clever addition.  \"Talking to the Moon\" slows the tempo once more, showing off the beauty of Mars's vocals.  The production is solid and while \"Talking to the Moon\" also sounds similar to previous cuts (namely the progression is similar to \"Billionaire\"), Mars pulls it off incredibly well.  It is another nice addition to the track list.\n\n\"Liquor Store Blues,\" featuring Damian Marley is as enjoyable as everything else here.  Again, Mars favors a reggae-tinged approach, but it bodes well for him.  The hook is clever once again: \"one shot for my pain, one drag for my sorrow, get messed up today, I'll be ok tomorrow.\"  Marley is surprisingly tamer than usual here, not stealing Mars's thunder in the least.  \"Count On Me\" finds Mars sounding like a mix between Jason Mraz and Jack Johnson; the cut itself channels recent Plain White T's hit single \"1,2,3,4\".  There is nothing monumental here, but some smart choices are made to omit drums from the production work and add nice, lush strings.  Closing cut \"The Other Side,\" featuring Cee-Lo Green and B.o. B is another standout, and the perfect choice to close this effort.  It is uptempo, but Mars sounds better than previous uptempo cuts, though it may be Cee-Lo Green that steals the show.  B.o. B.'s verse is strong, additionally.\n\nOverall, this is a solid debut album on all accounts.  It is short, but given the fact that Mars' relies on lazy grooves for his best vocal performances, the short length bodes in his favor;  a longer album would have knocked the quality down a notch most likely.  Vocally, there is room for more maturity for Mars, but if given the chance, I think that we as the listeners can expect it on his NEXT album.  Strong debut; 3 1\/2 stars","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"You know... every single damn time I hear anybody take a chance with Euro-trance these days (in a major US single), it always strikes me as MA$$IVE, and it's no different this time: it's BEYOND massive; the song has all all kinds of game. The problem is that Euro-trance simply doesn't move the units here in the states, a thing which has LONG left me scratching my head. I mean, I really just don't get that: trance moves HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of SKU's in Europe, and yet here in the US it basically amounts to a rounding error amidst aggregate sales for the majors.\n\nThis time, however, I think we might actually get a shot at seeing some trance break heavily on the American big chart -- WHERE is an engraved invitation to re-mixers, for starters, plus with 60 million VEVO views at YouTube (in 45 days!) you can't really say it didn't get a push... although it really does sound (to my ears, anyways) as if it were crafted (much) more for the singles charts in Europe. I am genuinely a bit surprised they decided to drop this to American radio (although I am glad that they did).\n\nTell you something: What the people behind the board here have done is to take basic trance breakdowns and \"punk-ify\" them. Listen closely, and tell me you can't hear the punk buried in there. Listen again. That's a punk riff done in trance, my friends (and sterilized for US radio). Oh YES, it absolutely IS. Stop arguing with me, here. Listen again, and listen FOR THE PUNK. Too, the timing & arrangement of R's vox strike me as following the syllabification pattern of Adele's ROLLING IN THE DEEP. YES, again, I'm telling that's EXACTLY why it sounds so familiar at first listen. Stop arguing with me, already -- you KNOW I'm right. It's a by-the-numbers hit done mostly by the book, but with enough different (the punk influence buried within the electronica, in particular) to make it damned interesting.\n\nIt's good work; the whole thought process here is brilliant.\n\nIt's a Euro single made accessible for the US market.\n\nRihanna: more of this, please.","classification":4,"fold":7}

The 'ambient' music (a term I see that is being used quite frequently in reviews for this release) is good music to do yardwork, that is if nothing else is playing! There is not enough of David Gilmour's ethereal guitar sound on this album. He recently did some soundtrack music for a movie called \"Vile People\" that starred Donald Sutherland. It was scored by Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead fame. It was amazing, Gilmour's work was. I absolutely do not like Radiohead but Dave brought that score to life, folks! Where is that playing here?\n\nOh, the poor souls who spent $30 on the deluxe version, I feel for you guys...You  will be payin that dough for packaging, which is basically a box, two postcards, a hologram and a \"hardback book\" that contains track notes and some '94 photos of the group.\n\nThe music is mainly FILLER, which given that is Pink Floyd means GOOD filler, but filler nonetheless. A lack of searing Gilmour Strat is sorely absent. Only one track has vocals and lyrics, which Mr Gilmour sings, in usual appealing tenor. One reviewer stated it perfectly, that this material should have been release as some sort of companion disc for the reissue of \"Division Bell.\" Shoulda woulda coulda! This material is yet another Christmas cash grab. I've actually listened to the album twice, and the main highlight is the only proper song, \"Louder Than Words.\"\n\nFinal Verdict: 4 on a scale of 1 to ten.

{"text":"Jordan Knight has had an interesting career over the last two decades. While he was best known as the frontman of the successful late 80's boy band New Kids On The Block, his career as a solo artist has seen a fraction of that success. In 1999, he released his self-titled debut \"Jordan Knight\" on Interscope Records while staring down the barrel of being 30 years old. The album featured the production talents of legendary hitmakers Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis as well as a then-unknown Robin Thicke, and scored a huge hit with the raunchy first single \"Give It To You\". His album was successful, but didn't go as far as it could have- mostly because Interscope marketed the album as a pop record when it was really a blue eyed soul recording. Knight disappeared from public view for over five years until he returned with a trilogy of albums- a tribute disc on his former group New Kids On The Block, followed by the EP \"The Fix\" and the album consisting almost entirely of covers, 2006's \"Love Songs\". In 2008, he reunited with his group New Kids On The Block for their first album in almost fifteen years \"The Block\". He resumed his solo career in 2011 with his first studio album in five years- his first for the label E1 Music called \"Unfinished\".\n\nOn Knight's new album, he delves into the electro and Euro-dance music that has been popular over the last few years. He drives the point home on the opening track- and the first single- \"Let's Go Higher\", which was co-written and produced by Akon protege Colby O'Donis. He inexplicably uses Auto-Tune on the title track \"Unfinished\", while getting sensual on the uptempo \"Like A Wave\". Hip hop producer\/DJ Clinton Sparks handles the production on the house music inspired \"One More Night\", while \"Stingy\" bears an uncanny nod to PM Dawn's \"Set Adrift On Memory Bliss\". Ryan Tedder of One Republic produces two piano driven ballads- the break up centered \"Kiss It Away\" as well as \"Inside\". J.R. Hutson- who's best known for his work with neo-soul singers Musiq Soulchild, Eric Roberson and Jill Scott- produces the sexually charged uptempo track \"O-Face\". He sings of a mystery woman on \"Rockstar\" and closes the album with the staccato ballad \"Believe\". Overall, Jordan Knight's \"Unfinished\" is a decent record, but suffers from too a few uptempo tracks that sound out of place for him. As with every album by Jordan, the ballads are the songs that do his vocals justice. Despite that obvious flaw, the positives far outweigh the negatives for this recording.","classification":4,"fold":7}
{"text":"There is a story behind my finding this song.  For some reason, the Sixpence None The Richer version of this song was all over the place.  I suspect it was connected to some commercial or another.  I liked the tune a great deal and wanted to have it in my collection.  But if you want rabbit stew you have to have a rabbit.  Without knowing the song title or the artists it was an uphill battle.  By memorizing some of the lyrics I was able to Google to lyric sites and it wasn't long before I got what I needed.\n\nThere are a few covers of the song out and about, but I rate the La's version a strong B+ and the Sixpence None The Richer version a solid A.  But I decided to buy both and they are a great addition to almost any rock\/pop collection.","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Sho Baraka is known for making his listeners think, and he takes everything a step farther by directly challenging the faith in a way that even the artists from Reach Records won't do. Thats big. Talented Tenth is a reference to the essay W.E.B. Dubois wrote during his rivalry with Booker T. Washington over issues regarding the education of African-Americans. Dubois argued that there were unfound talents among the black race, and they should be harvested upon to show America how the black race can be educated to great extent. Therefore, we have a concept album on our hands, and those are the most exciting ones to review, if not the most tricky. Sho uses some objectionable language in the album, and I'll be the first to admit that despite my faith, I catch myself spilling some curse words too. Therefore, I was not offended, just surprised. And it definitely accomplished its goal of making me think, albeit not quite the way he likely intended.\n\nSho's lyrics are thoughtful, and he is possibly the deepest rapper in CCR besides Lecrae. However, my beef with the album is the quality of the music, not the message. Sho is pretty limited in his flow, and his rapping mixed with some great beats only results in a solid album, at best. Peter Pan is a good track, and the controversial song, Jim Crow, is a real thought-provoker. I personally didn't like it.\n\nThe song was well-produced, and there were some phenomenal lines on it, but while Sho succeeds in elaborating on the present day racism he has seen, the song fails in a bigger way. By talking solely about racism with African-Americans, he alienates other races, some of which have to deal with worse racism at this point in time. Many of them are not in the States. The song also comes off as whiney, and it reminds me of a lot of people in my high school. Black racism is scowled upon, yet both black people, and whte people seem to think it more acceptable to pile onto the Mexicans, or Asians. I kind of wish Baraka could have used his great talents to make a bolder track about racism in general, calling out all sorts of people. Something like Bizzle would do. Instead, he drops somewhat cliche lines about Hollywood using the black people to get white people rich, and stuff like that. Overall, the song is pretty good, but in so many ways, I hated it.\n\nUnfortunately, I found myself skipping songs because no matter how hard-hitting the message, I sometimes (maybe even a lot) got bored, and occasionally even kind of angry.","classification":2,"fold":7}

{"text":"Probably like most people here, I fell for The XX's debut album, intrigued by the mix of minimalism and suggested beats. I saw the band perform at Coachella when they were touring in support of the debut album, and I think that co-founders\/singers Oliver Sims and Romy Madley Croft were as surprised with the massive crowd reaction as anyone. Now comes the band's highly anticipated second album.\n\n\"Coexist\" (11 tracks; 37 min.) starts off with \"Angels\", a very quiet and minimalist track, as if we were dropped straight halfway into an album. \"Chained\" is slightly more beat-oriented. The first song on here that truly peaks my interest is \"Try\", one-third into the album. \"Sunset\" is another intriguing tune. But let's be honest: most of the songs on here are introverted, pensive and moody. If that is what you are ready for, then this album is for you. For those that write that \"Coexist\" picks up where the debut album left off, I respectfully disagree. The XX had a choice to make with this second album: stick to the tried-and-true formula of the debut album, go for even more dance-oriented material, or make a left turn altogether and become more introspective. The band chose the latter direction, and that's fine. Sometimes I'm in the mood for something like this. But \"Coexist\" is NOT \"The XX 2\".\n\nLast weekend I saw The XX in concert at the Corona Capital music festival in Mexico City (the Mexican equivalent of Coachella). Once again., the live set was outstanding. The band divided their set evenly between the two albums (playing 8 tracks from each), and I must tell you that each one of the 8 tracks from \"Coexist\" sounded so much better (bigger, harder, more thrilling) live than it does on the album. If you have a chance to see The XX in concert, do not miss them!","classification":4,"fold":7}

{"text":"Played the original theme song more times than I can count.\n\nThe original was about how people in fear have the Ghostbusters to call.  How when in danger they have heroes to turn to.  The original inspired and entertained.  The music energized fans everywhere, and the Ray Parker Jr.'s voice was powerful.\n\nThis music sucked, and the verses were distort versions of the original.  It wasn't even a single singer doing it.  They had one singer doing the main bit, and then a separate rap singer for some.  And it didn't even seem like singing at many points - just fanatically chanting \"I'm not Afraid\"","classification":1,"fold":7}

She is a terrible role model, she is just as bad as Lindsay Lohan. Winehouse can't sing, she thinks she is some rockin' soul singer from the 1960's but she isn't, she is just a wannabe. Take my advice and stay away from this over-rated album, but if you like to hear a troubled and pathetic woman whining about going to rehab which is where she is now, then this album should make you happy.","classification":1,"fold":7}

{"text":"When it has came down to Rihanna, musically she has made some of the worst song out there for the past several years. She has been so overexposed, and yet she still needs to really find her voice. Her latest song, Birthday Cake from Talk That Talk was really short absolutely disgraceful from start to finish. Not only is it terrible and short, but what really gets me angry is the remix of her song, as she collaborates with the man whom had assaulted her and abused her at The Grammy awards 3 years ago, Chris Brown. It definitely has wasted Rihanna's credibility away as a performer by a lot, and when I said she really needs to find her voice, she definitely doesn't feel like she has one anymore. Maybe, Rihanna should just go away for a long while, then come back as a real singer.\n\nSong: F","classification":1,"fold":7}

{"text":"Rob Thomas is in the top 2 of greatest musical minds today, and with Matchbox 20 he crafted excellent songs, and some of the best melodies and lyrics the world has seen. However, for reasons still escaping me, he went solo, and this song defines his solo work thus far. Now from what I've said so far, you might say, this must be an awesome song, right? Wrong. The problem with the majority of Thomas' solo work is that the music has the ability to soar, the potential, the need and the want to soar, but like a Penguin, it stays on the ground. How this could be, I don't know. Without the song taking off, it ends up a boring lazy mess, that is topped with a chorus that could have been a whole lot better.\n\nOverall, not a great song to say the least. It's radio-friendly (which I cringe to hear it everytime it comes on), it's poorly done, and most of all, it's just flat-out boring. Sorry Rob, you've done better. A whole lot better.","classification":1,"fold":7}
