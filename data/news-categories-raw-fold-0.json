Meanwhile, on Thursday the Obama administration released a list of 55 higher education institutions under investigation for not adequately handling allegations of sexual assault. The scrutiny and transparency are good first steps but real progress would mean greatly reducing the assaults themselves.

The next night, when asked if women who have abortions should be punished, he replied, \"there has to be some form of punishment.\" And no, this wasn't an early April Fool's joke. He walked back the statement the next day, but perhaps this is the reason why three-quarters of women view him unfavorably. But as extreme as the statement was, it's worth noting that mainstream Republican policy has been punishing women seeking abortions for years at the state level - putting up unnecessary roadblocks, mandating outdated procedures and making life as miserable as possible for vulnerable women.
